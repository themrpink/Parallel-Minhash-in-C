Brown was born in [[Cincinnati]].&lt;ref name=ATuttascuola&gt;[http://www.atuttascuola.it/liceo/deciechi/la_sentinella_di_fredric_brown.htm Italian short bio at Tuttascuola.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =BlogUrania&gt;[http://blog.librimondadori.it/blogs/urania/2014/05/01/fredric-brown-vagabondo-nello-spazio-della-mente/ Introduction to ''Rogue in Space''], Italian edition,  [[Urania (magazine)|''Urania Collezione'']] n. 135, by [[Giuseppe Lippi]]&lt;/ref&gt; He began to sell mystery short stories to American magazines from 1936.&lt;ref name =BlogUrania/&gt; His first science fiction story, &quot;Not Yet the End&quot;, was published in the Winter 1941 issue of the magazine ''Captain Future''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?61748 Bibliography page at isfdb.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;djm&quot; /&gt;

His  science fiction novel ''[[What Mad Universe]]'' (1949) is a parody of [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] SF story conventions.  ''[[Martians, Go Home]]'' (1955) is both a broad farce and a satire on human frailties as seen through the eyes of a billion jeering, invulnerable Martians who arrive not to conquer the world but to drive it crazy.

''The Lights in the Sky Are Stars'' (1952) tells the story of an aging astronaut who is trying to get his beloved [[space program]] back on track after Congress has cut off the funds for it.

Brown's [[flash fiction]] short story &quot;The Hobbyist&quot; (1961) is about a man named Sangstrom, who is in a desperate search for an undetectable poison but winds up getting more than he bargained for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://devernay.free.fr/paradoxlost/html/hobbyist.html|title=Hobbyist|website=devernay.free.fr|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The best short stories of Fredric Brown.|last=1906-1972.|first=Brown, Fredric|date=1982|origyear=1961|publisher=New English Library|isbn=0450055019|location=Sevenoaks|oclc=10490737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[short story]] &quot;[[Arena (short story)|Arena]]&quot; was used as the basis for the [[Arena (TOS episode)|episode of the same name]] in the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original series of ''Star Trek'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;djm&quot; /&gt; It was also adapted in 1973 for issue 4 of [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Worlds Unknown]].''

Brown's first mystery novel, ''[[The Fabulous Clipjoint]]'', won the [[Edgar Award]] for outstanding first mystery novel.&lt;ref name=BlogUrania/&gt; It began a series starring Ed and Ambrose Hunter, and depicts how a young man gradually ripens into a detective under the tutelage of his uncle, an ex–private eye now working as a carnival concessionaire.&lt;ref name=BlogUrania/&gt;

Many of his books make use of the threat of the supernatural or occult before the &quot;straight&quot; explanation at the end. For example, &quot;Night of the Jabberwock&quot; is a  humorous narrative of an extraordinary day in the life of a small-town newspaper editor.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

''[[The Screaming Mimi (novel)|The Screaming Mimi]]'' (which became a 1958 movie starring [[Anita Ekberg]] and [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], and directed by [[Gerd Oswald]], who also directed the &quot;Fun and Games&quot; episode of [[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|''The Outer Limits'']], the plot of which was similar to Brown's short story &quot;Arena&quot;), and ''The Far Cry'' are noir suspense novels reminiscent of the work of [[Cornell Woolrich]]. ''The Lenient Beast'' experiments multiple first-person viewpoints, among them a gentle, deeply religious serial killer, and examines racial tensions between [[Anglos]] and [[Latinos]] in the US state of [[Arizona]]. ''Here Comes a Candle'' is told in straight narrative sections alternating with a radio script, a screenplay, a sportscast, a teleplay, a stage play, and a newspaper article.

== Popularity and influence ==
His short story &quot;[[Arena (short story)|Arena]]&quot; was voted by [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] as one of the top 20 SF stories written before 1965.  His 1945 short story &quot;The Waveries&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Jennre|url=http://jennre.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/the-waverlies-fredric-brown-1945/ |title=The Waveries synopsis|date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was described by [[Philip K. Dick]] as &quot;what may be the most significant—startlingly so—story SF has yet produced&quot;.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The opening of &quot;[[Knock (short-story)|Knock]]&quot; is a complete two-sentence short-short story in itself.

Brown was one of three dedicatees of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' (the other two being [[Robert Cornog]] and [[Philip José Farmer]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Nitrosyncretic.com|url=http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/dedications.html |title=Heinlein's Dedications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his non-fiction book ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]'' (1981), a survey of the horror genre since 1950, writer [[Stephen King]] includes an appendix of &quot;roughly one hundred&quot; influential books of the period: Fredric Brown's short-story collection ''Nightmares and Geezenstacks'' is included, and is, moreover, asterisked as being among those select works King regards as &quot;particularly important&quot;.

Brown's short story &quot;Naturally&quot; was adapted into ''[[Geometria (film)|Geometria]]'', a short film by director [[Guillermo del Toro]]. Another short story, &quot;The Last Martian&quot;, was adapted into &quot;Human Interest Story&quot;, an episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''.

In the third episode of the third series of Amazon's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's ''[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man In The High Castle]]'' Oberstgruppenführer Smith remarks, when told of the possibility of travel between worlds, that &quot;this is like something out of Fredric Brown&quot;, implying that Brown's work is known in the German-occupied areas of the former United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|VP9wkTEgORI|title=&quot;The Man in the High Castle Season 3 - Exclusive: New York Comic Con Sneak Peek&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His novel ''The Lights in the Sky Are Stars'' gives its name to the final episode of 2007 anime ''[[Gurren Lagann]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=imdb.com|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1785142/?ref_=ttep_ep27 |title=Tengen toppa gurren lagann (2007) - The Lights in the Sky Are Stars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] in his book &quot;On Ugliness&quot; describes Brown's short story &quot;Sentry&quot; as, &quot;one of the finest short stories produced by contemporary science fiction&quot; and uses its twist ending as an example of how ugliness and aesthetics are relative to different cultures. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eco |first1=Umberto |title=On Ugliness |date=2011 |publisher=Rizzoli |isbn=978-0847837236 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''&quot;Bounded&quot; and &quot;boundary&quot; are distinct concepts; for the latter see [[boundary (topology)]]. A [[circle]] in isolation is a boundaryless bounded set, while the [[half plane]] is unbounded yet has a boundary.
In [[mathematical analysis]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is called '''bounded''' if it is, in a certain sense, of finite size. Conversely, a set which is not bounded is called '''unbounded'''. The word 'bounded' makes no sense in a general topological space without a corresponding [[Metric_(mathematics)|metric]].

== Definition in the real numbers ==
[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|A real set with upper bounds and its [[supremum]].]]
A set ''S'' of [[real number]]s is called ''bounded from above'' if there exists some real number ''k'' (not necessarily in ''S'') such that ''k'' ≥ '' s'' for all ''s'' in ''S''. The number ''k'' is called an '''upper bound''' of ''S''. The terms ''bounded from below'' and '''lower bound''' are similarly defined.

A set ''S'' is '''bounded''' if it has both upper and lower bounds. Therefore, a set of real numbers is bounded if it is contained in a [[interval (mathematics)|finite interval]].

== Definition in a metric space ==

A [[subset]] ''S'' of a [[metric space]] (''M'', ''d'') is '''bounded''' if there exists ''r'' &gt; 0 such that for all ''s'' and ''t'' in ''S'', we have d(''s'', ''t'') &lt; ''r''. (''M'', ''d'') is a ''bounded'' metric space (or ''d'' is a ''bounded'' metric) if ''M'' is bounded as a subset of itself.

*[[Total boundedness]] implies boundedness. For subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; the two are equivalent.
*A metric space is [[compact space|compact]] if and only if it is [[Complete metric space|complete]] and totally bounded.
*A subset of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is compact if and only if it is [[closed set|closed]] and bounded.

== Boundedness in topological vector spaces ==
{{main|Bounded set (topological vector space)}}
In [[topological vector space]]s, a different definition for bounded sets exists which is sometimes called [[von Neumann bounded]]ness. If the topology of the topological vector space is induced by a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] which is [[homogeneous metric|homogeneous]], as in the case of a metric induced by the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of [[normed vector spaces]], then the two definitions coincide.

==Boundedness in order theory==

A set of real numbers is bounded if and only if it has an upper and lower bound. This definition is extendable to subsets of any [[partially ordered set]]. Note that this more general concept of boundedness does not correspond to a notion of &quot;size&quot;. 

A subset ''S'' of a partially ordered set ''P'' is called '''bounded above''' if there is an element ''k'' in ''P'' such that ''k'' ≥ ''s'' for all ''s'' in ''S''. The element ''k'' is called an '''upper bound''' of ''S''. The concepts of '''bounded below''' and '''lower bound''' are defined similarly.  (See also [[upper and lower bounds]].)

A subset ''S'' of a partially ordered set ''P'' is called '''bounded''' if it has both an upper and a lower bound, or equivalently, if it is contained in an [[Interval (mathematics)#Intervals in order theory|interval]]. Note that this is not just a property of the set ''S'' but also one of the set ''S'' as subset of ''P''.

A '''bounded poset''' ''P'' (that is, by itself, not as subset) is one that has a least element and a [[greatest element]]. Note that this concept of boundedness has nothing to do with finite size, and that a subset ''S'' of a bounded poset ''P'' with as order the [[Binary_relation#Restriction|restriction]] of the order on ''P'' is not necessarily a bounded poset.

A subset ''S'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is bounded with respect to the [[Euclidean distance]] if and only if it bounded as subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the [[product order]]. However, ''S'' may be bounded as subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the [[lexicographical order]], but not with respect to the Euclidean distance.

A class of [[ordinal number]]s is said to be unbounded, or [[Cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]], when given any ordinal, there is always some element of the class greater than it. Thus in this case &quot;unbounded&quot; does not mean unbounded by itself but unbounded as a subclass of the class of all ordinal numbers.

In [[mathematics]], a '''monotonic function''' (or '''monotone function''') is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] between [[List of order structures in mathematics|ordered sets]] that preserves or reverses the given [[order relation|order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics|last=Clapham|first=Christopher|last2=Nicholson|first2=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=|edition=5th|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MonotonicFunction.html|title=Monotonic Function|last=Stover|first=Christopher|website=Wolfram MathWorld|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Monotone_function|title=Monotone function|website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept first arose in [[calculus]], and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of [[order theory]].

== Monotonicity in calculus and analysis ==
In [[calculus]], a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined on a [[subset]] of the [[real numbers]] with real values is called '''monotonic''' if and only if it is either entirely non-increasing, or entirely non-decreasing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; That is, as per Fig. 1, a function that increases monotonically does not exclusively have to increase, it simply must not decrease.

A function is called '''monotonically increasing''' (also '''increasing''' or '''non-decreasing'''&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;), if for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \leq y&lt;/math&gt; one has  &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right) \leq f\!\left(y\right)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called '''monotonically decreasing''' (also '''decreasing''' or '''non-increasing'''&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;) if, whenever &lt;math&gt;x \leq y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right) \geq f\!\left(y\right)&lt;/math&gt;, so it ''reverses'' the order (see Figure 2).

If the order &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt;, then one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called '''strictly increasing'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called '''strictly decreasing'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; A function may be called '''strictly monotone''' if it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Functions that are strictly monotone are [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] (because for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; not equal to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x &gt; y&lt;/math&gt; and so, by monotonicity, either &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right) &lt; f\!\left(y\right)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right) &gt; f\!\left(y\right)&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right) \neq f\!\left(y\right)&lt;/math&gt;.)

If it is not clear that &quot;increasing&quot; and &quot;decreasing&quot; are taken to include the possibility of repeating the same value at successive arguments, one may use the terms '''weakly monotone''', '''weakly increasing''' and '''weakly decreasing''' to stress this possibility.

The terms &quot;non-decreasing&quot; and &quot;non-increasing&quot; should not be confused with the (much weaker) negative qualifications &quot;not decreasing&quot; and &quot;not increasing&quot;. For example, the function of figure 3 first falls, then rises, then falls again. It is therefore not decreasing and not increasing, but it is neither non-decreasing nor non-increasing.

A function &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''absolutely monotonic''' over an interval &lt;math&gt;\left(a, b\right)&lt;/math&gt; if the derivatives of all orders of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are [[nonnegative]] or all [[nonpositive]] at all points on the interval.

=== Inverse of function ===

A function that is monotonic, but not strictly monotonic, and thus constant on an interval, doesn't have an inverse.  This is because in order for a function to have an inverse, there needs to be a one-to-one mapping from the range to the domain of the function. Since a monotonic function has some values that are constant in its domain, this means that there would be more than one value in the range that maps to this constant value.

However, a function y=g(x) that is strictly monotonic, has an inverse function such that x=h(y) because there is guaranteed to always be a one-to-one mapping from range to domain of the function.  Also, a function can be said to be strictly monotonic on a range of values, and thus have an inverse on that range of value.  For example, if y=g(x) is strictly monotonic on the range [a,b], then it has an inverse x=h(y) on the range [g(a), g(b)], but we cannot say the entire range of the function has an inverse.

Note, some textbooks mistakenly state that an inverse exists for a monotonic function, when they really mean that an inverse exists for a strictly monotonic function.

=== Monotonic transformation ===

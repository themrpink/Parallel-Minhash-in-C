Meanwhile, he occupied his uneasy leisure with copious compositions. The mass of his prose dialogues on philosophical and ethical themes, which is very considerable, belong to the years of imprisonment in St. Anna.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Except for occasional odes or sonnets—some written at request, others inspired by his keen sense of suffering and therefore poignant—he neglected poetry. In the year 1580, he heard that part of the ''Gerusalemme'' was being published without his permission and without his corrections. The following year, the whole poem was given to the world, and in the following six months seven editions issued from the press.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The prisoner of St. Anna had no control over his editors; and from the masterpiece which placed him on the level of [[Petrarch]] and [[Ariosto]] he never derived one penny of pecuniary profit. A rival poet at the court of Ferrara undertook to revise and edit his lyrics in 1582. This was [[Giovanni Battista Guarini|Battista Guarini]]; and Tasso, in his cell, had to allow odes and sonnets, poems of personal feeling, occasional pieces of compliment, to be collected and emended, without lifting a voice in the matter.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

A few years later, in 1585, two Florentine pedants of the [[Crusca Academy]] declared war against the ''Gerusalemme''. They loaded it with insults, which seem to those who read their pamphlets now mere parodies of criticism. Yet Tasso felt bound to reply; and he did so with a moderation and urbanity which prove him to have been not only in full possession of his reasoning faculties, but a gentleman of noble manners also. The man, like [[Hamlet]], was distraught through ill-accommodation to his circumstances and his age; brain-sick he was undoubtedly; and this is the Duke of Ferrara's justification for the treatment he endured. In the prison he bore himself pathetically, peevishly, but never ignobly.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

What remained over, untouched by the malady, unoppressed by his consciousness thereof, displayed a sweet and gravely-toned humanity. The oddest thing about his life in prison is that he was always trying to place his two nephews, the sons of his sister Cornelia, in court-service. One of them he attached to [[Guglielmo I of Gonzaga|Guglielmo I, Duke of Mantua]], the other to [[Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===Late years===
[[File:Sorrent.Torquato Tasso.jpg|thumb |left| Torquato Tasso monument in [[Sorrento]]]]

In 1586 Tasso left St. Anna at the solicitation of [[Vincenzo Gonzaga]], Prince of Mantua. He followed his young deliverer to the city by the [[Mincio]], basked awhile in liberty and courtly pleasures, enjoyed a splendid reception from his paternal town of Bergamo, and reworked his 1573 tragedy ''Galealto Re di Norvegia'' into a classical drama entitled ''Torrismondo''. But only a few months had passed when he grew discontented. Vincenzo Gonzaga, succeeding to his father's dukedom of Mantua, had scanty leisure to bestow upon the poet. Tasso felt neglected. In the autumn of 1587 he journeyed through Bologna and Loreto to Rome, and taking up his quarters there with an old friend, [[Scipione Gonzaga]], now [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]]. Next year he wandered off to Naples, where he wrote several religious poems, including [[Monte Oliveto Maggiore|Monte Oliveto]]. In 1589 he returned to Rome, and took up his quarters again with the patriarch of Jerusalem. The servants found him insufferable, and turned him out of doors. He fell ill, and went to a hospital. The patriarch in 1590 again received him. But Tasso's restless spirit drove him forth to Florence. The Florentines said, &quot;Actum est de eo.&quot; Rome once more, then Mantua, then Florence, then Rome, then Naples, then Rome, then Naples—such is the weary record of the years 1590–94. He endured a veritable [[Odyssey]] of malady, indigence and misfortune. To Tasso everything came amiss. He had the palaces of princes, cardinals, patriarchs, nay popes, always open to him. Yet he could rest in none.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

His health grew ever feebler and his genius dimmer. In 1592, he published a revised version of the ''Gerusalemme'', ''Gerusalemme Conquistata''. All that made the poem of his early manhood charming he rigidly erased. The versification became more pedantic; the romantic and magical episodes were excised; the heavier elements of the plot underwent a dull rhetorical development. During the same year a blank-verse retelling of ''Genesis'', called ''Le Sette Giornate'', saw the light.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

When mental disorder, physical weakness, and decay of inspiration seemed dooming Tasso to oblivion, his last years were cheered with hope. Pope [[Clement VIII]] ascended the papal chair in 1592. He and his nephew, Cardinal Aldobrandini of [[San Giorgio al Velabro|San Giorgio]], determined to befriend the poet. In 1594, they invited him to Rome. There he was to receive the crown of laurels, as Petrarch had been crowned, on the Capitol.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Worn out with illness, Tasso reached Rome in November. The ceremony of his coronation was deferred because Cardinal Aldobrandini had fallen ill, but the pope assigned him a pension; and, under the pressure of pontifical remonstrance, Prince Avellino, who held Tasso's maternal estate, agreed to discharge a portion of his claims by payment of a yearly rent-charge.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

At no time since Tasso left St. Anna had the heavens apparently so smiled upon him. Capitolian honors and money were now at his disposal. Yet fortune came too late. Before he wore the crown of [[poet laureate]], or received his pensions, he ascended to the convent of Sant'Onofrio, on a stormy 1 April 1595. Seeing a cardinal's coach toil up the steep Trasteverine Hill, the monks came to the door to greet it. From the carriage stepped Tasso and told the prior he had come to die with him.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Tasso died in Sant'Onofrio in April 1595 aged 51. The last twenty years of his existence had been practically and artistically unsatisfying.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==Other works==
''Rime'' (Rhymes), nearly two thousand lyrics in nine books, were written between 1567 and 1593, influenced by [[Petrarch]]'s ''[[Canzoniere]]'' (''Songbook'').

''Galealto re di Norvegia'' (1573–4) is an unfinished tragedy, which was later finished under a new title: ''Re Torrismondo'' (1587). It is influenced by the tragedies of [[Sophocles]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and tells the story of princess Alvida of [[Norway]], who is forcibly married off to the [[Goths|Goth]] king Torrismondo, when she is devoted to her childhood friend, king Germondo of [[Sweden]].

''Dialoghi'' (''Dialogues''), written between 1578 and 1594. These 28 texts deal with issues from morality (love, virtue, nobility) to the mundane (masks, play, courtly style, beauty). Sometimes Tasso touches major themes of his time, such as religion vs. intellectual freedom; Christianity vs. Islam at [[Battle of Lepanto|Lepanto]].

''Discorsi del poema eroico'', published in 1594, is the main text for Tasso's [[poetics]]. It was probably written in the years while he was working on ''Gerusalemme Liberata''.

==Mental illness==
[[File:Trastevere - sant'Onofrio - chiostro esterno 3108-10.JPG|right|thumb|290px|The Convent of Sant'Onofrio]]
The disease Tasso began to suffer from is now believed to be [[bipolar disorder|bipolarity]]. Legends describe him wandering the streets of Rome half mad, convinced that he was being persecuted. After his lengthy imprisonment in [[Ferrara]]'s Santa Anna lunatic asylum, he was able to resume his writing, although he never fully recovered.

== Influence==
*Tasso's lyric poetry may have had some influence in late Renaissance France on [[Philippe Desportes|Desportes]] and [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] (whom Tasso met in Paris). It almost certainly influenced a number of English Elizabethans, including [[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney]], [[Abraham Fraunce]] and [[Samuel Daniel]].
*[[Claudio Monteverdi]] composed ''[[Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda]]'' upon the text of ''Gerusalemme Liberata'', canto XII. He also composed music over some of Tasso's ''Rime'', particularly [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s.
*[[Giaches de Wert]] and [[Carlo Gesualdo]] da Venosa put into music many texts from Tasso's ''Rime'' and ''Gerusalemme''.
*The German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] wrote a play, ''[[Torquato Tasso (play)|Torquato Tasso]]'', in 1790, which explores the struggles of the artist. He also composed a cantata text, &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, inspired by canto XVI of ''Jerusalem Delivered'', later set to music by [[Johannes Brahms]].
* [[Giacomo Leopardi]] wrote ''Dialogo di Torquato Tasso e del suo Genio familiare '' (''Operette morali'', 1824), a prose about the long stay in St. Anna. The main theme is a comparison between pain and boredom, expressed in a dialogue between Tasso and a &quot;Genius&quot;, or ghost, said to be visiting him in his loneliness.
*Among the numerous operas based on ''Jerusalem Delivered'' are works by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]], [[Luigi Cherubini|Cherubini]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]. An experimental modern opera on the theme, by Judith Weir, transposes the scene into contemporary Iraq.
*Both [[Edmund Spenser]] and [[John Milton]] were greatly influenced by Tasso's work.
*[[Lord Byron]]'s poem &quot;The Lament of Tasso&quot; narrates Tasso's spell in St. Anna's hospital.
*The Italian composer [[Gaetano Donizetti]] wrote an opera on the subject of ''[[Torquato Tasso (opera)|Torquato Tasso]]'' (1833) and incorporated some of the poet's writing into the [[libretto]].
*[[Felicia Hemans]]'s poem ''Tasso's Coronation'' records the poet's death immediately prior to his intended crowning.
*[[Franz Liszt]] composed a [[symphonic poem]], ''[[Tasso, Lamento e Trionfo (Liszt)|Tasso, Lamento e Trionfo]]'', in commemoration of the centenary of Goethe's birth. 
*Artists inspired by both ''Jerusalem Delivered'' and ''Aminta'' have been legion and include [[Tintoretto]], the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]], [[Guercino]], [[Pietro da Cortona]], [[Domenichino]], [[Cigoli]], [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]], [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], [[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]], [[Francesco Hayez|Hayez]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]].

==English translations==
During the Renaissance, the first (incomplete) translation of ''Jerusalem Delivered'' was brought out by [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] (1594). A complete version by [[Edward Fairfax]] appeared under the title ''Godfrey of Bouillon'' in 1600. [[John Hoole]]'s version in heroic couplets followed in 1772, and [[Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen]]'s (in Spenserian stanzas) in 1821. There were several 20th- and 21st-century versions, including by [[Anthony Esolen]] (2000) and by [[Max Wickert]], published as ''The Liberation of Jerusalem'' by Oxford University Press (2009). ''Aminta'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Aminta-Pastoral-Italica-Dual-Language-Documentary/dp/0934977658/ &quot;Aminta: A Pastoral Play&quot;], trans. and ed. by Charles Jernigan &amp; Irene Marchegiani Jones. New York: Italica Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; also his early love poems, as ''Love Poems for Lucrezia Bendidio'', ed. and trans. by Max Wickert. New York: Italica Press, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.amazon.com/Poems-Lucrezia-Bendidio-Torquato-Tasso/dp/1599102633/]&lt;/ref&gt; and as ''Rhymes of Love'', ed. M.H. and S. Acocella, trans. by Maria Pastore Passaro (Ottawa: Legas, 2011). Several of the &quot;Dialogues&quot;, &quot;Torrismondo,&quot; and some of the late religious works have also been issued in English.

==Legacy==
Tasso is commemorated by monuments in Bergamo and Sorrento.
There are streets named after him in virtually every major Italian city, most notably in [[Bergamo]], [[Posillipo]] ([[Naples]]), Rome, [[Turin]], [[Palermo]] and [[Catania]], as well as in [[Palo Alto]], California.

A '''polychlorinated biphenyl''' ('''PCB''') is an [[organochloride|organic chlorine compound]] with the formula [[Carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;[[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;10−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;[[Chloride|Cl]]&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Polychlorinated biphenyls were once widely deployed as [[dielectric]] and [[coolant]] fluids in electrical apparatus, [[carbonless copy paper]] and in heat transfer fluids.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann|doi=10.1002/14356007.a06_233.pub2 |title=Chlorinated Hydrocarbons |year=2006 |last1=Rossberg |first1=Manfred |last2=Lendle |first2=Wilhelm |last3=Pfleiderer |first3=Gerhard |last4=Tögel |first4=Adolf |last5=Dreher |first5=Eberhard-Ludwig |last6=Langer |first6=Ernst |last7=Rassaerts |first7=Heinz |last8=Kleinschmidt |first8=Peter |last9=Strack |first9=Heinz |last10=Cook |first10=Richard |last11=Beck |first11=Uwe |last12=Lipper |first12=Karl-August |last13=Torkelson |first13=Theodore R. |last14=Löser |first14=Eckhard |last15=Beutel |first15=Klaus K. |last16=Mann |first16=Trevor |isbn=3527306730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their longevity, PCBs are still widely in use, even though their manufacture has declined drastically since the 1960s, when a host of problems were identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Robertson, Larry W. |editor2=Hansen, Larry G. |title=PCBs: Recent advances in environmental toxicology and health effects |date=2001 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, KY |isbn=978-0813122267 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the discovery of PCBs' environmental [[toxicity]], and classification as [[persistent organic pollutant]]s, their production was banned by United States federal law in 1978, and by the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/oem.59.10.651 |title=Implementing the Stockholm Treaty on Persistent Organic Pollutants |year=2002 |last1=Porta |first1=M. |last2=Zumeta |first2=E. |journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=59 |issue=10 |pages=651–2 |pmid=12356922 |pmc=1740221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), rendered PCBs as definite carcinogens in humans.

The [[bromine]] analogues of PCBs are [[polybrominated biphenyl]]s (PBBs), which have analogous applications and environmental concerns.

PCBs do not easily break down or degrade, which made them attractive for industries. PCB mixtures are resistant to acids, bases, oxidation, hydrolysis, and temperature change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOvJCEEzlAgC |title=Halogenated Biphenyls, Terphenyls, Naphthalenes, Dibenzodioxins and Related Products |editor-last1=Kimbrough |editor-first1=R.

Intentional degradation as a treatment of unwanted PCBs generally requires high heat or [[catalysis]] (see [[polychlorinated biphenyl#Methods of destruction|Methods of destruction]] below).

PCBs readily penetrate [[absorption (skin)|skin]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] (polyvinyl chloride), and [[latex]] (natural rubber).&lt;ref name=&quot;anzecc&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Identifying PCB-Containing Capacitors |publisher=Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council |pages=4–5 |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-642-54507-7 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/publications/chemicals/scheduled-waste/pubs/pcbid.pdf |access-date=2007-07-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003010739/http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/publications/chemicals/scheduled-waste/pubs/pcbid.pdf |archive-date=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCB-resistant materials include [[Viton]], [[polyethylene]], [[polyvinyl acetate]] (PVA), [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE), [[butyl rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]], and [[Neoprene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anzecc&quot;/&gt;

===Structure and toxicity===
PCBs are derived from [[biphenyl]], which has the formula C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, sometimes written (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In PCBs, some of the hydrogen atoms in biphenyl are replaced by chlorine atoms. There are 209 different chemical compounds in which one to ten chlorine atoms can replace hydrogen atoms. PCBs are typically used as mixtures of compounds and are given the single identifying [[CAS registry number|CAS number]] {{CAS|1336-36-3}}. About 130 different individual PCBs are found in commercial PCB products.&lt;ref name=&quot;unep&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=UNEP Chemicals | title=Guidelines for the Identification of PCBs and Materials Containing PCBs | issue=1 | publisher=United Nations Environment Programme | year=1999 | pages=40 | url=http://www.chem.unep.ch/pops/pdf/PCBident/pcbid1.pdf | access-date=2007-11-07 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414094255/http://www.chem.unep.ch/pops/pdf/PCBident/pcbid1.pdf | archive-date=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

Toxic effects vary depending on the specific PCB. In terms of their structure and toxicity, PCBs fall into two distinct categories, referred to as coplanar or non-''ortho''-substituted [[arene substitution patterns]] and noncoplanar or ''ortho''-substituted congeners.

[[File:dl-PCB beschriftet.svg|thumb|upright=2|Structures of the twelve dioxin-like PCBs]]
;Coplanar or non-''ortho''
:The coplanar group members have a fairly rigid structure, with their two phenyl rings in the same plane. It renders their structure similar to [[polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins|polychlorinated dibenzo-''p''-dioxins]] (PCDDs) and [[polychlorinated dibenzofurans]], and allows them to act like PCDDs, as an agonist of the [[aryl hydrocarbon receptor]] (AhR) in organisms. They are considered as contributors to overall dioxin toxicity, and the term [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]] is often used interchangeably when the environmental and toxic impact of these compounds is considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/10408448409023762 |title=Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and Polybrominated Biphenyls (PBBs): Biochemistry, Toxicology, and Mechanism of Action |year=1984 |last1=Safe |first1=Stephen |last2=Hutzinger |first2=Otto |journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=319–395 |pmid=6091997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Stephen |last1=Safe |first2=Stelvio |last2=Bandiera |first3=Tom |last3=Sawyer |first4=Larry |last4=Robertson |first5=Lorna|last5=Safe |year=1985 |title=PCBs: Structure-Function Relationships and Mechanism of Action |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=60 |pages=47–56 |jstor=3429944 |pmid=2992927 |pmc=1568577 |doi=10.1289/ehp.856047|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Noncoplanar
:Noncoplanar PCBs, with chlorine atoms at the ''ortho'' positions can cause neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects, but only at concentrations much higher than those normally associated with dioxins. They do not activate the AhR, and are not considered part of the dioxin group. Because of their lower toxicity, they are of less concern to regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0378-4274(98)00334-8 |title=Developmental neurotoxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBS): Cognitive and psychomotor functions in 7-month old children |year=1998 |last1=Winneke |first1=Gerhard |last2=Bucholski |first2=Albert |last3=Heinzow |first3=Birger |last4=Krämer |first4=Ursula |last5=Schmidt |first5=Eberhard |journal=Toxicology Letters |volume=102–103 |pages=423–8 |pmid=10022290 |display-authors=etal |last6=Wiener |first6=J.

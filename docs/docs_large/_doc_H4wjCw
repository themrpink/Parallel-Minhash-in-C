In [[electrical engineering]], '''electrical impedance''' is the measure of the opposition that a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] presents to a [[electric current|current]] when a [[voltage]] is applied.

Quantitatively, the impedance of a two-terminal [[Electrical element|circuit element]] is the ratio of the complex representation of the [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] voltage between its terminals, to the complex representation of the current flowing through it.&lt;ref&gt;Callegaro, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it depends upon the [[frequency]] of the sinusoidal voltage. 

Impedance extends the concept of [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] to [[alternating current]] (AC) circuits, and possesses both magnitude and [[Phase (waves)|phase]], unlike resistance, which has only magnitude. When a circuit is driven with [[direct current]] (DC), there is no distinction between impedance and resistance; the latter can be thought of as impedance with zero [[phase (waves)|phase angle]].

Impedance is a [[complex number]], with the same units as resistance, for which the [[SI unit]] is the [[ohm]] ({{math|Ω}}).
Its symbol is usually {{math|''Z''}}, and it may be represented by writing its magnitude and phase in the [[Polar coordinate system|polar]] form {{math|{{!}}''Z''{{!}}''∠θ''}}. However, [[Complex plane|cartesian complex number representation]] is often more powerful for circuit analysis purposes.

The notion of impedance is useful for performing AC analysis of [[Electrical network|electrical networks]], because it allows relating sinusoidal voltages and currents by a simple linear law.  
In multiple [[Port (circuit theory)|port]] networks, the two-terminal definition of impedance is inadequate, but the complex voltages at the ports and the currents flowing through them are still [[Linear relation|linearly related]] by the [[Impedance parameters|impedance matrix]].&lt;ref&gt;Callegaro, Sec. 1.6&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of impedance is [[admittance]], whose [[SI]] unit is the [[siemens (unit)|siemens]], formerly called [[mho]].

Instruments used to measure the electrical impedance are called [[impedance analyzer]]s.

==Introduction==

The term ''impedance'' was coined by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in July 1886.&lt;ref&gt;''Science'', p.&amp;nbsp;18, 1888&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Heaviside, ''The Electrician'', p.&amp;nbsp;212, 23 July 1886, reprinted as ''Electrical Papers, Volume II'', p 64, AMS Bookstore, {{ISBN|0-8218-3465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Kennelly]] was the first to represent impedance with complex numbers in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4768008 Kennelly, Arthur. ''Impedance'' (AIEE, 1893)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to resistance as seen in DC circuits, impedance in AC circuits includes the effects of the induction of voltages in conductors by the [[magnetic field]]s ([[inductance]]), and the electrostatic storage of charge induced by voltages between conductors ([[capacitance]]). The impedance caused by these two effects is collectively referred to as [[electrical reactance|reactance]] and forms the [[imaginary number|imaginary]] part of complex impedance whereas resistance forms the [[real number|real]] part.

Impedance is defined as the [[frequency domain]] ratio of the voltage to the current.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Alexander | first = Charles | last2 = Sadiku | first2 = Matthew | title = Fundamentals of Electric Circuits | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2006 | edition = 3, revised | pages =387–389 | isbn = 978-0-07-330115-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is the voltage–current ratio for a single [[complex exponential]] at a particular frequency {{math|''ω''}}. 

For a sinusoidal current or voltage input, the [[Complex number#Notation of the polar form|polar form]] of the complex impedance relates the amplitude and phase of the voltage and current. In particular:
* The magnitude of the complex impedance is the ratio of the voltage amplitude to the current amplitude;
* The phase of the complex impedance is the [[phase shift]] by which the current lags the voltage.

==Complex impedance==

[[File:Complex Impedance.svg|200px|thumb|right|A graphical representation of the [[Complex plane|complex impedance plane]]]]

The impedance of a two-terminal circuit element is represented as a [[Complex number|complex]] quantity &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Polar coordinates|polar form]] conveniently captures both magnitude and phase characteristics as

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z = |Z| e^{j \arg(Z) }&lt;/math&gt;

where the magnitude &lt;math&gt;|Z|&lt;/math&gt; represents the ratio of the voltage difference amplitude to the current amplitude, while the argument &lt;math&gt;\arg(Z)&lt;/math&gt; (commonly given the symbol &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt;) gives the phase difference between voltage and current. &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]], and is used instead of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in this context to avoid confusion with the symbol for [[Ampere|electric current]].

In [[Cartesian plane|Cartesian form]], impedance is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z = R + jX&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[real part]] of impedance is the resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and the [[imaginary part]] is the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Where it is needed to add or subtract impedances, the cartesian form is more convenient; but when quantities are multiplied or divided, the calculation becomes simpler if the polar form is used. A circuit calculation, such as finding the total impedance of two impedances in parallel, may require conversion between forms several times during the calculation. Conversion between the forms follows the normal [[Polar form|conversion rules of complex numbers]].

== Complex voltage and current ==
[[File:Impedance symbol comparison.svg|thumb|right|165px|Generalized impedances in a circuit can be drawn with the same symbol as a resistor (US ANSI or DIN Euro) or with a labeled box.]]
To simplify calculations, [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al voltage and current waves are commonly represented as complex-valued functions of time denoted as &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/impcom.html#c1 Complex impedance], Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HH2&gt;{{cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Paul |author2=Hill, Winfield |title=The Art of Electronics |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-37095-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofelectronics00horo/page/31 31–32] |chapter=1 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/artofelectronics00horo |url=https://archive.org/details/artofelectronics00horo/page/31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  V &amp;= |V|e^{j(\omega t + \phi_V)}, \\
  I &amp;= |I|e^{j(\omega t + \phi_I)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The impedance of a bipolar circuit is defined as the ratio of these quantities:

:&lt;math&gt; Z = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{|V|}{|I|}e^{j(\phi_V - \phi_I)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, denoting &lt;math&gt;\theta = \phi_V - \phi_I&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     |V| &amp;= |I| |Z|, \\
  \phi_V &amp;= \phi_I + \theta.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude equation is the familiar Ohm's law applied to the voltage and current amplitudes, while the second equation defines the phase relationship.

=== Validity of complex representation ===
This representation using complex exponentials may be justified by noting that (by [[Euler's formula]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\ \cos(\omega t + \phi) = \frac{1}{2} \Big[ e^{j(\omega t + \phi)} + e^{-j(\omega t + \phi)}\Big]&lt;/math&gt;

The real-valued sinusoidal function representing either voltage or current may be broken into two complex-valued functions. By the principle of [[superposition principle|superposition]], we may analyse the behaviour of the sinusoid on the left-hand side by analysing the behaviour of the two complex terms on the right-hand side. Given the symmetry, we only need to perform the analysis for one right-hand term. The results are identical for the other. At the end of any calculation, we may return to real-valued sinusoids by further noting that

:&lt;math&gt;\ \cos(\omega t + \phi) = \Re \Big\{ e^{j(\omega t + \phi)} \Big\}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Ohm's law ===
[[File:General AC circuit.svg|thumb|right|165px|An AC supply applying a voltage &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, across a [[Electrical load|load]] &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, driving a current &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;]]
{{Main|Ohm's law}}

The meaning of electrical impedance can be understood by substituting it into Ohm's law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/imped.html AC Ohm's law], Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HH1&gt;{{cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Paul |author2=Hill, Winfield |title=The Art of Electronics |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-37095-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofelectronics00horo/page/32 32–33] |chapter=1 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/artofelectronics00horo |url=https://archive.org/details/artofelectronics00horo/page/32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Assuming a two-terminal circuit element with impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is driven by a sinusoidal voltage or current as above, there holds  

:&lt;math&gt;\ V = I Z = I |Z| e^{j \arg (Z)}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude of the impedance &lt;math&gt;|Z|&lt;/math&gt; acts just like resistance, giving the drop in voltage amplitude across an impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; for a given current &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. The [[phase factor]] tells us that the current lags the voltage by a phase of &lt;math&gt;\theta \;=\; \arg(Z)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., in the [[time domain]], the current signal is shifted &lt;math&gt;\frac{\theta}{2 \pi} T&lt;/math&gt; later with respect to the voltage signal).

Just as impedance extends Ohm's law to cover AC circuits, other results from DC circuit analysis, such as [[Voltage divider|voltage division]], [[Current divider|current division]], [[Thévenin's theorem]] and [[Norton's theorem]], can also be extended to AC circuits by replacing resistance with impedance.

=== Phasors ===
{{Main|Phasor (electronics)}}
{{Further|Analytic representation}}

A phasor is represented by a constant complex number, usually expressed in exponential form, representing the complex amplitude (magnitude and phase) of a sinusoidal function of time. Phasors are used by electrical engineers to simplify computations involving sinusoids, where they can often reduce a differential equation problem to an algebraic one.

The impedance of a circuit element can be defined as the ratio of the phasor voltage across the element to the phasor current through the element, as determined by the relative amplitudes and phases of the voltage and current. This is identical to the definition from [[Electrical impedance#Ohm's law|Ohm's law]] given above, recognising that the factors of &lt;math&gt;e^{j\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; cancel.

== Device examples ==

===Resistor===
[[File:VI phase.svg|thumb|right|250px|The phase angles in the equations for the impedance of capacitors and inductors indicate that the voltage across a capacitor ''lags'' the current through it by a phase of &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;, while the voltage across an inductor ''leads'' the current through it by &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;. The identical voltage and current amplitudes indicate that the magnitude of the impedance is equal to one.]]

The impedance of an ideal [[resistor]] is purely real and is called ''resistive impedance'':

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_R = R&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the voltage and current waveforms are proportional and in phase.

===Inductor and capacitor===
Ideal [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s have a purely [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] ''reactive impedance'':

the impedance of inductors increases as frequency increases;

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_L = j\omega L&lt;/math&gt;

the impedance of capacitors decreases as frequency increases;

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_C = \frac{1}{j\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

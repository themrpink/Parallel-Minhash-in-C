where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is pressure (usually in [[Pascals]]), &lt;math&gt;I_f&lt;/math&gt; is the incident [[irradiance]] (usually in W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.

If the surface is planar at an angle &amp;alpha; to the incident wave, the intensity across the surface will be geometrically reduced by the cosine of that angle and the component of the radiation force against the surface will also be reduced by the cosine of &amp;alpha;, resulting in a pressure:

:&lt;math&gt; P_\text{incident} = \frac{I_f}{c} \cos^2 \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

The momentum from the incident wave is in the same direction of that wave.  But only the component of that momentum normal to the surface contributes to the pressure on the surface, as given above.  The component of that force tangent to the surface is not called pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot;&gt;

=== Radiation pressure from reflection ===
The above treatment for an incident wave accounts for the radiation pressure experienced by a black (totally absorbing) body. If the wave is [[specularly reflected]], then the recoil due to the reflected wave will further contribute to the radiation pressure. In the case of a perfect reflector, this pressure will be identical to the pressure caused by the incident wave:

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{emitted}= \frac{I_f}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

thus ''doubling'' the net radiation pressure on the surface:

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{net}=   P_\text{incident} +  P_\text{emitted}= 2 \frac{I_f}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

For a partially reflective surface, the second term must be multiplied by the reflectivity (also known as reflection coefficient of intensity), so that the increase is less than double. For a [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely reflective]] surface, the details of the reflection and geometry must be taken into account, again resulting in an increased net radiation pressure of less than double.

===Radiation pressure by emission===
Just as a wave reflected from a body contributes to the net radiation pressure experienced, a body that emits radiation of its own (rather than reflected) obtains a radiation pressure again given by the irradiance of that emission ''in the direction normal to the surface'' ''I&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{emitted}= \frac{I_e}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

The emission can be from [[black-body radiation]] or any other radiative mechanism. Since all materials emit black-body radiation (unless they are totally reflective or at absolute zero), this source for radiation pressure is ubiquitous but usually very tiny. However, because black-body radiation increases rapidly with temperature (according to the fourth power of temperature as given by the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]), radiation pressure due to the temperature of a very hot object (or due to incoming black-body radiation from similarly hot surroundings) can become very significant. This becomes important in stellar interiors which are at millions of degrees.

=== Radiation pressure in terms of photons ===
{{See also|Photons|Momentum}}
Electromagnetic radiation can be [[wave–particle duality|viewed]] in terms of particles rather than waves; these particles are known as [[photons]]. Photons do not have a rest-mass; however, photons are never at rest (they move at the speed of light) and acquire a momentum nonetheless which is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
p = \dfrac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{E_p}{c},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' is momentum, ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], &amp;lambda; is [[wavelength]], and ''c'' is speed of light in vacuum. And ''E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the energy of a single photon given by: 
:&lt;math&gt;
E_p = h \nu =\frac{h c}{\lambda}
&lt;/math&gt;

The radiation pressure again can be seen as the transfer of each photon's momentum to the opaque surface, plus the momentum due to a (possible) recoil photon for a (partially) reflecting surface. Since an incident wave of irradiance ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' over an area ''A'' has a power of  ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;A'', this implies a flux of ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' photons per second per unit area striking the surface. Combining this with the above expression for the momentum of a single photon, results in the same relationships between irradiance and radiation pressure described above using classical electromagnetics. And again, reflected or otherwise emitted photons will contribute to the net radiation pressure identically.

===Compression in a uniform radiation field===

In general, the pressure of electromagnetic waves can be obtained from the [[Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor#Algebraic properties|vanishing of the trace of the electromagnetic stress tensor]]: Since this trace [[Stress–energy tensor#Stress–energy of a fluid in equilibrium|equals 3''P'' – ''u'']], we get
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{u}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''u'' is the radiation energy per unit volume.

This can also be shown in the specific case of the pressure exerted on surfaces of a body in [[thermal equilibrium]] with its surroundings, at a temperature ''T'': The body will be surrounded by a uniform radiation field described by the [[Planck law|Planck black-body radiation law]], and will experience a compressive pressure due to that impinging radiation, its reflection, and its own black body emission. From that it can be shown that the resulting pressure is equal to one third of the total radiant energy per unit volume in the surrounding space.&lt;ref&gt;Shankar R., ''Principles of Quantum Mechanics'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Bradley W.  &amp; Dale A. Ostlie, ''An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, John David, (1999) ''Classical Electrodynamics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kardar, Mehran. &quot;Statistical Physics of Particles&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

By using [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], this can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{compress} = \frac{u}{3} = \frac{4\sigma}{3c} T^4 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]].

==Solar radiation pressure==

Solar radiation pressure is due to the sun's radiation at closer distances, thus especially within the [[Solar System]].  (The radiation pressure of sunlight on earth is very small: it is equivalent to that exerted by about a thousandth of a gram on an area of 1 square metre, or 10 μN/m2.) While it acts on all objects, its net effect is generally greater on smaller bodies since they have a larger ratio of surface area to mass.  All spacecraft experience such a pressure except when they are behind the shadow of a larger [[orbiting body]].

Solar radiation pressure on objects near the earth may be calculated using the sun's [[irradiance]] at 1&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]], known as the [[solar constant]] or ''G&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'', whose value is set at '''1361&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]]/[[Metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

All stars have a [[spectral energy distribution]] that depends on their surface temperature.  The distribution is approximately that of [[black-body radiation]].  This distribution must be taken into account when calculating the radiation pressure or identifying reflector materials for optimizing a [[solar sail]] for instance.

===Pressures of absorption and reflection===

Solar radiation pressure at the Earth's distance from the Sun, may be calculated by dividing the [[solar constant]] ''G&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'' (above) by the [[speed of light]] c.  For an absorbing sheet facing the Sun, this is simply:&lt;ref name=&quot;RMG&quot;&gt;Georgevic, R. M. (1973) &quot;The Solar Radiation Pressure Forces and Torques Model&quot;, ''The Journal of the Astronautical Sciences'', Vol. 27, No. 1, Jan–Feb. First known publication describing how solar radiation pressure creates forces and torques that affect spacecraft.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; P  = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c}  \approx  4.5 \cdot 10^{-6}~{\rm Pa} = 4.5~\mu {\rm Pa} &lt;/math&gt;

This result is in the [[S.I.]] unit [[Pascals]], equivalent to N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[newton (unit)|newtons]] per square meter). For a sheet at an angle α to the Sun, the effective area ''A'' of a sheet is reduced by a geometrical factor resulting in a force ''in the direction of the sunlight'' of:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c } (A \cos \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

To find the component of this force normal to the surface, another cosine factor must be applied resulting in a pressure ''P'' on the surface of:

:&lt;math&gt; P  =  \frac{F}{A} = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c} \cos^2 \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

Note, however, that in order to account for the net effect of solar radiation on a spacecraft for instance, one would need to consider the ''total'' force (in the direction away from the Sun) given by the preceding equation, rather than just the component normal to the surface that we identify as &quot;pressure&quot;.

The solar constant is defined for the Sun's radiation at the distance to the Earth, also known as one [[astronomical unit]] (au). Consequently, at a distance of ''R'' astronomical units (''R'' thus being dimensionless), applying the [[inverse-square law]], we would find:

:&lt;math&gt; P  = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c R^2} \cos^2 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, considering not an absorbing but a perfectly reflecting surface, the pressure is ''doubled'' due to the reflected wave, resulting in:

:&lt;math&gt; P = 2\frac{G_\text{SC}}{c R^2} \cos^2 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Note that unlike the case of an absorbing material, the resulting force on a reflecting body is given exactly by this pressure acting normal to the surface, with the tangential forces from the incident and reflecting waves canceling each other. In practice, materials are neither totally reflecting nor totally absorbing, so the resulting force will be a weighted average of the forces calculated using these formulae.

===Radiation pressure perturbations===
{{See also|Yarkovsky effect|YORP effect|Poynting–Robertson effect}}

Solar radiation pressure is a source of [[Perturbation (astronomy)|orbital perturbations]].  It significantly affects the orbits and trajectories of small bodies including all spacecraft.

Solar radiation pressure affects bodies throughout much of the Solar System.  Small bodies are more affected than large ones because of their lower mass relative to their surface area.  Spacecraft are affected along with natural bodies (comets, asteroids, dust grains, gas molecules).

The radiation pressure results in forces and torques on the bodies that can change their translational and rotational motions.  Translational changes affect the orbits of the bodies.  Rotational rates may increase or decrease.  Loosely aggregated bodies may break apart under high rotation rates.  Dust grains can either leave the Solar System or spiral into the Sun.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

A whole body is typically composed of numerous surfaces that have different orientations on the body.  The facets may be flat or curved.  They will have different areas.  They may have optical properties differing from other aspects.

At any particular time, some facets will be exposed to the Sun and some will be in shadow.  Each surface exposed to the Sun will be reflecting, absorbing, and emitting radiation.  Facets in shadow will be emitting radiation.  The summation of pressures across all of the facets will define the net force and torque on the body.  These can be calculated using the equations in the preceding sections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RMG&quot; /&gt;

The [[Yarkovsky effect]] affects the translation of a small body.  It results from a face leaving solar exposure being at a higher temperature than a face approaching solar exposure.  The radiation emitted from the warmer face will be more intense than that of the opposite face, resulting in a net force on the body that will affect its motion.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

The [[YORP effect]] is a collection of effects expanding upon the earlier concept of the Yarkovsky effect, but of a similar nature.  It affects the spin properties of bodies.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

The [[Poynting–Robertson effect]] applies to grain-size particles.  From the perspective of a grain of dust circling the Sun, the Sun's radiation appears to be coming from a slightly forward direction ([[aberration of light]]). Therefore, the absorption of this radiation leads to a force with a component against the direction of movement. (The angle of aberration is tiny since the radiation is moving at the speed of light while the dust grain is moving many orders of magnitude slower than that.)  The result is a gradual spiral of dust grains into the Sun.  Over long periods of time, this effect cleans out much of the dust in the Solar System.

While rather small in comparison to other forces, the radiation pressure force is inexorable.  Over long periods of time, the net effect of the force is substantial.  Such feeble pressures can produce marked effects upon minute particles like [[gas]] [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s, and are essential in the theory of electron emission from the Sun, of [[comet]]ary material, and so on.

Because the ratio of surface area to volume (and thus mass) increases with decreasing particle size, dusty ([[micrometre]]-size) particles are susceptible to radiation pressure even in the outer solar system.  For example, the evolution of the [[Rings of Saturn#Outer rings|outer rings of Saturn]] is significantly influenced by radiation pressure.

As a consequence of light pressure, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Einstein, A.|title=On the development of our views concerning the nature and constitution of radiation. Translated in: The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, vol. 2 (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1989)|date=1909|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1909 predicted the existence of &quot;radiation friction&quot; which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, &quot;radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backward acting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.&quot;

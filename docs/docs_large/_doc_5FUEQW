Herring has been a [[staple food]] source since at least 3000 BC. The fish is served numerous ways, and many regional recipes are used: eaten raw, fermented, [[pickling|pickled]], or cured by other techniques, such as being smoked as [[kipper]]s.

Herring are very high in the long-chain [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s [[eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080310164906.htm Cardiovascular Benefits Of Omega-3 Fatty Acids Reviewed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823070015/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080310164906.htm |date=2010-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are a source of [[vitamin D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Aro|first1=Tarja L.|last2=Larmo|first2=Petra S.|last3=Bäckman|first3=Christina H.|last4=Kallio|first4=Heikki P.|last5=Tahvonen|first5=Raija L.|date=2005-03-01|title=Fatty Acids and Fat-Soluble Vitamins in Salted Herring (Clupea harengus) Products|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1482–1488|doi=10.1021/jf0401221|pmid=15740028|issn=0021-8561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water pollution]] influences the amount of herring that may be safely consumed.  For example, large Baltic herring slightly exceeds recommended limits with respect to [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] and [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]], although some sources point out that the cancer-reducing effect of omega-3 fatty acids is statistically stronger than the cancer-causing effect of PCBs and dioxins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evira.fi/portal/en/evira/current_issues/?id=332 Risks and benefits are clarified by food risk assessment - Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005003740/http://www.evira.fi/portal/en/evira/current_issues/?id=332 |date=2007-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contaminant levels depend on the age of the fish which can be inferred from their size. Baltic herrings larger than 17&amp;nbsp;cm may be eaten twice a month, while herrings smaller than 17&amp;nbsp;cm can be eaten freely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evira.fi/portal/en/food/dietary_advice_on_fish_consumption/ Dietary advice on fish consumption - Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718190641/http://www.evira.fi/portal/en/food/dietary_advice_on_fish_consumption/ |date=2010-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mercury in fish]] also influences the amount of fish that women who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant within the next one or two years may safely eat.

==History==
The herring has played an enormous role in history both socially and economically.   During the Middle Ages, herring prompted the founding of [[Great Yarmouth]], [[Amsterdam]], and [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Kathy|title=Herring A Global History|date=2017|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd.|isbn=978-1-78023-831-9|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Socrates}}
{{Platonism}}

The '''Socratic method''' (also known as '''method of Elenchus''', '''elenctic method''', or '''Socratic debate''') is a form of cooperative [[Argumentation|argumentative]] [[dialogue]] between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate [[critical thinking]] and to draw out ideas and underlying [[presupposition]]s. It is named after the [[Classical Greek philosophy|Classical Greek]] philosopher [[Socrates]] and is introduced by him in [[Plato]]'s [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]] as midwifery ([[wikt:maieutic|maieutics]]) because it is employed to bring out definitions implicit in the interlocutors' beliefs, or to help them further their understanding.

The Socratic method is a method of hypothesis elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. 

The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other [[beliefs]]. The basic form is a series of questions formulated as tests of [[logic]] and fact intended to help a person or group discover their beliefs about some topic; exploring definitions, and seeking to characterize general characteristics shared by various particular instances.

==Development==
In the second half of the 5th century BC, [[sophists]] were teachers who specialized in using the tools of [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]] to entertain, impress, or persuade an audience to accept the speaker's point of view. Socrates promoted an alternative method of teaching, which came to be called the Socratic method.

Socrates began to engage in such discussions with his fellow [[Athens|Athenians]] after his friend from youth, [[Chaerephon]], visited the [[Pythia|Oracle of Delphi]], which asserted that no man in [[Greece]] was wiser than Socrates. Socrates saw this as a [[paradox]], and began using the Socratic method to answer his conundrum. [[Diogenes Laërtius]], however, wrote that [[Protagoras]] invented the “Socratic” method.&lt;ref&gt;Jarratt, Susan C. ''Rereading the Sophists: Classical Rhetoric Refigured''. Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991., p 83.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sprague|1972|page=5}}

[[Plato]] famously formalized the Socratic elenctic style in prose—presenting Socrates as the curious questioner of some prominent Athenian interlocutor—in some of his early [[dialogue]]s, such as ''[[Euthyphro]]'' and ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', and the method is most commonly found within the so-called &quot;[[Socratic dialogue]]s&quot;, which generally portray Socrates engaging in the method and questioning his fellow citizens about moral and [[epistemology|epistemological]] issues. But in his later [[dialogues]], such as [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]] or [[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]], Plato had a different method to philosophical discussions, namely [[dialectic]].

==Method==
'''Elenchus''' ({{lang-grc|ἔλεγχος|elenkhos|argument of disproof or refutation; cross-examining, testing, scrutiny esp. for purposes of refutation}}&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Scott and Jones, ''Greek-English Lexicon'', 9th Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the central technique of the Socratic method. The Latin form ''elenchus'' (plural ''elenchi'') is used in English as the technical philosophical term.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World College Dictionary'', 4th Edition; ''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common adjectival form in English is ''elenctic''; ''elenchic'' and ''elenchtic'' are also current.

In Plato's early dialogues, the elenchus is the technique Socrates uses to investigate, for example, the nature or definition of ethical concepts such as justice or virtue. According to Vlastos,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Vlastos, '[[The Socratic Elenchus]]', ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy I'', Oxford 1983, 27–58.&lt;/ref&gt; it has the following steps:

# Socrates' [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] asserts a thesis, for example &quot;Courage is endurance of the soul&quot;.
# Socrates decides whether the thesis is false and targets for refutation.
# Socrates secures his interlocutor's agreement to further premises, for example &quot;Courage is a fine thing&quot; and &quot;Ignorant endurance is not a fine thing&quot;.
# Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, these further premises imply the contrary of the original thesis; in this case, it leads to: &quot;courage is not endurance of the soul&quot;.
# Socrates then claims he has shown his interlocutor's thesis is false and its negation is true.

One elenctic examination can lead to a new, more refined, examination of the concept being considered, in this case it invites an examination of the claim: &quot;Courage is ''wise'' endurance of the soul&quot;. Most Socratic inquiries consist of a series of [[elenchi]] and typically end in puzzlement known as ''[[aporia]]''.

Frede&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frede, &quot;Plato's Arguments and the Dialogue Form&quot;, ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'', Supplementary Volume 1992, Oxford 1992, 201–19.&lt;/ref&gt; points out Vlastos' conclusion in step #4 above makes nonsense of the [[aporetic]] nature of the early dialogues. Having shown a proposed thesis is false is insufficient to conclude some other competing thesis must be true. Rather, the interlocutors have reached [[aporia]], an improved state of still not knowing what to say about the subject under discussion.

The exact nature of the elenchus is subject to a great deal of debate, in particular concerning whether it is a positive method, leading to knowledge, or a negative method used solely to refute false claims to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Salkever, [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1992/03.05.09.html &quot;Methods of Interpreting Plato and his Dialogues&quot;] ([[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. K. C. Guthrie]] in ''The Greek Philosophers'' sees it as an error to regard the Socratic method as a means by which one seeks the answer to a problem, or knowledge. Guthrie claims that the Socratic method actually aims to demonstrate one's ignorance. Socrates, unlike the [[Sophists]], did believe that knowledge was possible, but believed that the first step to knowledge was recognition of one's ignorance. Guthrie writes, &quot;[Socrates] was accustomed to say that he did not himself know anything, and that the only way in which he was wiser than other men was that he was conscious of his own ignorance, while they were not. The essence of the Socratic method is to convince the interlocutor that whereas he thought he knew something, in fact he does not.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]] (1968) ''The Greek Philosophers from Thales to Aristotle'', page 74, London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

Socrates generally applied his method of examination to concepts that seem to lack any concrete definition; e.g., the key moral concepts at the time, the [[virtue]]s of [[piety]], [[wisdom]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[courage]], and [[justice]]. Such an examination challenged the implicit moral beliefs of the interlocutors, bringing out inadequacies and inconsistencies in their beliefs, and usually resulting in [[aporia]]. In view of such inadequacies, Socrates himself professed his ignorance, but others still claimed to have knowledge. Socrates believed that his awareness of his ignorance made him wiser than those who, though ignorant, still claimed knowledge. While this belief seems paradoxical at first glance, it in fact allowed Socrates to discover his own errors where others might assume they were correct. This claim was based on a reported Delphic oracular pronouncement that no man was wiser than Socrates.

Socrates used this claim of wisdom as the basis of his moral exhortation. Accordingly, he claimed that the chief goodness consists in the caring of the soul concerned with moral truth and moral understanding, that &quot;wealth does not bring goodness, but goodness brings wealth and every other blessing, both to the individual and to the state&quot;, and that &quot;life without examination [dialogue] is not worth living&quot;. It is with this in mind that the Socratic method is employed.

The motive for the modern usage of this method and Socrates' use are not necessarily equivalent. Socrates rarely used the method to actually develop consistent theories, instead using [[mythology|myth]] to explain them. The [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides dialogue]] shows [[Parmenides]] using the Socratic method to point out the flaws in the Platonic [[Theory of Forms|theory of the Forms]], as presented by Socrates; it is not the only dialogue in which theories normally expounded by Plato/Socrates are broken down through dialectic. Instead of arriving at answers, the method was used to break down the theories we hold, to go &quot;beyond&quot; the axioms and postulates we take for granted. Therefore, myth and the Socratic method are not meant by Plato to be incompatible; they have different purposes, and are often described as the &quot;left hand&quot; and &quot;right hand&quot; paths to good and wisdom.

===Socratic Circles===

A '''Socratic Circle''' (also known as a '''Socratic Seminar''') is a pedagogical approach based on the Socratic method and uses a [[dialogic]] approach to understand information in a text. Its systematic procedure is used to examine a text through questions and answers founded on the beliefs that all new knowledge is connected to prior knowledge, that all thinking comes from asking questions, and that asking one question should lead to asking further questions.&lt;ref name=Copeland&gt;{{cite book|last=Copeland|first=Matt|title=Socratic Circles: Fostering Critical and Creative Thinking in Middle and High School|year=2010|publisher=Stenhouse|location=Portland, ME}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Socratic Circle is not a debate. The goal of this activity is to have participants work together to construct meaning and arrive at an answer, not for one student or one group to “win the argument”.&lt;ref name=Litunes&gt;{{cite web|title=The Socratic Circle|url=http://www.corndancer.com/tunes/tunes_print/soccirc.pdf|access-date=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach is based on the belief that participants seek and gain deeper understanding of concepts in the text through thoughtful dialogue rather than memorizing information that has been provided for them.&lt;ref name=Litunes /&gt; While Socratic Circles can differ in structure, and even in name, they typically involve the following components: a passage of text that students must read beforehand and two concentric circles of students: an outer circle and an inner circle. The inner circle focuses on exploring and analysing the text through the act of questioning and answering. During this phase, the outer circle remains silent. Students in the outer circle are much like scientific observers watching and listening to the conversation of the inner circle. When the text has been fully discussed and the inner circle is finished talking, the outer circle provides feedback on the dialogue that took place. This process alternates with the inner circle students going to the outer circle for the next meeting and vice versa. The length of this process varies depending on the text used for the discussion. The teacher may decide to alternate groups within one meeting, or they may alternate at each separate meeting.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt;&lt;ref name=Furman&gt;{{cite web|title=Furman: Socratic Seminar|url=http://furman.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/7/6/5176248/socratic_seminar_-_guidance_from_avid.pdf|access-date=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant difference between this activity and most typical classroom activities involves the role of the teacher. In Socratic Circles the students lead the discussion and questioning. The teacher's role is to ensure the discussion advances regardless of the particular direction the discussion takes.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt;&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;

====Various approaches to Socratic Circles====

Teachers use Socratic Circles in different ways. The structure it takes may look different in each classroom. While this is not an exhaustive list, teachers may use one of the following structures to administer Socratic Seminar:

# '''Inner/outer circle or fishbowl''': Students need to be arranged in inner and outer circles. The inner circle engages in discussion about the text. The outer circle observes the inner circle, while taking notes. The outer circle shares their [[observations]] and questions the inner circle with guidance from the teacher/facilitator. Students use constructive [[criticism]] as opposed to making judgements. The students on the outside keep track of topics they would like to discuss as part of the debrief. Participants of the outer circle can use an observation checklist or notes form to monitor the participants in the inner circle. These tools will provide structure for listening and give the outside members specific details to discuss later in the seminar.&lt;ref name=Copeland/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt; The teacher may also sit in the circle but at the same height as the students.&lt;ref name=Chowning&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ting Chowning|first=Jeanne|title=Socratic Seminars in Science Class|journal=[[The Science Teacher]] | publisher = [[National Science Teachers Association]]|date=October 2009|volume=76|issue=7|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Triad''': Students are arranged so that each participant (called a “pilot”) in the inner circle has two “co-pilots” sitting behind them on either side. Pilots are the speakers because they are in the inner circle; co-pilots are in the outer circle and only speak during consultation. The seminar proceeds as any other seminar. At a point in the seminar, the [[facilitator]] pauses the discussion and instructs the triad to talk to each other. Conversation will be about topics that need more in-depth discussion or a question posed by the leader. Sometimes triads will be asked by the facilitator to come up with a new question. Any time during a triad conversation, group members can switch seats and one of the co-pilots can sit in the pilot's seat. Only during that time is the switching of seats allowed. This structure allows for students to speak, who may not yet have the confidence to speak in the large group. This type of seminar involves all students instead of just the students in the inner and outer circles.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;
# '''Simultaneous seminars''': Students are arranged in multiple small groups and placed as far as possible from each other. Following the guidelines of the Socratic Seminar, students engage in small group discussions. Simultaneous seminars are typically done with experienced students who need little guidance and can engage in a discussion without assistance from a teacher/facilitator. According to the literature, this type of seminar is beneficial for teachers who want students to explore a variety of texts around a main issue or topic. Each small group may have a different text to read/view and discuss. A larger Socratic Seminar can then occur as a discussion about how each text corresponds with one another. Simultaneous Seminars can also be used for a particularly difficult text. Students can work through different issues and key passages from the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gose|first=Michael|title=When Socratic Dialogue is Flagging: Questions and Strategies for Engaging Students|journal=College Teaching|date=January 2009|volume=57|issue=1|page=46|doi=10.3200/CTCH.57.1.45-50|s2cid=144482413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No matter what structure the teacher employs, the basic premise of the seminar/circles is to turn partial control and direction of the classroom over to the students. The seminars encourage students to work together, creating meaning from the text and to stay away from trying to find a correct interpretation. The emphasis is on critical and creative thinking.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt;

;Socratic Circle texts

A Socratic Circle text is a tangible document that creates a thought-provoking discussion.&lt;ref name=NPC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Paideia Seminar: active thinking through dialogue centre. 3.4 Planning step 3: Select text|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/paideia/6901|access-date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The text ought to be appropriate for the participants' current level of intellectual and social development.&lt;ref name=Chorzempa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chorzempa|first=Barbara|author2=Lapidus, Laurie |title=To Find Yourself, Think For Yourself|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children|date=January 2009|volume=41|issue=3|pages=54–59|doi=10.1177/004005990904100306|s2cid=146880761}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides the anchor for dialogue whereby the [[facilitator]] can bring the participants back to the text if they begin to digress. Furthermore, the seminar text enables the participants to create a level playing field – ensuring that the dialogical tone within the classroom remains consistent and pure to the subject or topic at hand.&lt;ref name=NPC /&gt; Some practitioners argue that &quot;texts&quot; do not have to be confined to printed texts, but can include artifacts such as objects, physical spaces, and the like.

'''Pertinent elements of an effective Socratic text'''

Socratic seminar texts are able to challenge participants’ thinking skills by having these characteristics:

#Ideas and values
#Complexity and challenge
#Relevance to participants' curriculum
#[[Ambiguity]]

1. '''Ideas and values'''

The text must introduce ideas and values that are complex and difficult to summarize.&lt;ref name=NPC /&gt; Powerful discussions arise from personal connections to abstract ideas and from implications to personal values.

2. '''Complexity and challenge'''

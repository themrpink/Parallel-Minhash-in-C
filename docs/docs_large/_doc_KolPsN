Founded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in the 5th century and the capital of the [[provinces of France|province]] of [[Languedoc]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and [[early modern period]] (provinces were abolished during the [[French Revolution]]), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of [[Occitania]] (Southern France). It is now the capital of the [[Occitanie]] [[Région in France|region]], the second largest region in [[Metropolitan France]].

Toulouse counts three [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s: the [[Canal du Midi]] (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the [[Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse|Basilica of St. Sernin]], the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://europeupclose.com/article/toulouses-saint-sernin-largest-romanesque-church-in-europe/ Toulouse's Saint Sernin, Largest Romanesque Church in Europe] ''Europe Close''&lt;/ref&gt;, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital Hôtel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the [[World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France|Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route]]. The city's unique architecture made of pinkish [[terracotta]] bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname ''{{lang|fr|La Ville [[Rose (color)|Rose]]}}'' (&quot;The Pink City&quot;).{{cn|date=June 2020}}

==Geography==
Toulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.

===Hydrography===
The city is traversed by the [[Canal de Brienne]], the [[Canal du Midi]] and the rivers [[Garonne]], [[Touch River|Touch]] and [[Hers-Mort]].

===Climate===
Toulouse has a temperate [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified as a [[Mediterranean climate]] zone.

==History==
{{Main|History of Toulouse|Timeline of Toulouse}}
[[File:Amphitheatre-Toulouse 2.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Vomitorium]] at the Roman amphitheatre in Toulouse]]

===Early history===
The Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the [[European Iron Age|Iron Age]].
The historical name of the city, ''Tolosa'' (Τολῶσσα in [[Greek language|Greek]], and of its inhabitants, the ''Tolosates'', first recorded in the 2nd century BC), it is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] or [[Iberian language|Iberian]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Dauzat]] et [[Charles Rostaing]], ''Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France'', 2nd ed., Librairie Guénégaud 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; but it has also been connected to the name of the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] [[Volcae Tectosages]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le Nom de Toulouse'' de Pierre Moret, 1996, Université Toulouse le Mirail – Toulouse II, p. 11; ''Histoire de Toulouse'', 1974, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] military outpost.
After the conquest of [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], it was developed as a Roman city in [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the [[Francia|Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]] in 507 ([[Battle of Vouillé]]).
From that time, Toulouse was the capital of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] within the Frankish realm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mAgDwx4pS0QC&amp;pg=PA59 The Capetians: Kings of France 987-1328, p. 59, Jim Bradbury,2007]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In 721, [[Odo the Great|Duke Odo]] of [[Aquitaine]] defeated an invading [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] army at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with [[Charles Martel]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Tours]], also called the Battle of Poitiers).&lt;ref&gt;https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k415420b/f39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Frankish conquest of [[Septimania]] followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent [[County of Toulouse]] emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The [[Battle of Toulouse (844)|Battle of Toulouse of 844]], pitting [[Charles the Bald]] against [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], was key in the Carolingian Civil War.

===County of Toulouse===
{{further|County of Toulouse}}
[[File:Raymond IV of Toulouse.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]] was a leader of the [[First Crusade]]]]
The town became the capital of the [[County of Toulouse]] during the [[Carolingian era]].

In 1096, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the [[First Crusade]], of which he was one of the main leaders.

In the 12th century the notables of the city took advantage of a weakening of the county power to obtain for their city a great autonomy, they created a municipal body of consuls (called [[capitoul|capitouls]] in Toulouse) to lead the city.

At the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the [[Albigensian Crusade|military crusade]], such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the [[Southern French Gothic]].

In 1215, the [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.

In the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris of 1229]], Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless and so after Joan's death, the county fell to the [[Crown of France]] by inheritance.

Also in 1229, [[University of Toulouse]] was established after the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of ''frères prêcheurs'', were started. They found home in [[Church of the Jacobins|''Les Jacobins'']]. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Kingdom of France===
In 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the [[kingdom of France]] and declared a &quot;[[Crown lands of France#Reign of Philip III|royal city]]&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1323 the [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] was created in Toulouse to preserve the [[Lyric poetry|lyric art]] of the [[troubadour]]s by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of [[Occitania|Occitan]] literary culture for the next hundred years. The [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated [[Leys d'amor|treatise]] on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the [[Floral Games]] (''Académie des Jeux Floraux''), still active today, by king Louis XIV.

The 14th century brought a [[pogrom]] against Toulouse's Jewish population by [[crusades|Crusaders]] in 1320,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/is-it-time-for-the-jews-to-leave-europe/386279/.&quot; | title=Goldberg, Jeffrey. &quot;Is it Time for the Jews to Leave Europe?&quot; The Atlantic. April 2015. |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Black Death]] in 1348, then the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Biraben, Jean-Noël. ''La Population de Toulouse au XIVe et au XVe siècles [Pierre Wolff, Les Estimes toulousaines du XIVe et XVe siècles]''. Journal des savants, 1964, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation improved in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brumont, Francis. ''La commercialisation du pastel toulousain (1350–1600)''. Privat presse, 1994, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] established the second [[Parliament of Toulouse|parliament]] of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of [[Bordeaux wine]] with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of [[Isatis tinctoria|pastel]], a blue dye made from woad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terredepastel.com/le-pastel// |title=terredepastel.com |publisher=terredepastel.com |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortune generated by this international trade was at the origin of several of Toulouse's superb Renaissance mansions.
[[File:Capitole de Toulouse.jpg|thumb|The [[Capitole de Toulouse]], Toulouse's city hall, is an example of the 18th-century architectural projects in the city.]]

===French Empire===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
The [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)]] was one of the final battles of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], four days after [[Napoleon]]'s surrender of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] to the nations of the [[Sixth Coalition]]. Toulouse, the regional capital, proved stoutly defended by [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]].

The population of the city proper (French: ''[[Commune of France|commune]]'') was 479,553 at the January 2017 census, with 1,360,829 inhabitants in the [[Metropolitan Area (France)|metropolitan area]] (within the 2010 borders of the metropolitan area), up from 1,187,686 at the January 2007 census (within the same 2010 borders of the metropolitan area).&lt;ref name=&quot;pop_UU&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pop_AU&quot; /&gt; Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.4% per year between 2007 and 2017, the highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, although it is slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1999 and 2007 censuses.

Toulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]], and the fourth-largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.

Fueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of +1.49% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with +0.37% for [[metropolitan France]]), and a record +1.87% a year in the early 2000s (+0.68% for metropolitan France), which is the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, means the Toulouse metropolitan area overtook Lille as the fourth-largest metropolitan area of France at the 2006 census.

A local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Irish |first=John |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/20/us-france-shootings-toulouse-idUSBRE82J17C20120320 |title=Killings sour good life for high-flying Toulouse |publisher=Reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==

===Toulouse Métropole===

{{Main|Toulouse Métropole}}
The Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (''Communauté d'agglomération du Grand Toulouse'') was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent ''communes'', covering an area of {{convert|380|km²|0|abbr=on}}, totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communauté urbaine). This has become a [[métropole]] in 2015, spanning 37 communes.&lt;ref name=decret&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000029497463|title=Décret n° 2014-1078 du 22 septembre 2014 portant création de la métropole dénommée « Toulouse Métropole » &amp;#124; Legifrance|accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major political figures in Toulouse was [[Dominique Baudis]], the [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in [[Lebanon]], 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father [[Pierre Baudis]] in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)

Baudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Zénith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cité de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.

To deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the [[Rapid transit|underground]] was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourlafrance.com/france-city/toulouse-france/toulouse-politics.htm |title=Toulouse politics information |publisher=Bonjourlafrance.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the [[French Revolution]]; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], then [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] mayor of [[Lourdes]] as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (''[[Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel]]'') in Paris, the French equivalent of the American [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].

Philippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF (factory)|AZF]] plant in late 2001.

In March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate [[Pierre Cohen]].

At the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.

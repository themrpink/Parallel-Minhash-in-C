The population of Tunisia is primarily of [[Berbers|Berber]] ancestral origin (&gt;60%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhatia&quot;/&gt; Whilst the Ottoman influence has been particularly significant in forming the [[Turks in Tunisia|Turco-Tunisian]] community, other peoples have also migrated to Tunisia during different periods of time, including Sub-Saharan Africans, [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Phoenicians]] ([[Punic]]s), [[Jews]], and French settlers.

From the late 19th century to after World War II, Tunisia was home to large populations of [[French people|French]] and [[Italian Tunisians|Italians]] (255,000 [[European Tunisians|Europeans]] in 1956),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Maddison|title=Contours of the World Economy 1–2030 AD:Essays in Macro-Economic History: Essays in Macro-Economic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EeWy7a6nAHcC&amp;pg=PA214|access-date=26 January 2013|date=20 September 2007|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-922721-1|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; although nearly all of them, along with the Jewish population, left after Tunisia became independent. The [[history of the Jews in Tunisia]] goes back some 2,000 years. In 1948 the Jewish population was an estimated 105,000, but by 2013 only about 900 remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/tunisjews.html |title=The Jews of Tunisia |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first people known to history in what is now Tunisia were the [[Berber people|Berber]]s. Numerous civilizations and peoples have invaded, migrated to, or have been assimilated into the population over the millennia, with influences of population from [[Phoenicians]]/[[Carthaginians]], [[Roman Republic|Roman]]s, [[Vandal]]s, [[Arabs]], [[Spaniard]]s, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] and [[Janissaries]], and [[French people|French]]. There was a continuing inflow of nomadic [[Banu Hilal|Arab tribes]] from [[Arabia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stearns&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Stearns | first1 = Peter N. | last2 = Leonard Langer | first2 = William | title = The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, Chronologically Arranged | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] | year = 2001 | edition = 6 | pages = 129–131 | isbn = 978-0-395-65237-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Reconquista]] and expulsion of non-Christians and [[Morisco]]s from Spain, many Spanish [[Muslims]] and Jews also arrived. According to Matthew Carr, &quot;As many as eighty thousand Moriscos settled in Tunisia, most of them in and around the capital, Tunis, which still contains a quarter known as Zuqaq al-Andalus, or Andalusia Alley.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Carr | first = Matthew | title = Blood and faith: the purging of Muslim Spain | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=netlOtzI6R8C&amp;pg=PA290 | publisher = The New Press | year = 2009 | page = 290 | isbn = 978-1-59558-361-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
While most modern day Tunisians identify as [[Arab]]s {{citation needed|date=September 2020}}, Tunisian ancestry is mainly derived from native [[Berbers|Berber]] groups, with substantial [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]]/[[Punic]], [[Arab]] and [[Western Europe#Population|Western European]] input. Tunisians are also descended, to a much lesser extent, from other African, Middle Eastern and/or European peoples. In sum, a little less than 20 percent of paternal haplogroups ([[Y-chromosome]] lineage) are from present day [[Levant]], [[Arabia]], [[Europe]] or [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/AJHG_2004_v74_p1023-1034.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414212524/http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/AJHG_2004_v74_p1023-1034.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cruciani|first=Fulvio|date=May 2004|title=Phylogeographic Analysis of Haplogroup E3b (E-M215) Y Chromosomes Reveals Multiple Migratory Events Within and Out Of Africa|url=http://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S0002-9297(07)64365-1|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=74| issue = 5|pages=1014–1022|doi=10.1086/386294|pmid=15042509|access-date=24 May 2016|display-authors=etal|pmc=1181964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;In fact, the Tunisian genetic distances to European samples are smaller than those to North African groups. (...) This could be explained by the history of the Tunisian population, reflecting the influence of the ancient Punic settlers of [[Carthage]] followed, among others, by Roman, Byzantine, Arab and French occupations, according to historical records. Notwithstanding, other explanations cannot be discarded, such as the relative heterogeneity within current Tunisian populations, and/or the limited sub-Saharan genetic influence in this region as compared with other North African areas, without excluding the possibility of the [[genetic drift]], whose effect might be particularly amplified on the X chromosome.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v15/n5/abs/5201797a.html The X chromosome Alu insertions as a tool for human population genetics: data from European and African human groups], Athanasiadis et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomas C, Sanchez JJ, Barbaro A |title=X-chromosome SNP analyses in 11 human Mediterranean populations show a high overall genetic homogeneity except in North-west Africans (Moroccans) |journal=BMC Evol.

However, later research has suggested instead that Tunisians exhibit a mostly indigenous North African ancestral component similar to other Northwest African populations; characterized by a high amount of native Northwest African genes, but with higher Middle Eastern input than in Algeria or Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/4137738|title=Mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome microstructure in Tunisia|journal=Journal of Human Genetics|volume=56|issue=10|pages=734–741|last1=Benammar-Elgaaïed|first1=Amel|last2=Larruga|first2=José M.|last3=Cabrera|first3=Vicente M.|last4=Mahmoudi|first4=Hejer Abdallah El|last5=González|first5=Ana M.|last6=Khodjet-El-Khil|first6=Houssein|last7=Fregel|first7=Rosa|last8=Ennafaa|first8=Hajer|year=2011|doi=10.1038/jhg.2011.92|pmid=21833004|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literacy rate among the Tunisian population increased greatly after its independence from France. According to the 1996 census data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = As , Walters Keith | year = 2003 | title = Fergie's prescience: the changing nature of diglossia in Tunisia | journal = International Journal of the Society of Language | volume = 163 | pages = 85–87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the literacy rate of the last generation of Tunisian men educated under the French rule (those born 1945–49) was less than 65%. For the first generation educated after independence (born 1950–1954), literacy in Arabic among males had increased to nearly 80%. (Sixty-two percent were also literate in French and 15 percent literate in English). Among the youngest generation included in the census (those born 1980–1984), 96.6% were literate in Arabic.

Among Tunisian women, the increase in literacy was even greater. The literacy rate among the last generation of women educated under the French was less than 30%. In the first generation educated after independence, this increased to just over 40%. For the youngest generation of women cited (born 1980–1984), literacy in Arabic had increased to slightly over 90%; over 70% of women were also literate in French.&lt;ref&gt;The children born in the early 1980s had not yet begun English instruction by the time of the 1996 census, so no literacy rate in English is given. However, the children born between 1970–74 (who had completed their education) had a literacy in English of 20%. It's highly likely that the younger generation's literacy in English was even higher at the conclusion of their schooling. Walters 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Artillerie beylicale.jpg|thumb|Tunisian artillery and gunners, circa 1900]]

The modern Tunisian army was formed in 1831 by [[Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud]]. During the period of the [[French Protectorate of Tunisia|French Protectorate]] (1881–1956) Tunisians were recruited in significant numbers into the [[French Army]], serving as [[tirailleurs]] (infantry) and [[spahis]] (cavalry). These units saw active service in Europe during both World Wars, as well as in [[Indo-China]] prior to 1954. The only exclusively Tunisian military force permitted under French rule was the [[Beylical Guard]].&lt;ref name=KeeganT&gt;page 710 &quot;World Armies&quot;, John Keegan, {{ISBN|0-333-17236-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Following independence ===
On June 30, 1956, the Tunisian army was officially founded by decree,&lt;ref name=&quot;decret56&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cnudst.rnrt.tn/jortsrc/1956/1956f/jo05256.pdf|format=PDF|language=French|title=Décret du 30 join 1956 instituant l'armée tunisienne|journal=Journal official tunisien|date=29–30 June 1956|page=884|issue=52|access-date=26 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227155443/http://www.cnudst.rnrt.tn/jortsrc/1956/1956f/jo05256.pdf|archive-date=27 December 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of a combined-arms regiment.

Intakes of conscripts for military service, made mandatory in January 1957, plus the recall of reservists allowed the army to grow to twelve battalions numbering 20,000 men by 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kefi&quot;/&gt; Sixty per cent of those troops were deployed for border monitoring and defense duties.

Tunisian units first saw action in 1958 after French intrusions into the south in pursuit of [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)]] fighters. In 1960 Tunisian troops served with the United National Peacekeeping Force in the Congo. 1,020 troops from the Tunisian Armed Forces were amongst the first UN troops to arrive in the Congo, by 20 July 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N60/171/85/PDF/N6017185.pdf?OpenElement|title=FIRST REPORT BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION S/4387 CF 14 JULY 1960 (S/4389)|last=United Nations (Official Documents System)|website=documents-dds-ny.un.org|date=18 July 1960|access-date=2016-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230155833/https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N60/171/85/PDF/N6017185.pdf?OpenElement|archive-date=30 December 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 [[Bizerte crisis|clashes]] occurred with French forces based at [[Bizerte]]. More than 600 men fell in battle against the French forces. The French evacuated the base after subsequent negotiations with the Tunisian Government.

The Tunisian Navy, founded in 1958, received its first ship in the fall of 1959.  The [[Tunisian Air Force|Air Force]] acquired its first combat aircraft in 1960 . While the Tunisian armed forces obtain equipment from several sources, the [[United States]] remains the largest single supplier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kefi&quot;/&gt; Officer and specialist training for Tunisian personnel was formerly undertaken in French and American military academies. Tunisian trainees are now gradually being assigned to newly established military schools within the country.
 
The January 10, 1957, a law prohibits any military officer to be a member of a group or a [[political party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kefi&quot;/&gt; However, after 7 November 1987 when the former [[Prime Minister of Tunisia|Prime Minister]], General [[Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali]] took power senior officers such as [[Abdelhamid Escheikh]] and [[Mustapha Bouaziz]] took up ministerial appointments.

On 30 April 2002, at around 18.15, the direction of the Army - Brigadier General Abdelaziz Skik who led the Tunisian contingent to [[Cambodia]], two colonels - majors, three colonels, four majors, two lieutenants and a sergeant-major - disappeared in a helicopter crash near the town of [[Medjez el-Bab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}}[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN13053larmeliuedn0 Abdelaziz Barrouhi, &quot;The army in mourning&quot;], &quot;[[Jeune Afrique]]&quot;, May 13, 2002  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130045500/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN13053larmeliuedn0 |date=30 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunisia has contributed military forces to [[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions, including an army company to the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR) during the [[Rwandan genocide]]. In his book ''Shake Hands with the Devil'', Canadian force commander [[Roméo Dallaire]] gave the Tunisian soldiers high credit for their skills and effort in the conflict and referred to them as his &quot;ace in the hole&quot;.

During the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], Tunisian forces, mostly border guards, saw some limited action when fighting between Libyan rebels and loyalist soldiers spilled over the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amara |first=Tarek |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE73S00320110429?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel |title=Pro-Gaddafi forces clash with Tunisian military |work=Reuters |date=2011-04-29 |accessdate=2013-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235415/http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE73S00320110429?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The military and politics===
The Library of Congress Country Study says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His exclusive power to promote military officers has been among the strongest components of Bourguiba's control over the armed forces. From independence, high-ranking officers—general staff and senior commanders in particular—have been carefully selected for their party loyalty more than for their professional experience and competence. This began in the late 1950s when the president dismissed those officers who had trained in the Middle East and who might therefore have been expected to sympathize with the militant Pan-Arab policies of Egypt's Nasser. The hand-picked senior officers, in turn, carefully screened all officers who were considered for positions of authority in line units to ensure that antiregime elements did not pose potential threats at any level of the military establishment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a result of these promotion policies, the Tunisian officer corps took on a very homogeneous character that only began to break down in the 1970s. Senior officers have been generally representative of Tunisia's economically and politically dominant families from the north, the coastal areas, and the major cities. Although military men have been kept from operating major business ventures or holding political office while in uniform, it has been common for family members to be prominent in business or in the Destourian political movement. Generally Western and Francophile in outlook, tied by kinship to the country's upper socioeconomic stratum, and personally familiar with leading figures in the PSD, high-ranking Tunisian officers must be classed as part of the national elite.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==General Staff==
In accordance with Article 44 of the constitution, the supreme commander of the armed forces is the [[President of Tunisia|President of the Republic of Tunisia]].

In December 2010, the staff is composed as follows: Chief of Staff of the Army corps is the General Rashid Ammar, one of the Air Force is Brigadier General Taieb Lajimi and that the navy is Rear Admiral Mohamed Khamassi. In April 2011, Ammar became chief of staff inter-armed.

The Inspector General of the armed forces is Rear Admiral Tarek Faouzi Larbi, the Director of Military Engineering is Brigadier General Mohammed Hedi Abdelkafi and the director of military security Brigadier General Ahmed Chabir.

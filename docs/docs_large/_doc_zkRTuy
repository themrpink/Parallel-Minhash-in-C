'''2001''' – LINX amended its corporate structure to make the post of chairman non-executive and appointed its first chief executive officer, John Souter, previously UK managing director of German-owned Varetis Communications.

'''2002''' – LINX was the first exchange to introduce 10G Ethernet operation, using equipment from Foundry Networks – in fact, the second of their worldwide customers to deploy their technology.

'''2003''' – This year saw the launch of the 'LINX from Anywhere' service, a facility that permits smaller ISPs to piggyback on the networks of existing members to obtain a secure, virtual presence on the LINX exchange without incurring the manpower and rackspace costs of having their own installation in London.

'''2004''' – LINX considerably expanded its footprint, with four new points of presence (PoPs) – all in the Docklands area of London.

'''2005''' – LINX members vote to make public affairs one of the company's &quot;core functions&quot;, placing it on an equal footing with peering and interconnection.

'''2006''' – LINX membership reached 200.

'''2008''' – LINX expanded again opening three new PoPs, this time adding considerably to the geographical diversity by doing so in the City of London, North Acton and Slough. It also heralded new relationships with data centre operators, with the addition of Interxion and Equinix (to the pre-existing ones of Telehouse and Telecity).

'''2011''' – The LINX primary LAN was redesigned to a VPLS-based infrastructure with a new vendor, Juniper Networks.

'''2012''' – The ConneXions reseller programme launched. Also this year LINX became the first Internet exchange in the world to install a Juniper PTX5000 in a live network and the exchange opened its first site outside London in Manchester (IXManchester).

'''2013''' – In the Autumn two further local exchanges were launched. IXScotland in Edinburgh and LINX NoVA in North Virginia, USA, the exchange's first sites outside England.

'''2014''' – In the Autumn a local exchange was launched, IXCardiff in [[Wales]].

'''2017''' – Following the passage of the [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016|Investigatory Powers Act]], a new constitution was proposed which would ban directors from reporting the installation of surveillance equipment to members. This caused dissension among members, many of which are non-UK based ISPs operating from countries where mass surveillance is not legal.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=UK Snoopers' Charter gagging order drafted for London Internet Exchange directors|last=Campbell|first=Duncan|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/17/linx_snoopers_charger_gagging_order/|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=The Register|date=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of the constitutional change was disputed on the official LINX website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LINX response to Article in The Register|url=https://www.linx.net/communications/press-releases/linx-response-to-article-in-the-register|access-date=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voting on the constitutional revision took place during a hastily called Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 21 February; although a majority supported the change the number attending was too small for the motion to be carried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London Internet Exchange members vote no to constitution tweak|last=Campbell|first=Duncan|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/22/linx_members_vote_to_block/|accessdate=22 February 2017|work=The Register|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
In London LINX operates two physically separate networks or [[network switch|switching platforms]] on different [[Computer architecture|architecture]]s using equipment from different manufacturers ([[Extreme Networks]] and [[Juniper Networks]]). These networks are deployed over ten locations, each connected by multiple [[100 Gigabit Ethernet]] or [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]] connections over [[Optical fiber|fibre]] networks.&lt;ref name=LINX&gt;{{cite web|title=LINX Network Topology|url=https://www.linx.net/tech-info-help/network-topology|publisher=London Internet Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2018 sees the deployment of a world first, disaggregated approach to network architecture, as the LINX Engineering team restructure the secondary LAN in London, LON2, using software and hardware from two different suppliers.

16 London locations within the data centre facilities listed:

*[[Telehouse North]]
*Telehouse North 2
*[[Telehouse East]]
*[[Telehouse West]]
*[[TelecityGroup|Equinix Harbour Exchange]] (ex. TeleCity)
* Digital Realty, Bonnington House, Millharbour (ex. TeleCity)
*[[TelecityGroup|Digital Realty, Sovereign House]], Marsh Wall (ex. TeleCity)
* Equinix Powergate, Acton
*[[Equinix]], Slough
*[[Interxion]] London City
*Virtus, Hayes (Transmission PoP)
*Colt Data Centre, London West (Transmission PoP)

Connecting is also possible from remote locations via the 'LINX from Anywhere' scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LINX Anywhere|url=https://linx.net/join/linxanywhere.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; via a range of layer 2 service/MPLS carriers.

Redundancy of the network is managed using rapid-failover protection mechanisms such a VPLS service over an MPLS core (MPLS/VPLS) from Juniper and Extreme's [[Ethernet Automatic Protection System]] (EAPS). These restore connectivity within tenths of a second in the event of the loss of a network segment.

In addition to the main peering infrastructure, LINX provides managed private interconnections (via [[Single-mode optical fiber|Single Mode Fibre]]) between LINX members, and works with a number of fibre carriers to provide rapid connection between LINX members for private circuits. These PI circuits may be used for any purpose but are mainly intended for Private Peering arrangements between members. Private Peering is sometimes more appropriate for managing large flows of traffic between ISPs and/or Content Providers.

Telehouse hosts the vast majority of internet peering traffic from LINX.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Public affairs==
One of LINX's core functions is to represent its members in matters of public policy. LINX's Public Affairs department works to obtain advance warning of public policy developments that could affect LINX members, to inform members about important policy developments at a time when it is still possible to influence them, and to educate, inform and influence regulators and legislators.

At the UK level, LINX liaises directly with policymakers on matters such as content regulation, telecoms regulation, privacy and data protection, e-mail spam, online fraud/phishing, law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and any other topics that affect LINX members.

At the European level, LINX is an active member of [[EuroISPA]] and works with EuroISPA's other national associations to influence European policy.

LINX also works actively with partner organisations such as the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] (IWF) and the [[Internet Society]] (ISOC). LINX was instrumental in the creation of the Internet Watch Foundation, the UK hotline for reporting and removing [[child sexual abuse material]] from the Internet, and continues to advise the IWF as a member of its Funding Council.

As a mutual, membership-based organisation, all of LINX's public affairs activity is informed and guided by extensive and ongoing consultation with LINX members.

==Local exchanges==

===LINX Manchester===
Launched in April 2012 IXManchester, now known as LINX Manchester was initially a single-site platform based on a stand-alone Brocade BigIron RX-16 switch, repurposed from the primary LAN in London. A new design extends the network to two new sites – M247's IceColo &amp; Joule House and brings in completely new hardware from Extreme Networks.

The new network will be configured as an EAPS protected ring, topology currently used for the secondary LINX LAN in London. All sites will use a Summit X670v switch, capable of connecting 48x10 Gb member ports. Telecity Williams will also have a smaller Summit X460 switch for terminating slower ports.

The links between sites will be provisioned on a dark fibre provided by NTL and lit by LINX with the use of SFP+ DWDM transceivers and passive DWDM MUX units. Initial ISL capacity will be configured at 20 Gbit/s but easily upgradeable to 80 Gbit/s if required.

===LINX Scotland===
Located in Pulsant's South Gyle data centre in Edinburgh (formerly Scolocate), IXScotland, now known as LINX Scotland, was officially launched in November 2013. The site will use the latest hardware from Extreme Networks enabling all the advanced features expected from a modern exchange.

===LINX Cardiff===
Located in BT's Stadium House data centre in Cardiff. IXCardiff, now known as LINX Cardiff was officially launched on 15 October 2014 in an effort to decentralise UK internet traffic.

As of July 2018, LINX Cardiff has a typical peak of 0.9976 Gbit/s of network traffic with a maximum peak of 1.03 Gbit/s as of 1 December 2017.

===LINX NoVA===
Following discussions with the US network community, and its own members, LINX decided to launch an open peering exchange in North America in late 2013. Formally to be known as LINX NoVA, the exchange will be closely aligned with, and endorsed by, the newly formed [[Open-IX]], using systems and processes that have proved successful in Europe and the wider world for nearly 20 years.

Based in the North Virginia/Washington DC area LINX NoVA initially spanned three data centres – EvoSwitch in Manassas, Digital Realty in Ashburn and Coresite in Reston – and will be connected using dark fibre lit by LINX. An agreement for a fourth colo site, also in Ashburn, is expected shortly.

The LINX NoVA exchange will useMX960 router equipment from Juniper Networks capable of delivering 100G member ports from launch with the three PoPs all connected by diverse dark fibre lit by LINX.

LINX NoVA will be developed in the same way as the LINX primary LAN in London (VPLS, separated core and edge, etc.) but as a stand-alone site not requiring a connection to the LANs operated in the London, UK.

==Other activities==
LINX also carries on a number of non-core activities (NCAPs) from time to time, for example the LINX Accredited Internet Technician (LAIT) training programme.

Other services provided include a time service using [[atomic clock]]s, as well as hosting for other &quot;Good of the Internet&quot; services including various Internet statistics projects, numerous [[Name server|secondary name servers]] for various [[ccTLD]] domains, and instances of the F, K and I [[root nameserver]]s.

Latest news for 2018/19 sees LINX launch an IXP partner relationship with Japan IX allowing customers to connect to LINX in London and also LINX and Saudi Telecom Company (STC), on December 7, 2018 marked the start of '''JED-IX driven by LINX''', an Internet exchange in Jeddah (JED-IX), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).

==See also==
Some other Internet exchange points in London:
* [[London Internet Providers Exchange]] (LIPEX)
* [[LoNAP|London Network Access Point]] (LONAP)
* [[Packet Exchange]] (Formerly XchangePoint)

LINX hosts a number of meetings where network operators can exchange information: see [[Internet network operators' group]] for a list of other organisations holding similar meetings.

'''[[Cornelii Cinnae|Cinna]]''' was a ''[[cognomen]]'' that distinguished a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] branch of the ''[[gens]] [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelia]]'', particularly in the late [[Roman Republic]].

Prominent members of this family include:
*[[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]], [[consul]] four consecutive times 87–84 BC, a [[populares|popularist]] leader allied with [[Gaius Marius]] against [[Sulla]], and at the time of his death the father-in-law of [[Julius Caesar]].
*[[Cornelia (wife of Caesar)|Cornelia Cinna]], the wife of Julius Caesar,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911||wstitle=Cinna (family)|volume=6|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mother of his only legitimate child.
* [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna (suffect consul)]], the son of Lucius Cornelius Cinna and a [[praetor]]; he was a brother-in-law of Julius Caesar and mistakenly believed to have been a part of the assassination plot
*[[Helvius Cinna]], a poet murdered for having the same name as Caesar's brother-in-law during the riots following Caesar's death.
*[[Gnaeus Cornelius Cinna Magnus]], a conspirator against [[Augustus Caesar]] in AD 4, and the subject of [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]'s tragedy ''[[Cinna (play)|Cinna]]''

Vasco da Gama's body was first buried at [[St. Francis Church, Cochin|St. Francis Church]], which was located at [[Fort Kochi]] in the city of [[Kochi (India)|Kochi]], but his remains were returned to Portugal in 1539. The body of Vasco da Gama was re-interred in Vidigueira in a casket decorated with gold and jewels.

[[File:Vasco da Gama Jerónimos 2008-1.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Vasco da Gama in the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in Belém, Lisbon]]
The [[Jerónimos Monastery, Lisbon|Monastery of the Hieronymites]], in [[Belém, Lisbon|Belém]], which would become the necropolis of the Portuguese royal dynasty of [[House of Aviz|Aviz]], was erected in the early 1500s near the launch point of Vasco da Gama's first journey, and its construction funded by a tax on the profits of the yearly Portuguese India Armadas.  In 1880, da Gama's remains and those of the poet [[Luís de Camões]] (who celebrated da Gama's first voyage in his 1572 epic poem, ''[[The Lusiad]]''), were moved to new carved tombs in the nave of the monastery's church, only a few meters away from the tombs of the kings [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] and [[John III of Portugal|John III]], whom da Gama had served.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Vasco da Gama - 1838.png|thumb|Portrait of Vasco da Gama by [[António Manuel da Fonseca]] (1838)]]

Vasco da Gama is one of the most famous and celebrated explorers from the [[Age of Discovery]]. As much as anyone after [[Henry the Navigator]], he was responsible for Portugal's success as an early colonising power. Beside the fact of the first voyage itself, it was his astute mix of politics and war on the other side of the world that placed Portugal in a prominent position in [[Indian Ocean trade]]. Following da Gama's initial voyage, the Portuguese crown realized that securing outposts on the eastern coast of Africa would prove vital to maintaining national trade routes to the Far East.

However, his fame is tempered by such incidents and attitudes as displayed in the notorious Pilgrim Ship Incident previously discussed.

The Portuguese [[national epic]], the ''[[Lusíadas]]'' of [[Luís de Camões|Luís Vaz de Camões]], largely concerns Vasco da Gama's voyages.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11198/ |title = The Lusiads |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1800–1882 |accessdate = 31 August 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1865 [[grand opera]] ''[[L'Africaine]]: Opéra en Cinq Actes'', composed by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] from a libretto by [[Eugène Scribe]], prominently includes the character of Vasco da Gama. The events depicted, however, are fictitious. Meyerbeer's working title for the opera was ''Vasco da Gama''. A 1989 production of the opera by the [[San Francisco Opera]] featured noted [[tenor]] [[Plácido Domingo]] in the role of da Gama.&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century composer [[Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray]] composed an eponymous 1872 opera based on da Gama's life and exploits at sea.

The port city of [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]] in Goa is named after him, as is the crater [[Vasco da Gama (crater)|Vasco da Gama]] on the [[Moon]]. There are three football clubs in Brazil (including [[Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama]]) and [[Vasco Sports Club]] in Goa that were also named after him. There exists a church in [[Kochi (India)|Kochi]], Kerala called [[Vasco da Gama Church]], and a private residence on the island of [[Saint Helena]]. The suburb of Vasco in Cape Town also honours him.

[[File:50 Escudos célébrant le 500e anniversaire de la naissance de Vasco Da Gama, 1969.jpg|thumb|Portuguese coin from 1969 commemorating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's birth.]]
A few places in Lisbon's [[Parque das Nações]] are named after the explorer, such as the [[Vasco da Gama Bridge]], [[Vasco da Gama Tower]] and the ''Centro Comercial Vasco da Gama'' shopping centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrovascodagama.pt/ |title=Centro Vasco da Gama |publisher=Centrovascodagama.pt |accessdate=29 January 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lisbon Oceanarium|Oceanário]] in the Parque das Nações has a mascot of a cartoon diver with the name of &quot;Vasco&quot;, who is named after the explorer.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Vasco da Gama was the only explorer on the final pool of [[Os Grandes Portugueses]]. Although the final shortlist featured other [[Age of Discovery]] related people, they were not actually explorers nor navigators for any matter.

The [[Portuguese Navy]] has a [[Vasco da Gama class frigate|class of frigates]] named after him. There are three ''Vasco da Gama'' class frigates in total, of which the first one also [[NRP Vasco da Gama (F330)|bears his name]].

South African musician [[Hugh Masekela]] recorded an anti-colonialist song entitled &quot;Colonial Man&quot;, which contains the lyrics &quot;Vasco da Gama was no friend of mine&quot;, and another song entitled &quot;Vasco da Gama (The Sailor Man)&quot;. Both songs were included in his 1976 album ''[[Colonial Man]]''.

Vasco da Gama appears as an antagonist in the Indian film ''[[Urumi (film)|Urumi]]''. The film, directed by Santosh Sivan, depicts a failed assassination attempt on da Gama by an Indian.

In March 2016, archaeologists working off the coast of [[Oman]] identified a shipwreck believed to be that of the ''Esmeralda'' from da Gama's 1502–1503 fleet. The wreck was initially discovered in 1998. Later underwater excavations took place between 2013 and 2015 through a partnership between the Oman Ministry of Heritage and Culture and [[Blue Water Recoveries]] Ltd., a shipwreck recovery company. The vessel was identified through such artifacts as a &quot;Portuguese coin minted for trade with India (one of only two coins of this type known to exist) and stone cannonballs engraved with what appear to be the initials of Vincente Sodré, da Gama's maternal uncle and the commander of the ''Esmeralda''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Romey|first1=Kristin|title=Shipwreck Discovered from Explorer Vasco da Gama's Fleet|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/20160314-oman-shipwreck-explorer-vasco-da-gama-age-of-exploration-india-route/|accessdate=15 March 2016|magazine=National Geographic|date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Puppet Masters''''' is a 1951 [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]], in which American secret agents battle parasitic invaders from outer space. It was originally serialized in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' (September, October, November 1951).

The novel evokes a sense of [[paranoia]] and Heinlein repeatedly makes explicit the analogy between the [[Parasites in fiction|mind-controlling parasites]] and the Communist Russians, echoing the prevailing [[Second Red Scare]] in the United States.

The book takes up the then common theme of sightings of ''[[Flying saucer]]s'', the plot assuming that the &quot;saucers&quot; seen in the 1950s were part of a preliminary [[reconnaissance]] of Earth, carried out by the extraterrestrials in preparation for a full-fledged invasion sixty years later. 

==Setting==
The novel's first scene is set in 2007. Following a nuclear war between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Western Bloc]], which left both sides battered but unbroken, both sides return to a state of [[Cold War]]. Washington, DC and other US cities devastated in nuclear strikes had been completely rebuilt. The Soviet Union and China remain a single bloc dominated by Moscow, and the sharp [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the late 1950s never happened.

Social customs have changed somewhat, in a way typical for Heinlein's fiction (i.e. having become more liberal, such as [[Prenuptial agreement|marriage contracts]] being possible with fixed terms, etc.) and [[Raygun|ray guns]] and personal [[flying car]]s are commonplace. Space stations exist and [[Space colonization|colonies]] have been [[Colonization of Venus|established]] on the planet Venus (depicted, as common in SF of the time, as a tropical planet habitable by humans).

Space technology is far more advanced than in the actual first decade of the 21st century. For example, in the last scene, a space warship is sent on a twelve-year trip to [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], with not only life-support for a large crew, but also enough armaments&amp;nbsp;— presumably [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]]&amp;nbsp;— to confront an entire world on its own.

However, [[communications satellite]]s have not been thought of, and television broadcasts are still limited to line-of-sight, as they were at the time of writing. This is of critical importance to the plot. The territory of the United States is divided into numerous transmission blocks, which receive television broadcasts from their neighbors and relay them onwards. When the invaders seize one of these blocks, they effectively control all communications within it and can isolate its inhabitants from the outside world, deny the central government any access to them, and consolidate control at their leisure.

The current President - on his second term, and therefore presumably elected in 2000 - had established directly upon being first elected a new intelligece agency, known as The Section. Its  creation was never authorized by Congress and its existence is kept secret, being funded by sums diverted from innocuous sounding items in the Budget. It has a disguised underground headquarters in Washington D.C. and a network of similarly disguised branch offices around the US. Unlike the clearly demarked spheres of the FBI and CIA, the Section carries out extensive espionage in Soviet territory, but also conducts operations inside the United States. If ordered to, its agents are ready to shoot and kill American citizens on US soil. The Section's Director, who had been the President's campaign manager, is universally called &quot;The Old Man&quot;. Only gradually does the reader learn that he is the protagonist's actual father.

==Plot==
[[File:Galaxy 195109.jpg|thumb|right|The opening installment of ''The Puppet Masters'' took the cover of the September 1951 issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'']]
In the summer of 2007, Earth is under clandestine attack.  Slug-like creatures, arriving in flying saucers, are attaching themselves to people's backs, taking control of their victims' nervous systems, and manipulating those people as puppets.  The Old Man, the head of a clandestine national [[security agency]] called the Section, goes to [[Des Moines, Iowa]], with Sam and Mary, two of his best agents, to investigate a flying saucer report, but much more seriously the ominous disappearance of the six agents sent previously. They discover that the slugs are steadily taking over Des Moines, but they cannot convince the [[President of the United States|US president]] to declare an emergency.

Sam takes two other agents and returns to Des Moines to get more evidence of the invasion.  They fail and are obliged to leave the city quickly, but in the confusion of their fleeing the city's television center a slug sneaks onto one of the agents.  Back in Washington the team discovers the slug and captures it, but later it escapes and attaches itself to Sam, using Sam's skills and knowledge to make a clean escape.

Thoroughly puppetized, Sam begins to infiltrate more slugs into the city, using the Constitution Club as a recruiting center.  The Old Man captures him, takes him to Section's new headquarters, and coerces Sam into being taken by the slug again. Under drug-induced hypnosis Sam reveals that the slugs come from [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the sixth moon of [[Saturn]]. Being forced into a traumatic situation strains Sam's relationship with both Mary and the Old Man. Later, Sam finds that the President and [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] are ready to accept the idea that the United States has been infiltrated and they mandate a law that requires people to go naked to demonstrate that they are not carrying slugs.

As the [[United States Army|US Army]] prepares a counter-attack in the most heavily infested areas, Sam goes alone to [[Kansas City]] to get an estimate of the number of slugs involved.  There he learns that he can kill a slug by crushing it with his hand.  He also discovers that the slugs reproduce through fission.  Escaping from the city, he returns to Washington too late to stop the counter-attack, which fails.

After a short leave, during which they get married and kill a slug that seems to have been targeting Sam for repossession, Sam and Mary return to work. Together with the Old Man, they go to [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]] to inspect a flying saucer that had made a bad landing.  Inside the alien ship Mary is overwhelmed by repressed memories from the time she was a child on Venus and had been possessed by a slug.  The slug had died from Nine-day Fever, a severe disease native to Venus, but Mary, luckily, had survived the disease.

Adopting [[biological warfare]], the authorities culture Nine-day Fever and its cure in bulk sufficient to cover the country, and then infected slugs are allowed to escape into the heavily infested areas.  Several days later thousands of medics are landed in those areas to give the cure to those people whose slugs have died.  Sam and the Old Man join the effort in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]], but the Old Man is possessed by the last healthy slug in the city and he knocks Sam out.

Sam regains consciousness in an air-car that the Old Man is flying to the [[Yucatán]], where the slug intends to restart its effort to conquer Humanity.  With the car on autopilot, the Old Man slumps over the steering wheel and the slug begins to fission so that it can possess both the Old Man and Sam.  In desperation, Sam kicks the controls, causing the air-car to accelerate so sharply that the Old Man is slammed back against the seat forcefully enough to crush the slug.  The air-car's emergency system mitigates the resulting crash and Sam and the Old Man wait to be rescued.

Some years later Sam and Mary board a spaceship headed for Saturn on a mission to exterminate the slugs (or at least deliver a serious blow and blunt their appetite for conquest). Sam expresses the hope that a way would be found to save the small elf-like inhabitants of Titan, whom the slugs enslaved before they turned their attention to other planets and with whom Humanity &quot;might get along&quot;.

While the invasion was decisively defeated in the US territory, the situation in the rest of the world remains unclear. There is a reference to the slugs having invaded and effectively taken over the Eastern Bloc, some months before invading the United States - but their ignoring basic hygiene had caused a major outbreak of [[Bubonic Plague]], leading to a  total breakdown of public order in both Russia and China. It remains unclear, however, if that had the same effect of eliminating the slugs as the planned biological warfare resorted to by the Americans. Sam is seen remarking cynically that &quot;it makes no real difference&quot; - evidently, whether or not the Soviet Union is dominated by slugs, the Cold War will continue.

There is also a reference to Britain refusing to follow the US in having its citizens strip down - though the King was willing to go along, the Anglican Church put a veto on the idea - which means that Britain might be taken over by the slugs. The book makes no mention of what the US would do about that.

==Characters==
*'''Sam''', born Elihu Nivens, is the classic Heinlein hero, multi-talented, independent, fiercely loyal to friends and an implacable enemy to foes. He is thirtyish, but has changed appearance so many times even he has doubts as to how he originally looked.
*'''Mary''', born ''Allucquere'' in a religious commune in Antarctica before growing up on Venus, is Heinlein's classic heroine.  She is beautiful, red-headed, hard-nosed and brilliant. Sam describes her as having the &quot;real redheaded saurian bony structure to her skull&quot;. Her professional exterior conceals psychological scars from her encounter with the slugs as a child. Only the Old Man knows the truth about her, thanks to the deep hypnotic analysis that all agents have to undergo.
*'''The Old Man''', born Andrew Nivens, is the head of a top secret government agency that he wishes did not have to exist, doing his job reluctantly because nobody else would do it properly. He represents the third of Heinlein's favorite types of character, the &quot;wise, grumpy old man&quot;.  He is the first in the line that includes [[Jubal Harshaw]], [[The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress|Professor Bernardo de la Paz]], [[I Will Fear No Evil|Johann Sebastian Bach Smith]], [[Gulf (novella)#Characters|&quot;Kettle Belly&quot; Baldwin]], and the later life of [[Lazarus Long]]. (Lazarus Long's grandfather, who has a major role in the later part of ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', is particularly similar in character to &quot;The Old Man&quot;.)

==Alternative version==
Heinlein's original version of the novel was 96,000 words, and was cut to about 60,000 words for both the 1951 book version and the serialization in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]''. For the ''Galaxy'' version, editor [[H. L. Gold]] also did extensive rewriting, to which Heinlein strenuously objected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Il terrore dalla sesta luna|publisher=Mondadori|author=Giuseppe Lippi (introduction)|date=1990|isbn=8804341033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, two years after Heinlein's death, an expanded version was published with the consent of his widow, [[Virginia Heinlein]]. This edition contained material that had been cut from the original published version, because the book was deemed to be too long and controversial for the market in 1951. The uncut version seemed more risqué in 1951 than it did decades later. For example, in the uncut version the book begins with Sam waking up in bed with a blonde whom he had casually picked up the evening before, without even bothering to learn her name; the older version  omitted all mention of her. The 1951 version does mention that men possessed by the invaders lost all sexual feeling&amp;nbsp;— an essential element in the early parts of the plot; the original publisher completely cut out a reference to the &quot;puppet masters&quot; later discovering human sexuality and embarking upon wild orgies, broadcast live on television in the areas under their control.

==Reception==
[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas|McComas]] characterized ''The Puppet Masters'' as &quot;a thunderously exciting melodrama of intrigue&quot;, noting that Heinlein displayed &quot;not only his usual virtues of clear logic, rigorous detail-work, and mastery of indirect exposition&quot;, but also unexpected virtues like &quot;a startling facility in suspense devices [and] a powerful ingenuity in plotting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Recommended Reading,&quot; ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'', February 1952, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. Schuyler Miller]], noting that the novel's &quot;climactic situations seem to be telegraphed&quot;, suggested that Heinlein presented his background situations so effectively that readers solve the story's mysteries more quickly than Heinlein allowed his characters to.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Reference Library&quot;, ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1952, pp.159&lt;/ref&gt; In his &quot;Books&quot; column for ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'', [[Damon Knight]] selected the novel as one of the 10 best [[science fiction|SF]] books of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Books&quot;, ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'', April 1960, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was also reviewed in the 1951 Jun 15 issue of Kirkus Reviews.  The reviewer wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The recurrent enigma of the flying saucer is finally solved when an aerial pieplate is caught with its exhaust down by the F.B.I. of 2007.  Hero Sam penetrates the contaminated area, brings a ‘master' back&amp;nbsp;— a gelatinous gray mass which attaches itself to a soldier's body and controls his thought processes.  Sam and his girl spot further landings, plan a counter campaign and eventually are able to rid the solar system of its parasites.  Exciting, even if it exacts a strong stomach.&lt;ref&gt;Found in the Kirkus Reviews archive at https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-a-heinlein/puppet-masters/ Retrieved 2014 Oct 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

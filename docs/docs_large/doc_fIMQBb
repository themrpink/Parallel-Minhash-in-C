:::::Are you ''sure?'' I believe you just didn't notice the added sentence when you were editing.

'''Editing new pages'''

When I follow a link to a new page, instead of being greeted with the edit box, I get a page that appears to already exist, with the text &quot;Describe the new page here.&quot;.
I know what to do -- click on &quot;Edit this page&quot; -- but this is doubtless quite confusing to newbies.
I think that we should either go back to the old system or make the default text explain the new system instead of the old one.
-- [[user:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]] 2002/05/15

:Correction: This only works incorrectly when following a link to a nonexistent talk page. So it's a namespace bug. -- [[user:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]], Thursday, May 23, 2002

'''Redirects creating Protected Pages'''

I've been transfering user information to user pages using a redirect, but now it creates a protected page and won't let me add any information to it. I'm not sure whether it's the redirect command at fault, or the user: command or the combination, but it's paralysed the transfer of user info out of the mainspace. ~ [[user:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 17th May 2002

:I just redirected [[User:Chris Markides]] (while logged in) and [[User:Stephen Rapley]] (while not logged in) and had no problem with either. Could you try leaving one of these bad redirects in place for a bit so I can examine it? [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Friday, May 17, 2002

I think the redirect only work if you leave a space between the &quot;REDIRECT&quot; and the link you're redirecting to. This wasn't the case before, was it? [[user:jheijmans|jheijmans]]

:That's the first thing I checked (since that recently came up), but Karen's redirects included a space. They look just fine, and identical to the ones I put in that worked. So I'm a bit stumped for now... [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

:Wait, wait... Karen, does the problem look the same as from this redirect page: [[Devangari alphabet]]? (That is, it takes you to a page entitled &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;#REDIRECT [[Devanagari]]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; or similar, *with* the &quot;#REDIRECT&quot; and brackets in the title?) The redirect there looks fine, with a space and everything; I suspect an endline character weirdness or something... Possible fix now in CVS. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Friday, May 17, 2002

'''Weirdness after editing a Talk page'''

After I save an edited Talk page (and only then - not when I look at one), there's this error message on top:

Warning: Supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in /home/wiki-newest/work-http/wikiPage.php on line 215

Warning: Supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in /home/wiki-newest/work-http/wikiPage.php on line 219

The page itself looks fine if you leave and then look at it again (I didn't try what might happen if I immediately reloaded the page.) I only noticed this happening as of today. -- [[user:Marj Tiefert|Marj Tiefert]], Friday, May 17, 2002

:This happens whenever you save a new page for the first time; it does seem to be new (within the last few days). I'm not quite sure what's wrong, but it looks to be related to the bit that checks for pages that link to the new page and clears their cache. It's mostly harmless; it just means that links to newly created pages might continue to look like nonexistent links for a while. I'll try to fix it... [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Friday, May 17, 2002

:Got it; coupla one-character typos in the code. Sigh. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Monday, May 20, 2002

 &lt;font color=red&gt;STATUS: FIXED IN CVS as of 2002-05-20&lt;/font&gt;

=== No minor edits possible ===

When editing some pages (including this one), I cannot use the &quot;minor edit&quot; checkbox anymore, while it was there when I created a new page. May, 23, 2002, [[user:jheijmans|jheijmans]]

:I had the same problem several hours ago -- however before saving I looked up and instead of seeing my user name on the login panel I saw my IP address. But when I saved, the save was logged as being created by my user name. Everything is OK now. --[[user:maveric149|maveric149]]

:This is a symptom of the same long-suffering(-causing) cookie path problem that makes http://www.wikipedia.com/ not appear as logged in. (Users who aren't logged in can't make minor edits, so the check box is missing from the edit page.) A fix for this is in the development version; once it's installed, you can log out and log back in to fix your login cookie. In the meantime, you can manually fix your cookie. (If you're using Netscape or Mozilla this is easy; I don't know about Internet Explorer or Opera or other browsers...) First, close your browser so it doesn't write over your changes. Now, edit the cookies file (cookies, cookies.txt, or some freaky collection of a million files as in IE) and find the cookies for www.wikipedia.com named WikiUserID, WikiLoggedIn, and (if you checked the 'save password' box) WikiUserPassword. There should be a &quot;/wiki/&quot; in the list of cookie goodness for each of these; change it to &quot;/&quot;. Save, close, open up your browser again, everything should work.

:If you're not brave enough to mess with your cookies, just hit the &quot;preview&quot; button before actually saving; it'll come up with you logged in still, and you can check the minor edit box there. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Thursday, May 23, 2002

::This isn't much of a solution.  Basically, it means that the only times I can use the &quot;minor edit&quot; box are (a) when I'm creating a completely new article and (b) when I do a preview first. In other words, it only appears on the two occasions when I am least likely to want it. [[user:Deb]]

:Did you skip the part where I explained that the problem is already fixed (for the future) in the development version, and that you can fix it yourself to work properly NOW by editing your cookies? If you're neither patient nor willing to tinker yourself, well I'm very sorry, but there's not much I can do about it. --[[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Monday, May 27, 2002

::FWIW, I edited my cookies and the problem is still there. I'll have to take a closer look (at the files on my computer, that is &amp;mdash; the programme code is your end). But in the meantime, I'd like to strongly suggest that one ''always'' press &lt;code&gt;Preview&lt;/code&gt; before pressing &lt;code&gt;Save&lt;/code&gt;, no matter how minor the edit &amp;mdash; better safe than sorry. Given that, you just need to get into the habit of marking your edit as minor towards the end of the editing process rather than towards the beginning. (Also a good idea, since I've noticed that sometimes minor edits end up not being so minor once I'm through with them!) &amp;mdash; [[user:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]], Tuesday, May 28, 2002

:Thank you for your helpful responses, gents.  I had understood the &quot;explanation&quot; above to mean that, if one logged off and then logged on again, the problem should be resolved - evidently it meant something else.  I also didn't realise that the words, &quot;some freaky collection of a million files&quot; were designed to enable me to find the cookies in order to edit them.  Bravery doesn't come into it.

=== I want to edit it and it answers back ===

Whoever did this had some skills and nothing better to do with them. I edited &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;. After that, I try to edit it a second time, and instead of the text, I find a smart-ass reply in the editing box. I didn't try to edit it again, I was too pissed off. I don't know if it would do the same think to you, try it out yourselves.

'''Erich Johann Albert Raeder''' (24 April 1876 – 6 November 1960{{cn|date=December 2019}}) was a German admiral who played a major role in the [[naval history of World War II]]. Raeder attained the highest possible naval rank, that of [[Grand Admiral]], in 1939, becoming the first person to hold that rank since [[Henning von Holtzendorff]]. Raeder led the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' for the first half of the war; he resigned in January 1943 and was replaced by [[Karl Dönitz]]. At the [[Nuremberg Trials]] he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] but was released early owing to failing health.

==Early career==
{{refimprove-section|date=July 2019}}
{{main|Erich Raeder pre Grand Admiral}}

===Early years===
Raeder was born in [[Wandsbek (quarter)|Wandsbek]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Keith W.|last=Bird|date=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bK3DoWaOvg0C&amp;pg=PT19|title=Erich Raeder: Admiral of the Third Reich|page=19|isbn=978-1-55750-047-2|publisher=[[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]]|accessdate=2019-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[province of Schleswig-Holstein]] in the [[German Empire]]. His father was a headmaster, who as a teacher and a father was noted for his marked authoritarian views, and who impressed upon his son the values of hard work, thrift, faith and obedience – all values that Raeder preached throughout his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith pp. 1–2&quot;&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Raeder also warned his children that if Germany were to become a democracy, that would be a disaster as it meant government by men &quot;playing politics&quot; – doing what was only best for their petty sectarian interests instead of the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith pp. 1–2&quot;/&gt;

===Imperial German Navy===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R10687, Vizeadmiral Hipper mit Stab.jpg|thumb|Erich Raeder (second from left) and the staff of Vice Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]] (center), 1916]]
Raeder joined the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy) in 1894 and rapidly rose in rank, becoming Chief of Staff for [[Franz von Hipper]] in 1912. From 1901 to 1903 Raeder served on the staff of [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862–1929)|Prince Heinrich of Prussia]], and gained a powerful patron in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;Thomas p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Raeder's rise up the ranks was due mostly to his intelligence and hard work.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to his cold and distant personality, Raeder was a man whom even his friends often admitted to knowing very little about.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; The dominating figure of the Navy was Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the autocratic State Secretary of the Navy. Tirpitz's preferred means of obtaining &quot;world power status&quot; was through his ''Risikotheorie'' (risk theory) where Germany would build a ''Risikoflotte'' (Risk Fleet) that would make it too dangerous for Britain to risk a war with Germany, and thereby alter the international balance of power decisively in the ''Reich'''s favor. Tirpitz transformed the Navy from the small coastal defense force of 1897 into the mighty High Seas Fleet of 1914.

In 1904, Raeder, who spoke fluent [[Russian language|Russian]], was sent to the [[Far East]] as an observer of the [[Russo-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith p. 13&quot;&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1905, Raeder worked in the public relations section of the Navy, where he first met Tirpitz and began his introduction to politics by briefing journalists to run articles promoting the ''Seemachtideologie'' and meeting politicians who held seats in the ''Reichstag'' in order to convert them to the ''Seemachtideologie''.&lt;ref&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Working closely with Tirpitz, Raeder was heavily involved in the lobbying the ''Reichstag'' to pass the [[German Naval Laws|Third Navy Law]] of 1906 which committed Germany to building &quot;all big gun battleships&quot; to compete with the new British {{sclass-|Dreadnought|battleship|4}} in the Anglo-German naval race that had begun early in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith pp. 14–15&quot;&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raeder was the captain of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s private yacht in the years leading up to World War I. In itself, this was not a rewarding post, but often people in this post were quickly promoted afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;BirdErich&quot;&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
Raeder served as Hipper's Chief of Staff during World War I, as well as in combat posts. He took part in the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] in 1915 and in the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916. Raeder later described Hipper as an admiral who &quot;hated paperwork&quot;; accordingly, Hipper delegated considerable power to Raeder, who thus enjoyed more influence than his position as chief of staff would suggest.&lt;ref&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after World War I the German navy had divided into two factions. One faction, led by Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] (1849–1930), consisted of avid followers of the teachings of the American historian [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] (1840–1914) and believed in building a &quot;balanced fleet&quot; centred around the battleship that would, if war came, seek out and win a decisive [[battle of annihilation]] (''Entscheidungsschlacht'') against the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Another faction, led by Commander [[Wolfgang Wegener]] (1875–1956), argued that because of superior British shipbuilding capacity Germany could never hope to build a &quot;balanced fleet&quot; capable of winning an ''Entscheidungsschlacht'', and so the best use of German naval strength was to build a fleet of cruisers and submarines that would wage a ''[[guerre de course]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig pp. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; After reading all three of Wegener's papers setting out his ideas, Admiral Hipper decided to submit them to the Admiralty in Berlin, but changed his mind after reading a paper by Raeder attacking the &quot;[[Wegener thesis]]&quot; as flawed.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the beginning of a long feud between Raeder and Wegener, with Wegener claiming that his former friend Raeder was jealous of what Wegener insisted were his superior ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen pp. 81–108&quot;&gt;Hansen p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1916 Raeder played a major role planning a raid by Hipper's battlecruisers that aimed to lure out the British battlecruiser force which would then be destroyed by the main High Seas Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; This raid turned into the [[Battle of Jutland]]. Raeder played a prominent role, and was forced midway through the battle to transfer from {{SMS|Lützow}} to {{SMS|Moltke}} as a result of damage to Hipper's flagship.

As Chief of Staff to Admiral Hipper he was closely involved in a plan of Hipper's for a German battlecruiser squadron to sail across the Atlantic and sweep through the waters off Canada down to the West Indies and on to South America to sink the British cruisers operating in those waters, and thereby force the British to redeploy a substantial part of the Home Fleet to the New World.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith p. 89&quot;&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Hipper's plans were rejected{{when|date=February 2017}} as far too risky, they significantly influenced Raeder's later thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 1918, Raeder received a major promotion with appointment as deputy to Admiral [[Paul Behncke]], the Naval State Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Raeder had doubts about submarines, but he spent the last weeks of the war working to achieve the Scheer Programme of building 450 U-boats.

On 28 October 1918 the Imperial German fleet mutinied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith p. 34&quot;&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Raeder played a major role in attempting to crush the mutiny.

==Weimar Republic==
{{refimprove-section|date=July 2019}}
Raeder's two younger brothers were both killed in action in the First World War, and in 1919 his first marriage, which had been under heavy strain due to war-related stress, ended in divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith p. 49&quot;&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; For the puritanical Raeder, the divorce was a huge personal disgrace, and for the rest of his life he always denied his first marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith p. 49&quot;/&gt; The years 1918–1919 were some of the most troubled in his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith p. 49&quot;/&gt;

===High Seas Fleet mutiny===
In the winter of 1918–19, Raeder was closely involved in the efforts of the naval officer corps, strongly backed by the Defense Minister [[Gustav Noske]] – a Majority Social Democrat with firm law and order views – to disband the sailors' councils established after the mutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Raeder served as the liaison between the naval officer corps and Noske, and it was Raeder who suggested to Noske on 11 January 1919 that [[Adolf von Trotha]] be appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith p. 37&quot;&gt;Bird ''Erich Raeder'' p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Tirpitz's attacks on the Emperor's leadership during the war had caused a split in the officer corps between the followers of &quot;the Master&quot; and the Kaiser, and Raeder wanted Trotha as the only officer acceptable to both factions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith p. 37&quot;/&gt; Noske in turn asked the Navy for volunteers for the ''[[Freikorps]]'' to crush uprisings from the Communists.&lt;ref&gt;Bird ''Weimar'' pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy contributed two brigades to the ''Freikorps''.&lt;ref&gt;Bird ''Weimar'' pp. 46–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The price of the Navy supporting the ''Freikorps'' was the continuation of the Navy's &quot;state-within-the state&quot; status and the end of attempts to democratise the military. Under the [[Weimar Republic]], the military considered itself ''überparteiliche'' (above party), which did not mean political neutrality as implied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith p. 140&quot;&gt;Bird ''Weimar'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The military argued that there were two types of &quot;politics&quot;: ''parteipolitisch'' (party politics) which was the responsibility of the politicians, and ''staatspolitisch'' (state politics) which was the responsibility of the military.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith p. 140&quot;/&gt; ''Staatspolitisch'' concerned Germany's &quot;eternal&quot; interests and the &quot;historic mission&quot; of winning world power, which was to be pursued regardless of what the politicians or the people wanted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird, Keith p. 140&quot;/&gt;

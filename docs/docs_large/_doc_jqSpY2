In the colloquies between Wotan and Brünnhilde, several soundings of the &quot;Woman's Worth&quot; motif are heard. The  &quot;Annunciation of Death&quot; motif is the crucial point, where the two narratives (Wotan/Brünnhilde and Siegmund/Sieglinde) come together. Wagner chose the tonality of F♯ minor for this scene, eventually modulating to B minor in preparation for the Valkyries' entry in Act 3.{{sfn|Bailey|1977|pp=55–57}}

===Act 3===
The act opens with the famous sequence known as the &quot;[[Ride of the Valkyries]]&quot;, formed by combining the Valkyries' own belligerent theme with  Brünnhilde's war cry from act 2.{{sfn|Osborne|1992|p=214}} The Ride has achieved lasting popularity as an orchestral concert piece outside the framework of the ''Ring'' cycle; according to Newman, in the orchestral version and sometimes within the opera itself, the basis staccato phrasing is corrupted by eliding the second and third notes and emphasising the fourth rather than the first as originally written.{{sfn|Newman|1949|p=540}}

At the midpoint of the act, prior to Wotan's vengeful entrance and the long denouement with Brünnhilde, we hear the &quot;Reconciliation&quot; motif (&quot;Redemption by Love&quot; per Newman) in which Sieglinde praises Brünnhilde for her rescue: &quot;O highest of wonders! Noblest of maids!&quot;.{{sfn|Newman|1949|p=541}} The motif will next be heard at the very end of the ''Ring'' cycle, bringing the entire tetralogy to a close on a note of reconciliation and optimism.{{sfn|Holman|2001|p=140}}

[[File:Renatus Mészár as Wotan in Die Walküre.jpg|thumb|[[Renatus Mészár]] as Wotan, Weimar 2008]]
The final section of the act is marked by what Millington describes as &quot;a succession of carefully controlled climaxes&quot;, of which the most affecting is that of Wotan's farewell to his errant daughter.{{sfn|Millington|2006|p=114}} The music is eventually dominated by the five falling notes of Brünnhilde's &quot;Sleep&quot; motif which, when Wotan has used his spear to summon Loge, is transformed into the &quot;Magic Fire&quot; music as Brünnhilde is encircled in the ring of fire, and Wotan sadly departs.{{sfn|Holman|2001|p=120}}

==Critical assessment==

The first Munich performances  of ''Die Walküre'' were generally hailed as successes by audiences and critics; leading composers who were present greeted the work with acclaim, recognising in it evidence of Wagner's genius.{{sfn|Osborne|1992|p=203}} One dissident voice was presented by the critic of the ''Süddeutsche Presse'', who was scathing about the dearth of moral standards expressed in the story and furthermore found the whole experience tedious: the first act was, for the most part, &quot;wearyingly long-winded&quot;; the second act only occasionally sprang to life, while in the third it was &quot;barely possible to hear isolated shrieks from the singers through the tumult of the orchestra&quot;.{{sfn|Osborne|1992|pp=202–203}} The overall effect was &quot;not agreeable ... permeated with what one can only call pagan sensuality, and ... produces finally nothing but an enervating dullness&quot;.{{sfn|Osborne|1992|pp=202–203}} This harsh, if isolated judgement, found some echo six years later, when ''Die Walküre'' was first performed at Bayreuth as part of the ''Ring'' cycle. Critics could now form relative views on the merits of the four operas. Although there was general admiration for the first act, ''Die Walküre'' emerged as the least-liked of the four, in particular on account of the second act, deemed &quot;a great failure&quot; and an &quot;abyss of boredom&quot;.{{sfn|Spotts|1994|p=72}}

More generally, while recognising the existence of a few ''longeurs'', modern critics of ''Die Walküre'' have recorded much more positive opinions. To [[Charles Osborne (music writer)|Charles Osborne]] it is &quot;marvellously rich ... Wagner has found a way to integrate his voice parts into the overall structure without sacrificing their lyrical independence&quot;. It is, he says, the opera that stands up most strongly outside the tetralogy, and is popular enough to be staged frequently on its own, even within Bayreuth festivals.{{sfn|Osborne|1992|pp=216–217}}{{refn|The 2018 Bayreuth Festival broke new ground by presenting ''Die Walküre'' alone, outside the full cycle which was not performed that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayreuth Festival 2018: The latest Wagner celebration begins |url= https://www.dw.com/en/bayreuth-festival-2018-the-latest-wagner-celebration-begins/a-44815554|publisher= DW|date= 25 July 2018|accessdate = 11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Writing in 2006, Millington thought that, notwithstanding the liberal use of ensembles in the third act,  ''Die Walküre'' showed the greatest fidelity of the four operas to the theoretical principles expressed by Wagner in ''Opera and Drama'': &quot;A thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression&quot;.{{sfn|Millington|2006|p=114}}  The modern view is that, of the ''Ring'' operas, ''Die Walküre'' is both the most approachable and the one that can most successfully be performed in extracts.{{sfn|Millington|2006|p=114}}

'''''Siegfried''''' ({{IPA-de|/ˈziːk.fʀiːt/|lang|De-Siegfried.ogg}}), [[Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis|WWV]] 86C, is the third of the four [[music drama]]s that constitute ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' (''The Ring of the Nibelung''), by [[Richard Wagner]]. It premiered at the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] on 16 August 1876, as part of the first complete performance of ''The Ring'' cycle.

==Background and context==

{{Quote box|width=300px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align= left|quote=  '''Structure of the ''Ring'' cycle'''&lt;br /&gt;
#''[[Das Rheingold]]''
#''[[Die Walküre]]''
#''Siegfried''
#''[[Götterdämmerung]]'' |salign = left|source= }}

The libretto of ''Siegfried'' was drafted by Wagner in November–December 1852, based on an earlier version he had prepared in May–June 1851 and originally entitled ''Jung-Siegfried'' (''Young Siegfried''), later changed to ''Der junge Siegfried''. The musical composition was commenced in 1856, but not finally completed until 1871.&lt;ref name= &quot;Millingtonnd&quot;&gt;Millington, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The libretto arose from Wagner's gradual reconception of the project he had initiated with his libretto ''Siegfrieds Tod'' (''Siegfried's Death'') which was eventually to be incarnated as ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'', the final section of the Ring cycle. Having grappled with his text for ''Siegfrieds Tod'', and indeed having undertaken some musical sketches for it during 1851, he realized that it would need a 'preface'. At this point he conceived that the prefatory opera, ''Der junge Siegfried'', could act as a comic foil to the tragedy of ''Siegfrieds Tod''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1977), 49&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary musical sketches for ''Der junge Siegfried'' in 1851 were however quickly abandoned, although Wagner had written to his friend [[Theodor Uhlig]] that &quot;the musical phrases are making themselves for these stanzas and periods, without my even having to take pains for them. It's all growing out of the ground as if it were wild.&quot; Shortly afterwards he wrote to Uhlig that he was now planning to tell the Siegfried story in the form of &quot;three dramas, plus a prologue in three acts&quot;—a clear prefiguring of the Ring cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1977), 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Full work was finally commenced on the music of ''Siegfried'', as the composer henceforth referred to it, in 1856, when Wagner prepared concurrently two drafts, a complete draft in pencil and a version in ink on up to three [[staff (music)|staves]] in which he worked out details of instrumentation and vocal line. The composition of Acts 1 and 2 was completed by August 1857. Wagner then left off work on ''[[Siegfried]]'' to write the operas ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' and ''[[Die Meistersinger]].'' He did not resume work on ''Siegfried'' until 1869, when he composed the third act. The final revision of the score was undertaken in February 1871. Performance was withheld until the first complete production of the Ring cycle, at Bayreuth in August 1876.&lt;ref name= &quot;Millingtonnd&quot;/&gt;

== Synopsis ==

=== Act 1 ===

====Scene 1====
[[File:Nibelung letimotiv.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Leitmotif for the Nibelungs]]A cave in rocks in the forest. An orchestral introduction includes references to [[leitmotif]]s including themes relating to the original hoard plundered by the [[Nibelung]] [[Alberich]], and one in B-flat minor associated with the Nibelungs themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (n.d.), 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; As the curtain rises, Alberich's brother, the dwarf Mime, is forging a sword. Mime is plotting to obtain the ring of power originally created by his brother [[Alberich]]. He has raised the human boy Siegfried as a foster child, to kill Fafner, who obtained the ring and other treasures in the opera ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and has since transformed himself from a giant to a dragon. Mime needs a sword for Siegfried to use, but the youth has contemptuously broken every sword Mime has made. Siegfried returns from his wanderings in the forest with a wild bear in tow, and immediately breaks the new sword. After a whining speech by Mime about ingratitude, and how Mime has brought him up from a mewling infant (&quot;Als zullendes Kind&quot;), Siegfried senses why he keeps coming back to Mime although he despises him: he wants to know his parentage. Mime is forced to explain that he encountered Siegfried's mother, Sieglinde, when she was in labor; she died giving birth to Siegfried. He shows Siegfried the broken pieces of the sword [[Nothung]], which she had left in his custody. Siegfried orders him to reforge the sword; however, Mime is unable to accomplish this. Siegfried departs, leaving Mime in despair.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (n.d.), 4–32&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scene 2====
An old man (Wotan in disguise) arrives at the door and introduces himself as the Wanderer. In return for the hospitality due a guest, he wagers his head on answering any three questions Mime may ask. The dwarf asks the Wanderer to name the races that live beneath the ground, on the earth, and in the skies. These are the Nibelung, the Giants, and the Gods, as the Wanderer answers correctly. The Wanderer then induces Mime to wager his own head on three further riddles: the race most beloved of Wotan, but most harshly treated; the name of the sword that can destroy Fafner; and the person who can repair the sword. Mime answers the first two questions: the Wälsungs (Siegmund and Sieglinde whose tale is told in the opera ''[[Die Walküre]]'') and the sword Nothung. Mime has no problem with the first two questions, but cannot answer the last one. Wotan spares Mime, telling him that only &quot;he who does not know fear&quot; can reforge Nothung, and leaves Mime's head forfeit to that person.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (n.d.), 34–51&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scene 3====
Mime despairs as he imagines the ferocity of the dragon Fafner, while &quot;the orchestra paints a dazzling picture of flickering lights and roaring flames&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Millingtonnd&quot;/&gt; Siegfried returns and is annoyed by Mime's lack of progress. Mime realizes that Siegfried is &quot;the one who does not know fear&quot; and that unless he can instill fear in him, Siegfried will kill him as the Wanderer foretold. He tells Siegfried that fear is an essential craft; Siegfried is eager to learn it, and Mime promises to teach him by taking him to Fafner. Since Mime was unable to forge Nothung, Siegfried decides to do it himself. He succeeds by shredding the metal, melting it, and casting it anew. In the meantime, Mime brews a poisoned drink to offer Siegfried after the youth has defeated the dragon. After he finishes forging the sword, Siegfried demonstrates its strength by chopping the anvil in half with it.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (n.d.), 51–86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act 2===

====Scene 1====
[[File:Siefgriedhorncall.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Horncall from Act II of 'Siegfried' (Siegfried's leitmotif)]] [[File:Ring45.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|Siegfried tastes the dragon's blood ([[Arthur Rackham|Rackham]])]]
Deep in the forest. The Wanderer arrives at the entrance to Fafner's cave, where Alberich is keeping vigil. The two enemies recognize each other.  Alberich boasts of his plans to regain the ring and rule the world. Wotan states that he does not intend to interfere, only to observe.  He even offers to awaken the dragon so that Alberich can bargain with him.  Alberich warns the dragon that a hero is coming to kill him, and offers to prevent the fight in exchange for the ring. Fafner dismisses the threat, declines Alberich's offer, and returns to sleep. Wotan leaves and Alberich withdraws, muttering threats.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (n.d.), 87–105&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scene 2====
At daybreak, Siegfried and Mime arrive. After assuring Siegfried that the dragon will teach him what fear is, Mime withdraws. As Siegfried waits for the dragon to appear, he hears a woodbird singing. He attempts to mimic the bird's song using a reed pipe, but is unsuccessful. He then plays a tune on his horn, which brings Fafner out of his cave. After a short exchange, they fight; Siegfried stabs Fafner in the heart with Nothung. In his last moments, Fafner learns Siegfried's name, and tells him to beware of treachery. When Siegfried withdraws his sword from Fafner's body, his hands are burned by the dragon's blood and he puts his finger in his mouth. On tasting the blood, he finds that he can understand the woodbird's song. Following its instructions, he takes the ring and the magic helmet [[Tarnhelm]] from Fafner's hoard.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (n.d.), 106–131&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scene 3====
Outside the cave, Alberich and Mime quarrel over the treasure.  Alberich hides as Siegfried comes out of the cave.  Siegfried complains to Mime that he has still not learned the meaning of fear.  Mime offers him the poisoned drink; however, the magic power of the dragon's blood allows Siegfried to read Mime's treacherous thoughts, and he stabs him to death. He throws Mime's body into the treasure cave and places Fafner's body in the cave entrance to block it. The woodbird now sings of a woman sleeping on a rock surrounded by magic fire. Siegfried, wondering if he can learn fear from this woman, follows the bird towards the rock.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (n.d.), 132–157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act 3===
[[File:Siegfried awakens Brunhild.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Siegfried awakens Brünnhilde - Otto von Richter, (1892)]]

====Scene 1====
At the foot of Brünnhilde's rock. The Wanderer summons Erda, the earth goddess. Erda, appearing confused, is unable to offer any advice. Wotan informs her that he no longer fears the [[Götterdämmerung|end of the gods]]; indeed, it is his desire. His heritage will be left to Siegfried the Wälsung, and Brünnhilde (Erda's and Wotan's child), who will &quot;work the deed that redeems the World.&quot; Dismissed, Erda sinks back into the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (n.d.), 158–175&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scene 2====
Siegfried arrives, and the Wanderer questions the youth. Siegfried, who does not recognize his grandfather, answers insolently and starts down the path toward Brünnhilde's rock. The Wanderer blocks his path, but Siegfried mocks him, laughing at his floppy hat and his missing eye, and breaks his spear (the symbol of Wotan's authority) with a blow from Nothung. Wotan calmly gathers up the pieces and vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (n.d.), 175–193&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scene 3====
Siegfried passes through the ring of fire, emerging on Brünnhilde's rock. At first, he thinks the sleeping armored figure is a man. However, when he removes the armor, he finds a woman beneath.  At the sight of the first woman he has ever seen, Siegfried at last experiences fear. In desperation, he kisses Brünnhilde, waking her from her magic sleep. Hesitant at first, Brünnhilde is won over by Siegfried's love, and renounces the world of the gods. Together, they hail &quot;light-bringing love, and laughing death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (n.d.), 193–237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Elements of the plot of ''Siegfried'' come from a variety of sources.

In a letter to Uhlig, Wagner recounted ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]'', based on a fairy-tale of the [[Brothers Grimm]]. It concerns a boy so stupid he had never learned to be afraid. Wagner wrote that the boy and Siegfried are the same character. The boy is taught to fear by his wife, and Siegfried learns it when he discovers the sleeping Brünnhilde.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar (2003) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegfried's ability in Act Two to see through Mime's deceitful words seems to have been derived from a 19th-century [[street theatre]] version of the story of [[Faust]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Millingtonnd&quot;/&gt;

Some elements of the story are derived from legends of [[Sigurd]], notably the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' and the ''[[Legends about Theoderic the Great#The Thidrekssaga|Thidrekssaga]]''. Scene 1 of Act 3 (between The Wanderer and Erda) has a parallel in the [[Eddic poem]] ''[[Baldrs draumar]]'', in which [[Odin]] questions a [[völva]] about the future of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Malm (2000), 277&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernhard von Reesen''' (born ca. 1490) was an [[art collector]] born to a [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] family in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] (Gdańsk), in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]].

Reesen was highly educated as was the custom for men of his background at that time. As a wealthy businessman and civic official, at the age of thirty, Reesen commissioned [[Albrecht Dürer]] of [[Nuremberg]] to paint his portrait in 1520/21. The painting can be seen in the permanent exhibition of Old Masters in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]].

The Reesen name, with its prefix &quot;von&quot; (of), indicates that the family had its origins in the city of [[Rees, Germany|Rees]].

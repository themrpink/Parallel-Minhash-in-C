In the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' [[Nagarjuna]] seizes the dichotomy between objects as collections of properties or as separate from those properties to demonstrate that both assertions fall apart under analysis. By uncovering this paradox he then provides a solution (''[[pratītyasamutpāda]]'' – &quot;dependent origination&quot;) that lies at the very root of [[Buddhist]] praxis. Although Pratītyasamutpāda is normally limited to caused objects, Nagarjuna extends his argument to objects in general by differentiating two distinct ideas – dependent designation and dependent origination. He proposes that all objects are dependent upon designation, and therefore any discussion regarding the nature of objects can only be made in light of the context. The validity of objects can only be established within those conventions that assert them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā#24:18.2C 24:19|''MMK'' 24:18]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
[[Bertrand Russell]] updated the classical terminology with one more term, the ''[[fact]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1948|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Everything that there is in the world I call a fact.&quot; Facts, objects, are opposed to [[belief]]s, which are &quot;subjective&quot; and may be errors on the part of the subject, the knower who is their source and who is certain of himself and little else. All doubt implies the possibility of error and therefore admits the distinction between subjectivity and objectivity. The knower is limited in ability to tell fact from belief, false from true objects and engages in reality testing, an activity that will result in more or less certainty regarding the reality of the object. According to Russell,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1948|pp=148–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;we need a description of the fact which would make a given belief true&quot; where &quot;Truth is a property of beliefs.&quot; Knowledge is &quot;true beliefs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1948|p=154}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Value theory===
[[Value theory]] concerns the value of objects. When it concerns [[economic value]], it generally deals with [[physical objects]]. However, when concerning [[philosophic or ethic value]], an object may be both a [[physical object]] and an [[abstract object]] (e.g. an action).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Physics===
Limiting discussions of objecthood to the realm of physical objects may simplify them. However, defining physical objects in terms of [[fundamental particle]]s (e.g. [[quark]]s) leaves open the question of what is the [[philosophy of physics|nature of a fundamental particle]] and thus asks what [[category of being|categories of being]] can be used to explain physical objects.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Semantics===
[[Symbol]]s represent objects; how they do so, the [[map–territory relation]], is the basic problem of [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dąmbska|first=Izydora|year=2016|title=Symbols|url=|journal=Poznan Studies in the Philosophy of the Sciences &amp; the Humanities|volume=105|pages=201–209|via=Humanities Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hake Prepared Grill.jpg|thumb|Grilled hake]]
The term '''hake''' {{IPAc-en|h|eɪ|k}} refers to fish in the:
* Family [[Merlucciidae]] of northern and southern oceans&lt;ref name=&quot;SmithsFishes&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smith, Margaret M. |author2=Heemstra, Philip C. | title = Smiths' sea fishes | publisher = Southern Book Publishers | location = Grahamstown, South Africa | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-1-86812-032-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Family [[Phycidae]] (sometimes considered the subfamily Phycinae in the family [[Gadidae]]) of the northern oceans

==Hake==
Hake is in the same taxonomic order ([[Gadiformes]]) as [[cod]] and [[haddock]]. It is a medium-to-large fish averaging from {{convert|1|to|8|lb}} in weight, with specimens as large as {{convert|60|lb}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;theworldwidegourmet1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theworldwidegourmet.com/products/fish/hake/ |title=Hake - all about fish on The Worldwide Gourmet |publisher=Theworldwidegourmet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fish can grow up to {{convert|1|m}} in length with a [[life expectancy|lifespan]] of as long as 14 years. Hake may be found in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]] in waters from {{convert|200|to|350|m|0}} deep. The fish stay in deep water during the day and come to shallower depths during the night. An undiscerning [[predator]], hake feed on prey found near or on the [[Seabed|bottom of the sea]]. Male and female hake are very similar in appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/south-atlantic-indian-ocean/south-africa-hake-trawl-fishery |title=South Africa hake trawl — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[spawning]], the hake eggs float on the surface of the sea where the larvae develop. After a certain period of time, the baby hake then migrate to the bottom of the sea, preferring depths of less than {{convert|200|m|0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

A total of 12 hake species are known in the family [[Merlucciidae]]:

*[[Argentine hake]] (''Merluccius hubbsi''), found off [[Argentina]]
*Benguela hake (''Merluccius poli''), found off [[South Africa]]
*Deep-water hake (''[[Merluccius paradoxus]]'') found in the [[South Atlantic|southern Atlantic Ocean]]
*[[European hake]] (''Merluccius merluccius''), found off the [[Atlantic Europe|Atlantic coast of Europe]] and western [[North Africa]], in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and in the [[Black Sea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/species/2238/en |title=FAO Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture – Species Fact Sheets – ''Merluccius merluccius'' (Linneaus, 1758) (''sic'') |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gayi hake (''Merluccius gayi''), found in the [[North Pacific Ocean]]
*[[North Pacific hake]] (''Merluccius productus''), found in the North Pacific Ocean
*[[Offshore hake]] (''Merluccius albidus''), found off the [[United States]]
*Panama hake (''Merluccius angustimanus''), found in the Mediterranean Sea
*Senegalese hake (''Merluccius senegalensis''), found off the Atlantic coast of western [[North Africa]]

*[[Silver hake]] (''Merluccius bilinearis''), found in the [[Northwest Atlantic|Northwest Atlantic Ocean]]
*Southern hake (''Merluccius australis''), found off [[Chile]]

Not all hake species are viewed as commercially important, but the deep-water and shallow-water hakes are known to grow rapidly and make up the majority of harvested species.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Commercial use==
The highest demand for hake has been in Europe. Hake has been primarily divided into three principal levels—fresh, frozen, and frozen [[Fish fillet|fillet]]. Fresh hake is mainly supplied by European production and imports. Frozen hake and frozen hake fillet are effectively supplied by imports and European processing companies.

[[Spain]] has the highest consumption of hake in Europe, with a yearly consumption of {{convert|6|kg|lb}} per person. This works out to around half of all hake eaten in Europe. Though Spanish consumption of hake and other fish declined in the last decade (second fish consumption in the world after Japan), hake still accounts for about one third of total fish consumption there. Other countries that eat a lot of hake include France, Italy, and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gemub.com/pdf/llucjordi.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - llucjordi.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923061412/http://www.gemub.com/pdf/llucjordi.pdf |archivedate=2010-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, fresh hake are mostly purchased by restaurants through retailers. Nonetheless, processed hake products are distributed by hake wholesalers. Fishmongers, public markets and hypermarkets sell hake in various forms: frozen fillet, fillet skin-on, fillet skin-off, etc.

In [[France]], fish are generally purchased in supermarkets. Due to insufficient European hake, French [[wholesalers]] purchase fresh hake from external countries such as [[Argentina]] and [[Namibia]], and then export them to Spain. Fresh hake is mostly exported to Spain.

In Italy, hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, and institutional purchasers purchase much seafood. However, retailers and wholesalers purchase most frozen hake fillets to sell in markets.

In [[Ireland]], hake is a popular fish sold freshly from the Atlantic Ocean in [[supermarket]]s and by local [[fishmonger]]s.

In the [[United Kingdom]], hake is used in [[fish and chips]].

===Commercially salable forms===
Hake is sold as frozen, [[Fish fillet|fillets]] or steaks, fresh, [[Smoked fish|smoked]], or [[Salted fish|salted]].

===Buying criteria===
When buying hake fillet or other hake product, consumers should look for hake with white [[flesh]] that is free of signs of [[Browning (food process)|browning]], dryness, or grayness, and a seawater fresh smell.&lt;ref name=&quot;theworldwidegourmet1&quot;/&gt;

===Fisheries===
The main catching method of deep-water hake is primarily [[trawling]], and shallow-water hake is mostly caught by inshore trawl and [[longlining]]. Hake are mostly found in the Southwest Atlantic ([[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]), Southeast Pacific ([[Chile]] and [[Peru]]), Southeast Atlantic ([[Namibia]] and [[South Africa]]), Southwest Pacific ([[New Zealand]]), and [[Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]] ([[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]] and [[France]]).

;Over-exploitation
Due to [[over-fishing]], Argentine hake catches have declined drastically. About 80% of adult hake has apparently disappeared from Argentine waters. Argentine hake is not expected to disappear, but the stock may be so low that it is no longer economic for commercial fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/03/22/argentine-hake-fishery-and-markets-at-risk-because-of-over-fishing-says-ngo |title=Argentine hake fishery and markets at risk because of over-fishing, says NGO — MercoPress |publisher=En.mercopress.com |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, this adversely affects employment, because many people lose their jobs in the fishing industries. On the other hand, Argentine hake prices are rising due to scarcity. This has reduced exports, which ultimately affects the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;globefish1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globefish.org/hake-january-2010.html |title=Fao Globefish |publisher=Globefish.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chile, seafood exports, especially Chilean hake, have decreased dramatically. Hake export has decreased by almost 19 percent. The main cause of this decline is the February [[2010 Chile earthquake]] and [[tsunami]]. These disasters destroyed most processing plants, especially manufacturing companies that produce [[fish meal]] and frozen fillets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fis.com/fis/worldnews/worldnews.asp?monthyear=&amp;day=27&amp;id=37905&amp;l=e&amp;special=&amp;ndb=1%20target= |title=Worldnews - Sharp decline in exports to the south-central area |publisher=FIS |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European hake catches are well below historical levels because of hake [[Resource depletion|depletion]] in the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]]. However, different factors might have caused this decline, including a too-high [[Total Allowable Catch|Total Annual Catch]], unsustainable fishing, [[ecology|ecological]] problems, juvenile catches, or non-registered catches.

According to the [[Worldwide Fund for Nature]], the only hake species not currently{{when|date=February 2020}} over-fished is [[Cape hake]], found off [[Namibia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wwf.de/themen/meere-kuesten/fischerei/wwf-fischfuehrer/ |title=WWF-Deutschland: Einkaufsratgeber Fische &amp; Meeresfrüchte |publisher=Wwf.de |accessdate=2010-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005172159/http://www.wwf.de/themen/meere-kuesten/fischerei/wwf-fischfuehrer/ |archivedate=2008-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Namibia is the only country that has increased its hake quota, from {{convert|130,000|t}} in 2009 to {{convert|145,000|t}} in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=28&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=65437&amp;no_cache=1&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Namibian [[ministry of fisheries]] adheres to very strict rules regarding the catch of hake. For example, the closed seasons for hake lasts approximately two months, in September and October, depending on the level of stock. This rule has been applied to ensure the regrowth of the hake population. Supplemental restrictions forbid [[trawling]] for Hake in waters less than {{convert|200|m|ft|0}} deep (to avoid damaging non-target species [[natural habitat|habitat]]) and to minimize [[by-catch]].

==Human introduction to non-native areas==
[[Frank Forrester]]'s ''[[Fishermens' Guide]]'' in 1885 mentions a hake that was transplanted from the coast of [[Ireland]] to [[Cape Cod]] on the coast of [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States]].  It is uncertain which species it was, but the ''Fishermens′ Guide'' stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;This is an Irish [[Seawater|salt water]] fish, similar in appearance to the [[Microgadus tomcod|tom cod]]. In [[Galway Bay|Galway bay]], and other sea [[inlet]]s of Ireland, the hake is exceedingly abundant, and is taken in great numbers. It is also found in [[England]] and [[France]]. Since the [[Irish Americans|Irish immigration]] to America, the hake has followed in the wake of their masters, as it is now found in [[New York Bay|New York bay]], in the waters around [[Boston]], and off Cape Cod. Here it is called the stock fish, and the Bostonians call them poor Johns. It is a singular fact that until within a few years this fish was never seen in America. It does not grow as large here as in Europe, though here they are from ten to eighteen inches [250 to 460 mm] in length. The general color of this fish is a reddish brown, with some golden tints—the sides being of a pink silvery luster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Frank Forrester's Fishermens' Guide|url=http://chestofbooks.com/outdoors/fishing/Fishermen-Guide/index.html|last=Forrester|first=Frank|authorlink=Frank Forester|publisher=Advance Publishing Company|location=New York|year=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{short description|Index of marine fish with the same common name}}
'''Sea bass''' is a [[common name]] for a variety of different species of [[Saltwater fish|marine fish]]. Many fish species of various families have been called sea bass.

In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the United Kingdom, the fish sold and consumed as sea bass is exclusively the [[European bass]], ''Dicentrarchus labrax''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SBIND&quot;&gt;

The '''white bass''', '''silver bass''', or '''sand bass''' (''Morone chrysops'') is a [[freshwater]] fish of the temperate bass family [[Moronidae]]. It is the [[state fish]] of [[Oklahoma]].

== Range ==
White bass are distributed widely across the United States, particularly in the Midwest.  They are very abundant in Pennsylvania and the area around Lake Erie.  Some native ranges of the white bass are the Arkansas River, western Lake Erie, the Detroit River, and Lake Poinsett in South Dakota; they are abundant in the Winnebago lakes system of Wisconsin; and they are also very abundant in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David W. Willis |author2=Craig P. Partaker |author3=Brian G. Blackwell |title=Biology of White Bass in Eastern South Dakota Glacial Lakes|journal=North American Journal of Fisheries Management|date=May 2002|volume=22|issue=2|pages=627–636|doi=10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022&lt;0627:Bobbie&gt;2.0.co;2|doi-broken-date=2020-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  White bass have also been found in rivers that flow to the Mississippi.   Native to many northern habitats, they have been introduced in many different waters around the United States, particularly in southern locations.  They were also successfully introduced to Manitoba starting in the 1960s, where they have gained importance as a sport fish.

== Description ==
[[File:White Bass, Caught and Released.JPG|thumb|left|A white bass, caught in [[Grosse Pointe Woods]], MI.]]
The species' main color is silver-white to pale green.  Its back is dark, with white sides and belly, and with narrow dark stripes running lengthwise on its sides. It has large, rough scales and two dorsal fins.  The more anterior dorsal fin is much harder and appears to have spines on them.  Although these are not true spines, this type of fin is called a spinous ray.  The more posterior of the two dorsal fins is much softer, and is thus called a soft-ray.  Because the vertebrae do not extend into the tail, the white bass has what is called a homocercal tail.  The body is deep and compressed laterally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temperate Basses|url=http://www.fish.state.pa.us/pafish/fishhtms/chap21.htm|work=Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission|publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most grow to a length between {{convert|10|and|12|in|cm}}, though they can reach {{convert|17|in|cm}} or more.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Because the dorsal and ventral portions of its tail angle inward toward a point to create a clear angle, the tail is said to be notched.

The record size for white bass caught on fishing tackle is {{convert|6|lb|13|oz|kg}} shared by fish caught in 1989 in Orange Lake, [[Orange, Virginia]], and in 2010 in Amite River, [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc+AllTackle&amp;cn=Bass, white, accessed 27 Mar 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
White bass are  carnivores. They have four main taxa in their diet: [[Calanoida|calanoid copepods]], [[Cyclopoida|cyclopoid copepods]], [[daphnia]], and [[leptodora]].&lt;ref name=&quot;web.ebscohost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=W.J. Eckmayer |author2=F.J. Margraf |title=The influence of diet, consumption, and lipid use on recruitment of white bass|journal=Lakes and Reservoirs: Research and Management|date=June 2004|volume=9|issue=2|pages=133–141|doi=10.1111/j.1320-5331.2004.00239.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are visual feeders. When not frightened, they will bite readily at live [[bait (luring substance)|bait]] such as [[Earthworm|worms]] and [[Leuciscinae|minnow]]s.  Only the largest fish will feed on other fish, and as the summer season progresses, there is an overall trend towards eating fewer fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;web.ebscohost.com&quot;/&gt;  Fish that are able to accumulate lipids over the summer are better able to survive cold winters.  When looking at midwestern white bass, particularly in South Dakota, diet overlap occurs between the bass and the walleye.  As seasons progress through the summer and fall, the amount of diet overlap decreases as a result of both fish increasing in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D.W. Willis |author2=C.P.

==Habitat==
White bass inhabit large reservoirs and rivers.  When mating in the spring, they are more often found in shallow rivers, creeks, and streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Weekend Angler|url=http://texasweekendangler.com/texas_freshwater_fish.htm|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  White bass are found in high densities in the upstream segment of rivers.  This portion of the river becomes the most degraded, as a number of different kinds of fish live in this segment, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.W.R Lapointe |author2=L.D.

==Reproduction==
The spawning season for the white bass is mid-March to late May.  The optimal water temperatures are {{convert|12|to|20|C}}.   They are known to find their home spawning ground even if it is moved to a different part of the same lake.&lt;ref name=WISeaGrantInstitute&gt;[http://seagrant.wisc.edu/greatlakesfish/fwhitebass1.html University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute]; February 2, 2006; Retrieved June 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They often [[spawn (biology)|spawn]] in moving water in a [[tributary]] stream, but they will spawn in windswept lake shores.&lt;ref name=WISeaGrantInstitute /&gt; They spawn during daylight.

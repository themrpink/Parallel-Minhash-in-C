== Types of scramblers ==
* Additive  (synchronous) scramblers
* Multiplicative (self-synchronizing) scramblers

=== Additive (synchronous) scramblers ===
[[File:Scrambler randomizer additive.png|right|thumb|350px|An additive scrambler (descrambler) used in [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]]]

''Additive scramblers'' (they are also referred to as ''synchronous'') transform the input data stream by applying a [[pseudo-random binary sequence]] (PRBS) (by modulo-two addition). Sometimes a pre-calculated PRBS stored in the [[read-only memory]] is used, but more often it is generated by a [[linear-feedback shift register]] (LFSR).

In order to assure a synchronous operation of the transmitting and receiving LFSR (that is, ''scrambler'' and ''descrambler''), a ''[[sync-word]]'' must be used.

A sync-word is a pattern that is placed in the data stream through equal intervals (that is, in each [[Data frame|frame]]). A receiver searches for a few sync-words in adjacent frames and hence determines the place when its LFSR must be reloaded with a pre-defined ''initial state''.

The ''additive descrambler'' is just the same device as the additive scrambler.

Additive scrambler/descrambler is defined by the polynomial of its LFSR (for the scrambler on the picture above, it is &lt;math&gt;1+z^{-14}+z^{-15}&lt;/math&gt;) and its ''initial state''.

=== Multiplicative (self-synchronizing) scramblers ===

[[File:Scrambler randomizer multiplicative descrambler.png|right|thumb|350px|A multiplicative descrambler used in V.34 recommendation]]

''Multiplicative scramblers'' (also known as ''feed-through'') are called so because they perform a ''multiplication'' of the input signal by the scrambler's [[transfer function]] in [[Z-transform|Z-space]]. They are discrete [[LTI system|linear time-invariant]] systems.
A multiplicative scrambler is recursive, and a multiplicative descrambler is non-recursive. Unlike additive scramblers, multiplicative scramblers do not need the frame synchronization, that is why they are also called ''self-synchronizing''. Multiplicative scrambler/descrambler is defined similarly by a polynomial (for the scrambler on the picture it is &lt;math&gt;1+z^{-18}+z^{-23}&lt;/math&gt;), which is also a ''transfer function'' of the descrambler.

=== Comparison of scramblers ===
Scramblers have certain drawbacks: 
* Both types may fail to generate random sequences under worst-case input conditions. 
* Multiplicative scramblers lead to error multiplication during descrambling (i.e. a single-bit error at the descrambler's input will result in ''w'' errors at its output, where ''w'' equals the number of the scrambler's feedback taps). 
* Additive scramblers must be reset by the frame sync; if this fails, massive error propagation will result, as a complete frame cannot be descrambled. 
* The effective length of the random sequence of an additive scrambler is limited by the frame length, which is normally much shorter than the period of the PRBS. By adding frame numbers to the frame sync, it is possible to extend the length of the random sequence, by varying the random sequence in accordance with the frame number.

==Noise==
The first voice scramblers were invented at [[Bell Labs]] in the period just before [[World War II]]. These sets consisted of electronics that could mix two signals or alternatively &quot;subtract&quot; one signal back out again. The two signals were provided by a [[telephone]] and a [[record player]]. A matching pair of records was produced, each containing the same recording of [[noise]]. The recording was played into the telephone, and the mixed signal was sent over the wire. The noise was then subtracted out at the far end using the matching record, leaving the original voice signal intact. Eavesdroppers would hear only the noisy signal, unable to understand the voice.

One of those, used (among other duties) for telephone conversations between [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was intercepted and unscrambled by the [[Germans]]. At least one German [[engineer]] had worked at Bell Labs before the war and came up with a way to break them. Later versions were sufficiently different that the German team was unable to unscramble them. Early versions were known as &quot;[[A-3 (scrambler)|A-3]]&quot; (from [[AT&amp;T Corporation]]). An unrelated device called [[SIGSALY]] was used for higher-level voice communications.

The noise was provided on large shellac [[phonograph]] records made in pairs, shipped as needed, and destroyed after use. This worked, but was enormously awkward. Just achieving synchronization of the two records proved difficult. Post-war electronics made such systems much easier to work with by creating pseudo-random noise based on a short input tone. In use, the caller would play a tone into the phone, and both scrambler units would then listen to the signal and synchronize to it. This provided limited security, however, as any listener with a basic knowledge of the electronic circuitry could often produce a machine of similar-enough settings to break into the communications.

==Cryptographic==
It was the need to synchronize the scramblers that suggested to [[James H. Ellis]] the idea for [[non-secret encryption]], which ultimately led to the invention of both the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] encryption algorithm and [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]] well before either was reinvented publicly by [[Ron Rivest|Rivest]], [[Adi Shamir|Shamir]], and [[Leonard Adleman|Adleman]], or by [[Whitfield Diffie|Diffie]] and [[Martin Hellman|Hellman]].

The latest scramblers are not scramblers in the truest sense of the word, but rather [[Digitizing|digitizers]] combined with encryption machines. In these systems the original signal is first converted into digital form, and then the digital data is encrypted and sent. Using modern [[Public-key cryptography|public-key systems]], these &quot;scramblers&quot; are much more [[Security|secure]] than their earlier analog counterparts. Only these types of systems are considered secure enough for sensitive data.

[[Voice inversion]] scrambling can be as simple as inverting the [[Frequency range|frequency bands]] around a static point to various complex methods of changing the inversion point randomly and in real time and using multiple bands.

The &quot;scramblers&quot; used in [[cable television]] are designed to prevent casual signal theft, not to provide any real security. Early versions of these devices simply &quot;inverted&quot; one important component of the TV signal, re-inverting it at the client end for display. Later devices were only slightly more complex, filtering out that component entirely and then adding it by examining other portions of the signal. In both cases the circuitry could be easily built by any reasonably knowledgeable hobbyist.  (See [[Television encryption]].)

Electronic kits for scrambling and descrambling are available from hobbyist suppliers. [[Scanner (radio)|Scanner]] enthusiasts often use them to listen in to scrambled communications at car races and some public-service transmissions. It is also common in [[Family Radio Service|FRS]] radios.  This is an easy way to learn about scrambling.

The term &quot;scrambling&quot; is sometimes incorrectly used when [[Radio jamming|jamming]] is meant.

== Descramble ==
'''Descramble''' in [[cable television]] context is the act of taking a scrambled or [[encrypted]] video signal that has been provided by a cable television company for [[premium television]] services, processed by a scrambler and then supplied over a [[coaxial cable]] and delivered to the household where a [[set-top box]] reprocesses the signal, thus descrambling it and making it available for viewing on the [[television]] set. A descrambler is a device that restores the picture and sound of a scrambled channel. A descrambler must be used with a [[cable converter box]] to be able to unencrypt all of the premium &amp; pay-per-view channels of a Cable Television System.

In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''secondary frequency standard''' is a [[frequency standard]] that does not have inherent [[accuracy]], and therefore must be calibrated against a [[primary standard|primary frequency standard]]. 

Secondary standards include [[crystal oscillator]]s and [[rubidium standard]]s. A crystal oscillator depends for its frequency on its physical dimensions, which vary with fabrication and environmental conditions. A [[rubidium standard]] is a secondary standard even though it uses atomic transitions, because it takes the form of a gas cell through which an optical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] is passed. The gas cell has inherent inaccuracies because of gas pressure variations, including those induced by temperature variations. There are also variations in the concentrations of the required buffer gases, which variations cause frequency deviations.

{{short description|Degree of resistance to, or protection from, harm}}
[[File:&quot;WAAC - SILENCE MEANS SECURITY&quot; - NARA - 515987.tif|thumb|[[Women's Army Corps]] (1941–1945) associated [[national security]] with avoiding conversations about war work.]]'''Security''' is freedom from, or resilience against, [[potential]] harm (or other unwanted [[Coercion|coercive]] change) caused by others. Beneficiaries (technically [[referent]]s) of security may be of persons and social groups, objects and institutions, ecosystems or any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change. 
[[File:20151030 Syrians and Iraq refugees arrive at Skala Sykamias Lesvos Greece 2.jpg|thumb|[[Refugee]]s fleeing war and insecurity in Iraq and Syria arrive at [[Lesbos Island]], supported by Spanish volunteers, 2015]]
Security mostly refers to protection from hostile forces, but it has a wide range of other senses: for example, as the absence of harm (e.g. [[freedom from want]]); as the presence of an essential good (e.g. [[food security]]); as [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]] against potential damage or harm (e.g. secure foundations); as secrecy (e.g. a [[Telephone tapping|secure telephone line]]); as containment (e.g. a secure room or [[Prison cell|cell]]); and as a state of mind (e.g. [[emotional security]]).

The term is also used to refer to acts and systems whose purpose may be to provide security (e.g.: [[security companies]], [[security forces]], [[security guard]], [[Computer security|cyber security systems]], [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]], [[remote guarding]]).

== Etymology ==
The word 'secure' entered the English language in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; It is derived from Latin ''securus'', meaning freedom from anxiety: ''se'' (without) + ''cura'' (care, anxiety).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/secure|title=Origin and meaning of secure|last=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

===Referent ===
A security [[referent]] is the focus of a security policy or discourse; for example, a referent may be a potential beneficiary (or victim) of a security policy or system.

Security referents may be persons or social groups, objects, institutions, ecosystems, or any other phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change by the forces of its environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Barry Buzan, Ole Wæver, and Jaap de Wilde, ''Security: A New Framework for Analysis'' (Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1998), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The referent in question may combine many referents, in the same way that, for example, a nation state is composed of many individual citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rethinkingsecurityorguk.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/rethinking-security-a-discussion-paper.pdf|title=Rethinking Security: A discussion paper|last=Gee|first=D|date=2016|website=rethinkingsecurity.org.uk|publisher=Ammerdown Group|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Context ===
The security context is the relationships between a security referent and its environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; From this perspective, security and insecurity depend first on whether the environment is beneficial or hostile to the referent, and also how capable is the referent of responding to its/their environment in order to survive and thrive.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

=== Capabilities ===
The means by which a referent provides for security (or is provided for) vary widely. They include, for example:
* ''Coercive capabilities'', including the capacity to project coercive power into the environment (e.g. [[aircraft carrier]], [[handgun]], [[firearms]]);
* ''Protective systems'' (e.g. [[Lock (security device)|lock]], [[fence]], [[wall]], [[antivirus software]], [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence system]], [[armour]])
* ''Warning systems'' (e.g. alarm, [[radar]])
* ''Diplomatic and social action'' intended to prevent insecurity from developing (e.g. [[Conflict transformation|conflict prevention and transformation]] strategies); and
* ''Policy'' intended to develop the lasting economic, physical, ecological and other conditions of security (e.g. [[Economics|economic]] reform, [[Ecology|ecological]] protection, [[Demilitarisation|progressive demilitarization]], [[militarization]]).

=== Effects ===
Any action intended to provide security may have multiple effects. For example, an action may have wide benefit, enhancing security for several or all security referents in the context; alternatively, the action may be effective only temporarily, or benefit one referent at the expense of another, or be entirely ineffective or counterproductive.

=== Contested approaches ===
Approaches to security are contested and the subject of debate. For example, in debate about [[National security|national security strategies]], some argue that security depends principally on developing protective and coercive capabilities in order to protect the security referent in a hostile environment (and potentially to project that power into its environment, and dominate it to the point of [[Full-spectrum dominance|strategic supremacy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45289|title=Joint Vision 2020 Emphasizes Full-spectrum Dominance|last=US, Department of Defense|date=2000|website=archive.defense.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmdfence/512/51202.htm|title=Re-thinking defence to meet new threats|last=House of Commons Defence Committee|date=2015|website=publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/building-a-british-military-fit-for-future-challenges-rather-than-past-conflicts|title=Building a British military fit for future challenges rather than past conflicts|last=General Sir Nicholas Houghton|date=2015|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that security depends principally on building the conditions in which equitable relationships can develop, partly by reducing antagonism between actors, ensuring that fundamental needs can be met, and also that differences of interest can be negotiated effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcnl.org/updates/peace-through-shared-security-79|title=Peace Through Shared Security|last=FCNL|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Losing control : global security in the twenty-first century|last=Rogers|first=P|date=2010|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=9780745329376|edition=3rd|location=London|pages=|oclc=658007519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms “surveillance” and “reconnaissance” have sometimes been used interchangeably, but, in the military context, a distinction can be drawn between surveillance, which monitors a changing situation in real time, and [[reconnaissance]], which captures a static picture for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gates|first=J.W.C|date=December 2002|title=Surveillance and reconnaissance imaging systems—modelling and performance prediction|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0143-8166(01)00180-4|journal=Optics and Lasers in Engineering|volume=38|issue=6|pages=607–608|doi=10.1016/s0143-8166(01)00180-4|issn=0143-8166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveillance is sometimes grouped with [[Intelligence gathering|Intelligence]], [[Target acquisition]] and [[Reconnaissance]] under the title [[ISTAR]].

Observation was the term used for surveillance when the main sensor was the human eye.

==History==

===Pre World War I===
[[Image:Early flight 02562u (9).jpg|thumb|right|The first surveillance balloon, ''&quot;l'Entreprenant&quot;'', 1794. Illustration from the late 19th Century.]]
{{Main|History of military ballooning}}
In 1794, during the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]], the [[French Aerostatic Corps]] balloon ''L'Entreprenant'' remained afloat for nine hours.  French officers used the balloon to observe the movements of the Austrian Army, dropping notes to the ground for collection by the French Army,&lt;ref name=&quot;haydon&quot;&gt;F. Stansbury Haydon, ''Military Ballooning During the Early Civil War'', pp. 5–15.&lt;/ref&gt; and also signalled messages using [[semaphore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coulston&quot;&gt;Charles Coulston Gillispie, ''Science and Polity in France: The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Years'', pp. 372–373.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
One of the first aircraft used for surveillance was the [[Rumpler Taube]] during [[World War I]], when aviators like [[Fred Zinn]] evolved entirely new methods of reconnaissance and photography.  The translucent wings of the plane made it very difficult for ground-based observers to detect a Taube at an altitude above 400 m.  The French also called this plane &quot;the Invisible Aircraft&quot;, and it is sometimes also referred to as the &quot;world's very first stealth plane&quot;.  German Taube aircraft were able to detect the advancing Russian army during the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)]].

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], [[light aircraft]] such as the [[Taylorcraft Auster|Auster]] were used as air [[observation post]]s.  Officers from the British [[Royal Artillery]] were trained as pilots to fly [[Air Observation Post|AOP]] aircraft for [[artillery spotting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warplane.com/pages/aircraft_beagle.html Canadian Warplane Heritage: Auster Beagle AOP]&lt;/ref&gt;
The air observation role was generally taken over by light [[observation helicopter]]s, such as the [[Hughes OH-6 Cayuse]], from the mid-1960s.

Pre war, the British identified a need for an aircraft that could follow and observe the enemy fleet at a distance. To this end the slow-flying [[Airspeed Fleet Shadower]] and [[General Aircraft Fleet Shadower]] designs were built and flown in 1940 but they were made obsolete by the introduction of airborne radar.

===Cold War===
Spy flights were a source of major contention between the US and [[Soviet Union]] during most of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Reds, U.S. Face Hot Plane Debate at U.N. | work=The Paris News | date=May 23, 1960 | agency=Associated Press  | location=Paris, Texas (US) | pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Maritime patrol aircraft}}

[[Maritime patrol aircraft]] are typically large, slow machines capable of flying continuously for many hours, with a wide range of sensors. Such aircraft include the [[Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod]], the [[Breguet Atlantique]], the [[Tupolev Tu-95]], the [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune]] and the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]]/[[Lockheed CP-140 Aurora|CP-140 Aurora]]. Smaller ship-launched [[observation seaplane]]s were used from World War I through World War II.

===Law enforcement===

'''Barry Took''' (19 June 1928{{snd}}31 March 2002) was an English writer, television presenter and comedian. His decade and a half writing partnership with [[Marty Feldman]] led to the television series ''[[Bootsie and Snudge]]'' and the radio comedy ''[[Round the Horne]]'' and other projects.

He is also remembered in the UK for presenting ''[[Points of View (TV series)|Points of View]]'', a [[BBC Television]] programme featuring viewers' letters on the [[BBC]]'s output,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Early life and education==
The son of a manager at the Danish Bacon Company, Took was born in Victoria Road, [[Muswell Hill]],&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite news| first= Douglas |last= Martin |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/14/nyregion/barry-took-73-father-of-monty-python-dies.html |title= Barry Took, 73, Father of Monty Python, Dies| work= [[The New York Times]]| date= 14 April 2002| accessdate= 1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotsman /&gt; [[north London]] and lived in Winton Avenue, Bounds Green. When he was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to [[Wisbech]] in Cambridgeshire during the Second World War, he ran away from his assigned home there, cycling 20 miles to Peterborough to get a train back to London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1389535/Barry-Took.html Obituary: Barry Took], ''The Telegraph'', 2 April 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Stationers' Company's School|Stationers School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =Gifford | first =Dennis | title =Barry Took | work = The Independent | date =1 April 2002 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/barry-took-729876.html | accessdate =24 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but left at age 15.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; His older brother Philip would eventually work for the US Space Program before dying as a young man.&lt;ref name=Scotsman /&gt;

==Career==
With his limited education, Took found work as an office boy for a publisher and a cinema projectionist.&lt;ref name=Scotsman /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt; During his period of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|National Service]] in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in which he played the trumpet,&lt;ref name=Scotsman /&gt; he began performing and later worked as a stand-up comedian, eventually becoming a West End [[revue]] performer, working on ''[[For Amusement Only]]'' and ''[[For Adults Only (revue)|For Adults Only]]''.

In terms of his comedy writing, Took's best work was written in collaboration with [[Marty Feldman]], whom he first met in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;&gt;John Oliver [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/532391/ &quot;Took, Barry (1928–2002)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; The two men wrote for several television shows in the 1950s and '60s, including ''[[The Army Game]]'' and its spin-off ''[[Bootsie and Snudge]]''. He co-wrote ''[[Beyond Our Ken]]'' for two series (1958–59) with [[Eric Merriman]] for BBC Radio before leaving after a disagreement with his fellow writer. With [[Marty Feldman]] he wrote most episodes of ''[[Round the Horne]]''; the intermittent partnership between them continued until 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt;

In the late 1960s Took became comedy advisor to the BBC and was responsible for bringing together the performers who formed ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', before moving to the United States to work briefly on ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh In]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt; He returned to the UK in early 1970, was involved in setting up the BBC series ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', although he had returned to take up the position of Head of Light Entertainment at [[London Weekend Television]]. He resigned from this position when [[Stella Richman]], his superior and the Director of Programming, was dismissed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt; ''[[On the Move (TV series)|On the Move]]'' (1975–76), a programme linked to a national campaign to promote adult literacy, was written by Took and featured [[Bob Hoskins]] and Donald Gee. He was involved in two further television series on the issue, ''Your Move'' and ''Write Away''.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1389535/Barry-Took.html| work= The Telegraph | title= Barry Took| date= 2 April 2002 | accessdate= 1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Took hosted his own comedy sketch show, ''Took and Co''. Also featuring [[Robin Bailey]], [[Chris Emmett]], [[Andrew Sachs]] and [[Gwen Taylor]], the series ran for seven episodes late at night on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

In 1979 he became chairman of ''[[The News Quiz]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]], a role he filled until 1981 and again from 1986 to 1995. In the same year he became a presenter of ''[[Points of View (TV series)|Points of View]]'', staying with the programme for 7½ years.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

Took also hosted the [[BBC Radio 2]] comedy panel game ''The Impressionists'', which included [[Peter Goodwright]], [[Roger Kitter]], [[David Jason]] and Dave Evans and, in 1998, the single-season revival of ''[[Twenty Questions]]'' titled ''Guess What?''.

He had seven books published, including his autobiography and several histories of comedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt; He also wrote [[Kenneth Williams]]'s life story for the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life and final years==
During his time with the Royal Air Force he met his first wife, Dorothy &quot;Dot&quot; Bird, who was serving in the [[Women's Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; They married in 1950&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt; and had three children (Barry, Susan and David), but were later divorced.

'''George V''' (George Frederick Ernest Albert; 3 June 1865&amp;nbsp;– 20 January 1936) was [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]], and [[Emperor of India]], from 6 May 1910 until his death in 1936.

Born during the reign of his grandmother [[Queen Victoria]], George was third in the [[succession to the British throne|line of succession]] behind his father, [[Prince Albert Edward]], and his own elder brother, [[Prince Albert Victor]]. From 1877 to 1892, George served in the [[Royal Navy]], until the unexpected death of his elder brother in early 1892 put him directly in line for the throne. On the death of Victoria in 1901, George's father ascended the throne as Edward VII, and George was created [[Prince of Wales]]. He became [[king-emperor]] on his father's death in 1910.

George V's reign saw the rise of [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[fascism]], [[Irish republicanism]], and the [[Indian independence movement]], all of which radically changed the political landscape of the [[British Empire]]. The [[Parliament Act 1911]] established the supremacy of the elected [[British House of Commons]] over the unelected [[House of Lords]]. As a result of the [[First World War]] (1914–1918), the empires of his first cousins [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Wilhelm II of Germany]] fell, while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the [[House of Windsor]], which he renamed from the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] as a result of anti-German public sentiment. 

In 1924 he appointed the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[First MacDonald ministry|ministry]] and in 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate, independent states within the [[British Commonwealth of Nations]]. He had smoking-related health problems throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Edward VIII]].

==Early life and education==
George was born on 3 June 1865, in [[Marlborough House]], London. He was the second son of [[Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]], and [[Alexandra, Princess of Wales]]. His father was the eldest son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], and his mother was the eldest daughter of [[King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]]. He was baptised at [[Windsor Castle]] on 7 July 1865 by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Charles Longley]].&lt;ref&gt;His godparents were the [[George V of Hanover|King of Hanover]] (Queen Victoria's cousin, for whom [[Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] stood proxy); the [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (Prince Albert's brother, for whom the [[Lord President of the Council]], [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Earl Granville]], stood proxy); the [[Ernst Leopold, 4th Prince of Leiningen|Prince of Leiningen]] (the Prince of Wales's half-cousin); the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]] (the Princess of Wales's brother, for whom the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney|Viscount Sydney]], stood proxy); the [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen of Denmark]] (George's maternal grandmother, for whom Queen Victoria stood proxy); the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's cousin); the [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|Duchess of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's aunt, for whom George's aunt [[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Princess Helena]] stood proxy); and [[Princess Louis of Hesse and by Rhine]] (George's aunt, for whom her sister [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] stood proxy) (''The Times'' (London), Saturday, 8 July 1865, p. 12).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a younger son of the Prince of Wales, there was little expectation that George would become king. He was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother, [[Prince Albert Victor]]. George was only 17&amp;nbsp;months younger than Albert Victor, and the two princes were educated together. [[John Neale Dalton]] was appointed as their tutor in 1871. Neither Albert Victor nor George excelled intellectually.&lt;ref&gt;Clay, p. 39; Sinclair, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; As their father thought that the navy was &quot;the very best possible training for any boy&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; in September 1877, when George was 12&amp;nbsp;years old, both brothers joined the cadet training ship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS ''Britannia'']] at [[Dartmouth, Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;Clay, p. 71; Rose, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of collaboration===
Groupware can be divided into three categories depending on the level of [[collaboration]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |title=Groupware - Communication, Collaboration and Coordination |publisher=Lotus Development Corporation |year=1995 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713051554/http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |archive-date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casalino N., Draoli M. (2009), “Governance and Organizational Aspects of an Experimental Groupware in the Italian Public Administration to Support Multi-Institutional Partnerships”, in Information Systems: People, Organizations, Institutions, and Trchnologies, D’Atri A., Saccà D. (Eds.), Physica-Verlag, Springer, Heidelberg, Germany, pp. 81-89, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2147-5}}, doi 10.1007/978-3-7908-2148-2_11&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Communication''' can be thought of as unstructured interchange of information. A phone call or an [[Instant Messaging|IM]] Chat discussion are examples of this.
# '''Conferencing''' (or collaboration level, as it is called in the academic papers that discuss these levels) refers to interactive work toward a shared goal. Brainstorming or voting are examples of this.
# '''Co-ordination''' refers to complex interdependent work toward a shared goal. A good metaphor for understanding this is to think about a sports team; everyone has to contribute the right play at the right time as well as adjust their play to the unfolding situation - but everyone is doing something different - in order for the team to win. That is complex interdependent work toward a shared goal: collaborative management.

===Collaborative management (coordination) tools===
Collaborative management tools facilitate and manage group activities. Examples include:
* [[Electronic calendar]]s (also called [[time management]] software) &amp;mdash; schedule events and automatically notify and remind group members
* [[Project management]] systems &amp;mdash; schedule, track, and chart the steps in a project as it is being completed
* [[Online proofing]] &amp;mdash; share, review, approve, and reject web proofs, artwork, photos, or videos between designers, customers, and clients
* [[Workflow system]]s &amp;mdash; collaborative management of tasks and documents within a knowledge-based business process
* [[Knowledge management software|Knowledge management systems]] &amp;mdash; collect, organize, manage, and share various forms of information
* [[Enterprise bookmarking]] &amp;mdash; collaborative bookmarking engine to tag, organize, share, and search enterprise data
* [[Prediction market]]s &amp;mdash; let a group of people predict together the outcome of future events
* [[Extranet]] systems (sometimes also known as 'project extranets') &amp;mdash; collect, organize, manage and share information associated with the delivery of a project (e.g.: the construction of a building)
* [[Intranet]] systems &amp;mdash; quickly share company information to members within a company via Internet (e.g.: marketing and product info)&lt;ref name=&quot;Intranet&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaffey|first1=Dave|title=Groupware, Workflow, and Intranets: Reengineering the Enterprise with Collaborative Software|date=1998|publisher=Digital Press|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Social software]] systems &amp;mdash; organize social relations of groups
* [[Online spreadsheet]]s &amp;mdash; collaborate and share structured data and information
* [[Client portal]]s &amp;mdash; interact and share with your clients in a private online environment{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Collaborative software and human interaction==
{{essay|section|date=September 2020}}
The design intent of collaborative software (groupware) is to transform the way documents and [[rich media]] are shared in order to enable more effective team collaboration.

Collaboration, with respect to information technology, seems to have several definitions. Some are defensible but others are so broad they lose any meaningful application. Understanding the differences in human interactions is necessary to ensure the appropriate technologies are employed to meet interaction needs.

There are three primary ways in which humans interact: conversations, transactions, and collaborations.

''Conversational interaction'' is an exchange of information between two or more participants where the primary purpose of the interaction is discovery or relationship building. There is no central entity around which the interaction revolves but is a free exchange of information with no defined constraints, generally focused on personal experiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;iSchool&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunbar|first1=R. I.|last2=Marriott|first2=A.|last3=Duncan|first3=N. D.|title=Human conversational behavior|journal=Human Nature : An Interdisciplinary Biosocial Perspective|date=1997|volume=8|issue=3|pages=231–246|doi=10.1007/BF02912493|accessdate=3 December 2014|url=http://medisch-fitness.com/documents/75procentdagelijksegesprekkenbestedenweaanroddelen.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141124125602/http://medisch-fitness.com/documents/75procentdagelijksegesprekkenbestedenweaanroddelen.pdf|archive-date=24 November 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication technology such as telephones, [[instant messaging]], and e-mail are generally sufficient for conversational interactions.

''Transactional interaction'' involves the exchange of transaction entities where a major function of the transaction entity is to alter the relationship between participants.

In ''collaborative interactions'' the main function of the participants' relationship is to alter a collaboration entity (i.e., the converse of transactional). When teams collaborate on projects it is called [[Collaborative project management]].

In tribute to him, the number of elementary entities ([[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, [[ion]]s or other particles) in 1 [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance, {{val|6.02214076e23}}, is known as the [[Avogadro constant]], one of the seven [[SI]] base units and represented by ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Biography==
Amedeo Avogadro was born in [[Turin]] to a noble family of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (now part of [[Italy]]) in the year 1776. He graduated in [[ecclesiastical law]] at the late age of 20 and began to practice. Soon after, he dedicated himself to [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] (then called ''positive philosophy''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aglio |first1=Linda S. |last2=Litvak |first2=Eva A. |last3=Desai |first3=Sukumar P. |title=History of anaesthesia |journal=European Journal of Anaesthesiology |date=January 2016 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |doi=10.1097/EJA.0000000000000356|pmid=26627677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1809 started teaching them at a ''liceo'' (high school) in [[Vercelli]], where his family lived and had some property.

In 1811, he published an article with the title ''Essai d'une manière de déterminer les masses relatives des molécules élémentaires des corps, et les proportions selon lesquelles elles entrent dans ces combinaisons'' (&quot;Essay on a manner  of Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies and the Proportions by Which They Enter These Combinations&quot;), which contains Avogadro's hypothesis. Avogadro submitted this essay to [[Jean-Claude Delamétherie]]'s ''Journal de Physique, de Chimie et d'Histoire naturelle'' (&quot;Journal of Physics, Chemistry and Natural History&quot;).

In 1820, he became a professor of physics at the University of Turin. Turin was now the capital of  the restored Savoyard [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] under [[Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia|Victor Emmanuel I]]. Avogadro was active in the [[Piedmont insurrection|revolutionary movement]] of March 1821. As a result, he lost his chair in 1823 (or, as the university officially declared, it was &quot;very glad to allow this interesting scientist to take a rest from heavy teaching duties, in order to be able to give better attention to his researches&quot;). Eventually, King [[Charles Albert of Savoy|Charles Albert]] granted a Constitution (''[[Statuto Albertino]]'') in 1848. Well before this, Avogadro had been recalled to the university in Turin in 1833, where he taught for another twenty years.

Little is known about Avogadro's private life, which appears to have been sober and religious. He married Felicita Mazzé and had six children.{{Dubious |Number of kids |reason=Some sources say seven kids and some say six. |date=March 2016}} Avogadro held posts dealing with statistics, meteorology, and weights and measures (he introduced the [[metric system]] into Piedmont) and was a member of the Royal Superior Council on Public Instruction.

He died on 9 July 1856.

==Accomplishments==

In honor of Avogadro's contributions to molecular theory, the number of molecules per mole of substance is named the &quot;[[Avogadro constant]]&quot;, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. It is exactly {{physconst|NA|after=.}}  The Avogadro constant is used to compute the results of chemical reactions. It allows chemists to determine the amounts of substances produced in a given reaction to a great degree of accuracy.

[[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] first calculated the value of the Avogadro constant, the number of particles in one mole, sometimes referred to as the Loschmidt number in German-speaking countries ([[Loschmidt constant]] now has another meaning).

[[Avogadro's Law]] states that the relationship between the masses of the same volume of all gases (at the same temperature and pressure) corresponds to the relationship between their respective molecular weights. Hence, the relative molecular mass of a gas can be calculated from the mass of a sample of known volume.

Avogadro developed this hypothesis after [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] published his law on volumes (and combining gases) in 1808. The greatest problem Avogadro had to resolve was the confusion at that time regarding atoms and molecules. One of his most important contributions was clearly distinguishing one from the other, stating that gases are composed of molecules, and these molecules are composed of atoms. (For instance, [[John Dalton]] did not consider this possibility.) Avogadro did not actually use the word &quot;atom&quot; as the words &quot;atom&quot; and &quot;molecule&quot; were used almost without difference. He believed that there were three kinds of &quot;molecules,&quot; including an &quot;elementary molecule&quot; (our &quot;atom&quot;). Also, he gave more attention to the definition of [[mass]], as distinguished from [[weight]].

[[File:Avogadro - Mémoire sur les chaleurs spécifiques des corps solides et liquides, 1833 - 6060053 TOAS005003 00003.tif|thumb|''Mémoire'']]
In 1815, he published ''Mémoire sur les masses relatives des molécules des corps simples, ou densités présumées de leur gaz, et sur la constitution de quelques-uns de leur composés, pour servir de suite à l'Essai sur le même sujet, publié dans le Journal de Physique, juillet 1811'' (&quot;Note on the Relative Masses of Elementary Molecules, or Suggested Densities of Their Gases, and on the Constituents of Some of Their Compounds, As a Follow-up to the Essay on the Same Subject, Published in the Journal of Physics, July 1811&quot;) about gas densities.

In 1821 he published another paper, ''Nouvelles considérations sur la théorie des proportions déterminées dans les combinaisons, et sur la détermination des masses des molécules des corps'' (''New Considerations on the Theory of Proportions Determined in Combinations, and on Determination of the Masses of Atoms'') and shortly afterwards, ''Mémoire sur la manière de ramener les composès organiques aux lois ordinaires des proportions déterminées'' (&quot;Note on the Manner of Finding the Organic Composition by the Ordinary Laws of Determined Proportions&quot;).

In 1841, he published his work in ''Fisica dei corpi ponderabili, ossia Trattato della costituzione materiale de' corpi'', 4 volumes.

==Response to the theory==
The scientific community did not give great attention to Avogadro's theory, and it was not immediately accepted. [[André-Marie Ampère]] proposed a very similar theory three years later (in his ''{{lang|fr|Sur la détermination des proportions dans lesquelles les corps se combinent d'après le nombre et la disposition respective des molécules dont leurs particules intégrantes sont composées}}''; &quot;On the Determination of Proportions in which Bodies Combine According to the Number and the Respective Disposition of the Molecules by Which Their Integral Particles Are Made&quot;), but the same indifference was shown to his theory as well.

Only through studies by [[Charles Frédéric Gerhardt]] and [[Auguste Laurent]] on [[organic chemistry]] was it possible to demonstrate that Avogadro's law explained why the same quantities of molecules in a gas have the same volume.

Unfortunately, related experiments with some inorganic substances showed seeming contradictions. This was finally resolved by [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]], as announced at [[Karlsruhe Congress]] in 1860, four years after Avogadro's death. He explained that these exceptions were due to molecular dissociations at certain temperatures, and that Avogadro's law determined not only molecular masses, but atomic masses as well.

In 1911, a meeting in Turin commemorated the hundredth anniversary of the publication of Avogadro's classic 1811 paper. King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] attended, and Avogadro's great contribution to chemistry was recognized.

[[Rudolf Clausius]], with his kinetic theory on gases proposed in 1857, provided further evidence for Avogadro's Law. [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] showed that Avogadro's theory also held in dilute solutions.

Avogadro is hailed as a founder of the [[Atomic theory#Modern atomic theory|atomic-molecular theory]].

'''Queen''' &lt;!-- Do not change this to &quot;is&quot; --&gt;are&lt;!-- is correct UK English --&gt; a British [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1970. Their classic line-up was [[Freddie Mercury]] (lead vocals, piano), [[Brian May]] (guitar, vocals), [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (drums, vocals) and [[John Deacon]] (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by [[progressive rock]], [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as [[arena rock]] and [[pop rock]].

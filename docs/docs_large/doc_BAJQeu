Athletes with [[physical disability|physical disabilities]] have competed at separate international events since 1952. The [[International Paralympic Committee]] governs the competitions in athletics, and hosts the [[Paralympic Games]], which have continued since [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Paralympics|1960]].&lt;ref name=ACanada/&gt;&lt;ref name=ipc/&gt;

Competitors at elite level competitions, are classified by disability, to arrange athletes with a similar disability in the same event. A classified T12 athlete for example, is a track athlete with a visual impairment.&lt;ref&gt;International Paralympic Committee, [http://www.paralympic.org/Athletics/Rulesandregulations/Classification IPC Athletics Classification]&lt;/ref&gt;
* F = Field athletes
* T = Track athletes
* 11–13 – [[visual impairment]]. Compete with a [[sighted guide]].
* 20 – Intellectual disability
* 31–38 – [[cerebral palsy]]
* 40–46 – [[amputation]], and others (including athletes with [[dwarfism]])
* 51–58 – Wheelchair

Operating independently of the Paralympic movement, [[deaf]] athletes have a long-established tradition of organised athletics, with the first major world competition being included at the 1924 [[Deaflympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciss.org/sports/AT Athletics]. International Committee of Sports for the Deaf. Retrieved 2019-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary impediments to the inclusion of deaf athletes in mainstream athletics are sound based elements of the sport, such as the [[starter's pistol]]. This can be a disadvantage even in Paralympic sport, as shown in by the example of [[Olivia Breen]] who failed to hear a false start in a cerebral palsy class race at the 2012 Paralympics.&lt;ref&gt;Swinbourne, Charlie (2012-09-06).

Retrieved 2019-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[wheelchair racing]] athletes compete in lightweight racing chairs.  Most major [[marathon]]s have wheelchair divisions and the elite racers consistently beat the runners on foot. The speed of wheel chair racers has caused difficulties for race organisers in properly staggering their start times compared to runners. A collision between Josh Cassidy (a wheelchair racer) and Tiki Gelana (a leading female marathoner) at the [[2013 London Marathon]] brought the issue into the spotlight again.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth A Davies, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/london-marathon/10010646/London-Marathon-2013-rethink-over-wheelchair-race-start-time-to-avoid-repeat-of-Josh-Cassidy-collision.html London Marathon 2013: rethink over wheelchair race start time to avoid repeat of Josh Cassidy collision], ''The Guardian'', 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, athletes with a disability reach a level at which they can compete against able-bodied athletes.  Legally blind [[Marla Runyan]] ran in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics and won a gold medal in the 1500 metres at the [[Athletics at the 1999 Pan American Games|1999 Pan American Games]].  [[Oscar Pistorius]], a double amputee, was a semi-finalist at the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics|2011 World Championships]] and won a silver medal as part of South Africa's [[2011 World Championships in Athletics – Men's 4 × 400 metres relay|4 × 400 metres relay team]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/02/oscar-pistorius-silver-world-championships Oscar Pistorius wins silver at World Championships despite not running]. ''The Guardian'' (2011-09-02). Retrieved 2019-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[masters athletics]] it is far more common to make an accommodation for athletes with a disability.

The disability categories have caused dispute among athletes, with some athletes being accused of exaggerating their level of disability in order to compete in less challenging categories.&lt;ref&gt;Kelner, Martha (2017-10-31).

==Venues==
Professional athletics almost exclusively takes place in one of three types of venue: [[stadium]]s, set courses on grass or woodland, and road-based courses. Such venues ensure that events take place in a relatively standardised manner, as well as improving the safety of athletes and enjoyment for spectators. At a more basic level, many forms of athletics demand very little in terms of venue requirements; almost any open space or area of field can provide a suitable venue for basic running, jumping and throwing competitions.

===Track and field stadium===
[[File:Piste athlétisme-fr.svg|thumb|right|A typical layout of an outdoor track and field stadium]]
A standard outdoor track is in the shape of a [[Stadium (geometry)|stadium]],&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Stadium.html&lt;/ref&gt; 400 metres in length, and has at least eight lanes 1.22&amp;nbsp;m in width (small arenas might have six lanes). Older track facilities may have nonstandard track lengths, such as 440 yards (402.3&amp;nbsp;m; 1/4 mile) (common in the United States). Historically, tracks were covered by a dirt running surface. Modern [[All-weather running track]]s are covered by a synthetic weather-resistant running surface, which typically consists of rubber (either black SBR or colored EPDM granules), bound by polyurethane or latex resins. Older tracks may be [[cinder]]-covered.

A standard indoor track is designed similarly to an outdoor track, but is only 200 metres in length and has between four and eight lanes, each with width between 0.90&amp;nbsp;m and 1.10&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |title=IAAF Competition Rules 2010-2011 |accessdate=2011-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011023632/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-11 |df= }} IAAF Competition Rules 2010–2011&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the bends of an indoor track will be banked to compensate for the small turning radius. However, because of space limitations, indoor tracks may have other nonstandard lengths, such as 160-yard (146.3&amp;nbsp;m) indoor track at [[Madison Square Garden]] used for the [[Millrose Games]]. Because of space limitations, meetings held at indoor facilities do not hold many of athletics events typically contested outdoors.

===Cross country courses===
[[File:Armedforces crosscountry coppingerandballas.jpg|thumb|A cross country race taking place at a snowy park in the United States.]]
There is no standardised form of cross country course and each venue is significantly defined by the environment it contains – some may be relatively flat and featureless, while others may be more challenging with natural obstacles, tight turns, and undulating ground. While a small number of purpose-built courses exist, the vast majority of cross country running courses are created by cordoning a specific area within any open natural land, typically a [[park]], [[woodland]] or [[Open space reserve|greenspace]] near a [[Human settlement|settlement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;XCRules&quot;&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/80/20091027085725_httppostedfile_CompRules-BAT_17164.pdf Competition Rules 2010–11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217151957/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/80/20091027085725_httppostedfile_CompRules-BAT_17164.pdf |date=2010-12-17 }} (pp. 227–28). [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 2010-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the elite and professional level, courses must be looped and each lap must be between 1750&amp;nbsp;m and 2000&amp;nbsp;m in length. Severe obstacles such as deep ditches, high barriers and thick undergrowth not normally present; the course should be able to be completed whilst remaining on foot throughout. In order to maintain the sport's distinction from road running, the usage of unnatural or [[macadam]]ised surfaces is generally kept to a minimum or avoided entirely.&lt;ref name=XCRules/&gt;

Because the majority of races take place on areas of grass, soil, mud or earth, [[weather conditions]] can significantly affect the difficulty of cross country courses, as [[snow]] and [[rain]] reduces traction and can create areas of standing water.

===Road courses===
[[File:10k run Toronto May 2010.jpg|thumb|A typical road running course on the inner-city roads of [[Toronto]]]]
The surface of road races is highly important and the IAAF dictate that the courses must be along man-made roads, bicycle paths or footpaths. Courses set along major roads of cities are typical of road running events, and [[traffic]] is usually cordoned off from the area during the competition. While soft ground, such as grass, is generally avoided, races may start and finish on soft ground or within a track and field stadium. Road racing courses come in two primary types: looped and point-to-point. Courses may be measured and designed to cover a standardised distance, such as {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}, or they may simply follow a set route between two landmarks.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRRules&quot;&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/80/20091027085725_httppostedfile_CompRules-BAT_17164.pdf Competition Rules 2010–11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217151957/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/80/20091027085725_httppostedfile_CompRules-BAT_17164.pdf |date=2010-12-17 }} pp. 224–26. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 2010-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Road running courses over 5&amp;nbsp;km usually offer drinks or refreshment stations for runners at designated points alongside the course and medical professionals are present at the courses of major races due to the health risks involved with long-distance running.&lt;ref name=RRRules/&gt;

Elite road walks are conducted on closed loop courses (usually loops of 2,000 or 2,500 meters). Refreshment stations are also present over long distance walking competitions, with drinks being available on every lap for races longer than 10&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;RWRules&quot;&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/80/20091027085725_httppostedfile_CompRules-BAT_17164.pdf Competition Rules 2010–11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217151957/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/80/20091027085725_httppostedfile_CompRules-BAT_17164.pdf |date=2010-12-17 }} (pp. 220–23).

==Organizations==

In 1912, the formation of the [[List of international sport federations|international governing body]] for athletics, the [[International Amateur Athletics Federation]], began. In recognition of the movement of the sport from [[amateur sports|amateurism]] towards [[Professional sports|professionalism]] that began in the late 1970s, the word ''amateur'' was dropped from the name, and the organization was rebranded as the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2001. In late 2019, another rebranding began, with '''World Athletics''' as the new title of the governing body.

World Athletics has 215 member nations and territories, which are divided into six continental areas (or area associations).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/aboutiaaf/structure/federations/index.html IAAF National Member Federations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903231859/http://www.iaaf.org/aboutiaaf/structure/federations/index.html |date=2009-09-03 }}. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 26 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The six association areas are for [[Asian Athletics Association|Asia]], [[Confederation of African Athletics|Africa]], [[European Athletics Association|Europe]], [[Oceania Athletics Association|Oceania]], [[North America, Central America and Caribbean Athletic Association|North America]] and [[South American Athletics Confederation|South America]]. The sports within athletics do not have their own independent governing bodies at either international or continental level; instead, all fall under the athletics authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chap2&quot;&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/imported/9589.pdf IAAF Member Federation Manual – Chapter 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525092736/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/imported/9589.pdf |date=2010-05-25 }} (pp. 17–18).

==Competitions==
Athletics competitions can be broadly divided into three types: international championships, national championships, and annual meetings and races. Athletics at international championships, or Games, represent the pinnacle of competition within the sport, and they are contested between athletes representing their country or region. The organisation of these competitions is usually overseen by either a world, continental, or regional athletics governing body. Athletes gain entry into these competitions by earning selection from their national athletics governing body, which is generally done by assessing athletes via their past achievements or performances at a national selection event. National championships are annual competitions endorsed by a national governing body which serve the purpose of deciding the country's best athlete in each event. Annual one-day meetings and races form the most basic level of competition and are the most common format of athletics contests. These events are often invitational and are organised by sports organisations, sports promoters, or other institutions.

Competitions typically feature only one of the sports within athletics. However, major outdoor international athletics championships and athletics competitions held as part of [[multi-sport events]] usually feature a combination of track and field, road running and racewalking events

===International competitions===
====Multi-sport events====
[[File:Beijing Olympic Stadium August 15 709713b52c o.jpg|thumb|The athletics competition underway at the main stadium of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]]]
The modern [[Summer Olympics]] was the first event at which a global athletics competition took place. All the four major sports within athletics have featured in the [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic athletics programme]] since its inception in 1896, although cross country has since been dropped. The Olympic competition is the most prestigious athletics contest, and many athletics events are among the most watched events at the Summer Olympics. A total of 47 athletics events are held at the Olympics, 24 for men and 23 for women (as of London 2012). The events within the men's and women's programmes are either identical or have a similar equivalent, with the sole exception being that men contest the 50&amp;nbsp;km race walk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20200417045838/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/2012/ATH/ Sports Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the model of the Olympics, various other [[multi-sport event]]s arose during the 20th century, which included athletics as a core sport within the programme from the outset. These included the [[Athletics at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]], the [[Athletics at the Central American and Caribbean Games|Central American and Caribbean Games]], [[Athletics at the Universiade|Universiade]], and many others.

The [[Summer Paralympics]] include athletes with a [[physical disability]]. Track and field, and road events have featured in the [[Athletics at the Paralympic Games|Paralympic athletics programme]] since its inception in 1960. The Paralympic competition is the most prestigious athletics contest where athletes with a physical disability compete. Athletics at the Paralympic Games also include [[wheelchair racing]] where athletes compete in lightweight racing chairs. Athletes with a [[visual impairment]] compete with a [[sighted guide]]. At the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in [[London]], for the first time at an international athletics event, the guides received medals,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120317184215/http://www.insideworldparasport.biz/insideparasport/9218-guides-to-be-awarded-paralympic-gold-medals Exclusive: Guides to be awarded Paralympic medals at London 2012], insideworldparasport.biz, February 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; such as the pilots in cycling, and the guides at the [[Paralympic Winter Games]] have done for a while.

====World championships====
The [[World Athletics Championships]] is the primary global athletics championships held by World Athletics. The biennial competition was first held in 1983 and now features an event programme which is identical to the Olympics. Thus, road running, racewalking and track and field are the sports which feature at the competition. Cross country running has its own discrete global championships – the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]] – which has been held annually since 1973. The [[IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics]] is a biennial athletics championships which features solely indoor track and field events. The foremost separate road running event is the annual [[IAAF World Half Marathon Championships]] (formerly World Road Running Championships). While not having official world championship status, the biennial [[IAAF World Race Walking Cup]] fulfils a similar role for the sport of racewalking. Outdoor track and field is the only sport in athletics that does not have a its own distinct global championship which is separate from other types of athletics, although the [[IAAF Continental Cup]] (a quadrennial competition between continental teams) is composed entirely of outdoor track and field events.

Other world championships include the [[IAAF World Junior Championships in Athletics|IAAF World Junior]] and [[IAAF World Youth Championships in Athletics|World Youth Championships in Athletics]], which are for athletes under-19 and under-17, respectively. [[World Masters Athletics]] conducts the [[World Masters Athletics Championships]] for athletes in 5-year age divisions over the age of 35.  The now defunct [[IAAF World Road Relay Championships]] served as the global event for [[ekiden]] marathon relay races. 

Elite athletes with a physical disability compete at the [[World Para Athletics Championships]].

==Culture and media==
[[File:Pentathlon athlets Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2637.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Ancient Greek pottery showing the javelin and the discus throw]]
Athletics, and its athletes in particular, has been artistically depicted since ancient times – one of the surviving instances include runners and high jumpers in the motifs of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian tombs dating from 2250&amp;nbsp;BC. Athletics was much respected in Ancient Greece and the events within the [[ancient pentathlon]] provided inspiration for large statues such as the [[Discobolus]] and [[Discophoros]], and for motifs on countless vase and [[pottery]] works. [[Aristotle]] discussed the significance of the pentathlon in his [[treatise]] ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' and reflected on the athlete aesthetic of the period: &quot;a body capable of enduring all efforts, either of the racecourse or of bodily strength...This is why the athletes in the pentathlon are most beautiful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/pentathlon.html Ancient Olympic Events; Pentathlon]. [[Perseus digital library]]. Retrieved on 2009-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Films about athletics are overwhelmingly focused on running events: the 1962 film ''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (film)|The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'' (based on the [[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner|book of the same name]]) explores cross country running as a means of escape. ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', perhaps one of the most well-known athletics films, is a fictionalised account of [[Eric Liddell]] and [[Harold Abrahams]]'s chase for sprint [[gold medal]]s at the [[Athletics at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]. Track and field has been the subject of American films such as ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1981) and ''[[Across the Tracks]]'' (1991). [[Biopic]]s are found within the genre, including ''[[Prefontaine (film)|Prefontaine]]'' (regarding [[Steve Prefontaine]]) and ''[[Jim Thorpe – All-American]]'' (1951) featuring [[Burt Lancaster]] as Thorpe. Documentaries are also common with examples such as 2007 film ''[[Spirit of the Marathon]]'', which follows runners' preparations for the 2005 [[Chicago Marathon]].

Books on the subject are predominantly non-fiction, and tend towards the forms of training manuals and historical accounts of athletics. The story of the [[four-minute mile]] has been a particularly popular subject, spawning books such as ''[[The Perfect Mile]]'' and ''[[3:59.4: The Quest to Break the Four Minute Mile]]''.

Athletics [[journalism]] has spawned a number of dedicated [[periodical]]s including ''[[Athletics Weekly]]'' and ''[[Race Walking Record]]'', both of which were first published in England in the early 1940s, and ''[[Track &amp; Field News]]'' which was first published in the United States in 1948. ''[[Runner's World]]'' has been in print since 1966 and the ''[[Track &amp; Field Magazine of Japan]]'' (''Rikujyo Kyogi Magazine'') is another long-running publication.

Athletics events have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins.  One of the recent samples is the €10 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Running commemorative coin]], minted in 2003 to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. In the obverse of the coin, a modern athlete figure appears in the foreground, shown in the starting position, while in the background two ancient runners are carved in a manner that gives the appearance of a coin that is &quot;worn&quot; by time. This scene originally appeared on a black-figure vase of the 6th century BC.

The '''hammer throw''' is one of the four throwing events in regular [[track and field]] competitions, along with the [[discus throw]], [[shot put]] and [[Javelin throw|javelin]]. The &quot;hammer&quot; used in this sport is not like any of the tools also called by that name. It consists of a metal ball attached by a steel wire to a grip. The size of the ball varies between men's and women's competitions (see [[Hammer throw#Competition|Competition]] section below for details).

==History==
With roots dating back to the 15th century, the contemporary version of the hammer throw is one of the oldest of [[Olympic Games]] competitions, first included at the [[1900 Olympics|1900 games]] in [[Paris, France]] (the second [[Olympiad]] of the modern era). Its history since the late 1960s and legacy prior to inclusion in the Olympics have been dominated by [[Europe]]an and [[Eastern European]] influence, which has affected interest in the event in other parts of the world.

The hammer evolved from its early informal origins to become part of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Highland games]] in the late 18th century, where the original version of the event is still contested today.

While the men's hammer throw has been part of the Olympics since 1900, the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] did not start ratifying women's marks until 1995. Women's hammer throw was first included in the Olympics at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 summer games]] in [[Sydney, Australia]], after having been included in the [[World Championships]] a year earlier.

Although commonly thought of as a strength event, technical advancements in the last 30 years have evolved hammer throw competition to a point where more focus is on speed in order to gain maximum distance.

The throwing motion involves about two swings from stationary position, then three, four or very rarely five rotations of the body in circular motion using a complicated heel-toe movement of the foot. The ball moves in a circular path, gradually increasing in velocity with each turn with the high point of the hammer ball toward the target sector and the low point at the back of the circle. The thrower releases the ball at the side of the circle as the hammer's velocity tends upward and toward the target.

{{Asof|2015}} the men's hammer world record is held by [[Yuriy Sedykh]], who threw {{T&amp;Fcalc|86.74}} at the [[1986 European Athletics Championships]] in [[Stuttgart]], [[West Germany]] on 30 August.

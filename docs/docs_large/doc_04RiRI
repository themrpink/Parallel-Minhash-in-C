In [[telecommunications]], the '''intercharacter interval''' is the [[time]] interval between the end of the [[stop signal]] of one [[character (computing)|character]] and the beginning of the [[start signal]] of the next character of an [[asynchronous communication|asynchronous transmission]].  

The intercharacter interval may be of any duration. The signal sense of the intercharacter interval is always the same as the sense of the stop element, ''i.e.'', &quot;1&quot; or &quot;[[mark (computing)|mark]].&quot;

'''Interconnect facility''':  In a [[communications network]], one or more communications links that (a) are used to provide local area communications service among several locations and (b) collectively form a [[node (networking)|node]] in the network.  

An interconnect facility may include network control and administrative circuits as well as the primary [[traffic]] circuits. 

An interconnect facility may use any [[Transmission medium|medium]] available and may be redundant.

An '''interference filter''' or '''[[dichroic filter]]''' is an [[optical filter]] that reflects one or more spectral bands or lines and transmits others, while maintaining a nearly zero coefficient of [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] for all wavelengths of interest. An interference filter may be [[high-pass]], [[low-pass]], [[bandpass]], or band-rejection.

An interference filter consists of multiple thin layers of [[dielectric]] material having different refractive indices. There also may be metallic layers. In its broadest meaning, interference filters comprise also etalons that could be implemented as tunable interference filters. Interference filters are [[wavelength]]-selective by virtue of the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] effects that take place between the incident and reflected waves at the thin-film boundaries. The important characteristic of the filter is the form of the leaving signal. It is considered that the best form is a rectangle.

An '''intermediate distribution frame''' ('''IDF''') is a [[distribution frame]] in a [[telephone exchange|central office]] or [[Customer-premises equipment|customer premises]], which cross connects the [[User (telecommunications)|user]] [[Electrical cable|cable]] media to individual user [[Telecommunication circuit|line circuits]] and may serve as a distribution point for multipair cables from the [[main distribution frame]] (MDF) or [[combined distribution frame]] (CDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from these frames.

IDFs are used for telephone exchange central office, customer-premises equipment, [[wide area network]] (WAN), and [[local area network]] (LAN) environments, among others.

In central office environments the IDF may contain circuit termination equipment from various auxiliary components. In WAN and LAN environments IDFs can hold devices of different types including [[backup]] systems ([[Hard disk drive|hard drives]] or other media as self-contained, or as [[RAID]]s, [[CD-ROM]]s, etc.), [[Computer network|networking]] ([[Network switch|switches]], [[Ethernet hub|hubs]], [[Router (computing)|routers]]), and connections ([[Optical fiber|fiber optics]], [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]], [[Structured cabling|category cables]]) and so on.

[[File:IP spoofing en.svg|thumb|example scenario of IP address spoofing]]
In [[computer networking]], '''IP address spoofing''' or '''IP spoofing''' is the creation of [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] with a false source [[IP address]], for the purpose of impersonating another computing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/ip-spoofing-introduction |title=IP Spoofing: An Introduction |last=Tanase |first=Matthew |publisher=Symantec |date=March 10, 2003 |accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The basic protocol for sending data over the Internet network and many other computer networks is the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP). The protocol specifies that  each IP packet must have a [[Header (computing)|header]] which contains (among other things) the IP address of the sender of the packet. The source IP address is normally the address that the packet was sent from, but the sender's address in the header can be altered, so that to the recipient it appears that the packet came from another source. 

The protocol requires the receiving computer to send back a response to the source IP address, so that spoofing is mainly used when the sender can anticipate the network response or does not care about the response.

The source IP address provides only limited information about the sender. It may provide general information on the region, city and town when on the packet was sent. It does not provide information on the identity of the sender or the computer being used.

==Applications==
IP address spoofing involving the use of a trusted IP address can be used by network intruders to overcome network security measures, such as [[authentication]] based on IP addresses. This type of attack is most effective where trust relationships exist between machines. For example, it is common on some corporate networks to have internal systems trust each other, so that users can log in without a username or password provided they are connecting from another machine on the internal network ‚Äì which would require them already being logged in. By spoofing a connection from a trusted machine, an attacker on the same network may be able to access the target machine without authentication.

===19th century===
The nineteenth century is usually defined by concurrent [[revival styles]], including [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]], Neoclassicism, and Rococo. The design [[reform]]s of the late century introduced the [[Aesthetic movement]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. [[Art Nouveau]] was influenced by both of these movements.

===Early North American===
This design was in many ways rooted in necessity and emphasizes both form and materials. Early British Colonial American{{vague|date=May 2015}} chairs and tables are often constructed with turned spindles and chair backs often constructed with steaming to bend the wood. Wood choices tend to be deciduous hardwoods with a particular emphasis on the wood of edible or fruit bearing trees such as cherry or walnut.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Modernism===
{{see also|Art Nouveau furniture}}
[[File:Rietveld chair 1b.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|[[Red and Blue Chair]] (1917), designed by [[Gerrit Rietveld]]]]

The first three-quarters of the twentieth century is often seen as the march towards [[Modernism]]. [[Art Deco]], [[De Stijl]], [[Bauhaus]], [[Jugendstil]], [[Wiener Werkstätte Style|Wiener Werkstätte]], and [[Vienna Secession]] designers all worked to some degree within the Modernist idiom. Born from the [[Bauhaus]] and Art Deco/Streamline styles came the post WWII &quot;[[Mid-Century Modern]]&quot; style using materials developed during the war including laminated plywood, plastics, and fiberglass. Prime examples include furniture designed by George Nelson Associates, Charles and Ray Eames, [[Paul McCobb]], Florence Knoll, Harry Bertoia, Eero Saarinen, Harvey Probber, Vladamir Kagan and [[Danish modern]] designers including [[Finn Juhl]] and [[Arne Jacobsen]]. [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] design, intersecting the [[Pop art]] movement, gained steam in the 1960s and 70s, promoted in the 80s by groups such as the Italy-based [[Memphis movement]]. [[Transitional furniture]] is intended to fill a place between Traditional and Modern tastes.

===Ecodesign===
Great efforts from individuals, governments, and companies has led to the manufacturing of products with higher sustainability known as [[Ecodesign]]. This new line of furniture is based on environmentally friendly design. Its use and popularity are increasing each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ecodesign Report – The Results of a survey Amongst Australian Industrial Design Consultancies |url=https://www.bigsonline.com/blog/ecodesign-report-results-survey-amongst-australian-industrial-design-consultancies/ |website=Big's Furniture |access-date=31 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219211919/https://www.bigsonline.com/blog/ecodesign-report-results-survey-amongst-australian-industrial-design-consultancies/ |archive-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is [[Live edge]], heralding a return to natural shapes and textures within the home.&lt;ref name=povo&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gray|first=Channing |title=Haute and cool: Fine Furnishings show branches out in 10th year with a bigger spread of classic and cutting-edge pieces|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/305275225/Haute-and-Cool-Fine-Furnishings-Providence-Show-Branches-Out-in-10th-Year

===Asian history===
[[Asian furniture]] has a quite distinct history. The traditions out of [[India]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Pakistan]], Indonesia (Bali and Java) and [[Japan]] are some of the best known, but places such as [[Mongolia]], and the countries of [[South East Asia]] have unique facets of their own.

The use of uncarved wood and bamboo and the use of heavy lacquers are well known Chinese styles. It is worth noting that Chinese furniture varies dramatically from one dynasty to the next. Chinese ornamentation is highly inspired by paintings, including: bamboo trees, chrysanthemums, waterlilies, irises, magnolias, flowers and branches of cherry, apple, apricot and plum, or elongated bamboo leaves. Animal ornaments include: lions, bulls, ducks, peacocks, parrots, pheasants, roosters, [[ibis|ibises]] and butterflies. The dragon is the symbol of earth fertility, and of the power and wisdom of the emperor. Lacquers are mostly populated with princesses, various chinese people, soldiers, children, ritually and daily scenes. Architecture has brought geometric ornaments, like [[Meander (art)|meanders]] and labyrinths. The interior of a chinese house was simple and sober. All Chinese furniture is made of wood. The used species are: ebony, [[teak]], rosewood for heavier furniture (chairs, tables and benches) bamboo, pine and larch for lighter furniture (stools and small chairs).{{sfn|Bucătaru |1991|pp=152, 153, 154 &amp; 156}}

Traditional Japanese furniture is well known for its [[minimalism|minimalist]] style, extensive use of wood, high-quality craftsmanship and reliance on wood grain instead of painting or thick lacquer. Japanese chests are known as [[Tansu]], known for elaborate decorative iron work, and are some of the most sought-after of Japanese antiques. The antiques available generally date back to the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] and [[Meiji period]]s. Both the technique of lacquering and the lacquer (resin of [[Rhus vernicifera]]) originate from China. Rhus vernicifera grows very well in Japan too. The recipes of preparation are original Japanese: resin is mixed with wheat flower, clay or pottery powder, [[turpentine]], iron powder or wood coal. In ornamentation, the chrysanthemum, known as kiku, the national flower, is a very loved ornament. When it has 16 petals, it is the imperial symbol. Cherry and apple flowers are used for decorating screens, vases and [[shōji|shōjis]]. Animal ornaments include: dragons, [[Common carp|carps]], cranes, gooses, tigers, horses and monkeys. Architectural elements are also present: houses, pavilions, towers, [[torii]] gates, bridges and temples. The furniture of a Japanese house consists of tables, shelves, wardrobes, small holders for flowers, bonsais or for [[bonkei]], boxes, lanterns with wooden frames and translucent paper, neck and elbow holders, and [[Jardiniere|jardinieres]].{{sfn|Bucătaru |1991|p=164, 165 &amp; 166}}

==Types==
{{Main|List of furniture types}}

===For sitting===
Seating is amongst the oldest known furniture types, and authors including [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] regard it as the most important.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;/&gt; In additional to the functional design, seating has had an important decorative element from ancient times to the present day. This includes carved and sculpted pieces intended as works of art, as well as the styling of seats to indicate social importance, with senior figures or leaders granted the use of specially designed seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;/&gt;

The simplest form of seat is the [[chair]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physique of office chair|url=http://foss-aalborg.dk/de-bedste-kontorstole-i-2016/|website=Foss Alborg|access-date=8 September 2016|date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a piece of furniture designed to allow a single person to sit down, which has a back and legs, as well as a platform for sitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chair|title=Definition of CHAIR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairs often feature cushions made from various fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Svso1ZaR9oC&amp;pg=PA30|title=Soft Furnishings|first=Chris|last=Jefferys|date=1 October 2006|publisher=New Holland Publishers|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1-84330-903-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of wood used==
{{Main|List of woods}}
All different types of woods have unique signature marks that can help in easy identification of the type. Both [[hardwood]]s and [[softwood]]s are used in furniture manufacturing, and each has their own specific uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovedesigns.com/woods.html|title=Types of Wood |publisher=Hoove Designs |access-date=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most commonly, quality furniture is made out of [[hardwood]] which is made from oak, maple, mahogany, teak, walnut, cherry and birch. Highest quality wood will have been air dried to rid it of its moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://furniture.about.com/od/buyingfurniture/a/woodquality.htm|title=Judge Quality in Wood Furniture |last=Abbas |first=Abe |publisher=About.com |access-date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A candle flame is formed because wax vaporizes on burning. A candle flame is widely recognized as having between three and five regions or &quot;zones&quot;:
* Zone I - this is the non-luminous, lowest, and coolest part of the candle flame.  It is located around the base of the wick where there is insufficient oxygen for fuel to burn.  Temperatures are around {{convert|600|C|F}}.
* Zone II - this is the ''blue zone'' which surrounds the base of the flame.  Here the supply of oxygen is plentiful, and the fuel burns clean and blue.  It is heat from this zone which causes the wax to melt. Temperatures are around {{convert|800|C|F}}
* Zone III - the ''dark zone'' is a region directly above the wick containing unburnt wax.  [[Pyrolysis]] takes place here.  Temperature is around {{convert|1000|C|F}}
*Zone IV - the ''middle'' or ''luminous zone'' is yellow/ white and is located above the dark zone.  It is the brightest zone, but not the hottest.  It is an oxygen-depleted zone with insufficient oxygen to burn all of the wax vapor rising from below it resulting in only partial combustion. The zone also contains unburnt carbon particles. Temperature is around {{convert|1200|C|F}}.
* Zone V - The non-luminous  ''outer zone'' or ''veil'' surrounds Zone IV.  Here the flame is at its hottest, at around {{convert|1400|C|F}}, and complete combustion occurs. It is light blue in color though most of it is invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|work=Ohio State University|title=FTIR STUDY OF COMBUSTION SPECIES IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF A CANDLE FLAME|author=Allen R.

Publication Department, 2010, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main determinant of the height of a candle flame is the diameter of the wick. This is evidenced in [[tealight]]s where the wick is very thin and the flame is very small. Candles whose main purpose is illumination use a much thicker wick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sunderland |first1=P.B. |last2=Quintiere |first2=J.G. |last3=Tabaka |first3=G.A. |last4=Lian |first4=D. |last5=Chiu |first5=C.-W. |title=Analysis and measurement of candle flame shapes |url=http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~pbs/2011-Sunderland-et-al-PCI.pdf |date=6 October 2010 |journal=Proceedings of the Combustion Institute |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=2489–2496 |doi=10.1016/j.proci.2010.06.095 |accessdate=2015-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090022/http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~pbs/2011-Sunderland-et-al-PCI.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of study===
One of [[Michael Faraday]]'s significant works was ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]'', where he gives an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary development, workings and science of candles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1860Faraday-candle.asp |title=Internet History Sourcebooks |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazards==
According to the [[National Fire Protection Association]], candles are a leading source of residential fires in the United States with almost 10% of civilian injuries and 6% of fatalities from fire attributed to candles.&lt;ref&gt;John Hall, NFPA 2009,  {{cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727124011/http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files//PDF/Research/Fire_overview_2009.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A candle flame that is longer than its laminar smoke point will emit [[soot]].&lt;ref&gt;K.M. Allan, J.R. Kaminski, J.C. Bertrand, J. Head, [[Peter B. Sunderland]], Laminar Smoke Points of Wax Candles, Combustion Science and Technology 181 (2009) 800–811.&lt;/ref&gt; Proper wick trimming will reduce soot emissions from most candles.

The liquid wax is hot and can cause skin burns, but the amount and temperature are generally rather limited and the burns are seldom serious. The best way to avoid getting burned from splashed wax is to use a [[candle snuffer]] instead of blowing on the flame. A candle snuffer is usually a small metal cup on the end of a long handle. Placing the snuffer over the flame cuts off the oxygen supply. Snuffers were common in the home when candles were the main source of lighting before electric lights were available.  Ornate snuffers, often combined with a taper for lighting, are still found in those churches which regularly use large candles.

Glass candle-holders are sometimes cracked by thermal shock from the candle flame, particularly when the candle burns down to the end. When burning candles in glass holders or jars, users should avoid lighting candles with chipped or cracked containers, and stop use once 1/2&amp;nbsp;inch or less of wax remains.

A former worry regarding the safety of candles was that a [[lead]] core was used in the wicks to keep them upright in container candles. Without a stiff core, the wicks of a container candle could sag and drown in the deep wax pool. Concerns rose that the lead in these wicks would vaporize during the burning process, releasing lead vapors — a known health and developmental hazard. Lead core wicks have not been common since the 1970s. Today, most metal-cored wicks use [[zinc]] or a zinc [[alloy]], which has become the industry standard. Wicks made from specially treated paper and cotton are also available.

==Regulation==
International markets have developed a range of standards and [[regulation]]s to ensure compliance, while maintaining and improving [[safety]], including:
* Europe: GPSD, EN 15493, EN 15494, EN 15426, EN 14059, [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], RAL-GZ 041 Candles (Germany), French Decree 91-1175
* United States: ASTM F2058, ASTM F2179, ASTM F2417, ASTM F2601, ASTM F2326 ( all are federal and applies in all 50 states), [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65]] ([[California]] only), [[CONEG]] ([[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] states only)
* China: QB/T 2119 Basic Candle, QB/T 2902 Art Candle, QB/T 2903 Jar Candle, GB/T 22256 Jelly Candle

==Accessories==
[[File:Wick-Trimmer.jpg|thumb|Wick-trimmer]]
===Candle holders===
Decorative candleholders, especially those shaped as a pedestal, are called [[candlestick]]s; if multiple candle tapers are held, the term ''candelabrum'' is also used. The root form of ''[[chandelier]]'' is from the word for candle, but now usually refers to an electric fixture. The word ''chandelier'' is sometimes now used to describe a hanging fixture designed to hold multiple tapers.

Many candle holders use a friction-tight socket to keep the candle upright. In this case, a candle that is slightly too wide will not fit in the holder, and a candle that is slightly too narrow will wobble. Candles that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; candles that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the candle and candle holders were made in the same place, so they were appropriately sized, but [[common market|international trade]] has combined the modern candle with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting candle more common. This friction tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers. For [[tea light]] candles, there is a variety of candle holders, including small glass holders and elaborate multi-candle stands. The same is true for [[votive candle|votives]]. Wall sconces are available for tea light and votive candles. For pillar-type candles, the assortment of candle holders is broad. A fireproof plate, such as a glass plate or small mirror, can be a candle holder for a pillar-style candle. A pedestal of any kind, with the appropriate-sized fireproof top, is another option. A large glass bowl with a large flat bottom and tall mostly vertical curved sides is called a hurricane. The pillar-style candle is placed at the bottom center of the hurricane. A hurricane on a pedestal is sometimes sold as a unit.

A [[bobèche]] is a drip-catching ring, which may also be affixed to a candle holder, or used independently of one. Bobèches can range from ornate metal or glass to simple plastic, cardboard, or wax paper. Use of paper or plastic bobèches is common at events where candles are distributed to a crowd or audience, such as Christmas carolers or people at other concerts/festivals.

===Candle followers===
These are glass or metal tubes with an internal stricture partway along, which sit around the top of a lit candle. As the candle burns, the wax melts and the follower holds the melted wax in, whilst the stricture rests on the topmost solid portion of wax. Candle followers are often deliberately heavy or weighted to ensure they move down as the candle burns lower, maintaining a seal and preventing wax escape. The purpose of a candle follower is threefold:
* To contain the melted wax, making the candle more efficient, avoiding mess, and producing a more even burn.
* As a decoration, either due to the ornate nature of the device, or (in the case of a glass follower) through light dispersion or colouration.
* If necessary, to shield the flame from wind.

Candle followers are often found in churches on [[altar candle]]s.

===Candle snuffers===
{{main|Candle snuffer}}
Candle snuffers are instruments used to extinguish burning candles by smothering the flame with a small metal cup that is suspended from a long handle, and thus depriving it of oxygen. An older meaning refers to a scissor-like tool used to trim the wick of a candle. With skill, this could be done without extinguishing the flame. The instrument now known as a candle snuffer was formerly called an &quot;extinguisher&quot; or &quot;douter&quot;.

'''Utopian and dystopian fiction''' are [[literary genre|genre]]s of [[speculative fiction]] that explore social and political structures. Utopian fiction portrays a setting that agrees with the author's [[ethos]], having various attributes of another reality intended to appeal to readers. Dystopian fiction (sometimes combined with, but distinct from, [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic fiction]]) offers the opposite: the portrayal of a setting that completely disagrees with the author's ethos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apocalyptic Literature&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title= Apocalyptic Literature|journal= Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd|year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some novels combine both genres, often as a metaphor for the different directions humanity can take depending on its choices, ending up with one of two possible futures. Both [[utopia]]s and [[dystopia]]s are commonly found in [[science fiction]] and other types of speculative fiction, and are themselves arguably, by definition, a type of speculative fiction.

More than 400 utopian works in the English language were published prior to the year 1900, with more than a thousand others appearing during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sargent&quot;&gt;
{{cite journal|last= Sargent|first= Lyman Tower|date= November 1976|title= Themes in Utopian Fiction in English Before Wells|journal= [[Science Fiction Studies]]|volume= 3|issue= 3 | pages= 275–82; see p. 275–6|url= http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/10/sargent10art.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgenres==

===Utopian fiction===
{{Further|Utopia}}
{{see also|List of utopian literature|:Category:Utopian fiction}}
The word ''utopia'' was first used in direct context by [[Sir Thomas More]] in his 1516 work ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]''. The word ''utopia'' resembles both the Greek words &quot;no place&quot;, &quot;outopos&quot;, and &quot;good place&quot;, &quot;eutopos&quot;. In his book, which was written in [[Latin]], More sets out a vision of an ideal [[society]]. As the title suggests, the work presents an ambiguous and ironic projection of the ideal state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas More : why patron of statesmen?|publisher=Lexington Books|others=Curtright, Travis|date=10 September 2015|isbn=978-1-4985-2227-4|location=Lanham|pages=174|oclc=920466356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whimsical nature of the text can be confirmed by the narrator of Utopia's second book, Raphael Hythloday. The Greek root of Hythloday suggests an 'expert in nonsense'. An earlier example of a Utopian work from [[classical antiquity]] is [[Plato]]'s [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']], in which he outlines what he sees as the ideal society and its [[political system]]. Later examples can be seen in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia]]'' and [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'', which uses an anagram of &quot;nowhere&quot; as its title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sargent&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The utopia reader|url=https://archive.org/details/utopiareader00clae|url-access=limited|date=1999|publisher=New York University Press|others=Claeys, Gregory., Sargent, Lyman Tower, 1940-|isbn=0-585-42482-9|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/utopiareader00clae/page/n243 229]|oclc=70728991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, like much of the utopian literature, can be seen as [[satire]]; Butler inverts illness and crime, with punishment for the former and treatment for the latter.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Dystopian fiction===
{{Further|Dystopia|}}
{{See also|List of dystopian literature|List of dystopian comics|List of dystopian films|List of dystopian music, TV programs, and games}}

A [[dystopia]] is a society characterized by a focus on that which is contrary to the author's ethos, such as mass poverty, public mistrust and suspicion, a [[police state]] or oppression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apocalyptic Literature&quot;/&gt; Most authors of dystopian fiction explore at least one reason why things are that way, often as an analogy for similar issues in the real world. Dystopian literature is used to &quot;provide fresh perspectives on problematic social and political practices that might otherwise be taken for granted or considered natural and inevitable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Booker|first=Keith M.|title=The Dystopian Impulse in Modern Literature|year=1994|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn= 9780313290923}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some dystopias claim to be [[utopias]]. [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'' can be seen as a dystopia because of the way sick people are punished as criminals while thieves are &quot;cured&quot; in hospitals, which the inhabitants of Erewhon see as natural and right, i.e. utopian (as mocked in [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'').

Dystopias usually extrapolate elements of contemporary society and this can be read as political warnings. The 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]] predicts a post-apocalyptic future in which society is entirely based on logic and modeled after mechanical systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|date=2017-08-03|title=100 Great Works of Dystopian Fiction|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/best-dystopian-books.html|access-date=2020-06-03|website=Vulture|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]] was influenced by ''We'' when he wrote ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', a novel about Oceania, a state at perpetual war, its population controlled through [[Propaganda#Wartime|propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Taylor|first=D. J.|date=2019-05-22|title=The Ministry of Truth by Dorian Lynskey review – what inspired Orwell's masterpiece?|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/22/the-ministry-of-truth-by-dorian-lynskey-review-a-biography-of-george-orwells-1984|access-date=2020-06-03|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] and the daily [[Two Minutes Hate]] set the tone for an all-pervasive self-censorship. [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' started as a parody of utopian fiction, and projected into the year 2540 industrial and social changes he perceived in 1931, leading to industrial success by a coercively persuaded population divided into five castes; the World State kills everyone 60 years old or older.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

[[Anthony Burgess]]' 1962 novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' is set in a future England that has a subculture of extreme youth violence, and details the protagonist's experiences with the state intent on changing his character at their whim.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' describes a future United States governed by a totalitarian [[theocracy]], where women have no rights,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; and [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Long Walk]]'' describing similar totalitarian scenario, but depicting the participation of teenage boys in a deadly contest. Examples of [[young adult fiction|young adult]] dystopian fiction include (notably all published after 2000) ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' series by [[Suzanne Collins]], the ''[[Divergent (novel)|Divergent]]'' series by [[Veronica Roth]], ''[[The Maze Runner]]'' series by [[James Dashner]], and the ''[[Uglies]]'' series by [[Scott Westerfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Garcia, Antero|title=Critical foundations in young adult literature : challenging genres|date=19 November 2013|publisher=|isbn=978-94-6209-398-0|location=Rotterdam, The Netherlands|pages=71|oclc=863698575}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Video games]] often include dystopias as well; notable examples include the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series, ''[[BioShock]]'', and the later games of the ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' series.

==History of dystopian fiction==
The history of dystopian literature can be traced back to reaction to the French Revolution of 1789, and the prospect that mob rule would produce dictatorship.  Until the late 20th century it was usually anti-collectivist. Dystopian fiction emerged as a response to utopian fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lepore|first1=Jill|title=A Golden Age for Dystopian Fiction|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/05/a-golden-age-for-dystopian-fiction|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=3 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The beginning of technological dystopian fiction can be traced back to [[E.M. Forster]]'s (1879-1970) &quot;[[The Machine Stops]]&quot;. Forster is widely accepted as a 'pioneer of dystopian literature.'{{cn|date=February 2020}} M Keith Booker states that &quot;The Machine Stops&quot;, ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' and ''[[Brave New World]]'' are &quot;the great defining texts of the genre of dystopian fiction, both in [the] vividness of their engagement with real-world social and political issues, and in the scope of their critique of the societies on which they focus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Booker|first1=M Keith|title=The Dystopian Impulse in Modern Literature: Fiction as Social Criticism|date=1994|publisher=Greenwood Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure in dystopian literature is [[H.G. Wells]], whose work ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895) is also widely seen as a prototype of dystopian literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sargent&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Post [[World War II]], even more dystopian fiction was produced. These works of fiction were interwoven with political commentary: the end of World War II brought about fears of an impending [[Third World War]] and a consequent apocalypse.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

Modern dystopian fiction draws not only on topics such as totalitarian governments and anarchism, but also pollution, global warming, climate change, health, the economy and technology. Modern dystopian themes are common in the young adult (YA) genre of literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Young|first=Moira|date=2011-10-22|title=Why is dystopia so appealing to young adults?|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/23/dystopian-fiction|access-date=2020-06-03|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=43281204|title=Engaging &quot;Apolitical&quot; Adolescents: Analyzing the Popularity and Educational Potential of Dystopian Literature Post-9/11|last1=Ames|first1=Melissa|journal=The High School Journal|volume=97|issue=1|pages=3–20|year=2013|doi=10.1353/hsj.2013.0023|s2cid=145131295|url=https://thekeep.eiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&amp;context=eng_fac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinations===
[[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' is sometimes linked with utopian (and dystopian) literature, because it shares the general preoccupation with ideas of the good (and bad) society. Of the countries [[Lemuel Gulliver]] visits, [[Brobdingnag]] and Country of the [[Houyhnhnms]] approach a utopia; the others have significant dystopian aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houston|first=Chlöe|date=2007|title=Utopia, Dystopia or Anti-utopia?

Many works combine elements of both utopias and dystopias. Typically, an observer from our world will journey to another place or time and see one society the author considers ideal, and another representing the worst possible outcome. The point is usually that the choices we make now may lead to a better or worse potential future world. [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[Always Coming Home]]'' fulfills this model, as does [[Marge Piercy]]'s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]''. In [[Starhawk]]'s ''[[The Fifth Sacred Thing]]'' there is no time-travelling observer, but her ideal society is invaded by a neighbouring power embodying evil repression. In [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'', in many ways a counterpoint to his better-known ''[[Brave New World]]'', the fusion of the best parts of [[Buddhist philosophy]] and Western technology is threatened by the &quot;invasion&quot; of oil companies. As another example, in the &quot;Unwanteds&quot; series by Lisa McMann, a paradox occurs where the outcasts from a complete dystopia are treated to absolute utopia, and therefore believe that those who were privileged in said dystopia were actually the unlucky ones.

In another literary model, the imagined society journeys between elements of utopia and dystopia over the course of the novel or film. At the beginning of ''[[The Giver]]'' by [[Lois Lowry]], the world is described as a utopia, but as the book progresses, the world's dystopian aspects are revealed.

The Ismaili were part of the Durbar of the [[Mughal Empire|Moghul Empire]], with high-ranking members of their community called [[Khoja]].  Their community including the other communities of the Muslims of South Asia had become leaderless after the year 1857 when the Mughal Empire was abolished.

The Ismaili began settling in Bombay when the [[British Raj]] had established itself.

Modern works on the Nizaris have elucidated their history and, in doing so, dispelled popular histories from the past as mere legends. In 1933, under the direction of the [[Imam]] [[Aga Khan III|Sultan Muhammad Shah]], [[Aga Khan III]], the Islamic Research Association was developed. Historian Vladimir Ivanov was central to both this institution and the 1946 Ismaili Society of [[Bombay]]. Cataloguing a number of Ismaili texts, Ivanov provided the ground for great strides in modern Isma'ili scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary 1998, p. 17&quot;/&gt;

Ismaili leaders would later support the cause of [[Pakistan]] during the partition and have a considerable presence in that country.

In recent years, Peter Willey has provided interesting evidence that goes against the Assassin folklore of earlier scholars. Drawing on its established esoteric doctrine, Willey asserts that the Ismaili understanding of Paradise is a deeply symbolic one. While the [[Qur'an]]ic description of Heaven includes natural imagery, Willey argues that no Nizari ''fida'i'' would seriously believe that he was witnessing Paradise simply by awakening in a beauteous garden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willey, p. 55&quot;&gt;Willey, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The Nizaris' symbolic interpretation of the Qur'anic description of Paradise serves as evidence against the possibility of such an exotic garden used as motivation for the devotees to carry out their armed missions. Furthermore, Willey points out that a courtier of [[Hulagu Khan]], [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]], surveyed the Alamut castle just before the Mongol invasion. In his reports about the fortress, there are elaborate descriptions of sophisticated storage facilities and the famous Alamut library. However, even this anti-Ismaili historian makes no mention of the gardens on the Alamut grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willey, p. 55&quot;/&gt; Having destroyed a number of texts in the library's collection, deemed by Juvayni to be heretical, it would be expected that he would pay significant attention to the Nizari gardens, particularly if they were the site of drug use and temptation. Having not once mentioned such gardens, Willey concludes that there is no sound evidence in favour of these legends.

According to the historian [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], the [[Böszörmény]], (Izmaleita or Ismaili/[[Nizari]]) denomination of Muslims who lived in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] from the 10th to the 13th centuries, were employed as mercenaries by the kings of Hungary. However, following the establishment of the Christian [[Kingdom of Hungary]], their community was vanquished by the end of the 13th century due to the [[Inquisition]]s ordered by the Catholic Church during the reign of [[Coloman, King of Hungary]]. It is said that the Assassins are the ancestors of those given the surname Hajaly, derived from the word &quot;hajal&quot;, a rare species of bird found in the mountains of Syria near [[Masyaf]]. The [[Chukar Partridge|hajal]] (bird) was often used as a symbol of the Assassin's order.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==In popular culture==
{{details|Assassins in popular culture}}
The Assassins were part of Medieval culture, and they were either demonized or romanticized. The Hashashin appeared frequently in the art and literature of the Middle Ages, sometimes illustrated as one of the knight's archenemies and as a quintessential villain during the crusades.&lt;ref&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

The word Assassin, in variant forms, had already passed into European usage in this general sense as a term for a hired professional murderer. The Italian chronicler [[Giovanni Villani]], who died in 1348, tells how the lord of Lucca sent 'his assassins' (i suoi assassini) to Pisa to kill a troublesome enemy there. Even earlier, [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], in a passing reference in the 19th canto of the ''[[Dante's Inferno|Inferno]]'', speaks of 'the treacherous assassin' (lo perfido assassin); his fourteenth-century commentator Francesco da Buti, explaining a term which for some readers at the time may still have been strange and obscure, remarks: 'Assassino è colui che uccide altrui per danari' (An assassin is one who kills others for money).&lt;ref&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widespread awareness of the Assassins in modern Europe, and their incorporation into the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]], was created by Austrian historian and [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] through his 1818 book, ''Die Geschichte der Assassinen aus morgenländischen Quellen''&lt;ref&gt;Stuttgart und Tübingen, 1818&lt;/ref&gt; (translated into English in 1835 as ''The History of the Assassins''&lt;ref&gt;London, 1835; translated by O.C. Wood&lt;/ref&gt;). This work was the standard one on the history of the Assassins in the West until the 1930s.

The Assassins appear in many [[role-playing game]]s and [[video game]]s, especially in [[massively multiplayer online game]]s. The [[Assassin (character class)|assassin character class]] is a common feature of many such games, usually specializing in single combat and stealth skills, often combined in order to defeat an opponent without exposing the assassin to counter-attack.

* The ''[[Exile (1988 video game series)|Exile]]'' series of [[action role-playing game]]s revolves around a time-traveling Syrian Assassin who assassinates various religious historical figures and modern world leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/exile/exile.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Exile / XZR|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|date=April 11, 2009|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date=August 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo Chan, [http://www.neoseeker.com/news/12552-sunsoft-scores-telenet-japan-franchises/ Sunsoft scores Telenet Japan franchises], Neoseeker, December 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' video game series portrays a heavily fictionalized Ḥashshāshīn order, which has expanded beyond its Levantine confines and is depicted to have existed throughout recorded history (along with their nemesis, the [[Knights Templar]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/12/the-history-of-assassins-creed The History of Assassin's Creed by IGN]&lt;/ref&gt; Both orders are presented as fundamentally philosophical, rather than as religious, in nature, and are expressly said to predate the faiths that their real-life counterparts arose from, thus allowing for the expansion of their respective &quot;histories&quot; both before and after their factual time-frames. However, ''Assassin's Creed'' draws much of its content from historical facts, and even incorporates as the creed itself the purported last words from [[Hassan i Sabbah]]: &quot;Nothing is true; everything is permitted&quot; (though the sources for that quote are largely unreliable). The series has since developed into a franchise, comprising novels, comic books, and a [[Assassin's Creed (film)|film]].
* In the ''Sword of Islam'' [[Downloadable content|DLC]] for [[Paradox Interactive]]'s [[grand strategy]] game ''[[Crusader Kings II]]'', the Hashashin are a holy order associated with [[Shi'a Islam]]. Once established, Shi'ite rulers may hire the Hashashin to fight against non-Shi'a realms, and can potentially [[vassal]]ize them. The ''Monks and Mystics'' DLC expands their role, making the Assassins a unique secret society that Shi'a characters may join.
* In the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Marco Polo (TV series)|Marco Polo]]'', the emperor [[Kublai Khan]] is attacked by a group of assassins, which is said to be the work of the Hashshashin, who are led by the Old Man of the Mountain according to the Taoist monk [[Hundred Eyes]], in the King's court. The Old Man of the Mountain is then pursued by Marco Polo and Byamba. The episode Hashshashin (2014) shows how the Old Man leads Marco Polo into a hallucinogenic state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3798176/plotsummary &quot;Marco Polo&quot; Hashshashin (TV Episode 2014) - Plot Summary - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Louis L'Amour]], in his book ''[[The Walking Drum]]'', used the assassins and the stronghold of Alamut as the location of his main character's enslaved father. Mathurin Kerbouchard, who initially seeks his father in the 12th century Moor-controlled Spain, then throughout Europe, must ultimately travel to the Stronghold of Alamut in order to rescue Jean Kerbouchard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/walkingdrumthe00loui |title=The walking drum |last=L'Amour |first=Louis |date=1984 |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=9780553249231 |location=Toronto |oclc=12268583 |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Faceless men, a guild of assassins in the book series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' by [[George R. R. Martin]] and in the TV series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' are inspired by the Order of Assassins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/game-of-thrones/256205/the-real-history-of-game-of-thrones-the-faceless-men|title=The real history of game of thrones the faceless men|last=Sokol|first=Tony|date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dota 2, [[multiplayer online battle arena]] contains a character named ''Lanaya'', who is described as a &quot;Templar Assassin&quot;.
* The ''[[Fate/stay night|Fate]]'' franchise of [[visual novels]] features the sect quite prominently with [[Hassan-i Sabbah|Hassan-i-sabbah]], also known as the &quot;Old Man of the Mountain&quot; ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 山の翁, Yama no Okina), being a pseudonym of 19 [[Ghost|wraith]]s able to be summoned into the assassin class. Their Noble Phantasm is called Zabaniya (in Japanese: ザバーニーヤ), from [[Arabic]] (Az-zabānīya: الزبانية), named after [[Zabaniyya|the 19 Angels that guard Hell in the Islamic faith]]. In both ''[[Fate/Zero]]'' and ''[[Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel]]'', 'Assassin' is a character (servant of [[Kotomine Kirei]] and [[Matō Zouken]] respectively) that portrays a leader of Hashashins. Hassan-i Sabbah himself features in ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]''.

For instructions on correctly submitting feature requests and bug reports, see [[wikipedia:bug reports]].

Since UI design stuff has taken up a huge chunk of [[wikipedia:ignored feature requests]], I'm moving them to their own page. Go wild!

Older material can be found at [[Wikipedia:Phase II feature requests/Interface]]

== Ignored feature requests ==

2002 2 25  I really like the idea of having different colors   for all the user pages, talk pages and wikipedia pages. However, could a better color scheme be used? Really, lime green for the wiki pages, and salmon pink for the user pages (I do hate pink) are just horrid choices! And the blue of the talk pages makes it difficult to tell where hyperlinks are when your settings are set to ''not'' underline them. But the concept is real cool and will be most useful. I will play around with some colors and report back in a day a two. [[user:maveric149|maveric149]] 
::I '''hate''' the idea of colors.  The web is busy enough as it is, and wikipedia is a '''major''' busyness offender.  Colors are just one more layer of not very interesting information between us and the TEXT.  I'm here for the text, people.  The interface can go play somewhere else.  Metawikipedia? [[user:MichaelTinkler|MichaelTinkler]]

::I'm a relatively new contributor, but as a design student and extensive user of online encyclopedia's, I have to say that almost any implementation of color and/or graphical features is going to make this place more desirable for those looking for a professional resource.  Right now, the design is geared almost 100% toward the editing end and very little toward the user end.  Personally, if I were designing it, I would make the top frame thinner with a more horizontal orientation of the logo and give both it and the side menu some type of cohesive color scheme (blue with a compliment perhaps).  I would also suggest making the default font the verdana, arial, helvetica family because it's much cleaner and easier to read than the seriffed times new roman.  [[user:Jazzoctopus|Jazzoctopus]]

:::I'd be quite annoyed to get Helvetica after choosing the very readable Lucida Bright in my browser. I agree with you about the size of the top section though; I had the UseMod Wiki set up to have ''only'' the title and logo at the top, with everything else down the bottom out of the way. --[[user:Carey Evans|Carey Evans]]

* I would suggest that the colors be made considerably paler - they ''do'' interfere with the hyperlinks - and that the main article pages should be backed by plain white.  Being able to ''read'' the pages is, after all, the most important aspect, with all else secondary to that. [[user:-- April|-- April]]

:How about leaving the main text area of ''all'' pages white, and ''only'' have different color schemes for the top, side and bottom menubars? The more I think about, the more I am being convinced that having any color other than white for the main text area is a bad thing. I do alot of work in :Talk pages with tables with their own color schemes before I place the tables in the article. Now with the different background colors, the eye is tricked, and anything you work on that has color on a :Talk page will look ''very'' different when you place it in the article. [[user:maveric149|maveric149]]  

:How about a setting in preferences so I can turn off these colors altogether? The current scheme is truly awful, but no matter what it's replaced with it's going to look bad for ''someone''. Really, do we need to be hit over the head like this about what sort of namespace any given article is in? [[user:Bryan Derksen|Bryan Derksen]]

:An alternative would be just a coloured bar down one side, which looks quite neat, IMHO of course. Something like &quot;html { border-left: thick solid green; }&quot; in the CSS stylesheet for this page, for example. --[[user:Carey Evans|Carey Evans]]

::What I'd love to see is for the people who'd like to see something specifically different in the interface to take a page from the wiki, save the HTML, modify it to their heart's content, and post it for everyone to see. Then if people publicly admit to liking it (as opposed to every change to the live code which is met only with scattered complaints), we foolish blind programmers will have something concrete and pre-approved to put into the code! --[[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]] 2002/02/25

::I agree that the main text area should have a white background, but the sides and top should have some interesting color to create a contrast.  The problem with leaving it plain and making the user edit it to their choice is that a casual user won't do that and just think it's a plain, boring looking website.  And I still think that most web designers agree that the arial family of fonts is clearer and more professional for websites. [[user:Jazzoctopus|Jazzoctopus]]

'''Alternate designs'''

Fair enough, [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion]]. I've put together a few pages, which are living at http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/c.evans/wp/ for now. The most useful link there is the Talk link at the bottom of the page, that explains it a bit. I haven't tested it in IE, and I know it won't look as good in Netscape 4. --[[user:Carey Evans|Carey Evans]], 2002-02-27
:I looks nice with IE as well. But, even though the top part in this wiki might be too large, the one in yours seems too small. No edit/Main Page/Recent Changes link (try that on a very long page!), no info about how you're logged in, no search box, and you'd definitely want to have some kind of horizontal line there to divide the header from the rest of the page. The &quot;think colored line&quot; thing is very nice, though. I agree to change the background color of the text back to white on all pages. Either we let the header/footer/QuickBar change the color, or we use the &quot;thick colored line&quot; thing. --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
::On every Wiki I know, I can hit the &quot;End&quot; key to get all the page functions. Wikipedia, and Usemod wikis before I turn it off, are the only Wikis I can think of off-hand that put so much info between the title and the content. With just title, byline, content, I don't see why a horizontal line is necessary, although it's nice with a whole control panel at the top. --Carey

:Thanks, Carey! It looks great (I, too, love the line along the edge), but I have to agree with Magnus that *some* info at the top is darn useful. When I use the non-English wikipedias which are still on the old code, I go mad looking for the edit link at the top... (Also, the edit links seem to be broken.) This situation might be improved upon with a decent sidebar; one that's a little cleaner looking and only takes up space at the top (ie, float:right). Perhaps the sidebar might be a chunk which includes the logo? Just a thought. --[[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]
::The edit links aren't supposed to work, I might think about the edit page and other special pages later. The logo itself is currently in a separate floating &amp;lt;div&gt;, so it shouldn't be much trouble to try adding text below the image. However, I wonder how a floating div and floating table like in [[Beryllium]] will interact? --Carey
:::Surprisingly enough, [http://leuksman.com/misc/Beryllium.html not half as ugly] as I imagined. However it's less than ideal, perhaps; the table is much longer than the sidebar, so it doesn't wrap and we get a big blank space. Of course, not as big as we have now where the sidebar lasts the entire length of the page! --Brion

:Netscape 6: the blue bar down the left is good, but I don't like the font: it comes across as too big, and unattractive. The latter is, of course, subjective. [[user:Vicki Rosenzweig|Vicki Rosenzweig]]
::The font was the default sans-serif font specified in Edit &amp;rarr; Preferences... &amp;rarr; Appearance &amp;rarr; Fonts &amp;rarr; Sans-serif, which probably ''is'' big and ugly by default. I've changed it back the to default browser font for now, however. --Carey

:Parts of it are certainly an improvement on the current design, but it still has a text-only, techie look.  I'm working on a prospective design that I'll have up for you to all see in a day or so.  I still have a fair amount of my own school designing to do. : ) [[user:Jazzoctopus|Jazzoctopus]]
::Techie web page design is what I do best. :)

:In my continuing effort to get rid of the links at the top of the page, I've put a magic QuickBar on my [http://localhost/~carey/wp/ sample pages]. Try the button in the top right with a relatively modern browser. --[[user:Carey Evans|Carey Evans]]

::Alas, I don't have your pages on my local machine. :) I think you mean your [http://home.clear.net.ns/pages/c.evans/wp sample pages]... The pop-up menu is interesting and definitely a cool effect, but I suspect it would be non-obvious. As someone who ''isn't'' terribly familiar with other wikis, I find that having the various navigation &amp;amp; whatnot functions immediately visible is a good thing. At the bottom or hidden away in a submenu means that new users won't notice them. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

Ok, all, here's the design I've come up with.  [[http://ecoop.uc.edu/students/daviscp/wiki/]] It retains most of the current design with a couple of graphic enhancements and a slightly different organization.  It's just a sample page, so many of the links don't work. [[user:Jazzoctopus|Jazzoctopus]]
:Nice one! Might be a little confusing for newcomers, though. And, changing the logo (which looks good on the page) is not a good idea since we don't want to have totally different logos for the same site, now do we? IMHO, this should become a skin to choose on the user preferences. Accidentially, I just changed statistics so it shows how many people use a certain skin, so I'd say give the community some choices, and then we'll make the most popular one the standard (I know the current standard will have a slight advantage;). --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

:Nice! A few comments: The title of the page is not at all obvious. I'd move it down into the white space with the rest of the content, and try to make the header take up a bit less space. Also, all the links in the right hand column are scrunched up and broken onto two lines each on the browsers I tried. The font's tiny too, on my current browser, but on others I tried the top bar was spread out and taller than the logo, which looked a bit strange. --[[user:Carey Evans|Carey Evans]]

:Pretty! I have to agree with Carey though, the article title needs to be more prominent, and all the text in the sidebar is wrapped. '''Font sizes vary from platform to platform, from browser to browser, and from user to user.''' Consider also the non-English wikipedias, which may have longer names for some of those functions. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

:Oh, and another thing, folks. Please remember we'll need room in the design for links to the other-language wikipedias. These haven't been put into many articles yet (in part because the links go to broken pages on most of the other wikis running the old software), but for an example see the article on [[Esperanto]] with links to the article in 5 other languages. In the current design they're pretty weighty; using both local and English names for the languages is probably going to be too much, I'd recommend pruning it down to just the local name -- Français, Deutsch, etc -- if people can read the language, they can recognise the local name, no? or even just language codes (fr, de, etc) perhaps with a tiny flag icon or something. (Of course, people will hate more little colored things at the top of the screen, so flags are probably a bad idea.) [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

(See also [[user:Marian|Marian's excellent UI redesign proposal]].)

Nice and fast work on the Cologne Blue skin (the first cut at Marian's UI, I assume).  Here are a few suggestions, based on my browser, IE 5.5: 
* drop the font size on the &quot;WIKIPEDIA&quot; banner text from +4 to +3
* drop the font size on the topic headline (which looks nice in the Verdana gray) from 8 to 6
* in the second table, the one enclosing both the options bar on the left, as well as the body text, kick the cell spacing up to 5 or so, which gets the whitespace closer to Marian's
* in the options bar table, drop the cell spacing to 0, but kick the cell padding to 5, maybe, which will give you a continous bar with some spacing structure in it. [[User:ClaudeMuncey]]

Cologne Blue lacks two essential features:
* the ability to edit a redirect page
* the ability to go from a Talk: page to a main namespace page
I'm switching back to the default.

Currently wikipedia is fairly COLOR-BLIND-FRIENDLY.  Please keep this in mind for any future enhancements or changes to wikipedia.  There are a number of websites that offer tips on having a color-blind-friendly website.  As a red/green color-blind person myself, I can tell you that if the font and background are certain shades, I cannot distinguish the font from the background to read it! [[User:BoNoMoJo|B]]

How about Geocities-ad-style collapsible menu-sections on the left sidebar? You could fit more options in that way. It would clean up the interface a whole lot.

Also, [[user:Tim_Starling|Tim Starling]] has proposed the use of smart (javascript?) context menus, so that right clicking on a user's link would have options like 'user contributions'. I think this feature would be invaluable, but we need to allow for the simpler and older browsers out there, so any such addition would have to come with a major wikipedia overhaul, testing and the ability to disable the feature in preferences. - [[User:Mark|Mark]] 05:30, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)

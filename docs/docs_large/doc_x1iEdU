=== Grammar ===
In common with other languages, whether spoken or signed, BSL has its own [[grammar]] which govern how phrases are signed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;/&gt; BSL has a particular [[syntax]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;/&gt; One important component of BSL is its use of [[Pro-form|proforms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;/&gt; A proform is “...any form that stands in the place of, or does the job of, some other form.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;/&gt; Sentences are composed of two parts, in order: the subject and the predicate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;/&gt; The subject is the topic of the sentence, while the predicate is the commentary about the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;/&gt;

BSL uses a [[topic–comment]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cohearentvision.org.uk/deaf-users/grammatical-structure-of-british-sign-language/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130423190807/http://www.cohearentvision.org.uk/deaf-users/grammatical-structure-of-british-sign-language/|url-status=dead|title=Grammatical Structure of British Sign Language · coHearentVision|date=23 April 2013|archivedate=23 April 2013|website=archive.is}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topic-comment means that the topic of the signed conversation is first established, followed by an elaboration of the topic, being the 'comment' component.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;/&gt; The canonical word order outside of the topic–comment structure is [[object–subject–verb]] (OSV), and noun phrases are head-initial.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Linguistics of British Sign Language: An Introduction|author1=Sutton-Spence, R.|author2=Woll, B.|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521637183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUsCbazTICIC|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationships with other sign languages ===
Although the United Kingdom and the United States share [[English language|English]] as the predominant [[oral language]], British Sign Language is quite distinct from [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) - having only 31% signs identical, or 44% cognate.&lt;ref&gt;McKee, D. &amp; G. Kennedy (2000). Lexical Comparison of Signs from American, Australian, British, and New Zealand Sign Languages. In K. Emmorey and H. Lane (Eds), &quot;The signs of language revisited: an anthology to honor Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima&quot;. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; BSL is also distinct from [[Irish Sign Language]] (ISL) (ISG in the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] system) which is more closely related to [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and ASL.

It is also distinct from [[Signed English]], a manually coded method expressed to represent the [[English language]].

The sign languages used in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]], respectively, evolved largely from 19th century BSL, and all retain the same manual alphabet and grammar and possess similar lexicons. These three languages may technically be considered dialects of a single language ([[BANZSL]]) due to their use of the same grammar and manual alphabet and the high degree of lexical sharing (overlap of signs). The term BANZSL was coined by [[Trevor Johnston]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, T. (2002). BSL, Auslan and NZSL: Three sign languages or one? In A. Baker, B. van den Bogaerde &amp; O. Crasborn (Eds.), &quot;Cross-linguistic perspectives in sign language research: Selected papers from TISLR 2000&quot; (pp. 47-69). Hamburg: Signum Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; and Adam Schembri.

In Australia deaf schools were established by educated deaf people from London, Edinburgh and Dublin. This introduced the London and Edinburgh dialects of BSL to Melbourne and Sydney respectively and Irish Sign Language to Sydney in Roman Catholic schools for the deaf. The language contact post secondary education between Australian ISL users and 'Australian BSL' users accounts for some of the dialectal differences we see between modern BSL and Auslan. Tertiary education in the US for some deaf Australian adults also accounts for some ASL borrowings found in modern Auslan.

Auslan, BSL and NZSL have 82% of signs identical (using concepts from a [[Swadesh list]]). When considering similar or related signs as well as identical, they are 98% cognate. Further information will be available after the completion of the [http://www.bslcorpusproject.org BSL corpus] is completed and allows for comparison with the [http://www.auslan.org.au/about/corpus/ Auslan corpus] and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081224104404/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/research/deafstudies/DSRU%20site/NZSL%20variation/variation%20project.aspx Sociolinguistic Variation in New Zealand Sign Language project ]. There continues to be language contact between BSL, Auslan and NZSL through migration (deaf people and interpreters), the media (television programmes such as See Hear, Switch, Rush and SignPost are often recorded and shared informally in all three countries) and conferences (the World Federation of the Deaf Conference – WFD – in Brisbane 1999 saw many British deaf people travelling to Australia).

[[Makaton]], a communication system for people with cognitive impairments or other communication difficulties, was originally developed with signs borrowed from British Sign Language. The sign language used in [[Sri Lanka]] is also closely related to BSL despite the oral language not being English, demonstrating the distance between sign languages and spoken ones.

BSL users campaigned [[Recognition of sign languages|to have BSL recognised]] on an official level. BSL was recognised as a language in its own right by the UK government on 18 March 2003, but it has no legal protection. There is, however, legislation requiring the provision of interpreters such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

== Usage ==
BSL has many regional [[dialect]]s. Certain signs used in [[Scotland]], for example, may not be understood immediately, or not understood at all, by those in Southern England, or vice versa. Some signs are even more local, occurring only in certain towns or cities (such as the Manchester system of number signs). Likewise, some may go in or out of fashion, or evolve over time, just as terms in oral languages do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Linguistics of British Sign Language: An Introduction|last1 = Sutton-Spence|first1 = Rachel|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1998|isbn = 0521631424|pages = 24–25|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lUsCbazTICIC&amp;q=british%20sign%20language%20older&amp;pg=PA24|last2 = Woll|first2 = Bencie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Families may have signs unique to them to accommodate for certain situations or to describe an object that may otherwise require fingerspelling.

Many British television channels broadcast programmes with in-vision signing, using BSL, as well as specially made programmes aimed mainly at [[Deaf culture|deaf]] people such as the [[BBC]]'s ''[[See Hear]]'' and [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[VEE-TV]]''.

[[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] broadcasts in-vision signing at 07:00-07:45, 08:00-08:20 and 13:00-13:45 GMT/BST each weekday. [[BBC Two]] also broadcasts in-vision signed repeats of the channel's primetime programmes between 00:00 and 02:00 each weekday. All BBC channels (excluding BBC One, BBC Alba and BBC Parliament) provide in-vision signing for some of their programmes.

BSL is used in some educational establishments, but is not always the policy for deaf children in some local authority areas. The Let's Sign BSL and [[fingerspelling]] graphics are being developed for use in education by deaf educators and tutors and include many of the regional signs referred to above.

In [[Northern Ireland]], there are about 4,500 users of BSL and 1,500 users of [[Irish Sign Language]], an unrelated sign language. A hybrid version, dubbed &quot;[[Northern Ireland Sign Language]]&quot; is also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicireland.net/tag/bsl-northern-ireland-sign-language-at-all-public-masses/|title=BSL Northern Ireland Sign Language at all public Masses.

In 2019, over 100 signs for scientific terms, including '[[deoxyribonucleotide]]' and '[[deoxyribonucleoside]]', were added to BSL, after being conceived by Liam Mcmulkin, a deaf graduate of the [[University of Dundee]], who had found finger-spelling such words tiresome, during his degree course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=Hazel |title=What's deoxyribonucleotide in sign language? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-49057331 |accessdate=3 August 2019 |date=21 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Number of BSL users ==
In 2016 the British Deaf Association says that, based on official statistics, it believes there are 151,000 people who use BSL in the UK, and 87,000 of these are deaf. This figure does not include professional BSL users, interpreters, translators, etc. unless they use BSL at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bda.org.uk/help-resources/|title=Help &amp; Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Learning British Sign Language ==
British Sign Language can be learnt throughout the UK and three examination systems exist.  Courses are provided by community colleges, local centres for deaf people and private organisations.  Most tutors are native users of sign language{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} and hold a relevant teaching qualification.

=== Becoming a BSL / English interpreter ===
There are two qualification routes: via post-graduate studies, or via [[National Vocational Qualifications]].  [[Deaf Studies]] undergraduate courses with specific streams for sign language interpreting exist at several British universities; post-graduate level interpreting diplomas are also on offer from universities and one private company. Course entry requirements vary from no previous knowledge of BSL to NVQ level 6 BSL (or equivalent).

The qualification process allows interpreters to register with the National Registers of Communication Professionals with Deaf and Deafblind People (NRCPD), a voluntary regulator. Registrants are asked to self-certify that they have both cleared a DBS ([[Disclosure and Barring Service]]) check and are covered by professional indemnity insurance. Completing a level 3 BSL language assessment and enrolling on an approved interpreting course allows applications to register as a TSLI (Trainee Sign Language Interpreter). After completing an approved interpreting course, trainees can then apply to achieve RSLI (Registered Sign Language Interpreter) status. RSLIs are currently required by NRCPD to log Continuous Professional Development activities. Post-qualification, specialist training is still considered necessary to work in specific critical domains.

=== Communication Support Workers ===
Communication Support Workers (CSWs) are professionals who support the communication of deaf students in education at all ages, and deaf people in many areas of work, using British Sign Language and other communication methods such as [[Sign Supported English]]. The qualifications and experience of CSWs varies: some are fully qualified interpreters, others are not.

==Let Sign Shine==
Let Sign Shine is a campaign started by Norfolk teenager Jade Chapman to raise the awareness of British Sign Language (BSL) and attract signatures for a petition for BSL to be taught in schools. The campaign's petition to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] has attracted support from over four thousand people.

Chapman was nominated for the Bernard Matthews Youth Award 2014 for her work and devotion to raising awareness of the importance of sign language. Chapman won the education award category and was presented with an award by Olympic swimmer [[Rebecca Adlington]].&lt;ref&gt;East Anglian Daily Press, [http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/photo_gallery_incredible_young_people_from_norfolk_and_suffolk_are_honoured_with_special_awards_1_3824453], Photo Gallery: Incredible young people from Norfolk and Suffolk are honoured with special awards.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman was also awarded an Outstanding Achievement Award from the [[Radio Norwich 99.9]] Local Hero Awards on 7 October 2015. The award ceremony featured a performance by [[Alesha Dixon]].&lt;ref&gt;Let Sign Shine, [http://letsignshine.com/radio-norwich-local-hero-awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308161123/http://letsignshine.com/radio-norwich-local-hero-awards |date=8 March 2016 }}, Norwich Radio Local Hero Award.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been donated £1,000 from the Bernard Matthews Youth Award, Let Sign Shine used this to start a British Sign Language course at [[Dereham Neatherd High School]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-32334171], Teenage campaigner Jade Chapman sets up sign language course with prize.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Standard model of particle physics}}

The '''Standard Model''' of [[particle physics]] is the theory describing three of the four known [[fundamental force]]s (the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], [[Weak interaction|weak]], and [[Strong interaction|strong]] interactions, and not including the [[gravity|gravitational force]]) in the [[universe]], as well as classifying all known [[elementary particle]]s. It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists around the world,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon [[experimental confirmation]] of the existence of [[quark]]s.  Since then, confirmation of the [[top quark]] (1995), the [[tau neutrino]] (2000), and the [[Higgs boson]] (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of [[weak neutral current]]s and the [[W and Z bosons]] with great accuracy.

Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent&lt;ref&gt;In fact, there are mathematical issues regarding quantum field theories still under debate (see e.g. [[Landau pole]]), but the predictions extracted from the Standard Model by current methods applicable to current experiments are all self-consistent. For a further discussion see e.g. Chapter 25 of {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has demonstrated huge successes in providing [[experimental prediction]]s, it leaves some [[Physics beyond the standard model|phenomena unexplained]] and falls short of being a [[theory of everything|complete theory of fundamental interactions]]. It does not fully explain [[baryon asymmetry]], incorporate the full [[theory of gravitation]]&lt;ref name = DarkMatter&gt;Sean Carroll, PhD, Caltech, 2007, The Teaching Company, ''Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The Dark Side of the Universe'', Guidebook Part 2 page 59, Accessed 7 Oct. 2013, &quot;...Standard Model of Particle Physics: The modern theory of elementary particles and their interactions ... It does not, strictly speaking, include gravity, although it's often convenient to include gravitons among the known particles of nature...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as described by [[general relativity]], or account for the [[accelerating expansion of the Universe]] as possibly described by [[dark energy]].  The model does not contain any viable [[dark matter]] particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]]. It also does not incorporate [[neutrino oscillation]]s and their non-zero masses.

The development of the Standard Model was driven by [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] and [[Experimental physics|experimental]] particle physicists alike. For theorists, the Standard Model is a paradigm of a [[quantum field theory]], which exhibits a wide range of phenomena including [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], [[Anomaly (physics)|anomalies]] and non-perturbative behavior. It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate [[hypothetical particle]]s, [[extra dimensions]], and elaborate symmetries (such as [[supersymmetry]]) in an attempt to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.

== Overview ==

At present, [[matter]] and [[energy]] are best understood in terms of the [[kinematics]] and [[fundamental interaction|interactions]] of elementary particles. To date, physics has reduced the [[scientific law|laws]] governing the behavior and interaction of all known forms of matter and energy to a small set of fundamental laws and theories. A major goal of physics is to find the &quot;common ground&quot; that would unite all of these theories into one integrated [[theory of everything]], of which all the other known laws would be special cases, and from which the behavior of all matter and energy could be derived (at least in principle).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Details can be worked out if the situation is simple enough for us to make an approximation, which is almost never, but often we can understand more or less what is happening.&quot; from ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'', Vol 1. pp. 2–7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Particle content ==

The Standard Model includes members of several classes of elementary particles, which in turn can be distinguished by other characteristics, such as [[color charge]].

All particles can be summarized as follows:

The Standard Model includes 12 [[elementary particle]]s of [[Spin (physics)|spin]] {{1/2}}, known as [[fermion]]s. According to the [[spin–statistics theorem]], fermions respect the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Each fermion has a corresponding [[antiparticle]].

Fermions are classified according to how they interact (or equivalently, by what [[charge (physics)|charges]] they carry). There are six [[quark]]s ([[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], [[charm quark|charm]], [[strange quark|strange]], [[top quark|top]], [[bottom quark|bottom]]), and six [[lepton]]s ([[electron]], [[electron neutrino]], [[muon]], [[muon neutrino]], [[tau (particle)|tau]], [[tau neutrino]]). Each class is divided into pairs of particles that exhibit a similar physical behavior called a [[Generation (particle physics)|generation]] (see the table).

The defining property of quarks is that they carry [[color charge]], and hence interact via the [[strong interaction]]. The phenomenon of [[color confinement]] results in quarks being very strongly bound to one another, forming color-neutral composite particles called [[hadron]]s that contain either a quark and an antiquark ([[meson]]s) or three quarks ([[baryon]]s). The lightest baryons are the [[proton]] and the [[neutron]]. Quarks also carry [[electric charge]] and [[weak isospin]]. Hence they interact with other fermions via [[electromagnetism]] and the [[weak interaction]]. The remaining six fermions do not carry color charge and are called leptons. The three [[neutrino]]s do not carry electric charge either, so their motion is directly influenced only by the [[weak interaction|weak nuclear force]], which makes them notoriously difficult to detect. By contrast, by virtue of carrying an electric charge, the electron, muon, and tau all interact electromagnetically.

Each member of a generation has greater mass than the corresponding particles of lower generations. The first-generation charged particles do not decay, hence all ordinary ([[baryon]]ic) matter is made of such particles. Specifically, all atoms consist of electrons orbiting around [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], ultimately constituted of up and down quarks. On the other hand, second- and third-generation charged particles decay with very short half-lives and are observed only in very high-energy environments. Neutrinos of all generations also do not decay and pervade the universe, but rarely interact with baryonic matter.

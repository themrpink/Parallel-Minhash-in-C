In his film score for ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939) and consequently in his collection ''Music for the Movies'' (1942), American composer [[Aaron Copland]] titled a section of the score &quot;Threshing Machines,&quot; to suit a scene in the [[Lewis Milestone]] film where Curley is threatening Slim over giving May a puppy, when many of the itinerant worker men are standing around or working on threshers.

In the song &quot;Thrasher&quot; from the album ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'', [[Neil Young]] compares the modern threshing machine's technique of separating wheat from wheat stalks to the natural forces of time that separate close friends from one another.

Threshing machines appear in [[Twenty One Pilots]]' music video for the song &quot;[[House of Gold (Twenty One Pilots song)|House of Gold]]&quot;.

{{audio|Moss.ogg|'''Moss'''}} is a coastal [[List of cities in Norway|town]] and a [[Municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Viken (county)|Viken]] [[Counties of Norway|county]], [[Norway]]. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Moss. The city of Moss was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). The rural municipality of [[Jeløy]] was merged with the city on 1 July 1943.  The former municipality of [[Rygge]] was merged into it on January 1, 2020.

Its administrative district covers areas east of the town, such as the island of [[Dillingøy]] in the lake [[Vansjø]]. Parts of the town are located on the peninsula of Jeløy. Moss city has 30,723 inhabitants (2012).

==Name==
The [[Old Norse]] form of the name was ''Mors''. It may be derived from an old root ''mer-'' which means to &quot;divide&quot; or &quot;split&quot;.

The adjacent topography shares similar etymology:
* [[Mosse-elva]]. Mosse -&quot;marsh-river-border&quot;+ Elva -&quot;see Elbe, ''Elver'' Old Norse for river&quot; The name is thought to be very old and the meaning of it is not clear.
* [[Mosse-sundet]]. Mosse-&quot;marsh-river-border&quot;+ Sundet (Moss [[Channel (geography)|channel]]).
* [[Mosse-herred]]. Mosse-&quot;marsh-river-border&quot;+ Herred -&quot;Court&quot; akin to hort(us,en), &quot;garden,&quot; from PIE *ghr-ti-, from base *gher- &quot;to grasp, enclose&quot; (see yard) Actually &quot;Moss county&quot;.

==History==
Archeological finds suggest that there were settlements in the area more than 7,000 years ago and continuously through the [[Iron Age]], [[Viking Age]], through to modern times. During the Viking era, the place was known as ''Varna'' (forne, vorne, front-protection?) and was the site of a cooperative for battleships held by local warlords on behalf of the king.
[[Image:Moss Ironworks main office2005-20-03.jpg|thumb|left|Moss Ironworks, the signingplace of [[Convention of Moss]]]]
[[Image:Moss 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Moss in 1885]]

The first literary reference to the name Mo(u)ſs(ß) is from Bishop Eystein Aslaksson's [[Cadastre|Red book]] (NRA AM fol. 328) from 1396, and by then the town had become a commercial center with craftsmen and mills. By the 16th century, the town's port was significant enough to warrant its own customs official. Liquor [[Distillation|distilleries]] became one of the dominant industries, and it was not until 1607, after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], that the town got its own church.

By 1700, Moss had become a hub for both ship and land traffic between [[Copenhagen]] and [[Oslo|Christiania]], and in 1704 [[Moss Jernverk]] (Moss Ironworks) was established just north of the city center. By 1720 it received its charter as a merchant town, with its own official. This may have had background in an important battle in 1716 that was fought in the town square in Moss in which Norwegian troops commanded by [[Vincent Budde]] prevailed over invading Swedish forces, sent by [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] to capture [[Akershus Fortress]]. In 1767 a local resident built a &quot;pleasure pavilion&quot; near the town, which survives as the Hotel [[Refsnes Gods]].&lt;ref name=fromm&gt;

In 1814, Moss became the site for the signing of the [[Convention of Moss]], which effectively put an end to the [[Denmark–Norway|Dano-Norwegian]] kingdom. This set the stage for economic development that has persisted to this day.

On the morning of 14 July 2006, a [[Meteoroid|bolide]] exploded above the nearby town of Rygge - moments later, several stony [[meteorite]]s fell over Moss. A number of meteorites were recovered by local residents and visiting meteorite hunters, which after analysis and classification, were found to be a rare type of [[carbonaceous chondrite]].

===Coat-of-arms===
The [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] is from modern times. They were granted on 2 April 1954. Moss became a separate city in 1786 and received its first seal in the same year. The seal showed a church under some clouds, the whole thing placed within a circle. Above the circle there were some [[fasces]], the freedom symbol of the late 19th century. A later seal, dating from around 1829, shows the same composition, but now also with six [[bird]]s flying around the church.

When in the 1930s the city wanted to adopt a coat-of-arms and the birds were chosen as a possible symbol. The original birds probably were [[dove]]s, symbol of peace. In 1934, the idea of the [[crow]] was launched, since the nickname of the inhabitants was 'crows'. The arms were finally granted in 1954 and show a yellow crow on a red background. It was designed by Christian Stenersen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Norske Kommunevåpen|year=1990|title=Nye kommunevåbener i Norden|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/m/moss.htm|accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moss.kommune.no/artikkel.aspx?MId1=3607&amp;AId=292&amp;back=1|title=Kråke som byvåpen|accessdate=2008-12-16|publisher=Moss Kommune|language=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003143601/http://www.moss.kommune.no/artikkel.aspx?MId1=3607&amp;AId=292&amp;back=1|archive-date=2011-10-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tale being told in Moss about the Church fire: The city of Moss always had a lot of crows, most likely because of the corn being harvested in the region. The fire disturbed the crows that started to make a lot of noise and the inhabitants rescued the church from total destruction. After this episode the idea of [[crow]] as arms was launched.

===Norwegian lady statues===
Moss and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] in the United States are [[sister cities]]. On Good Friday, 27 March 1891, the Norwegian bark ''Dictator'', whose home port was Moss, was lost in the treacherous waters of the [[Graveyard of the Atlantic]]. The ship had been en route to England from [[Pensacola, Florida]] with a cargo of Georgia Pine [[lumber]]. After being caught and disabled in a storm, she was headed for port at [[Hampton Roads, Virginia|Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] to make repairs when she encountered another storm just off Virginia Beach.

Working in the high winds and seas, lifesaving crews from shore were able to save some of the 17 persons aboard. However, the pregnant wife of Captain J.M. Jorgensen, Johanne, and their 4-year-old son Carl were among the 7 persons who drowned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qsl.net/vbarc/news/1999/mar99.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship's wooden female [[figurehead]] had washed ashore. It was placed in a vertical position facing the ocean near the [[boardwalk]] as a memorial to those who lost their lives in the [[shipwreck]]. It was a landmark there for more than 60 years, but gradually became weathered and eroded.

In 1962, Norwegian sculptor [[Ørnulf Bast]] was commissioned to create two nine-foot bronze replicas of the original figurehead by the City of Moss. The [[Norwegian Lady Statues]] were unveiled on 22 September 1962. One was presented as a gift to Virginia Beach, and an exact duplicate was erected in Moss to unite the two sister cities. Each statue gives the appearance of facing the other across the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

On 13 October 1995, [[Queen Sonja of Norway]] visited the Norwegian Lady statue in Virginia Beach, and placed memorial flowers.

==Industry==
The town is known for [[paper mill]]s, as well as [[Metalworking|metalworks]] and other factories. Dillingøy is known as a place for alternative non-military [[civil service]]. Moss is mentioned since the [[Renaissance]] and was the site of the signing of the Convention of Moss in 1814, which solidified the union with Sweden. The headquarters of textile producer [[Helly Hansen]] were located in Moss until 2009. The maker of international hotel keycards, Trio Ving, also has their headquarters here.

==Transport==
The railway [[Østfold Line]] runs through Moss, stopping at [[Moss Station]], which is the southern terminus of one service of the [[Oslo Commuter Rail]] and an intermediate stop for regional trains. Moss connects across the [[Oslofjord]] to [[Horten]] via the [[Moss–Horten Ferry]]. There are also bus-lines to [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Oslo]] in addition to local bus lines. Moss port is one of the top 3 busiest container ports in Norway (messured in [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEUs]]).

==Health care==
Together with Østfold Kalnes Hospital, Østfold Moss Hospital covers general health care services for the municipality. The hospital is a modern unit for planned operations. There is a large outpatient and inpatient activity in a number of disciplines, in the field of somatics and mental health care as well as an operation department for both inpatient and day surgery. There is an eye department, imaging services, blood sampling and blood bank and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sykehuset Østfold Moss |url=https://sykehuset-ostfold.no/steder/sykehuset-ostfold-moss|accessdate=31 May 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality also has three health stations - City center, Bredsand and Kambo health stations.

==Sport==
[[Moss FK]] are the Town's football club. They play in the Second Division, and have played in the Norwegian Premier League as recently as 2002.

*Moss is known throughout Norway for the local &quot;dish&quot; &quot;Pølse i Vaffel&quot; - sausage in waffle. The dish consists of a [[Vienna Sausage]] served in a Scandinavian style waffle with ketchup and mustard. The dish was most likely created in the 1960s, but this is widely discussed. [[Eyvind Hellstrøm]] - who later became a Michelin-star chef - and his brother Jan is often referred to as the creators.

__NOTOC__
'''Marl''' or '''marlstone''' is  a [[carbonate mineral|carbonate]]-rich mud or [[mudstone]] which contains variable amounts of [[Clay minerals|clays]] and [[silt]]. The term was originally loosely applied to a variety of materials, most of which occur as loose, earthy deposits consisting chiefly of an intimate mixture of clay and [[calcium carbonate]],&lt;ref name=&quot;boggs-2006-172&quot;&gt;Boggs (2006), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; formed under freshwater conditions. These typically contain 35–65% clay and 65–35% carbonate.{{sfnp|Pettijohn|1957|pp=368-369}}&lt;ref name=&quot;blatt-tracy-1996-217&quot;&gt;Blatt and Tracy (1996), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The term is today often used to describe [[Friability|indurated]] marine deposits and [[Lake|lacustrine]] (lake) [[sediment]]s which more accurately should be named 'marlstone'.{{sfnp|Pettijohn|1957|p=410-411}}

Marlstone is an indurated (resists crumbling or powdering) rock of about the same composition as marl, more correctly called an earthy or impure [[argillaceous minerals|argillaceous]] [[limestone]]. It has a blocky [[conchoidal|subconchoidal]] fracture, and is less [[Fissility (geology)|fissile]] than [[shale]].{{sfnp|Pettijohn|1957|p=410-411}}  The dominant carbonate mineral in most marls is [[calcite]], but other carbonate minerals such as [[aragonite]] or [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] may be present.{{sfnp|Perri|Dominici|Critelli|2015}}

[[Image:Marl vs clay &amp; lime EN.PNG|300px|right|thumb|Scheme of the transitional lithotypes from mud (or mudstone) to lime (or limestone), illustrating the definition of marl (marlstone) as a mix of calcium carbonate and clay]]

The lower [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] units of the [[chalk]] [[White cliffs of Dover|cliffs of Dover]] consist of a sequence of [[glauconite|glauconitic]] marls followed by rhythmically banded limestone and marl layers. The [[Channel Tunnel]] follows these marl layers between France and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Harris|1996|p=57}} Upper [[Cretaceous]] cyclic sequences in [[Germany]] and marl–[[opal]]-rich [[Tortonian]]-[[Messinian]] strata in the [[Sorbas basin]] related to multiple sea drawdown have been correlated with [[Milankovitch cycle|Milankovitch]] orbital forcing.{{sfnp|Krijgsman|2001}}

Marl as lacustrine sediment is common in post-[[glacial lake]]-bed sediments.{{sfnp|Murphy|Wilkinson|1980}}&lt;ref name=&quot;parker-2005&quot;&gt;Parker (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Wiik|Bennion|Sayer|Davidson|McGowan|Patmore|Clarke|2015}} ''[[Chara (alga)|Chara]]'', a macroalga also known as stonewort, thrives in shallow lakes with high pH and alkalinity, where its stems and fruiting bodies become calcified. After the alga dies, the calcified stems and fruiting bodies break down into fine carbonate particles that mingle with silt and clay to produce marl.&lt;ref name=&quot;leeder-2011-663&quot;&gt;Leeder (2011), p. 663&lt;/ref&gt; Marl ponds of the northeastern United States are often [[kettle pond]]s in areas of limestone bedrock that become poor in nutrients ([[oligotrophic]]) due to precipitation of essential [[phosphate]]. Normal pond life is unable to survive, and skeletons of freshwater mollluscs such as ''[[Sphaerium]]'' and ''[[Planorbis]]'' accumulate as part of the bottom marl.&lt;ref name=&quot;parker-2005&quot;/&gt;

Marl has been used as a soil conditioner and acid soil neutralizing agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;parker-2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;msu-2015&quot;&gt;Warncke (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Marl from the [[Marlbrook Marl]] is used for the manufacture of cement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ags-2020&quot;&gt;Arkansas Geological Survey (2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic geology==
===Historical use in agriculture===
Marl was extensively mined in Central New Jersey as a soil conditioner in the 1800s. In 1863, the most common marl was blue marl. While the specific composition and properties of the marl varied depending on what layer it was found in, blue marl was generally composed of 38.70% [[silicic acid]] and sand, 30.67% [[oxide of iron]], 13.91% [[lime (material)|carbonate of lime]], 11.22% water, 4.47% [[potash]], 1.21% [[Periclase|magnesia]], 1.14% [[phosphoric acid]], and 0.31% [[sulphuric acid]].{{sfnp|Geological Survey of New Jersey|1887}}

Marl was in high demand for farms. An example of the amount of marl mined comes from a report from 1880, from [[Marlboro Township, New Jersey|Marlboro]], Monmouth County, New Jersey, which reported the following tons of marl sold during the year:{{sfnp|Geological Survey of New Jersey|1880|p=184}}
* OC Herbert Marl Pit – 9961 tons
* Uriah Smock Marl Pit – 4750 tons
* CM Conover Marl Pit – 760 tons

In the [[Centennial Exhibition]] report in 1877, marl is described in many different forms{{sfnp|Woll|1896|p=295}} and came from 69 marl pits in and around New Jersey. The report identified a number of agricultural marls types, including clay marl, blue marl, red marl, high bank marl, shell layer marl, under shell layer marl, sand marl, green marl, gray marl, and clayey marl.{{sfnp|New Jersey State Centennial Board|1877|p=203}}

===Modern agricultural and aquacultural uses===
Marl continues to be used for agriculture into the 21st century, though less frequently.&lt;ref name=&quot;morse-smith-2011&quot;&gt;Morse and Smith (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of application must be adjusted for the reduced content of calcium carbonate versus straight lime, expressed as the calcium carbonate equivalent. Because the carbonate in marl is predominantly calcium carbonate, [[magnesium]] deficiency may be seen in crops treated with marl if they are not also supplemented with magnesium.&lt;ref name=&quot;msu-2015&quot;/&gt;

Marl has been used in [[Pamlico Sound]] to provide a suitable artificial substrate for [[oyster]]s in a reef-like environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;morse-smith-2011&quot;/&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=June 2009|bot=yes}}
In [[grammar]], an '''adessive case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''ade'''}}; from Latin ''[[wikt:adesse|adesse]]'' &quot;to be present (at)&quot;: ''ad'' &quot;at&quot; + ''esse'' &quot;to be&quot;) is a [[grammatical case]] generally denoting location at, upon, or adjacent to the [[referent]] of the noun; the term is most frequently used in [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] studies. In Uralic languages, such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] is the fourth of the locative [[declension|cases]] with the basic meaning of &quot;on&quot;. For example, Estonian ''laud'' (table) and ''laual'' (on the table), Hungarian ''asztal'' and ''asztalnál'' (at the table).&lt;ref&gt;However, unlike its Finnic relatives, the adessive in Hungarian does not specifically carry the meaning &quot;on (top of)&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as an [[instrumental case]] in Finnish.

In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the suffix is ''-lla/-llä'', e.g. ''pöytä'' (table) and ''pöydällä'' (on the table). In addition, it can specify &quot;being around the place&quot;, as in ''koululla'' (at the school including the schoolyard), as contrasted with the inessive ''koulussa'' (in the school, inside the building). 

In Estonian, the ending ''-l'' is added to the [[genitive case]], e.g. ''laud'' (table) - ''laual'' (on the table). Besides the meaning &quot;on&quot;, this case is also used to indicate ownership. For example, &quot;mehe''l'' on auto&quot; means &quot;the man owns a car&quot;.

As the Uralic languages don't possess the verb &quot;to have&quot;, it is the subject in the adessive case + ''on'' (for example, ''minulla on'', &quot;I have&quot;, literally &quot;at me is&quot;).

{{Wiktionary|adessive case}}
The other locative cases in Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian are:
*[[Inessive case]] (&quot;in&quot;)
*[[Elative case]] (&quot;out of&quot;)
*[[Illative case]] (&quot;into&quot;)
*[[Allative case]] (&quot;onto&quot;)
*[[Ablative case]] (&quot;off&quot;)
*[[Superessive case]] (&quot;on top of, or on the surface of&quot;)

==Finnish==

The Finnish adessive has the word ending -lla or -llä (according to the rules of [[vowel harmony]]). It is usually added to nouns and associated adjectives. 

It is used in the following ways.

* Expressing the static state of being on the surface of something. 
:Possible English meanings of ''on, on top of, atop'' 
:: kynä on pöydällä ''the pen is on the table''  

*As an [[existential clause]] with the verb ''olla'' (to be) to express possession
:This is the Finnish way to express the English verb ''to have''
::Meillä on koira  ''we have a dog ('on our (possession, responsibility, etc.) is dog')''

* Expressing the instrumentive use of something
:Possible English meanings of ''with, by, using''
::Hän meni Helsinkiin junalla  ''he went to Helsinki by train''
::Hän osti sen eurolla ''he bought it for a euro''

* In certain time expressions expressing the '''time''' at which things take place
:Possible English meanings of ''during'' '''in''' '''over''' 
::aamulla  ''in the morning'' keväällä ''in the spring''

* Expressing the general proximity in space or time at which something takes place (where the more specific proximity case would be the inessive)
:Possible English meaning of ''at''
::poikani on koululla  ''my son is at school'' (c.f. inessive case: poikani on koulussa ''my son is inside the school'') 
::hän on ruokatunnilla ''he is at lunch'' - literally on the lunch hour
:::(Although not strictly a use of the adessive this proximity difference is mirrored in adverbial forms such as täällä - around here and tässä - right here)

* In certain expressions expressing mood
::Janne oli huonolla tuulella   ''Janne was in a bad mood''

{{Special characters}}

In [[grammar]], the '''allative case''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ə|t|ɪ|v}}; [[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''all'''}}; from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''allāt-'', ''afferre'' &quot;to bring to&quot;) is a type of [[locative case|locative]] [[grammatical case]]. The term '''allative''' is generally used for the [[lative case]] in the majority of languages that do not make finer distinctions.

==Finnish==
In the [[Finnish language]] (Uralic language), the allative is the fifth of the locative [[declension|cases]], with the basic meaning of &quot;onto&quot;. Its ending is ''-lle'', for example ''pöytä'' (table) and ''pöydälle'' (onto the top of the table). In addition, it is the logical complement of the [[adessive case]] for referring to &quot;being around the place&quot;. For example, ''koululle'' means &quot;to the vicinity of the school&quot;. With time, the use is the same: ''ruokatunti'' (lunch break) and ''... lähti ruokatunnille'' (&quot;... left to the lunch break&quot;). Some actions require the case, e.g. ''kävely'' - ''mennä kävelylle'' &quot;a walk - go for a walk&quot;. It also means &quot;to&quot; or &quot;for&quot;, for example ''minä'' (me) and ''minulle'' (to/for me).

The other locative cases in Finnish and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] are these:
*[[Inessive case]] (&quot;in&quot;)
*[[Elative case]] (&quot;out of&quot;)
*[[Illative case]] (&quot;into&quot;)
*[[Adessive case]] (&quot;on&quot;)
*[[Ablative case]] (&quot;from off&quot;)

==Baltic languages==
In the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language]]s the allative had been used dialectally as an innovation since the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]], but it is almost out of use in modern times. Its ending in Lithuanian is ''-op'' which was shortened from ''-opi'', whereas its ending in Latvian is ''-up''. In the modern languages the remains of the allative can be found in certain fixed expressions that have become [[adverb]]s, such as Lithuanian ''išėjo Dievop'' (&quot;gone to God&quot;, i.e. died), ''velniop!'' (&quot;to hell!&quot;), ''nuteisti myriop'' (&quot;[[death sentence|sentence to death]]&quot;), ''rudeniop'' (&quot;towards autumn&quot;), ''vakarop'' (&quot;towards the evening&quot;), Latvian ''mājup'' (&quot;towards home&quot;), ''kalnup'' (&quot;uphill&quot;), ''lejup'' (&quot;downhill&quot;).{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

==Greek==
In [[Mycenaean Greek]], a ''-de'' ending is used to denote an allative, when it is not being used as an [[enclitic]],&lt;ref&gt;Ventris, Michael and John Chadwick. ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek''&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. ''te-qa-de'', *''Tʰēgʷasde'', &quot;to [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]&quot; ([[Linear B]]: {{lang|gmy|𐀳𐀣𐀆}}). This ending survives into [[Ancient Greek]] in words such as ''Athḗnaze'',&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*)aqh/naze|Ἀθήναζε|ref|mLSJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from accusative ''Athḗnās'' + ''-de''.

==Biblical Hebrew==
In Biblical Hebrew the so-called directional ''he'' (or ''he locale'') in the form of ה ָ– /-ɔh/ suffixed to nouns (often place names) also functions as an allative marker, usually translated as 'to' or 'toward'.&lt;ref&gt;Waltke, Bruce, and Michael O'Connor, ''Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax'' (Winonana Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1990), 185-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English==
In [[Modern English]], the [[suffix]] ''-ward/-wards'' can be regarded as similar to a newly-developed limited form of allative case. It indicates motion direction in some  adjectives and adverbs that derive from some limited set of nouns.

==Wanyi==
[[Wanyi language|Wanyi]], an extinct [[Australian language]], had the allative suffixes ''-[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-kurru#Wanyi kurru/wurru]''.

==Latin==
The [[Latin]] accusative of towns and small islands is used for motion towards&lt;ref&gt;Allen and Greenough, sect. 427&lt;/ref&gt; in a way that is analogous to the allative case.

== Udmurt ==
In the [[Udmurt language]], words inflected with the allative (often called &quot;approximative&quot; in Permic languages) case ending &quot;-лань&quot; /ɫɑɲ/ express the direction of a movement.

__NOTOC__
Year '''238''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCXXXVIII]]''') was a [[common year starting on Monday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Pius and Pontianus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 991 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 238 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

In [[grammar]], the '''essive case''', or '''similaris case''', ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''ess'''}}) is a [[grammatical case]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, William, John Archibald, Mark Aronoff, and Janie Rees-Miller. &quot;Morphology: The Analysis of Word Structure.&quot; Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction. 6th ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The essive case on a [[noun]] can express it as a definite period of time during which something happens or during which a continuous action was completed. It can also denote a form as a temporary location, state of being, or character in which the subject was at a given time. The latter meaning is often referred to as the equivalent of the English phrase &quot;as a __&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niemi&quot;&gt;Niemi, Clemens. Finnish Grammar. 3rd ed. Duluth, MN: C.H. Salminen, 1945. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finnish==
In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], it is marked by adding &quot;-na/-nä&quot; (depending on the [[Vowel harmony#Finnish|vowel harmony]]) to the stem of the noun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niemi&quot;/&gt;
:Examples:
:''{{lang|fi|lapsi}}'' &quot;child&quot; → ''lapsena'' &quot;as a child&quot;, &quot;when (I) was a child&quot;.

:Veljeni on säveltäjänä &quot;My brother is a composer (at somewhere or a certain kind of).&quot;
:cf: ''Veljeni on säveltäjä'' ('''Nom''') (My brother is a composer) vs. ''Veljeni on säveltäjänä'' ('''Ess''') (My brother works/acts as composer (somewhere))
:''{{lang|fi|säveltäjä}}'' &quot;composer&quot; → ''{{lang|fi|säveltäjänä}}'' &quot;state of being a composer (the given time is the present)&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Niemi&quot;/&gt;
:Example: '''{{lang|fi|Veljeni on säveltäjänä orkesterissa}}'' &quot;My brother is a composer in an orchestra&quot;.
:Example: '''{{lang|fi|Veljeni on säveltäjänä ainutlaatuinen}}'' &quot;As a composer my brother is unique&quot;.

:Sain kirjeen viime maanantaina. &quot;I received the letter last Monday.&quot;
:''{{lang|fi|maanantai}}'' &quot;Monday&quot; → ''{{lang|fi|maanantaina}}'' &quot;Monday (referring to the time when the action was completed)&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Niemi&quot;/&gt;

Use of the essive case for specifying times, days and dates when something happens is also apparent in Finnish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niemi&quot;/&gt;
:Example: '''{{lang|fi|kuudentena joulukuuta}}'' &quot;on 6 December&quot;.

In Finnish, the essive case is technically categorized as an old locative case, a case that, in some way, indicates spatial location. However, in the present language, the case has lost the majority of its spatial meaning. The case instead typically denotes a state that is temporary or inclined to change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niemi&quot;/&gt;

Some fixed expressions retain the essive in its ancient [[locative case|locative]] meaning, however: &quot;at home&quot; is ''kotona''.  
:Example: ''{{lang|fi|Luen lehtiä kotona.}}'' &quot;I read newspapers at home.&quot;

In the presence of a family history of MFS (as defined above):
# [[Ectopia lentis]]
# Systemic score* ≥ 7
# Aortic root Z-score ≥ 2

*Points for systemic score:
** Wrist AND thumb sign = 3 (wrist OR thumb sign = 1)
** Pectus carinatum deformity = 2 (pectus excavatum or chest asymmetry = 1)
** Hindfoot deformity = 2 (plain pes planus = 1)
** [[Dural ectasia]] = 2
** [[Protrusio acetabuli]] = 2
** [[pneumothorax]] = 2
** Reduced upper segment/lower segment ratio AND increased arm/height AND no severe scoliosis = 1
** [[Scoliosis]] or thoracolumbar [[kyphosis]] = 1
** Reduced elbow extension = 1

** [[Mitral valve prolapse]] = 1

The thumb sign (Steinberg's sign) is elicited by asking the person to [[flexion|flex]] the thumb as far as possible and then close the fingers over it. A positive thumb sign is where the entire distal [[Phalanx bone|phalanx]] is visible beyond the [[ulna]]r border of the hand, caused by a combination of hypermobility of the thumb as well as a thumb which is longer than usual.

The wrist sign (Walker-Murdoch sign) is elicited by asking the person to curl the thumb and fingers of one hand around the other wrist. A positive wrist sign is where the little finger and the thumb overlap, caused by a combination of thin wrists and long fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Julia A. McMillan, Ralph D. Feigin, Catherine DeAngelis, M. Douglas Jones. ''Oski's Pediatrics: Principles &amp; Practice''. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
Many other disorders can produce the same type of body characteristics as Marfan syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Rimoin DL, Connor JM, Pyeritz RE, etal |title=Emery and RImoin's Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics. 5th ed.|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|publisher=Churchill Livingstone Elsevier|year=2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic testing and evaluating other signs and symptoms can help to differentiate these. The following are some of the disorders that can manifest as &quot;marfanoid&quot;:
* [[Arachnodactyly|Congenital contractural arachnodactyly]] or Beals syndrome
* [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]]
* [[Homocystinuria]]
* [[Loeys–Dietz syndrome]]
* [[MASS phenotype]]
* [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b|Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B]]
* [[Shprintzen–Goldberg syndrome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greally|GeneReviews|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stickler syndrome]]

==Management==
There is no cure for Marfan syndrome, but life expectancy has increased significantly over the last few decades{{When|date=June 2017}} and is now similar to that of the average person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/marfan_syndrome/ |title=Questions and Answers about Marfan Syndrome |publisher=Niams.nih.gov |access-date=23 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409161405/http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Marfan_Syndrome/ |archive-date=9 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular checkups are recommended to monitor the health of the heart valves and the [[aorta]]. Marfan syndrome is treated by addressing each issue as it arises and, in particular, preventive medication even for young children to slow progression of aortic dilation. The goal of this treatment strategy is to slow the progression of aortic dilation and prevent any damage to heart valves by eliminating [[Cardiac arrhythmia|heart arrythmias]], minimizing the [[heart rate]], and lowering the person's [[blood pressure]].

=== Physical activity ===
The [[American Heart Association]] made the following recommendations for people with Marfan syndrome with no or mild aortic dilation:&lt;ref name=&quot;Maron2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=AHA Scientific Statement: Recommendations for Physical Activity and Recreational Sports Participation for Young Patients With Genetic Cardiovascular Diseases |vauthors=Maron BJ, Chaitman BR, Ackerman MJ, Bayés de Luna A, Corrado D, Crosson JE, Deal BJ, Driscoll DJ, Estes NA, Araújo CG, Liang DH, Mitten MJ, Myerburg RJ, Pelliccia A, Thompson PD, Towbin JA, Van Camp SP |journal=Circulation |date=8 June 2004 |volume=109 |issue=22 |pages=2807–2816 |pmid=15184297 |doi=10.1161/01.cir.0000128363.85581.e1 |issn=0009-7322 |oclc=110943757 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Probably permissible activities: bowling, golf, skating (but not ice hockey), snorkeling, brisk walking, treadmill, stationary biking, modest hiking, and doubles tennis.
* Intermediate risk: basketball (both full- and half-court), racquetball, squash, running (sprinting and jogging), skiing (downhill and cross-country), soccer, singles tennis, touch (flag) football, baseball, softball, biking, lap swimming, motorcycling, and horseback riding.
* High risk: bodybuilding, weightlifting (non-free and free weights), ice hockey, rock climbing, windsurfing,  surfing, and scuba diving.

===Medication===
Management often includes the use of [[beta blocker]]s such as [[propranolol]] or if not tolerated [[calcium channel blocker]]s or [[ACE inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref name=NORD2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2010Tx/&gt; Beta blockers are used to reduce the stress exerted on the aorta and to decrease aortic dilation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

===Surgery===
If the dilation of the aorta progresses to a significant-diameter [[aneurysm]], causes a dissection or a rupture, or leads to failure of the aortic or other valve, then surgery (possibly a [[Bentall procedure|composite aortic valve graft]] or [[valve-sparing aortic root replacement]]) becomes necessary. Although aortic graft surgery (or any vascular surgery) is a serious undertaking it is generally successful if undertaken on an elective basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/852571020057CCF6852573E1005A0BDC|title=Elective Aortic Root Surgery in Marfan Syndrome Appears Safe and Durable: Presented at STS|date=January 31, 2008|publisher=Doctor's Guide|access-date=January 13, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120151335/http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/852571020057CCF6852573E1005A0BDC|archive-date=November 20, 2008}}&lt;br /&gt;See also:

The skeletal and ocular manifestations of Marfan syndrome can also be serious, although not life-threatening. These symptoms are usually treated in an appropriate manner for the condition, such as with pain medications or [[muscle relaxant]]s. Because Marfan syndrome may cause asymptomatic spinal abnormalities, any spinal surgery contemplated on a person Marfan should only follow detailed imaging and careful surgical planning, regardless of the indication for surgery. The ocular complications of MFS can often be treated with surgery. [[Ectopia lentis]] can be treated, as artificial lenses can be surgically implanted. In addition, surgery can address [[glaucoma]] and [[cataract]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Treatment of a spontaneous pneumothorax is dependent on the volume of air in the pleural space and the natural progression of the individual's condition. A small pneumothorax might resolve without active treatment in one to two weeks. Recurrent pneumothoraces might require chest surgery. Moderately sized pneumothoraces might need [[Chest tube|chest drain]] management for several days in a hospital. Large pneumothoraces are likely to be medical emergencies requiring emergency decompression.

As an alternative approach, custom-built supports for the aortic root are also being used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tr2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treasure|first1=Tom|last2=Petrou|first2=Mario|last3=Rosendahl|first3=Ulrich|last4=Austin|first4=Conal|last5=Rega|first5=Filip|last6=Pirk|first6=Jan|last7=Pepper|first7=John|title=Personalized external aortic root support: a review of the current status|journal=European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery|date=September 2016|volume=50|issue=3|pages=400–404|doi=10.1093/ejcts/ezw078|pmid=27032474|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2020 this procedure has been used in over 300 people with the first case occurring in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Treasure T, Golesworthy T, Pepper J|title=Practical clinical applications of 3-D printing in cardiovascular surgery|journal=Journal of Thoracic Disease|volume=9|issue=9|pages=2792–2797|date=September 2017|doi=10.21037/jtd.2017.08.63|pmid=29221242|pmc=5708385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nemec |first1=Petr |last2=Pepper |first2=John |last3=Fila |first3=Petr |title=Personalized external aortic root support |journal=Interactive CardioVascular and Thoracic Surgery |date=6 August 2020 |pages=ivaa111 |doi=10.1093/icvts/ivaa111|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnancy===
During pregnancy, even in the absence of preconception cardiovascular abnormality, women with Marfan syndrome are at significant risk of aortic dissection, which is often fatal even when rapidly treated. Women with Marfan syndrome, then, should receive a thorough assessment prior to conception, and [[echocardiography]] should be performed every six to 10 weeks during pregnancy, to assess the aortic root diameter. For most women, safe vaginal delivery is possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;emed&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/946315-print|title=Marfan Syndrome|journal=Cell and Tissue Research|volume=347|issue=1|pages=267–77|year=2007|author=Chen H|access-date=June 25, 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706022447/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/946315-print|archive-date=July 6, 2009|pmid=22105919|doi=10.1007/s00441-011-1270-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prenatal testing]] can be performed in females with Marfan syndrome to determine if the condition has been inherited in their child.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; At 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy, examining a piece of placental tissue through a test called chorionic villus sampling can be performed to make a diagnosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Another prenatal test can be performed called [[amniocentesis]] at 16 to 18 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

Marfan syndrome is expressed dominantly. This means a child with one parent a bearer of the gene has a 50% probability of getting the syndrome. In 1996, the first [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|preimplantation genetic testing]] (PGT) therapy for Marfan was conducted;&lt;ref name=&quot;PGT&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Harton GL, Tsipouras P, Sisson ME, etal |title=Preimplantation genetic testing for Marfan syndrome |journal=Mol. Hum. Reprod. |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=713–15 |year=1996 |pmid=9239687 |doi=10.1093/molehr/2.9.713|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; in essence PGT means conducting a genetic test on early-stage [[in vitro fertilization|IVF]] embryo cells and discarding those embryos affected by the Marfan mutation.

==Prognosis==
Prior to modern cardiovascular surgical techniques and medications such as [[losartan]], and [[metoprolol]], the prognosis of those with Marfan syndrome was not good: a range of untreatable cardiovascular issues was common. Lifespan was reduced by at least a third, and many died in their teens and twenties due to cardiovascular problems. Today, cardiovascular symptoms of Marfan syndrome are still the most significant issues in diagnosis and management of the disease, but adequate prophylactic monitoring and prophylactic therapy offers something approaching a normal lifespan, and more manifestations of the disease are being discovered as more patients live longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keane |first1=Martin G. |last2=Pyeritz |first2=Reed E. |title=Medical Management of Marfan Syndrome |journal=Circulation |issn=1524-4539 |year=2008 |volume=117 |pages=2802–2813 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.693523 |issue=21 |pmid=18506019 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with Marfan syndrome live longer than men.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://omim.org/entry/154700|title=OMIM Entry - # 154700 - MARFAN SYNDROME; MFS|website=omim.org|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marfan syndrome affects males and females equally,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fusar2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fusar-Poli P, Klersy C, Stramesi F, Callegari A, Arbustini E, Politi P |title=Determinants of quality of life in Marfan syndrome |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=243–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18448780 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.49.3.243 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/49/3/243 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713121802/http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/49/3/243 |archive-date=2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mutation shows no ethnic or geographical bias.&lt;ref name=PMID18506019/&gt; Estimates indicate about 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 individuals have Marfan syndrome.&lt;ref name=NORD2017/&gt;

{{Utilitarianism|expanded=Key concepts}}
Within [[economics]], the concept of '''utility''' is used to model worth or value. Its usage has evolved significantly over time. The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or satisfaction within the theory of [[utilitarianism]] by moral philosophers such as [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. The term has been adapted and reapplied within [[neoclassical economics]], which dominates modern economic theory, as a '''utility function''' that represents a consumer's preference ordering over a choice set. Utility has thus become a more abstract concept that is not necessarily solely based on the satisfaction or pleasure received.

== Utility function ==
Consider a set of alternatives facing an individual, and over which the individual has a preference ordering. A '''utility function''' is able to represent those preferences if it is possible to assign a [[real number]] to each alternative, in such a way that ''alternative a'' is assigned a number greater than ''alternative b'' if, and only if, the individual prefers ''alternative a'' to ''alternative b''. In this situation an individual that selects the most preferred alternative available is necessarily also selecting the alternative that maximizes the associated utility function. In general economic terms, a utility function measures preferences concerning a set of goods and services. Often,  utility is correlated with words such as happiness, satisfaction, and welfare, and these are hard to measure mathematically. Thus, economists utilize consumption baskets of preferences in order to measure these abstract, non quantifiable ideas. 

[[Gérard Debreu]] precisely defined the conditions required for a preference ordering to be representable by a utility function.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Debreu|first=Gérard|title=Decision processes|pages=159–167|year=1954|postscript=.|editor-last1=Thrall|editor-first1=Robert M.|contribution=Representation of a preference ordering by a numerical function|location=New York|publisher=Wiley|oclc=639321|ref=harv|editor-last2=Coombs|editor-first2=Clyde H.|editor-last3=Raiffa|editor-first3=Howard|editor-link2=Clyde H. Coombs|editor-link3=Howard Raiffa}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a finite set of alternatives these require only that the preference ordering is complete (so the individual is able to determine which of any two alternatives is preferred, or that they are equally preferred), and that the preference order is [[Transitive relation|transitive]].

In some special applications, such as the conventional theory of Consumer Choice, the Choice Set is not usually finite. In fact, a commonly specified Choice Set in Consumer Choice is &lt;math&gt;R_+^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of perceived commodities in the market of consideration. In this case, there exists a continuous utility function to represent a consumer's preferences if and only if the consumer's preferences are complete, transitive and continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Jehle|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Reny|first2=Philipp|title=Advanced Microeconomic Theory|pages=13–16|year=2011|postscript=.|publisher=Prentice Hall, Financial Times|ISBN=978-0-273-73191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Utility is usually applied by [[economist]]s in such constructs as the [[indifference curve]], which plot the combination of commodities that an individual or a society would accept to maintain a given level of satisfaction. Utility and indifference curves are used by economists to understand the underpinnings of [[demand curve]]s, which are half of the [[supply and demand]] analysis that is used to analyze the workings of [[good (economics)|goods]] markets.

Individual utility and social utility can be construed as the value of a utility function and a [[social welfare function]] respectively.  When coupled with production or commodity constraints, under some assumptions these functions can be used to analyze [[Pareto efficiency]], such as illustrated by [[Edgeworth box]]es in [[contract curve]]s. Such efficiency is a central concept in [[welfare economics]].

In [[finance]], utility is applied to generate an individual's price for an [[asset]] called the [[indifference price]].  Utility functions are also related to [[risk measure]]s, with the most common example being the [[entropic risk measure]].

In the field of [[artificial intelligence]], utility functions are used to convey the value of various outcomes to [[intelligent agent]]s. This allows the agents to plan actions with the goal of maximizing the utility (or &quot;value&quot;) of available choices.

==Revealed preference==
It was recognized that utility could not be measured or observed directly, so instead economists devised a way to infer underlying relative utilities from observed choice. These 'revealed preferences', as termed by [[Paul Samuelson]], were revealed e.g. in people's willingness to pay: &lt;blockquote&gt;Utility is taken to be correlative to Desire or Want. It has been already argued that desires cannot be measured directly, but only indirectly, by the outward phenomena to which they give rise: and that in those cases with which economics is chiefly concerned the measure is found in the price which a person is willing to pay for the fulfillment or satisfaction of his desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alfred |last=Marshall |year=1920 |title=Principles of Economics. An introductory volume |edition=8th |location=London |publisher=Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|78}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=={{Visible anchor|Functions|Utility functions}}==

There has been some controversy over the question whether the utility of a [[commodity]] can be measured or not. At one time, it was assumed that the consumer was able to say exactly how much utility he got from the commodity. The economists who made this assumption belonged to the 'cardinalist school' of economics. Today '''utility functions''', expressing utility as a function of the amounts of the various goods consumed, are treated as either ''cardinal'' or ''ordinal'', depending on whether they are or are not interpreted as providing more information than simply the rank ordering of preferences over bundles of goods, such as information on the strength of preferences.

===Cardinal===
{{Main|Cardinal utility}}

When cardinal utility is used, the magnitude of utility differences is treated as an ethically or behaviorally significant quantity. For example, suppose a cup of orange juice has utility of 120 utils, a cup of tea has a utility of 80 utils, and a cup of water has a utility of 40 utils. With cardinal utility, it can be concluded that the cup of orange juice is better than the cup of tea by exactly the same amount by which the cup of tea is better than the cup of water. Formally speaking, this means that if one has a cup of tea, she would be willing to take any bet with a probability, p, greater than .5 of getting a cup of juice, with a risk of getting a cup of water equal to  1-p. One cannot conclude, however, that the cup of tea is two thirds of the goodness of the cup of juice, because this conclusion would depend not only on magnitudes of utility differences, but also on the &quot;zero&quot; of utility. For example, if the &quot;zero&quot; of utility was located at -40, then a cup of orange juice would be 160 utils more than zero, a cup of tea 120 utils more than zero. Cardinal utility, to economics, can be seen as the assumption that utility can be measured through quantifiable characteristics, such as height, weight, temperature, etc.

[[Neoclassical economics]] has largely retreated from using cardinal utility functions as the basis of economic behavior. A notable exception is in the context of analyzing choice under conditions of risk (see [[#Expected utility|below]]).

Sometimes cardinal utility is used to aggregate utilities across persons, to create a [[social welfare function]].

===Ordinal===
{{Main|Ordinal utility}}

When ordinal utilities are used, differences in utils (values taken on by the utility function) are treated as ethically or behaviorally meaningless:  the utility index encodes a full behavioral ordering between members of a choice set, but tells nothing about the related ''strength of preferences''. In the above example, it would only be possible to say that juice is preferred to tea to water, but no more. Thus, ordinal utility utilizes comparisons, such as &quot;preferred to&quot;, &quot;no more&quot;, &quot;less than&quot;, etc.

Ordinal utility functions are unique [[up to]] increasing [[Monotonic function#Monotonic transformation|monotone (or monotonic) transformations]]. For example, if a function &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is taken as ordinal, it is equivalent to the function &lt;math&gt;u(x)^3&lt;/math&gt;, because taking the 3rd power is an increasing monotone transformation (or monotonic transformation). This means that the ordinal preference induced by these functions is the same (although they are two different functions). In contrast,  cardinal utilities are unique only up to increasing linear transformations, so if &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is taken as cardinal, it is not equivalent to &lt;math&gt;u(x)^3&lt;/math&gt;.

===Preferences===

Although [[Preference (economics)|preference]]s are the conventional foundation of [[microeconomics]], it is often convenient to represent preferences with a utility [[Function (mathematics)|function]] and analyze human behavior indirectly with utility functions.  Let ''X'' be the '''consumption set''', the set of all mutually-exclusive baskets the consumer could conceivably consume.  The consumer's '''utility function''' &lt;math&gt; u\colon X\to \R&lt;/math&gt; ranks each package in the consumption set.  If the consumer strictly prefers ''x'' to ''y'' or is indifferent between them, then &lt;math&gt;u(x)\geq u(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, suppose a consumer's consumption set is ''X'' =&amp;nbsp;{nothing, 1&amp;nbsp;apple,1&amp;nbsp;orange, 1&amp;nbsp;apple and 1&amp;nbsp;orange, 2&amp;nbsp;apples, 2&amp;nbsp;oranges}, and his utility function is ''u''(nothing)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''u''(1&amp;nbsp;apple)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''u''(1&amp;nbsp;orange)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''u''(1&amp;nbsp;apple and 1&amp;nbsp;orange)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, ''u''(2&amp;nbsp;apples)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''u''(2&amp;nbsp;oranges)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.  Then this consumer prefers 1 orange to 1 apple, but prefers one of each to 2 oranges.

In micro-economic models, there are usually a finite set of L commodities, and a consumer may consume an arbitrary amount of each commodity.  This gives a consumption set of &lt;math&gt;\R^L_+&lt;/math&gt;, and each package &lt;math&gt;x \in \R^L_+&lt;/math&gt; is a vector containing the amounts of each commodity.  In the example, there are two commodities: apples and oranges.  If we say apples is the first commodity, and oranges the second, then the consumption set is &lt;math&gt;X =\R^2_+&lt;/math&gt; and ''u''(0,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''u''(1,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''u''(0,&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''u''(1,&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, ''u''(2,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''u''(0,&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 as before.  Note that for ''u'' to be a utility function on&amp;nbsp;''X'', however, it must be defined for every package in&amp;nbsp;''X'', so now the function needs to be defined for fractional apples and oranges too. One function that would fit these numbers is &lt;math&gt; u(x_{apples}, x_{oranges}) = x_{apples} + 2 x_{oranges} + 2x_{apples} x_{oranges}. &lt;/math&gt;

A utility function &lt;math&gt; u\colon X\to \R&lt;/math&gt; '''represents''' a preference relation &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; on X [[if and only if|iff]] for every &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u(x)\leq u(y)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x\preceq  y&lt;/math&gt;.  If u represents &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;, then this implies &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is complete and transitive, and hence rational.

Bienvenüe's project consisted of 10 lines, which correspond to current Line 1 to&amp;nbsp;9. Construction was so intense that by 1920, despite a few changes from schedule, most lines had been completed. The shield method of construction was rejected in favor of the cut-and-cover method in order to speed up work.&lt;ref&gt;Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Bienvenüe, a highly regarded engineer, designed a special procedure of building the tunnels to allow the swift repaving of roads, and is credited with a largely swift and relatively uneventful construction through the difficult and heterogeneous soils and rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p. 150-1,162&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paris Métro Line 1|Line 1]] and [[Paris Métro Line 4|Line 4]] were conceived as central east–west and north–south lines. Two lines, ''ligne 2 Nord'' (Line 2 North) and ''ligne 2 Sud'' (Line 2 South), were also planned but Line 2 South was merged with [[Paris Métro Line 5|Line&amp;nbsp;5]] in 1906. [[Paris Métro Line 3|Line&amp;nbsp;3]] was an additional east–west line to the north of line 1 and line 5 an additional north to south line to the east of Line&amp;nbsp;4. [[Paris Métro Line 6|Line&amp;nbsp;6]] would run from [[Nation (Paris Metro and RER)|Nation]] to [[Place d'Italie (Paris Métro)|Place d'Italie]]. Lines&amp;nbsp;[[Paris Métro Line 7|7]], [[Paris Métro Line 8|8]] and [[Paris Métro Line 9|9]] would connect commercial and office districts around the [[Palais Garnier|Opéra]] to residential areas in the north-east and the south-west. Bienvenüe also planned a circular line, the ''ligne circulaire intérieure'', to connect the six main-line stations. A section opened in 1923 between [[Invalides (Paris Metro and RER)|Invalides]] and the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]] before the plan was abandoned.

=== Nord-Sud competing network ===
{{Main|Nord-Sud Company}}
[[File:Entrée métro de Paris Compagnie Nord-Sud.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''Nord-Sud'' station sign]]
On 31 January 1904, a second concession was granted to the ''Société du chemin de fer électrique souterrain Nord-Sud de Paris'' (Paris North-South underground electrical railway company), abbreviated to the ''Nord-Sud'' (North-South) company. It was responsible for building three proposed lines:
* Line A would join [[Montmartre]] to [[Montparnasse]] as an additional north–south line to the west of Line 4.
* Line B would serve the north-west of Paris by connecting [[Gare Saint-Lazare|Saint-Lazare station]] to Porte de Clichy and Porte de Saint-Ouen.
* Line C would serve the south-west by connecting [[Gare Montparnasse|Montparnasse station]] to [[Porte de Vanves (Paris Métro)|Porte de Vanves]]. The aim was to connect Line B with Line C, but the CMP renamed Line B as Line 13 and Line C as Line 14. Both were connected by the RATP as the current Line&amp;nbsp;13.

Line A was inaugurated on 4 November 1910, after being postponed because of floods in January that year. Line B was inaugurated on 26 February 1911. Because of the high construction costs, the construction of line C was postponed. Nord-Sud and CMP used compatible trains that could be used on both networks, but CMP trains used 600 volts third rail, and NS −600 volts overhead wire and +600 volts third rail. This was necessary because of steep gradients on NS lines. NS distinguished itself from its competitor with the high-quality decoration of its stations, the trains' extreme comfort and pretty lighting.

Nord-Sud did not become profitable and bankruptcy became unavoidable. By the end of 1930, the CMP bought Nord-Sud. Line A became [[Paris Métro Line 12|Line 12]] and Line B [[Paris Métro Line 13|Line&amp;nbsp;13]]. Line C was built and renamed [[Paris Métro Line 14 (1937–76)|Line&amp;nbsp;14]]; that line was reorganised in 1937 with Lines 8 and 10. This partial line is now the south part of Line&amp;nbsp;13.

The last Nord-Sud train set was decommissioned on 15 May 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| language=French |url=http://www.amtuir.org/04_htu_metro_paris/cmp_1968_1983/cmp_1968_1983.htm |title=1968–1983 : le RER et la modernisation du réseau parisien |trans-title=1968–1983: The RER and the modernisation of the parisian network |work=Musée des Transports – Histoire du Métropolitain de Paris |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1930–1950: first inner suburbs are reached ===
[[File:Métro parisien état du réseau en 1939.jpeg|thumb|240px|left|Paris Métro network in 1939]]
Bienvenüe's project was nearly completed during the 1920s. Paris planned three new lines and extensions of most lines to the inner suburbs, despite the reluctance of Parisians. Bienvenüe's inner circular line having been abandoned, the already-built portion between Duroc and Odéon for the creation of a new east–west line that became [[Paris Métro Line 10|Line 10]], extended west to Porte de Saint-Cloud and the inner suburbs of [[Boulogne-Billancourt|Boulogne]].

The line C planned by Nord-Sud between Montparnasse station and [[Porte de Vanves (Paris Métro)|Porte de Vanves]] was built as [[Paris Métro Line 14 before 1976|Line 14]] (different from [[Paris Métro Line 14|present Line&amp;nbsp;14]]). It extended north in encompassing the already-built portion between Invalides and Duroc, initially planned as part of the inner circular. The over-busy [[Belleville funicular tramway]] would be replaced by a new line, [[Paris Métro Line 11|Line 11]], extended to [[Châtelet (Paris Métro)|Châtelet]]. Lines 10, 11 and 14 were thus the three new lines envisaged under this plan.

Most lines would be extended to the inner suburbs. The first to leave the city proper was Line 9, extended in 1934 to [[Boulogne-Billancourt]]; more followed in the 1930s. World War II forced authorities to abandon projects such as the extension of Line 4 and Line 12 to the northern suburbs. By 1949, eight lines had been extended: Line 1 to [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] and [[Vincennes]], Line 3 to [[Levallois-Perret]], Line 5 to [[Pantin]], Line 7 to [[Ivry-sur-Seine]], Line 8 to [[Charenton-le-Pont|Charenton]], Line 9 to Boulogne-Billancourt, Line 11 to [[Les Lilas]] and Line 12 to [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]].

World War II had a massive impact on the Métro. Services were limited and many stations closed. The risk of bombing meant the service between [[Place d'Italie (Paris Métro)|Place d'Italie]] and [[Charles de Gaulle – Étoile (Paris Métro and RER)|Étoile]] was transferred from Line 5 to Line&amp;nbsp;6, so that most of the elevated portions of the Métro would be on Line 6. As a result, Lines 2 and 6 now form a circle. Most stations were too shallow to be used as bomb shelters. The [[French Resistance]] used the tunnels to conduct swift assaults throughout Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

It took a long time to recover after liberation in 1944. Many stations had not reopened by the 1960s and some closed for good. On 23 March 1948, the CMP (the underground) and the STCRP (bus and tramways) merged to form the [[RATP Group|RATP]], which still operates the Métro.

=== 1960–1990: development of the RER ===
[[File:Viaduc Austerlitz Paris 18.jpg|thumb|The [[Viaduc d'Austerlitz]], crossing the [[Seine]], is used by Line 5]]

The network grew saturated during the 1950s. Outdated technology limited the number of trains, which led the RATP to stop extending lines and concentrate on modernisation. The [[MP 51|MP&amp;nbsp;51]] prototype was built, testing both [[rubber-tyred metro]] and basic automatic driving on the ''voie navette''. The first replacements of the older Sprague trains began with experimental articulated trains and then with mainstream rubber-tyred metro [[MP 55|MP&amp;nbsp;55]] and [[MP 59|MP&amp;nbsp;59]], some of the latter still in service (Line 11). Thanks to newer trains and better signalling, trains ran more frequently.

The population boomed from 1950 to 1980. Car ownership became more common and suburbs grew further from the centre of Paris. The main railway stations, termini of the suburban rail lines, were overcrowded during rush hour. The short distance between metro stations slowed the network and made it unprofitable to build extensions. The solution in the 1960s was to revive a project abandoned at the end of the 19th century: joining suburban lines to new underground portions in the city centre as the [[Réseau Express Régional]] (regional express network; RER).

[[File:Saint-Lazare-9-Salle-echang.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saint-Lazare (Paris Métro)|Saint-Lazare station]]]]
The RER plan initially included one east–west line and two north–south lines. RATP bought two unprofitable SNCF lines—the Ligne de Saint-Germain (westbound) and the Ligne de Vincennes (eastbound) with the intention of joining them and to serve multiple districts of central Paris with new underground stations. The new line created by this merger became Line&amp;nbsp;A. The Ligne de Sceaux, which served the southern suburbs and was bought by the CMP in the 1930s, would be extended north to merge with a line of the [[SNCF]] and reach the new [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] in Roissy. This became [[RER B|Line&amp;nbsp;B]]. These new lines were inaugurated in 1977 and their wild success outperformed all the most optimistic forecasts to the extent that line A is the most used urban rail line in the world with nearly 300&amp;nbsp;million journeys a year.

Because of the enormous cost of these two lines, the third planned line was abandoned and the authorities decided that later developments of the RER network would be more cheaply developed by the SNCF, alongside its continued management of other suburban lines. However, the RER developed by the SNCF would never match the success of the RATP's two RER lines. In 1979, the SNCF developed [[RER C|Line C]] by joining the suburban lines of the [[Gare d'Austerlitz]] and [[Gare d'Orsay]], the latter being converted into a museum dedicated to impressionist paintings. During the 1980s, it developed [[RER D|Line&amp;nbsp;D]], which was the second line planned by the initial RER schedule, but serving Châtelet instead of [[République (Paris Métro)|République]] to reduce costs. A huge Métro-RER hub was created at [[Châtelet–Les Halles]], becoming one of the world's largest underground stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aplin|first1=Richard|last2=Montchamp|first2=Joseph|title=Dictionary of Contemporary France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGS2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT109|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-93646-4|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same project of the 1960s also decided to merge Line 13 and Line 14 to create a quick connection between Saint-Lazare and Montparnasse as a new north–south line. Distances between stations on the lengthened line 13 differ from that on other lines in order to make it more &quot;express&quot; and hence to extend it farther in the suburbs. The new [[Paris Métro Line 13|Line&amp;nbsp;13]] was inaugurated on 9 November 1976.

=== 1990–2010: Eole and Météor ===
[[File:Métro Paris station FranklinDRoosevelt aménagement2011.jpg|left|thumb|230px|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt (Paris Métro)|Franklin D. Roosevelt station]] on Line 1]]
In October 1998, [[Paris Métro Line 14|Line 14]] was inaugurated. It was the first fully new Métro line in 63 years. Known during its conception as ''Météor'' (Métro Est-Ouest Rapide), it is one of the two fully automatic lines within the network along with Line 1. It was the first with [[platform screen doors]] to prevent suicides and accidents. It was conceived with extensions to the suburbs in mind, similar to the extensions of the line 13 built during the 1970s. As a result, most of the stations are at least a kilometre apart. Like the RER lines designed by the RATP, nearly all stations offer connections with multiple Métro lines. The line runs between [[Saint-Lazare (Paris Métro)|Saint-Lazare]] and [[Olympiades (Paris Métro)|Olympiades]].

Lines 13 and 7 are the only two on the network to be split in branches. The RATP would like to get rid of those saturated branches in order to improve the network's efficiency. A project existed to attribute to line 14 one branch of each line, and to extend them further into the suburbs. This project was abandoned. In 1999, the [[RER E|RER Line E]] was inaugurated. Known during its conception as Eole (Est-Ouest Liaison Express), it is the fifth RER line. It terminates at [[Haussmann – Saint-Lazare (Paris RER)|Haussmann – Saint-Lazare]], but a new project, financed by EPAD, the public authority managing the [[La Défense]] business district, should extend it west to [[La Défense (Paris Métro, RER and Transilien)|La Défense – Grande Arche]] and the suburbs beyond.

=== 2010 and beyond: automation ===
[[File:Station métro Créteil-Pointe-du-Lac - 20130627 170810.jpg|thumb|[[Pointe du Lac (Paris Métro)|Pointe du Lac station]], opened in 2011]]
In work started in 2007 and completed in November 2011, Line 1 was converted to driverless operation. The line was operated with a combination of driver-operated trains and driver-less trains until the delivery of the last of its driver-less [[MP 05]] trains in February 2013. The same conversion is on-going for Line 4, with an expected completion date in 2022.

Several extensions to the suburbs opened in the last years. Line 8 was extended to [[Pointe du Lac (Paris Métro)|Pointe du Lac]] in 2011, line 12 was extended to [[Front Populaire (Paris Métro)|Aubervilliers]] in 2012 and line 4 was extended to [[Mairie de Montrouge (Paris Métro)|Mairie de Montrouge]] in 2013.

=== Accidents and incidents ===
* 10 August 1903: [[Paris Métro train fire|Couronnes Disaster]] (fire), 84 killed.
* July – October 1995: [[1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings|Paris Métro bombings]] (terror attack), committed by [[Armed Islamic Group (GIA)|Algerian extremists]] – 8 killed and more than 100 injured.
* 30 August 2000: an [[MF 67]] train derailed due to excessive speed and unavailable automatic cruising at [[Notre-Dame-de-Lorette (Paris Métro)|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]], 24 slightly injured.
* 6 August 2005: fire broke out on a train at [[Simplon (Paris Métro)|Simplon]], injuring at least 19 people. Early reports blamed an electrical [[short circuit]] as the cause.
* 29 July 2007: a fire started on a train between [[Varenne (Paris Métro)|Varenne]] and [[Invalides (Paris Métro and RER)|Invalides]]. Fifteen people were injured.

== Network ==
[[File:Carte Métro de Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Paris Métro map]]
Since the Métro was built to comprehensively serve the city inside its walls, the stations are very close: 548 metres apart on average, from 424 m on [[Paris Metro Line 4|Line 4]]&lt;ref&gt;Jean Tricoire, ''Un siècle de métro en 14 lignes'', p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; to one kilometre on the newer line 14, meaning Paris is densely networked with stations.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Tricoire, ''op. cit.'', p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding suburbs are served by later line extensions, thus traffic from one suburb to another must pass through the city. The slow average speed effectively prohibits service to the greater Paris area.

The Métro is mostly underground ({{convert|197|km|disp=or|abbr=on}} of {{convert|214|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Above-ground sections consist of [[elevated railway]] [[viaduct]]s within Paris (on Lines 1, 2, 5 and 6) and the suburban ends of Lines 1, 5, 8, and 13. The tunnels are relatively close to the surface due to the variable nature of the terrain, which complicates deep digging; exceptions include parts of [[Paris Métro Line 12|Line 12]] under the hill of [[Montmartre]] and line 2 under [[Ménilmontant]]. The tunnels follow the twists and turns of the streets above. During construction in 1900, a [[Minimum railway curve radius|minimum radius of curvature]] of just 75 metres was imposed, but even this low standard was not adhered to at [[Bastille (Paris Métro)|Bastille]] and [[Notre-Dame-de-Lorette (Paris Métro)|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]].

Like the [[New York City Subway]] and in contrast with the [[London Underground]] the Paris Métro mostly uses two-way tunnels. As in most French métro and tramway systems, trains drive on the right ([[SNCF]] trains run on the left track). The tracks are standard gauge (1.435 metres). Electric power is supplied by a [[third rail]] which carries 750 [[volts]] [[Direct current|DC]].

The width of the carriages, 2.4 metres, is narrower than that of newer French systems (such as the 2.9 m carriages in Lyon, one of the widest in Europe)&lt;ref name=&quot;Tricoire&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Un siècle de métro en 14 lignes. De Bienvenüe à Météor|author=Jean Tricoire|ref=Référence:Un siècle de métro en 14 lignes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamming&quot;&gt;Clive Lamming, ''Métro insolite''&lt;/ref&gt; and trains on Lines 1, 4 and 14 have capacities of 600-700 passengers; this is as compared with 2,600 on the Altéo MI 2N trains of RER A. The City of Paris deliberately chose the narrow size of the Metro tunnels to prevent the running of main-line trains; the city of Paris and the French state had historically poor relations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to many other historical metro systems (such as New York, Madrid, London, and Boston), all lines have tunnels and operate trains with the same dimensions. Five Paris Métro Lines (1, 4, 6, 11 and 14) run on a rubber tire system developed by the RATP in the 1950s, exported to the [[Montreal Metro|Montreal]], [[Santiago Metro|Santiago]], [[Mexico City Metro|Mexico City]] and [[Lausanne Métro|Lausanne]] metros.

The number of cars in each train varies line by line from three to six; most have five, and eight is possible on [[Paris Metro line 14|Line 14]]. Two lines, 7 and 13, have branches at the end, and trains serve every station on each line except when they are closed for renovations.

=== Opening hours ===
The first train leaves each terminus at 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. On some lines additional trains start from an intermediate station. The last train, often called the &quot;balai&quot; (broom) because it sweeps up remaining passengers, arrives at the [[Terminal station|terminus]] at 1:15&amp;nbsp;a.m., except on Fridays (since 7 December 2007),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratp.fr/common/ressources/1044.pdf Press statement from RATP 2 October 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327073742/http://www.ratp.fr/common/ressources/1044.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saturdays and on nights before a holiday, when the service ends at 2:15&amp;nbsp;a.m.

On [[New Year's Eve]], ''[[Fête de la Musique]]'', ''[[Nuit Blanche]]'' and other events, some stations on Lines 1, 4, 6, 9 and 14 remain open all night.

=== Tickets === &lt;!-- Courtesy note: DAB page [[Carnet]] links here --&gt;
{{see also |Paris ticket &quot;t+&quot;|Public transport fares in the Île-de-France}} &lt;!--[[Île-de-France fare zones]] link in dab removed, as the article does not exist--&gt;
[[File:Ticket t+ stif Paris 2017.jpg|thumb|Ticket &quot;t+&quot;]]

Fares are sold at kiosks and at automated machines in the station foyer. Entrance to platforms is by automated gate, opened by smart cards and simple tickets. Gates return tickets for passengers to retain for the duration of the journey.  There is normally no system to collect or check tickets at the end of the journey, and tickets can be inspected at any point.  The exit from all stations is clearly marked as to the point beyond which possession of a ticket is no longer required.

The standard ticket is ticket &quot;t+&quot;. It is valid for a multi-transfer journey within one and a half hours from the first validation. It can be used on the Métro, buses and trams, and in zone 1 of the RER. It allows unlimited transfers between the same mode of transport (i.e. Métro to Métro, bus to bus and tram to tram), between bus and tram, and between metro and RER zone 1. When transferring between the Metro and the RER, it is necessary to retain the ticket. The RER requires a valid ticket for entry and exit, even for a transfer. It costs €1.90 or ten (a ''carnet'') for €16.90 as of March 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ratp.fr/titres-et-tarifs/ticket-t |title= Accueil – Ticket &quot;t&quot; |publisher=Ratp.info |accessdate=3 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fares use the [[Navigo card]] (the name being a [[portmanteau]] from the French terms ''navigation'' and ''Parigot'', a nickname for Parisians), an [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]]-based [[contactless smart card]]. Fares include:

* daily (''Mobilis''; the ''Ticket Jeunes'', for youth under 26 years on weekends and national holidays, is half the cost of a Mobilis pass);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ratp.info/informer/ticket_jeune.php |title=Accueil –Ticket jeune |publisher=RATP |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* weekly or monthly (the former ''[[Carte orange]]'', sold as the weekly Navigo (&quot;hebdo&quot;) and the monthly Navigo);
* yearly (''Navigo intégrale'', or ''Imagine R'' for students);
* The (''Paris Visite'') travel card is available for one, two, three or five days, for zones 1–3 covering the centre of Paris, or zones 1–5 covering the whole of the network including the RER to the airports, Versailles and Disneyland Paris. It was conceived mainly for visitors and is available through RATP's distributors in the UK, Switzerland and Belgium. It may be a better deal to buy a weekly card (up to €10 saving) but a weekly card runs from Monday to Monday (and is reset every Monday), whereas the Paris Visite card is valid for the number of days purchased.

===Facilities===
On 26 June 2012 it was announced that the Métro would get [[Wi-Fi]] in most stations. Access provided would be free, with a premium paid alternative offer proposed for a faster internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.01net.com/editorial/568481/le-wi-fi-gratuit-arrive-dans-le-metro-parisien Le Wi-Fi gratuit arrive dans le métro parisien] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030091121/http://www.01net.com/editorial/568481/le-wi-fi-gratuit-arrive-dans-le-metro-parisien/ |date=30 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical specifications==
The Métro has  {{convert|214|km|mi}} of track&lt;ref name=&quot;france.fr&quot; /&gt; and 302 stations,&lt;ref name=&quot;Paris-Metro&quot; /&gt; 62 connecting between lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;stif-2005&quot;&gt;''[http://www.stif.info/IMG/pdf/STIF_Les_chiffres_2005.pdf Statistiques Syndicat des transports d'Île-de-France rapport 2005]'' (in French) states 297 stations + Olympiades + Les Agnettes + Les Courtilles {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617083121/http://www.stif.info/IMG/pdf/STIF_Les_chiffres_2005.pdf |date=17 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures do not include the RER network. The average distance between stations is {{convert|562|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Trains stop at all stations.&lt;ref&gt;On 1 January 2006, a test was done with few lines opening at night on main stops only.&lt;/ref&gt; Lines do not share tracks, even at interchange (transfer) stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamming&quot; /&gt;

Trains average {{convert|20|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}} with a maximum of {{convert|70|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on all but the automated driverless trains of [[Paris Métro Line 14|Line 14]], which average {{convert|40|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and reach {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. An average interstation trip takes 58 seconds.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Trains travel on the right. The track is [[standard gauge]] but the [[loading gauge]] is smaller than the mainline SNCF network. Power is from a lateral [[third rail]], 750 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]], except on the [[rubber-tyred metro|rubber-tyred]] lines where the current is from [[guide bar]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamming&quot; /&gt;

The [[loading gauge]] is small compared to those of newer metro systems (but comparable to that of early European metros), with capacities of between about 560 and 720 passengers per train on Lines 1–14. Many other metro systems (such as those of New York and London) adopted expanded tunnel dimensions for their newer lines (or used tunnels of multiple sizes almost from the outset, in the case of Boston), at the cost of operating incompatible fleets of rolling stock. Paris built all lines to the same dimensions as its original lines. Before the introduction of rubber-tire lines in the 1950s, this common shared size theoretically allowed any Métro rolling stock to operate on any line, but in practice each line was assigned a regular roster of trains.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

A feature is the use of rubber-tired trains on five lines: this technique was developed by RATP and entered service in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p312&lt;/ref&gt; The technology was exported to many networks around the world (including [[Montreal Metro|Montreal]], [[Mexico City Metro|Mexico City]] and [[Santiago Metro|Santiago]]). Lines 1, 4, 6, 11 and 14 have special adaptations to accommodate rubber-tyred trains. Trains are composed of 3 to 6 cars depending on the line, the most common being 5 cars (Line 14 may have 8 cars in the future), but all trains on the same line have the same number of cars.

The Metro is designed to provide local, point-to-point service in Paris proper and service into the city from some close suburbs. Stations within Paris are very close together to form a grid structure, ensuring that every point in the city is close to a metro station (less than {{convert|500|m|ft|disp=or}}), but this makes the service slow {{convert|20|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, except on Line 14 where the stations are farther apart and the trains travel faster. The low speed virtually precludes feasible service to farther suburbs, which are serviced by the RER.

The Paris Métro runs mostly underground; surface sections include sections on viaduct in Paris (Lines 1, 2, 5 and 6) and at the surface in the suburbs (Lines 1, 5, 8 and 13). In most cases both tracks are laid in a single tunnel. Almost all lines follow roads, having been built by the [[cut-and-cover]] method near the surface (the earliest by hand). [[Paris Métro Line 1|Line 1]] follows the straight course of the [[Champs-Elysées]] and on other lines some stations ([[Liège (Paris Métro)|Liège]], [[Commerce (Paris Métro)|Commerce]]) have platforms that do not align: the street above is too narrow to fit both platforms opposite each other. Many lines have very sharp curves. The specifications established in 1900 required a very low minimum curve radius by railway standards, but even this was often not fully respected, for example near Bastille and Notre Dame de Lorette. Parts of the network are built at depth, in particular a section of [[Paris Métro Line 12|Line 12]] under [[Montmartre]], the sections under the [[Seine]], and all of [[Paris Métro Line 14|Line 14]].

Lines 7 and 13 have two terminal branches.

== Rolling stock ==

[[File:Paris Metro 2 Porte Dauphine Libellule.JPG|thumb|[[Hector Guimard]]'s original [[Art Nouveau]] entrance of the Paris Métro at [[Porte Dauphine (Paris Métro)|Porte Dauphine station]]]]

The typical station comprises two central tracks flanked by two four-metre wide platforms. About 50 stations, generally current or former termini, are exceptions; most have three tracks and two platforms ([[Porte d'Orléans (Paris Métro)|Porte d'Orléans]]), or two tracks and a central platform ([[Porte Dauphine (Paris Métro)|Porte Dauphine]]). Some stations are single-track, either due to difficult terrain ([[Saint-Georges (Paris Métro)|Saint-Georges]]), a narrow street above ([[Liège (Paris Métro)|Liège]]) or track loops ([[Église d'Auteuil (Paris Métro)|Église d'Auteuil]]).

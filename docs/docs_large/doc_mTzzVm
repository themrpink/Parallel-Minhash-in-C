This apparent retrogradation puzzled ancient astronomers, and was one reason they named these bodies 'planets' in the first place: 'Planet' comes from the Greek word for 'wanderer'. In the [[geocentric universe|geocentric model]] of the Solar System proposed by [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] in the third century BCE, retrograde motion was explained by having the planets travel in [[deferent and epicycle|deferents and epicycles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrol 2007. pp. 4&quot; /&gt; It was not understood to be an illusion until the time of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], although the Greek astronomer [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] in 240 BCE proposed a [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] for the Solar System.

[[Galileo]]'s drawings show that he first observed [[Neptune]] on December 28, 1612, and again on January 27, 1613. On both occasions, Galileo mistook Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared very close—in conjunction—to [[Jupiter]] in the night sky, hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. During the period of his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that very day. Since Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small [[telescope]].

=== From Mercury ===

From any point on the daytime surface of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] when the planet is near [[perihelion]] (closest approach to the [[Sun]]), the Sun undergoes apparent retrograde motion. This occurs because, from approximately four Earth days before [[perihelion]] until approximately four Earth days after it, Mercury's angular [[orbital speed]] exceeds its angular [[rotational velocity]].&lt;ref&gt;Strom, Robert G.; Sprague, Ann L. (2003). ''Exploring Mercury: the iron planet''. Springer. {{ISBN|1-85233-731-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury's elliptical orbit is farther from circular than that of any other planet in the Solar System, resulting in a substantially higher orbital speed near perihelion. As a result, at specific points on Mercury's surface an observer would be able to see the Sun rise part way, then reverse and set before rising again, all within the same [[Extraterrestrial skies#Mercury|Mercurian day]].

{{wiktionary|zenith}}
The '''zenith''' is an imaginary point directly &quot;above&quot; a particular location, on the imaginary [[celestial sphere]]. &quot;Above&quot; means in the [[vertical direction]] ([[plumb line]]) opposite to the [[gravity direction]] at that location ([[nadir]]). The zenith is the &quot;highest&quot; point on the celestial sphere.

==Origin==
The word &quot;zenith&quot; derives from an inaccurate reading of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] expression {{lang|ar|سمت الرأس}} ({{transl|ar|DIN|samt al-ras}}), meaning &quot;direction of the head&quot; or &quot;path above the head&quot;, by [[Medieval Latin]] scribes in the [[Middle Ages]] (during the 14th century), possibly through [[Old Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Corominas |first=J. |title=Breve diccionario etimológico de la lengua castellana |lang=es |date=1987 |location=Madrid |isbn=978-8-42492-364-8 |edition=3rd |pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reduced to &quot;samt&quot; (&quot;direction&quot;) and miswritten as &quot;senit&quot;/&quot;cenit&quot;, the &quot;m&quot; being misread as &quot;ni&quot;. Through the [[Old French]] &quot;cenith&quot;, &quot;zenith&quot; first appeared in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Zenith |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zenith |dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance and use==

[[File:Tropical-area-mactan-philippines.jpg|thumb|right|The shadows of trees are the shortest on Earth when the Sun is directly overhead (at the zenith). This happens only at [[solar noon]] on certain days in the [[tropics]], where the trees' [[latitude]] and the Sun's [[declination]] are equal.]]
{{see also|Culmination}}

The term ''zenith'' sometimes means the [[culmination|highest point]], way, or level reached by a [[celestial body]] on its daily apparent path around a given point of observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Zenith|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zenith|dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of the word is often used to describe the [[position of the Sun]] (&quot;The sun reached its zenith...&quot;), but to an astronomer, the [[Sun]] does not have its own zenith and is at the zenith only if it is directly overhead.

In a scientific context, the zenith is the direction of reference for measuring the '''zenith angle''', the angle between a direction of interest (e.g. a star) and the local zenith - that is, the complement of the altitude.

The Sun reaches the observer's zenith when it is 90° above the horizon, and this only happens between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. In [[Islamic astronomy]], the passing of the Sun over the zenith of [[Mecca]] becomes the basis of the [[qibla observation by shadows]] twice a year on 27/28 May and 15/16 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|last=van Gent|first=Robert Harry|title=Determining the Sacred Direction of Islam|url=https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/qibla.htm|year=2017|website=Webpages on the History of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|ref=harv|last=Khalid |first=Tuqa| url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/26/middleeast/sun-kabaa-alignment/index.html |title=Sun will align directly over Kaaba, Islam's holiest shrine, on Friday | work =CNN | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a given location during the course of a day, the Sun reaches not only its zenith but also its [[nadir]], at the [[antipodal point|antipode]] of that location 12 hours from [[solar noon]].

In [[astronomy]], the altitude in the [[horizontal coordinate system]] and the zenith angle are [[complementary angles]], with the horizon perpendicular to the zenith. The astronomical [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] is also determined by the zenith, and is defined as a circle on the [[celestial sphere]] that passes through the zenith, [[nadir]], and the [[celestial pole]]s.

A [[zenith telescope]] is a type of telescope designed to point straight up at or near the zenith, and used for precision measurement of star positions, to simplify telescope construction, or both. The [[NASA Orbital Debris Observatory]] and the [[Large Zenith Telescope]] are both zenith telescopes since the use of [[liquid-mirror telescope|liquid mirrors]] meant these telescopes could only point straight up.

On the [[International Space Station]], ''zenith'' and ''nadir'' are used instead of ''up'' and ''down'', referring to directions within and around the station, relative to the earth.

[[File:Sureal Horizon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[High Desert (California)|High desert]] horizon at [[sunset]], [[California]], USA]]

The '''horizon''' or '''skyline''' is the apparent line that separates [[earth]] from [[sky]], the line that divides all visible directions into two categories: those that intersect the Earth's surface, and those that do not.
The ''true horizon'' is actually a theoretical line, which can only be observed when it lies on the sea surface. At many locations, this line is obscured by land, trees, buildings, mountains, etc., and the resulting intersection of earth and sky is called the ''visible horizon''. When looking at a sea from a shore, the part of the sea closest to the horizon is called the '''offing'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebstersThird&quot;&gt;
{{cite news|title=Offing|work=Webster's Third New International Dictionary|edition= Unabridged}} Pronounced, &quot;Hor-I-zon&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The true horizon is horizontal. It surrounds the observer and it is typically assumed to be a circle, drawn on the surface of a perfectly spherical model of the [[Earth]]. Its center is below the observer and below [[sea level]]. Its distance from the observer varies from day to day due to [[#Effect of atmospheric refraction|atmospheric refraction]], which is greatly affected by [[weather]] conditions. Also, the higher the observer's eyes are from sea level, the farther away the horizon is from the observer. For instance, in [[Reference atmospheric model|standard atmospheric conditions]], for an observer with eye level above sea level by {{Convert|1.70|m}}, the horizon is at a distance of about {{Convert|5|km}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATYoungDistToHoriz&quot;/&gt;

When observed from very high standpoints, such as a [[space station]], the horizon is much farther away and it encompasses a much larger area of Earth's surface. In this case, it becomes evident that the horizon more closely resembles an ellipse than a perfect circle, especially when the observer is above the equator, and that the Earth's surface can be better modeled as an [[Reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] than as a sphere.

== Etymology ==
The word ''horizon'' derives from the Greek {{lang|grc|&quot;ὁρίζων κύκλος&quot;}} ''horizōn kyklos'', &quot;separating circle&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%28ri%2Fzwn |title=ὁρίζων |authors=Liddell, Henry George &amp; Scott, Robert |work=[[A Greek-English Lexicon]] |publisher=[[Perseus Digital Library]] |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605181946/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=o(ri%2Fzwn |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where &quot;ὁρίζων&quot; is from the verb [[:wikt:ὁρίζω|ὁρίζω]] ''horizō'', &quot;to divide&quot;, &quot;to separate&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%28ri%2Fzw |title=ὁρίζω |authors=Liddell, Henry George &amp; Scott, Robert |work=[[A Greek-English Lexicon]] |publisher=[[Perseus Digital Library]] |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605182022/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=o(ri%2Fzw |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn derives from &quot;ὅρος&quot; (''oros''), &quot;boundary, landmark&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%28%2Fros |title=ὅρος |authors=Liddell, Henry George &amp; Scott, Robert |work=[[A Greek-English Lexicon]] |publisher=[[Perseus Digital Library]] |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605182059/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=o(%2Fros |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sailing_Boat_Horizon.JPG|thumb|View of the ocean with a ship on the horizon (small dot to left of foreground ship)]]
Historically, the distance to the visible horizon has long been vital to survival and successful navigation, especially at sea, because it determined an observer's maximum range of vision and thus of [[communication]], with all the obvious consequences for safety and the transmission of information that this range implied.  This importance lessened with the development of the [[radio]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], but even today, when flying an [[aircraft]] under [[visual flight rules]], a technique called [[attitude flying]] is used to control the aircraft, where the pilot uses the visual relationship between the aircraft's nose and the horizon to control the aircraft. Pilots can also retain their [[Spatial disorientation|spatial orientation]] by referring to the horizon.

In many contexts, especially [[Perspective projection|perspective]] drawing, the curvature of the [[Earth]] is disregarded and the horizon is considered the theoretical line to which points on any [[horizontal plane]] converge (when projected onto the picture plane) as their distance from the observer increases. For observers near [[sea level]] the difference between this ''geometrical horizon'' (which assumes a perfectly flat, infinite ground plane) and the ''true horizon'' (which assumes a [[spherical Earth]] surface) is imperceptible to the unaided eye{{dubious| reason = in the former case objects would be visible at any distance, which is very obviously not the true on the spherical earth|date=December 2011}} (but for someone on a 1000-meter hill looking out to sea the true horizon will be about a degree below a horizontal line).

In astronomy, the horizon is the horizontal plane through the eyes of the observer. It is the [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]] of the [[horizontal coordinate system]], the locus of points that have an [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] of zero degrees. While similar in ways to the geometrical horizon, in this context a horizon may be considered to be a plane in space, rather than a line on a picture plane.

== Distance to the horizon {{anchor|Distance}}==

Ignoring the [[#Effect of atmospheric refraction|effect of atmospheric refraction]], distance to the true horizon from an observer close to the Earth's surface is about&lt;ref name=&quot;ATYoungDistToHoriz&quot;&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/explain/atmos_refr/horizon.html |title=Distance to the Horizon |work=Green Flash website (Sections: Astronomical Refraction, Horizon Grouping) |author=Young, Andrew T. |publisher=San Diego State University Department of Astronomy |accessdate=April 16, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031018020513/http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/explain/atmos_refr/horizon.html |archivedate=October 18, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d \approx \sqrt{2\,h\,R} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is height above [[sea level]] and ''R'' is the [[Earth radius]].

When ''d'' is measured in kilometres and ''h'' in metres, the distance is

:&lt;math&gt;d \approx 3.57\sqrt{h} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant 3.57 has units of km/m&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt;.

When ''d'' is measured in miles (statute miles i.e. &quot;land miles&quot; of {{Convert|5280|ft|m|3}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ATYoungDistToHoriz&quot; /&gt;) and ''h'' in feet, the distance is

:&lt;math&gt;d \approx \sqrt{1.5h} \approx 1.22\sqrt{h} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant 1.22 has units of mi/ft&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt;.

In this equation [[Earth's surface]] is assumed to be perfectly spherical, with ''r'' equal to about {{Convert|6371|km}}.

===Examples===
Assuming no [[#Effect of atmospheric refraction|atmospheric refraction]] and a spherical Earth with radius R={{Convert|6371|km}}:
* For an observer standing on the ground with ''h'' = {{Convert|1.70|m}}, the horizon is at a distance of {{Convert|4.7|km}}.
* For an observer standing on the ground with ''h'' = {{Convert|2|m}}, the horizon is at a distance of {{Convert|5|km}}.
* For an observer standing on a hill or tower {{Convert|30|m}} above sea level, the horizon is at a distance of {{Convert|19.6|km}}.
* For an observer standing on a hill or tower {{Convert|100|m}} above sea level, the horizon is at a distance of {{Convert|36|km}}.
* For an observer standing on the roof of the [[Burj Khalifa]], {{Convert|828|m}} from ground, and about {{Convert|834|m}} above sea level, the horizon is at a distance of {{Convert|103|km}}.
* For an observer atop [[Mount Everest]] ({{Convert|8848|m}} in altitude), the horizon is at a distance of {{Convert|336|km}}.
* For a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] pilot, whilst flying at its service ceiling {{Convert|21000|m}}, the horizon is at a distance of {{Convert|521|km}}.

=== Other planets ===
On terrestrial planets and other solid celestial bodies with negligible atmospheric effects, the distance to the horizon for a &quot;standard observer&quot; varies as the square root of the planet's radius. Thus, the horizon on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is 62% as far away from the observer as it is on Earth, on [[Mars]] the figure is 73%, on the [[Moon]] the figure is 52%, on [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] the figure is 18%, and so on.

=== Derivation ===
[[File:CircleChordTangent.png|thumb|right|300px|Geometrical basis for calculating the distance to the horizon, secant tangent theorem]]
[[File:GeometricDistanceToHorizon.png|thumb|right|300px|Geometrical distance to the horizon, Pythagorean theorem]]
[[File:Horizons.svg|thumb|right|300px|Three types of horizon]]

If the Earth is assumed to be a featureless sphere (rather than an [[Earth ellipsoid|oblate spheroid]]) with no atmospheric refraction, then the distance to the horizon can easily be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/15/how-far-away-is-the-horizon/#.WNp_MGczVEY |title=How far away is the horizon? |last=Plait |first=Phil |date=15 January 2009 |website=Discover |series=Bad Astronomy |publisher=Kalmbach Publishing Co. |access-date=2017-03-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329050848/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/15/how-far-away-is-the-horizon/#.WNp_MGczVEY |archivedate=29 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Secant-secant theorem|secant-tangent theorem]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{OC}^2 = \mathrm{OA} \times \mathrm{OB} \,.&lt;/math&gt;
Make the following substitutions:
* ''d'' = OC = distance to the horizon
* ''D'' = AB = diameter of the Earth
* ''h'' = OB = height of the observer above sea level
* ''D+h'' = OA = diameter of the Earth plus height of the observer above sea level,

with ''d, D,'' and ''h'' all measured in the same units. The formula now becomes
:&lt;math&gt;d^2 = h(D+h)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{h(D+h)} =\sqrt{h(2R+h)}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

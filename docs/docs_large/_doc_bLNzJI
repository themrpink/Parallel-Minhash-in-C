===Conflict with Nikephoros===
Emperor Nikephoros soon requested that his new patriarch rehabilitate the priest Joseph, who had officiated at the wedding of Constantine and Theodote, possibly because Joseph had aided in the peaceful resolution of the revolt of [[Bardanes Tourkos]]. In 806, the Patriarch Nikephoros convened a [[synod]] to address the case, at which Theodore was present. The Synod decided to readmit Joseph to the priesthood, a decision to which Theodore did not at the time object.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=147–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, relations between the Studite Abbot and the Patriarch appear to have been initially untroubled, an impression which is reinforced by the choice (806/807) of Theodore's brother, Joseph, as Archbishop of Thesaloniki.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=151–153}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, soon after this ordination, perhaps in 808, Theodore began to express his unwillingness to associate with the rehabilitated priest Joseph, or for that matter with anyone else who knowingly associated with him, as he held the rehabilitation to be uncanonical. As in the first dispute over the priest Joseph, the extension of this refusal beyond Joseph to those who associated with him included implicitly the patriarch and the emperor himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=153–157}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 808, Theodoros offered in a series of letters to explain his position to the emperor, and furthermore to perform the customary [[proskynesis]] at his feet, which offer Nikephoros declined, instead setting off for the summer military campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=159–161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of the same year, Theodore's brother Joseph visited him in Constantinople, but refused to attend the Christmas mass in Hagia Sophia, at which the emperor, the patriarch, and the priest Joseph would have been present. As a result, he was stripped of his archbishopric.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=162–163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time a small military division was dispatched to the Stoudios Monastery to arrest Theodore, Joseph, and Platon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A synod was then held in January of 809, at which Theodore and his followers were anathematized as schismatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=170–171}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore, Joseph, and Platon were thereafter banished to the [[Princes' Islands]]: Theodore to [[Heybeliada|Chalke]], Joseph to [[Kınalıada|Prote]], and Platon to [[Sivriada|Oxeia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodore maintained an extensive literary activity in exile, writing numerous letters to correspondents including his brother, various Studite monks, influential family members, and even [[Pope Leo III]]. He also continued to compose catechisms for the Studite congregation, as well as a number of poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=175–176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rehabilitation under Michael I===
In 811, the new emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] called the Studites back from exile. The priest Joseph was once more defrocked, and Theodore was, at least superficially, reconciled with the Patriarch Nikephoros.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, indications that a certain rivalry between the Studite Abbot and the Patriarch persisted. In 812, Michael I resolved to persecute certain heretics in [[Phrygia]] and [[Lycaonia]], namely the [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]] and the &quot;Athinganoi&quot; (sometimes identified with the [[Romani people|Roma]]). Theodore and Nikephoros were called before the emperor to debate the legality of punishing heresy by death, Theodore arguing against and Nikephoros for. Theodore is said to have won the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=189–191}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second affair concerned a peace treaty proposed by [[Krum of Bulgaria]] (r. 803–814), also in 812, according to which the Byzantine and Bulgarian states should exchange refugees. It is likely that Krum sought the return of certain Bulgarians who had betrayed him to the Byzantines. In this instance Theodore argued against the exchange, as it would require that Christians be cast to barbarians, while Nikephoros urged the emperor to accept the treaty. Once more Theodore's opinion prevailed, although this time with serious consequences; Krum attacked and took [[Nesebar|Mesembria]] in November the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=192–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael led a military campaign against the Bulgarians in 813, which ended in defeat, and as a result he abdicated in July and [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] was crowned emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=196–199}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 814 Theodore's uncle Platon died in the Stoudios Monastery after a long illness. Theodore composed a long funeral oration, the ''Laudatio Platonis'', which remains one of the most important sources for the history of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=201}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Iconoclasm===
[[File:Hosios Loukas (nave, arch by north west bay) - Theodore Studites.jpg|thumbnail|Mosaic of Theodore the Studite located in [[Hosios Loukas]].]]
At the very beginning of his reign, the emperor Leo V faced a new Bulgarian offensive that reached the walls of Constantinople and ravaged large sections of [[Thrace]]. This came to an end with the death of Krum on April 13, 814, and the internal power struggles that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=203–204 (with note 8)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the previous 30 years since the approval of icon-veneration at the Synod of 787 had represented for the Byzantines a string of military catastrophes, Leo resolved to reach back to the policies of the more successful Isaurian dynasty. He renamed his son Constantine, thus drawing a parallel to [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] (r. 717–741) and [[Constantine V]], and beginning in 814 began to discuss with various clerics and senators the possibility of reviving the iconoclastic policy of the Isaurians. This movement met with strong opposition from the Patriarch Nikephoros, who himself gathered a group of bishops and abbots about him and swore them to uphold the veneration of images. The dispute came to a head in a debate between the two parties before the emperor in the Great Palace on Christmas 814, at which Theodore and his brother Joseph were present and took the side of the iconophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=204–223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo held fast by his plan to revive iconoclasm, and in March 815 the Patrarch Nikephoros was stripped of his office and exiled to Bithynia. At this point Theodore remained in Constantinople, and assumed a leading role in the iconodule opposition. On March 25, Palm Sunday, he commanded his monks to process through the monastery's vineyard, holding up icons so that they could be seen over the walls by the neighbors. This provocation elicited only a rebuke from the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=229–230}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new patriarch, [[Ecumenical Patriarch Theodotos I of Constantinople|Theodotos]], was selected, and in April a synod was convened in Hagia Sophia, at which iconoclasm was re-introduced as dogma. Theodore composed a series of letters in which he called on &quot;all, near and far,&quot; to revolt against the decision of the synod. Not long thereafter he was exiled by imperial command to a Metopa, a fortress on the eastern shore of [[Lake Uluabat|Lake Apollonia]] in Bithynia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=231–234 and 247}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter Leo had Theodore's poems removed from the Chalke Gate and replaced by a new set of &quot;iconoclastic&quot; epigrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Theodore was in exile, the leadership of the Studite congregation was assumed by the Abbot Leontios, who for a time adopted the iconoclast position and won over many individual monks to his party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=242–243}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, eventually won back to the iconodule party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=245–246}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Studite situation mirrored a general trend, with a number of bishops and abbots at first willing to reach a compromise with the iconoclasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=235–245}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but then in the years between 816 and 819 renouncing the iconoclast position, a movement that was perhaps motivated by the martyrdom of the Studite monk Thaddaios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=245–246 and 252}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this upswell in icondule sentiment that Theodore began to compose his own polemic against the iconoclasts, the ''Refutatio'', concentrating in particular on refuting the arguments and criticizing the literary merits of the new iconoclastic epigrams on the Chalke.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=246–247}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodore exercised a wide influence during the first year of his exile, primarily through a massive letter-writing campaign. Accordingly, he was transferred in 816 to Boneta, a fortress in the more remote [[Anatolic theme]], whence he nevertheless remained abreast of developments in the capital and maintained a regular correspondence. This continued activity led to an imperial order that Theodore be whipped, which his captors however refused to carry out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=247–251}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 817, Theodore wrote two letters to [[Pope Paschal I]], which were co-signed by several fellow iconophile abbots, in the first requesting that he summon an anti-iconoclastic Synod; letters to the Patriarchs of [[Patriarch Christopher I of Alexandria|Alexandria]] and [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], among other &quot;foreign&quot; clerics, followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=253–254}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the emperor ordered at least once more that Theodore be flogged, and the command was this time carried out, with the result that Theodore became quite ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=255–258}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After his recovery Theodore was moved to [[Smyrna]]. Early in 821, however, Leo V fell victim to a grisly murder at the altar of the Church of St. Stephen in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|imperial palace]]; Theodore was released from exile shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=259–261 and 263}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
Following his release, Theodore made his way back to Constantinople, travelling through north-western Anatolia and meeting with numerous monks and abbots on the way. At the time he appears to have believed that the new emperor, [[Michael II]] (r. 820–829), would adopt a pro-icons policy, and he expressed this hope in two letters to Michael.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=263–267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An imperial audience was arranged for a group of iconodule clerics, including Theodore, at which however Michael expressed his intention to &quot;leave the church as he had found it.&quot; The abbots were to be allowed to venerate images if they so wished, as long as they remained outside of Constantinople. Theodore returned to Anatolia, in what seems to have been a sort of self-imposed exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=268–271}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodore's activities in his final years are somewhat difficult to trace. He continued to write numerous letters supporting the use of icons, and appears to have remained an important leader of the opposition to imperial iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was present at a meeting of &quot;more than a hundred&quot; iconodule clerics in 823 or 824, which ended in an argument between the Studites and the host, one Ioannikos, which may have represented a power struggle within the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=281–288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore also spoke against the second marriage of Michael II to the nun Euphrosyne, a daughter of Constantine VI, although in a very moderate fashion, and with none of the passion or effect of the Moechian controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=278–281}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodore's years of exile, regular fasting, and exceptional exertions had taken their toll, and in 826 he became quite ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this year, he dictated his ''Testament'', a form of spiritual guidance for the future abbots of the Stoudios monastery, to his disciple Naukratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|Hero|Constable|2000|loc=I.68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 11 November that year, while celebrating mass, apparently in the monastery of Hagios Tryphon on Cape Akritas in Bithynia. Eighteen years later, his remains, along with those of his brother Joseph, were brought back to the Stoudios Monastery, where they were interred beside the grave of their uncle Platon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=288–291}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Theodore's revival of the Stoudios monastery had a major effect on the later history of [[Eastern Christian Monasticism|Byzantine monasticism]]. His disciple, Naukratios, recovered control of the monastery after the end of iconoclasm in 842, and throughout the remainder of the ninth century the Studite abbots continued Theodore's tradition of opposition to patriarchal and imperial authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|Hero|Constable|2000|pp=68–69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of Theodore's ''Testament'' were incorporated verbatim in the [[Typikon|typika]] of certain early [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|Hero|Constable|2000|loc=I.72 and I.84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important elements of his reform were its emphases on [[cenobitic]] (communal) life, manual labor, and a carefully defined administrative hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|Hero|Constable|2000|loc=I.85-87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodore also built the Stoudios monastery into a major scholarly center, in particular through its library and scriptorium, which certainly surpassed all other contemporary Byzantine ecclesiastical institutions in this regard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pratsch, Theodoros, 306&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|p=306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore himself was a pivotal figure in the revival of classical literary forms, in particular iambic verse, in Byzantium, and his criticisms of the iconoclastic epigrams drew a connection between literary skill and orthodox faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Speck|1984|pp=194 (with note 18), 203}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death the Stoudios monastery continued to be a vital center for Byzantine hymnography and hagiography, as well as for the copying of manuscripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pratsch, Theodoros, 306&quot;/&gt;

Following the &quot;triumph of Orthodoxy&quot; (i.e. the reintroduction of icons) in 843, Theodore became one of the great heroes of the iconodule opposition. There was no formal process of [[canonization]] in Byzantium, but Theodore was soon recognized as a saint. In the Latin West, a tradition arose according to which Theodore had recognized [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|papal primacy]], on the basis of his letters to Pope [[Paschal I]], and he was formally canonized by the Catholic Church. His [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] is 11 November in the [[Eastern Christianity|East]] and 12 November in the [[Western Christianity|West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratsch|1998|pp=311–313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary on Theodore==
As also mentioned by [[Kirby Page]] in ''Jesus or Christianity'', [[Charles Loring Brace]] tells us in ''Gesta Christi'' that it was not until the 9th century that the first recorded stand against slavery itself was taken by Theodore:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brace|1888|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No direct word against slavery, however, came forth from the great Teacher [Jesus Christ]. It was not until the ninth century after, that one of his humble followers, Saint Theodore of Studium (Constantinople), ventured to put forth the command &quot;Thou shalt possess no slave, neither for domestic service nor for the labor of the fields, for man is made in the image of God.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''fractal transform''' is a technique invented by [[Michael Barnsley]] ''et al.'' to perform [[lossy data compression|lossy]] [[image compression]].
This first practical [[fractal compression]] system for digital images resembles a [[vector quantization]] system using the image itself as the codebook.

== Fractal transform compression ==

Start with a digital [[image]] A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
Downsample it by a factor of 2 to produce image A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Now, for each block B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of 4x4 pixels in A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, find the corresponding block B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; most similar to B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and then find the [[grayscale]] or [[RGB color space|RGB]] offset and gain from A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
For each destination block, output the positions of the source blocks and the color offsets and gains.

== Fractal transform decompression ==
Starting with an empty destination image A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, repeat the following algorithm several times:
Downsample A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; down by a factor of 2 to produce image A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then copy blocks from A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as directed by the compressed data, multiplying by the respective gains and adding the respective color offsets.

This algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an image, and it should appear similar to the original image.
In fact, a slight modification of the decompressor to run at block sizes larger than 4x4 pixels produces a method of stretching images without causing the blockiness or blurriness of traditional [[linear]] [[Resampling (bitmap)|resampling]] [[algorithm]]s.

== Patents ==
The basic patents covering Fractal Image Compression, U.S. Patents 4,941,193, 5,065,447, 5,384,867, 5,416,856, and 5,430,812 appear to be expired.

[[Image:Snells law2.svg|thumb|[[Refraction]] of light at the interface between two media of different [[refractive index|refractive indices]], with n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the velocity is lower in the second medium (v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), the angle of refraction θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is less than the angle of incidence θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; that is, the ray in the higher-index medium is closer to the normal.]]

'''Snell's law''' (also known as '''Snell–Descartes law'''  and the '''law of refraction''') is a [[mathematical formula|formula]] used to describe the relationship between the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incidence]] and [[refraction]], when referring to light or other [[wave]]s passing through a boundary between two different [[isotropic]] [[medium (optics)|media]], such as water, glass, or air.

In optics, the law is used in [[Ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]] to compute the angles of incidence or refraction, and in experimental optics to find the [[refractive index]] of a material. The law is also satisfied in [[Metamaterials#Negative refractive index|metamaterials]], which allow light to be bent &quot;backward&quot; at a negative angle of refraction with a [[Refractive index#Negative refractive index|negative refractive index]].

Snell's law states that the ratio of the [[sine]]s of the angles of incidence and refraction is equivalent to the ratio of [[Phase velocity|phase velocities]] in the two media, or equivalent to the reciprocal of the ratio of the [[Refractive index|indices of refraction]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin\theta_2}{\sin\theta_1} = \frac{v_2}{v_1} = \frac{n_1}{n_2}&lt;/math&gt;

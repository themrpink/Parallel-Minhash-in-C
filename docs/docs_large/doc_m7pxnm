All three main games in the ''Myth'' series received positive reviews, especially ''The Fallen Lords'' and ''Soulblighter'', which were universally acclaimed. Although ''The Wolf Age'' was generally well reviewed, it was seen as considerably inferior to the two previous games.

[[GameSpot]]'s Michael E. Ryan wrote of ''The Fallen Lords'' that it &quot;can claim its place among the best strategy games on the market&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the most impressive games you'll see this year&quot;, and &quot;a truly remarkable real-time strategy game&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSpotFL&quot;/&gt; [[Game Revolution]]'s Calvin Hubble called it &quot;one of the most impressive looking strategy games to hit the market&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevolutionFL&quot;/&gt;

Ryan called ''Soulblighter'' &quot;as good as a computer game can possibly be&quot; and &quot;one of the best games to be released this year&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSpotSB&quot;/&gt; Hubble called it &quot;both one of the best sequels to hit the scene and one of the finest titles on the RTS market&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevolutionSB&quot;/&gt; [[IGN]]'s Tal Blevins said the game &quot;lives up to (and surpasses) all of the hype surrounding [it]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNSB&quot;/&gt;

IGN's Dan Adams wrote of ''The Wolf Age'', &quot;Fans of the series shouldn't be disappointed by MumboJumbo's effort to follow in the mighty footsteps that Bungie left behind.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNWA&quot;/&gt; GameSpot's Sam Parker wrote, &quot;[…] ''Myth III''{{'}}s single-player game represents the best the ''Myth'' series has to offer.&quot; However, he was critical of the absence of many promised multiplayer features, the absence of the Vengeance mapmaking tool, and compatibility issues with [[Windows XP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GSpotWA&quot;/&gt; [[GameSpy]]'s William Abner wrote, &quot;[…] ''The Wolf Age'' isn't a complete product. It's close. And parts of it are just as fun, if not more so, than the earlier games, but a laundry list of bugs, hardware glitches, and severe multiplayer issues keep the game from reaching its potential.&quot; He too was critical of the absence of Vengeance and of multiplayer mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/november01/myth3/ | title=Myth III: The Wolf Age Review | last=Abner | first=William | publisher=[[GameSpy]] | date=November 1, 2001 | accessdate=May 8, 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718034758/http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/november01/myth3/ | archivedate=July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales and awards===
According to Alex Seropian, co-founder of Bungie, ''The Fallen Lords'' cost roughly $2 million to produce and market, by far Bungie's most expensive game up to that time, and as such, they needed it to be financially successful, especially as it was their first original PC game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Myth: The Fallen Lords: Strategies &amp; Secrets | last=Farkas | first=Bart | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Sybex]] | location=New York, NY | year=1997 | page=270 | isbn=9780782121407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game did prove to be a commercial success, selling over 350,000 units worldwide at roughly $40 per unit, earning the company $14 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; and becoming Bungie's most successful game thus far.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters&quot;/&gt; By 2000, the game had over 100,000 people registered with online accounts at Bungie for multiplayer games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters&quot;/&gt; The success of the game also helped Bungie rank #101 in ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]''{{'}}s 1998 list of the 500 fastest growing [[Privately held company|private corporations]] in North America. Primarily due to the success of ''The Fallen Lords'', Bungie's profits had increased by 2,228% from 1993 to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-part-of-the-inc-500/1100-2465315/ | title=Bungie Part of the Inc. 500 | website=[[GameSpot]] | date=October 27, 1998 | accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Fallen Lords'' also won numerous awards, including &quot;Real-Time Strategy Game of the Year&quot; from ''[[PC Gamer]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Gold&quot;/&gt; &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot; from ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/computer-gaming-world-announces-the-winners-of-the-1998-premier-awards-for-games-and-game-related-hardware-76328557.html | title=Computer Gaming World Announces the Winners of the 1998 Premier Awards For Games and Game-related Hardware | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=January 16, 1998 | accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Game of the Year&quot; from both ''[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]]'' and ''[[Macworld]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters&quot;/&gt; ''Online Game Review'' named it one of the fifty greatest games ever made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters&quot;/&gt;

''Soulblighter'' considerably outsold ''The Fallen Lords''. In North America, pre-orders for the game reached 140,000 units. When v1.1 was released on January 7, day one sales reached roughly the same number of units the original sold worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters&quot;/&gt;

'''''How Green Was My Valley''''' is a 1939 novel by [[Richard Llewellyn]], narrated by Huw Morgan, the main character, about his Welsh family and the [[Mining in Wales|mining]] community in which they live. The author had claimed that he based the book on his own personal experiences but this was found to be untrue after his death; Llewellyn was English-born and spent little time in Wales, though he was of Welsh descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wales Arts&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/richard-llewellyn/index.shtml | title=Richard Llewellyn| publisher=BBC Wales | date=28 November 2008 | accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Llewellyn gathered material for the novel from conversations with local mining families in [[Gilfach Goch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wales Arts&quot;/&gt;

The title of the novel appears in two sentences. It is first used in Chapter Thirty, after the narrator has had his first sexual experience. He sits up to &quot;...&amp;nbsp;look down in the valley.&quot; He then reflects: &quot;How green was my Valley that day, too, green and bright in the sun.&quot; The phrase is used again in the novel's last sentence: &quot;How green was my Valley then, and the Valley of them that have gone.&quot;

In the United States, Llewellyn won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]] for favourite novel of 1940, voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].&lt;ref name=nyt1941&gt;
&quot;Books and Authors&quot;, ''The New York Times'', 16 February 1941, page BR12. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

The novel is set in [[South Wales]] during the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. It tells the story of the Morgans, a respectable mining family of the [[South Wales Valleys]], through the eyes of one of the sons, Huw Morgan.

Huw's academic ability sets him apart from his elder brothers and enables him to consider a future away from the dangerous coal mines. His five brothers and his father are miners. After his eldest brother, Ivor, is killed in a [[mining accident]], Huw moves in with his sister-in-law, Bronwen, with whom he has always been in love.&lt;ref&gt;Due to this character, the female first name &quot;Bronwen&quot; - hitherto known only in Wales - was introduced to the English-speaking public at large (see Sheard, K. M. (2011), {{Google books|FVyHTUQnnBgC|Llewellyn’s Complete Book of Names|page=110}}, {{ISBN|9780738723686}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Huw's three sisters, Angharad, marries the wealthy mine owner's son – whom she does not love – and the marriage is an unhappy one. She never overcomes her clandestine relationship with the local minister.

Huw's father is later killed in a mine explosion. After everyone Huw has known either dies or moves away, and the town is reduced to a contaminated shell, he decides to leave, and tells the story of his life just before going away.

==Characters==
'''The Older Morgans:'''
*Gwilym Morgan, Huw's father: wants things done properly, with attention to manners, and a minding of one's own business
*Beth Morgan, Huw's mother: devoted to her children and husband, uneducated, struggles with her temper
*Bronwen, sister-in-law: A gentle character to whom Huw goes when he is troubled or wants to learn information that the adults hold from him.  She is the mother of Gareth.
*Ivor Morgan, Huw's eldest brother, marries Bronwen, sides with the father against the strike, defends Angharad against Iestyn Evans' initial familiarity.

'''The Middle Brothers:'''
These are Huw's young adult brothers.  Ianto goes to London to find work early in the book, but returns unhappily; Owen and Gwilym do the same later.

*Ianto Morgan, Huw's second oldest brother
*Davy Morgan, a leader in the union
*Owen Morgan, an inventor, often found in the shed behind the house working on an engine
*Gwilym Morgan (junior), with his wife, Marged

'''The Younger Morgans:''' 
*Angharad Morgan, Huw's sister, marries Iestyn Evans
*Ceridwen Morgan, Huw's sister, marries Blethyn
*Huw Morgan, the Narrator
*Olwen Morgan, Huw's youngest sister
*Gareth Morgan, Huw's nephew

'''Other Characters:'''
*Merddyn Gruffydd, the preacher who is loved by Angharad, helps Huw recover from his illness, and is supportive of the Morgans.
*Iestyn Evans, an arrogant dandy, son of the mine owner, who courts Angharad.  According to Young Gwilym, &quot;a purse-proud ninny&quot; (chapters 15, 22, 23, etc.)
*Master Jonas, an arrogant teacher who makes Huw's life miserable.  He is pro-English, and ashamed of his Welsh heritage (chapters 16, 18, 19, &amp; 21)

==Adaptations==
{{main article|How Green Was My Valley (film)}}

The 1941 Hollywood film adaptation, which was highly successful, had a cast that included [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Maureen O'Hara]], [[Anna Lee]], [[Roddy McDowall]] (as Huw), [[Donald Crisp]], and [[Barry Fitzgerald]]. None of the leading players was Welsh (though Welsh actor Rhys Williams made his screen debut in the film in a minor role). Directed by John Ford, ''How Green Was My Valley'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. ''How Green Was My Valley'' is available on DVD from [[20th Century Fox]] as part of their 20th Century Fox Studio Classics collection.

The book has twice been adapted by the [[BBC]] for television, in 1960 and 1975. The [[How Green Was My Valley (1960 TV series)|1960 adaptation]] featured [[Eynon Evans]], [[Rachel Thomas (actress)|Rachel Thomas]] and [[Glyn Houston]]. The [[How Green Was My Valley (mini-series)|1975 production]], scripted by [[Elaine Morgan]], starred [[Stanley Baker]], [[Siân Phillips]], and [[Nerys Hughes]].

The novel was adapted as a Broadway musical, called ''[[A Time for Singing]]'', which opened at the Broadway Theatre, New York, on 21 May 1966. The music was by John Morris; book and lyrics were by Gerald Freedman and John Morris. The production was directed by Mr. Freedman, and it starred Ivor Emmanuel, Tessie O'Shea, Shani Wallis, and Laurence Naismith.

A stage version, adapted by [[Shaun McKenna]] was performed at the [[Royal Theatre (Northampton)|Theatre Royal]] in [[Northampton]] in 1990.  It marked the stage debut of [[Aled Jones]] as the teenage Huw. It was directed by [[Michael Napier Brown]] and designed by Ray Lett.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shaunmckenna.net/#/how-green-was-my-valley/4559746578&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the book was also adapted as a short film for the use in the music video&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/564107696/alt-j-make-a-breathtaking-short-film-for-pleader|title=alt-J Make A Breathtaking Short Film For 'Pleader'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the song Pleader&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2017/11/15/alt-j-pleader-video-epic-share|title=Alt-J essentially make their own period drama for their 'Pleader' video|website=DIY|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the band [[alt-J]]. The music video adaptation takes some liberties in retelling the story, with the catastrophic family deaths being caused by a landslide, which was caused by a German V2 rocket during WWII rather than a mine explosion.

'''Shor's algorithm''' is a [[polynomial-time]] [[quantum algorithm|quantum computer algorithm]] for [[integer factorization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shor|first=P.W.|title=Algorithms for quantum computation: discrete logarithms and factoring|journal=Proceedings 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|pages=124–134|publisher=IEEE Comput. Soc. Press|doi=10.1109/sfcs.1994.365700|isbn=0818665807|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informally, it solves the following problem: Given an integer &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;, find its [[prime factor]]s. It was invented in 1994 by the American mathematician [[Peter Shor]].

On a quantum computer, to factor an integer &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;, Shor's algorithm runs in polynomial time (the time taken is polynomial in &lt;math&gt; \log N &lt;/math&gt;, the size of the integer given as input).&lt;ref&gt;See also [[pseudo-polynomial time]].&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it takes [[quantum logic gate|quantum gates]] of order &lt;math&gt; O \! \left((\log N)^{2} (\log \log N) (\log \log \log N) \right) &lt;/math&gt; using fast multiplication,&lt;ref name = &quot;Beckman&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Beckman|first1 = David|last2 = Chari|first2 = Amalavoyal N.|last3 = Devabhaktuni|first3 = Srikrishna|last4 = Preskill|first4 = John|title = Efficient Networks for Quantum Factoring|journal = Physical Review A|volume = 54|issue = 2|pages = 1034–1063|year = 1996|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.54.1034|pmid = 9913575|bibcode = 1996PhRvA..54.1034B|url = https://authors.library.caltech.edu/2179/1/BECpra96.pdf|arxiv = quant-ph/9602016}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus demonstrating that the integer-factorization problem can be efficiently solved on a quantum computer and is consequently in the [[complexity class]] '''[[BQP]]'''. This is almost exponentially faster than the most efficient known classical factoring algorithm, the [[general number field sieve]], which works in [[sub-exponential time]]: &lt;math&gt; O \! \left(e^{1.9 (\log N)^{1/3} (\log \log N)^{2/3}} \right) &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberFieldSieve.html|title = Number Field Sieve|work = wolfram.com|access-date = 23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of Shor's algorithm is due to the efficiency of the [[quantum Fourier transform]], and [[modular exponentiation]] by [[exponentiation by squaring|repeated squarings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gidney |first1=Craig |title=Shor's Quantum Factoring Algorithm |url=https://algassert.com/post/1718 |website=Algorithmic Assertions |access-date=28 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a quantum computer with a sufficient number of [[qubit]]s could operate without succumbing to [[quantum noise]] and other [[quantum decoherence|quantum-decoherence]] phenomena, then Shor's algorithm could be used to break [[public-key cryptography]] schemes, such as the widely used [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] scheme. RSA is based on the assumption that factoring large integers is computationally intractable. As far as is known, this assumption is valid for classical (non-quantum) computers; no classical algorithm is known that can factor integers in polynomial time. However, Shor's algorithm shows that factoring integers is efficient on an ideal quantum computer, so it may be feasible to defeat RSA by constructing a large quantum computer. It was also a powerful motivator for the design and construction of quantum computers, and for the study of new quantum-computer algorithms. It has also facilitated research on new cryptosystems that are secure from quantum computers, collectively called [[post-quantum cryptography]].

In 2001, Shor's algorithm was demonstrated by a group at [[IBM]], who factored &lt;math&gt; 15 &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt; 3 \times 5 &lt;/math&gt;, using an [[Nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer|NMR implementation]] of a quantum computer with &lt;math&gt; 7 &lt;/math&gt; qubits.&lt;ref name = &quot;VSBYSC01&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Vandersypen|first1 = Lieven M.

== Procedure ==
The problem that we are trying to solve is, given a [[composite number]] &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;, to find a non-trivial [[divisor]] of &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; (a divisor strictly between &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;). Before attempting to find such a divisor, one can use relatively quick [[primality testing|primality-testing]] algorithms to verify that &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is indeed composite.

We need &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; to be odd (otherwise &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt; is a divisor) and not to be any power of a prime (otherwise that prime is a divisor), so we need to check that there are no integer roots &lt;math&gt; \sqrt[k]{N} &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; 2 \leq k \leq {\log_{3}}(N) &lt;/math&gt;.

Hence we may assume that &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is the product of two [[coprime]] integers greater than &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt;. It follows from the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] that there are at least four distinct square roots of &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; (since there are two roots for each modular equation). The aim of the algorithm is to find a square root &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; that is different from &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; - 1 &lt;/math&gt;, because then 
:&lt;math&gt; b^2 - 1 = (b+1)(b-1) = mN &lt;/math&gt;
for a non-zero integer &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; that gives us the non-trivial divisors &lt;math&gt; \gcd(N, b+1) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \gcd(N, b-1) &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;.
This idea is similar to other [[integer factorization|factoring algorithms]], such as the [[quadratic sieve]].

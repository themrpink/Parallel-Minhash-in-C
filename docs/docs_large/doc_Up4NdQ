===Democratic peace theory===
Proponents of the [[democratic peace theory]] claim that strong empirical evidence exists that democracies never or rarely wage war against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |publisher=M Tholyoke |title=International relations |contribution=Ray |place=USA |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217032515/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |archive-date=17 February 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/smith/dempeace.PDF |publisher=New York University |place=USA |last=Smith |title=Politics |contribution=Democracy &amp; peace}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.academia.edu/2486355 |title=Dyadic Democratic Peace Strikes Back |accessdate=31 July 2013 |author=Müller, Harald and Jonas Wolff |book-title=5th Pan-European International Relations ConferenceThe Hague |date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |work=ForeignAffairs.org |date=1 November 2005 |title=Fareview essay |first=John M, IV |last=Owen |id=Iraq and the democratic peace |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221155722/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |archive-date=21 December 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, several [[List of wars between democracies|wars between democracies]] that have taken place, historically.

===Capitalism peace theory===
In her essay &quot;The Roots of War&quot;, [[Ayn Rand]] held that the major wars of history were started by the more controlled economies of the time against the freer ones and that capitalism gave mankind the longest period of peace in history—a period during which there were no wars involving the entire civilized world—from the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, with the exceptions of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870), the [[Spanish–American War]] (1898), and the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), which notably occurred in perhaps the most liberal economy in the world at the beginning of the industrial revolution.

===Cobdenism===
Proponents of [[Cobdenism]] claim that by removing tariffs and creating international [[free trade]] wars would become impossible because free trade prevents a nation from becoming [[self-sufficient]], which is a requirement for long wars.

However, free trade does not prevent a nation from establishing some sort of emergency plan to become temporarily self-sufficient in case of war or that a nation could simply acquire what it needs from a different nation. A good example of this is [[World War I]], during which both Britain and Germany became partially self-sufficient. This is particularly important because Germany had no plan for creating a [[war economy]].

More generally, free trade—while not making wars impossible—can make wars, and restrictions on trade caused by wars, very costly for international companies with production, research, and sales in many different nations. Thus, a powerful lobby—unless there are only national companies—will argue against wars.

===Mutual assured destruction===
[[Mutual assured destruction]] is a [[doctrine]] of military strategy in which a full-scale use of [[nuclear weapons]] by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both belligerents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/strategy-mutual-assured-destruction.htm | publisher = Nuclear files | title = Strategy | contribution = Mutual Assured Destruction}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Col. Alan J | last = Parrington | publisher = Air Force | place = USA | url = http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html | contribution = Mutually Assured Destruction Revisited, Strategic Doctrine in Question | title = Airpower Journal | date = Winter 1997 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150620055606/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html | archive-date = 20 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the policy of mutual assured destruction during the Cold War attributed this to the increase in the lethality of war to the point where it no longer offers the possibility of a net gain for either side, thereby making wars pointless.

===United Nations Charter and international law===
[[File:Pattern For Peace Catholic, Jewish and Protestant Declaration on World Peace (Page 1).tif|thumb|right|Interfaith declaration on world peace from the 1941–43 bulletin for the [[Commission to Study the Organization of Peace]]]] After World War II, the United Nations was established by the [[United Nations Charter]] to &quot;save successive generations from the scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind&quot; (Preamble). The [[Preamble to the United Nations Charter]] also aims to further the adoption of fundamental human rights, to respect obligations to [[sources of international law]] as well as to unite the strength of independent countries in order to maintain international peace and [[international security|security]]. All treaties on [[international human rights law]] make reference to or consider &quot;the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and &quot;peace in the world&quot;.

===Globalization===
[[Gordon B. Hinckley]] saw a trend in national politics by which [[city-states]] and [[nation-states]] have unified and suggests that the international arena will eventually follow suit. Many countries such as China, Italy, the United States, Australia, Germany, India, and Britain have unified into single nation-states with others like the [[European Union]] following suit, suggesting that further [[globalization]] will bring about a [[world state]].

===&lt;span lang=&quot;az-latn&quot;&gt;Self&lt;/span&gt;-organized peace===
World peace has been depicted as a consequence of local, self-determined behaviors that inhibit the institutionalization of power and ensuing violence.  The solution is not so much based on an agreed agenda, or an investment in higher authority whether divine or political, but rather a [[Self-organization|self-organized]] network of mutually supportive mechanisms, resulting in a viable politico-economic social fabric. The principal technique for inducing convergence is [[thought experiment]], namely [[backcasting]], enabling anyone to participate no matter what cultural background, religious doctrine, political affiliation, or age demographic. Similar collaborative mechanisms are emerging from the Internet around [[open-source model|open-source]] projects, including [[Wikipedia]], and the evolution of other [[social media]].

===Economic norms theory===
[[Michael Mousseau|Economic norms theory]] links economic conditions with institutions of governance and conflict, distinguishing personal [[clientelism|clientelist]] economies from impersonal market-oriented ones, identifying the latter with permanent peace within and between nations.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mousseau 2009&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | contribution = The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace | title = International Security | volume = 33 | number = 4 | date = Spring 2009 | pages = 52–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | author-mask = 8 | contribution = Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror | title = International Security | volume = 27 | number = 3 | date = Winter 2002–2003 | pages = 5–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of human history, societies have been based on personal relations: individuals in groups know each other and exchange favors. Today in most lower-income societies hierarchies of groups distribute wealth based on personal relationships among group leaders, a process often linked with clientelism and corruption. [[Michael Mousseau]] argues that in this kind of socio-economy conflict is always present, latent or overt, because individuals depend on their groups for physical and economic security and are thus loyal to their groups rather than their states, and because groups are in a constant state of conflict over access to state coffers. Through processes of [[bounded rationality]], people are conditioned towards strong in-group identities and are easily swayed to fear outsiders, psychological predispositions that make possible sectarian violence, genocide, and terrorism.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mousseau 2003&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael |last= Mousseau |author-mask = 8 | year = 2003 |title= The Nexus of Market Society, Liberal Preferences, and Democratic Peace: Interdisciplinary Theory and Evidence | journal= International Studies Quarterly | volume= 47 |number= 4 |pages= 483–510 | doi=10.1046/j.0020-8833.2003.00276.x|citeseerx= 10.1.1.321.7034 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Market-oriented socio-economics are integrated not with personal ties but the impersonal force of the market where most individuals are economically dependent on trusting strangers in contracts enforced by the state. This creates loyalty to a state that enforces the rule of law and contracts impartially and reliably and provides equal protection in the freedom to contract – that is, liberal democracy. Wars cannot happen within or between nations with market-integrated economies because war requires the harming of others, and in these kinds of economies, everyone is always economically better off when others in the market are also better off, not worse off. Rather than fight, citizens in market-oriented socio-economies care deeply about everyone's rights and welfare, so they demand economic growth at home and economic cooperation and human rights abroad. In fact, nations with market-oriented socio-economies tend to agree on global issues&lt;ref name = &quot;Mousseau 2003&quot; /&gt; and not a single fatality has occurred in any dispute between them.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mousseau 2009&quot; /&gt;

Economic norms theory should not be confused with classical liberal theory. The latter assumes that markets are natural and that freer markets promote wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton]]. 1970. ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]''. Chicago: University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Economic norms theory shows how market-contracting is a learned norm, and state spending, regulation, and redistribution are necessary to ensure that almost everyone can participate in the &quot;social market&quot; economy, which is in everyone's interests. One proposed mechanism for world peace involves consumer purchasing of renewable and equitable local food and power sources involving [[artificial photosynthesis]] ushering in a period of social and ecological harmony known as the [[Sustainocene]].

=== Nonkilling Global Political Science ===
[[Nonkilling]], popularized in the 2002 book ''[[Nonkilling Global Political Science]]'' by [[Glenn D. Paige]], builds on [[nonviolence]] theory and encompasses the concepts of [[peace]] (absence of war and conditions conducive to war), [[nonviolence]] (psychological, physical, and structural), and [[ahimsa]] (noninjury in thought, word and deed). Nonkilling provides a distinct approach characterized by the measurability of its goals and the open-ended nature of its realization. It can be quantified and related to specific causes, for example by following a public health perspective (prevention, intervention and post-traumatic transformation toward the progressive eradication of killing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=DeGue|first=Sarah|title=Toward a nonkilling paradigm|last2=Mercy|first2=James A.|date=2009|publisher=Center for Global Nonkilling|others=Pim, Joám Evans.|year=2009|isbn=978-0-9822983-1-2|edition=1st|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|pages=388|chapter=Nonkilling public health|oclc=463312339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Day of Peace==
The [[International Day of Peace]], sometimes called World Peace Day, is observed annually on 21 September. It is dedicated to peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, and can be celebrated by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone. The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the United Nations General Assembly. Two decades later, in 2001, the General Assembly unanimously voted to designate the day as a day of preventing violence and a cease-fire. The celebration of this day is recognized by many nations and people. In 2013, for the first time, the day has been dedicated to [[peace education]], i.e. by the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably.

==Religious views==
[[File:Mt. Ecclesia-3.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|A long-standing suggestion for World Peace Meditation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/pamen050.htm Suggestion For World Peace Meditation]. [[Mount Ecclesia]], CA, USA&lt;/ref&gt; along with annual purposeful devotional dates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/docs/dates2017s_eng.pdf World Peace Meditation: 2017 Devotional Services Dates and Times]. Mount Ecclesia, CA, USA&lt;/ref&gt; as faithfully performed by a [[fraternal organization]] whose founder taught, in the 1910s, that &quot;'''[[Peace education|Peace is a matter of education]]''', and impossible of achievement until we have learned to deal charitably, justly, and openly with one another, as nations as well as [[individual]]s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]]. ''Letters to Students'': LETTER NO. 92, July 1918. [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|TRF]], CA, USA (various editions/publishers)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many religions and religious leaders have expressed a desire for an end to violence.

===Baháʼí Faith===
{{Main|Baháʼí Faith and the unity of humanity}}
The central aim of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] is the establishment of the unity of the peoples of the world. [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, stated in no uncertain terms, &quot;the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race ...&quot; In his writings, Bahá'u'lláh described two distinct stages of world peace – a lesser peace and a sense of most great peace.

The lesser peace is essentially a collective security agreement between the nations of the world. In this arrangement, nations agree to protect one another by rising up against an aggressor nation, should it seek the usurpation of territory or the destruction of its neighbors. The lesser peace is limited in scope and is concerned with the establishment of basic order and the universal recognition of national borders and the sovereignty of nations. Baháʼís believe that the lesser peace is taking place largely through the operation of the Divine Will and that Baháʼí influence on the process is relatively minor.

The greatest peace is the eventual end goal of the lesser peace and is envisioned as a time of spiritual and social unity – a time when the peoples of the world genuinely identify with and care for one another, rather than simply tolerating one other's existence. The Baháʼís view this process as taking place largely as a result of the spread of Baháʼí teachings, principles, and practices throughout the world. The larger world peace process and its foundational elements are addressed in the document ''[[The Promise of World Peace]]'', written by the [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/363 363–364] |url=https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism}}
Many [[Buddhist]]s believe that world peace can only be achieved if individuals establish [[peace]] within their minds first. The [[Buddha]]'s teachings emphasize that [[anger]] and other negative states of [[mind]] are the cause of wars and fighting. Buddhists believe people can live in [[peace]] and [[harmony]] only if they abandon negative emotions such as anger and cultivate positive emotions such as loving-kindness and [[compassion]].  As with all [[Dharmic religions],] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

{{quote|Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world. By non-hatred alone is hatred appeased. This is a law eternal.|[[Siddhārtha Gautama]], The [[Dhammapada]]: Pairs Verse 5&lt;ref name=&quot;The Dhammapada&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Buddharakkhita |first1=Acharya |title=The Dhammapada: The Buddha's Path of Wisdom |url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.01.budd.html |website=accesstoinsight.org |publisher=Access to Insight Organisation |accessdate=17 September 2020 |ref=Dhammapada: Pairs V}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peace pagoda]]s are monuments that are built to symbolize and inspire world peace and have been central to the peace movement throughout the years. These are typical of Buddhist origin, being built by the Japanese Buddhist organization [[Nipponzan Myohoji]]. They exist around the world in cities such as London, Vienna, New Delhi, Tokyo, and [[Lumbini]].

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian pacifism}}
The basic Christian ideal specifies that [[peace]] can only come by the Word and love of God, which is perfectly demonstrated in the life of Christ:

{{quote|Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.|{{bibleref|John|14:27|NIV}}}}

As [[christological]]ly interpreted from {{bibleref|Isaiah|2|NIV}}, whereupon the  &quot;Word of the Lord&quot; is established on the earth, the material human-political result will be 'nation not taking up sword against nation; nor will they train for war anymore'. Christian world peace necessitates the living of a proactive life replete with all good works indirect light of the Word of God. The details of such a life can be observed in the Gospels, especially the historically renowned [[Sermon on the Mount]], where [[forgiveness|forgiving]] those who do wrong things against oneself is advocated among other pious precepts.

However, not all Christians expect a lasting world peace on this earth:

{{quote|Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.|{{bibleverse|Matt|10:34–36|NIV}}}}

Many Christians believe that world peace is expected to be manifest upon the &quot;new earth&quot; that is promised in Christian scripture such as {{bibleref|Revelation|21|NIV}}.

The [[Roman Catholic]] religious conception of &quot;[[Consecration of Russia]]&quot;, related to the Church's high-priority [[Our Lady of Fátima|Fátima]] [[Marian apparitions]], promises a temporary ''world peace'' as a result of this process being fulfilled, though before the coming of the [[Antichrist]]. This period of temporary peace is called ''the triumph of the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart]]''.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hinduism}}
Traditionally, [[Hinduism]] has adopted an ancient [[Sanskrit]] phrase ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam|Vasudhaiva kutumbakam]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindudharmaforums.com/showthread.php?t=969&amp;page=3|title=Dharmic Wisdom Quotes – Page 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates as &quot;The world is one family&quot;. The essence of this concept is the observation that only base minds see dichotomies and divisions. The more we seek wisdom, the more we become inclusive and free our internal spirit from worldly illusions or ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]''. World peace is hence only achieved through internal means—by liberating ourselves from artificial boundaries that separate us all.  As with all [[Dharmic religions],] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic Peace}}

According to [[Islamic eschatology]], the whole world will be united under the leadership of imam [[Mahdi]]. At that time love, justice and peace will be so abundant that the world will be in the likeness of [[paradise]].

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism}}

The concept of ''[[Tikkun olam]]'' (Repairing the World) is central to modern [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. ''Tikkun Olam'' is accomplished through various means, such as ritualistically performing God's commandments, charity, and social justice, as well as through example persuading the rest of the world to behave morally. According to some views, ''Tikkun Olam'' would result at the beginning of the [[Messianic Age]]. It has been said that in every generation, a person is born with the potential to be the spiritual [[Mashiach|Messiah]]. If the time is right for the Messianic Age within that person's lifetime, then that person will be the Mashiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the Messiah, then that person is not the Messiah (Mashiach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, in [[Jewish messianism]] it is considered that at some future time a ''Messiah'' (literally &quot;an anointed King appointed by God&quot;) will rise up to bring all Jews back to the [[Land of Israel]], and to establish God's Torah, followed by everlasting global peace and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam, [[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot Melachim, ch. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; This idea originates from passages in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Talmud]].
{{quote|For Torah will go forth from Zion and the Word of HaShem from Jerusalem. And He will judge between the nations and decide disputes for many peoples, and they will beat their [[Swords to plowshares |swords into plowshares]] and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not lift the sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.|{{bibleref|Isaiah|2:3-4|JPR}}}}

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jainism}}
[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Compassion for all life, human and non-human]], is central to [[Jainism]]. They have adopted the wordings of Lord Mahavira [[Jiyo our Jeeno Do]]. Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment; to kill any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is a religion that requires monks and laity, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian. Some Indian regions, such as [[Gujarat]], have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination have also become vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, Kurt, Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence, Motilal Banarsidass, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Famous quote on world peace as per Jainism by a 19th-century Indian legend, [[Virchand Gandhi]]: &quot;May peace rule the universe; may peace rule in kingdoms and empires; may peace rule in states and in the lands of the potentates; may peace rule in the house of friends and may peace also rule in the house of enemies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Useful instructions, In Matter religious, moral and others by Motilal M. Munishi, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

===Sikhism===
{{Main|Sikhism}}
Peace comes from God.  Meditation, the means of communicating with God, is unfruitful without the noble character of a devotee, there can be no worship without performing good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Angela|title=Movement and Change|year=1997|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780174370673|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guru Nanak stressed now ''[[kirat karō]]'': that a Sikh should balance work, worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, fellow human beings. They are encouraged to have a ''[[chaṛdī kalā]]'', or ''optimistic'' – ''resilience'', view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing—''[[vaṇḍ chakkō]]''—through the distribution of free food at Sikh [[gurdwara]]s (''[[Langar (Sikhism)|laṅgar]]''), giving charitable donations, and working for the good of the community and others (''[[Selfless service|sēvā]]''). Sikhs believe that no matter what race, sex, or religion one is, all are equal in God's eyes. Men and women are equal and share the same rights, and women can lead to prayers. As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

==Economic implications==
A report in June 2015 on the [[Global Peace Index]] highlighted that the impact of violence on the global economy reached US$14.3&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-33161837|title=Global conflicts 'cost 13% of world GDP'|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also found that the economic cost of violence is 13.4% of world GDP, equal to the total economic output of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the UK combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{site web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/global-cost-conflict-reaches-14tn-says-report|title=Global cost of conflict reaches $14.3tn, says report|author=Mark Anderson|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''treeshrews''' (or '''tree shrews''' or '''banxrings'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Americana |wstitle=Tree-shrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are small [[mammal]]s native to the [[tropical forest]]s of [[Southeast Asia]]. They make up the entire [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Scandentia''', which split into two [[Family (biology)|families]]: the [[Tupaiidae]] (19 species, &quot;ordinary&quot; treeshrews), and the [[Ptilocercidae]] (one species, the [[pen-tailed treeshrew]]).

Though called 'treeshrews', and despite having previously been classified in [[Insectivora]], they are not true [[shrew]]s, and not all species [[Arboreal|live in trees]]. They are [[omnivore]]s; among other things, treeshrews eat fruit.

Treeshrews have a higher [[brain to body mass ratio]] than any other mammal, including [[human]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genome.wustl.edu/genomes/view/tupaia_belangeri |title=an article on Tupaia belangeri |department=The Genome Institute |publisher=Washington University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601201841/https://www.genome.wustl.edu/genomes/view/tupaia_belangeri |archive-date=2010-06-01 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but high ratios are not uncommon for animals weighing less than {{convert|1|kg|lbs|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}.

Among orders of mammals, treeshrews are closely related to [[primates]], and have been used as an alternative to primates in experimental studies of [[myopia in animals|myopia]], psychosocial stress, and [[hepatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cao |first1=J. |last2= Yang |first2=E.B. |last3=Su |first3=J.-J. |last4=Li |first4=Y. |last5=Chow |first5=P. |title=The tree shrews: Adjuncts and alternatives to primates as models for biomedical research |journal=Journal of Medical Primatology |year=2003 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=123–130 |url=http://www.unifr.ch/inph/vclab/assets/files/PDFs/Caoetal.pdf |access-date=1 January 2012 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0684.2003.00022.x |pmid=12823622 |s2cid=16910445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

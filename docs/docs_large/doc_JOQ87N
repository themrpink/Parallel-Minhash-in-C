In [[telecommunication]], '''release time''' is the [[time]] interval for a [[Circuit (electronic)|circuit]] to respond when an enabling signal is discontinued, for example:
#in an [[automatic gain control]] or [[echo suppressor]] circuit, the time interval between the end of the enabling signal and the instant at which suppression ceases,
#for a [[relay]], the time between when the coil is de-energized, and the instant that contact closure ceases or is established.

In [[telecommunication]]s, '''remote call forwarding''' is a [[service feature]] that allows incoming calls to be forwarded to a remote [[call forwarding]] number, such as a cell phone or another office location and is designated by the [[called party|call receiver]].&lt;ref name=Hoxie2010&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hoxie|first=Mark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYALAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123|title=90 Days to Success Marketing and Advertising Your Small Business|date=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=978-1-4354-5829-1|location=|pages=123|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Black2001&gt;{{Cite book|last=Black|first=Sharon K.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IxHIYjw0ywwC&amp;pg=PA104|title=Telecommunications Law in the Internet Age|date=2001|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=978-0-08-051868-8|location=|pages=104|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customers may have a remote-forwarding [[telephone number]] in a central [[telephone exchange|switching]] office without having any other local telephone service in that office.

One common purpose for this service is to enable customers to retain their telephone number when they move to a location serviced by a different telephone exchange. The service is useful for business customers with widely advertised numbers which appear on headed paper, vehicles and various marketing literature. When customers ring, their calls are forwarded to the new location.

Remote call forwarding is also a means for a suburban business to obtain a city-centre local number (with its full large-city coverage area) for inbound calls; while cheaper than a [[foreign exchange line]], this can reduce [[long-distance telephony]] costs in markets where local calls are flat-rated but trunk calls are expensive.

One alternative to RCF is Caller Redirect whereby callers simply hear an intercept message notifying them that the number has changed. Another alternative is to port the existing number to a [[voice over IP]] carrier, which is not tied to a single physical location as the subscriber may be anywhere on broadband Internet.  However, not all phone numbers can be ported.

==Remote Access to Call Forwarding==
Remote Call Forwarding (RCF) requires neither a physical telephone set nor physical input by customer to get calls forwarded.

In this respect, it differs from the (similarly named) Remote Access to Call Forwarding in that the number is attached to a physical line where it rings normally until a call is made to a remote number to enable redirection.

To activate Remote Access to Call Forwarding, a subscriber calls a provider-supplied Remote Access Directory Number, enters the telephone number of the line to be redirected along with a [[personal identification number]] (PIN), a [[vertical service code]] (such as 72# or *73) and the number to which the calls are to be forwarded.

Remote Access to Call Forwarding allows incoming calls to be diverted and answered elsewhere if a subscriber cannot use their telephone normally (for instance, the number is assigned to a lost or stolen wireless handset or to a landline in need of repair service). In some cases, a business which subscribes to standard [[call forwarding]] (*72) may be able to request temporary redirection of inbound calls when calling a telco repair service number (such as 6-1-1) to report a line outage.

[[File:Repeater-schema.svg|thumb|A radio repeater retransmits a radio signal.]]
In [[telecommunications]], a '''repeater''' is an electronic device that receives a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] and retransmits it. Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction.
Some types of repeaters broadcast an identical signal, but alter its method of transmission, for example, on another frequency or [[baud rate]].

There are several different types of repeaters; a '''telephone repeater''' is an [[amplifier]] in a [[telephone line]], an [[optical repeater]] is an [[optoelectronic]] circuit that amplifies the light beam in an [[optical fiber cable]]; and a [[radio repeater]] is a [[radio receiver]] and [[transmitter]] that retransmits a radio signal.

A [[broadcast relay station]] is a repeater used in [[Broadcasting|broadcast radio and television]].

==Overview==
When an information-bearing signal passes through a [[communication channel]], it is progressively degraded due to loss of power.  For example, when a [[telephone call]] passes through a wire [[telephone line]], some of the power in the [[electric current]] which represents the [[audio signal]] is dissipated as heat in the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the copper wire.  The longer the wire is, the more power is lost, and the smaller the [[amplitude]] of the signal at the far end. So with a long enough wire the call will not be audible at the other end.  Similarly, the farther from a [[radio station]] a [[radio receiver|receiver]] is, the weaker the [[radio signal]], and the poorer the reception. A repeater is an electronic device in a communication channel that increases the power of a signal and retransmits it, allowing it to travel further.  Since it [[amplifier|amplifies]] the signal, it requires a source of [[electric power]].

The term &quot;repeater&quot; originated with [[telegraphy]] in the 19th century, and referred to an [[electromechanical]] device (a [[relay]]) used to regenerate [[telegraph]] signals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loring&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term has continued in [[telephony]] and [[data]] [[telecommunication|communications]].

In [[computer networking]], because repeaters work with the actual physical signal, and do not attempt to interpret the data being transmitted, they operate on the [[physical layer]], the first layer of the [[OSI model]].

==Types==

===Telephone repeater===
This is used to increase the range of telephone signals in a [[telephone line]].

:* '''Land line repeater'''
They are most frequently used in [[Telecommunications link|trunkline]]s that carry [[Long-distance calling|long distance]] calls.  In an [[Analog signal|analog]] telephone line consisting of a pair of wires, it consists of an [[amplifier]] circuit made of [[transistor]]s which use power from a DC current source to increase the power of the [[alternating current]] [[audio signal]] on the line.  Since the telephone is a [[duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]] (bidirectional) communication system, the wire pair carries two audio signals, one going in each direction.  So telephone repeaters have to be bilateral, amplifying the signal in both directions without causing feedback, which complicates their design considerably.  Telephone repeaters were the first type of repeater and were some of the first applications of [[Amplifier|amplification]].  The development of telephone repeaters between 1900 and 1915 made long distance phone service possible. Now, most telecommunications cables are [[fiber optic cable]]s which use optical repeaters (below).

Before the invention of electronic amplifiers, mechanically coupled [[Microphone#Carbon microphone|carbon microphones]] were used as amplifiers in telephone repeaters. After the turn of the 20th century it was found that negative resistance mercury lamps could amplify, and they were used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sungook&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In the 1930s [[vacuum tube]] repeaters using [[hybrid coil]]s became commonplace, allowing the use of thinner wires.  In the 1950s [[negative resistance|negative impedance]] gain devices were more popular, and a [[transistor]]ized version called the E6 repeater was the final major type used in the [[Bell System]] before the low cost of digital transmission made all [[voiceband]] repeaters obsolete. [[Frequency frogging]] repeaters were commonplace in frequency-division multiplexing systems from the middle to late 20th century.

:* '''Submarine cable repeater'''
This is a type of telephone repeater used in underwater [[submarine telecommunications cable]]s.
 
===Optical communications repeater===
{{main|Optical communications repeater}}
This is used to increase the range of signals in a [[fiber optic cable]].  Digital information travels through a fiber optic cable in the form of short pulses of light.  The light is made up of particles called [[photon]]s, which can be absorbed or scattered in the fiber.  An optical communications repeater usually consists of a [[phototransistor]] which converts the light pulses to an electrical signal, an [[amplifier]] to increase the power of the signal, an [[electronic filter]] which reshapes the pulses, and a [[laser]] which converts the electrical signal to light again and sends it out the other fiber.  However, [[optical amplifier]]s are being developed for repeaters to amplify the light itself without the need of converting it to an electric signal first.

===Radio repeater===
[[File:Repeater Talk around channel.png|thumb|A radio communications with a Repeater or a Talkaround channel]]
[[File:Repetitor Guarini.jpg|thumb|Guarini-Foresio's repeater]]
 
This is used to extend the range of '''coverage''' of a [[radio]] signal. The history of radio relay repeaters began in 1898 from the publication by Johann Mattausch in Austrian Journal Zeitschrift für Electrotechnik (v. 16,
35 - 36).&lt;ref name=slyusar_relay/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mattausch J. Telegraphie ohne Draht. Eine Studie. // Zeitschrift für Elektrotechnik. Organ des Elektrotechnischen Vereines in Wien.- Heft 3, 16. Jänner 1898. - XVI. Jahrgang. - S. 35–36.[http://www.slyusar.kiev.ua/all/zeitschriftfrele16.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; But his proposal &quot;Translator&quot; was primitive and not suitable for use. The first relay system with radio repeaters, which really functioned, was that invented in 1899 by Emile Guarini-Foresio.&lt;ref name=slyusar_relay /&gt;

A radio repeater usually consists of a [[radio receiver]] connected to a [[radio transmitter]].  The received signal is amplified and retransmitted, often on another frequency, to provide coverage beyond the obstruction.  Usage of a [[duplexer]] can allow the repeater to use one antenna for both receive and transmit at the same time.

:* '''[[Broadcast relay station]], rebroadcastor''' or '''translator''': This is a repeater used to extend the coverage of a radio or television [[Broadcasting|broadcasting station]].  It consists of a secondary radio or television transmitter.  The signal from the main transmitter often comes over leased telephone lines or by microwave relay.

:* '''[[Microwave relay]]''': This is a specialized [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] telecommunications link, consisting of a [[microwave]] [[radio receiver|receiver]] that receives information over a beam of microwaves from another relay station in [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] distance, and a microwave [[transmitter]] which passes the information on to the next station over another beam of microwaves.  Networks of microwave relay stations transmit telephone calls, television programs, and computer data from one city to another over continent-wide areas.

::* '''[[Passive repeater]]''': This is a microwave relay that simply consists of a flat metal surface to reflect the microwave beam in another direction.  It is used to get microwave relay signals over hills and mountains when it is not necessary to amplify the signal.

:* '''[[Cellular repeater]]''': This is a radio repeater for boosting [[cell phone]] reception in a limited area.  The device functions like a small [[cellular base station]], with a directional antenna to receive the signal from the nearest cell tower, an amplifier, and a local antenna to rebroadcast the signal to nearby cell phones.  It is often used in downtown office buildings.

:* '''Digipeater''': A repeater node in a [[packet radio]] network.  It performs a [[store and forward]] function, passing on packets of information from one node to another.

:* '''[[Amateur radio repeater]]''': Used by amateur radio operators to enable two-way communication across an area which would otherwise be difficult by point-to-point on VHF and UHF. These repeaters are set up and maintained by individual operators or clubs, and are generally available for any licensed amateur to use. A hill or mountaintop location is a preferable location to construct a repeater, as it will maximize the usability across a large area.

Radio repeaters improve communication coverage in systems using frequencies that typically have [[line-of-sight propagation]]. Without a repeater, these systems are limited in range by the curvature of the Earth and the blocking effect of terrain or high buildings. A repeater on a hilltop or tall building can allow stations that are out of each other's line-of-sight range to communicate reliably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taitradioacademy.com/topic/repeater-systems-1/   |title=   Radio Awareness about Communications Systems - HOW DO REPEATER SYSTEMS WORK? |publisher= .taitradioacademy.com/|date= |accessdate=2017-08-23 |language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio repeaters may also allow translation from one set of radio frequencies to another, for example to allow two different public service agencies to interoperate (say, police and fire services of a city, or neighboring police departments).  They may provide links to the public switched telephone network as well.

Typically a repeater station listens on one frequency, A, and transmits on a second, B.  All mobile stations listen for signals on channel B and transmit on channel A.  The difference between the two frequencies may be relatively small compared to the frequency of operation, say 1%.  Often the repeater station will use the same antenna for transmission and reception; highly selective filters called &quot;duplexers&quot; separate the faint incoming received signal from the billions of times more powerful outbound transmitted signal.  Sometimes separate transmitting and receiving locations are used, connected by a wire line or a radio link. While the repeater station is designed for simultaneous reception and transmission, mobile units need not be equipped with the bulky and costly duplexers, as they only transmit or receive at any time.

Mobile units in a repeater system may be provided with a &quot;talkaround&quot; channel that allows direct mobile-to-mobile operation on a single channel. This may be used if out of reach of the repeater system, or for communications not requiring the attention of all mobiles. The &quot;talkaround&quot; channel may be the repeater output frequency; the repeater will not retransmit any signals on its output frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Land mobile radio systems - 2nd ed.

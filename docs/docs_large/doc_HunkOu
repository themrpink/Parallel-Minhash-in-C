==Demographics==
[[File:Liesse populaire dans les rues de Kinshasa hier soir à la suite de la qualification de l’équipe nationale de la RD Congo.jpg|thumb|Kinshasa in 2016]]
An official census conducted in 1984 counted 2.6&amp;nbsp;million residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bédécarrats2016&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bédécarrats |first=Florent |last2=Lafuente-Sampietro |first2=Oriane |last3=Leménager |first3=Martin |last4=Lukono Sowa |first4=Dominique |year=2019 |title=Building commons to cope with chaotic urbanization?

The estimates for 2005 fell in a range between 5.3&amp;nbsp;million and 7.3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Flouriot2013 /&gt; In 2017, the most recent population estimate for the city, it has a population of 11,855,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503021711/http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf |archive-date=3 May 2018 |access-date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UN-Habitat, 390,000 people immigrate to Kinshasa annually, fleeing warfare and seeking economic opportunity. Many float on barges down the Congo River.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iazzolino2016&quot;&gt;Gianluca Iazzolino, &quot;[http://mgafrica.com/article/2016-03-29-kinshasa-the-dysfunctional-megapolis-of-12-million-souls Kinshasa, megalopolis of 12 million souls, expanding furiously on super-charged growth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709174042/http://mgafrica.com/article/2016-03-29-kinshasa-the-dysfunctional-megapolis-of-12-million-souls |date=9 July 2017 }}&quot;; ''Mail &amp; Guardian Africa'', 2 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a projection (2016) the population of metropolitan Kinshasa will increase significantly, to 35 million by 2050, 58 million by 2075 and 83 million by 2100,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hoornweg |first=Daniel |last2=Pope |first2=Kevin |year=2017 |title=Population predictions for the world's largest cities in the 21st century |journal=Environment and Urbanization |volume=29 |pages=195–216 |doi=10.1177/0956247816663557 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world.

===Language===
The official language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, of which Kinshasa is the capital, is French (See: [[African French#Kinshasa French vocabulary|Kinshasa French vocabulary]]). Kinshasa is the largest officially Francophone city in the world&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |date=7 March 2016 |title=Populations of 150 Largest Cities in the World |url=http://www.worldatlas.com/citypops.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828095658/http://www.worldatlas.com/citypops.htm |archive-date=28 August 2017 |access-date=1 August 2016 |website=World Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nadeau&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nadeau |first=Jean-Benoit |title=The Story of French |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780312341831 |page=301; 483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trefon&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Trefon |first=Theodore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VAAHi93y0sC&amp;q=Kinshasa+second+largest+French+city&amp;pg=PA7 |title=Reinventing Order in the Congo: How People Respond to State Failure in Kinshasa |publisher=Zed Books |year=2004 |isbn=9781842774915 |location=London and New York |page=7 |access-date=31 May 2009}}
A third factor is simply a demographic one. At least one in ten Congolese live in Kinshasa. With its population exceeding eleven million, it is the second-largest city in sub-Saharan Africa (after Lagos). It is also the second-largest French-speaking city in the world, according to Paris (even though only a small percentage of Kinois speak French correctly),&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Lingala]] is widely used as a spoken language. French is the language of street signs, posters, newspapers, government documents, schools; it dominates plays, television, and the press, and it is used in vertical relationships among people of different social classes. People of the same class, however, speak the Congolese languages (Kikongo, Lingala, Tshiluba or Swahili) among themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Manning |first=Patrick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwzFF2FnbzMC&amp;q=Kinshasa+second+largest+francophone+city&amp;pg=PA189 |title=Francophone sub-Saharan Africa: Democracy and Dependence, 1985–1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780521645195 |location=London and New York |page=189 |access-date=31 May 2009}}

While the culture is dominated by the Francophonie, a complex multilingualism is present in Kinshasa. Many in the francophonie of the 1980s labelled Zaïre as the second-largest francophone country, and Kinshasa as the second-largest francophone city. Yet Zaïre seemed unlikely to escape a complex multilingualism. Lingala was the language of music, of presidential addresses, of daily life in government and in Kinshasa. But if Lingala was the spoken language of Kinshasa, it made little progress as a written language. French was the written language of the city, as seen in street signs, posters, newspapers and in government documents. French dominated plays and television as well as the press; French was the language of the national anthem and even for the doctrine of authenticity. Zairian researchers found French to be used in vertical relationships among people of uneven rank; people of equal rank, no matter how high, tended to speak Zairian languages among themselves. Given these limits, French might have lost its place to another of the leading languages of Zaïre – Lingala, Tshiluba, or [[Swahili language|Swahili]] – except that teaching of these languages also suffered from limitations on its growth.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government and politics ==
The head of Kinshasa ''ville-province'' has the title of [[List of Governors of Kinshasa|Gouverneur]]. [[Gentiny Ngobila]] has been governor since 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=5 May 2019 |title=Kinshasa : la lutte contre l'insécurité et l'insalubrité, priorités de Gentiny Ngobila |work=Radio Okapi |agency=ACP |url=https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/05/08/actualite/politique/kinshasa-la-lutte-contre-linsecurite-et-linsalubrite-priorites-de |url-status=live |access-date=11 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511215019/https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/05/08/actualite/politique/kinshasa-la-lutte-contre-linsecurite-et-linsalubrite-priorites-de |archive-date=11 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each commune has its own [[Burgomaster|Bourgmestre]].&lt;ref name=Flouriot2013 /&gt;

Although political power in the DRC is fragmented, Kinshasa as the national capital represents the official center of sovereignty, and thus of access to international organizations and financing, and of political powers such as the right to issue [[Democratic Republic of the Congo passport|passports]].&lt;ref name=Trapido2016 /&gt; Kinshasa is also the [[primate city]] of the DRC with a population several times larger than the next-largest city, [[Lubumbashi]].&lt;ref&gt;Pain (1984), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ChirisaEtAl2017 /&gt;

Since 1991, Monkole Hospital is operating as a non-profit health institution collaborating with the Health Department as district hospital in Kinshasa. Directed by Pr Léon Tshilolo, paediatrician and haematologist, Monkole Hospital opened a 150-bed building in 2012 with improved clinical services as laboratory, diagnostic radiology, intensive care, neonatal unit, family medicine, emergencies unit and a larger surgical area.

== Culture ==
There are the [[National Museum of the Democratic Republic of Congo|National Museum]] and the [[Kinshasa Fine Arts Academy]].

Kinshasa is the home to much of the Congo's [[intelligentsia]], including a political class which developed during the Mobutu era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freund2012&quot;&gt;Bill Freund, &quot;City and Nation in an African Context: National Identity in Kinshasa”; ''Journal of Urban History'' 38(5), 2012; [[doi:10.1177/0096144212449141]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinshasa has a flourishing music scene which since the 1960s has operated under the patronage of the city's elite.&lt;ref name=Trapido2016 /&gt; The [[Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste]], formed in 1994, began using improved musical instruments and has since grown in means and reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Morgan, &quot;The scratch orchestra of Kinshasa&quot;, ''The Guardian'' 9 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Kinshasa hosted [[The Rumble in the Jungle]] boxing match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]], in which Ali defeated Foreman, to regain the World [[Heavyweight]] title.

A pop culture ideal type in Kinshasa is the ''mikiliste'', a fashionable person with money who has traveled to Europe. [[Adrien Mombele]], a.k.a. Stervos Niarcos, and musician [[Papa Wemba]], were early exemplars of the mikiliste style.&lt;ref name=Trapido2016 /&gt; [[La Sape]], a linked cultural trend also described as [[dandy]]ism, involves wearing flamboyant clothing.

Many Kinois have a negative view of the city, expressing nostalgia for the rural way of life, and a stronger association with the Congolese nation than with Kinshasa.&lt;ref name=Freund2012 /&gt;

== Places of worship ==
Among the [[places of worship]], which are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples: [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kinshasa]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Kimbanguist Church]], [[Baptist Community of Congo]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Baptist Community of the Congo River]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Assemblies of God]], [[Province of the Anglican Church of the Congo]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), [[Presbyterian Community in Congo]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]).&lt;ref&gt;J.

Most of the media uses French and Lingala to a large extent; very few use the other national languages.

== Sports ==
[[File:Martyrs stadium.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Stade des Martyrs]]]]
[[Sports]], especially [[association football|football]] and [[martial arts]] are popular in Kinshasa. The [[AS Vita Club|Vita Club]], [[DC Motema Pembe|Daring Club Motema Pembe]] and [[As Dragon]] frequently draws large crowds, enthusiastic and sometimes rowdy, to the [[Stade des Martyrs]]. [[Dojo]]s are popular and their owners influential.&lt;ref name=Trapido2016 /&gt;

Kinshasa is home to the country's national stadium, the [[Stade des Martyrs]] (Stadium of the Martyrs).

==Buildings and institutions==
[[File:Palais du peuple de la RDC.jpg|thumb|The People's Palace, seat of the Congolese parliament]]
Kinshasa is home to the [[Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] including: 
* the [[Palais de la Nation (Kinshasa)|Palais de la Nation]], home of the [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]], in Gombe;
* the [[Palais du Peuple (Kinshasa)|Palais du Peuple]], meeting place of both houses of Parliament, [[Senate (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Senate]] and [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|National Assembly]], in [[Lingwala]];
* the [[Palais de Justice (Kinshasa)|Palais de Justice]], in Gombe;
* the [[Cité de l’OUA]], built for the [[Organization of African Unity]] in the 1970s and now serving government functions, in [[Ngaliema]].

The [[Central Bank of the Congo]] has its headquarters on Boulevard Colonel Tshatshi, across the street from the Mausoleum of Laurent Kabila and the presidential palace.

The quartier [[Matonge (Kinshasa)|Matonge]] is known regionally for its [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]].

Notable features of the city include the Gecamines Commercial Building (formerly SOZACOM) and [[Hotel Memling]] skyscrapers; [[L'ONATRA]], the impressive building of the Ministry of Transport; the central market; the [[Tour de l'Echangeur]]. The face of Kinshasa is changing as new buildings are being built on the Boulevard du 30 Juin: Crown Tower (on Batetela) and Congofutur Tower.

== Infrastructure and housing ==
The city's infrastructure for [[running water]] and electricity is generally in bad shape.&lt;ref&gt;Nzuzi (2008), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[electric power distribution|electrical network]] is in disrepair to the extent that prolonged and periodic [[power outage|blackouts]] are normal, and exposed [[electrical wiring|lines]] sometimes electrify pools of rainwater.&lt;ref name=Trapido2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Flouriot2013 /&gt;

[[Regideso]], the national public company with primary responsibility for water supply in the Congo, serves Kinshasa only incompletely, and not with uniformly perfect quality. Other areas are served by decentralized ''Associations des Usagers des Réseau d’Eau Potable'' (ASUREPs).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bédécarrats2016&quot; /&gt; Gombe uses water at a high rate (306 liters per day per inhabitant) compared to other communes (from 71 l/d/i in Kintambo down to 2 l/d/i in Kimbanseke).&lt;ref name=Flouriot2013 /&gt;

The city is estimated to produce 6,300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of trash and 1,300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of industrial waste per day.&lt;ref name=Flouriot2013 /&gt;

The housing market has seen rising prices and [[Renting|rent]]s since the 1980s. Houses and apartments in the central area are expensive, with houses selling for a million dollars and apartments going for $5000 per month. High prices have spread outward from the central area as owners and renters move out of the most expensive part of the city. [[Gated communities]] and shopping malls, built with foreign capital and technical expertise, began to appear in 2006. [[Urban renewal]] projects have led in some cases to violent conflict and displacement.&lt;ref name=Trapido2016 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aurélie Fontaine, &quot;Housing: Kinshasa is for the rich”; ''Africa Report'' 5 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The high prices leave incoming refugees with few options for settlement besides illegal [[shantytown]]s such as Pakadjuma.&lt;ref name=Iazzolino2016 /&gt;

In 2005, 55% of households had televisions and 43% had mobile phones. 11% had refrigerators and 5% had cars.&lt;ref name=Flouriot2013 /&gt;

[[File:Boulevard du 30 juin, Kinshasa.jpg|thumb|The [[Boulevard du 30 Juin]] provides an artery to the business district in [[La Gombe|Gombe, Kinshasa]].]]

The ville-province has 5000&amp;nbsp;km of roadways, 10% of which are paved. The [[Boulevard du 30 Juin]] (Boulevard of 30 June) links the main areas of the central district of the city. Other roads also converge on Gombe. The east-west road network linking the more distant neighborhoods is weak and thus transit through much of the city is difficult.&lt;ref name=Flouriot2013 /&gt; The quality of roads has improved somewhat, developed in part with loans from China, since 2000.&lt;ref name=Trapido2016 /&gt;

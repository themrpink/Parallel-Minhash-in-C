[[File:Cycloid f.gif|right|frame|A cycloid generated by a rolling circle]]

In [[geometry]], a '''cycloid''' is the [[curve]] traced by a point on a [[circle]] as it rolls along a [[Line (geometry)|straight line]] without slipping. A cycloid is a specific form of [[trochoid]] and is an example of a [[roulette (curve)|roulette]], a curve generated by a curve rolling on another curve.

The cycloid, with the [[Cusp (singularity)|cusps]] pointing upward, is the curve of fastest descent under constant [[gravity]] (the [[brachistochrone curve]]). It is also the form of a curve for which the [[Frequency|period]] of an object in [[simple harmonic motion]] (rolling up and down repetitively) along the curve does not depend on the object's starting position (the [[tautochrone curve]]).

== History ==
{{quotebox|width=30%|
quote=It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same time.
|source=''[[Moby Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]], 1851}}

The cycloid has been called &quot;The [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of Geometers&quot; as it caused frequent quarrels among 17th-century mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Cajori | first1=Florian | author1-link=Florian Cajori | title=A History of Mathematics | publisher=Chelsea | location=New York | isbn=978-0-8218-2102-2 | year=1999 | page=177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of mathematics have proposed several candidates for the discoverer of the cycloid.  Mathematical historian [[Paul Tannery]] cited similar work by the Syrian philosopher [[Iamblichus]] as evidence that the curve was known in antiquity.&lt;ref name=Tannery/&gt;  English mathematician [[John Wallis]] writing in 1679 attributed the discovery to [[Nicholas of Cusa]],&lt;ref name=Wallis/&gt; but subsequent scholarship indicates that either Wallis was mistaken or the evidence he used is now lost.&lt;ref name=Whitman/&gt;  [[Galileo Galilei]]'s name was put forward at the end of the 19th century&lt;ref name=Cajori/&gt; and at least one author reports credit being given to [[Marin Mersenne]].&lt;ref name=Roidt/&gt; Beginning with the work of [[Moritz Cantor]]&lt;ref name=Cantor/&gt; and [[Siegmund Guenther|Siegmund Günther]],&lt;ref name=Gunther/&gt; scholars now assign priority to French mathematician [[Charles de Bovelles]]&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Victor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; based on his description of the cycloid in his ''Introductio in geometriam'', published in 1503.&lt;ref name=Bovelles/&gt;  In this work, Bovelles mistakes the arch traced by a rolling wheel as part of a larger circle with a radius 120% larger than the smaller wheel.&lt;ref name=Whitman/&gt;

Galileo originated the term ''cycloid'' and was the first to make a serious study of the curve.&lt;ref name=Whitman /&gt;  According to his student [[Evangelista Torricelli]],&lt;ref name=Torricelli/&gt; in 1599 Galileo attempted the [[Quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]] of the cycloid (determining the area under the cycloid) with an unusually empirical approach that involved tracing both the generating circle and the resulting cycloid on sheet metal, cutting them out and weighing them.  He discovered the ratio was roughly 3:1 but incorrectly concluded the ratio was an irrational fraction, which would have made quadrature impossible.&lt;ref name=Roidt/&gt;  Around 1628, [[Gilles de Roberval|Gilles Persone de Roberval]] likely learned of the quadrature problem from [[Marin Mersenne|Père Marin Mersenne]] and effected the quadrature in 1634 by using [[Cavalieri's principle|Cavalieri's Theorem]].&lt;ref name=Whitman /&gt;  However, this work was not published until 1693 (in his ''Traité des Indivisibles'').&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

Constructing the [[tangent]] of the cycloid dates to August 1638 when Mersenne received unique methods from Roberval, [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[René Descartes]].  Mersenne passed these results along to Galileo, who gave them to his students Torricelli and Viviana, who were able to produce a quadrature.  This result and others were published by Torricelli in 1644,&lt;ref name=Torricelli/&gt; which is also the first printed work on the cycloid.  This led to Roberval charging Torricelli with plagiarism, with the controversy cut short by Torricelli's early death in 1647.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

In 1658, Blaise Pascal had given up mathematics for theology but, while suffering from a toothache, began considering several problems concerning the cycloid.  His toothache disappeared, and he took this as a heavenly sign to proceed with his research.  Eight days later he had completed his essay and, to publicize the results, proposed a contest.  Pascal proposed three questions relating to the [[Center of mass|center of gravity]], area and volume of the cycloid, with the winner or winners to receive prizes of 20 and 40 Spanish [[doubloon]]s.  Pascal, Roberval and Senator Carcavy were the judges, and neither of the two submissions (by [[John Wallis]] and [[Antoine de Lalouvère]]) were judged to be adequate.&lt;ref name=Conner /&gt;{{rp|198}}  While the contest was ongoing, [[Christopher Wren]] sent Pascal a proposal for a proof of the [[arc length|rectification]] of the cycloid; Roberval claimed promptly that he had known of the proof for years.  Wallis published Wren's proof (crediting Wren) in Wallis's ''Tractus Duo'', giving Wren priority for the first published proof.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

Fifteen years later, [[Christiaan Huygens]] had deployed the cycloidal pendulum to improve chronometers and had discovered that a particle would traverse a segment of an inverted cycloidal arch in the same amount of time, regardless of its starting point.  In 1686, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] used analytic geometry to describe the curve with a single equation.  In 1696, [[Johann Bernoulli]] posed the [[brachistochrone curve|brachistochrone problem]], the solution of which is a cycloid.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

== Equations ==
The cycloid through the origin, with a horizontal base given by the {{mvar|x}}-axis, generated by a circle of radius {{mvar|r}} rolling over the &quot;positive&quot; side of the base ({{math|''y'' ≥ 0}}), consists of the points {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}, with
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= r(t - \sin t) \\
  y &amp;= r(1 - \cos t),
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|t}} is a real [[parameter]], corresponding to the angle through which the rolling circle has rotated. For given {{mvar|t}}, the circle's centre lies at {{math|1=(''x'', ''y'') = (''rt'', ''r'')}}.

Solving for {{mvar|t}} and replacing, the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian equation]] is found to be:

:&lt;math&gt;x = r \cos^{-1} \left(1 - \frac{y}{r}\right) - \sqrt{y(2r - y)}.&lt;/math&gt;

When {{mvar|y}} is viewed as a function of {{mvar|x}}, the cycloid is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] everywhere except at the [[Cusp (singularity)|cusps]], where it hits the {{mvar|x}}-axis, with the derivative tending toward &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as one approaches a cusp. The map from {{mvar|t}} to {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} is a differentiable curve or [[parametric curve]] of class {{mvar|C}}&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, and the singularity where the derivative is 0 is an ordinary cusp.

A cycloid segment from one cusp to the next is called an arch of the cycloid. The first arch of the cycloid consists of points such that &lt;math&gt;0 \le t \le 2 \pi.&lt;/math&gt;

The equation of the cycloid satisfies the [[ordinary differential equation|differential equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elementary Differential Equations: Applications, Models, and Computing |edition=2nd illustrated |first1=Charles |last1=Roberts |publisher=CRC Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-4987-7609-7 |page=141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=touADwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=touADwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141 Extract of page 141, equation (f) with their ''K''=2''r'']&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2 = \frac{2r}{y} - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Involute==
[[File:Evolute generation.png|thumb|Generation of the involute of the cycloid unwrapping a tense wire placed on half cycloid arc (red marked)]]
The [[involute]] of the cycloid has the property of being exactly the same cycloid it originates from. This can otherwise be seen from the tip of a wire initially lying on a half arc of cycloid describing a cycloid arc equal to the one it was lying on once unwrapped (see also [[Cycloid#Cycloidal pendulum|cycloidal pendulum]] and [[Cycloid#Arc length|arc length]]).

===Demonstration===
[[File:Evolute demo.png|thumb|Demonstration of the properties of the involute of a cycloid]]
There are several demonstrations of the assertion. The one presented here uses the physical definition of cycloid and the kinematic property that the instantaneous velocity of a point is tangent to its trajectory. Referring to the adjacent picture, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; are two tangent points belonging to two rolling circles. The two circles start to roll with same speed and same direction without skidding. &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; start to draw two cycloid arcs as in the picture. Considering the line connecting &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; at an arbitrary instant (red line), it is possible to prove that ''the line is anytime tangent in &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; to the lower arc and orthogonal to the tangent in &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; of the upper arc''. One sees that calling &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; the point in common between the upper circle and the lower circle:
*&lt;math&gt;P_1,Q,P_2&lt;/math&gt; are aligned because &lt;math&gt;\widehat{P_1O_1Q}=\widehat{P_2O_2Q}&lt;/math&gt; (equal rolling speed) and therefore &lt;math&gt;\widehat{O_1QP_1}=\widehat{O_2QP_2}&lt;/math&gt; . The point &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; lies on the line &lt;math&gt;O_1O_2&lt;/math&gt; therefore &lt;math&gt;\widehat{P_1QO_1}+\widehat{P_1QO_2}=\pi&lt;/math&gt; ad analogously &lt;math&gt;\widehat{P_2QO_2}+\widehat{P_2QO_1}=\pi&lt;/math&gt;. From the equality of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{O_1QP_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{O_2QP_2}&lt;/math&gt; one has that also  &lt;math&gt;\widehat{P_1QO_2}=\widehat{P_2QO_1}&lt;/math&gt;. It follows &lt;math&gt;\widehat{P_1QO_1}+\widehat{P_2QO_1}=\pi&lt;/math&gt; .
*If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the meeting point between the perpendicular from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to the straight of &lt;math&gt;O_1O_2&lt;/math&gt; and the tangent to the circle in &lt;math&gt;P2&lt;/math&gt; , then the triangle &lt;math&gt;P_1AP_2&lt;/math&gt; is isosceles because &lt;math&gt;\widehat{QP_2A}=\frac{1}{2}\widehat{P_2O_2Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{QP_1A}=\frac{1}{2}\widehat{QO_1R}=&lt;/math&gt;(easy to prove seen the construction)&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{2}\widehat{QO_1P_1}&lt;/math&gt; . For the previous noted equality between &lt;math&gt;\widehat{P_1O_1Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{QO_2P_2}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\widehat{QP_1A}=\widehat{QP_2A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_1AP_2&lt;/math&gt; is isosceles.
*Conducting from &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; the orthogonal straight to &lt;math&gt;O_1O_2&lt;/math&gt; , from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; the straight line tangent to the upper circle and calling &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; the meeting point is now easy to see that &lt;math&gt;P_1AP_2B&lt;/math&gt; is a [[rhombus]], using the theorems concerning the angles between parallel lines
*Now consider the speed &lt;math&gt;V_2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; . It can be seen as the sum of two components, the rolling speed &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; and the drifting speed &lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt; . Both speeds are equal in modulus because the circles roll without skidding. &lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to &lt;math&gt;P_1A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; is tangent to the lower circle in &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; therefore is parallel to &lt;math&gt;P_2A&lt;/math&gt; . The rhombus constituted from the components &lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; is therefore similar (same angles) to the rhombus &lt;math&gt;BP_1AP_2&lt;/math&gt; because they have parallel sides. The total speed of &lt;math&gt;P_2,V_2&lt;/math&gt; is then parallel to &lt;math&gt;P_2P_1&lt;/math&gt; because both are diagonals of two rhombuses with parallel sides and has in common with &lt;math&gt;P_1P_2&lt;/math&gt; the contact point &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; . It follows that the speed vector &lt;math&gt;V_2&lt;/math&gt; lies on the prolongation of &lt;math&gt;P_1P_2&lt;/math&gt; . Because &lt;math&gt;V_2&lt;/math&gt; is tangent to the arc of cycloid in &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; (property of velocity of a trajectory), it follows that also &lt;math&gt;P_1P_2&lt;/math&gt; is coinciding with the tangent to the lower cycloid arc in &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.
*Analogously, it can be easily demonstrated that &lt;math&gt;P_1P_2&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; (other diagonal of the rhombus).
*The tip of an inextensible wire initially stretched on half arc of lower cycloid and bounded to the upper circle in &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; will then follow the point along its path ''without changing its length'' because the speed of the tip is at each moment orthogonal to the wire (no stretching or compression). The wire will be at the same time tangent in &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; to the lower arc because the tension and the demonstrated items. If it would not be tangent then there would be a discontinuity in &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; and consequently there would be unbalanced tension forces.

== Area ==
Using the above parameterization for one arch of a cycloid generated by a circle of radius {{mvar|r}},

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   x &amp;= r(t - \sin t) \\
   y &amp;= r(1 - \cos t)
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq t \leq 2\pi,&lt;/math&gt; the area under the arch is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  A &amp;= \int_{x=0}^{2 \pi r} y \, dx \\
    &amp;= \int_{t=0}^{2 \pi} r^2(1 - \cos t)^2 dt \\
    &amp;= 3 \pi r^2.
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This result, and some generalizations, can be obtained without calculation by Mamikon's [[visual calculus]].

== Arc length ==
[[File:Cycloid length.png|thumb|The length of the cycloid as consequence of the property of its involute]]
The arc length {{mvar|S}} of one arch is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  S &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} dt \\
    &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi} r \sqrt{2 - 2\cos t}\, dt \\
    &amp;= 2r\int_0^{2\pi} \sin \frac{t}{2}\, dt \\
    &amp;= 8r.
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Another immediate way to calculate the length of the cycloid given the properties of the [[#Involute|involute]] is to notice that when a wire describing an involute has been completely unwrapped it extends itself along two diameters, a length of {{math|4''r''}}. Because the wire does not change length during the unwrapping, it follows that the length of half an arc of cycloid is {{math|4''r''}} and that of a complete arc is {{math|8''r''}}.

== Cycloidal pendulum ==
[[File:CyloidPendulum.png|right|thumb|Schematic of a cycloidal pendulum.]]
If a simple pendulum is suspended from the cusp of an inverted cycloid, such that the &quot;string&quot; is constrained between the adjacent arcs of the cycloid, and the pendulum's length ''L'' is equal to that of half the arc length of the cycloid (i.e., twice the diameter of the generating circle, ''L=4r''), the bob of the [[pendulum]] also traces a cycloid path.  Such a cycloidal pendulum is [[Tautochrone curve|isochronous]], regardless of amplitude. Introducing a coordinate system centred in the position of the cusp, the equation of motion is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= r[2\theta(t) + \sin (2\theta (t))] \\
  y &amp;= r[-3-\cos(2\theta (t))],
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the straight part of the string with respect to the vertical axis, and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\sin\theta (t) = A \cos(\omega t),\qquad \omega^2=\frac{g}{L}=\frac{g}{4r},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A&lt;1'' is the &quot;amplitude&quot;, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the radian frequency of the pendulum and ''g'' the gravitational acceleration.

[[File:Isochronous cycloidal pendula.gif|thumb|Five isochronous cycloidal pendula with different amplitudes.]]
The 17th-century Dutch mathematician [[Christiaan Huygens#Clocks|Christiaan Huygens]] discovered and proved these properties of the cycloid while searching for more accurate pendulum clock designs to be used in navigation.&lt;ref&gt;C. Huygens, &quot;The Pendulum Clock or Geometrical Demonstrations Concerning the Motion of Pendula (sic) as Applied to Clocks,&quot; Translated by R. J. Blackwell, Iowa State University Press (Ames, Iowa, USA, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related curves ==
Several curves are related to the cycloid.
* [[Trochoid]]: generalization of a cycloid in which the point tracing the curve may be inside the rolling circle (curtate) or outside (prolate).
* [[Hypocycloid]]: variant of a cycloid in which a circle rolls on the inside of another circle instead of a line.
* [[Epicycloid]]: variant of a cycloid in which a circle rolls on the outside of another circle instead of a line.
* [[Hypotrochoid]]: generalization of a hypocycloid where the generating point may not be on the edge of the rolling circle.
* [[Epitrochoid]]: generalization of an epicycloid where the generating point may not be on the edge of the rolling circle.

All these curves are [[roulette (curve)|roulettes]] with a circle rolled along another curve of uniform [[curvature]]. The cycloid, epicycloids, and hypocycloids have the property that each is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to its [[evolute]]. If ''q'' is the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of that curvature with the circle's radius, signed positive for epi- and negative for hypo-, then the curve:evolute [[Homothetic transformation|similitude ratio]] is 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''q''.

The classic [[Spirograph]] toy traces out hypotrochoid and [[epitrochoid]] curves.

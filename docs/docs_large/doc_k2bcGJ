During a reannexation by Germany (1940–1945), High German was reinstated as the language of education. The population was forced to speak German and 'French' family names were Germanized. Following the Second World War, the 1927 regulation was not reinstated and the teaching of German in primary schools was suspended by a provisional rectorial decree, which was supposed to enable French to regain lost ground. The teaching of German became a major issue, however, as early as 1946. Following World War II, the French government pursued, in line with its traditional [[Language policy in France|language policy]], a campaign to suppress the use of German as part of a wider [[Francization]] campaign.

In 1951, Article 10 of the [[Deixonne Law]] (''Loi Deixonne'') on the teaching of local languages and dialects made provision for [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and old [[Provençal (dialect)|Provençal]], but not for [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ([[West Flemish]]) or Alsatian in Alsace and [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]. However, in a Decree of 18 December 1952, supplemented by an Order of 19 December of the same year, optional teaching of the German language was introduced in elementary schools in Communes where the language of habitual use was the Alsatian dialect.

In 1972, the Inspector General of German, Georges Holderith, obtained authorization to reintroduce German into 33 intermediate classes on an experimental basis. This teaching of German, referred to as the Holderith Reform, was later extended to all pupils in the last two years of elementary school. This reform is still largely the basis of German teaching (but not Alsatian) in elementary schools today.

It was not until 9 June 1982, with the ''Circulaire sur la langue et la culture régionales en Alsace'' (Memorandum on regional language and culture in Alsace) issued by the Vice-Chancellor of the Académie Pierre Deyon, that the teaching of German in primary schools in Alsace really began to be given more official status. The Ministerial Memorandum of 21 June 1982, known as the Circulaire Savary, introduced financial support, over three years, for the teaching of regional languages in schools and universities. This memorandum was, however, implemented in a fairly lax manner.

Both Alsatian and Standard German were for a time banned from public life (including street and city names, official administration, and educational system). Though the ban has long been lifted and street signs today are often bilingual, Alsace-Lorraine is today predominantly French in language and culture. Few young people speak Alsatian today, although there do still exist one or two enclaves in the [[Sundgau]] region where some older inhabitants cannot speak French, and where Alsatian is still used as the mother tongue. A related [[Alemannic German]] survives on the opposite bank of the Rhine, in [[Baden]], and especially in Switzerland. However, while French is the major language of the region, the Alsatian dialect of French is heavily influenced by German and other languages such as Yiddish in phonology and vocabulary.

This situation has spurred a movement to preserve the Alsatian language, which is perceived as endangered, a situation paralleled in other ''régions'' of France, such as [[Brittany]] or [[Occitania]]. Alsatian is now taught in French high schools. Increasingly, French is the only language used at home and at work, whereas a growing number of people have a good knowledge of [[standard German]] as a foreign language learned in school.

The constitution of the Fifth Republic states that French alone is the official language of the Republic. However, Alsatian, along with other regional languages, are recognized by the French government in the official list of languages of France.

Although the French government signed the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in 1992, it never ratified the treaty and therefore no legal basis exists for any of the regional languages in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/societe/2015/06/05/31003-20150605ARTFIG00157-charte-europeenne-des-langues-regionales-hollande-nourrit-la-guerre-contre-le-francais.php|title=Charte européenne des langues régionales : Hollande nourrit la guerre contre le français|work=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, visitors to Alsace can see indications of renewed political and cultural interest in the language – in Alsatian signs appearing in car-windows and on hoardings, and in new official bilingual street signs in Strasbourg and Mulhouse.

A 1999 INSEE survey, included in the 1999 Census, the majority of the population in Alsace speak [[French Language|French]] as their first language, 39.0% (or 500,000 people) of the population speak [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]], 16.2% (or 208,000 people) speak [[German Language|German]], 75,200 people speak [[English Language|English]] (or 5.9%) and 27,600 people speak [[Italian Language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=www.epsilon.insee.fr/jspui/bitstream/1/2294/1/cpar12_1.pdf, L'alsacien, deuxième langue régionale de France|publisher=INSEE|date=December 2002|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey counted 548,000 adult speakers of Alsatian in France, making it the second most-spoken regional language in the country (after [[Occitan]]). Like all regional languages in France, however, the transmission of Alsatian is on the decline. While 39% of the adult population of Alsace speak Alsatian, only one in four children speak it, and only one in ten children uses it regularly.

===Architecture===
[[File:Colmar - Alsace.jpg|thumb|[[Colmar]]'s old town]]
The traditional habitat of the Alsatian lowland, like in other regions of Germany and Northern Europe, consists of houses constructed with walls in [[timber framing]] and cob and roofing in flat tiles. This type of construction is abundant in adjacent parts of Germany and can be seen in other areas of France, but their particular abundance in Alsace is owed to several reasons:
# The proximity to the [[Vosges]] where the wood can be found.
# During periods of war and bubonic plague, villages were often burned down, so to prevent the collapse of the upper floors, ground floors were built of stone and upper floors built in half-timberings to prevent the spread of fire.
# During most of the part of its history, a great part of Alsace was flooded by the Rhine every year. Half-timbered houses were easy to knock down and to move around during those times (a day was necessary to move it and a day to rebuild it in another place).

However, half-timbering was found to increase the risk of fire, which is why from the 19th century, it began to be rendered. In recent times, villagers started to paint the rendering white in accordance with Beaux-Arts movements. To discourage this, the region's authorities gave financial grants to the inhabitants to paint the rendering in various colours, in order to return to the original style and many inhabitants accepted (more for financial reasons than by firm belief).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Cuisine===
[[File:Tarte flambée alsacienne 514471722.jpg|thumb|''[[Flammekueche]]'']]
[[Alsatian cuisine]], somewhat based on German culinary traditions, is marked by the use of pork in various forms. It is perhaps mostly known for the region's wines and beers. Traditional dishes include ''[[baeckeoffe]]'', ''[[tarte flambée|flammekueche]]'', ''[[choucroute garnie|choucroute]]'', and ''[[fleischnacka]]''. Southern Alsace, also called the [[Sundgau]], is characterized by ''[[carp|carpe frite]]'' (that also exists in [[Yiddish]] tradition).

====Food====
[[File:Kouglof.png|thumb|[[Kugelhupf]]]]
The festivities of the year's end involve the production of a great variety of biscuits and small cakes called ''[[bredela]]'' as well as ''[[pain d'épices]]'' ([[gingerbread]] cakes) which are baked around Christmas time. The [[Kugelhupf]] is also popular in Alsace, and the [[Christstollen]] during the Christmas season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Les Christstollen de la vallée de Munster|year=2009|url=http://sitemap.dna.fr/articles/200912/21/les-christstollen-de-la-vallee-de-munster,region,000011851.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gastronomic symbol of the ''région'' is undoubtedly the [[Choucroute]], a local variety of [[Sauerkraut]]. The word Sauerkraut in Alsatian has the form ''sûrkrût'', same as in other southwestern German dialects, and means &quot;sour cabbage&quot; as its [[German language|Standard German]] equivalent. This word was included into the French language as ''choucroute''. To make it, the cabbage is finely shredded, layered with salt and [[juniper]] and left to ferment in wooden barrels. Sauerkraut can be served with poultry, pork, sausage or even fish. Traditionally it is served with Strasbourg sausage or frankfurters, bacon, smoked pork or smoked [[Morteau Sausage|Morteau]] or [[Montbéliard]] sausages, or a selection of other pork products. Served alongside are often roasted or steamed potatoes or dumplings.

Alsace is also well known for its [[foie gras]] made in the region since the 17th century. Additionally, Alsace is known for its fruit juices and mineral waters.

====Wines====
[[File:Riesling grapes leaves.jpg|thumb|right|Riesling Grapes]]
Alsace is an important [[list of wine-producing regions|wine-producing ''région'']]. ''Vins d'Alsace'' ([[Alsace wine]]s) are mostly white. Alsace produces some of the world's most noted dry [[riesling]]s and is the only region in France to produce mostly [[varietal]] wines identified by the names of the grapes used (wine from [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] is also mainly varietal, but not normally identified as such), typically from grapes also used in Germany. The most notable example is [[Gewurztraminer]].

====Beers====
Alsace is also the main beer-producing region of France, thanks primarily to [[brewery|breweries]] in and near [[Strasbourg]]. These include those of [[Fischer Brewery|Fischer]], [[Karlsbräu]], [[Kronenbourg]], and [[Heineken International]]. [[Hops]] are grown in [[Kochersberg]] and in northern Alsace. [[Schnapps]] is also traditionally made in Alsace, but it is in decline because home [[distillation|distillers]] are becoming less common and the consumption of traditional, strong, alcoholic beverages is decreasing.

===In tales===
[[File:Cegonha alsaciana.jpg|thumb|Alsatian stork]]

The [[stork]] is a main feature of Alsace and was the subject of many [[legend]]s told to children. The bird practically disappeared around 1970, but re-population efforts are continuing. They are mostly found on roofs of houses, churches and other public buildings in Alsace.

The [[Easter Bunny]] was first mentioned in [[Georg Franck von Franckenau]]'s ''De ovis paschalibus'' (About Easter eggs) in 1682 referring to an Alsace tradition of an Easter Hare bringing Easter eggs.

===The term &quot;Alsatia&quot;===
{{main|Alsatia}}

&quot;Alsatia&quot;, the Latin form of Alsace's name, entered the [[English language]] as &quot;a lawless place&quot; or &quot;a place under no jurisdiction&quot; prior to the 17th century as a reflection of the British perception of the region at that time. It was used into the 20th century as a term for a ramshackle marketplace, &quot;protected by ancient custom and the independence of their patrons&quot;. The word is still in use in the 21st century among the English and Australian judiciaries to describe a place where the law cannot reach: &quot;In setting up the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]], the state has set out to create an Alsatia - a region of executive action free of judicial oversight,&quot; [[Lord Justice Sedley]] in UMBS v SOCA 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article2586539.ece|title=Law Lords slam crime agency for freezing UMBS payments|newspaper=The Independent|date=27 May 2007|accessdate=2010-05-30|location=London|first=Paul|last=Lashmar|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001051829/http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article2586539.ece|archivedate=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derived from the above, &quot;[[Alsatia]]&quot; was historically a [[Cant (language)|cant]] term for the area near [[Whitefriars, London]], which was for a long time a [[sanctuary]]. It is first known in print in the title of ''[[The Squire of Alsatia]]'', a 1688 play written by [[Thomas Shadwell]].

==Economy==
According to the ''Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques'' ([[INSEE]]), Alsace had a gross domestic product of 44.3&amp;nbsp;billion euros in 2002. With a GDP per capita of €24,804, it was the second-place ''région'' of France, losing only to [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]]. 68% of its jobs are in the [[Service Sector|services]]; 25% are in industry, making Alsace one of France's most industrialised ''régions''.

Alsace is a ''région'' of varied economic activity, including:
* [[viticulture]] (mostly along the ''[[Route des Vins d'Alsace]]'' between [[Marlenheim]] and [[Thann, Haut-Rhin|Thann]])
* [[hops|hop]] harvesting and brewing (half of French beer is produced in Alsace, especially in the vicinity of Strasbourg, notably in [[Kronenbourg|Strasbourg-Cronenbourg]], [[Schiltigheim]] and [[Obernai]])
* forestry development
* automobile industry ([[Mulhouse]] and [[Molsheim]], home town of [[Bugatti]] Automobiles) 
* [[life science]]s, as part of the trinational [[BioValley (Europe)|BioValley]] and
* tourism
* [[potassium chloride]] (until the late 20th century) and [[potash]] mining

Alsace has many international ties and 35% of firms are foreign companies (notably German, Swiss, American, Japanese, and [[Scandinavia]]n).

===Tourism===
Having been early and always densely populated, Alsace is famous for its high number of picturesque villages, churches and castles and for the various beauties of its three main towns, in spite of severe destructions suffered throughout five centuries of wars between France and Germany.

Alsace is furthermore famous for its vineyards (especially along the 170&amp;nbsp;km of the ''[[Route des Vins d'Alsace]]'' from [[Marlenheim]] to [[Thann, Haut-Rhin|Thann]]) and the [[Vosges mountains]] with their thick and green forests and picturesque lakes.

===Transportation===

====Roads====
[[File:Absolute ponts couverts 02.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ponts Couverts (Strasbourg)|Ponts Couverts]], [[Strasbourg]]]]

Most major car journeys are made on the [[A35 autoroute]], which links Saint-Louis on the Swiss border to Lauterbourg on the German border.

The [[A4 autoroute|A4]] toll road (towards Paris) begins 20&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Strasbourg]] and the [[A36 autoroute|A36]] toll road towards Lyon, begins 10&amp;nbsp;km west from [[Mulhouse]].

Spaghetti-junctions (built in the 1970s and 1980s) are prominent in the comprehensive system of motorways in Alsace, especially in the outlying areas of Strasbourg and Mulhouse. These cause a major buildup of traffic and are the main sources of pollution in the towns, notably in Strasbourg where the motorway traffic of the A35 was 170,000 per day in 2002.

At present, plans are being considered for building a new [[dual carriageway]] west of Strasbourg, which would reduce the buildup of traffic in that area by picking up north and southbound vehicles and getting rid of the buildup outside Strasbourg. The line plans to link up the interchange of [[Hœrdt]] to the north of Strasbourg, with [[Innenheim]] in the southwest. The opening is envisaged at the end of 2011, with an average usage of 41,000 vehicles a day. Estimates of the French Works Commissioner however, raised some doubts over the interest of such a project, since it would pick up only about 10% of the traffic of the A35 at Strasbourg. Paradoxically, this reversed the situation of the 1950s. At that time, the French trunk road left of the Rhine not been built, so that traffic would cross into Germany to use the Karlsruhe-Basel Autobahn.

To add to the buildup of traffic, the neighbouring German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] has imposed a tax on heavy-goods vehicles using their [[Autobahn]]en. Thus, a proportion of the HGVs travelling from north Germany to Switzerland or southern Alsace bypasses the [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] on the Alsace-Baden-Württemberg border and uses the untolled, French [[A35 autoroute|A35]] instead.

====Trains====
[[File:Place de l Homme de Fer.jpg|thumb|right|Place de l'Homme de Fer Tram Station]]

[[TER Alsace]] is the rail network serving Alsace. Its network is articulated around the city of Strasbourg. It is one of the most developed rail networks in France, financially sustained partly by the French railroad [[SNCF]], and partly by the ''région'' Alsace.

Because the Vosges are surmountable only by the [[Col de Saverne]] and the [[Belfort]] Gap, it has been suggested that Alsace needs to open up and get closer to France in terms of its rail links. Developments already under way or planned include:
* the [[LGV Est|TGV Est]] (Paris – Strasbourg) had its first phase brought into service in June 2007, bringing down the Strasbourg-Paris trip from 4 to 2 hours 20 minutes, and further reducing it to 1h 50m after the completion of the second phase in 2016.
* the [[LGV Rhin-Rhône|TGV Rhin-Rhône]] between [[Dijon]] and Mulhouse (opened in 2011)
* a tram-train system in Mulhouse (2011)
* an interconnection with the German [[InterCityExpress]], as far as [[Kehl]] (expected 2016)

However, the abandoned Maurice-Lemaire tunnel towards [[Saint-Dié-des-Vosges]] was rebuilt as a toll road.

====Waterways====
Port traffic of Alsace exceeds 15&amp;nbsp;million tonnes, of which about three-quarters is centred on Strasbourg, which is the second busiest French fluvial harbour. The enlargement plan of the [[Rhône–Rhine Canal]], intended to link up the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and Central Europe (Rhine, [[Danube]], [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]]) was abandoned in 1998 for reasons of expense and land erosion, notably in the Doubs valley.

====Air traffic====
There are two [[international airport]]s in Alsace:
* the international airport of Strasbourg in [[Entzheim]]
* the international [[EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg]], which is the seventh largest French airport in terms of traffic

Strasbourg is also two hours away by road from one of the largest European airports, Frankfurt Main, and 2-hour 30 minutes from [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] through the direct [[TGV]] service, stopping in Terminal 2.

====Cycling network====
Crossed by three [[EuroVelo]] routes
* the EuroVelo 5 ([[Via Francigena]] from London to Rome/[[Brindisi]]),
* the EuroVelo 6 (Véloroute des fleuves from [[Nantes]] to [[Budapest]] (H)) and
* the EuroVelo 15 (Véloroute Rhin / Rhine cycle route from [[Andermatt]] (CH) to [[Rotterdam]] (NL)).
Alsace is the most well equipped region of France, with 2000 kilometres of cycle routes. The network is of a very good standard and well signposted. All the towpaths of the canals in Alsace ([[canal des houillères de la Sarre]], [[canal de la Marne au Rhin]], [[canal de la Bruche]], [[canal du Rhône au Rhin]]) are tarred.

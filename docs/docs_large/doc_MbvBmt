{{refimprove |date=October 2013}}
A '''schematic''', or '''schematic diagram''', is a representation of the elements of a [[system]] using abstract, graphic [[symbol]]s rather than realistic pictures. A schematic usually omits all details that are not relevant to the key information the schematic is intended to convey, and may include oversimplified elements in order to make this essential meaning easier to grasp.

For example, a subway map intended for passengers may represent a subway station with a dot. The dot is not intended to resemble the actual station at all but aims to give the viewer information  without unnecessary visual clutter.

A schematic diagram of a chemical process uses symbols in place of detailed representations of the vessels, piping, valves, pumps, and other equipment that compose the system, thus emphasizing the functions of the individual elements and the interconnections among them and suppresses their particular physical details. In an electronic [[circuit diagram]], the layout of the symbols may not look anything like the circuit as it appears in the physical world: instead of representing the way the circuit ''looks'', the schematic aims to capture, on a more general level, the way it ''works''.

A '''semi-schematic''' diagram combines some of the abstraction of a purely schematic diagram with other elements displayed as realistically as possible, for various reasons. It is a compromise between a purely abstract diagram (e.g. the schematic of the Washington Metro) and an exclusively realistic representation (e.g. the corresponding aerial view of Washington).

[[File:Part of Tabula Peutingeriana.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A semi-schematic map: [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]. While roads and features appear as abstract representations without resemblance to reality, their locations, orientations, and distances are as accurate as possible to make the map practical.]]

==Electrical and electronic industry==
{{Main|Circuit diagram}}

In electrical and electronic industry, a schematic diagram is often used to describe the design of equipment. Schematic diagrams are often used for the maintenance and repair of electronic and electromechanical systems.&lt;ref name=FV75&gt;Thomas E. French, Charles J. Vierck (1975). ''Engineering Drawing and Graphic Technology, Eleventh Edition''. McGraw Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-022157-X}}.  pp. 621–624.&lt;/ref&gt; Original schematics were done by hand, using standardized templates or pre-printed adhesive symbols,  but today [[electronic design automation]] software (EDA or &quot;electrical CAD&quot;) is often used.

In electronic design automation, until the 1980s schematics were virtually the only formal representation for circuits. More recently, with the progress of computer technology, other representations were introduced and specialized [[computer language]]s were developed, since with the explosive growth of the complexity of electronic circuits, traditional schematics are becoming less practical. For example, [[hardware description language]]s are indispensable for modern [[digital circuit]] design.

Schematics for electronic circuits are prepared by designers using EDA ([[electronic design automation]]) tools called [[schematic capture]] tools or [[schematic entry]] tools. These tools go beyond simple drawing of devices and connections. Usually they are integrated into the whole design flow and linked to other EDA tools for verification and simulation of the circuit under design.

In electric power systems design, a schematic drawing called a [[one-line diagram|''one-line'' ''diagram'']] is frequently used to represent [[Electrical substation|substations]], distribution systems or even whole electrical power grids. These diagrams simplify and compress the details that would be repeated on each phase of a [[three-phase]] system, showing only one element instead of three. Electrical diagrams for switchgear often have common device functions designate by [[ANSI Device Numbers|standard function numbers]]. Another type of diagram used for power systems is a ''three-line diagram''.

For analysis purposes of a power system, from the one-line diagram, if the system is balanced, an ''equivalent per-phase'' (or ''single-phase'') ''schematic diagram'' can be obtained. If all of the parameters are represented as impedances and voltage sources, the equivalent per-phase schematic diagram is called an ''impedance diagram''. If all of the parameters are represented as admittances and current sources, the equivalent per-phase schematic diagram is called an ''admittance diagram''.

If the power system is unbalanced, but it is [[Linear system|linear]] (or can be approximated by a linear system), then Fortescue's theorem ([[symmetrical components]]) can be applied. In this way, from the one-line diagram, three different per-phase schematic diagrams are obtained, known as ''sequence diagrams'': ''positive sequence diagram'', ''negative sequence diagram'', and ''zero sequence diagram''. Each of these diagrams can be represented as an impedance diagram or as an admittance diagram.

==Schematics in repair manuals==

Schematic diagrams are used extensively in repair manuals to help users understand the interconnections of parts, and to provide graphical instruction to assist in dismantling and rebuilding mechanical assemblies.  Many automotive and motorcycle [[Repairing|repair]] manuals devote a significant number of pages to schematic diagrams.

{{Other uses}}
In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''scrambler''' is a device that transposes or inverts signals or otherwise encodes a [[message]] at the sender's side to make the message unintelligible at a receiver not equipped with an appropriately set descrambling device. Whereas [[encryption]] usually refers to operations carried out in the [[Digital data|digital]] domain, scrambling usually refers to operations carried out in the [[Analog transmission|analog]] domain. Scrambling is accomplished by the addition of components to the original signal or the changing of some important component of the original signal in order to make extraction of the original signal difficult. Examples of the latter might include removing or changing vertical or horizontal sync pulses in television signals; televisions will not be able to display a picture from such a signal.  Some modern scramblers are actually [[encryption]] devices, the name remaining due to the similarities in use, as opposed to internal operation.

In [[telecommunications]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], a ''scrambler'' (also referred to as a ''randomizer'') is a device that manipulates a data stream before transmitting. The manipulations are reversed by a ''descrambler'' at the receiving side. Scrambling is widely used in [[satellite communications|satellite]], [[Microwave radio relay|radio relay]] communications and [[PSTN]] modems. A scrambler can be placed just before a [[Forward error correction|FEC]] coder, or it can be placed after the FEC, just before the  modulation or [[line code]]. A scrambler in this context has nothing to do with [[encryption|encrypting]], as the intent is not to render the message unintelligible, but to give the transmitted data useful engineering properties.

A scrambler replaces sequences (referred to as ''whitening sequences'') into other sequences without removing undesirable sequences, and as a result it changes the probability of occurrence of vexatious sequences. Clearly it is not foolproof as there are input sequences that yield all-zeros, all-ones, or other undesirable periodic output sequences. A scrambler is therefore not a good substitute for a [[line code]], which, through a coding step, removes unwanted sequences.

== Purposes of scrambling ==
A scrambler (or randomizer) can be either:
# An algorithm that converts an input string into a seemingly [[random]] output string of the same length (e.g., by [[pseudo-random]]ly selecting bits to invert), thus avoiding long sequences of bits of the same value; in this context, a randomizer is also referred to as a scrambler.
# An analog or digital source of unpredictable (i.e., high entropy), unbiased, and usually independent (i.e., random) output bits. A &quot;truly&quot; random generator may be used to feed a (more practical) [[deterministic]] [[pseudo-random]] [[random number generator]], which extends the [[random seed]] value.&lt;!--note: the MIL reference is *very* unclear on that point; does it refer to &quot;true&quot; randomness, statistical randomness, or cryptographically secure randomness?--&gt;

There are two main reasons why scrambling is used:

* To enable accurate timing recovery on receiver equipment without resorting to redundant line coding.  It facilitates the work of a [[timing recovery circuit]] (see also [[Clock recovery]]), an [[automatic gain control]] and other adaptive circuits of the receiver (eliminating long sequences consisting of '0' or '1' only).
* For energy dispersal on the carrier, reducing inter-carrier signal [[interference (communication)|interference]].  It eliminates the dependence of a signal's [[power spectrum]] upon the actual transmitted data, making it more dispersed to meet maximum power spectral density requirements (because if the power is concentrated in a narrow frequency band, it can interfere with adjacent channels due to the [[intermodulation]] (also known as cross-modulation) caused by non-linearities of the receiving tract).

Scramblers are essential components of [[physical layer]] system standards besides [[forward error correction#Interleaving|interleaved coding]] and [[modulation]]. They are usually defined based on [[linear feedback shift register]]s (LFSRs) due to their good statistical properties and ease of implementation in hardware.

It is common for physical layer standards bodies to refer to lower-layer (physical layer and [[link layer]]) encryption as scrambling as well.&lt;ref&gt;EN 301 192, ''Specifications for Data Broadcasting'', [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI), 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ETR 289, ''Support for use of scrambling and Conditional Access (CA) within digital broadcast systems'', [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI), 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This may well be because (traditional) mechanisms employed are based on feedback shift registers as well.
Some standards for [[digital television]], such as [[Conditional access|DVB-CA]] and [[Multiprotocol encapsulation|MPE]], refer to encryption at the link layer as scrambling.

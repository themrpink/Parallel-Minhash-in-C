In a second model the communication is still performed with classical bits, but the parties are allowed to manipulate an unlimited supply of quantum entangled states as part of their protocols. By doing measurements on their entangled states, the parties can save on classical communication during a distributed computation.

The third model involves access to previously shared entanglement in addition to [[qubit]] communication, and is the least explored of the three quantum models.

== Nondeterministic communication complexity ==

In nondeterministic communication complexity, Alice and Bob have access to an oracle.  After receiving the oracle's word, the parties communicate to deduce &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.  The nondeterministic communication complexity is then the maximum over all pairs &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; over the sum of number of bits exchanged and the coding length of the oracle word.

Viewed differently, this amounts to covering all 1-entries of the 0/1-matrix by combinatorial 1-rectangles (i.e., non-contiguous, non-convex submatrices, whose entries are all one (see Kushilevitz and Nisan or Dietzfelbinger et al.)).  The nondeterministic communication complexity is the binary logarithm of the ''rectangle covering number'' of the matrix: the minimum number of combinatorial 1-rectangles required to cover all 1-entries of the matrix, without covering any 0-entries.

Nondeterministic communication complexity occurs as a means to obtaining lower bounds for deterministic communication complexity (see Dietzfelbinger et al.), but also in the theory of nonnegative matrices, where it gives a lower bound on the [[Nonnegative rank (linear algebra)|nonnegative rank]] of a nonnegative matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Yannakakis, M. |title=Expressing combinatorial optimization problems by linear programs|journal=J. Comput. Syst. Sci.|volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=441–466 |year=1991 |doi=10.1016/0022-0000(91)90024-y|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unbounded-error communication complexity ==

In the unbounded-error setting, Alice and Bob have access to a private coin and their own inputs &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. In this setting, Alice succeeds if she responds with the correct value of &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; with probability strictly greater than 1/2. In other words, if Alice's responses have ''any'' non-zero correlation to the true value of &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;, then the protocol is considered valid.

Note that the requirement that the coin is ''private'' is essential. In particular, if the number of public bits shared between Alice and Bob are not counted against the communication complexity, it is easy to argue that computing any function has &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; communication complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lovett|first=Shachar|title=CSE 291: Communication Complexity, Winter 2019 Unbounded-error protocols|url=https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi19/cse291-b/4-unbounded.pdf|access-date=June 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, both models are equivalent if the number of public bits used by Alice and Bob is counted against the protocol's total communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Göös|first1=Mika|last2=Pitassi|first2=Toniann|last3=Watson|first3=Thomas|date=2018-06-01|title=The Landscape of Communication Complexity Classes|journal=Computational Complexity|volume=27|issue=2|pages=245–304|doi=10.1007/s00037-018-0166-6|s2cid=4333231|issn=1420-8954|url=https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2016/6199/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though subtle, lower bounds on this model are extremely strong. More specifically, it is clear that any bound on problems of this class immediately imply equivalent bounds on problems in the deterministic model and the private and public coin models, but such bounds also hold immediately for nondeterministic communication models and quantum communication models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherstov|first=Alexander A.|date=October 2008|title=The Unbounded-Error Communication Complexity of Symmetric Functions|journal=2008 49th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|pages=384–393|doi=10.1109/focs.2008.20|isbn=978-0-7695-3436-7|s2cid=9072527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open problems ==

Considering a 0 or 1 input matrix &lt;math&gt;M_f=[f(x,y)]_{x,y\in \{0,1\}^n}&lt;/math&gt;, the minimum number of bits exchanged to compute &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; deterministically in the worst case, &lt;math&gt;D(f)&lt;/math&gt;, is known to be bounded from below by the logarithm of the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt;M_f&lt;/math&gt;. The log rank conjecture proposes that the communication complexity, &lt;math&gt;D(f)&lt;/math&gt;, is bounded from above by a constant power of the logarithm of the rank of &lt;math&gt;M_f&lt;/math&gt;. Since D(f) is bounded from above and below by polynomials of log rank&lt;math&gt;(M_f)&lt;/math&gt;, we can say D(f) is polynomially related to log rank&lt;math&gt;(M_f)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the rank of a matrix is polynomial time computable in the size of the matrix, such an upper bound would allow the matrix's communication complexity to be approximated in polynomial time. Note, however, that the size of the matrix itself is exponential in the size of the input.

For a randomized protocol, the number of bits exchanged in the worst case, R(f), is conjectured to be polynomially related to the following formula:

: &lt;math&gt;\log \min(\textrm{rank}(M'_f): M'_f\in \mathbb{R}^{2^n\times 2^n}, (M_f - M'_f)_\infty\leq 1/3).&lt;/math&gt;

Such log rank conjectures are valuable because they reduce the question of a matrix's communication complexity to a question of linearly independent rows (columns) of the matrix. This reveals that the essence of the communication complexity problem, for example in the EQ case above, is figuring out where in the matrix the inputs are, in order to find out if they're equivalent.

== Applications ==
Lower bounds in communication complexity can be used to prove lower bounds in [[decision tree complexity]], [[VLSI circuit]]s, data structures, [[streaming algorithms]], [[space–time tradeoff]]s for Turing machines and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

'''Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen''' (29 July 1841 – 12 February 1912) was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] physician, remembered for his identification of the [[Bacteria|bacterium]] ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]'' in 1873 as the causative agent of [[leprosy]].&lt;ref name=Hansen_1874&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hansen GHA | title = Undersøgelser Angående Spedalskhedens Årsager (Investigations concerning the etiology of leprosy) | journal = Norsk Mag.

== Life ==
Hansen was born in [[Bergen]], Norway and attended the [[Bergen Cathedral School]]. He worked at [[Rikshospitalet]] in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo) and as a doctor in [[Lofoten]]. In 1868 Hansen returned to Bergen to study leprosy while working at Lungegård Hospital (''Lungegårdshospitalet'') with [[Daniel Cornelius Danielssen]], a noted expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/0003-9985%282000%29124%3C0496%3ATLOAH%3E2.0.CO%3B2?code=coap-site  |title=The Legacy of Armauer Hansen|publisher =   Arch Pathol Lab Med—Vol 124, April 2000
|author=  Venita Jay|accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leprosy was regarded as largely [[hereditary]] or otherwise [[miasma theory of disease|miasmic]] in origin. Hansen concluded on the basis of [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies that leprosy was a specific [[disease]] with a specific cause.&lt;ref name=Irgens_1984&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000372-198408000-00008 |author=Irgens L |last2=Rabson |first2=S. M. |title=The discovery of Mycobacterium leprae. A medical achievement in the light of evolving [[scientific method]]s |journal=Am J Dermatopathol |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=337–43 |year=1984 |pmid=6388392}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870–71 Hansen travelled to [[Bonn]] and [[Vienna]] to gain the training necessary for him to prove his [[hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/596.html | title=Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen | work=whonamedit.com | accessdate=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, he announced the discovery of ''Mycobacterium leprae'' in the tissues of all sufferers, although he did not identify them as bacteria, and received little support.&lt;ref name=Hansen /&gt; The discovery was made with a &quot;new and better&quot; microscope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Bergenseren-som-loste-lepra-gaten-6992716.html Bergenseren som løste lepra-gåten] Aaftenposten . 16 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879 Hansen gave tissue samples to [[Albert Neisser]], who then successfully [[Staining|stained]] the bacteria and announced his findings in 1880, claiming to have discovered the disease-causing organism. There was some dispute between Neisser and Hansen, Hansen as discoverer of the bacillus and Neisser as identifier of it as the [[etiology|etiological]] agent. Neisser tried to downplay the assistance of Hansen. Hansen's claim was weakened by his failure to produce a pure [[microbiological culture]] in an artificial medium, or to prove that the [[Bacillus (shape)|rod-shaped]] organisms were infectious. Further Hansen had attempted to infect at least one female patient without consent and although no damage was caused, that case ended in court and Hansen lost his post at the [[hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://nbl.snl.no/Gerhard_Armauer_Hansen|title=  Gerhard Armauer Hansen, Lege|publisher =    Norsk biografisk leksikon
|author=    Ole Didrik Lærum|accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansen remained medical officer for leprosy in Norway and it was through his efforts that the leprosy acts of 1877 and 1885 were passed, leading to a steady decline of the disease in Norway from 1,800 known cases in 1875 to just 575 cases in 1901.

Hansen had suffered from [[syphilis]] since the 1860s but died of [[cardiovascular disease|heart disease]]. He was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/596.html Biography of Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen] ''whonamedit.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japi.org/march_2015/044_gerhard.pdf Gerhard Armauer Hansen (1814-1912)] Journal of the Association of Physicians of India, vol 63, March, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[Bishopric of Utrecht]] was established in 695 when Saint [[Willibrord]] was consecrated bishop of the [[Frisians]] at [[Rome]] by [[Pope Sergius I]]. With the consent of the [[Franks|Frankish]] ruler, [[Pippin of Herstal]], he settled in an old [[Castellum|Roman fort]] in [[Utrecht]]. After Willibrord's death the diocese suffered greatly from the incursions of the [[Vikings]]. Better times appeared during the reign of the [[Ottonian dynasty|Saxon emperors]], who frequently summoned the Bishops of Utrecht to attend the imperial councils and [[diet (assembly)|diet]]s. In 1024 the bishops were made Princes of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the new Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht was formed. In 1122, with the [[Concordat of Worms]], the Emperor's right of investiture was annulled, and the cathedral chapter received the right to elect the bishop. It was, however, soon obligated to share this right with the four other collegiate chapters in the city. The Counts of [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[Guelders]], between whose territories the lands of the Bishops of Utrecht lay, also sought to acquire influence over the filling of the episcopal see. This often led to disputes and consequently the [[Holy See]] frequently interfered in the election. After the middle of the 14th century the popes repeatedly appointed the bishop directly without regard to the five chapters.

During the [[Hook and Cod Wars]], Utrecht was fought over by forces of the [[Duke of Burgundy]] leading to the [[First Utrecht Civil War]] (1470-1474) and [[Second Utrecht Civil War]] (1481-1483).

In 1527, the Bishop sold his territories, and thus his secular authority, to Holy Roman Emperor [[Emperor Charles V|Charles V]] and the principality became an integral part of the [[Habsburg]] dominions, which already included most other Dutch provinces. The chapters transferred their right of electing the bishop to Charles V and his government, a measure to which [[Pope Clement VII]] gave his consent, under political pressure after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]]. However, the Habsburg rule did not last long, as Utrecht joined in the [[Dutch Revolt]] against Charles' successor [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in 1579, becoming a part of the [[Dutch Republic]].

In [[World War II]], Utrecht was held by German forces until the general capitulation of the Germans in the Netherlands on May 5, 1945. It was occupied by Canadian Allied forces on May 7, 1945. The towns of [[Oudewater]], [[Woerden]], [[Vianen]] and [[Leerdam]] were transferred from the province of [[South Holland]] to Utrecht in 1970, 1989, 2002 and 2019 respectively. In February 2011, Utrecht, together with the provinces of [[North Holland]] and [[Flevoland]], showed a desire to investigate the feasibility of a merger between the three provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/216649-drie-provincies-denken-over-fusie.html|title=Drie provincies denken over fusie|author=|date=|website=nos.nl|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been positively received by the [[First Rutte cabinet|Dutch cabinet]], for the desire to create one [[Randstad|Randstad province]] has already been mentioned in the [[coalition agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Randstadprovincies bekijken fusie |url=https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/artikel/3130831/randstadprovincies-bekijken-fusie |website=rtlnieuws |accessdate=12 January 2019|date=2011-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The province of South Holland, part of the Randstad urban area, visioned to be part of the Randstad province,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2011/02/04/randstadprovincies-onderzoeken-fusie-a1460453|title=Randstadprovincies onderzoeken fusie|author=|date=|website=nrc.nl|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and very much supportive of the idea of a merger into one province,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zuid-holland.nl/contentpagina.htm?id=74163 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724173855/http://www.zuid-holland.nl/contentpagina.htm?id=74163 |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is not named.

== Geography ==
[[File:Prov-Utrecht-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|Map of the province of Utrecht (2019)]]

In the east of Utrecht lies the [[Utrecht Hill Ridge]] (Dutch: Utrechtse Heuvelrug), a chain of hills left as [[lateral moraine]] by tongues of glacial ice after the Saline glaciation that preceded the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]]. Because of the scarcity of nutrients in the fast-draining sandy soil, the greatest part of a landscape that was formerly [[heath (habitat)|heath]] has been planted with [[pine]] [[plantation]]s. The south of the province is a river landscape. The west consists mostly of meadows. In the north are big lakes formed by the digging of [[peat]] from bogs formed after the last ice age.

=== Nature ===

One of the most attractive natural areas in the province is the [[Vechtstreek]] (&quot;Vecht region&quot;), situated on either side of the [[Vecht (Utrecht)|Vecht]] river.

An international nature conservation organisation that has settled the head office of its Netherlands branch in this province (at Zeist) is the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]].

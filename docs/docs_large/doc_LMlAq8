: &lt;math&gt;R[t] = \left\{ a_n t^n + a_{n-1} t^{n -1} + \dots + a_1 t + a_0  \mid n \ge 0, a_j \in R \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

forms a commutative ring with the usual addition and multiplication, containing ''R'' as a subring. It is called the [[polynomial ring]] over ''R''. More generally, the set &lt;math&gt;R\left[t_1, \ldots, t_n\right]&lt;/math&gt; of all polynomials in variables &lt;math&gt;t_1, \ldots, t_n&lt;/math&gt; forms a commutative ring, containing &lt;math&gt;R\left[t_i\right]&lt;/math&gt; as subrings.

If ''R'' is an [[integral domain]], then &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is also an integral domain; its field of fractions is the field of [[rational function]]s. If ''R'' is a Noetherian ring, then &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a Noetherian ring. If ''R'' is a unique factorization domain, then &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a unique factorization domain. Finally, ''R'' is a field if and only if &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a principal ideal domain.

Let &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq S&lt;/math&gt; be commutative rings. Given an element ''x'' of ''S'', one can consider the ring homomorphism
: &lt;math&gt;R[t] \to S, \quad f \mapsto f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

(that is, the [[substitution (algebra)|substitution]]). If ''S'' = ''R''[''t''] and ''x'' = ''t'', then ''f''(''t'') = ''f''. Because of this, the polynomial ''f'' is often also denoted by &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The image of the map &lt;math&gt;f \mapsto f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt;; it is the same thing as the subring of ''S'' generated by ''R'' and ''x''.

Example: &lt;math&gt;k\left[t^2, t^3\right]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the image of the homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;k[x, y] \to k[t], \, f \mapsto f\left(t^2, t^3\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, it is the subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;k[t]&lt;/math&gt; generated by ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Example: let ''f'' be a polynomial in one variable, that is, an element in a polynomial ring ''R''. Then &lt;math&gt;f(x+h)&lt;/math&gt; is an element in &lt;math&gt;R[h]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x + h) - f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by ''h'' in that ring. The result of substituting zero to ''h'' in &lt;math&gt;(f(x + h) - f(x))/h&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the derivative of ''f'' at ''x''.

The substitution is a special case of the universal property of a polynomial ring. The property states: given a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi: R \to S&lt;/math&gt; and an element ''x'' in ''S'' there exists a unique ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}: R[t] \to S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}(t) = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; restricts to &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobson|1974|loc=Theorem 2.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, choosing a basis, a [[symmetric algebra]] satisfies the universal property and so is a polynomial ring.

To give an example, let ''S'' be the ring of all functions from ''R'' to itself; the addition and the multiplication are those of functions. Let ''x'' be the identity function. Each ''r'' in ''R'' defines a constant function, giving rise to the homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;. The universal property says that this map extends uniquely to
:&lt;math&gt;R[t] \to S, \quad f \mapsto \overline{f}&lt;/math&gt;
(''t'' maps to ''x'') where &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[polynomial function]] defined by ''f''. The resulting map is injective if and only if ''R'' is infinite.

Given a non-constant monic polynomial ''f'' in &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a ring ''S'' containing ''R'' such that ''f'' is a product of linear factors in &lt;math&gt;S[t]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|Algèbre commutative|loc=Ch 5. §1, Lemma 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''k'' be an algebraically closed field. The [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] (theorem of zeros) states that there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the set of all prime ideals in &lt;math&gt;k\left[t_1, \ldots, t_n\right]&lt;/math&gt; and the set of closed subvarieties of &lt;math&gt;k^n&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, many local problems in algebraic geometry may be attacked through the study of the generators of an ideal in a polynomial ring. (cf. [[Gröbner basis]].)

There are some other related constructions. A [[formal power series ring]] &lt;math&gt;R[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt; consists of formal power series
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_0^\infty a_i t^i, \quad a_i \in R&lt;/math&gt;

together with multiplication and addition that mimic those for convergent series. It contains &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; as a subring. A formal power series ring does not have the universal property of a polynomial ring; a series may not converge after a substitution. The important advantage of a formal power series ring over a polynomial ring is that it is [[local ring|local]] (in fact, [[complete ring|complete]]).

=== Matrix ring and endomorphism ring ===
{{Main|Matrix ring|Endomorphism ring}}

Let ''R'' be a ring (not necessarily commutative). The set of all square matrices of size ''n'' with entries in ''R'' forms a ring with the entry-wise addition and the usual matrix multiplication. It is called the [[matrix ring]] and is denoted by M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''). Given a right ''R''-module &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all ''R''-linear maps from ''U'' to itself forms a ring with addition that is of function and multiplication that is of [[composition of functions]]; it is called the endomorphism ring of ''U'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(U)&lt;/math&gt;.

As in linear algebra, a matrix ring may be canonically interpreted as an endomorphism ring: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(R^n) \simeq \operatorname{M}_n(R)&lt;/math&gt;. This is a special case of the following fact: If &lt;math&gt;f: \oplus_1^n U \to \oplus_1^n U&lt;/math&gt; is an ''R''-linear map, then ''f'' may be written as a matrix with entries &lt;math&gt;f_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S = \operatorname{End}_R(U)&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the ring isomorphism:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(\oplus_1^n U) \to \operatorname{M}_n(S), \quad f \mapsto (f_{ij}).&lt;/math&gt;

Any ring homomorphism ''R'' → ''S'' induces {{nowrap|M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') → M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}}; in fact, any ring homomorphism between matrix rings arises in this way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohn matrix&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|2003|loc=4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schur's lemma]] says that if ''U'' is a simple right ''R''-module, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(U)&lt;/math&gt; is a division ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|2002|loc=Ch. XVII. Proposition 1.1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle U = \bigoplus_{i = 1}^r U_i^{\oplus m_i}&lt;/math&gt; is a direct sum of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;-copies of simple ''R''-modules &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(U) \simeq \prod_{i=1}^r \operatorname{M}_{m_i} (\operatorname{End}_R(U_i))&lt;/math&gt;.
The [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]] states any [[semisimple ring]] (cf. below) is of this form.

A ring ''R'' and the matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') over it are [[Morita equivalent]]: the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of right modules of ''R'' is equivalent to the category of right modules over M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohn matrix&quot; /&gt; In particular, two-sided ideals in ''R'' correspond in one-to-one to two-sided ideals in M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').

Examples:
* The automorphisms of the [[projective line over a ring]] are given by [[homography|homographies]] from the 2 x 2 matrix ring.

=== Limits and colimits of rings ===
Let ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be a sequence of rings such that ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a subring of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i''. Then the union (or [[filtered colimit]]) of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ring &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim R_i&lt;/math&gt; defined as follows: it is the disjoint union of all ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s modulo the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;x \sim y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; in ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for sufficiently large ''i''.

Examples of colimits:
* A polynomial ring in infinitely many variables: &lt;math&gt;R[t_1, t_2, \cdots] = \varinjlim R[t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_m].&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[algebraic closure]] of [[finite field]]s of the same characteristic &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbf{F}}_p = \varinjlim \mathbf{F}_{p^m}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The field of [[formal Laurent series]] over a field ''k'': &lt;math&gt;k(\!(t)\!) = \varinjlim t^{-m}k[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt; (it is the field of fractions of the [[formal power series ring]] &lt;math&gt;k[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.)
* The [[function field of an algebraic variety]] over a field ''k'' is &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim k[U]&lt;/math&gt; where the limit runs over all the coordinate rings &lt;math&gt;k[U]&lt;/math&gt; of nonempty open subsets ''U'' (more succinctly it is the [[stalk (mathematics)|stalk]] of the structure sheaf at the [[generic point]].)

Any commutative ring is the colimit of [[finitely generated ring|finitely generated subrings]].&lt;!-- non-commutative case? --&gt;

A [[projective limit]] (or a [[filtered limit]]) of rings is defined as follows. Suppose we're given a family of rings &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, ''i'' running over positive integers, say, and ring homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;R_j \to R_i, j \ge i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;R_i \to R_i&lt;/math&gt; are all the identities and &lt;math&gt;R_k \to R_j \to R_i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;R_k \to R_i&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;k \ge j \ge i&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\varprojlim R_i&lt;/math&gt; is the subring of &lt;math&gt;\prod R_i&lt;/math&gt; consisting of &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; maps to &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;R_j \to R_i, j \ge i&lt;/math&gt;.

For an example of a projective limit, see {{slink||Completion}}.

=== Localization ===
The [[localization of a ring|localization]] generalizes the construction of the [[field of fractions]] of an integral domain to an arbitrary ring and modules. Given a (not necessarily commutative) ring ''R'' and a subset ''S'' of ''R'', there exists a ring &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; together with the ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R \to R\left[S^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt; that &quot;inverts&quot; ''S''; that is, the homomorphism maps elements in ''S'' to unit elements in &lt;math&gt;R\left[S^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt;, and, moreover, any ring homomorphism from ''R'' that &quot;inverts&quot; ''S'' uniquely factors through &lt;math&gt;R\left[S^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|1995|loc=Proposition 1.3.1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ring &lt;math&gt;R\left[S^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''localization''' of ''R'' with respect to ''S''. For example, if ''R'' is a commutative ring and ''f'' an element in ''R'', then the localization &lt;math&gt;R\left[f^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt; consists of elements of the form &lt;math&gt;r/f^n, \, r \in R , \, n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; (to be precise, &lt;math&gt;R\left[f^{-1}\right] = R[t]/(tf - 1).&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|2004|loc=Exercise 2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The localization is frequently applied to a commutative ring ''R'' with respect to the complement of a prime ideal (or a union of prime ideals) in ''R''. In that case &lt;math&gt;S = R - \mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;, one often writes &lt;math&gt;R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;R\left[S^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is then a [[local ring]] with the [[maximal ideal]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;. This is the reason for the terminology &quot;localization&quot;. The field of fractions of an integral domain ''R'' is the localization of ''R'' at the prime ideal zero. If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is a prime ideal of a commutative ring ''R'', then the field of fractions of &lt;math&gt;R/\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the residue field of the local ring &lt;math&gt;R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;k(\mathfrak{p})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- In algebraic geometry, the field of fractions is the localization at the &quot;[[generic point]]&quot; --&gt;

If ''M'' is a left ''R''-module, then the localization of ''M'' with respect to ''S'' is given by a [[change of rings]] &lt;math&gt;M\left[S^{-1}\right] = R\left[S^{-1}\right] \otimes_R M&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- intuitively, M_p corresponds to the fiber over ''p'' in ''M''. In particular, there is the canonical map &lt;math&gt;M \to M\left[S^{-1}\right], \, m \mapsto m / 1&lt;/math&gt;. Its kernel consists of elements ''m'' such that &lt;math&gt;sm = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some ''s'' in ''S''. --&gt;

The most important properties of localization are the following: when ''R'' is a commutative ring and ''S'' a multiplicatively closed subset
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} \mapsto \mathfrak{p}\left[S^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection between the set of all prime ideals in ''R'' disjoint from ''S'' and the set of all prime ideals in &lt;math&gt;R\left[S^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|2012|loc=Proposition 6.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;R\left[S^{-1}\right] = \varinjlim R\left[f^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt;, ''f'' running over elements in ''S'' with partial ordering given by divisibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|2012|loc=The end of Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The localization is exact:
*: &lt;math&gt;0 \to M'\left[S^{-1}\right] \to M\left[S^{-1}\right] \to M''\left[S^{-1}\right] \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact over &lt;math&gt;R\left[S^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact over ''R''.
* Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;0 \to M'_\mathfrak{m} \to M_\mathfrak{m} \to M''_\mathfrak{m} \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact for any maximal ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact.
* A remark: localization is no help in proving a global existence. One instance of this is that if two modules are isomorphic at all prime ideals, it does not follow that they are isomorphic. (One way to explain this is that the localization allows one to view a module as a sheaf over prime ideals and a sheaf is inherently a local notion.)

In [[category theory]], a [[localization of a category]] amounts to making some morphisms isomorphisms. An element in a commutative ring ''R'' may be thought of as an endomorphism of any ''R''-module. Thus, categorically, a localization of ''R'' with respect to a subset ''S'' of ''R'' is a [[functor]] from the category of ''R''-modules to itself that sends elements of ''S'' viewed as endomorphisms to automorphisms and is universal with respect to this property. (Of course, ''R'' then maps to &lt;math&gt;R\left[S^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt; and ''R''-modules map to &lt;math&gt;R\left[S^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt;-modules.)

=== Completion ===
Let ''R'' be a commutative ring, and let ''I'' be an ideal of ''R''.
The '''[[Completion (ring theory)|completion]]''' of ''R'' at ''I'' is the projective limit &lt;math&gt;\hat{R} = \varprojlim R/I^n&lt;/math&gt;; it is a commutative ring. The canonical homomorphisms from ''R'' to the quotients &lt;math&gt;R/I^n&lt;/math&gt; induce a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R \to \hat{R}&lt;/math&gt;. The latter homomorphism is injective if ''R'' is a Noetherian integral domain and ''I'' is a proper ideal, or if ''R'' is a Noetherian local ring with maximal ideal ''I'', by [[Krull's intersection theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah and Macdonald, Theorem 10.17 and its corollaries.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction is especially useful when ''I'' is a maximal ideal.

The basic example is the completion '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of '''Z''' at the principal ideal (''p'') generated by a prime number ''p''; it is called the ring of [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]]. The completion can in this case be constructed also from the [[p-adic absolute value|''p''-adic absolute value]] on '''Q'''. The ''p''-adic absolute value on '''Q''' is a map &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto |x|&lt;/math&gt; from '''Q''' to '''R''' given by &lt;math&gt;|n|_p=p^{-v_p(n)}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;v_p(n)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the exponent of ''p'' in the prime factorization of a nonzero integer ''n'' into prime numbers (we also put &lt;math&gt;|0|_p=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|m/n|_p = |m|_p/|n|_p&lt;/math&gt;). It defines a distance function on '''Q''' and the completion of '''Q''' as a [[metric space]] is denoted by '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is again a field since the field operations extend to the completion. The subring of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; consisting of elements ''x'' with &lt;math&gt;|x|_p \le 1&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Similarly, the formal power series ring &lt;math&gt;R[{[t]}]&lt;/math&gt; is the completion of &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;(t)&lt;/math&gt; (see also [[Hensel's lemma]])&lt;!-- need to be discussed with concrete examples. Start of a para: The notion of the completion formalizes the construction of a solution by successive approximation. --&gt;

A complete ring has much simpler structure than a commutative ring. This owns to the [[Cohen structure theorem]], which says, roughly, that a complete local ring tends to look like a formal power series ring or a quotient of it. On the other hand, the interaction between the [[integral closure]] and completion has been among the most important aspects that distinguish modern commutative ring theory from the classical one developed by the likes of Noether. Pathological examples found by Nagata led to the reexamination of the roles of Noetherian rings and motivated, among other things, the definition of [[excellent ring]].

=== Rings with generators and relations ===
The most general way to construct a ring is by specifying generators and relations. Let ''F'' be a [[free ring]] (that is, free algebra over the integers) with the set ''X'' of symbols, that is, ''F'' consists of polynomials with integral coefficients in noncommuting variables that are elements of ''X''. A free ring satisfies the universal property: any function from the set ''X'' to a ring ''R'' factors through ''F'' so that &lt;math&gt;F \to R&lt;/math&gt; is the unique ring homomorphism. Just as in the group case, every ring can be represented as a quotient of a free ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-4ADgUgpSMC&amp;pg=PA242 pg. 242]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, we can impose relations among symbols in ''X'' by taking a quotient. Explicitly, if ''E'' is a subset of ''F'', then the quotient ring of ''F'' by the ideal generated by ''E'' is called the ring with generators ''X'' and relations ''E''. If we used a ring, say, ''A'' as a base ring instead of '''Z''', then the resulting ring will be over ''A''. For example, if &lt;math&gt;E = \{ xy - yx \mid x, y \in X \}&lt;/math&gt;, then the resulting ring will be the usual polynomial ring with coefficients in ''A'' in variables that are elements of ''X'' (It is also the same thing as the [[symmetric algebra]] over ''A'' with symbols ''X''.)

In the category-theoretic terms, the formation &lt;math&gt;S \mapsto \text{the free ring generated by the set } S&lt;/math&gt; is the left adjoint functor of the [[forgetful functor]] from the [[category of rings]] to '''Set''' (and it is often called the free ring functor.)&lt;!-- Note: we need to discuss a ring as a solution to a universal problem with some specific application. --&gt;

Let ''A'', ''B'' be algebras over a commutative ring ''R''. Then the tensor product of ''R''-modules &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_R B&lt;/math&gt; is a ''R''-module. We can turn it to a ring by extending linearly &lt;math&gt;(x \otimes u) (y \otimes v) = xy \otimes uv&lt;/math&gt;. See also: [[tensor product of algebras]], [[change of rings]].

== Special kinds of rings ==

=== Domains ===
A [[zero ring|nonzero]] ring with no nonzero [[zero-divisor]]s is called a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]. A commutative domain is called an [[integral domain]]. The most important integral domains are principal ideals domains, PID for short, and fields. A principal ideal domain is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal. An important class of integral domains that contain a PID is a [[unique factorization domain]] (UFD), an integral domain in which every nonunit element is a product of [[prime element]]s (an element is prime if it generates a [[prime ideal]].) The fundamental question in [[algebraic number theory]] is on the extent to which the [[ring of integers|ring of (generalized) integers]] in a [[number field]], where an &quot;ideal&quot; admits prime factorization, fails to be a PID.

Among theorems concerning a PID, the most important one is the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]. The theorem may be illustrated by the following application to linear algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|2002|loc=Ch XIV, §2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field ''k'' and &lt;math&gt;f: V \to V&lt;/math&gt; a linear map with minimal polynomial ''q''. Then, since &lt;math&gt;k[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a unique factorization domain, ''q'' factors into powers of distinct irreducible polynomials (that is, prime elements):
:&lt;math&gt;q = p_1^{e_1} \ldots p_s^{e_s}.&lt;/math&gt;

Letting &lt;math&gt;t \cdot v = f(v)&lt;/math&gt;, we make ''V'' a ''k''[''t'']-module. The structure theorem then says ''V'' is a direct sum of [[cyclic module]]s, each of which is isomorphic to the module of the form &lt;math&gt;k[t]/\left(p_i^{k_j}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Now, if &lt;math&gt;p_i(t) = t - \lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;, then such a cyclic module (for &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;) has a basis in which the restriction of ''f'' is represented by a [[Jordan matrix]]. Thus, if, say, ''k'' is algebraically closed, then all &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;'s are of the form &lt;math&gt;t - \lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; and the above decomposition corresponds to the [[Jordan canonical form]] of ''f''.

In algebraic geometry, UFDs arise because of smoothness. More precisely, a point in a variety (over a perfect field) is smooth if the local ring at the point is a [[regular local ring]]. A regular local ring is a UFD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weibel|loc=Ch 1, Theorem 3.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a chain of [[subclass (set theory)|class inclusions]] that describes the relationship between rings, domains and fields:

: '''[[Commutative ring]]s''' ⊃ '''[[integral domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[integrally closed domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[unique factorization domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[principal ideal domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[Euclidean domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[field (mathematics)|fields]]'''

=== Division ring ===
A [[division ring]] is a ring such that every non-zero element is a unit. A commutative division ring is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. A prominent example of a division ring that is not a field is the ring of [[quaternion]]s. Any centralizer in a division ring is also a division ring. In particular, the center of a division ring is a field. It turned out that every ''finite'' domain (in particular finite division ring) is a field; in particular commutative (the [[Wedderburn's little theorem]]).

Every module over a division ring is a free module (has a basis); consequently, much of linear algebra can be carried out over a division ring instead of a field.

The study of conjugacy classes figures prominently in the classical theory of division rings. Cartan famously asked the following question: given a division ring ''D'' and a proper sub-division-ring ''S'' that is not contained in the center, does each inner automorphism of ''D'' restrict to an automorphism of ''S''? The answer is negative: this is the [[Cartan–Brauer–Hua theorem]].&lt;!--
need more context. To give a concrete example, we consider a division ring ''D'' whose center ''k'' is the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt; of ''p''-adic rational numbers (or more generally a nonarchimedean local field).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|CFT|loc=Ch IV, §4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The valuation of ''k'' uniquely extends to any subfield of ''D''. Since ''D'' is a union of subfields, we thus obtain the valuation ''v'' of ''D''. (This has to be verified; it is not a priori obvious that ''v'' is indeed a valuation). Define
:&lt;math&gt;O_D = \{ x \in D | v(x) \ge 0 \}, \quad \mathfrak{P} = \{ x \in D | v(x) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;O_D&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of ''D'' with the unique maximal ideal that is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{P}&lt;/math&gt;. It is called the ring of integers of ''D''.

A [[cyclic algebra]], introduced by [[L. E. Dickson]], is a generalization of a [[quaternion algebra]].

===Architectural theory===
{{further|Mathematics and architecture}}

During the Renaissance, architecture became not only a question of practice, but also a matter for theoretical discussion. [[Printing]] played a large role in the dissemination of ideas.
* The first treatise on architecture was ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' (&quot;On the Subject of Building&quot;) by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in 1450. It was to some degree dependent on [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'', a manuscript of which was discovered in 1414 in a library in Switzerland. ''De re aedificatoria'' in 1485 became the first printed book on architecture.
* [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475 – c. 1554) produced the next important text, the first volume of which appeared in Venice in 1537; it was entitled ''Regole generali d'architettura'' (&quot;General Rules of Architecture&quot;). It is known as Serlio's &quot;Fourth Book&quot; since it was the fourth in Serlio's original plan of a treatise in seven books. In all, five books were published.
* In 1570, [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580) published ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' (&quot;The Four Books of Architecture&quot;) in [[Venice]]. This book was widely printed and responsible to a great degree for spreading the ideas of the Renaissance through Europe. All these books were intended to be read and studied not only by architects, but also by patrons.

==Principal phases==

Historians often divide the Renaissance in Italy into three phases.&lt;ref&gt;Some architectural histories e.g. Sir [[Banister Fletcher]], include Baroque as a phase of Renaissance architecture. Because of its extent, diversity and deviation from the Classical it is not included here and is the subject of a main article.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas art historians might talk of an &quot;Early Renaissance&quot; period, in which they include developments in 14th-century painting and sculpture, this is usually not the case in architectural history. The bleak economic conditions of the late 14th century did not produce buildings that are considered to be part of the Renaissance. As a result, the word &quot;Renaissance&quot; among architectural historians usually applies to the period 1400 to ca. 1525, or later in the case of non-Italian Renaissances.

Historians often use the following designations:
* Renaissance (ca. 1400–1500); also known as the [[Quattrocento]]&lt;ref&gt;The Italian translates literally to &quot;fourteen-hundred&quot; and coincides with the English &quot;fifteenth century&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes Early Renaissance&lt;ref&gt;The ''Early Renaissance'' in architecture is most applicable to developments in Venice, where there was a more fluid development between medieval and Renaissance styles than in Florence. See: John McAndrew ''Venetian Architecture of the Early Renaissance'' (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[High Renaissance]] (ca.1500–1525)
* [[Mannerism]] (ca. 1520–1600)

===Quattrocento===
{{main|Quatrocento}}
In the ''Quattrocento'', concepts of architectural order were explored and rules were formulated. The study of classical antiquity led in particular to the adoption of Classical detail and ornamentation.

Space, as an element of architecture, was utilised differently from the way it had been in the [[Middle Ages]]. Space was organised by proportional logic, its form and rhythm subject to geometry, rather than being created by intuition as in Medieval buildings. The prime example of this is the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|Basilica di San Lorenzo]] in [[Florence]] by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (1377–1446).&lt;ref&gt;Howard Saalman. ''Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings''. (London: Zwemmer, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===High Renaissance===
{{main|High Renaissance}}
During the High Renaissance, concepts derived from classical antiquity were developed and used with greater confidence. The most representative architect is [[Donato Bramante]] (1444–1514), who expanded the applicability of classical architecture to contemporary buildings. His Tempietto di [[San Pietro in Montorio]] (1503) was directly inspired by circular [[Roman temple]]s. He was, however, hardly a slave to the classical forms and it was his style that was to dominate Italian architecture in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldo Bruschi. ''Bramante'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mannerism===
{{main|Mannerism#Mannerist architecture}}
[[File:CampidoglioEng.jpg|thumb|The Piazza del Campidoglio]]
During the [[Mannerist]] period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style was [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564), who frequently used the [[giant order]] in his architecture, a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}{{Citation| title= Pilaster Play| author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal= Thresholds| url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf| volume= 28 (Winter 2005)| pages= 34–41| access-date= 27 December 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121026091320/http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf| archive-date= 26 October 2012| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this in his design for the [[Capitoline Hill#Piazza|Piazza del Campidoglio]] in Rome.

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgemental terms.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Renaissance to Baroque===

{{main|Baroque architecture}}
As the new style of architecture spread out from Italy, most other European countries developed a sort of Proto-Renaissance style, before the construction of fully formulated Renaissance buildings. Each country in turn then grafted its own architectural traditions to the new style, so that Renaissance buildings across Europe are diversified by region.

Within Italy the evolution of Renaissance architecture into Mannerism, with widely diverging tendencies in the work of Michelangelo and Giulio Romano and Andrea Palladio, led to the Baroque style in which the same architectural vocabulary was used for very different rhetoric.

Outside Italy, Baroque architecture was more widespread and fully developed than the Renaissance style, with significant buildings as far afield as [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Cathedral of Chihuahua]], 1725–1826&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Basilica Minore del Santo Niño]], present structure 1735–39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:SaintPierreRaphael.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Raphael's unused plan for St. Peter's Basilica]]
The obvious distinguishing features of Classical Roman architecture were adopted by Renaissance architects. However, the forms and purposes of buildings had changed over time, as had the structure of cities. Among the earliest buildings of the reborn Classicism were churches of a type that the Romans had never constructed. Neither were there models for the type of large city dwellings required by wealthy merchants of the 15th century. Conversely, there was no call for enormous sporting fixtures and public bath houses such as the Romans had built. The ancient orders were analysed and reconstructed to serve new purposes.&lt;ref&gt;The list of characteristics below is expanded from a list based on [[Banister Fletcher]]. See below&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan===

The plans of Renaissance buildings have a square, symmetrical appearance in which proportions are usually based on a module. Within a church, the module is often the width of an aisle. The need to integrate the design of the plan with the façade was introduced as an issue in the work of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], but he was never able to carry this aspect of his work into fruition. The first building to demonstrate this was [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua by [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]. The development of the plan in secular architecture was to take place in the 16th century and culminated with the work of [[Palladio]].
[[File:Sant Agostino Fassade.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Sant'Agostino, Rome]], built in 1483 by Giacomo di Pietrasanta]]

====Façade====
[[Façade]]s are symmetrical around their vertical axis. Church façades are generally surmounted by a [[pediment]] and organised by a system of [[pilaster]]s, arches and [[entablature]]s. The columns and windows show a progression towards the centre. One of the first true Renaissance façades was the [[Pienza Cathedral|Cathedral of Pienza]] (1459–62), which has been attributed to the Florentine architect Bernardo Gambarelli (known as [[Rossellino]]) with [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]] perhaps having some responsibility in its design as well.

Domestic buildings are often surmounted by a [[cornice]]. There is a regular repetition of openings on each floor, and the centrally placed door is marked by a feature such as a balcony, or rusticated surround. An early and much copied prototype was the façade for the [[Palazzo Rucellai]] (1446 and 1451) in Florence with its three registers of [[pilasters]].
[[File:Classical orders from the Encyclopedie.png|thumb|left|Classical Orders, engraving from the ''Encyclopédie vol. 18.'' 18th century.]]

===Columns and pilasters===

Roman and Greek orders of columns are used: [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] and [[Composite order|Composite]]. The orders can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, [[pilaster]]s, and [[entablatures]] as an integrated system. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the [[Sagrestia Vecchia|Old Sacristy]] (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi.

===Arches===

Arches are semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental. Arches are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental scale at the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua.

===Vaults===

Vaults do not have ribs. They are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault which is frequently rectangular. The [[barrel vault]] is returned to architectural vocabulary as at the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua.

===Domes===
{{main|History of Italian Renaissance domes}}
[[File:StPetersDomePD.jpg|thumb|The Dome of St Peter's Basilica, Rome.&lt;!---this is an image that speaks for itself! The rest of the info is further down the page---&gt;]]
The dome is used frequently, both as a very large structural feature that is visible from the exterior, and also as a means of roofing smaller spaces where they are only visible internally. After the success of the dome in Brunelleschi's design for the [[Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore]] and its use in Bramante's plan for [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1506) in Rome, the dome became an indispensable element in church architecture and later even for secular architecture, such as Palladio's [[Villa Rotonda]].&lt;ref&gt;A major use of this feature is great dome of the [[US Capitol Building]] (begun 1856) in [[Washington, D.C.]] and all the subsequent State Capitals buildings in the [[Renaissance Revival]] style.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceilings===

Roofs are fitted with flat or [[coffered]] ceilings. They are not left open as in Medieval architecture. They are frequently painted or decorated.

===Doors===

Doors usually have square lintels. They may be set with in an arch or surmounted by a triangular or segmental pediment.
Openings that do not have doors are usually arched and frequently have a large or decorative keystone.

===Windows===

Windows may be paired and set within a semi-circular arch. They may have square lintels and triangular or segmental [[pediment]]s, which are often used alternately. Emblematic in this respect is the [[Palazzo Farnese]] in Rome, begun in 1517.
[[File:Palazzo Strozzi - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Courtyard of [[Palazzo Strozzi]], Florence]]
In the Mannerist period the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] arch was employed, using a motif of a high semi-circular topped opening flanked with two lower square-topped openings. Windows are used to bring light into the building and in domestic architecture, to give views. Stained glass, although sometimes present, is not a feature.

===Walls===

External walls are generally constructed of brick, rendered, or faced with stone in highly finished [[ashlar]] masonry, laid in straight courses. The corners of buildings are often emphasized by rusticated [[quoin (architecture)|quoins]]. Basements and ground floors were often [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]], as at the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] (1444–1460) in Florence. Internal walls are smoothly plastered and surfaced with [[lime wash]]. For more formal spaces, internal surfaces are decorated with [[fresco]]es.

===Details===

Courses, mouldings and all decorative details are carved with great precision. Studying and mastering the details of the ancient Romans was one of the important aspects of Renaissance theory. The different orders each required different sets of details. Some architects were stricter in their use of classical details than others, but there was also a good deal of innovation in solving problems, especially at corners. Mouldings stand out around doors and windows rather than being recessed, as in Gothic architecture. Sculptured figures may be set in niches or placed on plinths. They are not integral to the building as in Medieval architecture.&lt;ref name=BF&gt;[[Banister Fletcher]], ''History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''(first published 1896, current edition 2001, Elsevier Science &amp; Technology {{ISBN|0-7506-2267-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Renaissance==
The leading architects of the Early Renaissance or Quattrocento were [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Michelozzo]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]].

===Brunelleschi===
{{main|Filippo Brunelleschi}}
The person generally credited with bringing about the Renaissance view of architecture is [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], (1377–1446).&lt;ref&gt;Cropplestone, Trewin, ''World Architecture'', 1963, Hamlyn. Page 243&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying feature of the work of Brunelleschi was &quot;order&quot;.
[[File:Piazza SS Annunziata Firenze Apr 2008 (3).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Ospedale degli Innocenti]] in Florence.]]
In the early 15th century, Brunelleschi began to look at the world to see what the rules were that governed one's way of seeing. He observed that the way one sees regular structures such as the [[Florence Baptistery]] and the tiled pavement surrounding it follows a mathematical order – [[linear perspective]].

The buildings remaining among the ruins of ancient Rome appeared to respect a simple mathematical order in the way that Gothic buildings did not. One incontrovertible rule governed all [[Ancient Roman architecture]] – a semi-circular arch is exactly twice as wide as it is high. A fixed proportion with implications of such magnitude occurred nowhere in [[Gothic architecture]]. A Gothic pointed arch could be extended upwards or flattened to any proportion that suited the location. Arches of differing angles frequently occurred within the same structure. No set rules of proportion applied.

From the observation of the architecture of Rome came a desire for symmetry and careful proportion in which the form and composition of the building as a whole and all its subsidiary details have fixed relationships, each section in proportion to the next, and the architectural features serving to define exactly what those rules of proportion are.&lt;ref name= W&amp;M&gt;Robert Erich Wolf and Ronald Millen, ''Renaissance and Mannerist Art'', 1968, Harry N. Abrams.&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi gained the support of a number of wealthy Florentine patrons, including the Silk Guild and [[Cosimo de' Medici]].

[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore cupola (1622842169).jpg|thumb|left|The dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] (the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore)]]

====Florence Cathedral====
Brunelleschi's first major architectural commission was for the enormous brick dome which covers the central space of [[Duomo of Florence|Florence's cathedral]], designed by [[Arnolfo di Cambio]] in the 14th century but left unroofed. While often described as the first building of the Renaissance, Brunelleschi's daring design utilises the pointed Gothic arch and Gothic ribs that were apparently planned by Arnolfio. It seems certain, however, that while stylistically Gothic, in keeping with the building it surmounts, the dome is in fact structurally influenced by the great dome of Ancient Rome, which Brunelleschi could hardly have ignored in seeking a solution. This is the dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], a circular temple, now a church.

Inside the Pantheon's single-shell concrete dome is coffering which greatly decreases the weight. The vertical partitions of the coffering effectively serve as ribs, although this feature does not dominate visually. At the apex of the Pantheon's dome is an opening, 8 meters across. Brunelleschi was aware that a dome of enormous proportion could in fact be engineered without a keystone. The dome in Florence is supported by the eight large ribs and sixteen more internal ones holding a brick shell, with the bricks arranged in a herringbone manner. Although the techniques employed are different, in practice both domes comprise a thick network of ribs supporting very much lighter and thinner infilling. And both have a large opening at the top.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Einblick LH2 San Lorenzo Florenz.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The church of San Lorenzo]]

====San Lorenzo====
The new architectural philosophy of the Renaissance is best demonstrated in the churches of [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|San Lorenzo]], and [[Santo Spirito di Firenze|Santo Spirito]] in Florence. Designed by Brunelleschi in about 1425 and 1428 respectively, both have the shape of the [[Latin cross]]. Each has a modular plan, each portion being a multiple of the square bay of the aisle. This same formula controlled also the vertical dimensions. In the case of Santo Spirito, which is entirely regular in plan, transepts and chancel are identical, while the nave is an extended version of these. In 1434 Brunelleschi designed the first Renaissance centrally planned building, [[Santa Maria degli Angeli di Firenze|Santa Maria degli Angeli]] of Florence. It is composed of a central [[octagon]] surrounded by a circuit of eight smaller chapels. From this date onwards numerous churches were built in variations of these designs.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Fanelli, ''Brunelleschi'', 1980, Becocci editore Firenze&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michelozzo===
[[Michelozzo Michelozzi]] (1396–1472), was another architect under patronage of the [[Medici]] family, his most famous work being the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]], which he was commissioned to design for [[Medici|Cosimo de' Medici]] in 1444. A decade later he built the [[Villa Medici, Fiesole|Villa Medici]] at [[Fiesole]]. Among his other works for Cosimo are the library at the Convent of San Marco, Florence. He went into exile in Venice for a time with his patron. He was one of the first architects to work in the Renaissance style outside Italy, building a palace at [[Dubrovnik]].&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:Palazzo medici riccardi 33 Sailko adj.JPG|thumb|left|Palazzo Medici Riccardi by Michelozzo. Florence, 1444]]
The Palazzo Medici Riccardi is Classical in the details of its pedimented windows and recessed doors, but, unlike the works of Brunelleschi and Alberti, there are no [[classical orders]] of columns in evidence. Instead, Michelozzo has respected the Florentine liking for rusticated stone. He has seemingly created three orders out of the three defined rusticated levels, the whole being surmounted by an enormous Roman-style cornice which juts out over the street by 2.5 meters.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

===Alberti===
[[Leon Battista Alberti]], born in Genoa (1402–1472), was an important Humanist theoretician and designer whose book on architecture ''De re Aedificatoria'' was to have lasting effect. An aspect of [[Renaissance humanism]] was an emphasis of the anatomy of nature, in particular the human form, a science first studied by the Ancient Greeks. Humanism made man the measure of things. Alberti perceived the architect as a person with great social responsibilities.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

[[File:Mantova Concattedrale Sant'Andrea Apostolo Fassade 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua]], the façade]]
He designed a number of buildings, but unlike Brunelleschi, he did not see himself as a builder in a practical sense and so left the supervision of the work to others. Miraculously, one of his greatest designs, that of the [[Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua|Basilica of Sant'Andrea]] in Mantua, was brought to completion with its character essentially intact. Not so the [[Tempio Malatestiano|Church of San Francesco]] in Rimini, a rebuilding of a Gothic structure, which, like Sant'Andrea, was to have a façade reminiscent of a Roman triumphal arch. This was left sadly incomplete.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

Sant'Andrea is an extremely dynamic building both without and within. Its triumphal façade is marked by extreme contrasts. The projection of the order of pilasters that define the architectural elements, but are essentially non-functional, is very shallow. This contrasts with the gaping deeply recessed arch which makes a huge portico before the main door. The size of this arch is in direct contrast to the two low square-topped openings that frame it. The light and shade play dramatically over the surface of the building because of the shallowness of its mouldings and the depth of its porch. In the interior Alberti has dispensed with the traditional nave and aisles. Instead there is a slow and majestic progression of alternating tall arches and low square doorways, repeating the &quot;[[Arch of Constantine|triumphal arch]]&quot; motif of the façade.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ''Leonis Baptiste Alberti'', Architectural Design, Vol 49 No 5–6, Holland St, London&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Santa Maria Novella.jpg|thumb|left|Façade of [[Santa Maria Novella]], 1456–70]]
Two of Alberti’s best known buildings are in Florence, the [[Palazzo Rucellai]] and at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. For the palace, Alberti applied the classical orders of columns to the façade on the three levels, 1446–51. At Santa Maria Novella he was commissioned to finish the decoration of the façade. He completed the design in 1456 but the work was not finished until 1470.

The lower section of the building had Gothic niches and typical polychrome marble decoration. There was a large [[Oculus|ocular]] window in the end of the nave which had to be taken into account. Alberti simply respected what was already in place, and the Florentine tradition for polychrome that was well established at the [[Baptistery of Florence|Baptistery of San Giovanni]], the most revered building in the city. The decoration, being mainly polychrome marble, is mostly very flat in nature, but a sort of order is established by the regular compartments and the circular motifs which repeat the shape of the round window.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; For the first time, Alberti linked the lower roofs of the aisles to nave using two large scrolls. These were to become a standard Renaissance device for solving the problem of different roof heights and bridge the space between horizontal and vertical surfaces.&lt;ref name= Pevs&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Pelican, 1964, ISBN unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

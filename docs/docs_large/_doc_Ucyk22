There are several Indonesian adaptations of Ramayana, including the Javanese ''[[Kakawin Ramayana]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ramayana Kakawin Vol. 1 | work=archive.org | url=https://archive.org/details/RamayanaKakawinVol.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b0274d0f-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad|title=The Kakawin Ramayana -- an old Javanese rendering of the …|website=www.nas.gov.sg|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Balinese ''Ramakavaca''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DN4xDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=ramakavaca+Bali&amp;pg=PA277|title=ABC of Hinduism|last=Bhalla|first=Prem P.|date=2017-08-22|publisher=Educreation Publishing|page=277|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first half of ''[[Kakawin Ramayana]]'' is similar to the original Sanskrit version, while the latter half is very different.

''Kakawin Ramayana'' is believed to have been written in [[Central Java]] circa 870 AD during the reign of Mpu Sindok in the [[Medang Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

[[File:Burmese Ramayana dance.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rama (Yama) and Sita (Me Thida) in [[Yama Zatdaw]], the Burmese version of ''Ramyana'']]
Yama Zatdaw is the [[Burma|Burmese]] version of Ramayana. It is also considered the unofficial national epic of [[Myanmar]]. There are nine known pieces of the Yama Zatdaw in Myanmar. The Burmese name for the story itself is Yamayana, while zatdaw refers to the acted play or being part of the [[jataka tales]] of Theravada Buddhism. This Burmese version is also heavily influenced by [[Ramakien]] (Thai version of Ramayana) which resulted from various invasions by [[Konbaung Dynasty]] kings toward the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]].

====Philippines====

{{main|Maharadia Lawana}}
The ''[[Maharadia Lawana]]'', an epic poem of the [[Maranao people]] of the [[Philippines]], has been regarded as an indigenized version of the Ramayana since it was documented and translated into English by Professor [[Juan R. Francisco]]  and Nagasura Madale in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillermo2011&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBWye7c8NuYC |title=Historical Dictionary of the Philippines |last=Guillermo |first=Artemio R. |date=2011-12-16 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810875111 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=&quot;264&quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Francisco|first=Juan R.|date=|title=Maharadia Lawana|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-07-02-1969/franciso-maharadia%20lawana.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem, which had not been written down before Francisco and Madale's translation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillermo2011&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=&quot;264&quot;}} narrates the adventures of the monkey-king, Maharadia Lawana, whom the Gods have gifted with immortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillermo2011&quot;/&gt;

Francisco, an indologist from the [[University of the Philippines Manila]], believed that the Ramayana narrative arrived in the Philippines some time between the 17th to 19th centuries, via interactions with Javanese and Malaysian cultures which traded extensively with India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francisco1989&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=FRANCISCO|first=JUAN R.|date=1989|title=The Indigenization of the Rama Story in the Philippines|jstor=42633135|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=37|issue=1|pages=101–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=101}}

By the time it was documented in the 1960s, the character names, place names, and the precise episodes and events in Maharadia Lawana's narrative already had some notable differences from those of the Ramayana.  Francisco believed that this was a sign of &quot;indigenization&quot;, and suggested that some changes had already been introduced in Malaysia and Java even before the story was heard by the Maranao, and that upon reaching the Maranao homeland, the story was &quot;''further indigenized to suit Philippine cultural perspectives and orientations.''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Francisco1989&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=&quot;103&quot;}}

====Thailand====

[[File:Khon Dance Frankfurt Germany 2006.jpg|thumb|320px|right|The Thai retelling of the tale—[[Ramakien]]—is popularly expressed in [[Dance in Thailand|traditional regional dance]] theatre]]
Thailand's popular national epic [[Ramakien]] (Thai:รามเกียรติ์., from Sanskrit ''rāmakīrti'', ''glory of Ram'') is derived from the Hindu epic. In Ramakien, Sita is the daughter of Ravana and Mandodari (''thotsakan'' and ''montho''). Vibhishana (''phiphek''), the astrologer brother of Ravana, predicts the death of Ravana from the horoscope of Sita. Ravana has thrown her into the water, but she is later rescued by Janaka (''chanok'').&lt;ref name=&quot;A.K&quot; /&gt;{{rp|149}} While the main story is identical to that of ''Ramayana'', many other aspects were transposed into a Thai context, such as the clothes, weapons, topography and elements of nature, which are described as being Thai in style. It has an expanded role for Hanuman and he is portrayed as a lascivious character. Ramakien can be seen in an elaborate illustration at [[Wat Phra Kaew]] in Bangkok.

===Critical edition===

A [[critical edition]] of the text was compiled in India in the 1960s and 1970s, by the Oriental Institute at [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda#Oriental Institute|Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]], India, utilizing dozens of manuscripts collected from across India and the surrounding region.&lt;ref name=&quot;berkeley&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/11/17/ramayana-translation-project-turns-its-last-page-after-four-decades-of-research/|publisher=news.berkeley.edu|title=Ramayana Translation Project turns its last page, after four decades of research &amp;#124; Berkeley News|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An English language translation of the critical edition was completed in November 2016 by Sanskrit scholar Robert P.

==Influence on culture and art==

{{see also|Ramayana Ballet}}
[[File:An Ramlila Actor In The Role of Ravana.jpg|thumb|A [[Ramlila]] actor wears the traditional attire of Ravana.]]

One of the most important literary works of [[History of India|ancient India]], the ''Ramayana'' has had a profound impact on art and culture in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and southeast Asia with the lone exception of Vietnam. The story ushered in the tradition of the next thousand years of massive-scale works in the rich diction of regal courts and Hindu temples. It has also inspired much secondary literature in various languages, notably [[Kambaramayanam]] by [[Tamils|Tamil]] poet [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] of the 12th century, [[Telugu language]] ''Molla Ramayanam'' by poet [[Molla (poet)|Molla]] and [[Ranganatha Ramayanam]] by poet Gona Budda Reddy, 14th century [[Kannada]] poet [[Narahari]]'s Torave Ramayana and 15th century [[Bengali people|Bengali]] poet [[Krittibas Ojha]]'s [[Krittivasi Ramayan]], as well as the 16th century [[Awadhi]] version, [[Ramacharitamanas]], written by [[Tulsidas]].

Ramayanic scenes have also been depicted through [[terracottas]], [[stone sculpture]]s, [[bronze]]s and [[paintings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;B. B. Lal 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Rāma, His Historicity, Mandir, and Setu: Evidence of Literature, Archaeology, and Other Sciences|author=B. B.

B. Lal 2008&quot;/&gt;

The ''Ramayana'' became popular in Southeast Asia during 8th century and was represented in literature, temple architecture, dance and theatre. Today, dramatic enactments of the story of the ''Ramayana'', known as [[Ramlila]], take place all across India and in many places across the globe within the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]].

In [[Indonesia]], especially [[Java]] and [[Bali]], Ramayana has become a popular source of artistic expression for dance drama and shadow puppet performance in the region. Sendratari Ramayana is [[Javanese dance|Javanese traditional ballet]] of [[wayang orang]] genre, routinely performed in [[Prambanan]] Trimurti temple and in cultural center of [[Yogyakarta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = The New York Times | title = On Java, a Creative Explosion in an Ancient City | author = Donald Frazier | date = 11 February 2016 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/travel/indonesia-yogyakarta-java-island.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Balinese dance|Balinese dance drama]] of Ramayana is also performed routinely in [[Balinese temples|Balinese Hindu temples]], especially in temples such as [[Ubud]] and [[Uluwatu Temple|Uluwatu]], where scenes from Ramayana is integrap part of [[kecak]] dance performance. Javanese [[wayang kulit]] purwa also draws its episodes from Ramayana or Mahabharata.

The epic tale was picturized on canvas in epic proportions measuring 152 x 823&amp;nbsp;cm in 9 panels. The painting depicts three prolific parts of the epic, namely The Abduction of Sita, Hanuman visits Sita and Hanuman Burns Lanka.

==Religious significance==

[[File:Srisita ram laxman hanuman manor.JPG|thumb|right|Deities Sita (right), Rama (center), Lakshmana (left) and Hanuman (below, seated) at [[Bhaktivedanta Manor]], [[Watford]], England]]

Rama, the hero of the ''Ramayana'', is one of the most popular deities worshipped in the Hindu religion. Each year, many devout pilgrims trace their journey through India and Nepal, halting at each of the holy sites along the way. The poem is not seen as just a literary monument, but serves as an integral part of Hinduism and is held in such reverence that the mere reading or hearing of it or certain passages of it, is believed by Hindus to free them from sin and bless the reader or listener.

According to Hindu tradition, Rama is an incarnation ([[Avatar]]) of god [[Vishnu]]. The main purpose of this incarnation is to demonstrate the righteous path ([[dharma]]) for all living creatures on earth.

==In popular culture==

Multiple modern, English-language adaptations of the epic exist, namely [[Scion of Ikshvaku|Rama Chandra Series]] by [[Amish Tripathi]], [[Ashok Banker#Ramayana Series|Ramayana Series]] by [[Ashok Banker]] and a mythopoetic novel, ''Asura: Tale of the Vanquished'' by [[Anand Neelakantan]]. Another Indian author, [[Devdutt Pattanaik]], has published three different retellings and commentaries of Ramayana titled ''Sita'', ''The Book Of Ram'' and ''Hanuman's Ramayan''. A number of plays, movies and television serials have also been produced based upon the ''Ramayana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mankekar|first=Purnima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZf8wmVdpaIC&amp;q=ramayana+in+serial&amp;pg=PA165|title=Screening Culture, Viewing Politics: An Ethnography of Television, Womanhood, and Nation in Postcolonial India|date=1999|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-2390-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]], &quot;Ramayana&quot; [[department store]] is named after the epic. The company which owns it is known as ''PT Ramayana Lestari Sentosa'' founded in 1978 with its main office located in [[Jakarta]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

One of the best known Ramayana plays is Gopal Sharman's The Ramayana, a contemporary interpretation in English, of the great epic based on the Valmiki Ramayana. The play has had more than 3000 plus performances all over the world, mostly as a one-woman performance by actress Jalabala Vaidya, wife of the playwright Gopal Sharman. The Ramayana has been performed on Broadway, London's West End, United Nations Headquarters, the Smithsonian Institution among other international venue and in more than 35 cities and towns in India.

Starting in 1978 and under the supervision of [[Baba Hari Dass]], Ramayana has been performed every year by Mount Madonna School in Watsonville, California.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Currently,{{when|date=June 2019}} it is the largest yearly, Western version of the epic being performed.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} It takes the form of a colorful musical with custom costumes, sung and spoken dialog, [[jazz-rock]] orchestration and dance. This performance takes place in a large audience theater setting usually in June, in San Jose, CA. Dass has taught acting arts, costume-attire design, mask making and choreography to bring alive characters of [[Rama]], [[Sita]], [[Hanuman]], [[Lakshmana]], [[Shiva]], [[Parvati]], [[Vibhishan]], [[Jatayu]], [[Sugriva]], [[Surpanakha]], [[Ravana]] and his [[rakshasa]] court, Meghnadha, [[Kumbhakarna]] and the army of monkeys and demons.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In the Philippines, a jazz ballet production was produced in the 1970's entitled &quot;Rama at Sita&quot; (Rama and Sita).

The production was a result of a collaboration of four National Artists, Bienvenido Lumbera’s libretto (National Artist for Literature), production design by Salvador Bernal (National Artist for Stage Design), music by Ryan Cayabyab (National Artist for Music) and choreography by Alice Reyes (National Artist for Dance).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturalcenter.gov.ph/events/dance/ballet-philippines-rama-hari/details|title=BALLET PHILIPPINES' RAMA, HARI &amp;#124; Cultural Center of the Philippines|first=Cultural Center of the|last=Philippines|website=BALLET PHILIPPINES' RAMA, HARI|accessdate=19 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early cases, it was easier for plaintiffs to show market relationship, or dominance, by tailoring market definition, even if it ignored fundamental principles of economics. In ''[[U.S. v. Grinnell]]'', 384 U.S. 563 (1966), the trial judge, [[Charles Wyzanski]], composed the market only of alarm companies with services in every state, tailoring out any local competitors; the defendant stood alone in this market, but had the court added up the entire national market, it would have had a much smaller share of the national market for alarm services that the court purportedly used. The appellate courts affirmed this finding; however, today, an appellate court would likely find this definition to be flawed. Modern courts use a more sophisticated market definition that does not permit as manipulative a definition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Monopoly===
Section 2 of the Act forbade monopoly. In Section 2 cases, the court has, again on its own initiative, drawn a distinction between [[Coercive monopoly|coercive]] and innocent monopoly. The act is not meant to punish businesses that come to dominate their market passively or on their own merit, only those that intentionally dominate the market through misconduct, which generally consists of conspiratorial conduct of the kind forbidden by Section 1 of the Sherman Act, or Section 3 of the Clayton Act.

===Application of the act outside pure commerce===
The Act was aimed at regulating businesses. However, its application was not limited to the commercial side of business. Its prohibition of the cartel was also interpreted to make illegal many labor union activities. This is because unions were characterized as cartels as well (cartels of laborers).&lt;ref&gt;See {{ussc|name=Loewe v. Lawlor|link=|volume=208|page=274|pin=|year=1908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This persisted until 1914, when the [[Clayton Antitrust Act|Clayton Act]] created exceptions for certain union activities.

==Preemption by Section 1 of state statutes that restrain competition==
{{Main|Sherman Antitrust Act (federal preemption)}}
To determine whether a particular state statute that restrains competition was intended to be preempted by the Act, courts will engage in a two-step analysis, as set forth by the Supreme Court in ''[[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]]'':
* First, they will inquire whether the state legislation &quot;mandates or authorizes conduct that necessarily constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws in all cases, or ... places irresistible pressure on a private party to violate the antitrust laws in order to comply with the statute.&quot; ''[[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]]'', 458 U.S. 654, 661; see also ''[[324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy]]'', 479 U.S. 335 (1987) (&quot;Our decisions reflect the principle that the federal antitrust laws pre-empt state laws authorizing or compelling private parties to engage in anticompetitive behavior.&quot;)
* Second, they will consider whether the state statute is saved from preemption by the [[state action immunity doctrine]] (aka ''Parker'' immunity). In ''[[California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.]]'', 445 U.S. 97, 105 (1980), the Supreme Court established a two-part test for applying the doctrine: &quot;First, the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself.&quot; Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted).

== Criticism ==
{{See also|United States antitrust law|Competition law}}
[[Alan Greenspan]], in his essay entitled ''Antitrust''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polyconomics.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1605:antitrust-by-alan-greenspan&amp;catid=47:1998 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510124441/http://www.polyconomics.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1605:antitrust-by-alan-greenspan&amp;catid=47:1998 |archivedate=2014-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; described the Sherman Act as stifling innovation and harming society. &quot;No one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, and cost-saving mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Act before they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible.&quot; Greenspan summarized the nature of antitrust law as: &quot;a jumble of economic irrationality and ignorance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Criticisms such as this one, attributed to Greenspan, are not directed at the Sherman act in particular, but rather at the underlying policy of all antitrust law, which includes several pieces of legislation other than just the Sherman Act, e.g. the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenspan at that time was a disciple and friend of [[Ayn Rand]], and he first published ''Antitrust'' in Rand's monthly publication ''The Objectivist Newsletter.'' Rand, who described herself as &quot;a radical for capitalism,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Check Your Premises,'' The Objectivist Newsletter, January 1962, vol. 1, no. 1, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; opposed antitrust law not only on economic grounds but also morally, as a violation of property rights, asserting that the &quot;meaning and purpose&quot; of antitrust law is &quot;the penalizing of ability for being ability, the penalizing of success for being success, and the sacrifice of productive genius to the demands of envious mediocrity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal,'' Ch. 3, New American Library, Signet, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[William E. Mason (American politician)|William Mason]] said &quot;trusts have made products cheaper, have reduced prices; but if the price of oil, for instance, were reduced to one cent a barrel, it would not right the wrong done to people of this country by the trusts which have destroyed legitimate competition and driven honest men from legitimate business enterprise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, 51st Congress, 1st session, House, June 20, 1890, p. 4100.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, if the primary goal of the act is to protect consumers, and consumers are protected by lower prices, the act may be harmful if it reduces [[economy of scale]], a price-lowering mechanism, by breaking up big businesses. Mason put small business survival, a justice interest, on a level concomitant with the pure economic rationale of consumer 

Economist [[Thomas DiLorenzo]] notes that Senator Sherman sponsored the 1890 [[William McKinley]] tariff just three months after the Sherman Act, and agrees with ''[[The New York Times]]'' which wrote on October 1, 1890: &quot;That so-called Anti-Trust law was passed to deceive the people and to clear the way for the enactment of this Pro-Trust law relating to the tariff.&quot; The ''Times'' went on to assert that Sherman merely supported this &quot;humbug&quot; of a law &quot;in order that party organs might say...'Behold! We have attacked the trusts. The Republican Party is the enemy of all such rings.'&quot; &lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/10/01/103268337.pdf|title=Mr. Sherman's Hopes and Fears|date=1890-10-01|accessdate=2008-04-21|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dilorenzo writes: &quot;Protectionists did not want prices paid by consumers to fall. But they also understood that to gain political support for high tariffs they would have to assure the public that industries would not combine to increase prices to politically prohibitive levels. Support for both an antitrust law and tariff hikes would maintain high prices while avoiding the more obvious bilking of consumers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DiLorenzo, Thomas, ''Cato Handbook for Congress'', Antitrust.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Bork]] was well known for his outspoken criticism of the antitrust regime. Another conservative legal scholar and judge, [[Richard Posner]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]], does not condemn the entire regime, but expresses concern with the potential that it could be applied to create inefficiency, rather than to avoid inefficiency.&lt;ref name=posner&gt;Richard Posner, ''Economic Analysis of Law'', p. 295 et seq. (explaining the optimal antitrust regime from an economic point of view)&lt;/ref&gt; Posner further believes, along with a number of others, including Bork, that genuinely inefficient cartels and coercive monopolies, the target of the act, would be self-corrected by market forces, making the strict penalties of antitrust legislation unnecessary.&lt;ref name=posner /&gt;

Conversely, liberal [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[William O. Douglas]] criticized the judiciary for interpreting and enforcing the antitrust law unequally: &quot;From the beginning it [the Sherman Act] has been applied by judges hostile to its purposes, friendly to the empire builders who wanted it emasculated... trusts that were dissolved reintegrated in new forms... It is ironic that the Sherman Act was truly effective in only one respect, and that was when it was applied to labor unions.  Then the courts read it with a literalness that never appeared in their other decisions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, William O., ''An Almanac of Liberty'', Doubleday &amp; Company, 1954, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2018 study in the journal ''Public Choice'', &quot;Senator John Sherman of Ohio was motivated to introduce an antitrust bill in late 1889 partly as a way of enacting revenge on his political rival, General and former Governor Russell Alger of Michigan, because Sherman believed that Alger personally had cost him the presidential nomination at the 1888 Republican national convention... Sherman was able to pursue his revenge motive by combining it with the broader Republican goals of preserving high tariffs and attacking the trusts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Newman |first=Patrick |date=2018-01-12 |title=Revenge: John Sherman, Russell Alger and the origins of the Sherman Act |journal=Public Choice |volume=174 |issue=3–4 |language=en |pages=257–275 |doi=10.1007/s11127-017-0497-x |s2cid=158141317 |issn=0048-5829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Machaeridia''' is an extinct group of armoured, segmented [[annelid]] worms, known from the Early [[Ordovician]] (Late Tremadoc) to [[Carboniferous]]. It consists of three distinct families: the plumulitids, turrilepadids and lepidocoleids.&lt;ref name=Vinther2008&gt;{{cite journal |

==Fossils==
Only the calcitic sclerites (&quot;armour plates&quot;) of these worms tend to be preserved in the fossil record.  These are tiny, and usually found disarticulated:  articulated specimens reach about a centimeter in length, and are incredibly rare – hence the limited degree of study since their description in 1857.&lt;ref name=Caron2008&gt;{{cite journal

The machaeridians are characterized by having serialized rows of calcitic shell plates.  The dorsal [[sclerite]]s were convex and almost isometric; lateral sclerites were flatter and longer.&lt;ref name=Dzik1986/&gt; The plates comprised two calcite layers: the outer layer is thin and formed by lamellar deposition, whereas new elements were added to the thicker inner layer as it grew.&lt;ref name=Hogstrom2003&gt;{{Cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scales are ridged with growth lines, implying that they grew episodically.&lt;ref name=Dzik1986/&gt;  A few taxa experimented with different approaches to scale formation; some were only very weakly calcified and may have mainly been organic in nature.&lt;ref name=Dzik1986/&gt; They were never moulted, and each scale could be moved with an attached muscle.&lt;ref name=Dzik1986/&gt;

The front two segments of the machaeridians were commonly different from the rest, bearing fewer spiny projections.&lt;ref name=Dzik1986/&gt;

The plumulitids are flattened from above and looks much like the coat of mail armour of chitons. The two other families are laterally compressed and some lepidocoleids formed a dorsal hinge, which make these machaeridians look like a string of bivalves.

==Ecology==

Machaeridians are often found in association with [[stylophoran]]s - the [[cornute]]s and [[mitrate]]s.  This suggests that they possessed a similar ecology.  They probably fed on organic detritus, perhaps even the faeces of the accompanying stylophorans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = B. | title = Early Palaeozoic palaeobiogeography and palaeoecology of stylophoran echinoderms | journal =  	Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology| last1 = Lefebvre | volume = 245 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 156–199 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2006.02.021| bibcode = 2007PPP...245..156L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their scales almost certainly performed a defensive role.&lt;ref name=Dzik1986&gt;{{Cite book
 | author = Dzik, J.
 | year = 1986
 | chapter = Turrilepadida and other Machaeridia
 | pages = 116–134

 | title=Problematic Fossil Taxa
 | publisher = Oxford University Press, Oxford; Calderon Press, New York
 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisms would have had limited ability to flex to the right and left (in the [[sagittal plane]]), but would have been able to roll up.&lt;ref name=Dzik1986/&gt;  While most possessed bilateral symmetry, the scales on the right and left side of ''Turrilepas wrightiana'' are different in shape and form.&lt;ref name=Dzik1986/&gt;
The Plumulitid machaeridians would have moved across the surface of the sea floor using parapodia, whereas the fully armoured Turrelepids and Lepidocoelids burrowed in a peristaltic fashion reminiscent of their evolutionary cousins, the earthworms.&lt;ref name='Vinther2009'&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = J.| first2 = D. E. G. | title = Machaeridian locomotion| last1 = Vinther | journal = Lethaia| volume = 42| issue = 3| pages = 357–364 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1502-3931.2009.00165.x| last2 =  Briggs }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This burrowing role has subjected them to the same evolutionary pressures which affect burrowing bivalves; [[convergent evolution]] as a result of their shared function probably contributed to early suggestions that the machaeridians should be classified with the molluscs.&lt;ref name=Vinther2009/&gt;

==Taxonomic affinity==
{{see also|List of Annelid families}}
The group has historically been assigned to variously the echinoderms, barnacles, annelids and mollusks.  Relationships to other Cambrian forms (such as the Halkieriids) have been proposed and discounted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03115519208619031|title=Machaeridian classification|journal=Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology|volume=16|pages=15–32|year=1992|last1=Adrain|first1=Jonathan M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the discovery of a fossil preserving soft tissue (including chaetae and parapodia) established an annelid affinity.  Machaeridians represent the only instance of this group developing calcitic armour (notwithstanding certain polychaetes that integrate calcite into their chaetae). The exact position with annelids remains unresolved, though some characters indicate a relationship to Aphroditacean annelids (Vinther et al. 2008). In an accompanying commentary, Jean-Bernard Caron suggested that machaeridians must be a stem group based on number of specialised features. However, one cannot assess crown group/stem group affinities based on autapomorphies, but on shared morphological traits or the lack thereof. He also suggested that machaeridians might be polyphyletic, but machaerdians are a well defined group with a number of shared characters and morphological gradations between all three families.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Electoral fusion''' is an arrangement where two or more [[Political party|political parties]] on a [[ballot]] list the same [[candidate]], pooling the votes for that candidate. It is distinct from the process of [[electoral alliance]]s in that the political parties remain separately listed on the ballot. The practice of electoral fusion in [[jurisdiction]]s where it exists allows minor parties to influence election results and policy by offering to endorse or nominate a major party's candidate.

Electoral fusion is also known as fusion voting, cross endorsement, multiple party nomination, multi-party nomination, plural nomination, and ballot freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;What is Fusion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonwfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Whatisfusion.pdf |title=What is Fusion |publisher=Oregon Working Families Party |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415131853/http://oregonwfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Whatisfusion.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief for appellant&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizen.org/litigation/article_redirect.cfm?ID=666 |title=Brief for appellant: Twin Cities Area New Party vs Secretary of State of Minnesota |publisher=Public Citizen Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Argentina ==

Electoral fusion is currently used only in provincial elections in [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], [[Formosa Province|Formosa]], [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]], [[La Rioja Province, Argentina|La Rioja]], [[Neuquén Province|Neuquén]], [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra del Fuego]] and  [[Tucumán Province]]s.

In the past it was used in [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Chaco Province|Chaco]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]], [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]], [[Santiago del Estero Province]]s and [[Buenos Aires City]].

== Australia ==
Elections for the [[Australian Senate]] allow for joint Senate tickets, which &quot;contains members that have been endorsed by more than one registered political party&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Financial Disclosure Guide for Candidates and Senate Groups 2016 Federal Election |url=https://www.aec.gov.au/parties_and_representatives/financial_disclosure/guides/candidates/files/candidates-and-senate-groups-guide-2016.pdf |website=Australian Electoral Commission |accessdate=15 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of fusion tickets include the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] and [[National Party of Australia|Nationals]] fusion ticket, and the [[Australian Sex Party|Sex Party]] and [[Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP) Party|HEMP Party]] fusion ticket in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Election Funding and Disclosure Report Federal Election 2016 |url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/financial_disclosure/files/reports/funding-disclosure-2016.pdf |website=Australian Electoral Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
While no party law exists in Hong Kong, candidates in election may list their &quot;political affiliation&quot; on ballots, and there is no restriction regarding the number of political parties or organisations a candidate report to be affiliated with. For example, in the [[2004 Hong Kong legislative election|2004]] Legislative Council election [[Chan Kam Lam]], of the [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]], and [[Chan Yuen Han]] (unrelated), of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions]], running on different [[pro-Beijing]] tickets in the same multi-member constituency, were endorsed by both parties.

==Italy==
Electoral fusion is provided for and regulated by the [[Italian Parliament#Electoral system|Italian electoral system]] for [[general election]]s, in order to get a [[majority bonus]]. However the parties can run as stand-alones.

That is also provided for [[administrative division]]s, to get the majority bonus in support of the [[candidate]] who gets the relative chief office.

==Netherlands==
The Dutch electoral law accepts common lists. In a common list two or more political parties share a list and often have a common political programme for the election. The participating political parties are identifiable for the voters because the names of these parties are mentioned on the voting paper.

==Panama==
Before the [[2014 Panamanian general election]] most of the presidental candidates were endorsed by coalitions of multiple parties.

==Philippines==
In the [[2010 Philippine presidential election|2010 presidential elections]], Senator [[Loren Legarda]] announced her bid for vice president and was announced as running mate of [[Nacionalista Party]] presidentiable Senator [[Manny Villar]].

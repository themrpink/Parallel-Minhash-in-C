In [[electronics]], '''gain''' is a measure of the ability of a [[two-port]] [[electrical network|circuit]] (often an [[amplifier]]) to increase the [[Electric power|power]] or [[amplitude]] of a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] from the input to the output port&lt;ref name=&quot;Graf&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by adding energy converted from some [[power supply]] to the signal. It is usually defined as the mean [[ratio]] of the [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] amplitude or power at the output [[port (circuit theory)|port]] to the amplitude or power at the input port.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graf&quot; /&gt; It is often expressed using the [[logarithm]]ic  [[decibel]] (dB) units (&quot;dB gain&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;  A gain greater than one (greater than zero dB), that is amplification, is the defining property of an [[active component]] or circuit, while a [[passive circuit]] will have a gain of less than one.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;

The term ''gain'' alone is ambiguous, and can refer to the ratio of output to input  [[voltage]] (''voltage gain''), [[Electric current|current]] (''current gain'') or electric power (''power gain'').&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;  In the field of audio and general purpose amplifiers, especially [[operational amplifier]]s, the term usually refers to voltage gain,&lt;ref name=&quot;Basu&quot; /&gt;  but in [[radio frequency]] amplifiers it usually refers to power gain.  Furthermore, the term gain is also applied in systems such as [[sensor]]s where the input and output have different units; in such cases the gain units must be specified, as in &quot;5 microvolts per photon&quot; for the [[responsivity]] of a [[photosensor]]. The &quot;gain&quot; of a [[bipolar transistor]] normally refers to forward current transfer ratio, either ''h''&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt; (&quot;beta&quot;, the static ratio of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; divided by ''I''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; at some operating point), or sometimes ''h''&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt; (the small-signal current gain, the slope of the graph of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; against ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; at a point).

The gain of an electronic device or circuit generally varies with the [[frequency]] of the applied signal.  Unless otherwise stated, the term refers to the gain for frequencies in the [[passband]], the intended operating frequency range of the equipment. 
The term ''gain'' has a different meaning in [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] design; [[antenna gain]] is the ratio of [[radiation intensity]] from a directional antenna to &lt;math&gt;P_\text{in}/4\pi&lt;/math&gt; (mean radiation intensity from a lossless antenna).

At any instant the output voltage is three times the input voltage.]]

==Logarithmic units and decibels==

===Power gain===
[[Power gain]], in [[decibel]]s (dB), is defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{gain-db}=10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{P_\text{out}}{P_\text{in}}\right)~\text{dB},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt; is the power applied to the input, &lt;math&gt;P_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt; is the power from the output.

A similar calculation can be done using a [[natural logarithm]] instead of a decimal logarithm, resulting in [[neper]]s instead of decibels:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{gain-np} = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{P_\text{out}}{P_\text{in}}\right)~\text{Np}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Voltage gain===
The power gain can be calculated using voltage instead of power using [[Joule's first law]] &lt;math&gt;P = V^2/R&lt;/math&gt;; the formula is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{gain-db} = 10 \log{\frac{\frac{V_\text{out}^2}{R_\text{out}}}{\frac{V_\text{in}^2}{R_\text{in}}}}~\mathrm{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

In many cases, the input impedance &lt;math&gt;R_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt; and output impedance &lt;math&gt;R_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt; are equal, so the above equation can be simplified to:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{gain-db} = 10 \log \left(\frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}}\right)^2~\text{dB},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{gain-db} = 20 \log \left(\frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}}\right)~\text{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

This simplified formula, the [[20 log rule]], is used to calculate a '''voltage gain''' in decibels and is equivalent to a power gain if and only if the [[Electrical impedance|impedances]] at input and output are equal.

===Current gain===
In the same way, when power gain is calculated using current instead of power, making the substitution &lt;math&gt;P = I^2 R&lt;/math&gt;, the formula is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{gain-db} = 10 \log{\left(\frac{I_\text{out}^2 R_\text{out}}{I_\text{in}^2 R_\text{in}}\right)}~\text{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

In many cases, the input and output impedances are equal, so the above equation can be simplified to:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{gain-db} = 10 \log \left(\frac{I_\text{out}}{I_\text{in}}\right)^2~\text{dB},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{gain-db} = 20 \log \left(\frac{I_\text{out}}{I_\text{in}}\right)~\text{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

This simplified formula is used to calculate a '''current gain''' in decibels and is equivalent to the power gain if and only if the [[Electrical impedance|impedances]] at input and output are equal.

The &quot;current gain&quot; of a [[bipolar transistor]],  &lt;math&gt;h_\text{FE}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;h_\text{fe}&lt;/math&gt;, is normally given as a dimensionless number, the ratio of &lt;math&gt;I_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;I_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; (or slope of the &lt;math&gt;I_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt;-versus-&lt;math&gt;I_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; graph, for &lt;math&gt;h_\text{fe}&lt;/math&gt;).

In the cases above, gain will be a dimensionless quantity, as it is the ratio of like units (decibels are not used as units, but rather as a method of indicating a logarithmic relationship).  In the bipolar transistor example, it is the ratio of the output current to the input current, both measured in [[ampere]]s. In the case of other devices, the gain will have a value in [[SI]] units. Such is the case with the [[operational transconductance amplifier]], which has an open-loop gain ([[transconductance]]) in [[siemens (unit)|siemens]] ([[mho]]s), because the gain is a ratio of the output current to the input voltage.

===Example===
Q. An amplifier has an input impedance of 50 ohms and drives a load of 50 ohms. When its input (&lt;math&gt;V_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt;) is 1 volt, its output (&lt;math&gt;V_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt;) is 10 volts. What is its voltage and power gain?

A. Voltage gain is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{gain} = \frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}} = \frac{10}{1} = 10~\text{V/V}.&lt;/math&gt;

The units V/V are optional but make it clear that this figure is a voltage gain and not a power gain.
Using the expression for power, ''P'' = ''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''R'', the power gain is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{gain} = \frac{V_\text{out}^2/50}{V_\text{in}^2/50} = \frac{V_\text{out}^2}{V_\text{in}^2} = \frac{10^2}{1^2} = 100~\text{W/W}.&lt;/math&gt;

Again, the units W/W are optional. Power gain is more usually expressed in decibels, thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{gain-db} = G_\text{dB} = 10 \log G_\text{W/W} = 10 \log 100 = 10 \times 2 = 20~\text{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

A gain of factor 1 (equivalent to 0&amp;nbsp;dB) where both input and output are at the same voltage level and impedance is also known as ''[[1 (number)|unity]] gain''.

With the decline of [[Shahrisabz]] in the 18th century, Qarshi grew in importance, and was the seat of the Crown Prince to the Emirate of Bukhara. The city had a double set of walls, 10 [[caravanserai]]s and 4 [[madrassahs]] during this time. By 1868, the [[Russians]] had annexed the [[Zarafshan]] Valley, and in 1873, the treaty turning Bukhara into a Russian [[protectorate]] was signed in Qarshi, much to the dismay of the Emir's son, Abdul Malik, who took to the hills in rebellion.

In the early 1970s, the first section of a major [[irrigation]] project was completed to divert water from the [[Amu Darya]] River in [[Turkmenistan]] eastward into Uzbekistan in order to irrigate the land surrounding Qarshi.  Almost all of these irrigated lands around Qarshi are planted with [[cotton]].

== Main Sites ==

=== Odina Mosque ===

* Odina Mosque was built in the 16th century and is on the southeast side of Qarshi’s Eski Bazaar. The mosque was built on the site of an older [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] palace, which had also been used as a prison&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ibbotson|first=Sophie|title=Uzbekistan|publisher=Bradt Guides Ltd|year=2020|isbn=9 781784 771089|location=United Kingdom|pages=191-192}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The mosque has an attractive domed exterior, and also a sardoba, a domed reservoir which stopped the water supply becoming contaminated or evaporating. It is no longer used for worship but instead houses Qarshi’s Regional Museum.

=== Madrassas ===

* There are three [[Madrasa|madrassas]] in Qarshi, all on the same square. These are the Kalizbek, Bakmir, and Khodjaev Abdul Aziz Madrasas, which were all built between 1904 and 1915&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;. The madrassas no longer have a religious function and are in need of reservation, but tourists can enter inside if they ask the guardian.
* Rabiya Madrassah - a late 19th-century female madrassah

=== Kok Gumbas ===

* Kok Gumbaz (which means “blue dome”) is Qarshi’s [[Jama masjid|Friday Mosque]]. It is the largest such mosque in the region, and was constructed by [[Ulugh Beg|Emperor Ulugbek]] on behalf of his father, [[Shah Rukh]], in the late 16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Kok Gumbaz, Shakhrisabz|url=https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/shakhrisabz/kok_gumbaz.htm|access-date=2020-11-01|website=www.advantour.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Kok Gumbaz is architecturally quite similar to other [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] mosques, including in [[Shahrisabz|Shakhrisabz]], but it has been less heavily restored, so more of the original features remain intact.

=== World War II Memorial ===

* Qarshi’s war memorial to casualties of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] is one of the largest [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era memorials in Central Asia. It is a mix of walkways, plaques, an [[eternal flame]], and a red star-topped tower with a series of stained-glass windows. It is possible to access the upper levels of the memorial on request&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;.

The '''history of Jordan''' refers to the history of the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] and the background period of the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] under British protectorate as well as the general history of the region of [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]].

There is evidence of human activity in Transjordan as early as the [[Paleolithic]] period. The area was settled by nomadic tribes in the [[Bronze Age]], which consolidated in small kingdoms during the [[Iron Age]] – such as the [[Ammon]]ites, [[Moab]]ites and [[Edomites]], with partial areas controlled by the [[Israelites]]. In the classic period, Transjordan came under Greek and later Roman influence. Under the Romans and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], Transjordan was home to the [[Decapolis]] in the north, with much of the region being designated as [[Byzantine Arabia]]. Classical kingdoms located in the region of Transjordan, such as the Roman-era [[Nabatean kingdom]], which had its capital at [[Petra]], left particularly dramatic ruins popular today with tourists and filmmakers. The history of Transjordan continued with the [[Caliphate|Muslim empires]] starting in the 7th century, partial [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|crusader]] control in the mid-Middle Ages (country of [[Oultrejordain]]) and finally, [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] rule from the 13th century and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule between the 16th century and the [[First World War]]. 

With the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]] in 1916 and the consequent British invasion, the area came under the Anglo-Arab ruled [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]] East in 1917, which was declared as the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] in 1920. Following the French occupation of only the northern part of the Syrian Kingdom, [[Interregnum (Transjordan)|Transjordan was left in a period of interregnum]]. A few months later, Abdullah, the second son of Sharif Hussein, [[Abdullah's entry into Transjordan|arrived in Transjordan]]. With the [[Transjordan memorandum]] to the [[British Mandate for Palestine]] in the early 1920s, it became the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] under the Hashemite Emir. In 1946, independent [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan]] was formed and shortly admitted to the [[United Nations]] and the [[Arab League]]. In 1948, Jordan fought with the newly born state of [[Israel]] over lands of former [[Mandatory Palestine]], effectively gaining control of the [[West Bank]] and [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|annexing]] it with its Palestinian population. [[Jordan]] lost the West Bank in the 1967 War with Israel, and since became the central base of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) in its struggle against Israel. The alliance between the PLO and the Jordanians, active during the [[War of Attrition]], came to an end in the bloody [[Black September in Jordan]] in 1970, when a civil war between Jordanians and Palestinians (with Syrian Ba'athist support) took thousands of lives. In the aftermath, the defeated PLO was forced out of Jordan together with tens of thousands of its fighters and their Palestinian families, relocating to South Lebanon.

==Stone Age==
{{Unsourced section|date=October 2020}}
{{History of the Levant}}
Evidence of human activity in [[Jordan]] dates back to the [[Paleolithic]] period. While there is no architectural evidence from this era, archaeologists have found tools, such as flint and basalt hand-axes, knives and scraping implements.

In the [[Neolithic]] period (8500–4500 BC) three major shifts occurred. First, people became [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]], living in small villages, and discovering and domesticating new food sources such as cereal grains, peas and lentils, as well as goats. The human population increased to tens of thousands.

Second, this shift in settlement patterns appears to have been catalyzed by a marked change in climate. The eastern desert, in particular, grew warmer and drier, eventually to the point where it became uninhabitable for most of the year. This watershed climate change is believed to have occurred between 6500 and 5500 BC.

Third, beginning sometime between 5500 and 4500 BC, the inhabitants began to make [[pottery]] from clay rather than plaster. Pottery-making technologies were probably introduced to the area by craftsmen from Mesopotamia.

The largest Neolithic site in Jordan is at [[Ein Ghazal]] in [[Amman]]. The many buildings were divided into three distinct districts. Houses were rectangular and had several rooms, some with plastered floors. Archaeologists have unearthed [[Plastered human skulls|skulls covered with plaster]] and with bitumen in the eye sockets at sites throughout Jordan, Israel, the [[Palestinian Territories]] and [[Syria]]. A statue discovered at Ein Ghazal is thought to be 8,000 years old. Just over one meter high, it depicts a woman with huge eyes, skinny arms, knobby knees and a detailed rendering of her toes.

==Chalcolithic==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
During the Chalcolithic period (4500–3200 BC), copper began to be smelted and used to make axes, arrowheads and hooks. The cultivation of barley, dates, olives and lentils, and the domestication of sheep and goats, rather than hunting, predominated. The lifestyle in the desert was probably very similar to that of modern [[Bedouins]].

[[Teleilat el Ghassul|Tuleitat Ghassul]] is a large Chalcolithic era village located in the [[Jordan Valley]]. The walls of its houses were made of sun-dried mud bricks; its roofs of wood, reeds and mud. Some had stone foundations, and many had large central courtyards. The walls are often painted with bright images of masked men, stars, and geometric motifs, which may have been connected to religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_ancient.html Jordan – History – Ancient Jordan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze Age==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
Many of the villages built during the Early Bronze Age (3200–1950 BC) included simple water infrastructures, as well as defensive fortifications probably designed to protect against raids by neighboring nomadic tribes.

At [[Bab al-Dhra]] in [[Wadi `Araba]], archaeologists discovered more than 20,000 shaft tombs with multiple chambers as well as houses of mud-brick containing human bones, pots, jewelry and weapons. Hundreds of [[dolmens]] scattered throughout the mountains have been dated to the late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Scheltema, H.G. (2008). ''Megalithic Jordan; an introduction and field guide''. Amman, Jordan: The American Center of Oriental Research. {{ISBN|978-9957-8543-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although writing was developed before 3000 BC in Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was generally not used in Jordan, Canaan and Syria until some thousand years later, even though archaeological evidence indicates that the inhabitants of Transjordan were trading with Egypt and Mesopotamia.

Between 2300 and 1950 BC, many of the large, fortified hilltop towns were abandoned in favor of either small, unfortified villages or a pastoral lifestyle. There is no consensus on what caused this shift, though it is thought to have been a combination of climatic and political changes that brought an end to the city-state network.

During the Middle Bronze Age (1950–1550 BC), migration across the Middle East increased. Trading continued to develop between Egypt, Syria, Arabia, and Canaan including Transjordan, resulting in the spread of technology and other hallmarks of civilization. Bronze, forged from copper and tin, enabled the production of more durable axes, knives, and other tools and weapons. Large, distinct communities seem to have arisen in northern and central Jordan, while the south was populated by a nomadic, Bedouin-type of people known as the [[Shasu]].

New fortifications appeared at sites like Amman's Citadel, [[Irbid]], and [[Tabaqat Fahl]] (or Pella). Towns were surrounded by ramparts made of earth embankments, and the slopes were covered in hard plaster, making the climb slippery and difficult. Pella was enclosed by massive walls and watch towers.

Archaeologists usually date the end of the Middle Bronze Age to about 1550 BC, when the [[Hyksos]] were driven out of Egypt during the 17th and 18th Dynasties. A number of Middle Bronze Age towns in Canaan including Transjordan were destroyed during this time.

==Iron Age==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2020}}
The most prominent Iron Age kingdoms in Transjordan were [[Ammon]], [[Moab]], and [[Edom]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5Sm7BOubDYcC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;output=html B. Mcdonald, Younker Ancient Ammon]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ammon]]ites had their capital in [[Amman|Rabbath Ammon]]. The [[Moabites]] established their kingdom in what is today the [[Kerak Governorate]] with the capital at Kir of Moab ([[Kerak]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studylight.org/dic/sbd/view.cgi?number=T2596 Smith's Bible Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kingdom of Edom was established in today's southern Jordan and southern Israel, with the capital at [[Bozrah]] in today's [[Tafilah Governorate]]. The Kingdom of Ammon maintained its independence from the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian Empire]], unlike all other kingdoms in the region which were conquered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_testament.html ''Old Testament Kingdoms of Jordan''] at kinghussein.gov.jo&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 840 BC, Mesha, the King of the Moabites, revolted against the &quot;House of [[David]]&quot;. Moab lay east of the [[Dead Sea]], about 70 kilometers south of Amman. The ensuing war is recorded in the Bible's [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] {{Bibleverse||2 Kings|3|1000|chapter 3}}. The Bible narrative is corroborated by the [[Mesha Stele]], also known as the Moabite Stone that was found in the Jordanian town of [[Dhiban]] in 1868. This find indicated that the Moabites worked with inscriptions on bluish basalt stone.

==Classical period==

[[File:Petra Jordan BW 21.JPG|thumb|right|210px|[[Petra]], the capital of the [[Nabatean kingdom]], is where the Nabatean alphabet was developed, from which the current [[Arabic alphabet]] further evolved.{{cn|date=December 2019}}]]
[[File:Ruins of a Roman temple in Erak al Amir, Jordan.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Qasr Al-Abd]], the [[Hellenistic]] palace of the [[Tobiads]] in [[Iraq al-Amir]]]]

The city of [[Salt, Jordan|Saltus]] was probably established by [[Alexander the Great]]. Later antiquity saw the rise of the [[Nabatean kingdom]] ({{Lang-ar| الأنباط}} ''Al-Anbat''){{cn|date=December 2019}} with its capital at [[Petra]], which in time became a border, client state of the [[Roman Empire]] that got absorbed into the Empire in 106 CE. During the Greco-Roman period of influence, a number of semi-independent city-states also developed in the region, grouped by general [[Pompey]] into a city-league, the [[Decapolis]], including on the territory of modern-day Jordan the cities of [[Gerasa]] ([[Jerash]]), Philadelphia (Amman), [[Abila (Decapolis)|Abila]] (probably identical with ancient [[Raphana]]; today's Quweilbeh), [[Dion, Palestine|Dion]] and [[Capitolias]] (Beit Ras; possibly the same as ancient Dion, with various identification attempts), [[Gadara]] (Umm Qays), and [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]] (Tabaqat Fahl, west of [[Irbid]]). After the Christianisation of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, historians use the term [[Byzantine Empire]] for the eastern realm. The Christian Arab tribe of the [[Ghassanids]] ruled Transjordan on behalf of the Byzantines. Many exquisite mosaic floors from churches of the Byzantine period have been unearthed, the best known containing the so-called [[Madaba Map]] of the [[Holy Land]].

==Middle Ages==
{{Unsourced section|date=October 2020}}
In the early 7th century, the area of modern Jordan became integrated into the new Arab-Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Empire]] (the first Muslim dynasty), which ruled much of the Middle East from 661 until 750 CE. At the time, Amman, today the capital of the Kingdom of Jordan, became a major town in &quot;Jund Dimashq&quot; (the military district of [[Damascus]]) and became the seat of the provincial governor. In fact, the name &quot;Al-Urdun&quot; (Jordan) was used on Umayyad post-reform copper coins beginning in the early 8th century and represent the earliest official usage of the name adopted in the 20th century for the modern state. Additionally, lead seals with the Arabic phrase &quot;Halahil Ardth Al-Urdun&quot; (Master of the Land of Jordan), dating from the late 7th to early 8th century CE, have been found in Jordan as well. Additionally, Arab-Byzantine &quot;Standing Caliph&quot; coins minted under the Umayyads also have been found bearing the mint-mark of &quot;Amman&quot;. Thus, usage of the names Al-Urdun/Jordan and Amman date back to at least the early decades of the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab-Muslim takeover of the region]].

[[File:Al Urdun Coin.jpg|right|thumb|Umayyad post-reform fals, c. 8th century]]

Under the Umayyad's successors, the [[Abbasids]] (750–1258), Jordan was neglected and began to languish due to the geopolitical shift that occurred when the Abassids moved their capital from Damascus to [[Kufa]] and later to [[Baghdad]].

After the decline of the Abbasids, parts of Jordan were ruled by various powers and empires including the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusaders]], the [[Ayyubids]], the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] as well as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who captured most of the [[Arab world]] [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517)|around 1517]].

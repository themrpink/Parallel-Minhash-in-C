In the 18th century, Britain had a huge trade deficit with [[Qing dynasty|China]]. Therefore, in 1773, the company created a British monopoly on [[opium]] buying in [[Bengal]], India, by prohibiting the licensing of opium farmers and private cultivation. The monopoly system established in 1799 continued with minimal changes until 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windle 2012 55–74&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Windle|first=James|title=Insights for Contemporary Drug Policy: A Historical Account of Opium Control in India and Pakistan|journal=Asian Journal of Criminology|year=2012|volume=7|issue=1|pages=55–74|doi=10.1007/s11417-011-9104-0|s2cid=144113092|url=http://roar.uel.ac.uk/3485/1/Windle%202012%20-%20Historical%20Account%20of%20Opium%20Control%20in%20South%20Asia%20-%20pre-print%20copy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the [[opium trade]] was illegal in China, Company ships could not carry opium to China. So the opium produced in Bengal was sold in Calcutta on condition that it be sent to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampltd.co.uk/collections_az/EIC-Factory-1/description.aspx|title=EAST INDIA COMPANY FACTORY RECORDS Sources from the British Library, LondonPart 1: China and Japan|publisher=ampltd.co.uk|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Chinese ban on opium imports, reaffirmed in 1799 by the [[Jiaqing Emperor]], the drug was smuggled into China from Bengal by traffickers and agency houses such as [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co]], [[David Sassoon &amp; Co.]], and [[Dent &amp; Co.]] in amounts averaging 900 tons a year. The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.

The company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.

[[File:A busy drying room in the opium factory at Patna, India. Lit Wellcome V0019160.jpg|200px|thumb|left|An opium factory in [[Patna]], India from c. 1850.]]In 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839–42). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the [[Treaty of Nanking]] and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windle 2012 55–74&quot; /&gt; The Jardines and [[Apcar and Company]] dominated the trade, although [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O]] also tried to take a share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=103|last=Harcourt|first=Freda|title=Flagships of Imperialism: The P &amp; O Company and the Politics of Empire from Its Origins to 1867 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmMLqQXmIkMC&amp;pg=PA103|year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-1-84779-145-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Second Opium War]] fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the [[Treaty of Tientsin]], which legalised the importation of opium. Legalisation stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey and Persia. This increased competition for the Chinese market led to India's reducing its opium output and diversifying its exports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windle 2012 55–74&quot; /&gt;

A few people wave their hats from windows in a nearby building. Monopolistic activity by the company triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]].]]

The company employed many junior clerks, known as &quot;writers&quot;, to record the details of accounting, managerial decisions, and activities related to the company, such as minutes of meetings, copies of Company orders and contracts, and filings of reports and copies of ship's logs. Several well-known British scholars and literary men had Company writerships, such as [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]] in India and [[Charles Lamb]] in England. One Indian writer of some importance in the 19th century was [[Ram Mohan Roy]], who learned English, Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, Greek, and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24, 7:38–4:33) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

=== Financial troubles ===
The company kept good financial statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Huw Bowen, &quot;East India Company: trade and domestic financial statistics, 1755–1838.&quot; ''UK Data Archive,'' [http://resources.amdigital.co.uk/eic/map/data/about.docx Data].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the company was becoming increasingly bold and ambitious in putting down resisting states, it was becoming clearer that the company was incapable of governing the vast expanse of the captured territories. The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.

At the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.

When the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].

== Indian Rebellion and disestablishment ==

[[File:&quot;Capture of the King of Delhi by Captain Hodson&quot;.jpg|thumb|Capture of the last Mughal emperor [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] and his sons by [[William Stephen Raikes Hodson|William Hodson]] in 1857]]

The Indian Rebellion of 1857 (also known as the Indian Mutiny or Sepoy Mutiny) resulted in widespread devastation in India: many condemned the East India Company for permitting the events to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=David|first1=Saul|title=The Indian Mutiny: 1857|date=4 September 2003|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-100554-6|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the Rebellion, under the provisions of the [[Government of India Act 1858]], the British Government nationalised the company. [[The Crown]] took over its Indian possessions, its administrative powers and machinery, and its [[presidency armies|armed forces]].

The company remained in existence in vestigial form, continuing to manage the tea trade on behalf of the British Government (and the supply of [[Saint Helena]]) until the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] came into effect, on 1 January 1874. This Act provided for the formal dissolution of the company on 1 June 1874, after a final dividend payment and the commutation or redemption of its stock.&lt;ref&gt;East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Vict. 17) s. 36: &quot;On the First day of June One thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, and on payment by the East India Company of all unclaimed dividends on East India Stock to such accounts as are herein-before mentioned in pursuance of the directions herein-before contained, the powers of the East India Company shall cease, and the said Company shall be dissolved.&quot; Where possible, the stock was redeemed through commutation (i.e. exchanging the stock for other securities or money) on terms agreed with the stockholders (ss. 5–8), but stockholders who did not agree to commute their holdings had their stock compulsorily redeemed on 30 April 1874 by payment of £200 for every £100 of stock held (s. 13).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' commented on 8 April 1873:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Not many days ago the House of Commons passed |newspaper=Times |location=London |date=8 April 1873 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Establishments in Britain ==
[[File:East India House by Thomas Malton the Younger.jpg|thumb|The expanded [[East India House]], London, painted by [[Thomas Malton]] in c.1800]]
The company's headquarters in London, from which much of India was governed, was [[East India House]] in [[Leadenhall Street]]. After occupying premises in [[Philpot Lane]] from 1600 to 1621; in [[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby House]], [[Bishopsgate]], from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726–1729; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796–1800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861–1862. The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].

In 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.

In 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.

[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]

The [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for &quot;writers&quot; (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].

The [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.

In 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams. The arrangement outlasted the company itself, continuing until 1870, when the India Office opened its own asylum, the [[Hanwell#Healthcare|Royal India Asylum]], at [[Hanwell]], Middlesex.&lt;ref&gt;Farrington 1976, pp. 125–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Diane K. |last1=Bolton |first2=Patricia E.

The [[East India Club]] in London was formed in 1849 for officers of the company.

== Legacy and criticisms ==
The East India Company was one of the most powerful and enduring organisations in history and had a long lasting impact on the Indian Subcontinent, with both positive and harmful effects. Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.

Once the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.

During the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, and built roads, bridges and railways. Work began in 1849 on the first railway, the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]], running for 21 miles (33.8&amp;nbsp;km) between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane).&lt;ref&gt;Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.

The increasingly large territory the company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.

Hastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales. Chantilly, VA, USA | publisher=Fisher, Professor Michael H (lecturer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hastings used [[Sanskrit]] texts for Hindus and [[Arabic]] texts for Muslims. This is still used in Pakistani and Bangladeshi courts today in civil law. Hastings also annexed lands and kingdoms and enriched himself in the process. His enemies in London used this against him to have him impeached. (See [[Impeachment of Warren Hastings]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,17:27) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales. Chantilly, VA, USA | publisher=Fisher, Professor Michael H (lecturer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Cornwallis]], widely remembered as having surrendered to [[George Washington]] following the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in 1781, replaced Hastings. Cornwallis distrusted Indians and replaced Indians with Britons. He introduced a system of personal land ownership for Indians. This change caused much conflict since most illiterate people had no idea why they suddenly became land renters from land owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,16:00) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

The Mughals, [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] and other local rulers often had to choose to fight against the company and lose everything or cooperate with the company and receive a big pension but lose their Empires or Kingdoms. The British East India Company gradually took over most of India by threat, intimidation, bribery or outright war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24, 9:27) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

The English East India Company flag changed over time, with a [[canton (flag)|canton]] based on the flag of the contemporary Kingdom, and a field of 9-to-13&amp;nbsp;alternating red and white stripes.

From 1600, the canton consisted of a [[St George's Cross]] representing the [[Kingdom of England]]. With the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the canton was changed to the new [[Evolution of UK Flag|Union Flag]]—consisting of an English St George's Cross combined with a Scottish [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's cross]]—representing the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. After the [[Acts of Union 1800]] that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly to include a [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]].

There has been much debate about the number and order of stripes in the field of the flag. Historical documents and paintings show variations from 9-to-13&amp;nbsp;stripes, with some images showing the top stripe red and others showing it white.

At the time of the American Revolution the East India Company flag was nearly identical to the [[Grand Union Flag]]. Historian [[Charles Fawcett (historian)|Charles Fawcett]] argued that the East India Company Flag inspired the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-eic2.html |title=The Striped Flag of the East India Company, and its Connexion with the American &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; |first=Charles |last=Fawcett |author-link=Charles Fawcett (historian) |editor=Rob Raeside |date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the East India Company was chartered in 1600, it was still customary for individual merchants or members of companies such as the [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Company of Merchant Adventurers]] to have a distinguishing [[merchant's mark]] which often included the mystical [[Merchant's mark#The East India Company's Merchant's Mark|&quot;Sign of Four&quot;]] and served as a trademark. The East India Company's merchant mark consisted of a &quot;Sign of Four&quot; atop a heart within which was a [[saltire]] between the lower arms of which were the initials &quot;EIC&quot;. This mark was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage&lt;ref&gt;East India Company coin 1791, half pice, as illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt; and forms the central emblem displayed on the [[Scinde Dawk]] postage stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/mjshah.geo/scinde/scinde.html|title=Scinde District Dawks|date=27 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143019/http://www.geocities.com/mjshah.geo/scinde/scinde.html|archive-date=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], the East India Company arranged for [[Letter of marque|letters of marque]] for its vessels such as ''Lord Nelson''. This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.

In addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].

At the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre César Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].

[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships. ''Earl of Mornington'' became HMS ''Drake''. Other examples include:

* {{HMS|Malabar|1804|6}}
* {{HMS|Buffalo|1813|6}}

Their design as merchant vessels meant that their performance in the warship role was underwhelming and the Navy converted them to transports.

{{Main|India Office Records}}
Unlike all other British Government records, the records from the East India Company (and its successor the [[India Office]]) are not in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] at [[Kew]], London, but are held by the [[British Library]] in London as part of the [[Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections, British Library|Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections]]. The catalogue is searchable online in the ''[[Access to Archives]]'' catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the East India Company records are freely available online under an agreement that the [[Families in British India Society]] has with the British Library. Published catalogues exist of East India Company ships' journals and logs, 1600–1834;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Catalogue of East India Company ships' journals and logs: 1600–1834 | publisher=British Library | editor-last=Farrington |editor-first=Anthony | place=London | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-7123-4646-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of some of the company's daughter institutions, including the East India Company College, Haileybury, and Addiscombe Military Seminary.&lt;ref&gt;Farrington 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

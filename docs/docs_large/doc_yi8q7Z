A dust devil is a strong, well-formed, and relatively long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide and a few metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property.

===Waterspout===
{{main|Waterspout}}

A waterspout is a columnar vortex forming over water that is, in its most common form, a non-[[supercell]] [[tornado]] over water that is connected to a [[cumuliform cloud]]. While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by [[mesocyclones]] do occur.

===Steam devil===
{{main|Steam devil}}

A gentle vortex over calm water or wet land made visible by rising water vapour.

===Fire whirl===
{{main|Fire whirl}}

A fire whirl – also colloquially known as a fire devil, fire tornado, firenado, or fire twister – is a whirlwind induced by a fire and often made up of flame or ash.

Cyclones are not unique to Earth. Cyclonic storms are common on [[gas giant|Jovian planets]], such as the [[Small Dark Spot]] on [[Neptune]]. It is about one third the diameter of the [[Great Dark Spot]] and received the nickname &quot;Wizard's Eye&quot; because it looks like an eye. This appearance is caused by a white cloud in the middle of the Wizard's Eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIZ&quot;/&gt; [[Mars]] has also exhibited cyclonic storms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brand&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=David Brand|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/May99/mars.cyclone.deb.html|title=Colossal cyclone swirling near Martian north pole is observed by Cornell-led team on Hubble telescope|accessdate=2008-06-15|date=1999-05-19|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613133949/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/May99/mars.cyclone.deb.html |archivedate = June 13, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jovian storms like the [[Great Red Spot]] are usually mistakenly named as giant hurricanes or cyclonic storms.

'''Lignite''', often referred to as '''brown coal''',&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; is a soft, brown, [[Combustion|combustible]], [[sedimentary rock]] formed from naturally compressed [[peat]]. It is considered the [[coal rank|lowest rank]] of [[coal]] due to its relatively low [[heat content]]. It has a carbon content around 25 to 35 percent.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Coal explained - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/coal/|access-date=2020-09-26|website=www.eia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mined all around the world and is used almost exclusively as a fuel for [[steam-electric power generation]]. Lignite is the most harmful coal to human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lignite coal - health effects and recommendations from the health sector |url=https://www.env-health.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/HEAL-Lignite-Briefing-en_web.pdf |publisher=Health and Environment Alliance (HEAL)|date = December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Lignite mining in Western North Dakota.jpg|thumb|left|Lignite mining, western [[North Dakota]], US (c. 1945)]]

Lignite is brownish-black in color and has a carbon content from as low as 20–25 percent up to 60–70 percent, a high [[Coal assay#Moisture|inherent moisture content]] sometimes as high as 75 percent,&lt;ref name=brit&gt;Kopp, Otto C. [http://www.britannica.com/science/lignite &quot;Lignite&quot;] in ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Coal assay#Ash|ash]] content ranging from 6–19 percent, compared with 6–12 percent for [[bituminous coal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ghassemi | first = Abbas | title = Handbook of Pollution Control and Waste Minimization | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2001 | page = 434 | isbn = 0-8247-0581-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Garzweiler surface mine, October 2018, -01.jpg|thumb|[[Strip mining]] lignite at [[Tagebau Garzweiler]] in Germany]]

The energy content of lignite ranges from 10 to 20 MJ/kg (9–17 million [[British thermal unit|BTU]] per [[short ton]]) on a moist, mineral-matter-free basis. The energy content of lignite consumed in the United States averages {{nowrap|15 MJ/kg}} (13 million BTU/ton), on the as-received basis (i.e., containing both inherent moisture and mineral matter). The energy content of lignite consumed in Victoria, Australia, averages {{nowrap|8.4 MJ/kg}} (7.3 million BTU/ton).

Lignite has a high content of volatile matter which makes it easier to convert into gas and liquid petroleum products than higher-ranking coals. Unfortunately, its high moisture content and susceptibility to [[spontaneous combustion]] can cause problems in transportation and storage. Processes which remove water from brown coal reduce the risk of spontaneous combustion to the same level as black coal, increase the calorific value of brown coal to a [[black coal equivalent]] fuel, and significantly reduce the emissions profile of 'densified' brown coal to a level similar to or better than most black coals.&lt;ref&gt;George, A.M.. State Electricity Victoria, Petrographic Report No 17. 1975; Perry, G.J and Allardice, D.J. Coal Resources Conference, NZ 1987 Proc.1, Sec. 4.. Paper R4.1&lt;/ref&gt; However, removing the moisture increases the cost of the final lignite fuel.

Because of its low [[energy density]] and typically high moisture content, brown coal is inefficient to transport and is not traded extensively on the world market compared with higher coal grades. It is often burned in power stations near the mines, such as in Australia's [[Latrobe Valley]] and [[Luminant]]'s [[Monticello Steam Electric Station|Monticello plant]] in Texas. Primarily because of latent high moisture content and low energy density of brown coal, [[carbon dioxide emissions]] from traditional brown-coal-fired plants are generally much higher per [[megawatt]] generated than for comparable black-coal plants, with the world's highest-emitting plant being [[Hazelwood Power Station]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2014, about 12 percent of [[energy in Germany|Germany's energy]] and, specifically, 27 percent of Germany's electricity came from lignite power plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Redaktion/PDF/E/energiestatistiken-energiegewinnung-energieverbrauch,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf|title=Statistics on energy production in Germany 2014, Department of Energy (in german, lignite = &quot;Braunkohle&quot;)|date=2014-10-01|accessdate=2015-12-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206115815/http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Redaktion/PDF/E/energiestatistiken-energiegewinnung-energieverbrauch,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf|archive-date=2015-12-06|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2014 in [[energy in Greece|Greece]], lignite provided about 50 percent of its power needs.

An environmentally beneficial use of lignite can be found in its use in cultivation and distribution of [[biological control]] microbes that suppress plant disease causing microbes. The carbon enriches the [[soil organic matter|organic matter in the soil]] while the biological control microbes provide an alternative to chemical pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Richard|last2=Petit|first2=R|last3=Taber|first3=R|title=Lignite and stillage:carrier and substrate for application of fungal biocontrol agents to soil|doi=10.1094/Phyto-74-1167|journal=Phytopathology|date=1984|volume=74|issue=10|pages=1167–1170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction with [[quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary amine]] forms a product called amine-treated lignite (ATL), which is used in [[drilling mud]] to reduce fluid loss during drilling.

== Geology ==
[[File:Pendeloque en lignite Marsoulas MHNT.PRE.2012.0.6.95.jpg|thumb|Pendant in lignite ([[jet (lignite)|jet]]) from the [[Magdalenian]] culture]]

Lignite begins as an accumulation of partially decayed plant material, or peat. Burial by other sediments results in increasing temperature, depending on the local geothermal gradient and tectonic setting, and increasing pressure. This causes compaction of the material and loss of some of the water and volatile matter (primarily methane and carbon dioxide). This process, called coalification, concentrates the carbon content, and thus the heat content, of the material. Deeper burial and the passage of time result in further expulsion of moisture and volatile matter, eventually transforming the material into higher-rank coals such as bituminous and anthracite coal.

Lignite deposits are typically younger than higher-ranked coals, with the majority of them having formed during the [[Tertiary]] period.

== Resources ==
[[Germany]] has the biggest deposits,&lt;ref name = &quot;BGR, 2015&quot; /&gt; followed by [[China]], [[Russia]], and [[United States]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Appunn, CEW, 2018&quot; /&gt;

===Australia===
The [[Latrobe Valley]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], contains estimated reserves of some 65 billion tonnes of brown coal.&lt;ref name=Gov&gt;Department of Primary Industries, Victorian Government, Australia, ‘Victoria Australia: A Principle Brown Coal Province’ (Fact Sheet, Department of Primary Industries, July 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit is equivalent to 25 percent of known world reserves. The coal seams are up to 98 metres thick, with multiple coal seams often giving virtually continuous brown coal thickness of up to 230 metres. Seams are covered by very little [[overburden]] (10 to 20 metres).&lt;ref name=Gov/&gt;

== Types == &lt;!--xyloid lignite, compact lignite, and perfect lignite; redirect here--&gt;

Lignite can be separated into two types. The first is xyloid lignite or [[fossil wood]] and the second form is the compact lignite or perfect lignite.

Although xyloid lignite may sometimes have the tenacity and the appearance of ordinary wood, it can be seen that the combustible woody tissue has experienced a great modification. It is reducible to a fine powder by [[trituration]], and if submitted to the action of a weak solution of [[potash]], it yields a considerable quantity of [[humic acid]].&lt;ref Name=&quot;Mackie&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Mackie | first =Samuel Joseph | title =The Geologist | publisher =Reynolds | year = 1861 | location = Original from Harvard University | pages =197–200 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=SzsFAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Xyloid+coal&amp;pg=PA199}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardite]] is an oxidized form of lignite, which also contains high levels of humic acid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oIh9_U0Fo_cC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=leonardite+humic+acid+extractable&amp;lr=&amp;ei=aeqKSvOmJ5eIyQTK-u3UDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=leonardite%20humic%20acid%20extractable&amp;f=false Tan, K.H. 2003. Humic matter in soil and the environment: principles and controversies, CRC Press, 408 pp.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jet (lignite)|Jet]] is a hardened, [[gemstone|gem-like]] form of lignite used in various types of jewelry.

__NOTOC__
Year '''423''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CDXXIII]]''') was a [[common year starting on Monday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Marinianus and Asclepiodotus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1176 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 423 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== By place ===

==== Roman Empire ====
* [[August 15]] &amp;ndash; Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], age 38, dies at [[Ravenna]] of [[Edema|dropsy]], perhaps [[pulmonary edema]]. With no children to claim the throne, [[Joannes]], ''[[Primicerius|primicerius notariorum]]'' (&quot;chief notary&quot;, head of the [[civil service]]), seizes the throne of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and is declared emperor. Among his supporters are  [[Flavius Aetius]], Roman general (''[[magister militum]]''). Joannes' rule is accepted in the [[Roman diocese|diocese]]s of [[Diocese of Gaul|Gaul]], [[Hispania]] and [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]], but not in [[Diocese of Africa|Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Sir William|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1849|publisher=C.C. Little and J. Brown|page=1211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pr8_AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1211&amp;dq=joannes+seized+throne+423#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Winter &amp;ndash; Emperor [[Theodosius II]] refuses to recognize Joannes as emperor, and prepares for [[war]]. He mobilizes an expeditionary force under command of [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardaburius]], and his son [[Aspar|Flavius Aspar]].

==== Europe ====

* The [[Pannonia]]n [[Ostrogoths]] who have been settled in [[Diocese of Thrace|Thrace]] south of the [[Danube]] (see [[421]]) by Theodosius II organize a [[farmer]]s' strike. Only payment which amounts to a huge farm loan prevents them from occupying [[Rome]].{{cn|date=July 2020}}

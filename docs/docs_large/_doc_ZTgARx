The goals of this wikiproject are: a)  to improve Wikipedia's coverage of history by creating, expanding, and maintaining history-related articles. b) to provide guidelines and recommendations for articles that describe all aspects of history. c) to serve as the central point of discussion for issues related to history in Wikipedia, d)  to maintain the [[Portal:History|history portal]] and its [[:Category:History portals|sub-portals]], e) to answer queries about history on the [[Wikipedia:Reference desk|reference desk]], especially the [[Wikipedia:Reference desk/Humanities|humanities reference desk]].

====Outline of history article====

The entire subject and Wikipedia's coverage of it is intended to be summarized in the '''[[Outline of history]]''' and its '''[[Wikipedia:Contents#History and events|branch outlines]]'''.  These are in turn is part of [[Wikipedia:Contents/Outlines|Wikipedia's outline system]] which is one of [[Wikipedia:Contents|Wikipedia's main contents systems]]. Please see the article [[Outline of history]]. Please look this over and fill-in missing topics.If Wikipedia has an article or article section about those topics, please add links to them.

While analyzing the outline, please answer the following questions (and fix the outline as needed):

*What's missing? Is the structure of the outline (sections and indents) representative of the subject? Does the outline help understand the relationships between the topics presented in the best way possible?

The overall purpose of the outline is to help readers comprehend the subject by showing what belongs to it, and within the subject what belongs to what.The outline is a taxonomy of the subject, and also serves as a table of contents and navigation aid to browse Wikipedia's articles (and article sections) about the subject.

It is also a useful tool for the WikiProject to analyze, plan, develop, and revise history-related material.  It is a hub from which to organize historical topics.

It was built as a &quot;[http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/689/1/ reverse outline]&quot;, a [[tree structure|structural model]] of an existing work, which in addition to being a summary of the work, can reveal the gaps and other weaknesses for revision purposes.Please help improve it. It's our bird's eye view.Thank you.

Most articles within [[:Category:History]] and its sub-categories are within our scope. There are already several other history projects with more specific scopes so the majority of our work is on articles that do not seem to fall into other projects' scopes. For further clarification:
*Articles with a &quot;History&quot; section, however long, ''are not'' in our scope
*&quot;History of...&quot; articles ''are'' within our scope

&lt;!--- This stats are automatically  updated  daily ---&gt;As of {{#formatdate:{{FULLDATE}}|dmy}}, there are '''{{nts|{{#expr:{{PAGESINCATEGORY:FA-Class history articles|R}}+{{PAGESINCATEGORY:FL-Class history articles|R}}+{{PAGESINCATEGORY:A-Class history articles|R}}+{{PAGESINCATEGORY:GA-Class history articles|R}}+{{PAGESINCATEGORY:B-Class history articles|R}}+{{PAGESINCATEGORY:C-Class history articles|R}}+{{PAGESINCATEGORY:Start-Class history articles|R}}+{{PAGESINCATEGORY:Stub-Class history articles|R}}+{{PAGESINCATEGORY:List-Class history articles|R}}+{{PAGESINCATEGORY:Unassessed history articles|R}}}}}}'''&lt;!--The sum of all classes stub through FA, plus lists, plus unassessed--&gt; articles within the scope of WikiProject history, of which '''{{nts|{{#expr:{{PAGESINCATEGORY:FA-Class history articles|R}}+{{PAGESINCATEGORY:FL-Class history articles|R}}}}}}''' &lt;!--FAs+FLs--&gt; are [[Wikipedia:Featured content|featured]].

The [[list of history topics]] lists of basic history topics are some articles that are in this project's scope. The latter list is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject, but rather an overview.  The [[Lists of topics]] are intended to be '''comprehensive''' and to include links to '''''every''''' article related to the subject on Wikipedia.  See [[List of mathematics topics]] and [[List of psychology topics]] as examples.

A number of lists and meta-lists are maintained in Wikipedia:
* Battles or wars should be listed in [[List of battles]] or [[War]].
* Saints should go into [[List of saints]].
* Lists of incumbents are becoming increasingly popular (see [[List of French monarchs]]; [[List of German Kings and Emperors]]); list those lists in [[Lists of incumbents]]

The '''[[list of basic history topics]]''' is intended to provide an overview of the coverage of history on Wikipedia.  It is rapidly becoming one of the best history browsing tools on Wikipedia. The '''[[List of history topics]]''' page provides a history link for every subject for which there is a list on that page, still has some redlinks. Some of those redlinks can be edited to point to existing article sections (in the main article for the corresponding subject), while the rest need articles or sections created so that they can be pointed to them.

==Project staff and working groups ==
The goal of this project is to serve as an active resource, where other editors can seek help or get questions answered, or get help with any topical efforts they may be working on. and also, at some point, we will try to resume various basic wikiproject tasks such as article assessment, working on group projects. to that end, we may create some sort of list here of active volunteers, or editors, or just anyone who can occasionally take a little time to answer questions, help with various tasks and efforts.

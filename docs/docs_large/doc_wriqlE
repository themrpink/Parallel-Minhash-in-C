== Cultural acceptance ==
In some southern Italian communities, the Mafia has a significant presence, and in these areas becoming a ''pentito'' is tantamount to a death sentence. Indeed, the Mafia family of [[Totò Riina]] based in the town of [[Corleone]] habitually extended the death sentence of the ''pentiti'' over to their relatives. For example, several of [[Tommaso Buscetta]]'s close family members were killed in a long series of murders&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bagli|first=Charles V.|date=2019-06-12|title=They Hid From the Mob for Decades. Now They Will Surface in a Film. (Published 2019)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/arts/television/tommaso-buscetta-our-godfather.html|access-date=2020-11-02|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ''pentito'' himself is physically protected by the police, retribution on his family is common; therefore, when there are rumors of a mafioso collaborating with the police, the family usually condemns that person immediately to avoid retaliation. For example, when [[Vincenzo Sinagra]] began collaborating with the authorities his entire family disowned him.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Commentary on the term ==
It is often pointed out that the correct term should be ''collaboratori di giustizia'', or &quot;collaborators with justice&quot;. The word ''pentito'' implies a moral judgment that is considered inappropriate for the courts of justice to make.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/backlash-threatens-to-silence-informers-1259236.html Backlash threatens to silence informers], The Independent, May 2, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In Italy, ''pentiti'' have come under criticism because of the favours they receive and because:
*they would invent stories to receive benefits;
*they would invent stories to persecute people they do not like;
*their employment is seen as a reward for criminals, instead of a punishment;
*They would be unreliable since they come from a criminal organization.

Criticism comes most often from politicians{{Who|date=April 2010}}, especially when they or an associate of theirs is under investigation for connections to [[the Mafia]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} It is therefore interpreted by some as an attempt to discredit one's own accusers, instead of a genuine preoccupation of the common citizen's [[civil right]]s.

[[Luciano Violante]], a politician and former president of the Italian [[Antimafia Commission]], countered that &quot;We do not find information about the Mafia among [[nun]]s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Violante, ''Non è la piovra: Dodici tesi sulle mafie italiane'' (&quot;It is not the octopus: twelve theses on Italian Mafias&quot;), [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore|Einaudi]], 1994, {{ISBN|88-06-13401-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws have been passed that bar ''pentiti'' from obtaining substantial benefits unless their revelations are later deemed new material, and lead to concrete results. There have been proposals to accept revelations only for six months, after which their revelations could not be used in court.

This has had the effect of reducing the appeal of becoming a ''pentito'' since a single mafia associate does not know whether his knowledge will be useful to the prosecutors at the time of defection. Defection from the mafia in Italy have subsequently sharply reduced from the height reached in the early nineties, and results in the fight against mafia have reduced{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} accordingly.

== History ==
[[File:Zakopane....jpg|thumb|left|A postcard of Zakopane from 1916]]
The earliest documents mentioning Zakopane date to the 17th century, describing a [[Glade (geography)|glade]] called ''Zakopisko''. In 1676 it was a village of 43 inhabitants. In 1818 Zakopane was a small town that was still being developed. There were only 340 homes that held 445 families. The population of Zakopane at that time was 1,805. 934 women and 871 men lived in Zakopane.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/zakopane/3,local-history/#footnote_2|title=Local history - Information about the town - Zakopane - Virtual Shtetl|website=www.sztetl.org.pl|language=pl|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first church was built in 1847, by Józef Stolarczyk.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Zakopane became a center for the region's [[mining]] and [[metallurgy]] industries; in the 19th century, it was the largest center for metallurgy in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. It expanded during the 19th century as the [[climate]] attracted more inhabitants. By 1889 it had developed from a small village into a climatic [[health resort]]. Rail service to Zakopane began October 1, 1899. In the late 1800s Zakopane constructed a road that went to the town of [[Nowy Targ]], and railways that came from [[Chabówka]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Because of easier transportation the population of Zakopane had increased to about 3,000 people by the end of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In the 19th century, Krupówki street was just a narrow beaten path that was meant for people to get from the central part of town to the village of Kuźnice.

The ski jump on [[Wielka Krokiew]] was opened in 1925.
The cable car to [[Kasprowy Wierch]] was completed in 1936.
The funicular connected Zakopane and the top of [[Gubałówka]] in 1938.

Because of Zakopane's popular ski mountains, the town gained popularity this made the number of tourists increase to about 60,000 people by 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In March 1940, representatives of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[NKVD]] and the [[Nazi]] [[Gestapo]] met for one week in Zakopane's Villa Tadeusz, to [[Gestapo-NKVD Conferences|coordinate the pacification of resistance in Poland]]. Throughout [[World War II]], Zakopane served as an underground staging point between Poland and [[Hungary]].{{cn|date=July 2020}}

      <text bytes="9883" xml:space="preserve">A '''syntactic category''' is a type of syntactic unit that theories of [[syntax]] assume.&lt;ref&gt;For the general reasoning behind syntactic categories, see Bach (1974:70-71) and Haegeman (1994:36).&lt;/ref&gt; Word classes, largely corresponding to traditional [[parts of speech]] (e.g. noun, verb, preposition, etc.), are syntactic categories. In [[phrase structure grammar]]s, the ''phrasal categories'' (e.g. [[noun phrase]], [[verb phrase]], [[prepositional phrase]], etc.) are also syntactic categories. [[Dependency grammar]]s, however, do not acknowledge phrasal categories (at least not in the traditional sense).

The [[Thunderbolt Siren|Federal Signal Thunderbolt series]] creates its sound by using a separate [[Fan (mechanical)|blower]] to force air through the rotor. Horns with an exponential profile then amplify the sound. Within the Thunderbolt product line, three different configurations were offered: the Thunderbolt 1000, a single-tone siren; the Thunderbolt 1000T, a dual-tone siren; and the Thunderbolt 1003, a variation of the 1000T that employs [[Solenoid valve|solenoid-actuated slide valves]] to create a &quot;hi-lo&quot; signal primarily used as a fire signal. Another example of a siren that has a separate blower is the [[Alerting Communicators of America]] (ACA) Hurricane.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

A variation on the electromechanical siren is the [[pneumatic]] {{lang|de|hochleistungssirene}} (HLS), first produced by the German firm [[Pintsch-Bamag]] and later by the German firm [[Hörmann]]. Soon afterward, Hörmann improved on the design to create the HLS 273, which did away with the massive siren head of the original in favor of a more compact head and cast aluminum exponential-profile horns. These sirens stored a reservoir of [[compressed air]], recharged periodically by a [[diesel engine]]-driven [[gas compressor|compressor]] in a vault in the base of the massive siren unit. The later HLS 273 placed the large (6,000 liter) air tank underground beside the machinery vault, instead of in the mast itself as in the earlier HLS units.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===Electronic sirens===
[[File:Alertronic High Powered Voice Siren.JPG|right|thumb|200px|American Signal AL-8000 in [[O'Fallon, Illinois]], US]]

Electronic sirens consist of an electronic [[tone generator]], a high-power [[amplifier]], and a [[horn loudspeaker]]. Typically, the loudspeaker unit incorporates horn loading, causing them to be similar in appearance to some electromechanical sirens. Many of these loudspeakers incorporate a vertical array of horns to achieve pattern control in the vertical plane. Each cell of the loudspeaker horn is driven by one or more [[compression driver]]s. One type of compression driver for this type of loudspeaker handles 400&amp;nbsp;watts of electrical power and uses two doughnut-shaped permanent magnet slugs to provide [[magnetic flux]]. For siren applications, [[high-fidelity]] sound is a secondary concern to high output, and siren drivers typically produce large amounts of [[Distortion#Audio distortion|distortion]] which would not be tolerable in an audio system where fidelity is important.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

As with electromechanical sirens, there are both omnidirectional and rotating categories, though [[Whelen Engineering]] produces sirens which oscillate through 360 degrees, rotating in one direction and then in the other to allow a hard-wired connection between the amplifiers and the siren drivers. These sirens can also be set to rotate any amount from 0 to 360 degrees, allowing sirens to broadcast only in certain directions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Examples of rotating electronic siren are the Whelen Engineering Vortex, American Signal Alertronic RE1600, and Federal Signal [[SiraTone]] 408, 612, and 812 (these designs incorporate four vertically arrayed loudspeaker cells exiting into a common manifold). This horn design accomplishes pattern control in the vertical plane and focuses the output into a high-penetration beam. Examples of omnidirectional electronic sirens are the Federal Signal EOWS1212, [[Federal Signal Modulator]] series, HSS Engineering A/S, Whelen Engineering WPS2700, WPS2800, and WPS2900, [[ATI HPSS]], and American Signal I-Force, in which compression drivers located in each cell exit into the center of the cell. The contour of each cell forms the horn.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

==Civil defense sirens around the world==

[[File:IsraeliAirRaidSiren.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A Hormann HLS F-71 Pneumatic air-raid siren in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]]. Sirens of this type are common in Israeli towns and cities, and until recently were used to warn against air raids and missile attacks.]]

===Middle East===

====Saudi Arabia====
The purpose of warnings is to notify the population of a danger that threatens their lives. Individuals must go to shelters or their homes, lock doors and windows, take appropriate protective actions, and listen through the radio and television for instructions of civil defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.998.gov.sa/English/CivilProtection/Pages/whistle_alarm.aspx|title=Whistle Alarm|website=Civil Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====The People's Republic of China====
China has sirens located in most cities and towns, particularly those located in or near [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|disputed territories]]. If the state declares a state of emergency due to attacks or invasion, or when there is a very high risk of military conflict, sirens will warn the public of possible attacks or invasion. The sirens are controlled by the [[People's Liberation Army]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

There are annual or semi-annual test runs, often occurring on commemorative dates that are associated with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. For example, [[Nanjing]] annually tests air raid sirens at 10&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 13 December, followed by a moment of silence to commemorate the [[Nanking Massacre]]. There have also been some commemorative tests during the memorial periods of major disasters, such as on 19 May 2008 in memory of victims of the [[2008 Sichuan Earthquake]].

[[File:Air_raid_alarm_in_China.ogg|thumb|right|A complete set of air raid alarms]]
The air raid warning comes in 3 types:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.henandaily.cn/content/szheng/rdyw/2016/0918/16324.html |title=今天是&quot;9·18&quot;纪念日 教你分辨三种防空警报 河南日报网 - 河南日报官方网站 |website=www.henandaily.cn |access-date=2019-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pre-raid warning: a 36-second high-tone followed by a 24-second low-tone, with three cycles per period. This warning signifies an air raid is likely about to take place.
*Raid warning: a 6-second high-tone followed by a 6-second low tone, with 15 cycles per period. This signifies that an air raid is imminent.
*Post-raid warning: a single 3-minute high-tone. When sounded, it signifies an end to the raid or a cool-down of the wartime situation.

====Taiwan====
[[File:The Alarm of TCPD Minzu Rd. Police Station 04469.jpg|thumb|A typical siren found on police stations in Taiwan, seen with loudspeakers around it. Either the yellow mechanical siren or the surrounding electronic sirens are in service.]]
Taiwanese civil defense sirens are erected on police stations, and commanded by the nation's Civil Defense Office ({{lang|zh|民防指揮管制所}}). The government issues air raid warnings, as well as tsunami warnings, through the sirens in conjunction with their own Public Warning System that utilizes 4G LTE cell signals. The Taiwanese government also holds annual air-raid drills called Wan-an drills ({{lang|zh|萬安演習}}) so the populace can be familiar with what to do in an air raid, given the high risk of war with its neighboring country, China.

====India====
[[Mumbai]] has around 200–250 functional sirens. The government is planning to change the system by incorporating modern wireless and digital technology in place of the present landline switching system.

In Mumbai civil defence, sirens were used during the Indo-Pakistan wars of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]], warning civilians about air raids by the [[Pakistan Air Force]]. At night, sirens were also used to indicate [[Blackout (wartime)|blackouts]], when all lights in Mumbai were switched off. Daily tests of the sirens at 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. were recently reduced to once per month. They are controlled by the Regional Civil Defence Control Center, Mumbai, with input from Indian Defence Services. Sirens are also used to denote a minute's worth of silence on special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-silent-sirens-may-shriek-again-under-revival-plan-2588235|title=Silent sirens may shriek again under revival plan|date=25 February 2018|website=DNA India|language=en|access-date=2019-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
[[File:ECN3000.JPG|thumb|right|200px|an electronic ECN3000 siren in [[Kfar Hess]], Israel]]

Israel has more than 3,100 warning sirens. Most of the sirens in urban areas are German-made HLS sirens, models F71 and ECN3000. All the other sirens are HPSS32 models made by Acoustic Technologies (ATI). During the early 2010s, mechanical sirens were gradually phased out and replaced by electronic ones, although the mechanical ones were generally left standing. The air-raid sirens are called {{lang|he|אזעקה}} (''az'aka'' 'alarm'), and consist of a continuous ascending and descending tone. The &quot;all clear&quot; signal, called {{lang|he|צפירת הרגעה}} (''tzfirat harga'a''), is a constant single-pitch sound. In recent conflicts, use of the &quot;all clear&quot; signal has been discontinued, as it was seen as causing unnecessary confusion and alarm. In certain regions in the south of Israel, which regularly undergo [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel|rocket attacks]] from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], a specialized system called [[Red Color]] is used.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

The &quot;all clear&quot; signal is used three times per year to denote a moment of silence (of one or two minutes): once on Israel's [[Yom HaShoah|Holocaust Remembrance Day]] and twice on the [[Yom Hazikaron|Day of Remembrance]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

====Singapore====
[[File:Public Warning Siren.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A public warning system siren in Singapore]]

[[Singapore]] currently has a network of 284 stationary sirens named the [[Public Warning System (Singapore)|Public Warning System]] which warns the entire country of air raids, as well as human-made and natural disasters (except [[Earth tremor|earth tremors]]). Singapore's sirens are tested at noon on the first day of every month. During the test, the sirens sound a light cheerful chime instead of any of the three signals. The sirens look very similar to the ECN3000 Israel version.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

====South Korea====
Nearly all towns and cities are equipped with civil defense sirens in case of natural disasters or missile attacks from North Korea. South Korea holds civil defense drills every month to prepare for such scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/world/asia/16korea.html |title=NY Times: Amid Tension, South Korea Holds Nationwide Air-Raid Drill |access-date=24 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331044258/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/world/asia/16korea.html |archive-date=31 March 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Austria====
Austria is fully covered with an operational air-raid siren system consisting of 8,203 devices as of 2012. They are tested weekly at noon on Saturdays (except in Vienna) with the {{lang|de|sirenenprobe}} signal, a 15-second continuous tone. Every year on the first Saturday of October, the whole range of alarm signals (with the exception of the fire alert) is sounded as a system test ({{lang|de|Zivilschutz-Probealarm}}) and to familiarize the population with the signals.
* Warning: a 3-minute continuous tone. People are warned of an incoming danger and advised to tune into the appropriate [[Ö2]] regional radio station or [[ORF 2]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ff-mistlberg.at/sirenensignale/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122050648/http://ff-mistlberg.at/sirenensignale/ |archive-date=22 November 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for further instructions.
* General alarm: a 1-minute ascending and descending tone. Danger is imminent; people should seek shelter immediately and listen to radio or TV.
* End of danger: a 1-minute continuous tone. The danger is over, and shelters can be left. Any hazards potentially encountered during normal life are announced in the media.
* Fire alert: three 15-second continuous tones separated by 7-second intervals. All firemen of volunteer fire brigades should report to their fire station immediately. This signal is being used less and less, as many fire brigades have begun to alert their members by radio.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

====Belgium====
Belgium used to test its air raid sirens every first Thursday of the trimester (three-month period). Sirens are Sonnenburg Electronic sirens. When the air-raid sirens are tested, the message {{lang|nl|&quot;proefsignaal&quot;}} or {{lang|fr|&quot;signal d'essai&quot;}} is broadcast every time the sirens sound. There are 540 sirens all across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brussel.be/artdet.cfm/6459 |title=Sirenetest in Brussel op 3 April 2014 - Stad Brussel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=20 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006043852/http://www.brussel.be/artdet.cfm/6459 |archive-date=6 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A non-audible test was performed every day, and the last test occurred on 4 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://crisiscentrum.be/nl/news/crisisbeheer/alarmeringstest-op-2-april-combinatie-sirenes-en-be-alert|title=Alarmeringstest op 2 april: combinatie sirenes en BE-Alert|date=25 March 2015|website=Crisiscentrum|language=nl|access-date=2019-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the network was decommissioned.

====Czech Republic====
The Czech Republic has around 6,000 sirens. They are tested every first Wednesday of the month. There are three warning signals, which are accompanied by a verbal message in Czech and usually with an English and German translation on electronic sirens. There is also an emergency broadcast on TV channels, maintained by [[Česká televize]], and radio channels, maintained by [[Český rozhlas]].

* General alert: a 140 second long fluctuating tone. The alert can be repeated up to 3 times in 3-minute intervals, and has 4 possible verbal messages:
**{{lang|cs|&quot;Všeobecná výstraha, všeobecná výstraha, všeobecná výstraha. Sledujte vysílání Českého rozhlasu, televize a regionálních rozhlasů. Všeobecná výstraha, všeobecná výstraha, všeobecná výstraha.&quot;}} The danger is unspecified and people should go inside a building, close the doors and windows (the alert usually means a dangerous element may be present in the air), and turn the TV or radio to an appropriate channel to find out more.
**{{lang|cs|&quot;Nebezpečí zátopové vlny, nebezpečí zátopové vlny. Ohrožení zátopovou vlnou. Sledujte vysílání Českého rozhlasu, televize a regionálních rozhlasů. Nebezpečí zátopové vlny, nebezpečí zátopové vlny.&quot;}} A flooding alert. People should turn on the radio and get away from the source of danger (usually a river).
**{{lang|cs|&quot;Chemická havárie, chemická havárie, chemická havárie. Ohrožení únikem škodlivin. Sledujte vysílání Českého rozhlasu, televize a regionálních rozhlasů. Chemická havárie, chemická havárie, chemická havárie.&quot;}} There was a chemical accident. People should behave the same way as during an {{lang|cs|Obecná výstraha}} message.
**{{lang|cs|&quot;Radiační havárie, radiační havárie, radiační havárie. Ohrožení únikem radioaktivních látek. Sledujte vysílání Českého rozhlasu, televize a regionálních rozhlasů. Radiační havárie, radiační havárie, radiační havárie.&quot;}} There was a radioactive accident. People should behave the same way as during an {{lang|cs|Obecná výstraha}} message.
* Testing of sirens: a 140 seconds long still tone, used to test the functionality of the sirens. {{lang|cs|&quot;Zkouška sirén, zkouška sirén, zkouška sirén. Za několik minut proběhne zkouška sirén. Zkouška sirén, zkouška sirén, zkouška sirén.&quot;}} is the verbal message before the test, and {{lang|cs|&quot;Zkouška sirén, zkouška sirén, zkouška sirén. Právě proběhla zkouška sirén. Zkouška sirén, zkouška sirén, zkouška sirén.&quot;}} is the verbal message after the test.
* Fire alert: a 60 second long still tone with a pause. It is used to alert firefighters of a fire, accompanied by this verbal message: {{lang|cs|&quot;Požární poplach, požární poplach, požární poplach. Svolání hasičů, svolání hasičů. Byl vyhlášen požární poplach. Požární poplach.&quot;}}
* All clear: There is no all clear signal, only a verbal message: {{lang|cs|&quot;Konec poplachu, konec poplachu, konec poplachu. Sledujte vysílání Českého rozhlasu, televize a regionálních rozhlasů. Konec poplachu, konec poplachu, konec poplachu.&quot;}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

====Denmark====
1,078 electronic warning sirens have been installed in Denmark by HSS Engineering. The sirens are placed on the tops of buildings or on masts. This warning system makes it possible to warn the populations of all urban areas with more than 1,000 inhabitants. This means that about 80% of Denmark's population can be warned using stationary sirens. The remaining 20% are warned by mobile sirens mounted on police cars. The function of the sirens is tested every night, but does not produce any sound. Once every year, on the first Wednesday of May at 12:00, the sirens are tested with sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://brs.dk/eng/operations/siren/about_the_warning_system/Pages/about_the_warning_system.aspx |title=Denmarks siren warning system, frome DEMA (Danish Emergency Management Agency) |access-date=21 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020415/http://brs.dk/eng/operations/siren/about_the_warning_system/Pages/about_the_warning_system.aspx |archive-date=22 March 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
A general alarm consists of a repeating 1-minute sound, made up of tones that ascend for 7 seconds and descend for 7 seconds. The end of danger is signaled by a 1-minute continuous tone. Warning sirens are tested on the first Monday of every month at noon. The testing alarm is shorter than the general alarm (only lasting for 7 or 14 seconds) and may be a flat tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pelastustoimi.fi/turvatietoa/toimi-oikein-hatatilanteessa/toiminta-yleisen-vaaramerkin-soidessa|title=Toiminta yleisen vaaramerkin soidessa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721090337/http://www.pelastustoimi.fi/turvatietoa/toimi-oikein-hatatilanteessa/toiminta-yleisen-vaaramerkin-soidessa|archive-date=21 July 2018|url-status=live|access-date=1 October 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In France, the emergency population warning network is called the [[:fr:Alerte aux populations|&quot;Réseau national d'alerte&quot;]] (RNA). The system is inherited from the air raid siren network ({{lang|fr|défense passive}}) developed before World War{{nbsp}}II. It consists of about 4,500 electronic or electromechanical sirens placed all over France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/votre_securite/en-dehors-du-domicile/sirenes/view |title=Information by the French Government |access-date=13 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025175013/http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/votre_securite/en-dehors-du-domicile/sirenes/view |archive-date=25 October 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is tested each month at noon on the first Wednesday. The most common siren type is the electromechanical KM Europ 8 port single tone siren. These sirens have a very characteristic sound: a very fast wind-up and a lower pitch than most sirens (the pitch is comparable to a STL-10 on a lower frequency resulting on a lower pitch). A recording of these sirens was used in the movie [[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

====Germany====
In Germany, the {{lang|de|Warnämter}} ('warning authorities') were closed in the 1990s after the threat of the Cold War was over, since the ability to alert the public was then considered unnecessary. As the civil defense sirens were also frequently used to alert volunteer firefighters, many sirens were sold to municipalities for a symbolic price; others were dismantled. In the 2000s, it was realized that the ability to warn the public is not only necessary in cases of war, but also in events like natural disasters, chemical or nuclear accidents, or terrorist attacks. As a result, some cities like [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Dresden]] began to rebuild their warning sirens. In [[Hamburg]], the sirens are still operational. They also warn the public during [[storm surges]]; for instance, all towns in the [[Moselle Valley]] continue to operate and test their warning sirens. The majority of operational sirens in Germany are either electric-mechanical type E57 or electronic sirens.

During World War{{nbsp}}II, Berlin's air raid sirens became known by the city's residents as &quot;Meier's trumpets&quot; or &quot;Meier's hunting horns&quot; due to [[Luftwaffe]] chief [[Hermann Goering]]'s boast that &quot;If a single bomb ever falls on Berlin, you can call me Meier!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dando-Collins|first=Stephen|title=Operation Chowhound: The Most Risky, Most Glorious US Bomber Mission of WWII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B59-BAAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4668-7915-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B59–BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Audio|Motorsirene_-_Feuerwehralarm.ogg|Audio sample of an older mechanical siren in Germany}}

====Italy====
The Italian War Ministry began installing air raid sirens and issuing air defence regulations in 1938. Production was entrusted to La Sonora, founded in 1911 and still active today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lasonora.it/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714102738/http://www.lasonora.it/ |archive-date=14 July 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War{{nbsp}}II, every town had a siren, and several were present in each large city. Even after the danger of bombings had ended, they were kept to provide warning in case of any threat (e.g. [[Acqua alta|high water]] in [[Venice]]).

As of 2015, some of them still survive. For instance, as many as 34 have been located in Rome using [[crowdsourcing]]. Up until the 1980s, they underwent routine maintenance and sounded at noon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.romasegreta.it/rubriche/sirene-antiaeree.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703034250/http://www.romasegreta.it/rubriche/sirene-antiaeree.html |archive-date=3 July 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[Protezione Civile]] (Civil Protection) operates sirens to warn the public in case of a threat to the citizen population. Protezione Civile also provides transport needs and military defence for the Government of Italy. These defence systems were put in place in the 1990s and are occasionally still used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aeromedia.it/soremgb.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233007/http://www.aeromedia.it/soremgb.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
[[File:Sirene op paal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Federal Signal Modulator 2008 electronic warning siren on a pole, as used in the Netherlands]]

The Netherlands tests its air-raid sirens once per month, on the first Monday at noon, to keep the public aware of the system. There are about 4,200 sirens placed all across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfr.nl/activiteiten/was WAS (Waarschuwingsstelsel)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215012005/http://www.lfr.nl/activiteiten/was |date=15 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2015 it was announced that, due to high maintenance costs, the sirens will be taken out of service by the end of 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/nooit-meer-sirenes-op-de-eerste-maandag-van-de-maand |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924124056/http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/nooit-meer-sirenes-op-de-eerste-maandag-van-de-maand |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has implemented a [[Cell Broadcast]] system called [[NL-Alert]], compliant to the mandatory European regulation [[EU-Alert]], to replace the sirens by 2021. However, as of late 2019, the sirens will continue to be heard until another decision has been made.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2019/11/13/besluit-over-toekomst-sirenes-in-najaar-2020 | archive-date=13 November 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

====Norway====
Norway has about 1,250 operational sirens (mostly [[Kockums]] air horn units rather than motorized sirens), primarily located in cities. Three different signals are used:

* Critical message, listen to radio: three periods of three signals, separated by one minute between the periods. The &quot;critical message&quot; signal is followed by a radio broadcast. It is used in peacetime to warn the population about major accidents, large fires and gas leaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sivilforsvaret.no/Varsling/Varslingssignaler/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201023734/http://www.sivilforsvaret.no/Varsling/Varslingssignaler/ |date=1 February 2010 }} Sivilforsvarets varslingssignaler&lt;/ref&gt;
* Air raid, take cover: an intermittent signal lasting for about a minute. 
* All clear: a continuous signal sounded for about 30 seconds. 
The sirens are tested twice each year, at noon on the second Wednesday of January and June. As of 2014, only the '&quot;critical message&quot; signal is used during tests. Previously, the signal tested in June would use the &quot;air raid&quot; and &quot;all clear&quot; signals. The latter two are no longer used in peacetime.

There are also sirens in the [[Storfjord]] area in [[Møre og Romsdal County Municipality|Møre og Romsdal]] county to warn about an avalanche from the mountain [[Åkerneset]]. These sirens are not operated by Norwegian Civil Defense department; instead, they are operated by Åksnes/Tafjord Beredskap. These sirens can be found in the villages of 
[[Stranda]], [[Tafjord]], [[Geiranger]], [[Hellesylt]], [[Linge]] and [[Valldal]].

====Romania====
In [[Romania]], civil defense sirens have been used since the early 1930s. Originally, each street had a small siren on top of a high-rise building, which could be powered mechanically. During [[Romania in World War II|World War{{nbsp}}II]], the sirens had a single continuous tone to warn of an air strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casedeepoca.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/sirena-antiaeriana-din-timpul-celui-de-al-doilea-razboi-mondial/ Air siren from the Second World War]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Cold War]], larger sirens were manufactured locally and installed on various public buildings and residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.isubotosani.ro/doc/Protectia%20Civila%20in%20Romania.pdf |title=Civil defense in Romania |access-date=12 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182718/http://www.isubotosani.ro/doc/Protectia%20Civila%20in%20Romania.pdf |archive-date=17 October 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sirens were able to transmit a comprehensive variety of tones, each with a different meaning such as a chemical disaster, an earthquake, a flood, or an imminent air or nuclear strike; each of these tones required the population to either move to higher ground or an [[Atomic, biological and chemical warfare|ABC]] shelter. An &quot;all clear&quot; signal was played after the area had been deemed safe for the general public.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Since the 1990s, civil defense sirens have been replaced by electronic sirens and the procedure has been simplified. As of 2013, there are four playable tones: a natural disaster warning, an upcoming air/nuclear strike, an imminent air/nuclear strike, and an &quot;all clear&quot; signal. Taking shelter is no longer a legal requirement, although ABC shelters are still [[Civil defense by nation#Romania|operational]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cis01.central.ucv.ro/psi/norme_mec/ce%20trebuie%20sa%20stim%20despre%20semnale%20de%20protectie%20civila.pdf |title=What we need to know about protection signals |access-date=12 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213053533/http://cis01.central.ucv.ro/psi/norme_mec/ce%20trebuie%20sa%20stim%20despre%20semnale%20de%20protectie%20civila.pdf |archive-date=13 December 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Romanian authorities started to perform monthly defence siren tests. The first such test took place on 2 August 2017 and is scheduled to be repeated on the first Wednesday of each month, between 10:00 and 11:00{{nbsp}}am local time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.igsu.ro/media/comunicate/IGSU_Exercitii_PROCIV.pdf |title=Ministry of Internal Affairs - IGSU - Press Release 83/August 1, 2017 |access-date=2 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802123546/https://www.igsu.ro/media/comunicate/IGSU_Exercitii_PROCIV.pdf |archive-date=2 August 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
During the siege of Leningrad, the radio network carried information for the population about raids and air alerts. The famous &quot;metronome&quot; went down in the history of the siege of Leningrad as a cultural monument of resistance of the population[3]

At that time , there were more than 1 thousand loudspeakers and 400 thousand radio streams operating in the city. If there were no broadcast programs, then the metronome was broadcast with a slow rhythm of 50-55 beats per minute. The network was switched on around the clock, which allowed the population and services to be confident in the operation of the network. By order of the MPVO headquarters, the duty officer of the Central station of the radio network interrupted the broadcast of the program, turned on an electric player with a record of the alarm text. This record was supplemented by 400 electric sirens. At the end of the recording, the metronome was switched on with a rapid rhythm of 160-180 beats per minute. When the danger was over, the electric player was switched on again by order of the staff , and the alarm was sounded in the streets and houses, accompanied by the sound of fanfares

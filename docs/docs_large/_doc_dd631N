In the late 1550s, Gustav's health declined. When his grave was opened in 1945, an examination of his corpse revealed that he had suffered chronic infections of a leg and in his jaw.

He gave a so-called &quot;last speech&quot; in 1560 to the chancellors, his children and other noblemen, whereby he encouraged them to remain united. On 29 September 1560, Gustav died and was buried (together with three of his wives, while only two are engraved) in the [[Uppsala Cathedral|Cathedral of Uppsala]].

==Legacy==
[[File:Gustav I of Sweden outdoor relief 2013 Stockholm Palace.jpg|thumb|left|Image of King Gustav I on a wall of [[Stockholm Palace]].]]
Gustav's legacy has been disputed. In 19th-century Swedish history a folklore developed wherein Gustav was supposed to have had many adventures when he liberated Sweden from the Danes. Today most of these stories are considered to have no other foundation than legend and skilful propaganda by Gustav himself during his time. One such story states he was staying at a close friend's farm to rest for one day during his escape from the Danish army. As he was warming himself in the common room, the Danish soldiers got a tip from one of the farm hands that Gustav was in his landlord's farm house. The Danish soldiers burst into the farm house and began searching in the common room for someone that would fit Gustav's description. As one of the soldiers came close to check Gustav Vasa, all of a sudden the landlady took out a bakery spade and started to hit Gustav and scolded him as a &quot;lazy farmboy&quot; and ordered him to go out and work. The Danish soldier found it amusing and did not realise this &quot;lazy farmboy&quot; was in fact Gustav Vasa himself who managed to slip away from danger and escape death. There are many other stories about Gustav's close encounters with death, however it is questionable if any of his adventures really did happen or were dramatised by Gustav himself; regardless of whether they happened or not, his adventures are still told to this day in Sweden.

The memory of Gustav has been honored greatly, resulting in embroidered history books, [[commemorative coin]]s, and the annual ski event [[Vasaloppet]] (the largest ski event in the world with 15,000 participants). The city of [[Vaasa]] in Finland was named after the royal house of Vasa in 1606. 18th century playwrights and librettists used his biography as the source for some of their works, including the 1739 ''Gustavus Vasa'' by [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]] (the first play banned under the [[Licensing Act 1737]], due to [[Robert Walpole]]'s belief that the play's villain was a proxy for himself) and the 1770 ''[[Gustavo primo re di Svezia]]''. The name ''Gustavus Vasa'' was also given to [[Olaudah Equiano]], a prominent African ex-[[slave]] living in Britain and involved in the struggle to abolish [[slavery]].

Gustav used to be portrayed on the 1000 [[Swedish kronor|kronor]] note, until he was replaced by [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riksbank.se/sv/Sedlar--mynt/Sedlar/Nya-sedlar/1000-kronorssedel/ The Official Swedish National Bank entry on the new 1000 SEK note&lt;/ref&gt; Gustav has been regarded by some as a power-hungry man who wished to control everything: the Church, the economy, the army and all foreign affairs. But in doing this, he also did manage to unite Sweden, a country that previously had no standardised language, and where individual provinces held a strong regional power. He also laid the foundation for Sweden's professional army that was to make Sweden into a regional superpower in the 17th century.

==Gallery==
Gustav Vasa had a series of paintings made during his reign. The originals are lost but [[watercolor|watercolour]] reproductions of unknown date remain. These paintings show Gustav's triumphs, showing what Gustav himself considered important to depict.

'''Potsdam''' ({{IPA-de|ˈpɔt͡sdam|-|De-Potsdam.ogg}}) is the capital and largest city of the [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Brandenburg]]. It directly borders the German capital, [[Berlin]], and is part of the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region]]. It is situated on the [[Havel|River Havel]] some {{convert|25|km|abbr=off}} southwest of Berlin's city centre.

Potsdam was a residence of the [[Prussia]]n kings and the [[German Emperor|German Kaiser]] until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as &quot;a picturesque, pastoral dream&quot; which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.&lt;ref&gt;''The Potsdam project, 1996'', HRH The Prince of Wales, Charles; Hanson, Brian; Steil, Lucien; Prince of Wales's Urban Design Task Force; Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture, Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture, 1998, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city lies in an area of interconnected lakes and is distinguished by a series of cultural landmarks, in particular the parks and palaces of [[Sanssouci]], the largest [[World Heritage Site]] in Germany. The [[Potsdam Conference]] in 1945 was held at [[Cecilienhof|Cecilienhof Palace]].

[[Potsdam-Babelsberg|Babelsberg]], in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]]. The [[Studio Babelsberg|Filmstudio Babelsberg]] is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.studiobabelsberg.com/en/corporate/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the [[University of Potsdam]], and more than 30 [[research institute]]s in the city.

== Geography ==
[[File:Templiner See, Vorderkappe und Hermannswerder 1.jpeg|thumb|left|The Templiner See south of Potsdam]]
The area was formed from a series of large [[moraine]]s left after the [[last glacial period]]. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.

There are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the [[Havel]], the [[Griebnitzsee]], [[Templiner See]], [[Tiefer See]], [[Jungfernsee]], Teltowkanal, [[Heiliger See]], and [[Sacrower See]]. The highest point is the {{convert|114|m|ft|0|adj=on}} high ''Kleiner Ravensberg''.

===Subdivisions===
Potsdam is divided into seven historic city ''Bezirke'' and nine new ''Stadtteile'' (villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city quarters is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.

The city of Potsdam is divided into 34 ''[[Quarter (urban subdivision)|Stadtteile]]'' (or quarters),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadtteilkatalog der Landeshauptstadt Potsdam|url=http://www.potsdam.de/cms/beitrag/10088596/513412/|access-date=2016-12-28|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are divided further into 84 statistical ''Bezirke''.

Today one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) - these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld - and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become ''Stadtteile'' - these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Groß Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadtteile|publisher=Landeshauptstadt Potsdam|url=http://www.potsdam.de/kategorie/stadtteile|access-date=2016-12-31|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new ''Stadtteile'' are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.

=== Climate ===
Officially the climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/europe/germany/brandenburg/potsdam-6406/|title=Potsdam climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Potsdam weather averages - Climate-Data.org|website=en.climate-data.org|access-date=2019-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but using the 1961-1990 normal and the 0&amp;nbsp;°C isotherm the city has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb''), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24&amp;nbsp;°C, the heat waves being influenced by the [[Urban heat island|UHI]] of Potsdam.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOAA&quot;/&gt;

The average winter high temperature is {{convert|3.5|°C}}, with a low of {{convert|-1.7|°C}}. Snow is common in the winter. Spring and autumn are short. Summers are mild, with a high of {{convert|23.6|°C}} and a low of {{convert|12.7|°C}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}&lt;!-- Probably using more recent data. --&gt;

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Potsdam&quot; originally seems to have been ''[[Potsdam#History|Poztupimi]]''. A common theory is that it derives from an old [[West Slavic languages|West Slavonic]] term meaning &quot;beneath the oaks&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.potsdam.de/cms/beitrag/10000936/33981/|title=993 – From Poztupimi to the Royal Seat|date=1 December 2004|work=potsdam.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., the corrupted ''pod dubmi/dubimi'' (''pod'' &quot;beneath&quot;, ''dub'' &quot;oak&quot;). However some question this explanation.&lt;ref name=kopish&gt;August Kopish, &quot;Die Königlichen Schlösser u.

== History ==
===Pre- and early history===

The area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the [[Bronze Age]] and was part of ''[[Magna Germania]]'' as described by [[Tacitus]]. After the [[Migration Period|great migrations]] of the Germanic peoples, [[Slav]]s moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the [[Hevelli]] tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as ''Poztupimi'', when [[Emperor Otto III]] gifted the territory to the [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], then led by his aunt [[Matilda, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Matilda]].&lt;ref name=kopish/&gt; By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its [[town charter]] in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small [[market town]] of 2,000 inhabitants.

===Early modern era===
Potsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648).

A continuous [[Hohenzollern]] possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg|Frederick William I]], [[prince-elector|Elector]] of [[Brandenburg-Prussia|Brandenburg]], the core of the powerful state that later became the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. It also housed [[Prussia]]n [[barracks]].

After the [[Edict of Potsdam]] in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from [[France]] ([[Huguenot]]s), [[Russia]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Bohemia]]. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.

Later, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]. One of these is the [[Sanssouci|Sanssouci Palace]] (French: &quot;without cares&quot;, by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]], 1744), famed for its formal gardens and [[Rococo]] interiors. Other royal residences include the [[New Palace (Potsdam)|New Palace]] and the [[Orangery Palace|Orangery]].

In 1815, at the formation of the [[Province of Brandenburg]], Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and [[Frankfurt (Oder)]].

=== Governorate of Potsdam ===
[[File:Stadt Potsdam 1852.jpg|thumb|right|Bond of Potsdam, issued 22 May 1852]]

Between 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the governorate of Potsdam ({{lang-de|[[:de:Regierungsbezirk Potsdam|Regierungsbezirk Potsdam]]}}). The ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' encompassed the former districts of [[Uckermark]], the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the [[Kurmark|Middle March]]. It was situated between [[Mecklenburg]] and the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]] on the north, and the [[Province of Saxony]] on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers [[Elbe]] and the Havel, and on the north east by the [[Oder]]. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about {{convert|20700|km2|0|abbr=out}}, divided into thirteen rural [[Kreis in Prussia|districts]], partially named after their capitals:&lt;ref name=Curtis-1839&gt;Thomas Curtis (1839).

The traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were [[Brandenburg an der Havel|Brandenburg upon Havel]], [[Köpenick]], Potsdam, [[Prenzlau]], [[Spandau]] and [[Ruppin]].&lt;ref name=Curtis-1839/&gt; Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin's municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban ''Bezirke'' within the governorate of Potsdam such as [[Charlottenburg]], [[Lichtenberg (locality)|Lichtenberg]], [[Neukölln (locality)|Rixdorf]] (after 1912 Neukölln), and [[Schöneberg]] (all of which, as well as Köpenick and Spandau, incorporated into [[Greater Berlin]] in 1920). The urban ''Bezirke'' were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban ''Bezirk''or affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):

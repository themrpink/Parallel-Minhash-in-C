You can include in your search string [[#Special characters|special characters]] and [[#Parameters|parameters]] that activate specific search capabilities. Using any of these will take you to Wikipedia's search results page with the results of your search displayed. 

The maximum search string is 300 characters long.&lt;ref name=Phabricator/&gt;

The format of the text that is entered is called [[#Search string syntax|search string syntax]].

== Search string syntax ==

Search is case insensitive, that is, upper and lowercase is ignored.

Search &quot;folds&quot; character families, matching similar-looking letters across alphabets, to match foreign terms. So, you don't have to type in [[diacritical]] letters, and your terms will still match. For example, [[Citroen]] will match [[Citroën]], and [[Aeroskobing]] matches [[Ærøskøbing]].

Characters that are not numbers or letters (punctuation marks, brackets and slashes, math and other symbols) are generally ignored. For example, &lt;kbd&gt;Credit&amp;nbsp;(finance)&lt;/kbd&gt; will return articles with the words &lt;samp&gt;credit&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;finance&lt;/samp&gt;, ignoring the parentheses, unless an article with exact title &lt;code&gt;[[Credit (finance)]]&lt;/code&gt; exists. Similarly, a search for the string &lt;kbd&gt;|LT|&lt;/kbd&gt; (letters &lt;kbd&gt;LT&lt;/kbd&gt; between two pipe symbols) will only return articles with &lt;samp&gt;lt&lt;/samp&gt;. In order to search for terms that contain non-alphanumeric characters, a [[#insource:|regex search]] must be used instead (using the \ [[escape character]] if required), for example &lt;kbd&gt;insource:/\|LT\|/&lt;/kbd&gt; will successfully return all instances of &lt;kbd&gt;|LT|&lt;/kbd&gt;.

The source text is what is searched, which is not always what is displayed on the screen. This distinction is relevant for [[Wikipedia:Piped link|piped links]], for [[Wikipedia:interlanguage link|interlanguage links]] (to find links to Chinese articles, search for &lt;kbd&gt;zh&lt;/kbd&gt;, not for &lt;kbd&gt;Zhongwen&lt;/kbd&gt;), [[Help:Special characters|special characters]] (if &lt;samp&gt;ê&lt;/samp&gt; is coded as &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;ecirc;&lt;/code&gt; it is found searching for &lt;kbd&gt;ecirc&lt;/kbd&gt;), etc. 

For [[regex]] searches, see the &lt;code&gt;[[#insource:|insource:]]&lt;/code&gt; parameter below.

=== Namespaces ===

The default search domain is the article space, but any namespace may be specified in a query. 

At the search results page, any number of [[WP:NAMESPACE|namespaces]] can be specified, and [[Wikipedia:Users|users]] can keep those namespaces as their own default search domain. Partial namespace searches can be made by specifying the initial letters of a page name.  

=== Spaces ===

The use of spaces is, in general, intuitive. Unnecessary spaces, and all non-alphanumeric characters except &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; are ignored, which makes for flexibility; it is simplest and best to avoid typing unnecessary spaces, although the tolerance for grey space simplifies copying and pasting search terms without the need for cleanup. For example, &lt;code&gt;credit card&lt;/code&gt; is obviously reasonable; copying and pasting &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Credit(?!)card]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent and convenient; &lt;code&gt;&quot;credit card&quot;&quot;payment card&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is actually correct and minimal, but &lt;code&gt;&quot;credit card&quot; &quot;payment card&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is a sensible equivalent.

Any of the following characters will be treated as a [[space character]]: &lt;code&gt;!@#$%^&amp;()_+-=~`{}[]|\:;'&lt;&gt;,.?/&lt;/code&gt;. The double quotation mark &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is not one of these characters, because it has the special purpose of specifying an exact phrase search, and &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; can be used to exclude results if either occurs at the beginning of a word or phrase (see more below). We use the term ''grey-space'' instead of ''[[Whitespace character|whitespace]]'' here to include the space character itself and all these characters. Multiple [grey-]spaces are equivalent to a single space.

Grey-space is ignored between the words of exact-phrase searches, between adjacent items in the query, and in starting characters of the search box query. All filters can have grey-space between them without affecting search results. Most operators, such as &lt;code&gt;intitle:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;incategory:&lt;/code&gt;, ignore unnecessary spaces, or grey-space, after the colon.

Where spaces are significant: single search terms cannot have embedded spaces; &lt;code&gt;work space&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&quot;work space&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;workspace&lt;/code&gt; are all different. The particular keywords ''prefix'' and ''insource'' must be followed immediately by a colon&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;and their arguments, without intervening [grey-]spaces.

=== Special characters ===
{{shortcut|H:SPCHAR}}

For [[regex]] searches, see the &lt;code&gt;[[#insource:|insource:]]&lt;/code&gt; parameter below.

==== Double quotes for exact phrase search ====
{{anchor|double quotes}}

A [[phrase]] can be matched by enclosing it in double quotes, &lt;kbd&gt;&quot;like this&quot;&lt;/kbd&gt;. Double quotes can define a single search term that contains spaces. For example, ''{{Search link|&quot;holly dolly&quot;}}'' where the space is quoted as a character, differs much from ''{{Search link|holly dolly}}'' where the space is interpreted as a logical AND.

==== Suffixed tilde character for fuzzy search ====
{{anchor|fuzzy search|respell}}&lt;!-- Please leave anchors in place. Section redirects point to them. --&gt;
{{short|H:FUZZY}}

[[Approximate string matching|Spelling relaxation]] is requested by suffixing a tilde (&lt;kbd&gt;~&lt;/kbd&gt;) like &lt;kbd&gt;this~&lt;/kbd&gt;, with results like &quot;thus&quot; and &quot;thins&quot;. It covers any two character-changes for any character except the first: it returns addition, exchange, or subtraction. This search technique is sometimes called a &quot;sounds-like&quot; search. For example, searching for ''{{search link|charlie~ parker~}}'' returns ''Charlie Parker'', ''Charles Palmer'', ''Charley Parks''.

==== Prefixed tilde character for forced search ====
{{anchor|forced search}}&lt;!-- Please leave anchors in place. Section redirects point to them. --&gt;
{{short|H:FORCE}}

To force a search rather than navigate directly to a matching page, include a tilde character &lt;kbd&gt;~&lt;/kbd&gt; anywhere in the query. It always takes you to the search results page, never jumping to a single title. For example, the misspelling &lt;kbd&gt;similiar&lt;/kbd&gt; is [[WP:Redirect|redirected]] to the [[Similarity]]&lt;!--Intentional disambiguation link.--&gt; article, but prefixing a tilde, ''{{search link|~similiar prefix:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|~similiar}}'', lists pages containing that misspelling.

==== Prefixed hyphen or exclamation point character for exclusion ====
{{anchor|exclusion|hyphen}}&lt;!-- Please leave anchors in place. Section redirects point to them. --&gt;
{{shortcut|H:EXCLUDE}} 

Pages matching a search term can be excluded by prefixing an exclamation point (!) or a hyphen or dash (&lt;kbd&gt;-&lt;/kbd&gt;) to the term. This is the [[logical NOT]]. For example, ''{{Search link|credit card -&quot;credit card&quot;}}'' finds all articles with &quot;credit&quot; and &quot;card&quot; {{em|except}} those with the phrase &quot;credit card&quot;.

==== Wildcard characters ====
{{anchor|wildcard|wildcard search}}&lt;!-- Please leave anchors in place. Section redirects point to them. --&gt;
{{shortcut|H:WLD}}

The two wildcard characters are &lt;kbd&gt;*&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;\?&lt;/kbd&gt;, and both can come in the middle or end of a word. The escaped question mark stands for one character and the star stands for any number of characters. Because many users ask questions when searching, question marks are ignored by default, and the escaped question mark (&lt;kbd&gt;\?&lt;/kbd&gt;) must be used for a wildcard.

{{clear}}

==== Non-alphabetic characters ====
For non-alphabetic characters, regex expressions are needed. See [[#insource:]] below.

==== Logical operators ====
{{shortcut|H:BOOLEAN|H:LOPS}}

The search engine supports ''limited'' boolean logic in searches. Logical &lt;kbd&gt;NOT&lt;/kbd&gt; (negation) can be indicated by a &quot;&lt;kbd&gt;-&lt;/kbd&gt;&quot; (minus sign) or a &quot;&lt;kbd&gt;!&lt;/kbd&gt;&quot; (exclamation point) character prefixed to a search term, or by the &lt;kbd&gt;NOT&lt;/kbd&gt; keyword.

Parentheses &lt;kbd&gt;(…)&lt;/kbd&gt; are ignored by the search engine and have no effect.

Search terms are implicitly joined by [[Logical conjunction|AND]]. For example &lt;code&gt;&quot;credit card&quot; housecat&lt;/code&gt; searches for pages containing both &quot;credit card&quot; and &quot;housecat&quot;. An &lt;kbd&gt;OR&lt;/kbd&gt; operator is supported, but will only give intuitive results (corresponding to [[logical disjunction]]) if ''all'' search terms are separated by &lt;kbd&gt;OR&lt;/kbd&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;red OR green OR blue&lt;/code&gt; has the expected behaviour, but &lt;code&gt;red OR green blue&lt;/code&gt; does not). &lt;kbd&gt;OR&lt;/kbd&gt; also does not behave predictably with special keywords (like &lt;code&gt;intitle:&lt;/code&gt;) or namespaces. See [[:mw:Help:CirrusSearch/Logical operators]] for a more detailed explanation.

=== Parameters ===
{{anchor|Parameter searches}}&lt;!-- Please leave anchors in place. Section redirects point to them. --&gt;
{{about|search parameters|template parameters|Help:Template#Parameters|section=yes}}
{{shortcut|H:PARAM}}

Parameters function as name filters, each followed by the search term it operates on. Their search term may be a word or a phrase. The main parameters are '''{{var|namespace}}:''', '''intitle:''', '''insource:''', '''incategory:''', and '''prefix:'''. (&quot;namespace&quot; as used here isn't literal – use the name of the actual namespace desired).

&quot;prefix:&quot; differs from the other parameters in that it can only be used at the end of a search string.

A single &quot;{{var|namespace}}:&quot; filter can go first, and a single &quot;prefix&quot; filter can go last.
&lt;!-- Note that the [[space character]]s are {{em|not}} very important except around &quot;prefix&quot;. The query string of &quot;incategory&quot; is a [[WP:Page name|page name]] (or &quot;a category name&quot;), and in a page name, the [[underscore]] is equivalent to space, and so underscore will suffice instead of the double quotes around the page name with spaces in it. The &quot;intitle&quot; query is not a page name, but it also treats space and underscore equally, treating them as AND. (It even treats multiple spaces, and even mixes of spaces and underscores that way.) All filters can have between them multiple spaces (or underscores) (or a mix) without affecting search results.  Multiple spaces are treated as a single space everywhere except around &quot;prefix&quot;. (Namely, within and around Boolean operated terms, even if inside double quotes; in between adjacent filters; in page names; in starting characters of the search box query; in between the colon and the prefix parameter names &quot;incategory&quot;, &quot;intitle&quot;, or &quot;all&quot;, or after that colon). &quot;Prefix:&quot; or a namespace name (or its alias) can have no space between its name and the following colon. And remember, &quot;prefix:&quot; is entirely literal after its colon, and so treats no space character, except as a space.--&gt;

==== {{var|namespace name}}: ====

A reader searching for articles from the search box need know nothing about namespaces, so the default [[WP:User preferences help|user preferences]] are set to search only in article space; but an advancing editor can reset the default search-space preference for the current search to a particular namespace, or &quot;all&quot; by prefixing the search with &quot;all:&quot; or the namespace name followed by a colon.

Given only at the {{em|beginning}} of the query, a namespace name followed by a colon limits search results to that namespace. It is a filter without a query string. Namespace [[WP:Namespace#Aliases|aliases]], like &quot;WP&quot; for &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, are accepted.

==== All: ====
{{shortcut|H:ALL}}

Prefixing &quot;All:&quot; to a search string, searches all namespaces, and prioritizes mainspace matches to the top.

==== all: ====

Using the lower-case &quot;all:&quot; version also searches all namespaces but does not prioritize the results by namespace.   

==== intitle: ====
{{shortcut|H:INTIT|H:INTITLE}}

[[Help:Page name|Page titles]] and redirects can be searched with &quot;intitle:{{var|query}}&quot;. The search results highlight occurrences in both the title and page content. Multiple &quot;intitle&quot; filters may be used to search for words in titles regardless of order, or possible in different titles (i.e., redirects) for the same article. [[Regular expression]]s can be used with &quot;intitle:/{{var|regexp}}/&quot; or the case insensitive &quot;intitle:/{{var|regexp}}/i&quot;. See more in the [[#insource:|insource]] section.

Following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Nordic Council began to cooperate more with the [[Baltic states]] and new Baltic Sea organisations. Sweden and Finland joined the [[European Union]] (EU), the EEC's successor, in 1995. Norway had also applied, but once again voted against membership.&lt;ref name=&quot;HM3&quot;&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 After 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120103903/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; However, Norway and Iceland did join the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) which integrated them economically with the EU. The Nordic Passport Union was also subsumed into the EU's [[Schengen Area]] in 1996.

The Nordic Council became more outward-looking, to the [[Arctic]], Baltic, Europe, and [[Canada]]. The [[Øresund Bridge]] linking Sweden and Denmark led to a large amount of cross-border travel, which in turn led to further efforts to reduce barriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;HM3&quot;/&gt; However, the initially envisioned tasks and functions of the Nordic Council have become partially dormant due to the significant overlap with the EU and EEA. In 2008 Iceland began [[Accession of Iceland to the European Union|EU membership talks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2008/11/03/further-icelandic-support-for-eu-membership/#more-4118 |title=Further Icelandic support for EU membership &amp;#124; IceNews – Daily News |publisher=Icenews.is |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but decided to annul these in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/iceland-drops-european-union-membership-bid |title=Iceland drops EU membership bid: 'interests better served outside' union |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
=== Council ===
The Nordic Council consists of 87 representatives, elected from its members' parliaments and reflecting the relative representation of the political parties in those parliaments. It holds its main session in the autumn, while a so-called &quot;theme session&quot; is arranged in the spring. Each of the national delegations has its own secretariat in the national parliament. The autonomous territories{{spaced ndash}}Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and Åland{{spaced ndash}}also have Nordic secretariats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/about-the-nordic-council|title=About the Nordic Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council does not have any formal power on its own, but each government has to implement any decisions through its national legislature. With Denmark, Norway, and Iceland being members of NATO and Finland and Sweden being [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]], the Nordic Council has not been involved in any military cooperation.

===Council of Ministers===
The original Nordic Council concentrates on inter-parliamentary cooperation. [https://web.archive.org/web/20170911010824/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers The ''Nordic Council of Ministers''], founded in 1971, is responsible for inter-governmental cooperation. Prime Ministers have ultimate responsibility but this is usually delegated to the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and the Nordic Committee for Co-operation, which co-ordinates the day-to-day work. The autonomous territories have the same representation as states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers|title=The Nordic Council of Ministers|access-date=8 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930222646/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers|archive-date=30 September 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nordic Council of Ministers has offices in the Baltic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nordic Council of Ministers' Baltic offices {{!}} Nordic cooperation|url=https://www.norden.org/en/organisation/nordic-council-ministers-baltic-offices|website=www.norden.org|access-date=2020-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secretary General ===
*[[Secretary-General of the Nordic Council]]

=== Languages ===
The Nordic Council uses the three Continental [[Scandinavian languages]] ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) as its official working languages, while interpretation and translation service is arranged for [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (but never between the Scandinavian languages).&lt;ref name=&quot;languages&quot; /&gt; The Council also publishes material in [[English language|English]] for information purposes. The Council refers to Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish collectively as Scandinavian and considers them to be different forms of the same language forming a common language community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norden&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/ |title=Norden |date=11 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1987, under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers visits to hospitals, job centres, the police, and social security offices. The languages included are Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428022430/http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6|date=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 2018, the Council established it has five official languages, giving Finnish and Icelandic equal status with Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish from 1 January 2020 onward. While the working languages of the Council's secretariat remain the three Scandinavian languages, the Council emphasised that the secretariat must include personnel with comprehensive understanding of Finnish and Icelandic as well. The then-President of the Council [[Michael Tetzschner]] thought the compromise good but also expressed concern over the change's expenses and hoped they would not increase so much that there be pressure to switch over to using English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.norden.org/sv/news/starkt-position-finskan-och-islandskan-i-nordiska-radet|title=Stärkt position för finskan och isländskan i Nordiska rådet|date=31 October 2018|access-date=4 February 2020|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.norden.org/fi/uutinen/suomen-ja-islannin-kielen-asema-vahvistuu-pohjoismaiden-neuvostossa|title=Suomen ja islannin kielen asema vahvistuu Pohjoismaiden neuvostossa|date=31 October 2018|access-date=4 February 2020|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===Language understanding===

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers have a particular focus on strengthening the Nordic language community; the main focus of their work to promote language understanding in the Nordic countries is on children and young people's understanding of written and oral Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the three mutually intelligible [[Scandinavian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/language|title=Language|website=Nordic co-operation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:Norden Copenhagen.JPG|thumb|Nordic Council headquarters in Copenhagen. White building with Norden sign and flag at street Ved Stranden No. 18]]
The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers have their headquarters in [[Copenhagen]] and various installations in each separate country, as well as many offices in neighbouring countries. The headquarters are located at [[Ved Stranden]] No. 18, close to [[Slotsholmen]].

== Members ==
&lt;!-- Do NOT add alleged &quot;observers&quot; to this section. First of all, this is a section on MEMBERS, not observers, which are two different things. Cooperation with the Baltic states belongs in the next section on such cooperation. Secondly, it has been established that the Nordic Council has no official observer status (Talk:Nordic countries). As sessions are open to the public, anyone may be present and &quot;observe&quot; the proceedings, but that doesn't make them &quot;observer members&quot; in a formal sense, like at the UN, where observer status gives many formal rights. As this article already discusses, observer status for the Baltic states was explicitly rejected, and there is no evidence presented that the council has made any other decision in this matter since (more on this on Talk:Nordic countries, where the matter was debated to death) --&gt;

The Nordic Council has 8 members or associate members, 5 sovereign states and 3 self-governing regions.

==Observer, guests and other cooperation with neighbouring countries and regions==

In accordance with § 13 of the Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council the [[Sámi Parliamentary Council]] is the only institution with observer status with the Nordic Council. In accordance with § 14, the Nordic Youth Council has the status of &quot;guest&quot; on a permanent basis, and the Presidium &quot;may invite representatives of popularly elected bodies and other persons to a session and grant them speaking rights&quot; as guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.norden.org/en/publication/rules-procedure-nordic-council-1|title=Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council|doi=10.6027/NO2020-011|isbn=9789289364799|year=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the council, &quot;within the last couple of years, guests from other international and Nordic organisations have been able to take part in the debates at the Sessions. Visitors from the Baltic States and Northwest Russia are those who mostly take up this opportunity. Guests who have a connection to the theme under discussion are invited to the Theme Session.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/information/about-sessions-nordic-council|title=About the Sessions of the Nordic Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baltic states have permanent observer status in Nordic Council organization. {{Citation needed|date=September 2020|reason=Contradictory statement; earlier citatated statements mention that only the Sami have observer status.}} Thus Nordic Council has the biggest co-operation with Baltic states and hold regular Nord - Balt prime minister summits. Baltic states see their co-operation with Nordic Council as of strategic importance and its being the primary political organizational framework within the Nord - Balt region.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020|reason=These statements lack citation.}}

The Nordic Council of Ministers has established four ''Offices outside the Nordic Region'': In [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Offices outside the Nordic Region&quot;/&gt; The offices form part of the secretariat of the Nordic Council of Ministers; according to the Council of Ministers their primary mission is to promote cooperation between the Nordic countries and the Baltic states and to promote the Nordic countries in cooperation with their embassies within the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;''Planer och budget 2016'', p. 71, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers also define [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Russia]] as &quot;Adjacent Areas&quot; and has formal cooperation with them under the Adjacent Areas policies framework; in recent years the cooperation has focused increasingly on Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tobias Etzold 2015&quot;/&gt;

The Nordic Council had historically been a strong supporter of Baltic independence from the Soviet Union. During the move towards independence in the Baltic States in 1991, Denmark and Iceland pressed for the Observer Status in the Nordic Council for the then-nonsovereign Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The move in 1991 was opposed by Norway and Finland. The move was heavily opposed by the [[Soviet Union]], accusing the Nordic Council of getting involved in its internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMUW5PR1FI8C&amp;pg=PA113|title=Diplomacy in the Former Soviet Republics|first=James P.|last=Nichol|date=23 August 1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275951924|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Nordic Council refused to give observer status for the three, at the time nonsovereign, Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMFdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157|title=Estonia: Independence and European Integration|first=David|last=Smith|date=16 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136452208|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nordic Council rejected the Baltic states' application for formal observer status, the council nevertheless has extensive cooperation on different levels with all neighbouring countries, including the Baltic states and Germany, especially the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Representatives of Schleswig-Holstein were present as informal guests during a session for the first time in 2016. The state has historical ties to Denmark and cross-border cooperation with Denmark and has a [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish minority]] population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html Schleswig-Holstein for the first time uses its observer status in the Nordic Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117110624/http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html |date=17 November 2016 }} (in German), Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 1 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As parliamentary representatives from Schleswig-Holstein, a member of the [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]] and a member of the [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|Social Democrats]] with ties to the Danish minority were elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/infothek/wahl18/drucks/4800/drucksache-18-4839.pdf Election of observational members to the Nordic Council], Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 3 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sami people|Sámi]] political structures long desired formal representation in the Nordic Council's structures, and were eventually granted observer status through the Sámi Parliamentary Council. In addition, representatives of the Sámi people are de facto included in activities touching upon their interests. In addition, the [[Faroe Islands]] have expressed their wishes for full membership in the Nordic Council instead of the current associate membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/news/faroe-islands-apply-membership-nordic-council-and-nordic-council-ministers|title=The Faroe Islands apply for membership in the Nordic Council and Nordic Council of Ministers|website=Nordic cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the members of the Nordic Council ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], and [[Finland]], all [[Member state of the European Union|EU-member states]]), the [[Baltic Assembly]], and the [[Benelux]] sought intensifying cooperation in the [[Digital Single Market]], as well as discussing social matters, the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], the [[European migrant crisis]] and defense cooperation. Relations with [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia]], [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|Turkey]] and the [[Brexit|United Kingdom]] were also on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague|title=Ratas meets with Benelux, Nordic, Baltic leaders in the Hague|date=22 June 2017|website=ERR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nordic unification ==
{{further|Scandinavism}}
 
Some desire the Nordic Council's promotion of Nordic cooperation to go much further than at present. If the states of Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland were to merge in such an integration as some desire, it would command a gross domestic product of US$1.60 trillion, making it the twelfth largest economy in the world, larger than that of Australia, Spain, Mexico, or South Korea. Gunnar Wetterberg, a Swedish historian and economist, wrote a book entered into the Nordic Council's year book that proposes the creation of a Nordic Federation from the Council in a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;Wetterberg, Gunnar (3 November 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/31188 Comment The United Nordic Federation], [[EU Observer]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Year '''388''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCLXXXVIII]]''') was a [[leap year starting on Saturday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Augustus without colleague''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1141 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 388 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

__NOTOC__
Year '''386''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCLXXXVI]]''') was a [[common year starting on Thursday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Honorius and Euodius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1139 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 386 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

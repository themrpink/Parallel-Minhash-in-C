'''Johann George III''' (20 June 1647 – 12 September 1691) was [[Elector of Saxony]] from 1680 to 1691. He belonged to the Albertine line of the [[House of Wettin]].

==Early life==
Johann Georg III was born in [[Dresden]], the only son of [[John George II, Elector of Saxony|Johann George II]] and [[Magdalene Sybille of Brandenburg-Bayreuth]].

John George succeeded his father as Elector of Saxony when he died, in 1680; he was also appointed Marshal of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Because of his courage and his enthusiasm for the War he gained the nickname of the &quot;''Saxonian [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]''&quot;.

From his childhood, he learned the typical duties and manners of an heir to the throne. That included not only a strictly Lutheran education but also language tuition and instruction in the art of fortress building and [[war]]fare.

In character he resembled his father. He shared his liking for Italian music and theatre. In 1685 John George III met the Venetian opera singer [[Margarita Salicola]] and began a relationship; he brought her to [[Dresden]] (not only to work, but also as his official mistress). She began a new era for the opera in Saxony, which had previously been dominated by the ''[[Castrato|castrati]]''. In 1686, the [[Pietism|pietist]] [[Philipp Jakob Spener]] became the [[Chaplain#Court|court chaplain]] in [[Dresden]]. But Spener was not generally accepted there and in 1691 he moved to Brandenburg.

Meanwhile, the duchy had recovered again from the consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. By 1689, Dresden had a population of 21,300 and was becoming less provincial. Four years before, in 1685, the old city of Dresden was destroyed by a fire; later, [[Wolf Caspar von Klengel]] and [[Balthasar Permoser]] were entrusted by the Duke with the reconstruction of the city in the baroque style which was the new fashion at the time.

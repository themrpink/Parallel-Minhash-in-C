The ''Sweet Thames'' line is taken from [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Prothalamion]]'' which presents a more idyllic image:

:Along the shoare of silver streaming Themmes;
:Whose rutty banke, the which his river hemmes,
:Was paynted all with variable flowers.
:And all the meads adornd with daintie gemmes
:Fit to deck maydens bowres

Also writing of the upper reaches is [[Matthew Arnold]] in ''[[The Scholar Gypsy]]'':

:Crossing the stripling Thames at Bab-lock-hythe
:Trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet
:As the slow punt swings round

:Oh born in days when wits were fresh and clear
:And life ran gaily as the sparkling Thames;
:Before this strange disease of modern life.

[[Wendy Cope]]'s poem 'After the Lunch' is set on Waterloo Bridge, beginning:

:On Waterloo Bridge, where we said our goodbyes,
:The weather conditions bring tears to my eyes.
:I wipe them away with a black woolly glove,
:And try not to notice I’ve fallen in love.

Dylan Thomas mentions the Thames in his poem &quot;A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London&quot;. &quot;London's Daughter&quot;, the subject of the poem, lays &quot;Deep with the first dead...secret by the unmourning water of the riding Thames&quot;.

Science-fiction novels make liberal use of a futuristic Thames. The utopian ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' by [[William Morris]] is mainly the account of a journey through the [[Thames valley]] in a socialist future. The Thames also features prominently in [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy, as a communications artery for the waterborne Gyptian people of Oxford and the [[Fens]], and as a prominent setting for his novel [[La Belle Sauvage]].

In ''[[The Deptford Mice]]'' trilogy by [[Robin Jarvis]], the Thames appears several times. In one book, rat characters swim through it to [[Deptford]]. Winner of the [[Nestlé Smarties Book Prize|Nestlé Children's Book Prize]] Gold Award ''[[I, Coriander]]'', by Sally Gardner is a fantasy novel in which the heroine lives on the banks of the Thames.

[[Mark Wallington (writer)|Mark Wallington]] describes a journey up the Thames in a camping skiff, in his 1989 book ''Boogie up the River'' ({{ISBN|978-0-09-965910-5}}).

=== Music ===
The [[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]] composed by [[George Frideric Handel]] premiered on 17 July 1717, when [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] requested a concert on the River Thames. The concert was performed for King George I on his barge and he is said to have enjoyed it so much that he ordered the 50 exhausted musicians to play the suites three times on the trip.

The song 'Old Father Thames' was recorded by [[Peter Dawson (bass-baritone)|Peter Dawson]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in 1933 and by [[Gracie Fields]] five years later.

[[Jessie Matthews]] sings &quot;My river&quot; in the 1938 film ''[[Sailing Along]]'', and the tune is the centrepiece of a major dance number near the end of the film.

The [[Sex Pistols]] played a concert on the ''Queen Elizabeth Riverboat'' on 7 June 1977, the Queen's Silver Jubilee year, while sailing down the river.

The choral line &quot;(I) ''(liaised)'' live by the river&quot; in the song &quot;[[London Calling]]&quot; by [[the Clash]] refers to the River Thames.

Two songs by [[the Kinks]] feature the Thames as the setting of the first song's title and, for the second song, arguably in its mention of 'the river': &quot;[[Waterloo Sunset]]&quot; is about a couple's meetings on [[Waterloo Bridge]], London and starts: &quot;Dirty old river, must you keep rolling, flowing into the night?&quot; and continues &quot;Terry meets Julie, [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo station]]&quot; and &quot;...but Terry and Julie cross over the river where they feel safe and sound...&quot;. &quot;[[See My Friends]]&quot; continually refers to the singer's friends &quot;playing 'cross the river&quot; instead of the girl who &quot;just left&quot;. Furthermore, [[Ray Davies]] as a solo artist refers to the river Thames in his &quot;London Song&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kindakinks.net/discography/showsong.php |title=Kinks Song List |publisher=Kindakinks.net |access-date=2 April 2012 |archive-date=7 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207032616/http://www.kindakinks.net/discography/showsong.php |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ewan MacColl]]'s &quot;Sweet Thames, Flow Softly&quot;, written in the early 1960s, is a tragic love ballad set on trip up the river (see [[Edmund Spenser]]'s love poem's refrain above)

English musician [[Imogen Heap]] wrote a song from the point of view of the River Thames entitled &quot;You Know Where To Find Me&quot;. The song was released in 2012 on 18 October as the sixth single from her fourth album [[Sparks (Imogen Heap album)|Sparks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imogenheap.com/tag/you-know-where-to-find-me/ You Know Where To Find Me] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017051728/http://www.imogenheap.com/tag/you-know-where-to-find-me/ |date=17 October 2012 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017051728/http://www.imogenheap.com/tag/you-know-where-to-find-me/ |date=17 October 2012 }}.

== Major flood events ==

=== London flood of 1928 ===
{{Main|1928 Thames flood}}

The [[1928 Thames flood]] was a disastrous flood of the River Thames that affected much of riverside London on 7 January 1928, as well as places further downriver. Fourteen people were drowned in London and thousands were made homeless when flood waters poured over the top of the [[Thames Embankment]] and part of the [[Chelsea Embankment]] collapsed. It was the last major flood to affect [[central London]], and, particularly following the disastrous [[North Sea flood of 1953]], helped lead to the implementation of new flood-control measures that culminated in the construction of the [[Thames Barrier]] in the 1970s.

=== Thames Valley flood of 1947 ===
{{Main|1947 Thames flood}}
The [[1947 Thames flood]] was overall the worst 20th-century flood of the River Thames, affecting much of the [[Thames Valley]] as well as elsewhere in England during the middle of March 1947 after a very [[Winter of 1946–1947|severe winter]].

The floods were caused by {{convert|4.6|in|mm}} of rainfall (including snow); the peak flow was {{convert|61.7|e9L|e9impgal|abbr=off}} of water per day and the damage cost a total of £12&amp;nbsp;million to repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/news/1721484 |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 April 2011 |archive-date=6 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206031534/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/news/1721484 |url-status=dead }} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206031534/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/news/1721484|date=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[World War II|War]] damage to some of the [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] made matters worse.

Other significant Thames floods since 1947 have occurred in 1968, 1993, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2014.

=== Canvey Island flood of 1953 ===
{{Main|Canvey Island}}

[[File:Water canvey.jpg|thumb|The flooded [[Canvey Island]] sea front, amusements and residential areas in 1953]]

On the night of 31 January, the [[North Sea flood of 1953]] devastated the island taking the lives of 58 islanders, and led to the temporary evacuation of the 13,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/weather/page/0,,2208302,00.html Canvey Island's 13,000 refugees].

Environment agency. (May Avenue Pumping Station information board).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the victims were in the holiday bungalows of the eastern Newlands estate and perished as the water reached ceiling level. The small village area of the island is approximately {{convert|2|ft|m|1|spell=in}} above sea level and consequently escaped the effects of the flood.

[[File:Epigenetic mechanisms.jpg|thumb|right|449px|Epigenetic mechanisms]]

In [[biology]], '''epigenetics''' is the study of heritable [[phenotype]] changes that do not involve alterations in the [[DNA sequence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Epigenetics 2009 review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dupont C, Armant DR, Brenner CA | title = Epigenetics: definition, mechanisms and clinical perspective | journal = Seminars in Reproductive Medicine | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 351–7 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19711245 | pmc = 2791696 | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1237423 | quote = In the original sense of this definition, epigenetics referred to all molecular pathways modulating the expression of a genotype into a particular phenotype. Over the following years, with the rapid growth of genetics, the meaning of the word has gradually narrowed. Epigenetics has been defined and today is generally accepted as 'the study of changes in gene function that are mitotically and/or meiotically heritable and that do not entail a change in DNA sequence.' }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] prefix ''[[wikt:epi-|epi-]]'' ({{wikt-lang|grc|ἐπι-}} &quot;over, outside of, around&quot;) in ''epigenetics'' implies features that are &quot;on top of&quot; or &quot;in addition to&quot; the traditional [[gene]]tic basis for inheritance.&lt;ref name = science&gt;{{cite news | title=Beware the pseudo gene genies |first = Adam|last = Rutherford| url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/19/epigenetics-dna--darwin-adam-rutherford | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=19 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetics most often involves changes that affect gene activity and [[gene expression|expression]], but the term can also be used to describe any heritable phenotypic change. Such effects on [[cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[physiology|physiological]] [[phenotypic trait]]s may result from external or [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors, or be part of normal development. The standard definition of epigenetics requires these alterations to be heritable&lt;ref name=&quot;nature2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19339683&quot; /&gt; in the progeny of either cells or organisms.

The term also refers to the changes themselves: functionally relevant changes to the genome that do not involve a change in the [[nucleotide sequence]]. Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone modification]], each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying [[DNA]] sequence. Gene expression can be controlled through the action of [[repressor protein]]s that attach to [[silencer (DNA)|silencer]] regions of the DNA. These epigenetic changes may last through [[cell division]]s for the duration of the cell's life, and may also last for multiple generations, even though they do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17522671&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird A | title = Perceptions of epigenetics | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7143 | pages = 396–8 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17522671 | doi = 10.1038/nature05913 | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..396B | s2cid = 4357965 }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's genes to behave (or &quot;express themselves&quot;) differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunter|first=Philip|date=1 May 2008|title=What genes remember|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/whatgenesremember|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501094940/http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10140|archive-date=1 May 2008|access-date=26 July 2012|website=|name-list-style=vanc|magazine=Prospect Magazine|issue=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of an epigenetic change in [[eukaryotic]] biology is the process of [[cellular differentiation]]. During [[morphogenesis]], [[totipotent]] [[stem cells]] become the various [[pluripotent]] [[cell line]]s of the [[embryo]], which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, as a single fertilized [[egg cell]] – the [[zygote]] – continues to [[mitosis|divide]], the resulting daughter cells change into all the different cell types in an organism, including [[neurons]], [[muscle cells]], [[epithelium]], [[endothelium]] of [[blood vessels]], etc., by activating some genes while inhibiting the expression of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17522676&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reik W | title = Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7143 | pages = 425–32 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17522676 | doi = 10.1038/nature05918 | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..425R | s2cid = 11794102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, some phenomena not necessarily heritable have also been described as epigenetic. For example, the term &quot;epigenetic&quot; has been used to describe any modification of chromosomal regions, especially histone modifications, whether or not these changes are heritable or associated with a phenotype. The consensus definition now requires a trait to be heritable for it to be considered epigenetic.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19339683&quot; /&gt;

A similar concept to epigenetics can be found in the study of Traditional Chinese medicine's understanding of postnatal [[Jing (Chinese medicine)|Jing]] or essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Clinical Utility of the Concept of Jing in Chinese Reproductive Medicine - General Discussion - JCM Article Archive|url=https://www.jcm.co.uk/the-clinical-utility-of-the-concept-of-jing-in-chinese-reproductive-medicine.html|access-date=2020-10-30|website=www.jcm.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The term ''epigenetics'' in its contemporary usage emerged in the 1990s, but for some years has been used with somewhat variable meanings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore_2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-developing-genome-9780199922345?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=The Developing Genome: An Introduction to Behavioral Epigenetics|last=Moore|first=David S.|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199922345|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consensus definition of the concept of ''epigenetic trait'' as a &quot;stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence&quot; was formulated at a [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harbor]] meeting in 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19339683&quot;/&gt; although alternate definitions that include non-heritable traits are still being used.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH&quot;/&gt;

The term ''epigenesis'' has a generic meaning of &quot;extra growth&quot;, and has been used in English since the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: &quot;The word is used by W. Harvey, ''Exercitationes'' 1651, p. 148, and in the ''English Anatomical Exercitations'' 1653, p. 272. It is explained to mean ‘partium super-exorientium additamentum’, ‘the additament of parts budding one out of another’.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waddington's canalisation, 1940s===

From the generic meaning, and the associated adjective ''epigenetic'', British embryologist [[C. H. Waddington]] coined the term ''epigenetics'' in 1942 as pertaining to ''[[epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]]'', in parallel to [[Valentin Haecker]]'s 'phenogenetics' ({{lang|de|Phänogenetik}}).&lt;ref name=waddington&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Waddington CH | title=The epigenotype| journal=Endeavour | volume=1 | pages=18–20 | year=1942 }}
&quot;For the purpose of a study of inheritance, the relation between phenotypes and genotypes [...] is, from a wider biological point of view, of crucial importance, since it is the kernel of the whole problem of development. Many geneticists have recognized this and attempted to discover the processes involved in the mechanism by which the genes of the genotype bring about phenotypic effects. The first step in such an enterprise is – or rather should be, since it is often omitted by those with an undue respect for the powers of reason – to describe what can be seen of the developmental processes. For enquiries of this kind, the word 'phenogenetics' was coined by Haecker [1918, {{lang|de|Phänogenetik}}]. The second and more important part of the task is to discover the causal mechanisms at work, and to relate them as far as possible to what experimental embryology has already revealed of the mechanics of development. We might use the name 'epigenetics' for such studies, thus emphasizing their relation to the concepts, so strongly favourable to the classical theory of epigenesis, which have been reached by the experimental embryologists. We certainly need to remember that between genotype and phenotype, and connecting them to each other, there lies a whole complex of developmental processes. It is convenient to have a name for this complex: 'epigenotype' seems suitable.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Epigenesis'' in the context of the biology of that period referred to the [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of cells from their initial [[totipotent]] state during [[embryonic development]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[preformationism]]'' for historical background. ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'':
&quot;the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. [...] The opposite theory was formerly known as the 'theory of evolution'; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the 'theory of preformation', sometimes as that of 'encasement' or 'emboîtement'.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

When Waddington coined the term, the physical nature of [[gene]]s and their role in heredity was not known. He used it instead as a conceptual model of how genetic components might interact with their surroundings to produce a [[phenotype]]; he used the phrase &quot;[[epigenetic landscape]]&quot; as a metaphor for [[morphogenesis|biological development]]. Waddington held that cell fates were established during development in a process he called [[canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]] much as a marble rolls down to the point of [[local optimum|lowest local elevation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Waddington2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waddington |first1=C.

In recent times, Waddington's notion of the epigenetic landscape has been rigorously formalized in the context of the [[system dynamics|systems dynamics]] state approach to the study of cell-fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alvarez-Buylla ER, Chaos A, Aldana M, Benítez M, Cortes-Poza Y, Espinosa-Soto C, Hartasánchez DA, Lotto RB, Malkin D, Escalera Santos GJ, Padilla-Longoria P | display-authors = 6 | title = Floral morphogenesis: stochastic explorations of a gene network epigenetic landscape | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = e3626 | date = 3 November 2008 | pmid = 18978941 | pmc = 2572848 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0003626 | bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.3626A | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencedirect.com&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rabajante JF, Babierra AL | title = Branching and oscillations in the epigenetic landscape of cell-fate determination | journal = Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume = 117 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 240–249 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25641423 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.01.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell-fate determination is predicted to exhibit certain dynamics, such as attractor-convergence (the attractor can be an equilibrium point, limit cycle or [[strange attractor]]) or oscillatory.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencedirect.com&quot;/&gt;

[[Robin Holliday]] defined in 1990 epigenetics as &quot;the study of the mechanisms of temporal and spatial control of gene activity during the development of complex organisms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2265224&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holliday R | title = DNA methylation and epigenetic inheritance | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 326 | issue = 1235 | pages = 329–38 | date = January 1990 | pmid = 1968668 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1990.0015 | bibcode = 1990RSPTB.326..329H | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in its broadest sense, ''epigenetic'' can be used to describe anything other than DNA sequence that influences the development of an organism.

More recent usage of the word in biology follows stricter definitions. It is, as defined by [[Arthur Riggs (geneticist)|Arthur Riggs]] and colleagues, &quot;the study of [[mitosis|mitotically]] and/or [[meiosis|meiotically]] heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-87969-490-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Riggs AD, Martienssen RA, Russo VE | title=Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation | publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location=Plainview, NY | year=1996 | pages=1–4| isbn=978-0-87969-490-6 }}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used, however, to describe processes which have not been demonstrated to be heritable, such as some forms of histone modification; there are therefore attempts to redefine &quot;epigenetics&quot; in broader terms that would avoid the constraints of requiring [[heritability]]. For example, [[Adrian Peter Bird|Adrian Bird]] defined epigenetics as &quot;the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register, signal or perpetuate altered activity states.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17522671&quot; /&gt; This definition would be inclusive of transient modifications associated with [[DNA repair]] or [[cell-cycle]] phases as well as stable changes maintained across multiple cell generations, but exclude others such as templating of membrane architecture and [[prions]] unless they impinge on chromosome function. Such redefinitions however are not universally accepted and are still subject to debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;nature2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = Language: Disputed definitions | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7216 | pages = 1023–8 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18948925 | doi = 10.1038/4551023a | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] &quot;Roadmap Epigenomics Project&quot;, ongoing as of 2016, uses the following definition: &quot;For purposes of this program, epigenetics refers to both heritable changes in gene activity and [[gene expression|expression]] (in the progeny of cells or of individuals) and also stable, long-term alterations in the transcriptional potential of a cell that are not necessarily heritable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project |url=http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/overview |title=Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a consensus definition of the epigenetic trait, a &quot;stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence&quot;, was made at a [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harbor]] meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19339683&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berger SL, Kouzarides T, Shiekhattar R, Shilatifard A | title = An operational definition of epigenetics | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 781–3 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19339683 | pmc = 3959995 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1787609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, any non-constant function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is non-measurable with respect to the trivial &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\{\emptyset,X\}&lt;/math&gt;, since the preimage of any point in the range is some proper, nonempty subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, which is not an element of the trivial &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

'''MD Data''' (standing for [[MiniDisc]] Data) is a magneto-optical medium for storing computer data. [[Sony]] wanted MD Data to replace [[floppy disk]]s, but the [[Zip drive]] from [[Iomega]] ended up filling that market need and, later on, the advent of affordable CD writers and very cheap blank CD media, coupled with the availability of memory sticks and cards proved the final straw for MD Data. 

The technology provided 140 MB of data storage, but it was slow and expensive. Also, data drives can only read or write audio MDs when set in &quot;play&quot; mode, which, however, does not provide computer access to the data.

MD Data appeared in products such as an MD still camera and an MD document scanner. MD Data was also used in the late 1990s in 4- and 8-track [[multitrack recording]] decks. Meant as a step up from the popular 4-track cassette-based studios, these recorders enjoyed a brief prominence before they were replaced by relatively affordable -- and far more flexible -- direct-to-hard drive recording on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] based computers. The format has always been hampered by the lack of an affordable MD Data drive with which to manipulate and back up data using a PC. 

In 1997, Sony introduced the MD Data2 format, which could hold 650 MB of data (as opposed to MD Data's 140 MB).  However this format was only used by Sony's DCM-M1 camcorder (capable of still images and [[MPEG-2]] video), and a few multitrack &quot;[[portastudio]]&quot;-style audio recorders such as Sony's MDM-X4 and Tascam's 564, among others.

The introduction of [[Hi-MD]] in 2004 allowed any type of data (files, music, etc.) to be stored on a Hi-MD formatted MiniDisc. This allows for storage capacity of around 340MB on a standard MiniDisc and approx. 1GB on a new, higher-density Hi-MD.

'''Galactic astronomy''' is the study of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy and all its contents. This is in contrast to [[extragalactic astronomy]], which is the study of everything outside our galaxy, including all other galaxies.

Galactic astronomy should not be confused with [[galaxy formation and evolution]], which is the general study of [[galaxy|galaxies]], their formation, structure, components, dynamics, interactions, and the range of forms they take.

The [[Milky Way]] galaxy, where the [[Solar System]] belongs, is in many ways the best studied galaxy, although important parts of it are obscured from view in visible [[wavelength]]s by regions of [[cosmic dust]]. The development of [[radio astronomy]], [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimetre astronomy]] in the 20th Century allowed the gas and dust of the Milky Way to be mapped for the first time.

In [[physical cosmology]], '''Big Bang nucleosynthesis''' (abbreviated '''BBN''', also known as '''primordial nucleosynthesis''', '''archeonucleosynthesis''', '''archonucleosynthesis''', '''protonucleosynthesis''' and '''paleonucleosynthesis''')&lt;ref name=RPP/&gt; is the production of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] other than those of the lightest [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]] ([[hydrogen-1]], &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, having a single [[proton]] as a nucleus) during the early phases of the [[Universe]]. Primordial [[nucleosynthesis]] is believed by most cosmologists to have taken place in the interval from roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the [[Big Bang]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CocVangioni2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is calculated to be responsible for the formation of most of the universe's [[helium]] as the [[Isotopes of helium|isotope]] [[helium-4]] (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He), along with small amounts of the hydrogen isotope [[deuterium]] (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H or D), the [[helium]] isotope [[helium-3]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He), and a very small amount of the [[lithium]] isotope [[lithium-7]] (&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li). In addition to these stable nuclei, two unstable or [[Radionuclide|radioactive]] isotopes were also produced: the heavy [[hydrogen]] isotope [[tritium]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H or T); and the [[beryllium]] isotope [[beryllium-7]] (&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be); but these [[Radionuclide|unstable isotopes]] later decayed into &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li, as above.

Essentially all of the elements that are heavier than lithium were created much later, by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] in evolving and exploding stars.

==Characteristics==
There are several important characteristics of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN):
* The initial conditions (neutron-proton ratio) were set in the first second after the Big Bang.
* The universe was very close to homogeneous at this time, and strongly [[radiation]]-dominated. 
* The fusion of nuclei occurred between roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang; this corresponds to the temperature range when the universe was cool enough for deuterium to survive, but hot and dense enough for [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions to occur at a significant rate.&lt;ref name=RPP&gt;{{cite journal

* It was widespread, encompassing the entire [[observable universe]].

The key parameter which allows one to calculate the effects of BBN is the baryon/photon number ratio, which is a small number of order 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;. This parameter corresponds to the baryon density and controls the rate at which nucleons collide and react; from this it is possible to calculate element abundances after nucleosynthesis ends. Although the baryon per photon ratio is important in determining element abundances, the precise value makes little difference to the overall picture. Without major changes to the Big Bang theory itself, BBN will result in mass abundances of about 75% of hydrogen-1, about 25% [[helium-4]], about 0.01% of deuterium and [[helium-3]], trace amounts (on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;) of lithium, and negligible heavier elements.  That the observed abundances in the universe are generally consistent with these abundance numbers is considered strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.

In this field, for historical reasons it is customary to quote the helium-4 fraction ''by mass'', symbol Y, so that 25% helium-4 means that helium-4 atoms account for 25% of the [[mass]], but less than 8% of the nuclei would be helium-4 nuclei. Other (trace) nuclei are usually expressed as number ratios to hydrogen. The first detailed calculations of the primordial isotopic abundances came in 1966&lt;ref name=&quot;Primordial Helium&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.16.410| title=Primeval Helium Abundance and the Primeval Fireball| journal=Physical Review Letters| volume=16| issue=10| pages=410–413| year=1966| last1=Peebles| first1=P.

The first systematic [[Monte Carlo integration|Monte Carlo]] study of how nuclear reaction rate uncertainties impact isotope predictions, over the relevant temperature range, was carried out in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Primordial Elements Monte Carlo&quot;&gt;Smith, Kawano, and Malaney.

Smith, Lawrence H. Kawano and Robert A. Malaney, The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 85:219-247, 1993 April.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Important parameters==
The creation of light elements during BBN was dependent on a number of parameters; among those was the neutron-proton ratio (calculable from [[Standard Model|Standard Model physics]]) and the baryon-photon ratio.

===Neutron–proton ratio===
The neutron-proton ratio was set by Standard Model physics before the nucleosynthesis era, 
essentially within the first 1-second after the Big Bang. 
Neutrons can react with positrons or electron neutrinos to create protons and other products in one of the following reactions:
:&lt;chem&gt;n \ + e+ &lt;=&gt; \overline{\nu}_e + p  &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;n \ + \nu_{e} &lt;=&gt; p + e- &lt;/chem&gt;

At times much earlier than 1 sec, these reactions were fast and maintained the n/p ratio close to 1:1. As the temperature dropped, the equilibrium shifted in favour of protons due to their slightly lower mass, and the n/p ratio smoothly decreased.  
These reactions continued until the decreasing temperature and density caused the reactions to become too slow, which occurred at about T = 0.7 MeV (time around 1 second) and is called the freeze out temperature. At freeze out, the neutron-proton ratio was about 1/6. However, free neutrons are unstable with a mean life of 880 sec; some neutrons decayed in the next few minutes before fusing into any nucleus, so the ratio of total neutrons to protons after nucleosynthesis ends is about 1/7.  Almost all neutrons that fused instead of decaying ended up combined into helium-4, due to the fact that helium-4 has the highest [[Nuclear binding energy|binding energy]] per nucleon among light elements. This predicts that about 8% of all atoms should be helium-4, leading to a mass fraction of helium-4 of about 25%, which is in line with observations. Small traces of deuterium and helium-3 remained as there was insufficient time and density for them to react and form helium-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baryon–photon ratio===
The baryon–photon ratio, η, is the key parameter determining the abundances of light elements after nucleosynthesis ends. Baryons and light elements can fuse in the following main reactions:
{|style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;

|
:&lt;chem&gt;p + n -&gt; ^2H + \gamma &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;p + ^2H -&gt; ^3He + \gamma &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;^2H + ^2H -&gt; ^3He + n &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;^2H + ^2H -&gt; ^3H + p &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;^3He + ^2H -&gt; ^4He + p &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;^3H + ^2H -&gt; ^4He + n &lt;/chem&gt;
|}
along with some other low-probability reactions leading to &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li or &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be. 
(An important feature is that there are no stable nuclei with mass 5 or 8, which implies that reactions adding one baryon to &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He, or fusing two &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He, do not occur). 
Most fusion chains during BBN ultimately terminate in &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He (helium-4), while &quot;incomplete&quot; reaction chains lead to small amounts of left-over &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H or &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He; the amount of these decreases with increasing baryon-photon ratio. That is, the larger the baryon-photon ratio the more reactions there will be and the more efficiently deuterium will be eventually transformed into helium-4. This result makes deuterium a very useful tool in measuring the baryon-to-photon ratio.

==Sequence==


Big Bang nucleosynthesis began roughly 10 seconds after the big bang, when the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow deuterium nuclei to survive disruption by high-energy photons. (Note that the neutron-proton freeze-out time was earlier). This time is essentially independent of dark matter content, since the universe was highly radiation dominated until much later, and this dominant component controls the temperature/time relation. At this time there were about 
six protons for every neutron, but a small fraction of the neutrons decay before fusing in the next few hundred seconds, so at the end of nucleosynthesis there are about seven protons to every neutron, and almost all the neutrons are in Helium-4 nuclei.  The sequence of these reaction chains is shown on the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Carlos A. | last=Bertulani | authorlink=Carlos Bertulani | title=Nuclei in the Cosmos | publisher=World Scientific | date=2013 | isbn=978-981-4417-66-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One feature of BBN is that the physical laws and constants that govern the behavior of matter at these energies are very well understood, and hence BBN lacks some of the speculative uncertainties that characterize earlier periods in the life of the universe. Another feature is that the process of nucleosynthesis is determined by conditions at the start of this phase of the life of the universe, and proceeds independently of what happened before.

As the universe expands, it cools. [[Free neutron]]s are less stable than helium nuclei, and the protons and neutrons have a strong tendency to form helium-4. However, forming helium-4 requires the intermediate step of forming deuterium. Before nucleosynthesis began, the temperature was high enough for many photons to have energy greater than the binding energy of deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed (a situation known as the &quot;deuterium bottleneck&quot;). Hence, the formation of helium-4 is delayed until the universe became cool enough for deuterium to survive (at about T = 0.1 MeV); after which there was a sudden burst of element formation. However, very shortly thereafter, around twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and density became too low for any significant fusion to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, and the only changes were the result of the [[radioactive]] decay of the two major unstable products of BBN, [[tritium]] and [[beryllium-7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Weiss | first = Achim | title = Equilibrium and change: The physics behind Big Bang Nucleosynthesis | url = http://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlights/BBN_phys/index.html | website = Einstein Online | accessdate = 2007-02-24 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208212219/http://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlights/BBN_phys/index.html | archivedate = 8 February 2007 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of theory===
The history of Big Bang nucleosynthesis began with the calculations of [[Ralph Alpher]] in the 1940s. Alpher published the [[Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper]] that outlined the theory of light-element production in the early universe.

During the 1970s, there was a major puzzle in that the density of baryons as calculated by Big Bang nucleosynthesis was much less than the observed mass of the universe based on measurements of galaxy rotation curves and galaxy cluster dynamics. This puzzle was resolved in large part by postulating the existence of [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freese|first=Katherine|chapter=Status of dark matter in the universe|date=2017|orig-year=1988|title=The Fourteenth Marcel Grossmann Meeting|doi=10.1142/9789813226609_0018|isbn=978-9813226593|pages=325–355|arxiv=1701.01840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavy elements===
{{Nucleosynthesis periodic table.svg}}
Big Bang nucleosynthesis produced very few nuclei of elements heavier than [[lithium]] due to a bottleneck: the absence of a stable nucleus with 8 or 5 [[nucleon]]s. This deficit of larger atoms also limited the amounts of lithium-7 produced during BBN. In [[stellar nucleosynthesis|stars]], the bottleneck is passed by triple collisions of helium-4 nuclei, producing [[carbon]] (the [[triple-alpha process]]). However, this process is very slow and requires much higher densities, taking tens of thousands of years to convert a significant amount of helium to carbon in stars, and therefore it made a negligible contribution in the minutes following the Big Bang.

The predicted abundance of CNO isotopes produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis is expected to be on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; that of H, making them essentially undetectable and negligible.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/665/1/012001|title = Primordial Nucleosynthesis|journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume = 665|pages = 012001|year = 2017|last1 = Coc|first1 = A|arxiv = 1609.06048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, none of these primordial isotopes of the elements from beryllium to oxygen have yet been detected, although those of beryllium and boron may be able to be detected in the future. So far, the only stable nuclides known experimentally to have been made before or during Big Bang nucleosynthesis are protium, deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1403.4156v1|last1 = Coc|first1 = Alain|title = Revised Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with long-lived negatively charged massive particles: Impact of new 6Li limits, primordial 9Be nucleosynthesis, and updated recombination rates|last2 = Vangioni|first2 = Elisabeth|class = astro-ph.CO|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helium-4===
{{Main|Helium-4}}
Big Bang nucleosynthesis predicts a primordial abundance of about 25% helium-4 by mass, irrespective of the initial conditions of the universe. As long as the universe was hot enough for protons and neutrons to transform into each other easily, their ratio, determined solely by their relative masses, was about 1 neutron to 7 protons (allowing for some decay of neutrons into protons). Once it was cool enough, the neutrons quickly bound with an equal number of protons to form first deuterium, then helium-4. Helium-4 is very stable and is nearly the end of this chain if it runs for only a short time, since helium neither decays nor combines easily to form heavier nuclei (since there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of 5 or 8, helium does not combine easily with either protons, or with itself). Once temperatures are lowered, out of every 16 nucleons (2 neutrons and 14 protons), 4 of these (25% of the total particles and total mass) combine quickly into one helium-4 nucleus. This produces one helium for every 12 hydrogens, resulting in a universe that is a little over 8% helium by number of atoms, and 25% helium by mass.

One analogy is to think of helium-4 as ash, and the amount of ash that one forms when one completely burns a piece of wood is insensitive to how one burns it. The resort to the BBN theory of the helium-4 abundance is necessary as there is far more helium-4 in the universe than can be explained by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. In addition, it provides an important test for the Big Bang theory. If the observed helium abundance is significantly different from 25%, then this would pose a serious challenge to the theory. This would particularly be the case if the early helium-4 abundance was much smaller than 25% because it is hard to destroy helium-4. For a few years during the mid-1990s, observations suggested that this might be the case, causing astrophysicists to talk about a Big Bang nucleosynthetic crisis, but further observations were consistent with the Big Bang theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Deuterium===

{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
Deuterium is in some ways the opposite of helium-4, in that while helium-4 is very stable and difficult to destroy, deuterium is only marginally stable and easy to destroy. The temperatures, time, and densities were sufficient to combine a substantial fraction of the deuterium nuclei to form helium-4 but insufficient to carry the process further using helium-4 in the next fusion step. BBN did not convert all of the deuterium in the universe to helium-4 due to the expansion that cooled the universe and reduced the density, and so cut that conversion short before it could proceed any further. One consequence of this is that, unlike helium-4, the amount of deuterium is very sensitive to initial conditions. The denser the initial universe was, the more deuterium would be converted to helium-4 before time ran out, and the less deuterium would remain.

There are no known post-Big Bang processes which can produce significant amounts of deuterium. Hence observations about deuterium abundance suggest that the universe is not infinitely old, which is in accordance with the Big Bang theory.

During the 1970s, there were major efforts to find processes that could produce deuterium, but those revealed ways of producing isotopes other than deuterium. The problem was that while the concentration of deuterium in the universe is consistent with the Big Bang model as a whole, it is too high to be consistent with a model that presumes that most of the universe is composed of [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s.  If one assumes that all of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, the density of the universe is such that much of the currently observed deuterium would have been burned into helium-4.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The standard explanation now used for the abundance of deuterium is that the universe does not consist mostly of baryons, but that non-baryonic matter (also known as [[dark matter]]) makes up most of the mass of the universe.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  This explanation is also consistent with calculations that show that a universe made mostly of protons and neutrons would be far more ''clumpy'' than is observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schramm|first=D.

It is very hard to come up with another process that would produce deuterium other than by nuclear fusion. Such a process would require that the temperature be hot enough to produce deuterium, but not hot enough to produce helium-4, and that this process should immediately cool to non-nuclear temperatures after no more than a few minutes. It would also be necessary for the deuterium to be swept away before it reoccurs.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Producing deuterium by fission is also difficult. The problem here again is that deuterium is very unlikely due to nuclear processes, and that collisions between atomic nuclei are likely to result either in the fusion of the nuclei, or in the release of free neutrons or [[alpha particles]]. During the 1970s, [[cosmic ray spallation]] was proposed as a source of deuterium. That theory failed to account for the abundance of deuterium, but led to explanations of the source of other light elements.

* If &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the limit superior, there are at most finitely many &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; greater than &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;; if it is less, there are infinitely many.
* If &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is less than the limit inferior, there are at most finitely many &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; less than &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;; if it is greater, there are infinitely many.

In general we have that

:&lt;math&gt;\inf_n x_n \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} x_n \leq \limsup_{n \to \infty} x_n \leq \sup_n x_n&lt;/math&gt;

The liminf and limsup of a sequence are respectively the smallest and greatest [[Limit point|cluster points]].

* For any two sequences of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\{a_n\}, \{b_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, the limit superior satisfies [[subadditivity]] whenever the right side of the inequality is defined (i.e., not &lt;math&gt;\infty - \infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\infty + \infty&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n \to \infty} (a_n + b_n) \leq \limsup_{n \to \infty}(a_n) + \limsup_{n \to \infty}(b_n).&lt;/math&gt;.

Analogously, the limit inferior satisfies [[superadditivity]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n \to \infty} (a_n + b_n) \geq \liminf_{n \to \infty}(a_n) + \liminf_{n \to \infty}(b_n).&lt;/math&gt;

In the particular case that one of the sequences actually converges, say &lt;math&gt;a_n \to a &lt;/math&gt;, then the inequalities above become equalities (with &lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n \to \infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n \to \infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; being replaced by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;).

* For any two sequences of non-negative real numbers &lt;math&gt;\{a_n\}, \{b_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, the inequalities
:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n \to \infty} (a_nb_n) \leq \biggl(\limsup_{n \to \infty}a_n \biggr) \biggl(\limsup_{n \to \infty} b_n\biggr)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n \to \infty} (a_nb_n) \geq \biggl(\liminf_{n \to \infty}a_n \biggr) \biggl(\liminf_{n \to \infty} b_n\biggr)&lt;/math&gt;
hold whenever the right-hand side is not of the form &lt;math&gt;0 \cdot \infty&lt;/math&gt;. 

If &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = A&lt;/math&gt; exists (including the case &lt;math&gt;A = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;B = \limsup_{n \to \infty} b_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n \to \infty} (a_nb_n) = AB&lt;/math&gt; provided that &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; is not of the form &lt;math&gt;0 \cdot \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Examples ====

* As an example, consider the sequence given by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = [[trigonometric function|sin]](''n''). Using the fact that [[pi]] is [[irrational number|irrational]], one can show that
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n = -1&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty} x_n = +1.&lt;/math&gt;

(This is because the sequence {1,2,3,...} is [[Equidistributed mod 1|equidistributed mod 2&amp;pi;]], a consequence of the [[Equidistribution theorem]].)

* An example from [[number theory]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}(p_{n+1}-p_n),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''n''-th [[prime number]].
The value of this limit inferior is conjectured to be 2 – this is the [[twin prime conjecture]] – but {{as of|2014|4|lc=y}} has only been proven to be less than or equal to 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bounded gaps between primes|url=http://slither.io|website=Polymath wiki|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding limit superior is &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, because there are arbitrary [[Gaps between prime numbers|gaps between consecutive primes]].

== Real-valued functions ==

Assume that a function is defined from a subset of the real numbers to the real numbers. As in the case for sequences, the limit inferior and limit superior are always well-defined if we allow the values +∞ and -∞; in fact, if both agree then the limit exists and is equal to their common value (again possibly including the infinities). For example, given ''f''(''x'') = sin(1/''x''), we have lim sup&lt;sub&gt;''x''→''0''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''(''x'') = 1 and lim inf&lt;sub&gt;''x''→''0''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''(''x'') = -1. The difference between the two is a rough measure of how &quot;wildly&quot; the function oscillates, and in observation of this fact, it is called the [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]] of ''f'' at ''0''. This idea of oscillation is sufficient to, for example, characterize [[Riemann integral|Riemann-integrable]] functions as  continuous except on a set of [[measure zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tt.lamf.uwindsor.ca/314folder/analbookfiles/RintexistLebesgue.pdf |title=Lebesgue’s Criterion for Riemann integrability (MATH314 Lecture Notes) |accessdate=2006-02-24 |url-status=dead |website=University of Windsor|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303150958/http://tt.lamf.uwindsor.ca/314folder/analbookfiles/RintexistLebesgue.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that points of nonzero oscillation (i.e., points at which ''f'' is &quot;[[pathological (mathematics)|badly behaved]]&quot;) are discontinuities which, unless they make up a set of zero, are confined to a negligible set.

== Functions from metric spaces to complete lattices ==

There is a notion of lim sup and lim inf for functions defined on a [[metric space]] whose relationship to limits of real-valued functions mirrors that of the relation between the lim sup, lim inf, and the limit of a real sequence. Take metric spaces ''X'' and ''Y'', a subspace ''E'' contained in ''X'', and a function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''E''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y''. Define, for any [[limit point]] ''a'' of ''E'',

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} ( \sup \{ f(x) : x \in E \cap B(a;\varepsilon)\setminus\{a\} \} ) &lt;/math&gt;
and

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} ( \inf \{ f(x) : x \in E \cap B(a;\varepsilon)\setminus\{a\} \} ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''B''(''a'';ε) denotes the [[Ball (mathematics)|metric ball]] of radius ε about ''a''.

Note that as ε shrinks, the supremum of the function over the ball is monotone decreasing, so we have

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{x\to a} f(x)  = \inf_{\varepsilon &gt; 0} (\sup \{ f(x) : x \in E \cap B(a;\varepsilon)\setminus\{a\} \}) &lt;/math&gt;
and similarly
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{x\to a} f(x) = \sup_{\varepsilon &gt; 0}(\inf \{ f(x) : x \in E \cap B(a;\varepsilon)\setminus\{a\} \}).&lt;/math&gt;

This finally motivates the definitions for general topological spaces. Take ''X'', ''Y'', ''E'' and ''a'' as before, but now let ''X'' and ''Y'' both be topological spaces. In this case, we replace metric balls with neighborhoods:

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{x\to a} f(x) = \inf \{ \sup \{ f(x) : x \in E \cap U\setminus\{a\} \} :  U\ \mathrm{open}, a \in U, E \cap U\setminus\{a\} \neq \emptyset  \}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{x\to a} f(x) = \sup \{ \inf \{ f(x) : x \in E \cap U\setminus\{a\} \} :  U\ \mathrm{open}, a \in U, E \cap U\setminus\{a\} \neq \emptyset  \}&lt;/math&gt;

(there is a way to write the formula using &quot;lim&quot; using nets and the neighborhood filter). This version is often useful in discussions of [[semi-continuity]] which crop up in analysis quite often. An interesting note is that this version subsumes the sequential version by considering sequences as functions from the natural numbers as a topological subspace of the extended real line, into the space (the closure of '''N''' in [−∞,∞], the [[extended real number line]], is&amp;nbsp;'''N'''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{∞}.)

== Sequences of sets ==

The [[power set]] ℘(''X'') of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is a [[complete lattice]] that is ordered by [[inclusion (set theory)|set inclusion]], and so the supremum and infimum of any set of subsets (in terms of set inclusion) always exist. In particular, every subset ''Y'' of ''X'' is bounded above by ''X'' and below by the empty set ∅ because ∅ ⊆ ''Y'' ⊆ ''X''. Hence, it is possible (and sometimes useful) to consider superior and inferior limits of sequences in ℘(''X'') (i.e., sequences of subsets of ''X'').

There are two common ways to define the limit of sequences of sets. In both cases:
* The sequence ''accumulates'' around sets of points rather than single points themselves. That is, because each element of the sequence is itself a set, there exist accumulation ''sets'' that are somehow nearby to infinitely many elements of the sequence.
* The supremum/superior/outer limit is a set that [[join (mathematics)|join]]s these accumulation sets together. That is, it is the union of all of the accumulation sets. When ordering by set inclusion, the supremum limit is the least upper bound on the set of accumulation points because it ''contains'' each of them. Hence, it is the supremum of the limit points.
* The infimum/inferior/inner limit is a set where all of these accumulation sets [[meet (mathematics)|meet]]. That is, it is the intersection of all of the accumulation sets. When ordering by set inclusion, the infimum limit is the greatest lower bound on the set of accumulation points because it is ''contained in'' each of them. Hence, it is the infimum of the limit points.
* Because ordering is by set inclusion, then the outer limit will always contain the inner limit (i.e., lim&amp;nbsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). Hence, when considering the convergence of a sequence of sets, it generally suffices to consider the convergence of the outer limit of that sequence.
The difference between the two definitions involves how the [[topology]] (i.e., how to quantify separation) is defined. In fact, the second definition is identical to the first when the [[discrete metric]] is used to induce the topology on ''X''.

===General set convergence===
{{anchor}}
In this case, a sequence of sets approaches a limiting set when the elements of each member of the sequence approach the elements of the limiting set. In particular, if {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a sequence of subsets of ''X'', then:
* lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also called the '''outer limit''', consists of those elements which are limits of points in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; taken from [[countably infinite|(countably) infinite]]ly many ''n''. That is, ''x'' ∈ lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if there exists a sequence of points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and a ''subsequence'' {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;} of {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} such that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''x'' as ''k'' → ∞.
* lim&amp;nbsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also called the '''inner limit''', consists of those elements which are limits of points in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all but finitely many ''n'' (i.e., [[cofinitely]] many ''n''). That is, ''x'' ∈ lim&amp;nbsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if there exists a ''sequence'' of points {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} such that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''x'' as ''k'' → ∞.
The limit lim&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; exists if and only if lim&amp;nbsp;inf ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and lim&amp;nbsp;sup ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; agree, in which case lim&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = lim&amp;nbsp;sup ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = lim&amp;nbsp;inf ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSTeel09&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

===Special case: discrete metric===
This is the definition used in [[measure theory]] and [[probability]]. Further discussion and examples from the set-theoretic point of view, as opposed to the topological point of view discussed below, are at [[set-theoretic limit]].

By this definition, a sequence of sets approaches a limiting set when the limiting set includes elements which are in all except finitely many sets of the sequence ''and'' does not include elements which are in all except finitely many complements of sets of the sequence. That is, this case specializes the general definition when the topology on set ''X'' is induced from the [[discrete metric]].

Specifically, for points ''x'' ∈ ''X'' and ''y'' ∈ ''X'', the discrete metric is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) := \begin{cases} 0 &amp;\text{if } x = y,\\ 1 &amp;\text{if } x \neq y, \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
under which a sequence of points {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} converges to point ''x'' ∈ ''X'' if and only if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x'' for all except finitely many ''k''. Therefore, ''if the limit set exists'' it contains the points and only the points which are in all except finitely many of the sets of the sequence. Since convergence in the discrete metric is the strictest form of convergence (i.e., requires the most), this definition of a limit set is the strictest possible.

If {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a sequence of subsets of ''X'', then the following always exist:
* lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of elements of ''X'' which belong to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for '''infinitely many''' ''n'' (see [[countably infinite]]). That is, ''x'' ∈ lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if there exists a subsequence {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;} of {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} such that ''x'' ∈ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''k''.
* lim&amp;nbsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of elements of ''X'' which belong to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for '''all except finitely many''' ''n'' (i.e., for [[cofinitely]] many ''n''). That is, ''x'' ∈ lim&amp;nbsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if there exists some ''m''&gt;0 such that ''x'' ∈ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n''&gt;''m''.
Observe that ''x'' ∈ lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''x'' ∉ lim&amp;nbsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The lim&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; exists if and only if lim&amp;nbsp;inf ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and lim&amp;nbsp;sup ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; agree, in which case lim&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = lim&amp;nbsp;sup ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = lim&amp;nbsp;inf ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
In this sense, the sequence has a limit so long as every point in ''X'' either appears in all except finitely many ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or appears in all except finitely many ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;.

Using the standard parlance of set theory, [[inclusion (set theory)|set inclusion]] provides a [[partially ordered sets|partial ordering]] on the collection of all subsets of ''X'' that allows [[intersection (set theory)|set intersection]] to generate a greatest lower bound and [[union (set theory)|set union]] to generate a least upper bound. Thus, the infimum or [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] of a collection of subsets is the greatest lower bound while the supremum or [[join (mathematics)|join]] is the least upper bound.  In this context, the inner limit, lim&amp;nbsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, is the '''largest meeting of tails''' of the sequence, and the outer limit, lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, is the '''smallest joining of tails''' of the sequence. The following makes this precise. 
*Let ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the meet of the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; tail of the sequence. That is,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}I_n 
&amp;= \inf \{ X_m : m \in \{n, n+1, n+2, \ldots\}\}\\
&amp;= \bigcap_{m=n}^{\infty} X_m = X_n \cap X_{n+1} \cap X_{n+2} \cap \cdots.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:The sequence {''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} is non-decreasing (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sube; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) because each ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is the intersection of fewer sets than ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The least upper bound on this sequence of meets of tails is 
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\liminf_{n\to\infty}X_n 
&amp;= \sup\{\inf\{X_m: m \in \{n, n+1, \ldots\}\}: n \in \{1,2,\dots\}\}\\
&amp;= {\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty}\left({\bigcap_{m=n}^\infty}X_m\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:So the limit infimum contains all subsets which are lower bounds for all except finitely many sets of the sequence.

*Similarly, let ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the join of the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; tail of the sequence. That is,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}J_n 
&amp;= \sup \{ X_m : m \in \{n, n+1, n+2, \ldots\}\}\\ 
&amp;= \bigcup_{m=n}^{\infty} X_m = X_n \cup X_{n+1} \cup X_{n+2} \cup \cdots.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:The sequence {''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} is non-increasing (''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊇ ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) because each ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is the union of fewer sets than ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The greatest lower bound on this sequence of joins of tails is 
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\limsup_{n\to\infty}X_n 
&amp;= \inf\{\sup\{X_m: m \in \{n, n+1, \ldots\}\}: n \in \{1,2,\dots\}\}\\
&amp;= {\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty}\left({\bigcup_{m=n}^\infty}X_m\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:So the limit supremum is contained in all subsets which are upper bounds for all except finitely many sets of the sequence.

===Examples===

The following are several set convergence examples. They have been broken into sections with respect to the metric used to induce the topology on set ''X''.

; Using the [[discrete metric]]

* The [[Borel–Cantelli lemma]] is an example application of these constructs.

; Using either the discrete metric or the [[Euclidean metric]]

* Consider the set ''X'' = {0,1} and the sequence of subsets:
::&lt;math&gt;\{X_n\} = \{ \{0\},\{1\},\{0\},\{1\},\{0\},\{1\},\dots \}.&lt;/math&gt;
:The &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot; elements of this sequence form two subsequences, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;0},{0},{0},...} and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;1},{1},{1},...}, which have limit points 0 and 1, respectively, and so the outer or superior limit is the set {0,1} of these two points. However, there are no limit points that can be taken from the {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} sequence as a whole, and so the interior or inferior limit is the empty set {}. That is,
:* lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = {0,1}
:* lim&amp;nbsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = {}
:However, for {''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} = &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;0},{0},{0},...} and {''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} = &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;1},{1},{1},...}:
:* lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = lim&amp;nbsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = lim&amp;nbsp;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = {0}
:* lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = lim&amp;nbsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = lim&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = {1}

* Consider the set ''X'' = {50, 20, -100, -25, 0, 1} and the sequence of subsets:
::&lt;math&gt;\{X_n\} = \{ \{50\}, \{20\}, \{-100\}, \{-25\}, \{0\},\{1\},\{0\},\{1\},\{0\},\{1\},\dots \}.&lt;/math&gt;
:As in the previous two examples,
:* lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = {0,1}
:* lim&amp;nbsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = {}
:That is, the four elements that do not match the pattern do not affect the lim&amp;nbsp;inf and lim&amp;nbsp;sup because there are only finitely many of them. In fact, these elements could be placed anywhere in the sequence (e.g., at positions 100, 150, 275, and 55000). So long as the ''tails'' of the sequence are maintained, the outer and inner limits will be unchanged. The related concepts of ''essential'' inner and outer limits, which use the [[essential supremum]] and [[essential infimum]], provide an important modification that &quot;squashes&quot; countably many (rather than just finitely many) interstitial additions.

; Using the Euclidean metric

* Consider the sequence of subsets of [[rational number]]s:
::&lt;math&gt;\{X_n\} = \{ \{0\},\{1\},\{1/2\},\{1/2\},\{2/3\},\{1/3\}, \{3/4\}, \{1/4\}, \dots \}.&lt;/math&gt;
:The &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot; elements of this sequence form two subsequences, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;0},{1/2},{2/3},{3/4},...} and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;1},{1/2},{1/3},{1/4},...}, which have limit points 1 and 0, respectively, and so the outer or superior limit is the set {0,1} of these two points. However, there are no limit points that can be taken from the {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} sequence as a whole, and so the interior or inferior limit is the empty set {}. So, as in the previous example,
:* lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = {0,1}

:In each of these four cases, the elements of the limiting sets are not elements of any of the sets from the original sequence.

* The Ω limit (i.e., [[limit set]]) of a solution to a [[dynamic system]] is the outer limit of solution trajectories of the system.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSTeel09&quot;/&gt;{{rp|50&amp;ndash;51}} Because trajectories become closer and closer to this limit set, the tails of these trajectories ''converge'' to the limit set.
:* For example, an LTI system that is the [[cascade connection]] of several [[stability theory|stable]] systems with an undamped second-order [[LTI system]] (i.e., zero [[damping ratio]]) will oscillate endlessly after being perturbed (e.g., an ideal bell after being struck). Hence, if the position and velocity of this system are plotted against each other, trajectories will approach a circle in the [[state space (controls)|state space]]. This circle, which is the &amp;Omega; limit set of the system, is the outer limit of solution trajectories of the system. The circle represents the locus of a trajectory corresponding to a pure sinusoidal tone output; that is, the system output approaches/approximates a pure tone.

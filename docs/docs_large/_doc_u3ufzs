'''Sucrose'''  is common [[sugar]]. It is a [[disaccharide]], a molecule composed of two [[monosaccharides]]: [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. Sucrose is produced naturally in plants, from which [[table sugar]] is refined. It has the [[molecular formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;.

For human consumption, sucrose is extracted and refined from either [[sugarcane]] or [[sugar beet]]. [[Sugar mill]]s &amp;ndash; typically located in [[tropics|tropical regions]] near where sugarcane is grown &amp;ndash; crush the cane and produce raw sugar which is shipped to other factories for refining into pure sucrose. Sugar beet factories are located in [[temperate climate]]s where the beet is grown, and process the beets directly into refined sugar. The sugar refining process involves washing the raw sugar crystals before dissolving them into a sugar syrup which is filtered and then passed over carbon to remove any residual colour. The sugar syrup is then concentrated by boiling under a vacuum and crystallized as the final purification process to produce crystals of pure sucrose that are clear, odorless, and sweet.

Sugar is often an added ingredient in food production and food [[recipe]]s. About 185 million [[tonne]]s of sugar were produced worldwide in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;prod2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=World 2017/18 sugar production, consumption seen at record: USDA|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sugar-usda-supplies/world-2017-18-sugar-production-consumption-seen-at-record-usda-idUSKBN1DH2LV|newspaper=Reuters|author=Marcy Nicholson|date=17 November 2017|accessdate=21 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''sucrose'' was coined in 1857, by the English chemist [[William Allen Miller|William Miller]]&lt;ref&gt;William Allen Miller, ''Elements of Chemistry:  Theoretical and Practical'', Part III. Organic Chemistry (London, England:  John W. Parker and son, 1857), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cuMHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 52 and 54] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424193600/https://books.google.com/books?id=cuMHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52 |date=2017-04-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the French ''sucre'' (&quot;sugar&quot;) and the generic chemical suffix for sugars ''[[-ose]]''. The abbreviated term ''Suc'' is often used for ''sucrose'' in scientific literature.

The name ''saccharose'' was coined in 1860 by the French chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcellin Berthelot, ''Chimie organique fondée sur la synthèse'' (Paris, France:  Mallet-Bachelier, 1860),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=7AtQYV5FlVwC&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 254–55] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627013507/http://books.google.com/books?id=7AtQYV5FlVwC&amp;pg=PA254 |date=2014-06-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Saccharose is an obsolete name for sugars in general, especially sucrose.

==Physical and chemical properties==

===Structural O-α-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-fructofuranoside===
In sucrose, the [[monomer]]s glucose and fructose are linked via an ether bond between C1 on the [[glucosyl]] subunit and C2 on the fructosyl unit. The bond is called a [[glycosidic linkage]]. Glucose exists predominantly as a mixture of α and β  &quot;pyranose&quot; isomers, but only the α form links to fructose. Fructose itself exists as a mixture of α and β &quot;furanose&quot; isomers, but only the β isomer links to glucose. Unlike most disaccharides, the glycosidic bond in sucrose is formed between the reducing ends of both glucose and fructose, and not between the reducing end of one and the non-reducing end of the other. This linkage inhibits further bonding to other saccharide units, and prevents sucrose from spontaneously reacting with cellular and circulatory macromolecules in the manner that glucose and other reducing sugars do. Since sucrose contains no anomeric hydroxyl groups, it is classified as a non-[[reducing sugar]].

Sucrose crystallizes in the [[monoclinic]] [[space group]] P2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with room-temperature lattice parameters ''a'' = 1.08631&amp;nbsp;nm, ''b'' = 0.87044&amp;nbsp;nm, ''c'' = 0.77624&amp;nbsp;nm, β = 102.938°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Acta Crystallogr|year = 1952|volume = 5|pages = 689–90|doi = 10.1107/S0365110X52001908|title = The crystal structure of sucrose|author1=Beevers, C.

The purity of sucrose is measured by [[polarimetry]], through the rotation of [[Polarization (waves)|plane-polarized light]] by a sugar solution. The [[specific rotation]] at 20&amp;nbsp;°C using yellow &quot;sodium-D&quot; light (589&amp;nbsp;nm) is +66.47°. Commercial samples of sugar are assayed using this parameter. Sucrose does not deteriorate at ambient conditions.

Sucrose does not melt at high temperatures. Instead, it decomposes at {{convert|186|°C}} to form [[caramel]]. Like other [[carbohydrate]]s, it combusts to [[carbon dioxide]] and water. Mixing sucrose with the oxidizer [[potassium nitrate]] produces the fuel known as [[rocket candy]] that is used to propel amateur rocket motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/sucrose.html |first=Richard |last=Nakka| website=Experimental Rocketry |title=Potassium Nitrate/Sucrose Propellant (KNSU) |accessdate=2015-11-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026075559/http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/sucrose.html |archivedate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 9 CO + 3 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 11 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3 K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

This reaction is somewhat simplified though. Some of the carbon does get fully oxidized to carbon dioxide, and other reactions, such as the [[water-gas shift reaction]] also take place. A more accurate theoretical equation is:

:C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + 6.288 KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3.796 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 5.205 CO + 7.794 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3.065 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3.143 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2.998 K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.274 KOH &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/succhem.html |first=Richard |last=Nakka |website=Experimental Rocketry|title=KN-Sucrose (KNSU) Propellant Chemistry and Performance Characteristics |accessdate=2014-08-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118052432/http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/succhem.html |archivedate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sucrose burns with [[chloric acid]], formed by the reaction of [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[potassium chlorate]]:

: 8 HClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; → 11 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 12 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 HCl

Sucrose can be dehydrated with [[sulfuric acid]] to form a black, [[carbon]]-rich solid, as indicated in the following idealized equation:
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(catalyst) + C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; → 12 C + 11 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Heat (and some H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a result of the heat).

The formula for sucrose's decomposition can be represented as a two-step reaction: the first simplified reaction is dehydration of sucrose to pure carbon and water, and then carbon oxidises to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from air.

:C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + heat → 12 C + 11 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:12 C + 12 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 12 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Hydrolysis===
[[Hydrolysis]] breaks the [[glycosidic bond]] converting sucrose into [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. [[Hydrolysis]] is, however, so slow that solutions of sucrose can sit for years with negligible change. If the [[enzyme]] [[sucrase]] is added, however, the reaction will proceed rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/571354/sucrase &quot;Sucrase&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425011926/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/571354/sucrase |date=2010-04-25 }}, ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrolysis can also be accelerated with acids, such as [[cream of tartar]] or lemon juice, both weak acids. Likewise, gastric acidity converts sucrose to glucose and fructose during digestion, the bond between them being an acetal bond which can be broken by an acid.

Given [[Higher heating value|(higher) heats of combustion]] of 1349.6&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol for sucrose, 673.0 for glucose, and 675.6 for fructose,&lt;ref&gt;All three from ''[[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]'', 49th edition, 1968-1969, pp. D-184-189.&lt;/ref&gt; digestion releases about 4 [[small calorie]]s per gram of each of these products.

===Synthesis and biosynthesis of sucrose===
The [[biosynthesis]] of sucrose proceeds via the precursors [[UDP-glucose]] and [[fructose 6-phosphate]], catalyzed by the enzyme [[Sucrose-phosphate synthase|sucrose-6-phosphate synthase]]. The energy for the reaction is gained by the cleavage of [[uridine diphosphate]] (UDP).
Sucrose is formed by plants, [[algae]] and cyanobacteria but not by other [[organism]]s. Sucrose is the end product of [[photosynthesis]] and is found naturally in many food plants along with the [[monosaccharide]] [[fructose]]. In many fruits, such as [[pineapple]] and [[apricot]], sucrose is the main sugar. In others, such as [[grapes]] and [[pear]]s, fructose is the main sugar.

 
====Chemical synthesis====
[[File:Sucrose.gif|thumb|Model of sucrose molecule]]
Although sucrose is almost invariably isolated from natural sources, its chemical synthesis was first achieved in 1953 by [[Raymond Lemieux]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Lemieux&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Lemieux|first1 = R. U.|authorlink1 = Raymond Lemieux|last2 = Huber|first2 = G.|title = A chemical synthesis of sucrose|journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc.|volume = 75|issue = 16|page = 4118|year = 1953|doi = 10.1021/ja01112a545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources ==
In nature, sucrose is present in many plants, and in particular their roots, fruits and [[nectar]]s, because it serves as a way to store energy, primarily from [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0021259 |title=Sucrose Metabolism |author=John E.

Seen from a human consumption perspective, [[honeybee]]s are especially important because they accumulate sucrose and produce [[honey]], an important foodstuff all over the world. The carbohydrates in honey itself primarily consist of [[fructose]] and [[glucose]] with trace amounts of sucrose only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foods and Food Production Encyclopedia |author=Douglas M. Considine |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Company Inc.|date=1982 |page=956|edition=1 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-8511-0|isbn=978-1-4684-8513-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As fruits ripen, their sucrose content usually rises sharply, but some fruits contain almost no sucrose at all. This includes grapes, cherries, blueberries, blackberries, figs, pomegranates, tomatoes, avocados, lemons and limes.

Sucrose is a naturally occurring sugar, but with the advent of [[industrialization]], it has been increasingly refined and consumed in all kinds of processed foods.

{{Main|History of sugar}}
The production of table sugar has a long history. Some scholars claim Indians discovered how to crystallize sugar during the [[Gupta dynasty]], around AD 350.&lt;ref name=Adas&gt;
Adas, Michael (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&amp;pg=PA311 ''Agricultural and Pastoral Societies in Ancient and Classical History''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614041819/http://books.google.com/books?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&amp;pg=PA311 |date=2013-06-14 }}. Temple University Press. {{ISBN|1-56639-832-0}}. p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars point to the ancient manuscripts of China, dated to the 8th century BC, where one of the earliest historical mentions of [[sugar cane]] is included along with the fact that their knowledge of sugar cane was derived from India.&lt;ref name=&quot;gr1&quot;/&gt; Further, it appears that by about 500 BC, residents of present-day India began making sugar syrup and cooling it in large flat bowls to make raw table sugar crystals that were easier to store and transport. In the local Indian language, these crystals were called ''khanda'' (खण्ड), which is the source of the word ''candy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sugarcane: Saccharum Offcinarum|publisher=USAID, Govt of United States|year=2006|page=7.1|url=http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag&amp;environ/Sugarcane.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106015828/http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag%26environ/Sugarcane.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The army of Alexander the Great was halted on the banks of river [[Indus River|Indus]] by the refusal of his troops to go further east. They saw people in the Indian subcontinent growing sugarcane and making ''granulated, salt-like sweet powder'', locally called ''sākhar'' (साखर), pronounced as ''sakcharon'' (ζακχαρον) in Greek (Modern Greek, ''zachari'' ζάχαρη). On their return journey, the Greek soldiers carried back some of the &quot;honey-bearing reeds&quot;. Sugarcane remained a limited crop for over a millennium. Sugar was a rare commodity and traders of sugar became wealthy. Venice, at the height of its financial power, was the chief sugar-distributing center of Europe.&lt;ref name=gr1&gt;{{cite book|title=Something about sugar: its history, growth, manufacture and distribution|author=Rolph, George |year=1873|url=https://archive.org/details/somethingaboutsu00rolprich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabs started producing it in [[Sicily]] and [[Spain]]. Only after the [[Crusades]] did it begin to rival honey as a sweetener in Europe. The Spanish began cultivating sugarcane in the [[West Indies]] in 1506 ([[Cuba]] in 1523). The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] first cultivated sugarcane in [[Brazil]] in 1532.

Sugar remained a luxury in much of the world until the 18th century. Only the wealthy could afford it. In the 18th century, the demand for table sugar boomed in Europe and by the 19th century it had become regarded as a human necessity.&lt;ref name=mintz/&gt; The use of sugar grew from use in tea, to [[cake]]s, [[candy|confectionery]] and [[chocolate]]s. Suppliers marketed sugar in novel forms, such as solid cones, which required consumers to use a [[sugar nips|sugar nip]], a pliers-like tool, in order to break off pieces.

The demand for cheaper table sugar drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and table sugar manufacturing could thrive. Growing sugar cane crop in hot humid climates, and producing table sugar in high temperature sugar mills was harsh, inhumane work. The demand for cheap and docile labor for this work, in part, first drove slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa), followed by indentured labor trade from South Asia (in particular India).&lt;ref name=britain1&gt;{{cite web|title=Forced Labour|year=2010|publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/india/forced.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204015712/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/india/forced.htm|archivedate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lai, Walton|title=Indentured labor, Caribbean sugar: Chinese and Indian migrants to the British West Indies, 1838–1918|year=1993|isbn=978-0-8018-7746-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vertovik, Steven|editor=Cohen, Robin|title=The Cambridge survey of world migration|year=1995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgesurveyo00robi/page/57 57–68]|isbn=978-0-521-44405-7|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgesurveyo00robi/page/57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of slaves, followed by millions of indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Islands, East Africa, Natal, north and eastern parts of South America, and southeast Asia.

Beginning in the late 18th century, the production of sugar became increasingly mechanized. The [[steam engine]] first powered a sugar mill in [[Jamaica]] in 1768, and, soon after, steam replaced direct firing as the source of process heat. During the same century, Europeans began experimenting with sugar production from other crops. [[Andreas Marggraf]] identified sucrose in [[beet root]]&lt;ref&gt;Marggraf (1747) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJQDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Experiences chimiques faites dans le dessein de tirer un veritable sucre de diverses plantes, qui croissent dans nos contrées&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624083152/https://books.google.com/books?id=lJQDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA79 |date=2016-06-24 }} [Chemical experiments made with the intention of extracting real sugar from diverse plants that grow in our lands], ''Histoire de l'académie royale des sciences et belles-lettres de Berlin'', pp. 79–90.&lt;/ref&gt; and his student [[Franz Achard]] built a sugar beet processing factory in Silesia (Prussia). The beet-sugar industry took off during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], when France and the continent were cut off from Caribbean sugar.

Table sugar (sucrose) comes from plant sources. Two important sugar crops predominate: [[sugarcane]] (''Saccharum spp.'') and [[sugar beet]]s (''Beta vulgaris''), in which sugar can account for 12% to 20% of the plant's dry weight. Minor commercial sugar crops include the [[date palm]] (''Phoenix dactylifera''), [[sorghum]] (''Sorghum vulgare''), and the [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum''). Sucrose is obtained by extraction of these crops with hot water; concentration of the extract gives syrups, from which solid sucrose can be crystallized. In 2017, worldwide production of table sugar amounted to 185 million tonnes.&lt;ref name=prod2017/&gt;

Most cane sugar comes from countries with warm climates, because sugarcane does not tolerate frost. Sugar beets, on the other hand, grow only in cooler temperate regions and do not tolerate extreme heat. About 80 percent of sucrose is derived from sugarcane, the rest almost all from sugar beets.

In mid-2018, India and Brazil had about the same production of sugar &amp;ndash; 34 million tonnes &amp;ndash; followed by the [[European Union]], [[Thailand]], and China as the major producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;usda2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Sugar: World Markets and Trade |url=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/sugar.pdf |publisher=Office of Global Analysis, Foreign Agricultural Service, US Department of Agriculture |accessdate=21 December 2018 |date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; India, the European Union, and China were the leading domestic consumers of sugar in 2018.&lt;ref name=usda2018/&gt;

Beet sugar comes from regions with cooler climates: northwest and eastern Europe, northern Japan, plus some areas in the United States (including California). In the northern hemisphere, the beet-growing season ends with the start of harvesting around September. Harvesting and processing continues until March in some cases. The availability of processing plant capacity and the weather both influence the duration of harvesting and processing&amp;nbsp;– the industry can store harvested beets until processed, but a frost-damaged beet becomes effectively unprocessable.

The United States sets high sugar prices to support its producers, with the effect that many former purchasers of sugar have switched to [[corn syrup]] (beverage manufacturers) or moved out of the country (candy manufacturers).

The low prices of [[glucose syrup]]s produced from [[wheat]] and corn ([[maize]]) threaten the traditional sugar market. Used in combination with [[artificial sweetener]]s, they can allow drink manufacturers to produce very low-cost goods.

High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is significantly cheaper as a sweetener for food and beverage manufacturing than refined sucrose.&lt;ref name=&quot;berk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=Densie Webb |title=Is High-Fructose Corn Syrup Worse Than Regular Sugar? |url=https://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/nutrition/article/high-fructose-corn-syrup-worse-regular-sugar |publisher=Berkeley Wellness, University of California - Berkeley |accessdate=19 September 2019 |date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to sucrose being partially displaced in U.S. industrial food production by HFCS and other non-sucrose natural sweeteners.&lt;ref name=berk/&gt;&lt;ref name=tara/&gt;

===Types===

====Cane====

Since the 6th century BC, cane sugar producers have crushed the harvested vegetable material from sugarcane in order to collect and filter the juice. They then treat the liquid (often with [[calcium oxide|lime (calcium oxide)]]) to remove impurities and then neutralize it. Boiling the juice then allows the sediment to settle to the bottom for dredging out, while the scum rises to the surface for skimming off. In cooling, the liquid crystallizes, usually in the process of stirring, to produce sugar crystals. [[Centrifuge]]s usually remove the uncrystallized syrup. The producers can then either sell the sugar product for use as is, or process it further to produce lighter grades. The later processing may take place in another factory in another country.

Sugarcane is a major component of Brazilian agriculture; the country is the world's largest producer of sugarcane and its derivative products, such as crystallized sugar and [[ethanol]] ([[ethanol fuel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Sugarcane Producing Countries: Brazil outperforms its next 6 closest competitors combined|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-sugarcane-producing-countries.html|publisher=World Atlas|accessdate=2 January 2018|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beet====

{{Main|Sugar beet}}
Beet sugar producers slice the washed beets, then extract the sugar with hot water in a &quot;[[Diffuser (heat)|diffuser]]&quot;. An alkaline solution (&quot;[[Lime water|milk of lime]]&quot; and [[carbon dioxide]] from the lime kiln) then serves to [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] impurities (see [[carbonatation]]). After filtration,{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} evaporation concentrates the juice to a content of about 70% solids, and controlled crystallisation extracts the sugar. A centrifuge removes the sugar crystals from the liquid, which gets recycled in the crystalliser stages. When economic constraints prevent the removal of more sugar, the manufacturer discards the remaining liquid, now known as [[molasses]], or sells it on to producers of animal feed.

Sieving the resultant white sugar produces different grades for selling.

=====Cane versus beet=====
It is difficult to distinguish between fully refined sugar produced from beet and cane. One way is by [[isotope analysis]] of carbon. Cane uses [[C4 carbon fixation]], and beet uses [[C3 carbon fixation]], resulting in a different ratio of [[carbon 13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[carbon 12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C]] isotopes in the sucrose. Tests are used to detect fraudulent abuse of [[European Union]] subsidies or to aid in the detection of adulterated [[fruit juice]].

Sugar cane tolerates hot climates better, but the production of sugar cane needs approximately four times as much water as the production of sugar beet. As a result, some countries that traditionally produced cane sugar (such as [[Egypt]]) have built new beet sugar factories since about 2008. Some sugar factories process both sugar cane and sugar beets and extend their processing period in that way.

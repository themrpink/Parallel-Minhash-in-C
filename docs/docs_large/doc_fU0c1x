The ''Picea/Abies'' forests of the Alberta foothills are often characterized by deep accumulations of organic matter on the soil surface and cold soil temperatures, both of which make reforestation difficult and result in a general deterioration in site productivity; Endean and Johnstone (1974)&lt;ref name=&quot;end&quot;&gt;Endean, F.; Johnstone, W.D. 1974. Prescribed fire and regeneration on clearcut spruce–fir sites in the foothills of Alberta. Environ. Can., Can. For. Serv., Northern For. Res. Centre, Edmonton AB, Inf. Rep. NOR-X-126. 33 p.&lt;/ref&gt; describe experiments to test prescribed burning as a means of seedbed preparation and site amelioration on representative clear-felled ''Picea/Abies'' areas. Results showed that, in general, prescribed burning did not reduce organic layers satisfactorily, nor did it increase soil temperature, on the sites tested. Increases in seedling establishment, survival, and growth on the burned sites were probably the result of slight reductions in the depth of the organic layer, minor increases in soil temperature, and marked improvements in the efficiency of the planting crews. Results also suggested that the process of site deterioration has not been reversed by the burning treatments applied.

===Ameliorative intervention===
Slash weight (the oven-dry weight of the entire crown and that portion of the stem less than four inches in diameter) and size distribution are major factors influencing the [[Wildfire|forest fire]] hazard on harvested sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;kii1&quot;&gt;Kiil, A.D. 1965. Weight and size distribution of slash of white spruce and lodgepole pine. For. Chron. 41:432–437.&lt;/ref&gt; Forest managers interested in the application of prescribed burning for hazard reduction and silviculture, were shown a method for quantifying the slash load by Kiil (1968).&lt;ref name=&quot;kii2&quot;&gt;Kiil, A.D. 1968. Weight of the fuel complex in 70-year-old lodgepole pine stands of different densities. Department of Forestry and Rural Development, Forest Research Laboratory, Calgary, Alberta. Departmental Publication 1228. 13 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In west-central Alberta, he felled, measured, and weighed 60 white spruce, graphed (a) slash weight per merchantable unit volume against diameter at breast height (dbh), and (b) weight of fine slash (&lt;1.27&amp;nbsp;cm) also against dbh, and produced a table of slash weight and size distribution on one acre of a hypothetical stand of white spruce. When the diameter distribution of a stand is unknown, an estimate of slash weight and size distribution can be obtained from average stand diameter, number of trees per unit area, and merchantable cubic foot volume. The sample trees in Kiil's study had full symmetrical crowns. Densely growing trees with short and often irregular crowns would probably be overestimated; open-grown trees with long crowns would probably be underestimated.

The need to provide shade for young outplants of [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]] in the high [[Rocky Mountains]] is emphasized by the U.S. Forest Service. Acceptable planting spots are defined as microsites on the north and east sides of down logs, stumps, or slash, and lying in the shadow cast by such material.&lt;ref name=&quot;ronco&quot;&gt;Ronco, F. 1975. Diagnosis: sunburned trees. J. For. 73(1):31–35. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Where the objectives of management specify more uniform spacing, or higher densities, than obtainable from an existing distribution of shade-providing material, redistribution or importing of such material has been undertaken.

===Access===
Site preparation on some sites might be done simply to facilitate access by planters, or to improve access and increase the number or distribution of microsites suitable for planting or seeding.

Wang et al. (2000)&lt;ref name=&quot;wang&quot;&gt;Wang, G.G.; Siemens, A.; Keenan, V.; Philippot, D. 2000. Survival and growth of black and white spruce seedlings in relation to stock type, site preparation and plantation type in southeastern Manitoba. For. Chron. 76(5):775–782.&lt;/ref&gt; determined field performance of white and black spruces 8 and 9 years after outplanting on boreal mixedwood sites following site preparation (Donaren disc trenching versus no trenching) in 2 plantation types (open versus sheltered) in southeastern Manitoba. Donaren trenching slightly reduced the mortality of black spruce but significantly increased the mortality of white spruce. Significant difference in height was found between open and sheltered plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce, and root collar diameter in sheltered plantations was significantly larger than in open plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce. Black spruce open plantation had significantly smaller volume (97&amp;nbsp;cm³) compared with black spruce sheltered (210&amp;nbsp;cm³), as well as white spruce open (175&amp;nbsp;cm³) and sheltered (229&amp;nbsp;cm³) plantations. White spruce open plantations also had smaller volume than white spruce sheltered plantations. For transplant stock, strip plantations had a significantly higher volume (329&amp;nbsp;cm³) than open plantations (204&amp;nbsp;cm³). Wang et al. (2000)&lt;ref name=&quot;wang&quot; /&gt; recommended that sheltered plantation site preparation should be used.

===Mechanical===
Up to 1970, no &quot;sophisticated&quot; site preparation equipment had become operational in Ontario,&lt;ref name=&quot;hall&quot;&gt;Hall, J. 1970. Site preparation in Ontario. For. Chron. 46:445–447.&lt;/ref&gt; but the need for more efficacious and versatile equipment was increasingly recognized. By this time, improvements were being made to equipment originally developed by field staff, and field testing of equipment from other sources was increasing.

According to J. Hall (1970),&lt;ref name=&quot;hall&quot; /&gt; in Ontario at least, the most widely used site preparation technique was post-harvest mechanical scarification by equipment front-mounted on a bulldozer (blade, rake, V-plow, or teeth), or dragged behind a tractor (Imsett or S.F.I. scarifier, or rolling chopper). Drag type units designed and constructed by Ontario's Department of Lands and Forests used anchor chain or tractor pads separately or in combination, or were finned steel drums or barrels of various sizes and used in sets alone or combined with tractor pad or anchor chain units.

J. Hall's (1970)&lt;ref name=&quot;hall&quot; /&gt; report on the state of site preparation in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant [[hardwood]] stands for natural regeneration of [[Betula alleghaniensis|yellow birch]]. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine–spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been &quot;quite successful&quot; for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.

===Mounding===
Site preparation treatments that create raised planting spots have commonly improved outplant performance on sites subject to low soil temperature and excess soil moisture. Mounding can certainly have a big influence on soil temperature. Draper et al. (1985),&lt;ref name=&quot;drap&quot;&gt;Draper, D.; Binder, W.; Fahlman, R.; Spittlehouse, D. 1985. Post-planting ecophysiology of Interior spruce. Interior Spruce Seedling Performance: State of the Art. Northern Silvic. Committee, Prince George BC. 18 p. (mimeo).&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, documented this as well as the effect it had on root growth of outplants (Table 30).

The mounds warmed up quickest, and at soil depths of 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm and 10&amp;nbsp;cm averaged 10 and 7&amp;nbsp;°C higher, respectively, than in the control. On sunny days, daytime surface temperature maxima on the mound and organic mat reached 25&amp;nbsp;°C to 60&amp;nbsp;°C, depending on soil wetness and shading. Mounds reached mean soil temperatures of 10&amp;nbsp;°C at 10&amp;nbsp;cm depth 5 days after planting, but the control did not reach that temperature until 58 days after planting. During the first growing season, mounds had 3 times as many days with a mean soil temperature greater than 10&amp;nbsp;°C than did the control microsites.

Draper et al.'s (1985)&lt;ref name=&quot;drap&quot; /&gt; mounds received 5 times the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) summed over all sampled microsites throughout the first growing season; the control treatment consistently received about 14% of daily background PAR, while mounds received over 70%. By November, fall frosts had reduced shading, eliminating the differential. Quite apart from its effect on temperature, incident radiation is also important photosynthetically. The average control microsite was exposed to levels of light above the compensation point for only 3 hours, i.e., one-quarter of the daily light period, whereas mounds received light above the compensation point for 11 hours, i.e., 86% of the same daily period. Assuming that incident light in the 100–600 µEm‾²s‾1 intensity range is the most important for [[photosynthesis]], the mounds received over 4 times the total daily light energy that reached the control microsites.

===Orientation of linear site preparation===
With linear site preparation, orientation is sometimes dictated by [[topography]] or other considerations, but the orientation can often be chosen. It can make a difference. A disk-trenching experiment in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone in interior British Columbia investigated the effect on growth of young outplants ([[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]]) in 13 microsite planting positions: berm, hinge, and trench in each of north, south, east, and west aspects, as well as in untreated locations between the furrows.&lt;ref name=&quot;burt&quot;&gt;Burton, P.; Bedford L.; Goldstein, M.; Osberg, M. 2000. Effect of disk trench orientation and planting spot position on the ten-year performance of lodgepole pine. New For. 20:23–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Tenth-year stem volumes of trees on south-, east-, and west-facing microsites were significantly greater than those of trees on north-facing and untreated microsites. However, planting spot selection was seen to be more important overall than trench orientation.

In a Minnesota study, the N–S strips accumulated more snow but snow melted faster than on E–W strips in the first year after felling.&lt;ref name=&quot;clau&quot;&gt;Clausen, J.C.; Mace, A.C., Jr. 1972. Accumulation and snowmelt on north–south versus east–west oriented clearcut strips. Univ. Minnesota, Coll. For., St. Paul MN, Minn. For. Res. Notes No. 34. 4 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Snow-melt was faster on strips near the centre of the strip-felled area than on border strips adjoining the intact stand. The strips, 50 feet (15.24 m) wide, alternating with uncut strips 16 feet (4.88 m) wide, were felled in a ''Pinus resinosa'' stand, aged 90 to 100 years.

A '''threshing machine''' or a '''thresher''' is a piece of [[agricultural machinery|farm equipment]] that threshes [[grain]], that is, it removes the [[seed]]s from the [[plant stem|stalks]] and [[husk]]s. It does so by beating the plant to make the seeds fall out.

Before such machines were developed, [[threshing]] was done by hand with [[flail]]s: such hand threshing was very laborious and time-consuming, taking about one-quarter of agricultural labour by the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mechanization]] of this process removed a substantial amount of drudgery from farm labour. The first threshing machine was invented circa 1786 by the Scottish engineer [[Andrew Meikle]], and the subsequent adoption of such machines was one of the earlier examples of the [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization of agriculture]]. During the 19th century, threshers and mechanical [[reaper]]s and [[reaper-binder]]s gradually became widespread and made grain production much less laborious.

Michael Stirling is said to have invented a rotary threshing machine in 1758 which for forty years was used to process all the corn on his farm at Gateside. No published works have yet been found but his son William made a sworn statement to his minister to this fact. He also gave him the details of his father's death in 1796.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Separate reaper-binders and threshers have largely been replaced by machines that combine all of their functions, that is [[combine harvester]]s or combines. However, the simpler machines remain important as [[appropriate technology]] in low-[[financial capital|capital]] farming contexts, both in [[developing country|developing countries]] and in developed countries on small farms that strive for especially high levels of [[self-sufficiency]]. For example, [[threshers, pedal powered|pedal-powered threshers]] are a low-cost option, and some [[Amish]] sects use horse-drawn binders and old-style threshers.

As the verb ''[[wikt:thresh#Verb|thresh]]'' is [[cognate]] with the verb ''[[wikt:thrash#Verb|thrash]]'' (and [[synonym]]ous in the grain-beating [[word sense|sense]]), the names '''thrashing machine''' and '''thrasher''' are (less common) [[free variation|alternate forms]].

== Early social impacts ==
[[Image:Batteuse 1881.jpg|2|thumb|Threshing machine from 1881]]
The [[Swing Riots]] in the UK were partly a result of the threshing machine. Following years of war, high taxes and low wages, farm labourers finally [[revolt]]ed in 1830. These farm labourers had faced unemployment for a number of years due to the widespread introduction of the threshing machine and the policy of [[enclosure|enclosing]] fields. No longer were thousands of men needed to tend the crops, a few would suffice. With fewer jobs, lower wages and no prospects of things improving for these workers the threshing machine was the final straw, the machine was to place them on the brink of starvation. The Swing Rioters smashed threshing machines and threatened farmers who had them.

The riots were dealt with very harshly. Nine of the rioters were hanged and a further 450 were [[Penal transportation|transported]] to [[Australia]].

== Later adoption ==

[[Image:Rhof-windfege.ogg|200px|thumb|Irreler Bauerntradition shows a [[winnowing machine]] at the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]]]]
Early threshing machines were hand-fed and horse-powered. They were small by today's standards and were about the size of an upright [[piano]].  Later machines were [[steam engine|steam-powered]], driven by a [[portable engine]] or [[traction engine]]. Isaiah Jennings, a skilled inventor, created a small thresher that doesn't harm the straw in the process. In 1834, John Avery and Hiram Abial Pitts devised significant improvements to a machine that automatically threshes and separates grain from chaff, freeing farmers from a slow and laborious process. Avery and Pitts were granted United States patent #542 on December 29, 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=0000542.PN.&amp;OS=PN/0000542&amp;RS=PN/0000542 |title=United States Patent: 0000542 |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When threshing machines were harvest kings|publisher=Small Business Advances|url=http://www.ledgersentinel.com/article.asp?a=6393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Ridley (inventor)|John Ridley]], an Australian inventor, also developed a threshing machine in [[South Australia]] in 1843.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020334b.htm |title=Ridley, John (1806 - 1887) |accessdate=2007-08-19 |author=H.

The [[Household Cyclopedia|1881 ''Household Cyclopedia'']] said of Meikle's machine:

:&quot;Since the invention of this machine, Mr. Meikle and others have progressively introduced a variety of improvements, all tending to simplify the labour, and to augment the quantity of the work performed. When first erected, though the grain was equally well separated from the straw, yet as the whole of the straw, chaff, and grain, was indiscriminately thrown into a confused heap, the work could only with propriety be considered as half executed. By the addition of rakes, or shakers, and two pairs of fanners, all driven by the same machinery, the different processes of thrashing, shaking, and [[winnowing]] are now all at once performed, and the grain immediately prepared for the public market. When it is added, that the quantity of grain gained from the superior powers of the machine is fully equal to a twentieth part of the crop, and that, in some cases, the expense of thrashing and cleaning the grain is considerably less than what was formerly paid for cleaning it alone, the immense saving arising from the invention will at once be seen.

:&quot;The expense of horse labour, from the increased value of the animal and the charge of his keeping, being an object of great importance, it is recommended that, upon all sizable farms, that is to say, where two hundred acres [800,000 m²], or upwards, of grain are sown, the machine should be worked by wind, unless where local circumstances afford the conveniency of water.  Where coals are plenty and cheap, steam may be advantageously used for working the machine.&quot;

Steam-powered machines used belts connected to a [[traction engine]]; often both engine and thresher belonged to a contractor who toured the farms of a district. Steam remained a viable commercial option until the early post-WWII years.

[[File:Batteuse - St-Michel 1.JPG|thumb|right|Open-air museum in [[Saint-Hubert, Belgium]].]]

==Farming process==

Threshing is just one step of the process in getting cereals to the grinding mill and customer.
The wheat needs to be grown, cut, [[stook]]ed (shocked, bundled), hauled, threshed, [[winnowing|de-chaffed]], [[straw bale]]d, and then the grain hauled to a [[grain elevator]]. For many years each of these steps was an individual process, requiring teams of workers and many machines. In the steep hill wheat country of [[Palouse]] in the Northwest of the United States, steep ground meant moving machinery around was problematic and prone to rolling. To reduce the amount of work on the sidehills, the idea arose of combining the wheat binder and thresher into one machine, known as a [[combine harvester]].  About 1910, horse pulled combines appeared and became a success.  Later, gas and diesel engines appeared with other refinements and specifications.

== Modern developments ==

===In Europe and Americas===
[[File:Agriculture of Bangladesh 10.jpg|thumb|Threshing of paddy by machine, Bangladesh.]]
Modern day combine harvesters (or simply [[combine harvester|combines]]) operate on the same principles and use the same components as the original threshing machines built in the 19th century.  Combines also perform the reaping operation at the same time.  The name ''combine'' is derived from the fact that the two steps are combined in a single machine.  Also, most modern combines are self-powered (usually by a diesel engine) and self-propelled, although tractor powered, pull type combines models were offered by John Deere and Case International into the 1990s.

Today, as in the 19th century, the threshing begins with a cylinder and concave.  The cylinder has sharp serrated bars, and rotates at high speed (about 500 RPM), so that the bars beat against the entire plant as it is mechanically fed from the reaping equipment at the front of the combine to the gap between the concave and the rotating beater/cylinder.  The concave is curved to match the curve of the cylinder, and the grain, now separated from the plant stalks falls immediately through grated openings in the concave as it is beaten.  The motion of the rotating cylinder thrusts the remaining straw and chaff toward the rear of the machine.

Whilst the majority of the grain falls through the concave, the straw is carried by a set of &quot;walkers&quot; to the rear of the machine, allowing any grain and chaff still in the straw to fall below.  Below the straw walkers, a fan blows a stream of air across the grain, removing dust and small bits of crushed plant material out of the back of the combine. The residues fall to the ground and occasional are collected for other purposes, such as fodder.

The grain, either coming through the concave or the walkers, meets a set of sieves mounted on an assembly called a shoe, which is shaken mechanically.  The top sieve has larger openings, and serves to remove large pieces of chaff from the grain.  The lower sieve separates clean grain, which falls through, from incompletely threshed pieces.  The incompletely threshed grain is returned to the cylinder by means of a system of conveyors, where the process repeats.

Some threshing machines were equipped with a bagger, which invariably held two bags, one being filled, and the other being replaced with an empty.  A worker called a ''sewer'' removed and replaced the bags, and sewed full bags shut with a needle and thread.  Other threshing machines would discharge grain from a conveyor, for bagging by hand.  Combines are equipped with a grain tank, which accumulates grain for deposit in a truck or wagon.

A large amount of chaff and straw would accumulate around a threshing machine, and several innovations, such as the air chaffer, were developed to deal with this.  Combines generally chop and disperse straw as they move through the field, though the chopping is disabled when the straw is to be baled, and chaff collectors are sometimes used to prevent the dispersal of weed seed throughout a field.

The [[corn sheller]] was almost identical in design, with slight modifications to deal with the larger kernel size and presence of cobs.  Modern-day combines can be adjusted to work with any grain crop, and many unusual seed crops.

Both the older and modern machines require a good deal of effort to operate. The concave clearance, cylinder speed, fan velocity, sieve sizes, and feeding rate must be adjusted for crop conditions.

===Another development in Asia===
[[File:Petrol powered threshing machine in Hainan - 01.ogv|thumbnail|Video of a petrol-powered machine threshing rice in [[Hainan]], China]]
From the early 20th century, petrol or diesel-powered threshing machines, designed especially to thresh [[rice]], the most important crop in Asia, have been developed along different lines to the modern combine.

Even after the combine was invented and became popular, a new compact-size thresher called a ''harvester'', with wheels, still remains in use and at present it is available from a Japanese agricultural manufacturer. The compact-size machine is very convenient to handle in small terrace fields in mountain areas where a large machine, such as combine, is not usable.

People there use this harvester with a modern compact [[Reaper-binder|binder]].

==Preservation==
A number of older threshing machines have survived into preservation. They are often to be seen in operation at [[live steam]] festivals and [[traction engine]] rallies such as the [[Great Dorset Steam Fair]] in England, and the [[WMSTR|Western Minnesota Steam Threshers Reunion]] in northwest [[Minnesota]].

===Musical references===
Irish songwriter John Duggan&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bardis.ie/composers.htm#duggan&lt;/ref&gt; immortalised the threshing machine in the song &quot;The Old Thrashing Mill&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyrics.ms/lyrics/foster-allen/the-old-threshing-mill/157788.htm Song lyrics: ''The Old Threshing Mill'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The song has been recorded by [[Foster and Allen]] and [[Brendan Shine]].

On the [[Alan Lomax]] collection ''Songs of Seduction'' (Rounder Select, 2000), there is a bawdy Irish folk song called &quot;The Thrashing Machine&quot; sung by tinker Annie O'Neil, as recorded in the early 20th century.

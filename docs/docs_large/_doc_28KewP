[[Tactical urbanism|Tactical Urbanism]] (also known as DIY Urbanism, Planning-by-Doing, Urban Acupuncture, or Urban Prototyping) is a city, organizational, or citizen-led approach to neighborhood-building that uses short-term, low-cost, and scalable interventions and policies to catalyze long term change. 

Top-up Urbanism is the theory and implementation of two techniques in urban design: top-down and bottom-up. Top-down urbanism is when the design is implemented from the top of the hierarchy - normally the government or planning department. Bottom-up or grassroots urbanism begins with the people or the bottom of the hierarchy. Top-up means that both methods are used together to make a more participatory design, so it is sure to be comprehensive and well regarded in order to be as successful as possible.

Infrastructural Urbanism is the study of how the major investments that go into making infrastructural systems can be leveraged to be more sustainable for communities. Instead of the systems being solely about efficiency in both cost and production, infrastructural urbanism strives to utilize these investments to be more equitable for social and environmental issues as well. Linda Samuels is a designer investigating how to accomplish this change in infrastructure in what she calls &quot;next-generation infrastructure&quot; which is “multifunctional; public; visible; socially productive; locally specific, flexible, and adaptable; sensitive to the eco-economy; composed of design prototypes or demonstration projects; symbiotic; technologically smart; and developed collaboratively across disciplines and agencies.”

[[Sustainable urbanism|Sustainable Urbanism]] is the study from the 1990s of how a community can be beneficial for the ecosystem, the people, and the economy for which it is associated. It is based on Scott Campbell’s planner’s triangle which tries to find the balance between economy, equity and the environment. Its main concept is to try and make cities as self-sufficient as possible while not damaging the ecosystem around it, today with a increased focus on climate stability. A key designer working with sustainable urbanism is Douglas Farr.

[[Feminist urbanism|Feminist Urbanism]] is the study and critique of how the built environment effects genders differently because of patriarchal social and political structures in society. Typically, the people at the table making design decisions are men, so their conception about public space and the built environment relate to their life perspectives and experiences, which do not reflect the same experiences of women or children. [[Dolores Hayden]] is a scholar who has researched this topic from 1980 to present day. Hayden’s writing says, “when women, men and children of all classes and races can identify the public domain as the place where they feel most comfortable as citizens, Americans will finally have homelike urban space.”

Educational Urbanism is an emerging discipline, at the crossroads of urban planning, educational planning and pedagogy. An approach that tackles the notion that economic activities, the need of new skills at workplace, and the spatial configuration of the workplace rely on the spatial reorientation in the design of educational spaces and the urban dimension of educational planning.

Black Urbanism is an approach in which black communities are active creators, innovators, and authors of the process of designing and creating the neighborhoods and spaces of the metropolitan areas they have done so much to help revive over the past half century. The goal is not to build black cities for black people but to explore and develop the creative energy that exists in so-called black areas: that has the potential to contribute to the sustainable development of the whole city.

=== Debates in Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Michigan Debates on Urbanism|last=Fishman|first=Robert|publisher=The University of Michigan|year=2005|isbn=1-891197-35-5|location=Ann Arbor, MI|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Underlying the practice of urban design are the many theories about how to best design the city. Each theory makes a unique claim about how to effectively design thriving, sustainable urban environments. Debate over the efficacy of these approaches fills the urban design discourse. Landscape Urbanism and New Urbanism are commonly debated as distinct approaches to addressing suburban sprawl. While Landscape Urbanism proposes landscape as the basic building block of the city and embraces horizontality, flexibility, and adaptability, New Urbanism offers the neighborhood as the basic building block of the city and argues for increased density, mixed uses, and walkability. Opponents of Landscape Urbanism point out that most of its projects are urban parks, and as such, its application is limited. Opponents of New Urbanism claim that its preoccupation with traditional neighborhood structures is nostalgic, unimaginative, and culturally problematic. Everyday Urbanism argues for grassroots neighborhood improvements rather than master-planned, top-down interventions. Each theory elevates the roles of certain professions in the urban design process, further fueling the debate. In practice, urban designers often apply principles from many urban design theories. Emerging from the conversation is a universal acknowledgement of the importance of increased interdisciplinary collaboration in designing the modern city. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelbaugh|first=Douglas|date=2015|title=The Environmental Paradox of the City, Landscape Urbanism, and New Urbanism|journal=Consilience|issue=13|pages=1–15|issn=1948-3074|jstor=26427272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban Design as an Integrative Profession==
[[File:L'Enfant plan.jpg|thumb|L'Enfant's plan for Washington DC]]
[[File:New Road, Brighton - shared space.jpg|thumb|Gehl Architects' project for Brighton New Road employing shared space]]

Urban designers work with [[architects]], [[landscape architects]], [[transportation engineers]], urban planners, and [[industrial designers]] to reshape the city. Cooperation with public agencies, authorities, and the interests of nearby property owners is necessary to manage public spaces. Users often compete over the spaces and negotiate across a variety of spheres. Input is frequently needed from a wide range of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. This can lead to different levels of participation as defined in Arnstein's Ladder of Citizen Participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnstein|first=Sherry|date=1969|title=A Ladder of Citizen Participation|url=https://www.participatorymethods.org/sites/participatorymethods.org/files/Arnstein%20ladder%201969.pdf|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=35|pages=216–224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While there are some professionals who identify themselves specifically as urban designers, a majority have backgrounds in [[urban planning]], [[architecture]], or [[landscape architecture]]. Many collegiate programs incorporate urban design theory and design subjects into their curricula. There are an increasing number of university programs offering degrees in urban design at the post-graduate level.

Urban design considers:

*[[Pedestrian zones]]
*[[Incorporation of nature within a city]]
*[[Aesthetics]]
*''[[Urban structure]]'' – arrangement and relation of business and people
*''[[Typology (urban planning and architecture)|Urban typology]], [[Urban density|density]]'' and sustainability - spatial types and morphologies related to intensity of use, consumption of resources and production and maintenance of viable communities
*''[[Accessibility]]'' – safe and easy transportation
*''Legibility and [[wayfinding]]'' – accessible information about travel and destinations
*''Animation'' – Designing places to stimulate public activity
*''Function and fit'' – places support their varied intended uses
*''Complementary [[Mixed-use|mixed uses]]'' – Locating activities to allow constructive interaction between them
*''[[Neighbourhood character|Character]] and meaning'' – Recognizing differences between places
*''Order and incident'' – Balancing consistency and variety in the urban environment
*''Continuity and change'' – Locating people in time and place, respecting [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and contemporary culture
*''[[Civil society]]'' – people are free to interact as civic equals, important for building [[social capital]]
*Participation / engagement – including people in the decision-making process can be done at many different scales.

=== Relationships With Other Related Disciplines ===
The original urban design was thought to be separated from [[architecture]] and [[urban planning]]. Urban design has developed to a certain extent, but it still comes from the foundation of architecture. Most urban designers are primarily trained in architecture. It is often considered as a branch under the architecture, urban planning and [[landscape architecture]] and essentially the construction of the urban physical environment. Now urban design is more integrated into the social science-based, cultural, economic, political and other aspects. Not only focus on space and architectural groups, but also look at the whole city from a broader and more holistic perspective to shape a better living environment. Compared to architecture, the spatial and temporal scale of urban design processing is much larger. It deals with neighborhoods, communities, and even the entire city.

== The Urban Design Education ==
Following the 1956 Urban Design conference, Harvard University established the first graduate program with urban design in its title, The Master of Architecture in Urban Design, although as a subject taught in universities its history in Europe is far older. Urban design programs explore the built environment from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and points of view. The pedagogically innovative combination of interdisciplinary studios, lecture courses, seminars, and independent study creates an intimate and engaged educational atmosphere in which students thrive and learn. Soon after in 1961, Washington University in St. Louis founded their Master of Urban Design program. Today, eighteen urban design programs exist in the United States:

* Andrews University, Berrien Springs, MI
* Ball State University - Indianapolis, IN
* Columbia University - New York, NY
* City College of New York - New York, NY
* Georgia Tech - Atlanta, GA
* Harvard University - Cambridge, MA
* Iowa State University - Ames, IA
* New York Institute of Technology - New York, NY
* Pratt - Brooklyn, NY
* Savannah College of Art and Design - Savannah, GA
* University of California - Berkeley, CA
* University of Maryland - College Park, MD
* University of Miami - Miami, FL
* University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, MI
* University of Notre Dame - Notre Dame, IN
* University of Pennsylvania - Philadelphia, PA
* University of Texas - Austin, TX
* Washington University in St. Louis - St. Louis, MO

== Issues ==

The field of urban design holds enormous potential for helping us address today’s biggest challenges: an expanding population, mass urbanization, rising inequality, and climate change. In its practice as well as its theories, urban design attempts to tackle these pressing issues. As climate change progresses, urban design can mitigate the results of flooding, temperature changes, and increasingly detrimental storm impacts through a mindset of sustainability and resilience. In doing so, the urban design discipline attempts to create environments that are constructed with longevity in mind. Cities today must be designed to minimize resource consumption, waste generation, and pollution while also withstanding the unknown impacts of climate change. In order to be truly resilient, our cities need to be able to not just bounce back from a catastrophic climate event, but to bounce forward to an improved state.

Justice is and will always be a key issue in urban design. As previously mentioned, past urban strategies have caused injustices within communities in capable of being remedied via simple means. As urban designers tackle the issue of justice, they often are required to look at the injustices of the past and must be careful not to overlook the nuances of race, place, and socioeconomic status in their design efforts. This includes ensuring reasonable access to basic services, transportation, and fighting against gentrification and the commodification of space for economic gain. Organizations such as the Divided Cities Initiatives at Washington University in St. Louis and the Just City Lab at Harvard work on promoting justice in urban design.

Until the 1970s, the design of towns and cities took little account of the needs of [[Disability|people with disabilities]]. At that time, disabled people began to form movements demanding recognition of their potential contribution if social obstacles were removed. Disabled people challenged the 'medical model' of disability which saw physical and mental problems as an individual 'tragedy' and people with disabilities as 'brave' for enduring them. They proposed instead a 'social model' which said that barriers to disabled people result from the design of the [[built environment]] and attitudes of able-bodied people. 'Access Groups' were established composed of people with disabilities who audited their local areas, checked planning applications and made representations for improvements. The new profession of 'access officer' was established around that time to produce guidelines based on the recommendations of access groups and to oversee adaptations to existing buildings as well as to check on the accessibility of new proposals. Many [[Local government|local authorities]] now employ access officers who are regulated by the Access Association. A new chapter of the Building Regulations (Part M) was introduced in 1992. Although it was beneficial to have legislation on this issue the requirements were fairly minimal but continue to be improved with ongoing amendments. The [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] continues to raise awareness and enforce action on disability issues in the urban environment.

The '''Museum of Science and Industry''' ('''MSI''') is a [[science museum]] located in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]], in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood between [[Lake Michigan]] and [[The University of Chicago]]. It is housed in the former Palace of Fine Arts from the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. Initially endowed by [[Julius Rosenwald]], the [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]] president and philanthropist, it was supported by the [[Commercial Club of Chicago]] and opened in 1933 during the [[Century of Progress|Century of Progress Exposition]].

Among the museum's exhibits are a full-size replica [[coal|coal mine]], {{GS|U-505}} captured during [[World War II]], a {{convert|3500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} model railroad, the command module of [[Apollo 8]], and the first diesel-powered streamlined stainless-steel passenger train (''[[Pioneer Zephyr]]'').

David R. Mosena has been president and CEO of the private, non-profit&lt;ref&gt;https://www.msichicago.org/press/media-requests/media-faqs/#faqs__panel-6&lt;/ref&gt; museum since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msichicago.org/fileadmin/pdf/museum_governance/MSI_Officers_and_Directors.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612235815/http://msichicago.org/fileadmin/pdf/museum_governance/MSI_Officers_and_Directors.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 12, 2010 |title=Officers and Directors 2011 |access-date=December 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Palace of fine arts floor plan.jpg|thumb|Palace of Fine Arts floor plan]]
The '''Palace of Fine Arts''' (also known as the Fine Arts Building) at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] was designed by [[Charles B. Atwood]] for [[D. H. Burnham &amp; Co.]] The Palace of Fine Arts displayed paintings, prints, drawing, sculpture, and metal work from around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;fa&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Department of Publicity and Promotion |title=World's Columbian Exposition, 1893: official catalogue. Part X. Department K. Fine arts |date=1893 |publisher=W.B. Conkey |location=Chicago |url=https://archive.org/stream/worldscolumbian00worlb/worldscolumbian00worlb_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other &quot;White City&quot; buildings, it was constructed with a brick substructure under its plaster facade.

After the World's Fair, it initially housed the Columbian Museum, which evolved into the [[Field Museum of Natural History]]. When the Field Museum moved to a new building near downtown Chicago in 1920, the former site was left vacant.

[[Art Institute of Chicago]] professor [[Lorado Taft]] led a public campaign to restore the building and turn it into another art museum, one devoted to sculpture. The South Park Commissioners (now part of the [[Chicago Park District]]) won approval in a referendum to sell $5 million in bonds to pay for restoration costs, hoping to turn the building into a sculpture museum, a technical trade school, and other things. However, after a few years, the building was selected as the site for a new science museum.

At this time, the [[Commercial Club of Chicago]] was interested in establishing a science museum in Chicago. [[Julius Rosenwald]], the [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]] president and philanthropist, energized his fellow club members by pledging to pay $3 million towards the cost of converting the Palace of Fine Arts (Rosenwald eventually contributed more than $5 million to the project). During its conversion into the MSI, the building's exterior was re-cast in limestone to retain its 1893 [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] look. The interior was replaced with a new one in [[Art Moderne]] style designed by [[Alfred P. Shaw]].

Rosenwald established the museum organization in 1926 but declined to have his name on the building. For the first few years, the museum was often called the Rosenwald Industrial Museum. In 1928, the name of the museum was officially changed to the Museum of Science and Industry. Rosenwald's vision was to create a museum in the style of the [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[Munich]], which he had visited in 1911 while in [[Germany]] with his family.

[[Sewell Avery]], another businessman, had supported the museum within the Commercial Club and was selected as its first president of the board of directors. The museum conducted a nationwide search for the first director. MSI's Board of Directors selected [[Waldemar Kaempffert]], then the science editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', because he shared Rosenwald's vision.

He assembled the museum's curatorial staff and directed the organization and construction of the exhibits. In order to prepare the museum, Kaempffert and his staff visited the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[Kensington]], and the [[Technisches Museum Wien|Technical Museum]] in [[Vienna]], all of which served as models. Kaempffert was instrumental in developing close ties with the science departments of the [[University of Chicago]], which supplied much of the scholarship for the exhibits. Kaempffert resigned in early 1931 amid growing disputes with the second president of the board of directors; they disagreed over the objectivity and neutrality of the exhibits and Kaempffert's management of the staff.

The new Museum of Science and Industry opened to the public in three stages between 1933 and 1940. The first opening ceremony took place during the [[Century of Progress|Century of Progress Exposition]]. Two of the museum's presidents, a number of curators and other staff members, and exhibits came to MSI from the Century of Progress event.

For years, visitors entered the museum through its original main entrance, but that entrance became no longer large enough to handle an increasing volume of visitors. The newer main entrance is a structure detached from the main museum building, through which visitors descend into an underground area and re-ascend into the main building, similar to the [[Louvre Pyramid]].

In 1983, due to increased attendance, the museum started construction of its underground parking lot, located in three underground levels below the front lawn. Construction of the underground parking lot was finished in the 1990s.

For over 55 years, admission to the MSI was free. Fees were first charged in the early 1990s, with general admission rates increasing from $13 in 2008 to $18 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.usa.siemens.biz/press-release/power-transmission/siemens-makes-donation-museum-science-and-industry-chicago|title=Siemens Makes Donation to the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago|date=August 13, 2008|publisher=Siemens Corporation|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MSITickets&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Tickets |url=http://www.msichicago.org/visit/tickets/ |date=2017 |website=Museum of Science and Industry |access-date=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many &quot;free days&quot;—for [[Illinois]] residents only—are offered throughout the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSIFreeDays&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Ticket Prices: 2017 Illinois Free Day Schedule |url=http://www.msichicago.org/visit/ticket-prices/free-days-and-discounts/ |date=2017 |website=Museum of Science and Industry |access-date=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2019, the museum announced that it intends to change its name to the Kenneth C. Griffin Museum of Science and Industry after a donation of $125 million from Chicago billionaire [[Kenneth C. Griffin]]. It is the largest single gift in the museum's history,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2019/10/3/20896953/museum-of-science-industry-changing-name-125-million-gift-ken-griffin|title=Museum of Science and Industry changing name after $125M gift from Ken Griffin|first=Mitch|last=Dudek|date=October 3, 2019|website=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msichicago.org/support/historic-gift/|title=Historic Gift|website=www.msichicago.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively doubling its endowment. However, president and chief executive officer David Mosena said the formal name change could take some time, due to the complexity of the process. He also said part of the gift will go into funding &quot;a state-of-the-art digital gallery and performance space that will be the only experience of its kind in North America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/ct-ent-museum-science-industry-kenneth-griffin-name-change-1004-20191003-z3oajjlmerg5feqf3otuovztxi-story.html|title=The Museum of Science and Industry is getting a new name after Chicago billionaire Ken Griffin donates $125 million|last=Johnson|first=Steve|date=October 3, 2019|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=October 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has over 2,000 exhibits, displayed in 75 major halls. The museum has several major permanent exhibits. Access to several of the exhibits (including the Coal Mine and ''U-505'') requires the payment of an additional fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSITickets&quot; /&gt;

===Entry Hall===
The first diesel-powered streamlined stainless-steel train, the ''[[Pioneer Zephyr]]'', is on permanent display in the Great Hall, renamed the Entry Hall in 2008. The train was once displayed outdoors, and restored and placed in the former Great Hall during the construction of the museum's underground parking lot. Today, a complimentary tour goes through it every 10–20 minutes.

===Lower Level===
====U-505====
{{GS|U-505}} is one of just six German submarines captured by the Allies during [[World War II]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Defeating the Sharks: The Capture of U-505 |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/wars-conflicts-and-operations/world-war-ii/1944/u-505-capture.html |publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command |accessdate=16 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and, since its arrival in 1954, the only one on display in the Western Hemisphere, as well as the only one in the United States. The U-boat was newly restored beginning in 2004 after 50 years of being displayed outdoors, and was then moved indoors as &quot;The New U-505 Experience&quot; on June 5, 2005. Displayed in an underground shed, it remains as a popular exhibit for visitors, as well as a memorial to all the casualties of the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II.

====Henry Crown Space Center====
MSI's [[Henry Crown Space Center]] includes the [[Apollo 8]] spacecraft, which flew the first mission beyond low earth orbit to the Moon, enabling its crew, [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] and [[William Anders]], to become the first human beings to see the Earth as a whole, as well as becoming the first to view the Moon up close (as well as the first to view its far side). Other exhibits include [[Scott Carpenter]]'s [[Mercury-Atlas 7]] spacecraft, a Mars Rover (which you can actually control), a [[lunar module]] trainer and a life-size mockup of [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]].

Located in the [[Henry Crown Space Center]] is a domed theater, considered to be the only domed theater in Chicago. The screen of the theater is made of perforated aluminum, allowing the speakers mounted behind the screen to be heard throughout the theater.

====FarmTech====
The &quot;FarmTech&quot; exhibit showcases modern agricultural techniques and how farmers use modern technology like GPS systems to improve work on the farm, and includes a [[tractor]] and a [[combine harvester]] from [[John Deere]]. The exhibit also showcases a greenhouse, a mock up of a kitchen showcasing much the foods we eat is soybean, and how we use cows, from energy to what we drink.

====Other====
A transportation gallery is located on the museum's west wing, containing models of &quot;Ships Through the Ages&quot; and several historic racing cars.

&quot;Future Energy Chicago&quot; shows alternative resources, housing developments, and the future of [[Chicago]]. The exhibit requires an additional fee.

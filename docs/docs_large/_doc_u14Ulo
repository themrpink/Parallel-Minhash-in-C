For a topological space ''X'', the collection of all Borel sets on ''X'' forms a [[sigma-algebra|&amp;sigma;-algebra]], known as the '''Borel algebra''' or '''Borel &amp;sigma;-algebra'''.  The Borel algebra on ''X'' is the smallest σ-algebra containing all open sets (or, equivalently, all closed sets).

Borel sets are important in [[measure theory]], since any measure defined on the open sets of a space, or on the closed sets of a space, must also be defined on all Borel sets of that space. Any measure defined on the Borel sets is called a [[Borel measure]].  Borel sets and the associated [[Borel hierarchy]] also play a fundamental role in [[descriptive set theory]].

In some contexts, Borel sets are defined to be generated by the [[compact set]]s of the topological space, rather than the open sets. The two definitions are equivalent for many [[well-behaved]] spaces, including all [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[σ-compact space]]s, but can be different in more [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] spaces.

== Generating the Borel algebra ==

In the case that ''X'' is a [[metric space]], the Borel algebra in the first sense may be described ''generatively'' as follows.

For a collection ''T'' of subsets of ''X'' (that is, for any subset of the [[power set]] P(''X'') of ''X''), let
* &lt;math&gt;T_\sigma &lt;/math&gt; be all countable unions of elements of ''T''
* &lt;math&gt;T_\delta &lt;/math&gt; be all countable intersections of elements of ''T''
* &lt;math&gt;T_{\delta\sigma}=(T_\delta)_\sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

Now define by [[transfinite induction]] a sequence ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''m'' is an [[ordinal number]], in the following manner:
* For the base case of the definition, let &lt;math&gt; G^0&lt;/math&gt; be the collection of open subsets of ''X''.
* If ''i'' is not a [[limit ordinal]], then ''i'' has an immediately preceding ordinal ''i &amp;minus; 1''. Let 
*: &lt;math&gt; G^i = [G^{i-1}]_{\delta \sigma}.&lt;/math&gt;
* If ''i'' is a limit ordinal, set
*:&lt;math&gt; G^i = \bigcup_{j &lt; i} G^j. &lt;/math&gt;

The claim is that the Borel algebra is ''G''&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, where ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[first uncountable ordinal|first uncountable ordinal number]]. That is, the Borel algebra can be ''generated'' from the class of open sets by iterating the operation

:&lt;math&gt; G \mapsto G_{\delta \sigma}. &lt;/math&gt;

to the first uncountable ordinal.

To prove this claim, note that any open set in a metric space is the union of an increasing sequence of closed sets. In particular, complementation of sets maps ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' into itself for any limit ordinal  ''m''; moreover if ''m'' is an uncountable limit ordinal, ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' is closed under countable unions.

Note that for each Borel set ''B'', there is some countable ordinal &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''B'' can be obtained by iterating the operation over &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. However, as ''B'' varies over all Borel sets, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; will vary over all the countable ordinals, and thus the first ordinal at which all the Borel sets are obtained is &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the first uncountable ordinal.

=== Example ===
An important example, especially in the [[probability theory|theory of probability]], is the Borel algebra on the set of [[real number]]s. It is the algebra on which the [[Borel measure]] is defined.  Given a [[Random_variable#Real-valued_random_variables|real random variable]] defined on a [[probability space]], its  [[probability distribution]] is by definition also a measure on the Borel algebra.

The Borel algebra on the reals is the smallest σ-algebra on '''R''' that contains all the [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]].

In the construction by transfinite induction, it can be shown that, in each step, the [[cardinality|number]] of sets is, at most, the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. So, the total number of Borel sets is less than or equal to
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_1 \cdot 2 ^ {\aleph_0}\, = 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact, the cardinality of the collection of Borel sets is equal to that of the continuum (compare to the number of [[Lebesgue measurable]] sets that exist, which is strictly larger and equal to &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt;).

Let ''X'' be a topological space. The '''Borel space''' associated to ''X'' is the pair (''X'',''B''), where ''B'' is the σ-algebra of Borel sets of ''X''.

[[George Mackey]] defined a Borel space somewhat differently, writing that it is &quot;a set together with a distinguished σ-field of subsets called its Borel sets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Mackey| first=G.W. | title=Ergodic  Theory  and Virtual  Groups |  year=1966 | journal=Math. Ann.|volume=166|pages=187&amp;ndash;207|issue=3|authorlink=George Mackey|doi=10.1007/BF01361167|issn=0025-5831}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern usage is to call the distinguished sub-algebra the ''measurable sets'' and such spaces [[measurable space|''measurable spaces'']]. The reason for this distinction is that the Borel sets are the σ-algebra generated by ''open'' sets (of a topological space), whereas Mackey's definition refers to a set equipped with an ''arbitrary'' σ-algebra. There exist measurable spaces that are not Borel spaces, for any choice of topology on the underlying space.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mathoverflow.net/q/87888 Jochen Wengenroth, Is every sigma-algebra the Borel algebra of a topology?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurable spaces form a [[category (mathematics)|category]] in which the [[morphism]]s are [[measurable function]]s between measurable spaces. A function &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[measurable function|measurable]] if it [[pullback|pulls back]] measurable sets, i.e., for all measurable sets ''B'' in ''Y'', the set &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; is measurable in ''X''.

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''X'' be a [[Polish space]], that is, a topological space such that there is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] ''d'' on ''X'' that defines the topology of ''X'' and that makes ''X'' a complete [[separable space|separable]] metric space.  Then ''X'' as a Borel  space is [[isomorphic]] to one of
# '''R''', 
# '''Z''', 
# a finite space. 
(This result is reminiscent of [[Maharam's theorem]].)

Considered as Borel spaces, the real line '''R''', the union of '''R''' with a countable set, and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; are isomorphic.

A '''[[standard Borel space]]''' is the Borel space associated to a [[Polish space]]. A standard Borel space is characterized up to isomorphism by its cardinality,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Srivastava| first=S.M. | title=A Course on Borel Sets |  year=1991 | publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] | isbn=978-0-387-98412-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and any uncountable standard Borel space has the cardinality of the continuum.

For subsets of Polish spaces, Borel sets can be characterized as those sets that are the ranges of continuous injective maps defined on Polish spaces.  Note however, that the range of a continuous noninjective map may fail to be Borel.  See [[analytic set]].

Every [[probability measure]] on a standard Borel space turns it into a [[standard probability space]].

== Non-Borel sets ==
{{anchor|counterexample}}

An example of a subset of the reals that is non-Borel, due to [[Nikolai Luzin|Lusin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language=fr | last=Lusin | first=Nicolas | year=1927 | title=Sur les ensembles analytiques | journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae | volume=10 |url=https://www.impan.pl/en/publishing-house/journals-and-series/fundamenta-mathematicae/all/25/0/93222/sur-les-ensembles-analytiques-nuls|pages=Sect. 62, pages 76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; is described below. In contrast, an example of a [[non-measurable set]] cannot be exhibited, though its existence can be proved.

Every [[irrational number]] has a unique representation by an infinite [[continued fraction]]

:&lt;math&gt;x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cfrac{1}{\ddots\,}}}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is some [[integer]] and all the other numbers &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; are ''positive'' integers. Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all irrational numbers that correspond to sequences &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,\dots)&lt;/math&gt; with the following property: there exists an infinite [[subsequence]] &lt;math&gt;(a_{k_0},a_{k_1},\dots)&lt;/math&gt; such that each element is a [[divisor]] of the next element. This set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not Borel. In fact, it is [[analytic set|analytic]], and complete in the class of analytic sets. For more details see [[descriptive set theory]] and the book by [[Alexander S. Kechris|Kechris]], especially Exercise (27.2) on page 209, Definition (22.9) on page 169, and Exercise (3.4)(ii) on page 14.

It's important to note, that while &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed in ZF, it cannot be proven to be non-Borel in ZF alone. In fact, it is consistent with ZF that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a countable union of countable sets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jech |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Jech |date=2008 |title=The Axiom of Choice | pages=142| publisher=Courier Corporation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that any subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a Borel set.

Another non-Borel set is an inverse image &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}[0]&lt;/math&gt; of an [[Parity function#Infinite parity function|infinite parity function]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{0, 1\}^{\omega} \to \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;. However, this is a proof of existence (via the axiom of choice), not an explicit example.

==Alternative non-equivalent definitions==

According to [[Paul Halmos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Halmos|1950|loc=page 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subset of a locally compact Hausdorff topological space is called a ''Borel set'' if it belongs to the smallest [[Sigma-ring|σ–ring]] containing all compact sets.

Norberg and Vervaat &lt;ref&gt;Tommy Norberg and Wim Vervaat, Capacities on non-Hausdorff spaces, in: ''Probability and Lattices'', in: CWI Tract, vol. 110, Math. Centrum Centrum Wisk. Inform., Amsterdam, 1997, pp. 133-150&lt;/ref&gt; redefine the Borel algebra of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;–algebra generated by its open subsets and its compact [[Saturated set|saturated subset]]s. This definition is well-suited for applications in the case where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not Hausdorff. It coincides with the usual definition if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[second countable]] or if every compact saturated subset is closed (which is the case in particular if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff).

The '''Professional Association of Diving Instructors''' ('''PADI''') is a  &lt;ref name=cronin /&gt; [[recreational diving]] membership and [[List of diver certification organizations|diver training organization]] founded in 1966 by John Cronin and Ralph Erickson.&lt;ref name=cronin&gt;{{cite web |author=DAN News |publisher=Divers Alert Network |title=PADI CEO &amp; Co-Founder John Cronin Dies at Age 74 |date=2003-07-17 |url=https://www.diversalertnetwork.org/news/Article.aspx?newsid=317 |accessdate=2008-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cronin was originally a [[National Association of Underwater Instructors|NAUI]] instructor who decided to form his own organization with Erickson, and to break [[Recreational diver training|diver training]] down into several modular courses instead of the single universal course then prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tillman, Tom |title=The history of PADI |publisher=Scuba America Historical Foundation |url=http://www.divinghistory.com/id18.html |accessdate=2009-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PADI courses range from entry level to relatively advanced recreational diver certification, several specialized diving skills courses, usually connected with specific equipment or conditions, some diving related informational courses and a range of recreational diving instructor certifications. They also offer various [[technical diving]] courses.  As of January 2019, PADI is reported to have issued 27 million scuba certifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;About PADI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.padi.com/corporate/company-info|title=PADI Statistics|year=2019|publisher=Professional Association of Diving Instructors|accessdate=18 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

== Ownership History ==
In 1966, PADI was founded by John Cronin and Ralph Erickson&lt;ref name=&quot;cronin&quot; /&gt;.

On 9 August 2012, Lincolnshire Management and Providence Equity Partners jointly acquired PADI from Seidler Equity Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mergr.com/lincolnshire-management-acquires-padi-americas|title=Lincolnshire Management Acquires Padi Americas |website=mergr.com|access-date=2019-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Providence Equity Partners acquired majority stake of PADI from Lincolnshire Management.

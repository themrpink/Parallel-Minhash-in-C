Immense sums were spent upon public works,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; in carrying through the comprehensive planning that had come to fruition during his retirement, bringing water to the waterless hills in the [[Acqua Felice]], feeding twenty-seven new fountains; laying out new arteries in Rome, which connected the great basilicas, even setting his engineer-architect Domenico Fontana to replan the [[Colosseum]] as a silk-spinning factory housing its workers.

Inspired by the ideal of the Renaissance city, Pope Sixtus V's ambitious urban reform programme transformed the old environment to emulate the &quot;long straight streets, wide regular spaces, uniformity and repetitiveness of structures, lavish use of commemorative and ornamental elements, and maximum visibility from both linear and circular perspective.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Lettering|url=https://archive.org/details/publicletterings0000petr|url-access=registration|last=Petrucci|first=Armando|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1993|location=Chicago|page=[https://archive.org/details/publicletterings0000petr/page/36 36]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope set no limit to his plans, and achieved much in his short pontificate, always carried through at top speed: the completion of the dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]]; the [[loggia]] of Sixtus in the [[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano]]; the chapel of the Praesepe in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]; additions or repairs to the [[Quirinal]], [[Lateran]] and [[Vatican City|Vatican]] palaces; the erection of four [[obelisk]]s, including that in [[Saint Peter's Square]]; the opening of six streets; the restoration of the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] of [[Septimius Severus]] (&quot;[[Acqua Felice]]&quot;);&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; the integration of the [[Leonine City]] in Rome as XIV [[rione]] ([[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-117 Della trasportatione dell'obelisco Vaticano et delle fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V, fatte dal caualier Domenico Fontana architetto di Sua Santita, In Roma, 1590]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides numerous roads and bridges,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; he sweetened the city air by financing the reclamation of the [[Pontine Marshes]]. Consequently, the spatial organization, monumental inscriptions and restorations throughout the city reinforced the control, surveillance, and authority that alluded to the power of Pope Sixtus&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drucker|first=Johanna|year=2010|title=Species of Espaces and other spurious concepts addressed to reading invisible features of signs within systems of relations|journal=Design and Culture|volume=2|issue=2|pages=135–153|doi=10.2752/175470710X12696138525541|s2cid=144253902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good progress was made with more than {{convert|9500|acre|km2}} reclaimed and opened to agriculture and manufacture. The project was abandoned upon his death.

Sixtus had no appreciation of antiquities, which were employed as raw material to serve his urbanistic and Christianising programs: [[Trajan's Column]] and the [[Column of Marcus Aurelius]] (at the time misidentified as the [[Column of Antoninus Pius]]) were made to serve as pedestals for the statues of SS Peter and Paul; the [[Minerva]] of the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]] was converted into an emblem of ''Christian Rome''; the [[Septizodium]] of [[Septimius Severus]] was demolished for its building materials.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Church administration===
The subsequent administrative system of the Catholic Church owed much to Sixtus. He limited the [[College of Cardinals]] to seventy. He doubled the number of the congregations and enlarged their functions, assigning to them the principal role in the transaction of business (1588). He regarded the [[Jesuits]] with disfavour and suspicion. He meditated radical changes to their constitution, but death prevented the execution of his purpose.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In 1588 he established the 15 [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|congregations]] by his constitution ''[[Immensa Aeterni Dei]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In May 1587, the [[Sixtine Septuagint]] was published under the auspices of Sixtus V.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ftp.ccel.org/ccel/swete/greekot.iii.vi.html|title=Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek.

In May 1590 the [[Sixtine Vulgate]] was issued.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Early Versions of the New Testament|last=Metzger|first=Bruce M.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1977|location=Oxford|pages=348|author-link=Bruce M. Metzger|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The edition was preceded by the Bull ''[https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Aeternus_Ille Aeternus Ille]'', in which the Pope declared the authenticity of the new Bible.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internationalstandardbible.com/V/vulgate.html|title=Vulgate in the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia.|website=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Online|language=en|access-date=17 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yk1CKgPRKtAC&amp;pg=PA881|title=A Dictionary of the Bible|last=Hastings|first=James|date=2004|publisher=University Press of the Pacific|isbn=978-1-4102-1729-5|volume=4, part 2 (Shimrath - Zuzim)|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|page=881|language=en|chapter=Vulgate|author-link=James Hastings|orig-year=1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bull stipulated &quot;that it was to be considered as the authentic edition recommended by the [[Council of Trent]], that it should be taken as the standard of all future reprints, and that all copies should be corrected by it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament|last=Scrivener|first=Frederick Henry Ambrose|author2=Edward Miller|publisher=[[George Bell &amp; Sons]]|year=1894|edition=4|volume=2|location=London|page=64|authorlink=Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener|url-status=live|title-link=A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;This edition was not to be reprinted for 10 years except at the Vatican, and after that any edition must be compared with the Vatican edition, so that &quot;not even the smallest particle should be altered, added or removed&quot; under pain of the &quot;greater [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]].&quot;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

===Consistories===
{{main|Cardinals created by Sixtus V}}
Sixtus V created 33 cardinals in eight consistories during his reign, which included his grandnephew [[Alessandro Peretti di Montalto]] and his future successor [[Pope Clement VIII|Ippolito Aldobrandini]] who would later become Pope Clement VIII.

===Foreign relations===
[[File:Emanuel van Meteren Historie ppn 051504510 MG 8749 sixtus de vijfde.tif|thumb|Pope Sixtus V]]
In his larger political relations, Sixtus entertained fantastic ambitions, such as the annihilation of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], the conquest of [[Egypt]], the transport of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] to Italy, and the accession of his nephew to the throne of France. The situation in which he found himself was difficult: he could not countenance the designs of those he considered as heretical princes, and yet he mistrusted [[Philip II of Spain]] and viewed with apprehension any extension of his power.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Sixtus agreed to renew the [[excommunication]] of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], and to grant a large subsidy to the [[Spanish Armada|Armada]] of Philip II, but, knowing the slowness of Spain, would give nothing until the expedition actually landed in England. This way, he saved a fortune that would otherwise have been lost in the failed campaign. Sixtus had Cardinal [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Allen]] draw up the ''[[An Admonition to the Nobility and People of England and Ireland]]'', a proclamation to be published in England if the invasion had been successful. The extant document comprised all that could be said against Elizabeth I, and the indictment is therefore fuller and more forcible than any other put forward by the religious exiles, who were generally very reticent in their complaints. Allen carefully consigned his publication to the fire, and we only know of it through one of Elizabeth's spies, who had stolen a copy.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic encyclopedia'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01727c.htm Spanish Armada]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixtus excommunicated [[Henry of Navarre]] (future Henry IV of France),&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Knecht, ''Hero or Tyrant? Henry III, King of France, 1574-89'', (Routledge, 2016), 238.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], but he chafed under his forced alliance with Philip II of Spain, and looked for escape. The victories of Henry and the prospect of his conversion to Catholicism raised Sixtus V's hopes, and in corresponding degree determined Philip II to tighten his grip upon his wavering ally. The Pope's negotiations with Henry's representative evoked a bitter and menacing protest and a categorical demand for the performance of promises. Sixtus took refuge in evasion, and temporised until his death on 27 August 1590.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Vittoria Accoramboni affair===
In 1581 Francesco Peretti, the nephew of the then Cardinal Montalto, had married [[Vittoria Accoramboni]], a woman famous for her great beauty and accomplishments who had many admirers. The future pope's nephew was, however, soon assassinated, and his widow married the powerful [[Paolo Giordano I Orsini]], Duke of [[Bracciano]], who was widely considered to have been involved in the killing of her first husband.

On becoming pope, Sixtus V immediately vowed vengeance on both the Duke of Bracciano and Vittoria Accoramboni. Warned in time, they fled – first to [[Venice]] and then to [[Salò]] in Venetian territory. Here the Duke of Bracciano died in November 1585, bequeathing all his personal property to his widow. A month later Vittoria Accoramboni, who went to live in Padua, was assassinated by a band of [[bravi]] hired by Lodovico Orsini, a relative of her late husband.

===Contraception, abortion, adultery===
Sixtus extended the penalty of excommunication relating to the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on contraception and abortion. While the Church taught that abortion and contraception were gravely sinful actions (&quot;mortal sins&quot;), it did not apply to all mortal sins the additional penalty of [[excommunication]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. Although homicide had always required this penalty, contraception had not. Patristic and Medieval theologians and physicians had long speculated and debated over the exact moment the fertilised egg became a human being.

While there was broad agreement among them that life was present at conception and that it could only become a human being, the thinking was that this did not necessarily mean God had infused the rational, immortal soul into the body at conception. Following [[Aristotle]], many in the West had theorized that the matter had to be prepared to a certain point before this could happen and, prior to then, there was only a vegetative or sensitive soul, but not a human soul. This meant that killing an organism before the human soul is infused would still be a grave sin of abortion (or at least contraception), but that it was not properly a homicide and, thus, did not require excommunication{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.

Some theologians argued that only after proof of the &quot;quickening&quot; (when the mother can feel the fetus's movement in her womb, usually about 20 weeks into gestation) that there was incontrovertible evidence that ensoulment had already occurred. Until Sixtus V, canon lawyers had applied the code from [[Gratian]] whereby excommunications were only given to abortions after the quickening. In 1588 the pope issued a papal bull, ''Effraenatam'' or ''Effrenatam'' (&quot;Without Restraint&quot;), which declared that the canonical penalty of excommunication would be levied for any form of contraception and for abortions at any stage in fetal development.&lt;ref name=&quot;faculty.cua.edu&quot;&gt;[http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Law111/CatholicHistory.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218195040/http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Law111/CatholicHistory.htm |date=18 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning on the latter would be that the soul of the unborn child would be denied Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effraenatam in English|url=http://iteadjmj.com/aborto/eng-prn.html|quote=Who will not detest such an abhorrent and evil act, by which are lost not only the bodies but also the souls? (Popes believe in the limbo of the little ones) Who will not condemn to a most grave punishment the impiety of him who will exclude a soul created in the image of God and for which Our Lord Jesus Christ has shed His precious Blood, and which is capable of eternal happiness and is destined to be in the company of angels, from the blessed vision of God, and who has impeded as much as he could the filling up of heavenly mansions (left vacant by the fallen angels), and has taken away the service to God by His creature?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixtus also attempted in 1586 to introduce into the secular law in Rome the [[Old Testament]] penalty for [[adultery]], that is death. The measure ultimately failed.&lt;ref&gt;Diarmuid MacCulloch, ''Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490–1700'' (London, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
Sixtus V died on 27 August 1590 from [[malarial fever]]. He was the last Pope to date to use the name Sixtus. The pope became ill with a fever on 24 August and which intensified the following day.

As Sixtus V lay on his death bed, he was loathed by his political subjects, but history has recognized him as one of the most important popes. On the negative side, he could be impulsive, obstinate, severe, and autocratic. On the positive side, he was open to large ideas and threw himself into his undertakings with energy and determination; this often led to success. His pontificate saw great enterprises and great achievements.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Sixtus |volume=25|first=Theodore Freylinghuysen |last=Collier |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes wrought by Sixtus on the street plan of Rome were documented in a film, ''Rome: Impact of an Idea'', featuring [[Edmund N. Bacon]] and based on sections of his book ''[[Design of Cities]]''.

About 5,000 [[Brigandage|bandits]] were executed by Sixtus V in the five years before his death in 1590, but there were reputedly 27,000 more at liberty throughout [[Central Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv |last=Ruggiero |first=Guido |author-link=Guido Ruggiero |year=2006 |title=A Companion to the Worlds of the Renaissance |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |page=143 |isbn=1-4051-5783-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfCn4RwVUssC&amp;pg=PA143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Schumann'''{{efn|According to Daverio, there is no evidence of the middle name &quot;Alexander&quot; that appears in some sources{{sfn|Daverio|Sams|2001}}}} ({{IPA-de|ˈʃuːman|lang}}; 8 June 1810{{spaced ndash}}29 July 1856) was a German composer, pianist, and influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a [[virtuoso]] pianist. His teacher, [[Friedrich Wieck]], a German pianist, had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing.

In 1840, after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck, who opposed the marriage, Schumann married Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]]. A lifelong partnership in music began, as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy. Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer [[Johannes Brahms]].

Until 1840, Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano. Later, he composed piano and orchestral works, and many [[Lied]]er (songs for voice and piano). He composed four [[Symphony|symphonies]], one [[opera]], and other orchestral, [[choral]], and [[chamber music|chamber]] works. His best-known works include ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', ''[[Kinderszenen]]'', ''[[Kreisleriana]]'', and the ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]''. Schumann was known for infusing his music with characters through motifs, as well as references to works of literature. These characters bled into his editorial writing in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' (New Journal for Music), a [[Leipzig]]-based publication that he co-founded.

Schumann suffered from a [[mental disorder]] that first manifested in 1833 as a severe [[melancholic depression|melancholic depressive]] episode—which recurred several times alternating with phases of &quot;exaltation&quot; and increasingly also delusional ideas of being poisoned or threatened with metallic items. What is now thought to have been a combination of [[bipolar disorder]] and perhaps [[mercury poisoning]] led to &quot;manic&quot; and &quot;depressive&quot; periods in Schumann's compositional productivity. After a suicide attempt in 1854, Schumann was admitted at his own request to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] in [[Endenich]] near [[Bonn]]. Diagnosed with ''psychotic [[melancholia]]'', he died of pneumonia two years later at the age of 46, without recovering from his mental illness.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Schumannhaus ALT.JPG|thumb|left|Schumann's birth house, now the [[Robert Schumann House]], after an anonymous colourized lithograph]]
[[File:Rob.Schumann.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Robert Schumann in the museum of [[Zwickau]]]]
Schumann was born in [[Zwickau]], in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (today [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]]), the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (née Schnabel) and August Schumann.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostwald|1985|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music—undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schumann|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age seven, Schumann began studying general music and piano with Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school. The boy immediately developed a love of music, and worked on his own compositions, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The ''Universal Journal of Music'' 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, &quot;It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody,—ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Himy]], pianist, Recording ''Homage to Schumann'', CD Notes, (Centaur, 2006), CEN 2858, chosen by BBC December 2007 as CD of the month, includes &quot;Kinderscenen&quot;, &quot;Träumerei&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 14, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled ''Portraits of Famous Men''. While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], as well as [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and the [[Tragedy#Ancient Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]]. His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was [[Jean Paul]], a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels ''Juniusabende'', completed in 1826, and ''Selene''.

Schumann's interest in music was sparked by attending a performance of [[Ignaz Moscheles]] playing at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], and he later developed an interest in the works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. His father, who had encouraged his musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16. Thereafter, neither his mother nor his guardian encouraged him to pursue a music career. In 1828, Schumann left high school, and after a trip during which he met the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] in Munich, he left to study law at the University of Leipzig under family pressure. But in Leipzig Schumann instead focused on improvisation, song composition, and writing novels. He also began to seriously study piano with Friedrick Wieck, a well-known piano teacher. In 1829, he continued his law studies in [[Heidelberg]], where he became a lifelong member of [[Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg]].

===1830–34===
[[File:Robert-Schumann-Haus.JPG|thumb|upright|Schumann's music room in Zwickau]]
During [[Eastertide]] 1830, he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer [[Niccolò Paganini]] play in [[Frankfurt]]. In July he wrote to his mother, &quot;My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law.&quot; With her permission, by Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master [[Friedrich Wieck]], who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perrey|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his studies with Wieck, some stories claim that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand. Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger by using a mechanical device that held back one finger while he exercised the others—which was supposed to strengthen the weakest fingers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jensen|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clara Schumann]] discredited the story, saying the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself referred to it as &quot;an affliction of the whole hand.&quot; Some argue that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was not likely caused by a finger strengthening device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| jstor= 954772 | first= Eric| last= Sams | title= Schumann's hand injury| journal= The Musical Times| volume= 112| pages= 1156–1159| number= 1546 |date= December 1971| doi= 10.2307/954772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schumann abandoned the idea of a concert career and devoted himself instead to composition. To this end he began a study of music theory under [[Heinrich Dorn]], a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the [[Leipzig Opera]].

====''Papillons''====

Schumann's fusion of literary ideas with musical ones—known as [[program music]]—may have first taken shape in ''[[Papillons]]'', Op. 2 (''Butterflies''), a musical portrayal of events in [[Jean Paul]]'s novel ''Flegeljahre''. In a letter from Leipzig dated April 1832, Schumann bids his brothers, &quot;Read the last scene in Jean Paul's ''Flegeljahre'' as soon as possible, because the ''Papillons'' are intended as a musical representation of that masquerade.&quot; This inspiration is foreshadowed to some extent in his first written criticism—an 1831 essay on [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s [[Variations on &quot;Là ci darem la mano&quot; (Chopin)|variations on a theme]] from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', published in the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]''. In it, Schumann creates imaginary characters who discuss Chopin's work: Florestan (the embodiment of Schumann's passionate, voluble side) and Eusebius (his dreamy, introspective side)—the counterparts of Vult and Walt in ''Flegeljahre.'' They call on a third, Meister Raro, for his opinion. Raro may represent either the composer himself, Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], or the combination of the two (Cla'''ra''' + '''Ro'''bert).

In the winter of 1832, at age 22, Schumann visited relatives in Zwickau and [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]], where he performed the first movement of his ''Symphony in G minor'' (without opus number, known as the &quot;Zwickauer&quot;). In Zwickau, the music was performed at a concert given by Clara Wieck, who was then just 13 years old. On this occasion Clara played bravura Variations by [[Henri Herz]], a composer whom Schumann was already deriding as a philistine.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schumann, musical Journal&lt;/ref&gt; Schumann's mother said to Clara, &quot;You must marry my Robert one day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Litzmann|1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Symphony in G minor'' was not published during Schumann's lifetime but has been played and recorded in recent times.

The 1833 deaths of Schumann's brother Julius and his sister-in-law Rosalie in the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829-1851)|worldwide cholera pandemic]] brought on a [[Major depressive disorder|severe depressive]] episode.

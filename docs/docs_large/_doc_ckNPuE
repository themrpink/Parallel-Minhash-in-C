'''''Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid''''', also known as '''''GEB''''', is a 1979 book by [[Douglas Hofstadter]]. 
By exploring common themes in the lives and works of logician [[Kurt Gödel]], artist [[M. C. Escher]], and composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], the book expounds concepts fundamental to [[mathematics]], [[symmetry]], and [[intelligence]]. Through illustration and analysis, the book discusses how, through [[self-reference]] and formal rules, systems can acquire meaning despite being made of &quot;meaningless&quot; elements. It also discusses what it means to communicate, how knowledge can be represented and stored, the methods and limitations of symbolic representation, and even the fundamental notion of &quot;meaning&quot; itself.

In response to confusion over the book's theme, Hofstadter emphasized that ''Gödel, Escher, Bach'' is not about the relationships of [[mathematics and art|mathematics, art]], and [[music and mathematics|music]]—but rather about how [[Cognitive science|cognition]] [[emergence|emerges]] from hidden neurological mechanisms. One point in the book presents an analogy about how individual [[neurons]] in the [[brain]] coordinate to create a unified sense of a coherent mind by comparing it to the social organization displayed in a [[Ant colony|colony of ants]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.11/kelly.html By Analogy: A talk with the most remarkable researcher in artificial intelligence today, Douglas Hofstadter, the author of Gödel, Escher, Bach] Wired Magazine, November 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizcharts.com/stoa_del_sol/conscious/conscious2.html|title=Perspective of Mind: Douglas Hofstadter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tagline &quot;a metaphorical [[fugue]] on minds and machines in the spirit of [[Lewis Carroll]]&quot; was used by the publisher to describe the book.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0465026567/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link cover].&lt;/ref&gt;
==Structure==

''Gödel, Escher, Bach'' takes the form of interweaving narratives. The main chapters alternate with dialogues between imaginary characters, usually [[Achilles and the tortoise]], first used by [[Zeno of Elea]] and later by [[Lewis Carroll]] in &quot;[[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles]]&quot;. These origins are related in the first two dialogues, and later ones introduce new characters such as the Crab. These narratives frequently dip into [[self-reference]] and [[metafiction]].

[[Word play]] also features prominently in the work. Puns are occasionally used to connect ideas, such as &quot;the Magnificrab, Indeed&quot; with Bach's ''Magnificat in D''; &quot;[[SHRDLU]], Toy of Man's Designing&quot; with Bach's ''[[Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring]]''; and &quot;[[Typographical Number Theory]]&quot;, or &quot;[[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]&quot;, which inevitably reacts explosively when it attempts to make statements about itself. One dialogue contains a story about a genie (from the Arabic &quot;[[Djinn]]&quot;) and various &quot;tonics&quot; (of both the [[Tonic water|liquid]] and [[Tonic (music)|musical]] varieties), which is titled &quot;[[Gin and tonic|Djinn and Tonic]]&quot;.

One dialogue in the book is written in the form of a [[crab canon]], in which every line before the midpoint corresponds to an identical line past the midpoint. The conversation still makes sense due to uses of common phrases that can be used as either greetings or farewells (&quot;Good day&quot;) and the positioning of lines that double as an answer to a question in the next line. Another is a sloth canon, where one character repeats the lines of another, but slower and negated.

==Themes==

The book contains many instances of [[recursion]] and [[self-reference]], where objects and ideas speak about or refer back to themselves. One is [[Quine (computing)|Quining]], a term Hofstadter invented in homage to [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], referring to programs that produce their own [[source code]]. Another is the presence of a fictional author in the index, [[Egbert B. Gebstadter]], a man with initials E, G, and B and a surname that partially matches Hofstadter. A phonograph dubbed &quot;Record Player X&quot; destroys itself by playing a record titled ''I Cannot Be Played on Record Player X'' (an analogy to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]), an examination of [[canon (music)|canon]] form in [[music]], and a discussion of Escher's [[Drawing Hands|lithograph of two hands drawing each other]]. To describe such self-referencing objects, Hofstadter coins the term &quot;[[strange loop]]&quot;—a concept he examines in more depth in his follow-up book ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]''. To escape many of the logical contradictions brought about by these self-referencing objects, Hofstadter discusses [[Zen]] [[koan]]s. He attempts to show readers how to perceive reality outside their own experience and embrace such paradoxical questions by rejecting the premise—a strategy also called &quot;[[Mu (negative)|unasking]]&quot;.

Elements of [[computer science]] such as [[call stack]]s are also discussed in ''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', as one dialogue describes the adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise as they make use of &quot;pushing potion&quot; and &quot;popping tonic&quot; involving entering and leaving different layers of reality. Subsequent sections discuss the basic tenets of logic, self-referring statements, (&quot;typeless&quot;) systems, and even programming. Hofstadter further creates [[BlooP and FlooP]], two simple [[programming language]]s, to illustrate his point.

==Puzzles==

The book is filled with puzzles, including Hofstadter's famous [[MU puzzle]]. Another example can be found in the chapter titled ''Contracrostipunctus'', which combines the words ''[[acrostic]]'' and ''contrapunctus'' ([[counterpoint]]). In this dialogue between Achilles and the Tortoise, the author hints that there is a contrapunctal acrostic in the chapter that refers both to the author (Hofstadter) and Bach. This can be spelled out by taking the first word of each paragraph, to reveal: '''H'''ofstadter's '''C'''ontracrostipunctus '''A'''crostically '''B'''ackwards '''S'''pells ''''J'''. S. Bach'. The second acrostic is found by taking the first letters of the words (shown in bold), and reading them backwards to get &quot;J S Bach&quot; – just as the acrostic sentence self-referentially claims.

==Reception and impact==

''Gödel, Escher, Bach'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for general non-fiction&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/1980 | title = The Prizes | year = 1980 | publisher = Pulitzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Book Award]] for Science.&lt;ref name=nba1980&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1980 &quot;National Book Awards – 1980&quot;]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;This was the [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science|award for hardcover Science]].  From 1980 to 1983, the [[National Book Award#History|National Book Award history]] gave separate awards to hardcover and paperback books in many categories, including [[National Book Award for Nonfiction|several nonfiction subcategories]]. Most paperback award-winners were reprints of earlier works; the 1980 Science was eligible for both awards as a new book.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gardner]]'s July 1979 column in ''[[Scientific American]]'' stated, &quot;Every few decades, an unknown author brings out a book of such depth, clarity, range, wit, beauty and originality that it is recognized at once as a major literary event.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Somers|first=James|title=The Man Who Would Teach Machines to Think|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[The Atlantic Media Company]]|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Summer 2007, the [[MIT|Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] created an online course for high school students built around the book.&lt;ref name = &quot;MIT&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://ocw.mit.edu/high-school/humanities-and-social-sciences/godel-escher-bach/ | publisher = MIT | title = GEB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its February 19, 2010 investigative summary on the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] suggested that [[Bruce Edwards Ivins]] was inspired by the book to hide secret codes based upon [[nucleotide sequence]]s in the [[anthrax]]-laced letters he allegedly sent in September and October 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/amerithrax/docs/amx-investigative-summary.pdf |title=Amerithrax Investigative Summary |publisher=United States Department of Justice |format=PDF |date=February 19, 2010 |access-date=2010-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128035809/http://www.justice.gov/amerithrax/docs/amx-investigative-summary.pdf |archive-date=2010-11-28 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; using bold letters, as suggested on page 404 of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/amerithrax/docs/j-geb-page-%20404.pdf |title=Page 404 of Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |format=PDF |publisher=United States Department of Justice |access-date=2010-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128035834/http://www.justice.gov/amerithrax/docs/j-geb-page-%20404.pdf |archive-date=2010-11-28 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Willman|Willman, David]] (2011), ''The Mirage Man: Bruce Ivins, the Anthrax Attacks, and America's Rush to War''; [[New York City|New York]]: [[Bantam Books]], pg 300.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that he attempted to hide the book from investigators by throwing it in the trash.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 2019, British mathematician [[Marcus du Sautoy]] curated a series of events at London's [[Barbican Centre]] to celebrate the book's fortieth anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sautoy|first=Marcus du|date=2019-03-09|title=Can AI become conscious?

==Translation==

Hofstadter claims the idea of translating his book &quot;never crossed [his] mind&quot; when he was writing it—but when his publisher brought it up, he was &quot;very excited about seeing [the] book in other languages, especially… French.&quot; He knew, however, that &quot;there were a million issues to consider&quot; when translating,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofstadter_1999_16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hofstadter|1999|p=xxxiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; since the book relies not only on word-play, but on &quot;structural puns&quot; as well—writing where the form and content of the work mirror each other (such as the &quot;[[Crab canon]]&quot; dialogue, which reads almost exactly the same forwards as backwards).

Hofstadter gives an example of translation trouble in the paragraph &quot;Mr. Tortoise, Meet Madame Tortue&quot;, saying translators &quot;instantly ran headlong into the conflict between the feminine gender of the French noun ''tortue'' and the masculinity of my character, the Tortoise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofstadter_1999_16&quot; /&gt; Hofstadter agreed to the translators' suggestions of naming the French character ''Madame Tortue'', and the Italian version ''Signorina Tartaruga''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofstadter_1999_17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hofstadter|1999|pp=xxxiv–xxxv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of other troubles translators might have retaining meaning, Hofstadter &quot;painstakingly went through every sentence of ''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', annotating a copy for translators into any language that might be targeted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofstadter_1999_16&quot; /&gt;

Translation also gave Hofstadter a way to add new meaning and puns. For instance, in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the subtitle is not a translation of ''an Eternal Golden Braid'', but a seemingly unrelated phrase ''Jí Yì Bì'' (集异璧, literally &quot;collection of exotic jades&quot;), which is [[homophone|homophonic]] to ''GEB'' in Chinese. Some material regarding this interplay is in Hofstadter's later book, ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', which is mainly about translation.

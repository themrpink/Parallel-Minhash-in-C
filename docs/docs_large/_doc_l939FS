In the laboratory, calcium fluoride is commonly used as a window material for both [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths, since it is transparent in these regions (about 0.15&amp;nbsp;µm to 9&amp;nbsp;µm) and exhibits an extremely low change in [[refractive index]] with wavelength. Furthermore, the material is attacked by a few reagents. At wavelengths as short as 157&amp;nbsp;nm, a common wavelength used for [[semiconductor]] stepper manufacture for [[integrated circuit]] [[Photolithography|lithography]], the refractive index of calcium fluoride shows some non-linearity at high power densities, which has inhibited its use for this purpose. In the early years of the 21st century, the stepper market for calcium fluoride collapsed, and many large manufacturing facilities have been closed. [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] and other manufacturers have used synthetically grown crystals of calcium fluoride components in lenses to aid [[apochromatic]] design, and to reduce [[Dispersion (optics)|light dispersion]]. This use has largely been superseded by newer glasses and computer-aided design. As an infrared optical material, calcium fluoride is widely available and was sometimes known by the [[Eastman Kodak]] trademarked name &quot;Irtran-3&quot;, although this designation is obsolete.

Fluorite should not be confused with fluoro-crown (or fluorine crown) glass, a type of [[low-dispersion glass]] that has special optical properties approaching fluorite. True fluorite is not a glass but a crystalline material. Lenses or [[List of lens designs|Optical groups]] made using this low dispersion glass as one or more elements exhibit less [[chromatic aberration]] than those utilizing conventional, less expensive [[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]] and [[flint glass]] elements to make an [[achromatic lens]]. Optical groups employ a combination of different types of glass; each type of glass [[Refraction|refracts]] light in a different way. By using combinations of different types of glass, lens manufacturers are able to cancel out or significantly reduce unwanted characteristics; chromatic aberration being the most important. The best of such lens designs are often called apochromatic (see above). Fluoro-crown glass (such as Schott FK51) usually in combination with an appropriate [[Flint glass|&quot;flint&quot; glass]] (such as Schott KzFSN 2) can give very high performance in telescope objective lenses, as well as microscope objectives, and camera telephoto lenses. Fluorite elements are similarly paired with complementary &quot;flint&quot; elements (such as Schott LaK 10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schott.com/advanced_optics/english/knowledge-center/technical-articles-and-tools/abbe-diagramm.html|title=Interactive Abbe Diagram|publisher=SCHOTT AG|year=2019|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refractive qualities or fluorite and of certain flint elements provide a lower and more uniform dispersion across the spectrum of visible light, thereby keeping colors focused more closely together. Lenses made with fluorite are superior to fluoro-crown based lenses, at least for doublet telescope objectives; but are more difficult to produce and more costly.&lt;ref&gt;Rutten, Harrie; van Venrooij, Martin (1988). Telescope Optics Evaluation and Design.  Willmann-Bell, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of fluorite for prisms and lenses was studied and promoted by [[Victor Schumann]] near the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyman&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyman|first=T.|title=Victor Schumann|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=38|pages=1–4|year=1914|doi=10.1086/142050|bibcode=1914ApJ....39....1L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally occurring fluorite crystals without optical defects were only large enough to produce microscope objectives.

With the advent of synthetically grown fluorite crystals in the 1950s - 60s, it could be used instead of glass in some high-performance [[optical telescope]] and [[camera lens]] elements. In telescopes, fluorite elements allow high-resolution images of astronomical objects at high [[magnification]]s. [[Canon Inc.]] produces synthetic fluorite crystals that are used in their better [[telephoto lens]]es. The use of fluorite for telescope lenses has declined since the 1990s, as newer designs using fluoro-crown glass, including triplets, have offered comparable performance at lower prices. Fluorite and various combinations of fluoride compounds can be made into synthetic crystals which have applications in lasers and special optics for UV and infrared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqTkCF6Ra9kC&amp;pg=PA339|page=339|title=Bulk crystal growth of electronic, optical &amp; optoelectronic materials|author=Capper, Peter |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year= 2005|isbn=0-470-85142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure tools for the [[semiconductor]] industry make use of fluorite optical elements for [[ultraviolet light]] at [[wavelength]]s of about 157 [[nanometer]]s. Fluorite has a uniquely high transparency at this wavelength. Fluorite [[Objective (optics)|objective lenses]] are manufactured by the larger microscope firms (Nikon, [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]] and Leica). Their transparence to ultraviolet light enables them to be used for [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescence microscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaQOh28E0vgC&amp;pg=PA157|page=157|title=Photography with a microscope|author1=Rost, F. W. D.  |author2=Oldfield, Ronald Jowett |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-521-77096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fluorite also serves to correct [[optical aberration]]s in these lenses. [[Nikon]] has previously manufactured at least one fluorite and synthetic quartz element camera lens (105&amp;nbsp;mm f/4.5 UV) for the production of [[ultraviolet photography|ultraviolet images]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEFPNfghI3QC&amp;pg=PA388|pages=387–388|title=Scientific photography and applied imaging|author=Ray, Sidney F. |publisher=Focal Press|year=1999|isbn=0-240-51323-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Konica]] produced a fluorite lens for their SLR cameras – the Hexanon 300&amp;nbsp;mm f/6.3.

==Source of fluorine gas in nature==
In 2012, the first source of naturally occurring fluorine gas was found in fluorite mines in Bavaria, Germany. It was previously thought that [[fluorine gas]] did not occur naturally because it is so reactive and would rapidly react with other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labspaces.net/121513/First_direct_evidence_that_elemental_fluorine_occurs_in_nature First direct evidence that elemental fluorine occurs in nature]. Labspaces.net (2012-07-06). Retrieved on 2013-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorite is normally colorless, but some varied forms found nearby look black and are known as 'fetid fluorite' or [[antozonite]]. The minerals, containing small amounts of [[uranium]] and its daughter products, release radiation sufficiently energetic to induce oxidation of fluoride anions within the structure to fluorine that becomes trapped inside the mineral. The color of fetid fluorite is predominantly due to the [[calcium]] atoms remaining. Solid-state fluorine-19 [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] carried out on the gas contained in the antozonite revealed a peak at 425&amp;nbsp;ppm, which is consistent with F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Withers, Neil (1 July 2012) [http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2012/07/fluorine-finally-found-nature Fluorine finally found in nature |Chemistry World].

[[File:General flux diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|The field lines of a [[vector field]] '''F''' through surfaces with [[unit vector|unit]] normal '''n''', the angle from '''n''' to '''F''' is θ. Flux is a measure of how much of the field passes through a given surface. '''F''' is decomposed into components perpendicular (⊥) and parallel ( ‖ ) to '''n'''. Only the parallel component contributes to flux because it is the maximum extent of the field passing through the surface at a point, the perpendicular component does not contribute. '''Top:''' Three field lines through a plane surface, one normal to the surface, one parallel, and one intermediate.

The flux through each patch is equal to the normal (perpendicular) component of the field, the [[dot product]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; with the unit normal vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; ''(blue arrows)'' at the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the area &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt;.  The sum of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n} dS&lt;/math&gt; for each patch on the surface is the flux through the surface]]

'''Flux''' describes any effect that appears to pass or travel (whether it actually moves or not) through a surface or substance.   A flux is a concept in [[applied mathematics]] and [[vector calculus]] which has many applications to [[physics]].  For [[transport phenomena]], flux is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity, describing the magnitude and direction of the flow of a substance or property. In [[vector calculus]] flux is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity, defined as the [[surface integral]] of the perpendicular component of a [[vector field]] over a surface.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell,p22-26&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The word ''flux'' comes from [[Latin]]: ''fluxus'' means &quot;flow&quot;, and ''fluere'' is &quot;to flow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English | first=Ernest | last=Weekley | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | year=1967 | isbn=0-486-21873-2 | page=581 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; As ''[[Method of Fluxions|fluxion]]'', this term was introduced into [[differential calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]].

The concept of heat flux was a key contribution of [[Joseph Fourier]], in the analysis of heat transfer phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herivel |first1=John |title=Joseph Fourier : the man and the physicist |date=1975 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0198581491 |pages=181–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; His seminal treatise ''Théorie analytique de la chaleur'' (''The Analytical Theory of Heat''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Fourier | first = Joseph | title = Théorie analytique de la chaleur | publisher = Firmin Didot Père et Fils | year = 1822 | location = Paris | language = French | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_TDQJAAAAIAAJ | oclc=2688081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ''fluxion'' as a central quantity and proceeds to derive the now well-known expressions of flux in terms of temperature differences across a slab, and then more generally in terms of temperature gradients or differentials of temperature, across other geometries. One could argue, based on the work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]],&lt;ref name = Maxwell/&gt; that the transport definition precedes the [[Magnetic flux|definition of flux used in electromagnetism]]. The specific quote from Maxwell is:
{{quote|In the case of fluxes, we have to take the integral, over a surface, of the flux through every element of the surface. The result of this operation is called the [[surface integral]] of the flux. It represents the quantity which passes through the surface. |James Clerk Maxwell}}

According to the transport definition, flux may be a single vector, or it may be a vector field / function of position. In the latter case flux can readily be integrated over a surface. By contrast, according to the electromagnetism definition, flux ''is'' the integral over a surface; it makes no sense to integrate a second-definition flux for one would be integrating over a surface twice. Thus, Maxwell's quote only makes sense if &quot;flux&quot; is being used according to the transport definition (and furthermore is a vector field rather than single vector). This is ironic because Maxwell was one of the major developers of what we now call &quot;electric flux&quot; and &quot;magnetic flux&quot; according to the electromagnetism definition. Their names in accordance with the quote (and transport definition) would be &quot;surface integral of electric flux&quot; and &quot;surface integral of magnetic flux&quot;, in which case &quot;electric flux&quot; would instead be defined as &quot;electric field&quot; and &quot;magnetic flux&quot; defined as &quot;magnetic field&quot;. This implies that Maxwell conceived of these fields as  flows/fluxes of some sort.

Given a flux according to the electromagnetism definition, the corresponding '''flux density''', if that term is used, refers to its derivative along the surface that was integrated. By the [[Fundamental theorem of calculus]], the corresponding '''flux density''' is a flux according to the transport definition. Given a '''current''' such as electric current—charge per time, '''current density''' would also be a flux according to the transport definition—charge per time per area. Due to the conflicting definitions of ''flux'', and the interchangeability of ''flux'', ''flow'', and ''current'' in nontechnical English, all of the terms used in this paragraph are sometimes used interchangeably and ambiguously. Concrete fluxes in the rest of this article will be used in accordance to their broad acceptance in the literature, regardless of which definition of flux the term corresponds to.

== Flux as flow rate per unit area ==
In [[transport phenomena]] ([[heat transfer]], [[mass transfer]] and [[fluid dynamics]]), flux is defined as the ''rate of flow of a property per unit area,'' which has the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] [quantity]·[time]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·[area]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=R. Byron | last=Bird | authorlink=Robert Byron Bird | author2=Stewart, Warren E. | author3=[[Edwin N. Lightfoot|Lightfoot, Edwin N.]] | year=1960 | title=Transport Phenomena | publisher=Wiley | isbn=0-471-07392-X | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/transportphenome00bird }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is of the surface the property is flowing &quot;through&quot; or &quot;across&quot;. For example, the magnitude of a river's current, i.e. the amount of water that flows through a cross-section of the river each second, or the amount of sunlight energy that lands on a patch of ground each second, are kinds of flux.

=== General mathematical definition (transport) ===
Here are 3 definitions in increasing order of complexity. Each is a special case of the following. In all cases the frequent symbol ''j'', (or ''J'') is used for flux, ''q'' for the [[physical quantity]] that flows, ''t'' for time, and ''A'' for area. These identifiers will be written in bold when and only when they are vectors.

First, flux as a (single) scalar:
:&lt;math&gt;j = \frac{I}{A}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;I = \lim\limits_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta q}{ \Delta t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;
In this case the surface in which flux is being measured is fixed, and has area ''A''. The surface is assumed to be flat, and the flow is assumed to be everywhere constant with respect to position, and perpendicular to the surface.

Second, flux as a [[scalar field]] defined along a surface, i.e. a function of points on the surface:
:&lt;math&gt;j(\mathbf{p}) = \frac{\partial I}{\partial A}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I(A,\mathbf{p}) = \frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}(A,\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt;
As before, the surface is assumed to be flat, and the flow is assumed to be everywhere perpendicular to it. However the flow need not be constant. ''q'' is now a function of '''p''', a point on the surface, and ''A'', an area. Rather than measure the total flow through the surface, q measures the flow through the disk with area ''A'' centered at ''p'' along the surface.

Finally, flux as a [[vector field]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{p}) = \frac{\partial \mathbf{I}}{\partial A}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}(A,\mathbf{p}) = \underset{\mathbf{\hat{n}}}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\, \mathbf{\hat{n}}_{\mathbf p} \frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}(A,\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{\hat{n}})&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, there is no fixed surface we are measuring over. ''q'' is a function of a point, an area, and a direction (given by a unit vector, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;), and measures the flow through the disk of area A perpendicular to that unit vector. ''I'' is defined picking the unit vector that maximizes the flow around the point, because the true flow is maximized across the disk that is perpendicular to it. The unit vector thus uniquely maximizes the function when it points in the &quot;true direction&quot; of the flow. [Strictly speaking, this is an [[abuse of notation]] because the &quot;arg max&quot; cannot directly compare vectors; we take the vector with the biggest norm instead.]

==== Properties ====

These direct definitions, especially the last, are rather unwieldy. For example, the argmax construction is artificial from the perspective of empirical measurements, when with a [[Weathervane]] or similar one can easily deduce the direction of flux at a point. Rather than defining the vector flux directly, it is often more intuitive to state some properties about it. Furthermore, from these properties the flux can uniquely be determined anyway.

If the flux '''j''' passes through the area at an angle θ to the area normal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}= j\cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;
where '''·''' is the [[dot product]] of the unit vectors. This is, the component of flux passing through the surface (i.e. normal to it) is ''j'' cos θ, while the component of flux passing tangential to the area is ''j'' sin θ, but there is ''no'' flux actually passing ''through'' the area in the tangential direction. The ''only'' component of flux passing normal to the area is the cosine component.

For vector flux, the [[surface integral]] of '''j''' over a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] ''S'', gives the proper flowing per unit of time through the surface.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t} =\iint_S \mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}\,{\rm d}A\ = \iint_S \mathbf{j}\cdot{\rm d}\mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;
'''A''' (and its infinitesimal) is the [[vector area]],  combination of the magnitude of the area through which the property passes, ''A'', and a [[unit vector]] normal to the area, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. The relation is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A \mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Unlike in the second set of equations, the surface here need not be flat.

Finally, we can integrate again over the time duration ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, getting the total amount of the property flowing through the surface in that time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;q=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\iint_S \mathbf{j}\cdot{\rm d}{\mathbf A}\,{\rm d}t &lt;/math&gt;

=== Transport fluxes ===
Eight of the most common forms of flux from the transport phenomena literature are defined as follows:

# [[Transport phenomena#Momentum transfer|Momentum flux]], the rate of transfer of [[momentum]] across a unit area (N·s·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). ([[viscosity|Newton's law of viscosity]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics P.M&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Essential Principles of Physics|author1=P.M. Whelan |author2=M.J. Hodgeson |edition=2nd|year=1978|publisher=John Murray|isbn=0-7195-3382-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Heat flux]], the rate of [[heat]] flow across a unit area (J·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). ([[Heat conduction|Fourier's law of conduction]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Carslaw | first=H.S. |author2=Jaeger, J.C. | title=Conduction of Heat in Solids  | edition=Second | year=1959 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-853303-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This definition of heat flux fits Maxwell's original definition.)&lt;ref name = Maxwell/&gt;
# [[Diffusion flux]], the rate of movement of molecules across a unit area (mol·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). ([[Fick's law of diffusion]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics P.M&quot;/&gt;
# [[Volumetric flux]], the rate of [[volume]] flow across a unit area (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). ([[Darcy's law|Darcy's law of groundwater flow]])
# [[Mass flux]], the rate of [[mass]] flow across a unit area (kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). (Either an alternate form of Fick's law that includes the molecular mass, or an alternate form of Darcy's law that includes the density.)
# [[Radiative flux]], the amount of energy transferred in the form of [[photons]] at a certain distance from the source per unit area per second (J·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Used in astronomy to determine the [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] and [[spectral class]] of a star.  Also acts as a generalization of heat flux, which is equal to the radiative flux when restricted to the electromagnetic spectrum.
# [[Energy flux]], the rate of transfer of [[energy]] through a unit area (J·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). The radiative flux and heat flux are specific cases of energy flux.
# [[Particle flux]], the rate of transfer of particles through a unit area ([number of particles] m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)

These fluxes are vectors at each point in space, and have a definite magnitude and direction. Also, one can take the [[divergence]] of any of these fluxes to determine the accumulation rate of the quantity in a control volume around a given point in space.  For [[incompressible flow]], the divergence of the volume flux is zero.

==== Chemical diffusion ====
As mentioned above, chemical [[mass flux#Molar fluxes|molar flux]] of a component A in an [[isothermal]], [[Isobaric process|isobaric system]] is defined in [[Fick's law of diffusion]] as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_A = -D_{AB} \nabla c_A&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[nabla symbol]] ∇ denotes the [[gradient]] operator, ''D&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the diffusion coefficient (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) of component A diffusing through component B, ''c&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[concentration]] ([[mole (unit)|mol]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of component A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Welty | authorlink= |author2=Wicks, Wilson and Rorrer | year=2001 | title=Fundamentals of Momentum, Heat, and Mass Transfer | edition=4th | publisher=Wiley | isbn=0-471-38149-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flux has units of mol·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and fits Maxwell's original definition of flux.&lt;ref name=Maxwell&gt;{{cite book | last=Maxwell | first=James Clerk| authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell | year=1892 | title=Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism | isbn=0-486-60636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For dilute gases, kinetic molecular theory relates the diffusion coefficient ''D'' to the particle density ''n'' = ''N''/''V'', the molecular mass ''m'', the collision [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] ''T'' by
:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{2}{3 n\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{kT}{\pi m}}&lt;/math&gt;
where the second factor is the [[mean free path]] and the square root (with [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]] ''k'') is the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution#Typical speeds|mean velocity]] of the particles.

In turbulent flows, the transport by eddy motion can be expressed as a grossly increased diffusion coefficient.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
{{Main|Probability current}}

In [[quantum mechanics]], particles of mass ''m'' in the [[quantum state]] ψ('''r''', t) have a [[probability amplitude|probability density]] defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \psi^* \psi = |\psi|^2. \,&lt;/math&gt;
So the probability of finding a particle in a differential [[volume element]] d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''r''' is
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm d}P = |\psi|^2 {\rm d}^3\mathbf{r}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Then the number of particles passing perpendicularly through unit area of a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] per unit time is the probability flux;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \frac{i \hbar}{2m} \left(\psi \nabla \psi^* - \psi^* \nabla \psi \right). \,&lt;/math&gt;
This is sometimes referred to as the probability current or current density,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics Demystified|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780071471411|url-access=registration|author=D.

== Flux as a surface integral ==
[[Image:Flux diagram.png|thumb|The flux visualized. The rings show the surface boundaries. The red arrows stand for the flow of charges, fluid particles, subatomic particles, photons, etc. The number of arrows that pass through each ring is the flux.]]

=== General mathematical definition (surface integral) ===
As a mathematical concept, flux is represented by the [[surface integral#Surface integrals of vector fields|surface integral of a vector field]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vector Analysis|edition=2nd|author1=M.R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipcshutz |author3=D. Spellman |series=Schaum's Outlines|page=100|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2009|isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_F=\iint_A\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_F=\iint_A\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n}\mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt;

where '''F''' is a [[vector field]], and d''A'' is the [[vector area]] of the surface ''A'', directed as the [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]]. For the second, '''n''' is the outward pointed [[unit normal vector]] to the surface.

The surface has to be [[orientability|orientable]], i.e. two sides can be distinguished: the surface does not fold back onto itself. Also, the surface has to be actually oriented, i.e. we use a convention as to flowing which way is counted positive; flowing backward is then counted negative.

The surface normal is usually directed by the [[right-hand rule]].

Conversely, one can consider the flux the more fundamental quantity and call the vector field the flux density.

Often a vector field is drawn by curves (field lines) following the &quot;flow&quot;; the magnitude of the vector field is then the line density, and the flux through a surface is the number of lines. Lines originate from areas of positive [[divergence]] (sources) and end at areas of negative divergence (sinks).

See also the image at right: the number of red arrows passing through a unit area is the flux density, the [[curve]] encircling the red arrows denotes the boundary of the surface, and the orientation of the arrows with respect to the surface denotes the sign of the [[inner product]] of the vector field with the surface normals.

If the surface encloses a 3D region, usually the surface is oriented such that the '''influx''' is counted positive; the opposite is the '''outflux'''.

The [[divergence theorem]] states that the net outflux through a closed surface, in other words the net outflux from a 3D region, is found by adding the local net outflow from each point in the region (which is expressed by the [[divergence]]).

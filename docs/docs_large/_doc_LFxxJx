===Café vs. home preparation===
[[File:2018 0121 Quick Mill 0820 espresso machine.jpg|thumb|A Quickmill 820 home espresso machine]]
Home espresso machines have increased in popularity with the general rise of interest in espresso. Today, a wide range of home espresso equipment can be found in kitchen and appliance stores, online vendors, and department stores. The first espresso machine for home use was the [[Gaggia]] Gilda.{{sfn|Bersten|1993|page=131}} Soon afterwards, similar machines such as the Faema Faemina, FE-AR La Peppina and VAM Caravel followed suit in similar form factor and operational principles.{{sfn|Bersten|1993|page=132-133}} These machines still have a small but dedicated share of fans. Until the advent of the first small electrical pump-based espresso machines such as the Gaggia Baby and Quickmill 810, home espresso machines were not widely adopted. In recent years, the increased availability of convenient counter-top fully automatic home espresso makers and pod-based espresso serving systems has increased the quantity of espresso consumed at home. The popularity of home espresso making parallels the increase of [[home roasting coffee|home coffee roasting]]. Some amateurs pursue both [[home roasting coffee]] and making espresso.

==Etymology and spelling==
[[File:Italian-American cafe espresso shop on MacDougal Street 8d21752v.jpg|thumb|right|An Italian-American espresso shop.]]
Some English dictionaries translate ''espresso'' as &quot;pressed-out&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the word also conveys the senses of ''expressly for you'' and ''quickly'':

{{quote|The words ''express'', ''expres'' and ''espresso'' each have several meanings in English, French and Italian. The first meaning is to do with the idea of &quot;expressing&quot; or squeezing the flavour from the coffee using the pressure of the steam. The second meaning is to do with speed, as in a train. Finally there is the notion of doing something &quot;expressly&quot; for a person&amp;nbsp;... The first Bezzera and Pavoni espresso machines in 1906 took 45 seconds to make a cup of coffee, one at a time, expressly for you.{{sfn|Bersten|1993|page=99}} }}

Modern espresso, using hot water under pressure, as pioneered by [[Gaggia]] in the 1940s, was originally called ''[[crema caffè]]'' (in English, &quot;cream coffee&quot;) as seen on old Gaggia machines, due to the crema.{{sfn|Morris|2007}} This term is no longer used, though ''crema caffè'' and variants (''caffè crema, café crema'') still appear in branding.

===Variant spelling===

The spelling ''expresso'' is mostly considered incorrect, though some sources call it a less common variant.&lt;ref name=diction&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/expresso|title=Expresso - Define Expresso at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy uses the term ''espresso'', substituting ''s'' for most ''x'' letters in Latin-root words; ''x'' is not considered part of the standard Italian alphabet. Italian people commonly refer to it simply as ''[[caffè]]'' (coffee), espresso being the ordinary coffee to order; in Spain, while ''café expreso'' is seen as the more &quot;formal&quot; denomination, ''café solo'' (alone, without milk) is the usual way to ask for it when at an [[espresso bar]].

Some sources state that ''expresso'' is an incorrect spelling, including ''Garner's Modern American Usage''.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/08/18/espresso_or_expresso_the_x_spelling_actually_has_considerable_historical.html|title=Espresso or expresso?

The main variables in a shot of espresso are the &quot;size&quot; and &quot;length&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hbbr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home-barista.com/tips/brewing-ratios-for-espresso-beverages-t2402.html|title=Brewing ratios for espresso beverages - Home-Barista.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gimmie&quot;&gt;[http://www.gimmecoffee.com/galleries/anatomy_of_a_triple_ristretto/ Anatomy of a Triple Ristretto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009163124/http://www.gimmecoffee.com/galleries/anatomy_of_a_triple_ristretto/ |date=9 October 2009 }}, by Jeremy Gauger, [[Gimme Coffee]], 17 March 2009 – images and explanation&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology is standardized, but the precise sizes and proportions vary substantially.

Cafés may have a standardized shot (size and length), such as &quot;triple ''ristretto''&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;gimmie&quot; /&gt; only varying the number of shots in espresso-based drinks such as lattes, but not changing the [[Espresso extraction|extraction]] – changing between a double and a triple requires changing the filter basket size, while changing between ''ristretto'', ''normale'', and ''lungo'' may require changing the grind, which is less easily accommodated in a busy café.

=== Size ===
The size can be a single, double, or triple, using a proportional amount of ground coffee, roughly 7, 14, and 21&amp;nbsp;grams; correspondingly sized filter baskets are used. The Italian [[multiplier (linguistics)|multiplier]] term ''doppio'' is often used for a double, with ''solo'' and ''triplo'' being more rarely used for singles and triples. The single shot is the traditional shot size, being the maximum that could easily be pulled on a lever machine.

Single baskets are sharply tapered or stepped down in diameter to provide comparable depth to the double baskets and, therefore, comparable resistance to water pressure. Most double baskets are gently tapered (the &quot;Faema model&quot;), while others, such as the La Marzocco, have straight sides. Triple baskets are normally straight-sided.

Portafilters will often come with two spouts, usually closely spaced, and a double-size basket – each spout can optionally dispense into a separate cup, yielding two solo-size (but doppio-brewed) shots, or into a single cup (hence the close spacing). True ''solo'' shots are rare, with a single shot in a café generally being half of a ''doppio'' shot.

In espresso-based drinks in America, particularly larger milk-based drinks, a drink with three or four shots of espresso will be called a &quot;triple&quot; or &quot;quad&quot;, respectively.

=== Length ===
The length of the shot can be ''ristretto'' (or ''stretto'') (reduced), ''normale'' or standard (normal), or ''lungo'' (long):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/07/travel/fare-of-the-country-in-italy-espresso-is-the-elixir-of-life.html|title=Fare of the Country: In Italy, Espresso is the Elixir of Life|last=Hofmann|first=Paul|date=7 August 1983|access-date=25 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; these may correspond to a smaller or larger drink with the same amount of ground coffee and same level of extraction or to different length of extraction. Proportions vary and the volume (and low density) of crema make volume-based comparisons difficult (precise measurement uses the mass of the drink). Typically ''ristretto'' is half the volume of ''normale'', and ''lungo'' is double to triple the ''normale'' volume.  For a double shot, (14 grams of dry coffee), a ''normale'' uses about 60 ml of water.  A ''double ristretto,'' a common form associated with espresso, uses half the amount of water, about 30 ml.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

''Ristretto, normale'', and ''lungo'' may not simply be the same shot, stopped at different times{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}—which may result in an under-extracted shot (if run too short a time) or an over-extracted shot (if run too long a time).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Rather, the grind is adjusted (finer for ''ristretto'', coarser for ''lungo'') so the target volume is achieved by the time extraction finishes.

A significantly longer shot is the ''[[caffè crema]]'', which is longer than a ''lungo'', ranging in size from {{convert|120|-|240|ml|impoz USoz|abbr=on}}, and brewed in the same way, with a coarser grind.

The method of adding hot water produces a milder version of original flavor, while passing more water through the load of ground coffee will add other flavors to the espresso, which might be unpleasant for some people.

==Variations==

=== Caffè Freddo ===

A ''Caffè Freddo'' or ''Espresso Freddo'' espresso is the cold version of an espresso, mostly served in [[southern Europe]]. In Rome, coffee bars have the drink already prepared and chilled. 

=== Freddo Espresso ===

In [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], and neighbouring countries, a cold espresso is a ''Freddo Espresso''. Despite its Italian name, the drink is prepared differently from its Italian counterpart. Conceived in [[Greece]], along with [[Cappuccino Freddo|freddo cappuccino]] in the early 1990s, freddo espresso is in higher demand during summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nespresso.com/gr/el/pages/freddo|title=Freddo Espresso &amp; Freddo Cappuccino {{!}} Nespresso Hellas|website=www.nespresso.com|access-date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2 shots of espresso (usually ristretto) are prepared, the coffee is stirred in a big metal can along with sugar (if desired) and 2–3 ice cubes until the coffee is cold. Then the blend is put in a glass with additional ice.

== Espresso-based drinks ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
[[File:Caffè Espresso Macchiato Schiumato.jpg|thumb|A traditional macchiato as served in Italy]]

In addition to being served alone, espresso is frequently blended, notably with milk – either steamed (without significant foam), wet foamed (&quot;[[microfoam]]&quot;), or dry foamed, and with hot water. Notable milk-based espresso drinks, in order of size, include: [[Caffè macchiato|macchiato]], [[cappuccino]], [[flat white]], and [[latte]]; other milk and espresso combinations include [[latte macchiato]], [[cortado]] and [[galão]], which are made primarily with steamed milk with little or no foam. Espresso and water combinations include [[Caffè Americano|Americano]] and [[long black]]. Other combinations include batch-brewed [[coffee with espresso]], sometimes called &quot;red eye&quot; or &quot;shot in the dark&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The art and craft of coffee: an enthusiast's guide to selecting, roasting, and brewing exquisite coffee|last=Kevin|first=Sinnott|year=2010|publisher=Quarry Books|isbn=9781592535637|location=Beverly, Mass.|page=160|oclc=437298903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order of size, these may be organized as follows:
* Traditional ''macchiato'': 35–40 ml, one shot (30 ml) with a small amount of milk (mostly steamed, with slight foam so there is a visible mark)
* Modern ''macchiato'': 60 ml or 120 ml, one or two shots (30 or 60 ml), with 1:1 milk
* ''Cortado'': 60 ml, one shot with 1:1 milk, little foam
* ''Piccolo Latte'': 90 ml, one shot with 1:2 milk, little foam
* ''Galão'': 120 ml, one shot with 1:3 milk, little foam
* Flat white: 150 ml, one or two shots (30 or 60 ml), with 1:4 or 2:3 milk, and a small amount (usually {{convert|1/4|in|mm|0|abbr=in|disp=or|order=flip}}) microfoam. 
* ''Cappuccino'': a very popular frothed milk and espresso drink with no generally-accepted volume standards, but usually served at 120 to 160 ml, including a single or (more commonly) double shot of espresso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/fashion/mens-style/is-that-cappuccino-youre-drinking-really-a-cappuccino.html |title=Is That Cappuccino You're Drinking Really a Cappuccino? |first=John |last=Ortved |date=29 September 2015 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Latte'': 240–600 ml, two or more shots (60 ml), with 1:3–1:9 milk

Some common combinations may be organized graphically as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot; |
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | mixed with
|-
! frothed milk !! hot water
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | espresso is on !! top
| ''latte macchiato'' || long black
|-
! bottom
| ''caffè latte'' || ''caffè americano''
|}

Methods of preparation differ between drinks and between baristas. For macchiatos, cappuccino, flat white, and smaller lattes and Americanos, the espresso is brewed into the cup, then the milk or water is poured in. For larger drinks, where a tall glass will not fit under the brew head, the espresso is brewed into a small cup, then poured into the larger cup; for this purpose a [[demitasse]] or specialized [[espresso brew pitcher]] may be used. This &quot;pouring into an existing glass&quot; is a defining characteristic of the latte macchiato and classic renditions of the red eye. Alternatively, a glass with &quot;existing&quot; water may have espresso brewed into it – to preserve the crema – in the long black. Brewing onto milk is not generally done.

'''Perkele''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈperkele|lang|Fi-perkele.ogg}}) means ''[[evil spirit]]'' or variation of words &quot;[[Damnation#As profanity|god damn]]&quot; in Finnish and is a popular [[Finnish profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kielitoimiston sanakirja|publisher=Kotimaisten kielten tutkimuskeskus |year=2006|ISBN=952-5446-20-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most likely the most internationally known Finnish curse word.&lt;ref&gt;[https://crosssection.gns.wisc.edu/2014/10/12/how-finns-swear-and-what-this-tells-us-about-their-culture-by-emily-malone/ How Finns Swear and What This Tells Us About Their Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.biginfinland.com/swearwords-finnish-list-profanities/ Finnish swearwords – a list of profanities you shouldn’t know]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in Swearing Research: New languages and new contexts|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |year=2017|ISBN=978-9027256874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Finnish|publisher=E-painos |year=2015|ASIN=B015AM7Q90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The name is of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin; [[Perkwunos]] is the reconstructed name of the god of thunder. Other gods from cultures hypothesized from the same origin include [[Perkūnas]] ([[Lithuania]]), [[Pērkons]] ([[Latvia]]), [[Percunis]] ([[Prussia]]), [[Perun|Piarun]] ([[Belarus]]), [[Peko]] or Pekolasõ ([[Estonia]]), [[Parjanya]] ([[India]]), [[Gothic paganism|Fairguneis]] ([[Goths|Gothic]]), and [[Perun]] or Piorun ([[Bosnia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech republic]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]]).{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Some researchers consider ''Perkele'' to be an original name of the thunder god [[Ukko]], the chief god of the [[Finnish paganism|Finnish pagan]] pantheon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Siikala|first=Anna-Leena|title=Itämerensuomalaisten mytologia|publisher=SKS|year=2013|location=Helsinki}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this view is not shared by all researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salo|first=Unto|title=Agricola's Ukko in the light of archeology.

==Use==
It has a history of being used as a curse:  a cry for the god for strength. It still is a common curse word in vernacular Finnish. To a Finn, the word entails seriousness and potency that more lightly used curses lack. Also, when the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland held a popular contest to nominate the &quot;most energizing&quot; word in the Finnish language, one of the suggestions was Perkele because &quot;it is the curse word that gave the most strength for the reconstruction of Finland after the wars.&quot;

==Introduction of Christianity==
As Finland was [[Christianization|Christianized]], the [[Catholic Church]] started to demonise the old Finnish deities. This led to the use of &quot;''Perkele''&quot; as a translation for &quot;Devil&quot; in the Finnish translation of the Bible. Later, in a 1992 translation, the word was rendered as ''paholainen'' (the evil one).{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Uses in popular culture==

* Many Finnish bands like [[Impaled Nazarene]], [[Norther]] and [[Pepe Deluxe]] use the word ''perkele'' for emphasis and to reference Finnishness, while another Finnish metal band, [[Amorphis]], have a song titled &quot;Perkele (The God of Fire)&quot;, the sixth track on their album ''[[Eclipse (Amorphis album)|Eclipse]]''.
* The Swedish [[Oi!]] band Perkele were formed in 1993 in [[Gothenburg]] and are currently signed to [[Oi! the Boat Records]].
* In the webcomic ''[http://satwcomic.com/ Scandinavia and the World]'', Finland is depicted as a sullen, violent drunk who is largely mute, save for uttering the word &quot;perkele&quot; when things do not go his way.
*In 2019's [[Control (video game)|Control]], Ahti, a Finnish janitor who is also hinted to be an enormously powerful supernatural entity, uses ''perkele'' as a crutch word when describing the weird events taking place in the Federal Bureau of Control.

If the [[inessive case|inessive]] were used, ''kodissani'', it would distinguish the activity from reading the papers, such as in the garage or in the garden (of the home).
* ''{{lang|fi|Minulla on kylpyhuone kodissani.}}'' &quot;I have a bathroom in my home&quot; (not in the garage or garden).

When marking something that cannot literally change states, the essive case can implicate the presence of alternative states, even two individual, differing &quot;worlds&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salminen&quot;&gt;Salminen, Taru. &quot;Retention of abstract meaning: The essive case and grammaticalization of polyphony in Finnish.&quot; New Reflections on Grammaticalization. Philadelphia, PA: John Benjamins Publishing Co., 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; That can be seen in the following example:

:Example: ''{{lang|fi|Ostin helmen aitona.}}'' &quot;I bought the pearl thinking it was genuine [but later found out that it was not].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salminen&quot;/&gt;

The example above illustrates the process by which marking of the essive case can be seen as creating two differing &quot;worlds&quot;: one real and one illusionary. The &quot;temporary&quot; component of the meaning encoded by marking of the essive case on the Finnish word for &quot;genuine&quot; (aito) makes a distinction between the perceived state of the subject, as genuine at the time of purchase, and the actual state of subject, as not genuine as it is now perceived or at the time of the moment of speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salminen&quot;/&gt;

==Estonian==
In [[Estonian language|Estonian]], it is marked by adding &quot;-na&quot; to the genitive stem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;&gt;Moseley, Christopher. Colloquial Estonian: The Complete Course for Beginners. New York, NY: Routledge, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Marking of the case in Estonian denotes the capacity in which the subject acts. The essive case is used for indicating &quot;states of being&quot; but not of &quot;becoming&quot;, which is instead marked by the translative case, the elative case, or the nominative case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;/&gt;
:Examples:
:''{{lang|et|laps}}'' &quot;child&quot; → ''{{lang|et|lapse}}'' &quot;of child&quot; → ''{{lang|et|lapsena}}'' &quot;as a child&quot;, &quot;when (I) was a child&quot;.
   
:''{{lang|et|Ta töötab insenerina}} &quot;He works as an engineer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;/&gt;

Year '''237''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCXXXVII]]''') was a [[common year starting on Sunday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Perpetuus and Felix''' (or, less frequently, '''year 990 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 237 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

      <text bytes="2803" xml:space="preserve">In [[grammar]], the '''translative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''transl'''}}) is a [[grammatical case]] that indicates a change in state of a noun, with the general sense of &quot;becoming ''X''{{space|hair}}&quot; or &quot;change to ''X''{{space|hair}}&quot;.

In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], it is the counterpart of the [[essive case]], with the basic meaning of a change of state. It is also used for expressing &quot;in (a language)&quot;, &quot;considering it is a (status)&quot; and &quot;by (a time)&quot;. Its ending is ''-ksi'':
* ''pitkä'' &quot;long&quot;, ''venyi pitkäksi'' &quot;(it) stretched long&quot;
* ''englanti'' &quot;English&quot;, ''En osaa sanoa tätä englanniksi'' &quot;I can't say this in English&quot;
* ''pentu'' &quot;cub&quot;, ''Se on pennuksi iso'' &quot;For a cub, it is big&quot;
* ''musta aukko'' &quot;black hole&quot;, ''(muuttui) mustaksi aukoksi'' &quot;(turned into) a black hole&quot;
* ''kello kuusi'' &quot;(at) six o' clock&quot;, ''kello kuudeksi'' &quot;by six o' clock&quot;

Examples in [[Estonian language|Estonian]], where the ending is ''-ks'':
* ''pikk'' &quot;long&quot;, ''venis pikaks'' &quot;(it) stretched long&quot;
* ''must auk'' &quot;black hole&quot;, ''(muutus/muundus) mustaks auguks'' &quot;(turned into) a black hole&quot;
* ''kell kuus'' &quot;(at) six o' clock&quot;, ''kella kuueks'' &quot;by six o' clock&quot;
In Estonian, translative can also express a temporary or random state. E.g. while a nominative construction would indicate working in a job or profession, as ''olen koolis õpetaja'' &quot;I'm a teacher in a school&quot;, a similar sentence using translative ''olen koolis õpetajaks'' &quot;I work as a teacher in a school&quot; hints at it either being a temporary position, the speaker not being fully qualified, or some other factor of impermanency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eki.ee/books/ekk09/index.php?p=3&amp;p1=4&amp;id=166 Saav kääne] (Translative case), Eesti keele käsiraamat (The Handbook of Estonian Language), Eesti Keele Instituut, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the ending is -vá / -vé after a vowel; it assimilates to the final consonant otherwise:

* ''só'' &quot;salt&quot;, ''Lót felesége sóvá változott'' &quot;Lot's wife turned into salt&quot;
* ''fiú'' &quot;boy; son&quot;  ''fiává fogad'' &quot;adopt as one's son&quot;
* ''bolond'' &quot;fool&quot;  ''bolonddá tett engem'' &quot;He made a fool out of me.&quot;

{{Wiktionary|instructive}}
In [[grammar]], the '''instructive case''' is a [[grammatical case]] used in the [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], and [[Turkish language]]s.

== Finnish ==
In the [[Finnish language]], the '''instructive case''' has the basic meaning of &quot;by means of&quot;. It is a comparatively rarely used case, though it is found in some commonly used expressions, such as ''omin silmin'' → &quot;with one's own eyes&quot;.

In modern Finnish, many of its [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] uses are being superseded by the [[adessive case]], as in &quot;minä matkustin junalla&quot; → &quot;I travelled ''by train''.&quot;

It is also used with Finnish verbal second [[infinitive]]s to mean &quot;by ...ing&quot;, e.g. &quot;lentäen&quot; → &quot;by flying&quot;, &quot;by air&quot; (&quot;lentää&quot; = &quot;to fly&quot;).

== Estonian ==
In Estonian, the instructive case (Estonian: viisiütlev) also exists, but only in some words. (f.e: &quot;jalgsi&quot; - &quot;on foot&quot;, from &quot;jalg&quot; - foot)

== Turkish ==
In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the suffix ''-le'' is used for this purpose. Ex: Trenle geldim &quot;I came via train&quot;.

In [[linguistics]], '''abessive''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''abe'''}} or {{sc|'''abess'''}}), '''caritive''' and '''privative''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''priv'''}}) is the [[grammatical case]] expressing the lack or absence of the marked noun. In [[English language|English]], the corresponding function is expressed by the [[preposition]] ''[[wikt:without|without]]'' or by the [[Affix|suffix]] ''[[wikt:-less|-less]].''

The name ''abessive'' is derived from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''abesse'' &quot;to be away/absent&quot;, and is especially used in reference to [[Uralic languages]]. The name ''caritive'' is derived from Latin ''carere'' &quot;to lack&quot;, and is especially used in reference to [[Caucasian languages]]. The name ''privative'' is derived from Latin ''privare'' &quot;to deprive&quot;.

==In Afro-Asiatic languages==

===Somali===
In the [[Somali language]], the abessive case is marked by ''-laa'' or ''-la'' and dropping all but the first [[syllable]] on certain words. For example:
:''jeceylaa'' &quot;love&quot;
:''jeelaa'' &quot;loveless&quot;
:''dar'' &quot;clothes&quot;
:''dharla'aan'' &quot;clothesless,&quot; i.e., [[naked]]

==In Australian languages==

===Martuthunira===
In [[Martuthunira language|Martuthunira]], the privative case is formed with two suffixes, ''-wirriwa'' and ''-wirraa''. What determines which suffix is used in a given situation is unclear.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| ''Parla-wirraa'' || ''nganarna.''
|-
| money-&lt;small&gt;'''PRIV'''&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;[[clusivity|1PL.EX]]&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;| We've got no money.
|}

==In Uralic languages==

===Finnish===
In the [[Finnish language]], the abessive case is marked by ''-tta'' for back vowels and ''-ttä'' for front vowels according to [[vowel harmony]]. For example:
:''raha'' &quot;money&quot;
:''rahatta'' &quot;without money&quot;
An equivalent construction exists using the word ''ilman'' and the [[partitive]]:
:''ilman rahaa'' &quot;without money&quot;
or, less commonly:
:''rahaa ilman'' &quot;without money&quot;
The abessive case of [[nouns]] is rarely used in writing and even less in speech, although some abessive forms are more common than their equivalent ''ilman'' forms:
:''tuloksetta'' &quot;unsuccessfully, fruitlessly&quot;
:''Itkin syyttä.'' &quot;I cried for no reason.&quot;
The abessive is, however, commonly used in [[Verbal noun|nominal forms of verbs]] (formed with the affix ''-ma-'' / ''-mä-''), such as ''puhu-ma-tta'' &quot;without speaking&quot;, ''osta-ma-tta'' &quot;without buying,&quot; ''välittä-mä-ttä'' &quot;without caring:&quot;
:''Juna jäi tulematta.'' &quot;The train didn't show up.&quot;
This form can often be replaced by using the negative form of the verb:
:''Juna ei tullut.''

It is possible to occasionally hear what is considered wrong usage of the abessive in Finnish, where the abessive and ''ilman'' forms are combined:
:''ilman rahatta''
There is debate as to whether this is interference from [[Estonian language|Estonian]].

===Estonian===

[[Estonian language|Estonian]] also uses the abessive, which is marked by ''-ta'' in both the singular and the plural:
:''(ilma) autota'' &quot;without a car&quot; (the preposition ''ilma'' &quot;without&quot; is optional)
Unlike in Finnish, the abessive is commonly used in both written and spoken Estonian.

The [[Verbal noun|nominal forms of verbs]] are marked with the affix ''-ma-'' and the abessive marker ''-ta'':
:''Rong jäi tulemata.'' &quot;The train didn't show up.&quot;

[[Tallinn]] has a pair of [[bar (establishment)|bars]] that play on the use of the [[comitative]] and [[abessive]], the Nimeta baar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimetabaar.ee/English.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707113952/http://www.nimetabaar.ee/English.html |archivedate=2006-07-07 }} Nimeta baar, English page&lt;/ref&gt; (the nameless bar) and the Nimega baar&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baarid.ee/en/NimegaBar/programm.php Nimega baar  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313133736/http://www.baarid.ee/en/NimegaBar/programm.php |date=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the bar with a name).

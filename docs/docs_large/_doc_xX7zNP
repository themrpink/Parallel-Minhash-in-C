Tapiola was largely constructed in the 1950s and 1960s by the Finnish housing foundation and was designed as a [[Garden city movement|garden city]].&lt;ref name=Tuomi/&gt; It is the location of the [[Espoo cultural centre]], the [[Espoo Museum of Modern Art]] (EMMA), the Espoo city museum, and the Espoo City Theatre.

According to the [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]], Tapiola was the largest and most valuable example of the 1960s construction ideologies in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rky.fi/read/asp/r_kohde_det.aspx?KOHDE_ID=1359 Valuable construction areas in Finland] [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]] {{in lang|fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its architecture and landscaping that combines urban living with nature has attracted tourists ever since.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[File:Tapiola paviljonki 280619.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The original Tapiola logo.]]
Tapiola was one of the first post-war &quot;new town&quot; projects in Continental Europe. It was created by a private non-profit enterprise called Asuntosäätiö (the Housing Foundation), which was established in 1951 by six social trade organisations including the Confederation of Finnish Trade Unions, the Central Organisation of Tenants, the Mannerheim Child Welfare Federation, the Finnish Federation of Civilian and Military Invalids and the Civil Servants' Federation.&lt;ref name=Tuomi/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;&gt;Tuomi, T., &amp; Paatero, K.

The new town movement in Europe. ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 451'', 76-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was conceived, built and managed by [[Heikki von Hertzen]], the executive of the Asuntosäätiö and garden city advocate.&lt;ref name=&quot;merlin&quot;/&gt; Under Von Hertzen's leadership, the Housing Foundation bought 660 acres of forest land, six miles from the centre of Helsinki, and set out to create an ideal garden city.&lt;ref name=&quot;heideman&quot;&gt;Heideman Jr 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the Housing Foundation included financing the project and overseeing the planning and building process so as to ensure consistency within different areas of the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;armen&quot;&gt;Armen, G.

''Planning Perspectives, 23'', 147-169.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Hertzen set out to create a modern urban environment that would address the housing shortage in Helsinki and would be both economically viable and beautiful.&lt;ref name=&quot;merlin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;&gt;Tuomi, T. (1992). ''Tapiola: A history and architectural guide''. Espoo: Espoo City Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Tapiola did not form part of any wider plan for Finland’s development other than von Hertzen’s Seven Towns Plan, a response to urban sprawl in Helsinki.&lt;ref name=&quot;armen&quot; /&gt;

The original city plans for Tapiola were made by [[Otto-Iivari Meurman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;&gt;Hertzen, H.V., &amp; Spreiregen, P.D. (1971). ''Building a new town: Finland’s new garden city: Tapiola''. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Housing Foundation made significant changes to the plans, and handed planning of Tapiola over to a group of prominent Finnish architects, including [[Aarne Ervi]], [[Alvar Aalto]], and [[Kaija Siren]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen&quot;&gt;Hertzen 1959&lt;/ref&gt; Each member of the group designed their own part of the area and its buildings, including social housing blocks (80% of all dwellings) and individual houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt;

The planners of Tapiola were convinced that no one professional group could solve the manifold problems of modern community planning; planning has to be highly skilled and strictly directed teamwork at all levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;/&gt; Tapiola is a result of close teamwork in the fields of architecture, sociology, civil engineering, landscape gardening, domestic science, and youth welfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;/&gt;

The name of the garden city itself was chosen through a public competition in 1953. The winning name was suggested by eleven different people, which in Finnish means the home of the Tapio, the forest god from The Kalevala.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt;

Tapiola is also the cultural centre of Espoo, as it houses the [[Espoo cultural centre]] (home of the [[Tapiola Sinfonietta]]), the city museum (in the [[WeeGee house]]), and the Espoo City Theatre. The Tapiola [[library]] is located in the cultural centre.

==Urban planning==
Tapiola brought worldwide fame for Finnish urban planning. From its first stages it gained both a national and international reputation for its high class architecture and landscaping, as well as an ideological experiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;/&gt; Tapiola's planners aimed at demonstrating a new direction for Finnish town planning and housing. The aim of the Housing Foundation was to create a garden city which would be a microcosm of Finnish society: all social classes would live there and there would be different types of buildings, ranging from detached houses to terraced and multi-storey blocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt; The slogan of the project was: &quot;we do not want to build houses or dwellings but socially healthful surroundings for contemporary man and his family&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt; Tapiola provided a utopian vision of society and an alternative to what was seen at the time as an oppressive urban environment. In this sense, Tapiola was both an experiment and a model.

Tapiola was built on the principles of [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s garden city. The founder of Tapiola, Heikki von Hertzen, believed that it was not possible to create a satisfactory residential centre if the population density exceeds a certain figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen&quot;/&gt; Hertzen's vision for Tapiola, which was originally planned for an area of 600 acres, was to have only 26 residents per acre, and a total of 15,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen&quot;/&gt; The ground was divided into four neighbourhood units, separated by green belts, and in the middle was built a main shopping and cultural centre to meet the needs of 30,000 inhabitants (including those of surrounding districts) (Hertzen 1959). An important feature of the Tapiola and garden cities is the development of a self-contained community. This meant that as many jobs as possible had to be provided – as many as could be at a distance of less than 10&amp;nbsp;km from Helsinki.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt;

The architects commissioned to plan Tapiola had also been influenced by [[Le Corbusier]]&lt;ref name=Tuomi/&gt; and other propagandists of Modernism, and thus their urban ideals also included tower blocks forming impressive silhouettes, as well as a dense method of building.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt; The various residential units which made up Tapiola comprise multi-storey blocks and individual homes, either detached or in rows, introducing a note of variety in the neighbourhood and allowing for the mixing of residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen&quot;/&gt; Combining the architecture of modernism and the ideology of the garden city movement is credited for the huge interest in Tapiola's planning history.

The main planning features on which Tapiola was built, as synthesised from Von Hertzen's writings, are summarised below:
*The starting point of planning is the individuality of man and closeness to nature, and the aesthetic value of nature and use of natural contours of the landscape are retained wherever possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt;
*Nature dominates, architecture is secondary. All buildings must harmonise with the natural setting.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen&quot;/&gt;
*To be a working town, not a dormitory or nursery, providing as many jobs as possible to its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen&quot;/&gt;
*The town should provide for a range of income levels – &quot;a community of everyman, where the ordinary worker, successful businessman and university professor can live side-by-side&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt;
*Consistent placing of multi-story buildings with alternatively low housing, resulting in a feeling of spaciousness and variety.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen&quot;/&gt;

===Neighbourhoods===
[[File:TapiolaMantytorniH.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mäntytorni apartment building, designed by [[Aarne Ervi]]]]
[[File:Tapiolan keskusta aamu 280619.png|thumb|right|250px|The park east of the center of Tapiola.]]
The development of Tapiola occurred in several stages: the eastern neighbourhood 1952 – 1956, the western neighbourhood, 1957-1960, the town centre 1958-1961-1970, the northern neighbourhood 1958-1967, the southern neighbourhood 1961-1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;armen&quot;/&gt; Planning in Tapiola commenced with architect, Otto-Iivari Meurman's site plan and building schedule which were reviewed from 1951 onwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;/&gt; His original plan detailed four neighbourhoods split by two crossing roads and set apart by green belts.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt;

Architects Aarne Ervi, Viljo Revell, Aulis Blomstedt and Markus Tavio were charged with designing the eastern neighbourhood based on Meurman's plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;/&gt; They were required to design buildings suited to the surrounding environment and the topography of the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt;

A housing team was created to appraise the architects' housing designs; this process occurred more frequently during the development of the eastern neighbourhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt; Team members were from a wide range of fields and included a building engineer, a heating engineer, two independent architects, an electrical engineer, a landscape gardener, a domestic science expert, a child welfare expert, a sociologist, and a housewife.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt; This unique team, coupled with the board of the Housing Foundation, assessed housing designs, taking into consideration the needs and desires of future residents from a diverse range of backgrounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt; The parties had different beliefs and values, which sometimes led to disagreements, for example the Housing Foundation was concerned with economising whilst the home-economics experts were chiefly concerned with the needs of families.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;/&gt; Thus planning in Tapiola was collaborative and proactive as it involved targeting specific family types and classes, deciding on an ideal lifestyle for these residents, which accordingly influenced their behaviours.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;/&gt; Many dwellings were designed to house a specific family-type and lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;/&gt; For example, it was perceived to be ideal to have families with children reside in dwellings, at or close to ground level in order for the children to have better access to the outdoors and to parks, whilst a tower block with one-room flats was designed to accommodate childless couples.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;/&gt;

Meurman resigned from the board of governors of the Housing Foundation in 1954 following a shift from developing a town with low population density (six persons per acre) and low-rise buildings dwellings, as advocated by Meurman, to more multi-storey buildings and a higher population density (30 persons per acre) as recommended by other architects and the Housing Foundation.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt; This shift was prompted by the need to accommodate a larger population, triggered by the housing shortage in Finland.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;/&gt; Ervi took up Meurman’s position as master planner.&lt;ref name=&quot;lahti&quot;/&gt;

The development of the eastern neighbourhood led to the implementation of important planning principles such as providing facilities that encourage interaction and foster a sense of community as well as the separation of vehicles and pedestrians.&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzen_spreiregen&quot;/&gt; It was also deemed necessary to have a mixture of building types located within the one area to encourage social diversification.&lt;ref name=&quot;armen&quot;/&gt; The eastern and western residential areas of Tapiola featured curved streets of varying sizes and positions, whilst the northern neighbourhood designed by architect Pentti Ahola, marked a return to the orthogonal grid plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;/&gt; Ahola's design however, reflected the original aims of Tapiola; that of encouraging social diversification by locating a variety of building types within the one area.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;/&gt; Financial concerns affected the development of the western area of Tapiola, leading to the construction of housing units that were economically feasible.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;/&gt;

In 1953 Aarne Ervi was awarded the commission to plan the town centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;lahti&quot;/&gt; The aim of the town centre's design was to provide all the facilities necessary for a modern urban centre and to maximise social interaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi_paatero&quot;/&gt; The centre included a market square, public square, church, public premises, businesses and an administration building.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;/&gt; As with the other areas of Tapiola, the centre was designed with consideration for the site's features and terrain as well as to provide an active and versatile environment for pedestrians.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;/&gt; Roads surrounded the central area producing a modern design completely separate from vehicles and featuring a special route for pedestrians and cyclists only (Tapionraitti).&lt;ref name=&quot;lahti&quot;/&gt; Ervi ensured the centre preserved the garden-city character of Tapiola by locating the buildings around an artificial lake, however this plan was considered strange and criticised for its lack of density.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;/&gt; The centre was later expanded with a pedestrian based shopping centre linked to the Tapionraitti, notable for its undercover, outdoor pathways.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;/&gt; Later developments showed less consideration for the natural surroundings, though most developments respected the dominance of the existing buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;/&gt; Tapiola's centre did not expand to such an extent as to rival Helsinki.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuomi&quot;/&gt;

== Espoo ==
{{POV section|date=November 2013}}

The building of Tapiola and other areas of Espoo was largely influenced by funding from the state.&lt;ref name=Tuomi/&gt; Without state funds, the construction would not have been possible; however the state imposed restrictions on average and maximum size of the apartments and so on.&lt;ref name=Tuomi/&gt;

In the 1980s, the state of Finland demanded that this all be given, free of charge, to the city of Espoo against the residents' opinions. Espoo decided that the center of Tapiola and the area with the main offices of the [[Metsä Group]], [[Finnforest (company)|Finnforest]], Vapo, the main user of the [[peat energy in Finland]], [[Metsä Board]] (formerly Metsä Botnia), the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK) and Tapiola Constructing and Insurance company here, the [[Tapiola Bank]] company, is not the real Tapiola and may be constructed neglecting all garden city principles. This applied also to the Tapiola Garden hotel constructed by the Tapiola Bank and managed by [[HOK Elanto]].

Originally, nature was a valuable part of Tapiola. During the last years new high-rise buildings, new shopping areas and underground car parks were situated in the place of massive bedrock. Car parking free of charge has been promised for everybody in the center to promote the private use of cars. The cost is estimated as €30,000-€50,000 per car. The [[International Association of Public Transport]] recommends ensuring the management of all costs of private cars to the users instead of tax payers. According to the [[International Association of Public Transport]] the restriction of car parking in the cities is the most effective way to promote [[public transport]].

==Services==
[[File:Tapiolan keskustaa illalla.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Tapiola commercial centre at Christmas time]]
Finland's first [[shopping centre]], [[Heikintori]], was opened in Tapiola in 1968. The Tapiola centre has a large selection of services: a [[department store]] ([[Stockmann]]), a book store ([[Akateeminen kirjakauppa]]), [[grocery|groceries]] ([[K-Supermarket]], [[Stockmann Herkku]]), [[Alko]], a [[post office]], [[bank]]s ([[Nordea]], [[Danske Bank]], [[Aktia Savings Bank|Aktia]], [[Osuuspankki]], [[Ålandsbanken]], [[Handelsbanken]] and [[Nooa Säästöpankki]]), [[photography]] stores, barber's shops, and other small businesses. Public services include the Tapiola health centre, a library, an employment bureau, and the Espoo tax bureau.

===Public transportation===
[[Public transport]] in Tapiola consists of buses and the metro maintained by the [[Helsinki Regional Transport Authority]]. The [[Tapiola metro station]], a station of the [[Helsinki Metro]], opened as a part of [[Länsimetro]] (the Western Metro Extension) in November 2017.

===Sports services===
The Tapiola centre houses a [[Tapiola swimming pool|swimming pool]] and the Tapiola [[bowling alley]]. Near the centre is also the Tapiola [[tennis]] park. In the Tuulimäki defense shelter there are premises for [[wrestling]], [[judo]], shooting (air guns and archery), [[table tennis]], [[gymnastics]] and [[fencing]]. There is also a [[boxing ring]] in connection to the Tuulimäki gymnasium. In western Tapiola there is the [[Tapiolan Urheilupuisto|Tapiola sports park]], housing the [[ice hockey rink]], [[ice rink|skating rink]] and the tennis centre. The name Tapiola comes from a competition held by the apartment foundation. The lands originally belonged to the Hagalund mansion.

==Buildings==
[[File:Taskumattitaloja Tapiolassa.jpg|thumb|200px|right|So-called &quot;[[hip flask]] houses&quot;, designed by [[Viljo Revell]]]]
In the centre of Tapiola, next to the central pool, there is the Tapiola Garden [[hotel]], designed by Aarne Ervi. In autumn 2005, the highest [[wood]]en office building in [[Europe]], called the Modular-office, was built in southern Tapiola by next to the [[Länsiväylä]] highway. The building is operated by Finnforest.

[[File:Mini-Tapiola.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tapiola centre has a playground that features miniature versions of some of the iconic buildings in Tapiola.]]
Tapiola is also the name of a Finnish [[insurance]] company, presumably from the location of its headquarters. Among other major companies headquartered in Tapiola are [[Huhtamäki]] and [[M-real]].

In Otsolahti in eastern Tapiola, there is a small [[Marina|boat harbour]] for motor boats.

[[File:Kino Tapiola Espoo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kino Tapiola movie theater by [[Aarne Ervi]]]]
The Itäkartano area east of the Tapiola centre is famous for its [[apartment building]]s built in the 1950s, visited by architects from all around the world. The Itäkartano centre operated as the centre of the whole district of Tapiola before the current central area was built. Remnants of this central role include Tapiola's [[Movie theater|cinema]], Kino Tapiola, by the Mäntyviita street, and office apartments. The area belongs to the Finnish museum bureau's list of significant cultural environments. The highest, oldest, and most significant building in the area is the white, 11-storey [[Mäntytorni]] building.

To the north of Tapiola centre is a central park, [[Silkkiniitty]], a large grass field reaching to [[Pohjois-Tapiola]]. It is popular among sportspeople and sunbathers.

According to the Finnish museum bureau, Tapiola is a unique phenomenon in the world. According to the bureau, new proposed changes to the city planning threaten the existence of this cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kansallismaisema uhattuna&quot;, Vartti, 9 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.fi/tapiola Lukkarinen, Päivi: &quot;Tapiolan puutarhakaupunki&quot;, Finnish museum of building art.] (Last retrieved on 29 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[WeeGee house]], designed by architect [[Aarno Ruusuvuori]] and completed in 1964, is the former printing house of the Weilin+Göös publishing house. It currently hosts the [[Espoo Museum of Modern Art]] (EMMA), the Espoo City Museum, the Helinä Rautavaara Museum, the Finnish Museum of Horology, the Finnish Toy Museum, Galleria AARNI, and other cultural institutions.

Tapiola has its own metro station, the [[Tapiola metro station]]. The station was opened in November 2017.

== Controversies ==
The founder of the Garden City Tapiola, Heikki von Hertzen, considered suing the insurance company Tapiola in 1981 for stealing the trade name of Tapiola. The Garden City had used substantial resources in advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;Kenen vasikalla kynnetään? Tapiolassa syttyi nimisota Apu 7.1.1981 no 4, Herzen: Se on harhaanjohtavaa, Se on epäkorrektia&lt;/ref&gt; Herzen was afraid the insurance company might shorten its name by dropping the word, &quot;insurance&quot;, and this became also a fact for years in all advertisements in the buildings and newspapers.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The '''Karlovy Vary International Film Festival''' ({{lang-cs|Mezinárodní filmový festival Karlovy Vary}}) is a [[film festival]] held annually in July in [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Czech Republic]]. The Karlovy Vary Festival is one of the oldest in the [[world]] and has become [[Central and Eastern Europe|Central and Eastern Europe's]] leading film event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Festival2015&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Gere to Receive Crystal Globe at Karlovy Vary Film Festival|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/richard-gere-to-receive-crystal-globe-at-karlovy-vary-film-festival-1201524955/|publisher=Variety Media|date=22 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410214636/http://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/richard-gere-to-receive-crystal-globe-at-karlovy-vary-film-festival-1201524955/|archivedate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Atmosfery-2015.jpg|thumb|The opening of the 50th festival in front of the Hotel Thermal]]
The pre-war dream of many enthusiastic filmmakers materialized in 1946 when a non-competition festival of films from seven countries took place in [[Mariánské Lázně]] and [[Karlovy Vary]]. Above all it was intended to screen the results of the recently nationalized [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[film industry]]. After the first two years the festival moved permanently to Karlovy Vary.

The Karlovy Vary IFF first held an international film competition in 1948. Since 1951, an international jury has evaluated the films. The Karlovy Vary competition quickly found a place among other developing festivals and by 1956 [[FIAPF]] had already classified Karlovy Vary as a category A festival. Given the creation of the Moscow Film Festival and the political decision to organize only one &quot;A&quot; festival for all [[Communist state|socialist countries]], Karlovy Vary was forced to alternate year by year with [[Moscow International Film Festival|Moscow IFF]] between 1959 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/article.php?id=271&amp;festivals|title=Kinema : : A Journal for Film and Audiovisual Media|website=www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304232254/http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/article.php?id=271&amp;festivals|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social and political changes that took place after the [[Velvet Revolution]] in November 1989 pushed concerns about organizing the Karlovy Vary IFF to the background. The program for 1990 was saved by the release of a collection of Czechoslovak films which had been locked up for years in a storage vault. And the appearance of a number of international guests such as [[Miloš Forman]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[Annette Bening]] and [[Robert De Niro]] helped as well. Future festivals were in doubt. Financial problems and a lack of interest on the part of the government, organizers and viewers almost ended the festival's long tradition in 1992.

In 1994, the 29th Karlovy Vary IFF inaugurated an entirely new tradition. After nearly forty years of alternating with the [[Moscow International Film Festival|Moscow IFF]], the festival began once again to take place every year. The Karlovy Vary Film Festival Foundation was set up in 1993 co-created by the Ministry of Culture, The City of Karlovy Vary, and the [[Grand Hotel Pupp]]. Actor [[Jiří Bartoška]] was invited to be the festival's president, and Eva Zaoralová became program director in 1995. Since 1998, the organization of the festival has been carried out by Film Servis Festival Karlovy Vary, a [[joint stock company]].

The 2020 edition was cancelled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; a shortened event was later scheduled for 18-21 November, which will not be counted as an official edition of the festival (being promoted as the 54th and-a-half edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Grater|first=Tom|date=2020-07-03|title=Karlovy Vary Sets Special Event In November After Summer Fest Cancellation|url=https://deadline.com/2020/07/karlovy-vary-special-event-november-summer-fest-cancellation-1202976957/|access-date=2020-07-04|website=Deadline|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program==
[[File:Herec-herec-richard-gere-na-slavnostnim-zahajeni-50mff-kv.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Gere]] with the [[Crystal Globe]] at the 50th Karlovy Vary IFF (2015)]]
The main center of the festival is [[Hotel Thermal]]. The core of the program is the [[feature film]] competition; in accordance with [[FIAPF]] regulations only those films which have not been shown in competition at any other international festivals can be included. The documentary competition is an important festival event. The extensive informative program features both distribution pre-premiers and films awarded at [[List of film festivals|other festivals]]. But it also includes discoveries of artistic creations by independent directors, productions coming out of little known film industries, retrospectives, and an overview of [[Cinema of the Czech Republic|Czech film]] output during the past year. For the tenth straight year the festival will present Variety Critics' Choice: new and interesting films of mainly European production selected by critics working at this prestigious magazine.

Seminars focusing primarily on [[European cinema|European film]] are another important part of the festival.

Thousands of visitors and the great variety of films testify to the effectiveness of the program team with program director Eva Zaoralová at its head.

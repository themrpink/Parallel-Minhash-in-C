Much of [[H. G. Wells]]' 1898 novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' is set in Surrey with many specific towns and villages identified. The Martians first land on [[Horsell Common SSSI|Horsell Common]] on the north side of [[Woking]], outside the Bleak House pub, now called Sands. The narrator flees in the direction of London, first passing [[Byfleet]] and then [[Weybridge]] before travelling east along the north bank of the [[Thames]].

Jane Austen's novel [[Emma (novel)|''Emma'']] is set in the fictional town of Highbury, Surrey, and the picnic at which Emma Woodhouse embarrasses Miss Bates takes place on [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]]. Austen's unfinished novel ''[[The Watsons]]'' is also set in Surrey, and Emma Watson's brothers Robert and Samuel live in [[Croydon]] and [[Guildford]], respectively, while Emma has recently returned home to the fictional village of Stanton.

The character [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] from ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' claimed to be from Guildford in Surrey, but in actuality he was from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of [[Betelgeuse]].

Thomas Paine Kydd, the hero of the [[Kydd (novel)|''Kydd'']] series of [[naval adventure novel]]s written by [[Julian Stockwin]], starts off as a young wig-maker from Guildford who is pressed into service and thus begins a life at sea.

The late [[Poet Laureate]] [[Sir John Betjeman]] mentions [[Camberley]] in his poem &quot;A Subaltern's Lovesong&quot;, while [[Carshalton]] forms the literary backdrop to many of the poems by [[James Farrar]].

In [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter (series)|''Harry Potter'']] series, [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]] spends his childhood in the fictional town of Little Whinging, Surrey, under the guardianship of his pernicious relatives, [[the Dursleys]]. He leaves their house permanently four days before his seventeenth birthday, and that night there is an aerial battle in the skies over Surrey between the Order of the Phoenix and the Death Eaters.

The county has also been used as a film location. Part of the movie ''[[The Holiday]]'' was filmed in Godalming and Shere: [[Kate Winslet]]'s character Iris lived in a cottage in Shere and [[Cameron Diaz]]'s character Amanda switched houses with her as part of a home exchange. The final scene of ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]'' uses the village church, also in Shere, as does the movie ''[[The Wedding Date]]''. In the 1976 film [[The Omen (1976 film)|''The Omen'']], the scenes at the cathedral were filmed at [[Guildford Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;omen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1789988,00.html |title=Church fears return of Omen curse |access-date=31 August 2007 |date=4 June 2004 |work=The Observer |location=London |first=Rob |last=Sharp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821101558/https://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0%2C%2C1789988%2C00.html |archive-date=21 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film [[I Want Candy (film)|''I Want Candy'']] follows two hopeful lads from [[Leatherhead]] trying to break into the movies, and was partly filmed in Brooklands College ([[Weybridge]] campus).

A '''commodity market''' is a [[Market (economics)|market]] that trades in the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary economic sector]] rather than manufactured products, such as [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], fruit and [[sugar]]. Hard commodities are mined, such as [[gold]] and [[Crude oil|oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/softcommodity.asp#axzz2EGf9ZeC2 |title=Soft Commodity Definition |publisher=Investopedia |date=15 February 2009 |access-date=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Futures contract]]s are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost21apr2010 /&gt; Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using [[spot price]]s, [[Forward contract|forwards]], [[futures contract|futures]], and [[option (finance)|options]] on futures.

A [[Derivative (finance)|financial derivative]] is a financial instrument whose value is derived from a commodity termed an [[Underlying|underlier]].&lt;ref name=washingtonpost21apr2010&gt;

An increasing number of derivatives are traded via [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing houses]] some with [[central counterparty clearing]], which provide clearing and settlement services on a futures exchange, as well as off-exchange in the OTC market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm |title=Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago |work=Chicagofed.org |access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derivatives such as futures contracts, [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] (1970s-), Exchange-traded Commodities (ETC) (2003-), forward contracts have become the primary trading instruments in commodity markets. Futures are traded on regulated [[commodities exchange]]s. Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are &quot;privately negotiated bilateral contracts entered into between the contracting parties directly&quot;.&lt;ref name=DerivativesCanada&gt;

[[Exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) began to feature commodities in 2003. Gold ETFs are based on &quot;electronic gold&quot; that does not entail the ownership of physical bullion, with its added costs of insurance and storage in repositories such as the [[London bullion market]]. According to the [[World Gold Council]], ETFs allow investors to be exposed to the gold market without the risk of price [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] associated with gold as a physical commodity.&lt;ref name=GoldMutualVSETF&gt;

== History ==
Commodity-based money and commodity markets in a crude early form are believed to have originated in [[Sumer]] between 4500 BC and 4000 BC. Sumerians first used [[clay]] tokens sealed in a clay vessel, then [[Sumer#Mathematics|clay writing tablets]] to represent the amount—for example, the number of goats, to be delivered.&lt;ref name=forbesindia16jan2013&gt;

Early civilizations variously used pigs, rare seashells, or other items as [[commodity money]]. Since that time traders have sought ways to simplify and standardize trade contracts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=James |first1=Tom |title=Commodity Market Trading and Investment: A Practitioners Guide to the Markets (Global Financial Markets) |date=2016 |isbn=978-1137432803 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsQmDgAAQBAJ&amp;q=At+first+the+precious+metals+were+valued+for+their+beauty+and+intrinsic+worth+and+were+associated+with+royalty&amp;pg=PA7 |access-date=9 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Diamond|first=Jared|title=Guns, Germs and Steel - The Fates of Human Societies|publisher=W.

[[Gold]] and [[silver]] markets evolved in classical civilizations. At first, the precious metals were valued for their beauty and intrinsic worth and were associated with royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=James |first1=Tom |title=Commodity Market Trading and Investment: A Practitioners Guide to the Markets (Global Financial Markets) |date=2016 |isbn=978-1137432803 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsQmDgAAQBAJ&amp;q=At+first+the+precious+metals+were+valued+for+their+beauty+and+intrinsic+worth+and+were+associated+with+royalty&amp;pg=PA7 |access-date=9 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, they were used for trading and were exchanged for other goods and commodities, or for payments of labor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commodityhq.com/2012/a-brief-2000-year-history-of-silver-prices/ The Historical Value of Silver: A 2000-Year Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Gold, measured out, then became money.

Beginning in the late 10th century, commodity markets grew as a mechanism for allocating goods, labor, land and capital across Europe. Between the late 11th and the late 13th century, English urbanization, regional specialization, expanded and improved infrastructure, the increased use of coinage and the proliferation of markets and fairs were evidence of commercialization.&lt;ref name=comarhistoryHolland2010&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of markets is illustrated by the 1466 installation of reliable scales in the villages of Sloten and Osdorp so villagers no longer had to travel to Haarlem or Amsterdam to weigh their locally produced cheese and butter.&lt;ref name=comarhistoryHolland2010 /&gt;

The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]], often cited as the first stock exchange, originated as a market for the exchange of commodities. Early trading on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange often involved the use of very sophisticated contracts, including short sales, forward contracts, and options. &quot;Trading took place at the Amsterdam Bourse, an open aired
venue, which was created as a commodity exchange in 1530 and rebuilt in 1608. Commodity exchanges themselves were a relatively recent invention, existing in only a handful of cities.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stringham&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stringham|first1=Edward|title=The Extralegal Development of Securities Trading in Seventeenth Century Amsterdam|journal=Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance|date=2003|volume=43|issue=2|page=321|ssrn=1676251|doi=10.1016/S1062-9769(02)00153-9|s2cid=153987773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, in the United States, wheat, corn, cattle, and pigs were widely traded using standard instruments on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (CBOT), the world's oldest futures and options exchange. Other food commodities were added to the [[Commodity Exchange Act]] and traded through CBOT in the 1930s and 1940s, expanding the list from grains to include rice, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Irish potatoes and soybeans.&lt;ref&gt;

Through the 19th century &quot;the exchanges became effective spokesmen for, and innovators of, improvements in transportation, warehousing, and financing, which paved the way to expanded interstate and international trade.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=US Commodity Futures Trading Handbook Volume 1 Strategic Information and Regulations |isbn=978-1577516095

==Commodity price index==
In 1934, the US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] began the computation of a daily [[Commodity price index]] that became available to the public in 1940. By 1952, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a [[Spot Market Price Index]] that measured the price movements of &quot;22 sensitive basic commodities whose markets are presumed to be among the first to be influenced by changes in economic conditions. As such, it serves as one early indication of impending changes in business activity.&quot;&lt;ref name=CRBspotindex2006&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commodity index fund==
A [[commodity index fund]] is a fund whose assets are invested in financial instruments based on or linked to a commodity index. In just about every case the index is in fact a Commodity Futures Index. The first such index was the Dow Jones Commodity Index, which began in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document |title=The First Commodity Futures Index of 1933 |ssrn=3451443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first practically investable commodity futures index was the [[Goldman Sachs Commodity Index]], created in 1991,&lt;ref name=&quot;bub&quot;&gt;&quot;The Food Bubble&quot;, Frederick Kaufman, Harper's, 2010 July&lt;/ref&gt; and known as the &quot;GSCI&quot;. The next was the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index. It differed from the GSCI primarily in the weights allocated to each commodity. The DJ AIG had mechanisms to periodically limit the weight of any one commodity and to remove commodities whose weights became too small. After [[AIG]]'s financial problems in 2008 the Index rights were sold to [[UBS]] and it is now known as the DJUBS index. Other commodity indices include the Reuters / CRB index (which is the old CRB Index as re-structured in 2005) and the Rogers Index.

==Cash commodity==
Cash commodities or &quot;actuals&quot; refer to the physical goods—e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans, crude oil, gold, silver—that someone is buying/selling/trading as distinguished from derivatives.&lt;ref name=NFA2006 /&gt;

==Call options ==
In a [[call option]] [[counterparty|counterparties]] enter into a financial contract option where the buyer purchases the right but not the obligation to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the [[strike price]]). The seller (or &quot;writer&quot;) is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument should the buyer so decide. The buyer pays a fee (called a premium) for this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Electronic commodities trading==

In 1992 the  [[Financial Information eXchange]] (FIX) protocol was introduced, allowing international real-time exchange of information regarding market transactions. The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] ordered U.S. stock markets to convert from the [[imperial units|fractional system]] to a [[Decimal|decimal system]] by April 2001. [[Metrification]], conversion from the [[imperial units|imperial system of measurement]] to the [[metric system|metrical]], increased throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref name=decimal&gt;

By 2011, the [[alternative trading system]] (ATS) of [[Electronic communication network|electronic trading]] featured computers buying and selling without human dealer intermediation. [[High-frequency trading]] (HFT) algorithmic trading, had almost phased out &quot;dinosaur floor-traders&quot;.&lt;ref name=highfrequencytrading2011 /&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In July 2009, when a high-frequency trading platform with proprietary [[algorithmic trading code]] used by [[Goldman Sachs]] to allegedly generate massive profits in the commodity market was stolen by [[Sergey Aleynikov]] there was widespread concern about the unintended economic consequences of HFT.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity and interconnectedness of global market===
The robust growth of [[Emerging markets|emerging market economies]] (EMEs, such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China), beginning in the 1990s, &quot;propelled commodity markets into a supercycle&quot;.

and [[pension fund]]s and [[sovereign wealth fund]]s started allocating more capital to commodities, in order to [[Diversification (finance)|diversify]] into an asset class with less exposure to currency depreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=M.

In 2012, as emerging-market economies slowed down, commodity prices peaked and started to decline. From 2005 through 2013, energy and metals' [[Real prices and ideal prices|real prices]] remained well above their long-term averages. In 2012, real [[food prices]] were their highest since 1982.&lt;ref name=BankofCanada25sept2012 /&gt;

The price of gold bullion fell dramatically on 12 April 2013 and analysts frantically sought explanations. Rumors spread that the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) would force [[Cyprus]] to sell its gold reserves in response to its [[2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis|financial crisis]]. Major banks such as [[Goldman Sachs]] began immediately to short gold bullion. Investors scrambled to liquidate their [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs)&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Exchange Traded Funds revolutionized the mutual funds industry when they were introduced. Exchange Traded Commodities, sold first by pioneering investors group Barclays Global Investors (BGI) (now owned by BlackRock)  revolutionized the commodity market. By the end of December 2009 Barclays Global Investors (BGI) assets hit an all-time high of $1&amp;nbsp;trillion ($1,032 billion).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Margin (finance)|margin call selling]] accelerated. George Gero, precious metals commodities expert at the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] (RBC) Wealth Management section reported that he had not seen selling of gold bullion as panicked as this in his forty years in commodity markets.&lt;ref name=Forbes15apr2013&gt;

The earliest commodity exchange-traded fund (ETFs), such as [[SPDR Gold Shares]] {{NYSE Arca|GLD}} and [[iShares]] Silver Trust {{NYSE Arca|SLV}}, actually owned the physical commodities. Similar to these are {{NYSE Arca|PALL}} ([[palladium]]) and {{NYSE Arca|PPLT}} ([[platinum]]). However, most Exchange Traded Commodities (ETCs) implement a [[futures trading]] strategy. At the time Russian Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] warned that Russia could sink into recession. He argued that &quot;We live in a dynamic, fast-developing world. It is so global and so complex that we sometimes cannot keep up with the changes&quot;. Analysts have claimed that Russia's economy is overly dependent on commodities.&lt;ref name=FinancialTimes17apr2013&gt;

===Contracts in the commodity market===
A [[Spot contract]] is an agreement where delivery and payment either takes place immediately, or with a short lag. Physical trading normally involves a visual inspection and is carried out in physical [[Market (place)|market]]s such as a [[Farmers' market|farmers market]]. [[Derivatives market]]s, on the other hand, require the existence of agreed standards so that trades can be made without visual inspection.

===Standardization===
US [[soybean]] futures, for something else, are of not being standard grade if they are &quot;GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Indiana, Ohio and Michigan origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo)&quot;. They are of &quot;deliverable grade&quot; if they are &quot;GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo)&quot;.  Note the distinction between states, and the need to clearly mention their status as GMO ([[genetically modified organism]]) which makes them unacceptable to most [[organic farming|organic]] food buyers.

Similar specifications apply for cotton, orange juice, cocoa, sugar, wheat, corn, barley, [[pork belly|pork bellies]], milk, feed stuffs, fruits, vegetables, other grains, other beans, hay, other livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, or any other commodity which is so traded.

Standardization has also occurred technologically, as the use of the FIX Protocol by commodities exchanges has allowed trade messages to be sent, received and processed in the same format as stocks or equities. This process began in 2001 when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched a FIX-compliant interface that was adopted by commodity exchanges around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;FIXGlobal2011&quot;/&gt;

== History ==

=== Before 1865 ===
 
Fencing consisting of flat and thin wire was first proposed in France, by Leonce Eugene Grassin-Baledans in 1860. His design consisted of bristling points, creating a fence that was painful to cross. In April 1865 Louis François Janin proposed a double wire with diamond-shaped metal barbs; Francois was granted a patent. Michael Kelly from New York had a similar idea, and proposed that the fencing should be used specifically for deterring animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Krell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSYby9zZri0C&amp;pg=PA16 |title=The Devil's Rope: A Cultural History of Barbed Wire|location=London|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd|date=2002|page=16|isbn=9781861891440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More patents followed, and in 1867 alone there were six patents issued for barbed wire. Only two of them addressed livestock deterrence, one of which was from American Lucien B. Smith of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Krell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JSYby9zZri0C&amp;pg=PA19 The Devil's Rope: A Cultural History of Barbed Wire]'' (London: Reaktion Books Ltd, 2002), p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1870, westward movement in the United States was largely across the plains with little or no settlement occurring. After the [[American Civil War]] the plains were extensively settled, consolidating America's dominance over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Netz|2004}}, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranchers moved out on the plains, and needed to fence their land in against encroaching farmers and other ranchers. The railroads throughout the growing West needed to keep livestock off their tracks, and farmers needed to keep stray cattle from trampling their crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krell&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Krell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSYby9zZri0C&amp;pg=PA28 |title=The Devil's Rope: A Cultural History of Barbed Wire|location=London|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd|date=2002|page=28|isbn=9781861891440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional fence materials used in the Eastern U.S., like wood and stone, were expensive to use in the large open spaces of the plains, and hedging was not reliable in the rocky, clay-based and rain-starved dusty soils. A cost-effective alternative was needed to make cattle operations profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCallum|1965}}, p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1873 meeting and initial development ===
[[file:Glidden wire the Winner2.jpg|thumb|An early handmade specimen of Glidden's &quot;The Winner&quot; on display at the Barbed Wire History Museum in [[DeKalb, Illinois]]]]
[[file:Patent Drawing for Joseph F. Glidden's Improvement to Barbed Wire - NARA - 302051.tif|thumb|Patent drawing for [[Joseph F. Glidden]]'s Improvement to barbed wire]]

The &quot;Big Four&quot; in barbed wire were [[Joseph Glidden]], [[Jacob Haish]], Charles Francis Washburn, and [[Isaac L. Ellwood]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Krell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JSYby9zZri0C&amp;pg=PA23 The Devil's Rope: A Cultural History of Barbed Wire]'' (London: Reaktion Books Ltd, 2002), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Glidden, a farmer in 1873 and the first of the &quot;Big Four,&quot; is often credited for designing a successful sturdy barbed wire product, but he let others popularize it for him. Glidden's idea came from a display at a fair in [[DeKalb, Illinois|DeKalb]], [[Illinois]] in 1873, by Henry B. Rose. Rose had patented &quot;The Wooden Strip with Metallic Points&quot; in May 1873.&lt;ref name=&quot;barbwiremuseum1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbwiremuseum.com/barbedwirehistory.htm |title=A Brief History of Barbed Wire |accessdate=July 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721013911/http://www.barbwiremuseum.com/barbedwirehistory.htm |archivedate=July 21, 2010 }}, Devil's Rope Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

This was simply a wooden block with wire protrusions designed to keep cows from breaching the fence. That day, Glidden was accompanied by two other men, Isaac L. Ellwood, a hardware dealer and Jacob Haish, a lumber merchant. Like Glidden, they both wanted to create a more durable wire fence with fixed barbs. Glidden experimented with a grindstone to twist two wires together to hold the barbs on the wire in place. The barbs were created from experiments with a coffee mill from his home.&lt;ref name=&quot;barbwiremuseum1&quot;/&gt;

Later Glidden was joined by Ellwood who knew his design could not compete with Glidden's for which he applied for a patent in October 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCallum|1965}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Haish, who had already secured several patents for barbed wire design, applied for a patent on his third type of wire, the S barb, and accused Glidden of interference, deferring Glidden's approval for his patented wire, nicknamed &quot;The Winner,&quot; until November 24, 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCallum|1965}}, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbed wire production greatly increased with Glidden and Ellwood's establishment of the Barb Fence Company in DeKalb following the success of &quot;The Winner&quot;. The company's success attracted the attention of Charles Francis Washburn, Vice President of Washburn &amp; Moen Manufacturing Company, an important producer of plain wire in the Eastern U.S. Washburn visited De Kalb and convinced Glidden to sell his stake in the Barb Wire Fence Company, while Ellwood stayed in DeKalb and renamed the company I.L Ellwood &amp; Company of DeKalb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCallum|1965}}, p.&amp;nbsp;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion and consolidation ===

In the late 1870s, [[John Warne Gates]] of Illinois began to promote barbed wire, now a proven product, in the lucrative markets of Texas. At first, Texans were hesitant, as they feared that cattle might be harmed, or that the North was somehow trying to make profits from the South. There was also conflict between the farmers who wanted fencing and the ranchers who were losing the [[open range]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Krell&quot; /&gt;

Demonstrations by Gates in [[San Antonio]] in 1876 showed that the wire could keep cattle contained, and sales then increased dramatically. Gates eventually parted company with Ellwood and became a barbed wire baron in his own right. Throughout the height of barbed wire sales in the late 19th century, Washburn, Ellwood, Gates, and Haish competed with one another, but Ellwood and Gates eventually joined forces again to create the American Steel and Wire Company, later acquired by The [[U.S. Steel]] Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M., McFadden, &quot;Monopoly in Barbed Wire: The Formation of the American Steel and Wire Company.&quot; ''The Business History Review'', 52, 4, 1978, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1873 and 1899 there were as many as 150 companies manufacturing barbed wire to cash in on the demand in the West: investors were aware that the business did not require much capital and it was considered that almost anyone with enough determination could make a profit from manufacture of a new wire design.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M., McFadden, &quot;Monopoly in Barbed Wire: The Formation of the American Steel and Wire Company.&quot; ''The Business History Review'', 52, 4, 1978, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; There was then a sharp decline in the number of manufacturing firms, as many were consolidated into larger companies, notably the American Steel and Wire Company, formed by the merging of Gates's and Washburn's and Ellwood's industries.

Smaller companies were wiped out because of economies of scale and the smaller pool of consumers available to them, compared to the larger corporations. The American Steel and Wire Company established in 1899 employed vertical integration: it controlled all aspects of production from producing the steel rods to making many different wire and nail products from the same steel; although later part of U.S. Steel, the production of barbed wire would still be a major source of revenue

Another inventor, [[William C. Edenborn]], a German immigrant who later settled in [[Winn Parish, Louisiana]], [[patent]]ed a machine which simplified the making of barbed wire and cut the unit price of production from {{convert|17|to|3|¢/lb|spell=in}}. His particular wire is the &quot;humane&quot; version that did not harm cattle. The original wire was sharp-teethed and contributed to western range wars. Edenborn's company in time supplied 75 percent of the barbed wire in the United States. A wire nail machine that he also patented reduced the price of wire nails from eight to two cents per pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/la/winn/bios/edenborn.txt|title=Greggory E. Davies, William Edenborn of Winn Parish, La.|publisher=files.usgwarchives.net|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glen Coleman, great-nephew of [[William Edenborn]], wrote ''The Man Who Fenced the West'' about his uncle's accomplishments regarding barbed wire.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the American West ===
[[file:Salsola tragus tumbleweed.jpg|thumb|A [[rangeland]] fence which has caught a [[tumbleweed]]]]

Barbed wire played an important role in the protection of range rights in the Western U.S. Although some ranchers put notices in newspapers claiming land areas, and joined [[stockgrowers association]]s to help enforce their claims, livestock continued to cross range boundaries. Fences of smooth wire did not hold stock well, and hedges were difficult to grow and maintain. Barbed wire's introduction in the West in the 1870s dramatically reduced the cost of enclosing land.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book|title=Free Market Environmentalism|author1=Anderson, Terry Lee |author2=Leal, Donald |name-list-style=amp |pages=30–31|year=2001|publisher=0-312-23503-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[file:Rusty Barbed Wire.jpg|thumb|Rusted barbed wire in a roll]]

One fan wrote the inventor [[Joseph Glidden]]:
:it takes no room, exhausts no soil, shades no vegetation, is proof against high winds, makes no snowdrifts, and is both durable and cheap.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/joseph-glidden-applies-for-a-patent-on-his-barbed-wire-design &quot;1873: Joseph Glidden applies for a patent on his barbed wire design&quot; ''History Channel'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbed wire also emerged as a major source of conflict with the so-called &quot;Big Die Up&quot; incident in the 1880s. This conflict occurred because of the instinctual migrations of cattle away from the blizzard conditions of the Northern Plains to the warmer and plentiful Southern Plains, but by the early 1880s this area was already divided and claimed by ranchers. The ranchers in place, especially in the Texas Panhandle, knew that their holdings could not support the grazing of additional cattle, so the only alternative was to block the migrations with barb wire fencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCallum|1965}}, p.&amp;nbsp;131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the herds were decimated in the winter of 1885, with some losing as many as three-quarters of all animals when they could not find a way around the fence. Later other smaller scale cattlemen, especially in central [[Texas]], opposed the closing of the open range, and began cutting fences to allow cattle to pass through to find grazing land. In this transition zone between the agricultural regions to the south and the rangeland to the north, conflict erupted, with vigilantes joining the scene causing chaos and even death. The [[Fence Cutting Wars]] came to an end with the passage of a Texas law in 1884 that stated among other provisions that fence cutting was a felony; and other states followed, although conflicts still occurred through the opening years of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCallum|1965}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;165–166.&lt;/ref&gt; A federal law passed in 1885 forbade stretching such fences across the public domain.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

Barbed wire is often cited by historians as the invention that truly tamed the West. Herding large numbers of cattle on open terrain required significant manpower just to catch strays, but with an inexpensive method to divide, sub-divide and allocate parcels of land to control the movement of cattle, the need for a vast labor force became unnecessary. By the beginning of the 20th century the need for significant numbers of [[cowboy]]s was not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-sep-02-mn-14602-story.html |title=Honoring the Wire That Won the West |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=26 October 2015 |date=2000-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Southwest United States ===

[[John Warne Gates]] demonstrated barbed wire for Washburn and Moen in [[Military Plaza]], [[San Antonio, Texas]] in 1876. The demonstration showing cattle restrained by the new kind of fencing was followed immediately by invitations to the [[Menger Hotel]] to place orders. Gates subsequently had a falling out with Washburn and Moen and Isaac Ellwood. He moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and founded the Southern Wire Company, which became the largest manufacturer of unlicensed or &quot;bootleg&quot; barbed wire.

An 1880 US District Court decision upheld the validity of the Glidden patent, effectively establishing a monopoly. This decision was affirmed by the [[US Supreme Court]] in 1892. In 1898 Gates took control of Washburn and Moen, and created the American Steel and Wire monopoly, which became a part of the [[United States Steel]] Corporation.

This led to disputes known as the [[range wars]] between open range ranchers and farmers in the late 19th century. These were similar to the disputes which resulted from [[Enclosure|enclosure laws]] in England in the early 18th century. These disputes were decisively settled in favor of the farmers, and heavy penalties were instituted for cutting a barbed wire fence. Within 2 years, nearly all of the open range had been fenced in under private ownership. For this reason, some historians have dated the end of the [[American Old West|Old West]] era of American history to the invention and subsequent proliferation of barbed wire.

[[file:Barbedwire3.jpg|thumb|Barbed wire fence in line brace]]

The most important and most time-consuming part of a barbed wire fence is constructing the ''corner post'' and the bracing assembly. A barbed wire fence is under tremendous tension, often up to half a [[ton]], and so the corner post's sole function is to resist the tension of the fence spans connected to it. The bracing keeps the corner post vertical and prevents slack from developing in the fence.

''Brace posts'' are placed in-line about {{convert|8|ft|m|order=flip|round=0.5}} from the corner post. A horizontal ''compression brace'' connects the top of the two posts, and a diagonal wire connects the top of the brace post to the bottom of the corner post. This diagonal wire prevents the brace post from leaning, which in turn allows the horizontal brace to prevent the corner post from leaning into the brace post. A second set of brace posts (forming a ''double brace'') is used whenever the barbed wire span exceeds {{convert|200|ft|m|order=flip|sigfig=1}}.

When the barbed wire span exceeds {{convert|650|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, a ''braced line assembly'' is added in-line. This has the function of a corner post and brace assembly but handles tension from opposite sides. It uses diagonal brace wire that connects the tops to the bottoms of all adjacent posts.

''Line posts'' are installed along the span of the fence at intervals of {{convert|8|to|50|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip|round=0.5}}. An interval of {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip|round=0.5}} is most common. Heavy livestock and crowded pasture demands the smaller spacing. The sole function of a line post is not to take up slack but to keep the barbed wire strands spaced equally and off the ground.

Once these posts and bracing have been erected, the wire is wrapped around one corner post, held with a hitch (a [[timber hitch]] works well for this) often using a staple to hold the height and then reeled out along the span of the fence replacing the roll every 400 m. It is then wrapped around the opposite corner post, pulled tightly with wire stretchers, and sometimes nailed with more fence staples, although this may make readjustment of tension or replacement of the wire more difficult. Then it is attached to all of the line posts with fencing staples driven in partially to allow stretching of the wire.

There are several ways to anchor the wire to a corner post:

* Hand-knotting. The wire is wrapped around the corner post and knotted by hand. This is the most common method of attaching wire to a corner post. A timber hitch works well as it stays better with wire than with rope.
* Crimp sleeves. The wire is wrapped around the corner post and bound to the incoming wire using metal sleeves which are crimped using lock cutters. This method should be avoided because while sleeves can work well on repairs in the middle of the fence where there is not enough wire for hand knotting, they tend to slip when under tension.
* Wire vise. The wire is passed through a hole drilled into the corner post and is anchored on the far side.
* Wire wrap. The wire is wrapped around the corner post and wrapped onto a special, gritted helical wire which also wraps around the incoming wire, with friction holding it in place.

Barbed wire for agriculture use is typically double-strand {{frac|12|1|2}}-[[American wire gauge|gauge]], [[zinc]]-coated (galvanized) [[steel]] and comes in rolls of {{convert|1320|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} length. Barbed wire is usually placed on the inner (pasture) side of the posts. Where a fence runs between two pastures livestock could be with the wire on the outside or on both sides of the fence.

Galvanized wire is classified into three categories; Classes I, II, and III. Class I has the thinnest coating and the shortest life expectancy. A wire with Class I coating will start showing general rusting in 8 to 10 years, while the same wire with Class III coating will show rust in 15 to 20 years. Aluminum-coated wire is occasionally used, and yields a longer life.

Corner posts are {{convert|6|to|8|in|cm|order=flip}} in diameter or larger, and a minimum {{convert|8|ft|m|order=flip|round=0.5}} in length may consist of treated wood or from durable on-site trees such as osage orange, [[black locust]], [[Juniperus virginiana|red cedar]], or red [[mulberry]], also railroad ties, telephone, and power poles are salvaged to be used as corner posts (poles and railroad ties were often treated with chemicals determined to be an environmental hazard and cannot be reused in some jurisdictions). In Canada spruce posts are sold for this purpose. Posts are {{convert|4|in|cm|order=flip}} in diameter driven at least {{convert|4|ft|m|order=flip}} and may be anchored in a concrete base {{convert|20|in|cm|order=flip}} square and {{convert|42|in|cm|order=flip}} deep. Iron posts, if used, are a minimum {{Convert|2.5|in|mm|order=flip}} in diameter. Bracing wire is typically smooth 9-gauge. Line posts are set to a depth of about {{convert|30|in|cm|order=flip}}. Conversely, steel posts are not as stiff as wood, and wires are fastened with slips along fixed teeth, which means variations in driving height affect wire spacing.

During the First World War, [[screw picket]]s were used for the installation of wire obstacles; these were metal rods with eyelets for holding strands of wire, and a corkscrew-like end that could literally be screwed into the ground rather than hammered, so that [[Wiring party|wiring parties]] could work at night near enemy soldiers and not reveal their position by the sound of hammers.

=== Gates ===
[[file:Wire gate.jpg|thumb|Wire or &quot;Hampshire&quot; gate]]

As with any fence, barbed wire fences require gates to allow the passage of persons, vehicles and farm implements. Gates vary in width from {{convert|12|ft|m|order=flip|round=0.5}} to allow the passage of vehicles and tractors, to {{convert|40|ft|m|order=flip}} on farm land to pass combines and swathers.

One style of gate is called the [[Hampshire gate]] in the UK, a New Zealand gate in some areas, and often simply a &quot;gate&quot; elsewhere. Made of wire with posts attached at both ends and in the middle, it is permanently wired on one side and attaches to a gate post with wire loops on the other. Most designs can be opened by hand, though some gates that are frequently opened and closed may have a lever attached to assist in bringing the upper wire loop over the gate post

Gates for cattle tend to have 4 wires when along a three wire fence, as cattle tend to put more stress on gates, particularly on corner gates. The fence on each side of the gated ends with two corner posts braced or unbraced depending on the size of the post. An unpounded post (often an old broken post) is held to one corner post with wire rings which act as hinges. On the other end a full length post, the tractor post, is placed with the pointed end upwards with a ring on the bottom stapled to the other corner post, the latch post, and on top a ring is stapled to the tractor post, the post is tied with a [[Stockgrower's Lash]] or one of numerous other opening bindings. Wires are then tied around the post at one end then run to the other end where they are stretched by hand or with a stretcher, before posts are stapled on every {{convert|4|ft|m|order=flip}}, often this type of gate is called a [[portagee fence]] or a [[portagee gate]] in various ranching communities of coastal [[Central California]].

Most gates can be opened by push post. The chain is then wrapped around the tractor post and pulled onto the nail, stronger people can pull the gate tighter but anyone can jar off the chain to open the gate.

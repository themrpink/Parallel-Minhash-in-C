A '''chain letter''' is a [[message]] that attempts to convince the recipient to make a number of copies and pass them on to a certain number of recipients. The &quot;chain&quot; is an exponentially growing pyramid (a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree graph]]) that cannot be sustained indefinitely. 

Common methods used in chain letters include [[Psychological manipulation|emotionally manipulative]] stories, [[Make Money Fast|get-rich-quick]] [[pyramid scheme]]s, and the exploitation of [[superstition]] to threaten the recipient. Originally, chain letters were [[Letter (message)|letters]] sent by mail; today, chain letters are often sent electronically via [[email]], [[social network service|social network sites]], and [[Text messaging|text messages]].

== Types ==
There are two main types of chain letter:

# Hoaxes: Hoaxes attempt to trick or defraud users. A hoax could be malicious, instructing users to delete a file necessary to the operating system by claiming it is a virus. It could also be a scam that convinces users to spread the letter to other people for a specific reason, or send money or personal information. [[Phishing]] attacks could fall into this.
# Urban legends: [[Urban legend]]s are designed to be redistributed and usually warn users of a threat or claim to be notifying them of important or urgent information. Another common form are the emails that promise users monetary rewards for forwarding the message or suggest that they are signing something that will be submitted to a particular group. Urban legends usually have no negative effect aside from wasted time.

In the United States, chain letters that request money or other items of value and promise a substantial return to the participants (such as the infamous [[Make Money Fast]] scheme) are illegal.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120508132454/https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/investigations/MailFraud/fraudschemes/sweepstakesfraud/ChainLetters.aspx Chain Letters]&quot;. ''[[United States Postal Inspection Service]]''. Archived from [https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/investigations/MailFraud/fraudschemes/sweepstakesfraud/ChainLetters.aspx the original] on 8 May 2012. ''The [[U.S. Postal Inspection Service]] cites {{USC|18|1302}} when it asserts that chain letters are &quot;illegal if they request money or other items of value and promise a substantial return to the participants, pursuant to {{USC|18|1302|pipe=Title 18, United States Code, Section 1302}}, the Postal Lottery Statute.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some colleges and military bases have passed regulations stating that in the private mail of college students and military personnel, respectively, chain letters are not authorized and will be thrown out. However, it is often difficult to distinguish chain letters from genuine correspondence.

==Channels==

===Print===
[[File:Chain Letter.jpg|thumb|left|Printed Australian chain letter from 2006, with a [[Australian five-cent coin|five-cent coin]] taped to it as what it calls a &quot;financial eye-catcher&quot;]]

The oldest known channel for chain letters is written, or printed, on letters on paper. These might be exchanged hand-to-hand or distributed through the mail. One notorious early example was the &quot;Prosperity Club&quot; or &quot;Send-a-Dime&quot; letter. This letter started in [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1935, based on an earlier luck letter. It soon swamped the Denver post office with hundreds of thousands of letters before spilling into [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and other cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanArsdale 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel W. |last=VanArsdale |title=Chain Letter Evolution |year=1998|url=http://www.silcom.com/~barnowl/chain-letter/evolution.html |accessdate=21 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chain letters take religious perspectives especially relating to Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Often these letters originate from [[photocopy]] centers, claiming to have originated from the [[Pope]], with the intent of persuading people to make copies of such letters. The content usually gives one or two examples of people, sometimes public figures who obeyed and were rewarded and others who disobeyed and suffered heavily, which may even include cases of deaths and of someone becoming a millionaire overnight.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} These types of letters will flourish for some days and will die out naturally, partly based on the economic realities of the people, and maybe many would also reason that if that was truly the original letter, then it cannot contain cases of people who had broken or continued the chain.

===Email===
Some email messages sent as chain letters may seem fairly harmless, for example, a grammar school student wishing to see how many people can receive his/her email for a science project, but can grow exponentially and be hard to stop. Messages sometimes include phony promises from companies or wealthy individuals (such as [[Bill Gates]]) promising a monetary reward to everyone who receives the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Barbara |last=Mikkelson |author2=David Mikkelson |title=Thousand Dollar Bill |work=Urban Legends Reference Pages |url=http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/nothing/billgate.asp |accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be politically motivated, such as &quot;Save the Scouts, forward this to as many friends as possible&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Barbara |last=Mikkelson |author2=David Mikkelson |title=A Boy Scout Outing |work=Urban Legends Reference Pages |url=http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/petition/boyscout.asp |accessdate=6 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a concept that a popular TV or radio show may be forced off the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Barbara |last= Mikkelson |author2=David Mikkelson |title=Petition to Ban Religious Broadcasting |work=Urban Legends Reference Pages |url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/fcc.asp |accessdate= 6 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like the ''Hawaiian Good Luck Totem'', which has spread in thousands of forms, threaten users with bad luck if not forwarded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Newton (author)|Newton, Michael]] (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sAK6_W7lLkoC The encyclopedia of high-tech crime and crime-fighting]''. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many forms of chain email that threaten death or the taking of one's soul by telling tales of others' deaths, such as the Katu Lata Kulu chain email, stating that if it is not forwarded, the receivers of the message will be killed by the [[spirit]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Platforms like [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]] can host chain letters playing with users' emotions. They may also be in the form of a warning, such as stories of escaped convicts, which urge the reader to pass the message on. One chain letter distributed on MSN [[Hotmail]] began, &quot;Hey it's Tara and John the directors of MSN&quot;... and subsequently claimed readers' accounts would be deleted if they did not message to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4778046.stm |title=Thousands fall for hotmail prank |accessdate=27 May 2008 |work=BBC News |date=8 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common form of email chain letter is the [[virus hoax]] and a form of [[cyberbullying]].

===Web communities===
Chain letters within social media platforms became widespread on [[Myspace]] (in the form of Myspace bulletins) and [[YouTube]] (in the form of video comments) as well as on [[Facebook]] through messages or applications. For instance, the chain post/email of [[Carmen Winstead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/winstead.asp |title=MySpace Ghost of Murdered Teen |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=22 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; supposedly about a girl from [[Indiana]] who was pushed down a sewage drain in a firedrill, states that, &quot;if you do not repost/send this to 10 people, Carmen will find you and kill you.&quot; Chain letters are often coupled with intimidating [[hoax]]es or the promise of providing the sender with &quot;secret&quot; information once they have forwarded the message.

==Legality==
{{globalize|date=July 2014}}
A chain letter may qualify as a fraudulent activity, as in the case of a [[pyramid scheme]] which asks recipients to funnel money up the chain while requesting the letter be distributed to multiple new recipients.

The legality of chain letters comes into question when they attempt to funnel monetary value to a single recipient. When a chain letter suggests a game of chance or a lottery with an opportunity for financial gain it is considered fraudulent under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1302, the [[Postal Lottery Statute]]. Chain letters that ask for items of minor value such as business cards or recipes are not covered by this law.

If pyramid scheme chain letters are sent through email it may constitute [[wire fraud]]. An email chain letter may contain [[trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] or another type of [[computer virus]] which is covered under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) [18 U.S.C. Section 1030]. This law makes it illegal to distribute computer codes or place them in the stream of commerce if their intent is to cause damage or economic loss.

Because of all these advantages, and because recent advances in [[wideband]] [[communication channel]]s and [[solid-state electronics]] have allowed scientists to fully realize these advantages, digital communications has grown quickly. Digital communications is quickly edging out analog communication because of the vast demand to transmit computer data and the ability of digital communications to do so.

The digital revolution has also resulted in many digital [[telecommunication]] applications where the principles of data transmission are applied. Examples are [[2G|second-generation]] (1991) and later [[cellular telephony]], [[video conferencing]], [[digital TV]] (1998), [[digital radio]] (1999), [[telemetry]], etc.

Data transmission, digital transmission or digital communications is the physical transfer of data (a digital bit stream or a digitized analog signal[1]) over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel. Examples of such channels are copper wires, optical fibers, wireless communication channels, storage media and computer buses. The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, radiowave, microwave, or infrared signal.

While analog transmission is the transfer of a continuously varying analog signal over an analog channel, digital communications is the transfer of discrete messages over a digital or an analog channel. The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code (baseband transmission), or by a limited set of continuously varying wave forms (passband transmission), using a digital modulation method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation (also known as detection) is carried out by modem equipment. According to the most common definition of digital signal, both baseband and passband signals representing bit-streams are considered as digital transmission, while an alternative definition only considers the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital data as a form of digital-to-analog conversion.

Data transmitted may be digital messages originating from a data source, for example a computer or a keyboard. It may also be an analog signal such as a phone call or a video signal, digitized into a bit-stream for example using pulse-code modulation (PCM) or more advanced source coding (analog-to-digital conversion and data compression) schemes. This source coding and decoding is carried out by codec equipment.

==Serial and parallel transmission==
In telecommunications, [[serial transmission]] is the sequential [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[signal element]]s of a group representing a [[Character (computing)|character]] or other entity of [[data]]. Digital serial transmissions are bits sent over a single wire, frequency or optical path sequentially. Because it requires less [[signal processing]] and less chances for error than parallel transmission, the [[transfer rate]] of each individual path may be faster. This can be used over longer distances as a check digit or [[parity bit]] can be sent along it easily.

In telecommunications, [[parallel transmission]] is the simultaneous transmission of the [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] elements of a character or other entity of data. In [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital]] communications, parallel transmission is the simultaneous transmission of related signal elements over two or more separate paths. Multiple electrical wires are used which can transmit multiple bits simultaneously, which allows for higher data transfer rates than can be achieved with serial transmission. This method is used internally within the computer, for example the internal buses, and sometimes externally for such things as printers, The major issue with this is &quot;skewing&quot; because the wires in parallel data transmission have slightly different properties (not intentionally) so some bits may arrive before others, which may corrupt the message. A parity bit can help to reduce this. However, electrical wire parallel data transmission is therefore less reliable for long distances because corrupt transmissions are far more likely.

==Communication channels==

Some communications channel types include:
* [[Data transmission circuit]]
* [[Duplex (telecommunications)#Full-duplex|Full-duplex]]
* [[Duplex (telecommunications)#Half-duplex|Half-duplex]]
* [[Multidrop bus|Multi-drop]]:
** [[Bus network]]
** [[Mesh network]]
** [[Ring network]]
** [[Star network]]
** [[Wireless network]]
* [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|Point-to-point]]
* [[Simplex communication|Simplex]]

==Asynchronous and synchronous data transmission==
{{Main|Comparison of synchronous and asynchronous signalling}}

[[Asynchronous serial communication]] uses start and stop bits to signify the beginning and end of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/6051/asynchronous-transmission|title=What is Asynchronous Transmission? - Definition from Techopedia|work=Techopedia.com|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of transmission is used when data are sent intermittently as opposed to in a solid stream. 

Synchronous transmission synchronizes transmission speeds at both the receiving and sending end of the transmission using [[clock]] signals. The clock may be a separate signal or embedded in the data. A continual stream of [[data]] is then sent between the two nodes. Due to there being no start and stop [[bit]]s the data transfer rate is more efficient.

{{Short description|Algebra over the real number field, with nil-squaring element adjoined}}

In [[linear algebra]], the '''dual numbers''' extend the [[real number]]s by adjoining one new element {{mvar|ε}} (epsilon) with the property {{math|''ε''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}} ({{mvar|ε}} is [[nilpotent]]). Thus the multiplication of dual numbers is given by

: &lt;math&gt; (a+b\varepsilon)(c+d\varepsilon) = ac + (ad+bc)\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;

(and addition is done componentwise).

The collection of dual numbers forms a particular two-[[Hamel dimension|dimensional]] [[commutative algebra|commutative]] [[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra]] over the real numbers. Every dual number has the form {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''a'' + ''bε''}} where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are uniquely determined real numbers. The dual numbers can also be thought of as the [[exterior algebra]] of a one-dimensional vector space; the general case of {{mvar|n}} dimensions leads to the [[Grassmann number]]s.

The [[algebra over a field|algebra]] of dual numbers is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] that is a [[local ring]] since the [[principal ideal]] generated by {{mvar|ε}} is its only [[maximal ideal]]. Dual numbers form the [[coefficient]]s of [[dual quaternion]]s.

Like the [[complex numbers]] and [[split-complex numbers]], the dual numbers form an [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] that is 2-dimensional over the field of real numbers.

==History==
Dual numbers were introduced in 1873 by [[William Kingdon Clifford|William Clifford]], and were used at the beginning of the twentieth century by the German mathematician [[Eduard Study]], who used them to represent the dual angle which measures the relative position of two skew lines in space. Study defined a dual angle as {{math|''ϑ'' + ''dε''}}, where {{mvar|ϑ}} is the angle between the directions of two lines in three-dimensional space and {{mvar|d}} is a distance between them. The {{mvar|n}}-dimensional generalization, the [[Grassmann number]], was introduced by [[Hermann Grassmann]] in the late 19th century.

==Linear representation==
Using [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], dual numbers can be represented as
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\quad\text{and}\quad a + b\varepsilon = \begin{pmatrix}a &amp; b \\ 0 &amp; a \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative representation, noted as &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;\hat{\varepsilon}_{-}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dattoli|first=G.|last2=Licciardi|first2=S.|last3=Pidatella|first3=R. M.|last4=Sabia|first4=E.|date=July 2018|title=Hybrid Complex Numbers: The Matrix Version|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00006-018-0870-y|journal=Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=58|doi=10.1007/s00006-018-0870-y|issn=0188-7009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with the former noted also as &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;\hat{\varepsilon}_{+}&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\varepsilon}_{-}=\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 0 \\1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} = \hat{\varepsilon}_{+}^\operatorname{T} \quad\text{and}\quad a + b\hat{\varepsilon}_{-} = \begin{pmatrix}a &amp; 0 \\ b &amp; a \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}a &amp; b \\ 0 &amp; a \end{pmatrix}^\operatorname{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

The sum and product of dual numbers are then calculated with ordinary [[matrix addition]] and [[matrix multiplication]]; both operations are commutative and associative within the algebra of dual numbers.

This correspondence is analogous to the usual [[Complex number#Matrix representation of complex numbers|matrix representation of complex numbers]].
However, it is ''not'' the only representation with [[2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 real matrices]], as is shown in the [[2 × 2 real matrices#Profile|profile of 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 real matrices]].

==Geometry==
The &quot;unit circle&quot; of dual numbers consists of those with {{math|''a'' {{=}} ±1}} since these satisfy {{math|''zz''* {{=}} 1}} where {{math|''z''* {{=}} ''a'' − ''bε''}}. However, note that
:&lt;math&gt; e^{b \varepsilon} = \left(\sum^\infty_{n=0} \frac{\left(b\varepsilon\right)^n}{n!} \right) = 1 + b \varepsilon, &lt;/math&gt;
so the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] applied to the {{mvar|ε}}-axis covers only half the &quot;circle&quot;.

Let {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''a'' + ''bε''}}. If {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}} and {{math|''m'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, then {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''a''(1 + ''mε'')}} is the [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]] of the dual number {{mvar|z}}, and the [[slope]] {{mvar|m}} is its angular part. The concept of a ''rotation'' in the dual number plane is equivalent to a vertical [[shear mapping]] since {{math|(1 + ''pε'')(1 + ''qε'') {{=}} 1 + (''p'' + ''q'')''ε''}}.

In [[absolute space and time]] the [[Galilean transformation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left(t',x'\right) = (t,x)\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; v \\0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
that is
:&lt;math&gt;t'=t,\quad x' = vt + x , &lt;/math&gt;
relates the resting coordinates system to a moving frame of reference of [[velocity]] {{mvar|v}}. With dual numbers {{math|''t'' + ''xε''}} representing [[event (relativity)|event]]s along one space dimension and time, the same transformation is effected with multiplication by {{math|1 + ''vε''}}.

===Cycles===
Given two dual numbers {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}}, they determine the set of {{mvar|z}} such that the difference in slopes (&quot;Galilean angle&quot;) between the lines from {{mvar|z}} to {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} is constant. This set is a '''cycle''' in the dual number plane; since the equation setting the difference in slopes of the lines to a constant is a [[quadratic equation]] in the real part of {{mvar|z}}, a cycle is a [[parabola]]. The &quot;cyclic rotation&quot; of the dual number plane occurs as a motion of [[#Projective line|its projective line]]. According to [[Isaak Yaglom]],&lt;ref name=&quot;yaglom&quot;/&gt;{{rp|92–93}} the cycle {{math|''Z'' {{=}} {''z'' : ''y'' {{=}} ''αx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} is invariant under the composition of the shear
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = x ,\quad  y_1 = vx + y &lt;/math&gt;
with the [[translation (geometry)|translation]]
:&lt;math&gt;x' = x_1 = \frac{v}{2a}  ,\quad  y' = y_1 + \frac{v^2}{4a}. &lt;/math&gt;
This composition is a '''cyclic rotation'''; the concept has been further developed by Kisil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|first=V. V.|last=Kisil|date=2007|title=Inventing a Wheel, the Parabolic One|arxiv=0707.4024|class=math}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algebraic properties==
In [[abstract algebra]] terms, the dual numbers can be described as the [[quotient ring|quotient]] of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|ℝ[''X'']}} by the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the [[polynomial]] {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}},

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}[X] / \left(X^2\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The image of {{mvar|X}} in the quotient is {{mvar|ε}}. With this description, it is clear that the dual numbers form a [[commutative ring]] with [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. The inherited multiplication gives the dual numbers the structure of a commutative and [[associative algebra]] over the reals of dimension two. The algebra is ''not'' a [[division algebra]] or [[field (mathematics)|field]] since the elements of the form {{math|0 + ''bε''}} are not invertible. All elements of this form are [[zero divisor]]s (also see the section &quot;[[#Division|Division]]&quot;). The algebra of dual numbers is isomorphic to the [[exterior algebra]] of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

==Generalization==
This construction can be carried out more generally: for a [[commutative ring]] {{mvar|R}} one can define the dual numbers over {{mvar|R}} as the [[quotient ring|quotient]] of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''R''[''X'']}} by the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] {{math|(''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}: the image of {{mvar|X}} then has square equal to zero and corresponds to the element {{mvar|ε}} from above.

=== Dual numbers over an arbitrary ring ===
This ring and its generalisations play an important part in the algebraic theory of [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivations]] and [[Kähler differential]]s (purely algebraic [[differential form]]s). Namely, the tangent bundle of a scheme over an affine base {{mvar|R}} can be identified with the points of {{math|''X''(''R''[''ε''])}}. For example, consider the affine scheme
:&lt;math&gt; X = \operatorname{Spec}(S) = \operatorname{Spec}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y]}{(xy)} \right) \in ({\operatorname{Sch}}/\mathbb{C})_\text{Zar} &lt;/math&gt;
Recall that maps {{math|Spec(ℂ[''ε'']) → ''X''}} are equivalent to maps {{math|''S'' → ℂ[''ε'']}}. Then, every map {{mvar|φ}} can be defined as sending the generators
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\varphi(x) &amp;= x_0 + x_1 \varepsilon \\
\varphi(y) &amp;= y_0 + y_1 \varepsilon
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the relation
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\varphi(xy) &amp;= \varphi(x)\varphi(y) \\
&amp;= (x_0 + x_1 \varepsilon)(y_0 + y_1 \varepsilon) \\
&amp;= x_0y_0 + (x_0y_1 + x_1y_0)\varepsilon \\
&amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
holds. This gives us a presentation of {{mvar|TX}} as
:&lt;math&gt;
TX = \text{Spec}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x_0,y_0,x_1,y_1]}{(x_0y_0, x_0y_1 + x_1y_0)} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Explicit tangent vectors ====
For example, a tangent vector at a point &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \in X&lt;/math&gt; can be found by restricting&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;TX|_{(x,y)} = \text{Spec}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x_0,y_0,x_1,y_1]}{(x_0y_0, x_0y_1 + x_1y_0, x_0 - x, y_0 - y)} \right) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;and taking a point in the fiber. For example, over the origin, &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, this is given by the scheme&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
TX|_{(0,0)}&amp;\cong \text{Spec}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x_0,y_0,x_1,y_1]}{(x_0y_0, x_0y_1 + x_1y_0, x_0,y_0)} \right) \\
&amp;\cong\text{Spec}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x_1,y_1]}{(0\cdot y_1 + x_1\cdot 0)} \right) \\
&amp;\cong \text{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[x_1,y_1])
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;and a tangent vector &lt;math&gt;x: \text{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[\varepsilon]) \to X&lt;/math&gt; is given by a ring morphism &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; sending&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x &amp; \mapsto 0 + \varepsilon x_1 \\
y &amp; \mapsto 0 + \varepsilon y_1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;At the point &lt;math&gt;(a,0)&lt;/math&gt; the tangent space is&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
TX|_{(a,0)}&amp;\cong \text{Spec}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x_0,y_0,x_1,y_1]}{(x_0y_0, x_0y_1 + x_1y_0, x_0 - a,y_0)} \right) \\
&amp;\cong\text{Spec}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x_1,y_1]}{(a\cdot y_1)} \right) \\
&amp;\cong \text{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[x_1])
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;hence a tangent vector &lt;math&gt;x: \text{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[\varepsilon]) \to X&lt;/math&gt; is given by a ring morphism &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; sending&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x &amp; \mapsto a + \varepsilon x_1 \\
y &amp; \mapsto 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;which is to be expected. Note this only gives one free parameter, compared to the last calculation, showing the tangent space is only of dimension one, as expected since this is a smooth point of dimension one.

Over any ring {{mvar|R}}, the dual number {{math|''a'' + ''bε''}} is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (i.e. multiplicatively invertible) if and only if {{mvar|a}} is a unit in {{mvar|R}}. In this case, the inverse of {{math|''a'' + ''bε''}} is {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; − ''ba''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;''ε''}}. As a consequence, we see that the dual numbers over any [[field (mathematics)|field]] (or any commutative [[local ring]]) form a local ring, its maximal ideal being the [[principal ideal]] generated by&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|ε}}.

A narrower generalization is that of introducing {{mvar|n}} anticommuting generators; these are the [[Grassmann number]]s or ''supernumbers'', discussed below.

=== Dual numbers with arbitrary coefficients ===
There is a more general construction of the dual numbers with more general infinitesimal coefficients. Given a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and a module &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, there is a ring &lt;math&gt;R[I]&lt;/math&gt; called the ring of dual numbers which has the following structures:

# It has the underlying &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;R\oplus I&lt;/math&gt;
# The algebra structure is given by ring multiplication &lt;math&gt;(r,i)\cdot (r',i') = (rr', ri' + r'i)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;r,r' \in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i,i' \in I&lt;/math&gt;

This generalized the previous construction where &lt;math&gt;I=R&lt;/math&gt; gives the ring &lt;math&gt;R[R]&lt;/math&gt; which has the same multiplication structure as &lt;math&gt;R[\varepsilon]&lt;/math&gt; since any element &lt;math&gt;f + \varepsilon g&lt;/math&gt; is just a sum of two elements in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, but the second is indexed in a different position.

=== Dual numbers of sheaves ===
If we have a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with a sheaf of rings &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt; and a sheaf of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;-modules &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a sheaf of rings &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X[\mathcal{I}]&lt;/math&gt; whose sections over an open set &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X(U)[\mathcal{I}(U)]&lt;/math&gt;. This generalizes in an obvious way to ringed topoi in [[Topos theory]].

==== Dual numbers on a scheme ====
A scheme is a special example of a ringed space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{O}_X)&lt;/math&gt;. The same construction can be used to construct a scheme &lt;math&gt;X[\mathcal{I}]&lt;/math&gt; whose underlying topological space is given by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; but whose sheaf of rings is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X[\mathcal{I}]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Superspace==
Dual numbers find applications in [[physics]], where they constitute one of the simplest non-trivial examples of a [[superspace]]. Equivalently, they are [[Grassmann number|supernumbers]] with just one generator; supernumbers generalize the concept to {{mvar|n}} distinct generators {{mvar|ε}}, each anti-commuting, possibly taking {{mvar|n}} to infinity. Superspace generalizes supernumbers slightly, by allowing multiple commuting dimensions.

The motivation for introducing dual numbers into physics follows from the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for  fermions. The direction along {{mvar|ε}} is termed the &quot;fermionic&quot; direction, and the real component is termed the &quot;bosonic&quot; direction. The fermionic direction earns this name from the fact that [[fermion]]s obey the Pauli exclusion principle: under the exchange of coordinates, the quantum mechanical wave function changes sign, and thus vanishes if two coordinates are brought together; this physical idea is captured by the algebraic relation&amp;nbsp;{{math|''ε''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}.

==Differentiation==
One application of dual numbers is [[automatic differentiation]]. Consider the real dual numbers above. Given any real polynomial {{math|''P''(''x'') {{=}} ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it is straightforward to extend the domain of this polynomial from the reals to the dual numbers. Then we have this result:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P(a+b\varepsilon)= {} &amp;p_0 + p_1(a + b\varepsilon) + \cdots + p_n(a + b\varepsilon)^n\\[5pt]
= {} &amp;p_0 + p_1 a + p_2 a^2 + \cdots + p_n a^n + p_1 b\varepsilon + 2 p_2 a b\varepsilon + \cdots + n p_n a^{n-1} b\varepsilon\\[5pt]
= {} &amp;P(a)+bP^\prime(a)\varepsilon,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''P''′}} is the derivative of {{mvar|P}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berland|first=Håvard|title=Automatic differentiation|url=http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~berland/resources/autodiff-triallecture.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By computing over the dual numbers, rather than over the reals, we can use this to compute derivatives of polynomials.

More generally, we can extend any (analytic) real function to the dual numbers by looking at its [[Taylor series]]:

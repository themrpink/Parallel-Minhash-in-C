'''Slovak(Slovakia) language is actually Slovenian(Slovenia)'''

'''Chinese (unicode?) article title created, breaks interface''' [[user:The Anome|The Anome]], Thursday, April 4, 2002

Some one has managed to create
f

with all sorts of nasty consequences (try to edit it, for example).

:Removed it manually. This (the link problems) should already be fixed in CVS. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Thursday, April 4, 2002

This may be the same issue as above. Go to [[Poincaré conjecture]], then click on &quot;edit this link&quot;. On IE 6, I get a page &quot;PoincarÃ© conjecture&quot;. In order to actually edit the article, or access its history, you'll have to manually enter something like 
: http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Poincar%E9_conjecture&amp;action=edit
I suppose the links produced by the script should always use these % escapes for non-ascii characters.

'''Non-ascii in titles'''

* (2002/1/21) -- ISO-8859-2 characters cannot be in title of article - number of international wikipedias need this ...
** I'll wait for the English script and the bomis CVS to go online, there are some people who know the character encoding things better than me... --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

'''Japanese Wikipedia marked as ISO 8859-1''' 2001-12-31

http://ja.wikipedia.com is illegible with IE 5.0 (Mac) because its HTTP (MIME) header
includes the line 

Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

The charset should be changed to something appropriate (Shift_JIS or UTF8), or
removed and replaced by the equivalent META tag.

:The Japanese wikipedia now puts out &quot;x-sjis&quot; in its headers, Shift-JIS is allowed in page titles, and it is more or less usable.

==Technical: IPA==

''Moved from [[Wikipedia:Village Pump]]''

Why is it that on IE 5, while [http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/ipa-unicode.htm this web site] can display every single IPA letters and diacritics correctly, none of the Wikipedias can display any, except the standard 26 English letters? Something looks wrong. We should better WP. --[[User:Menchi|Menchi]] 07:13 May 7, 2003 (UTC)

::That reminds me, are there plans afoot for following [[LiveJournal]] and using UTF-8?  (LJ did so, and arranged for server-side on-the-fly translation of &quot;legacy&quot; entries to UTF-8 - and LJ is a good example because that's mostly user-contributed content too.  Most users were unware of the change to UTF-8, but those that maintained journals in non-english charsets were overjoyed.)  [[User:Tenbaset|Tenbaset]] 23:21 May 7, 2003 (UTC)

:::We already run in UTF-8 on all phase 3 wikis except for English, Danish, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Swedish. The reason the western European languages haven't been moved over yet is that when you edit a page on a wiki, your browser has a chance to screw up not just your contributions but the ''entire'' contents of the page. It happens fairly regularly on meta and wiktionary that someone (usually our dear [[User:Anthere|Anthere]] :) destroys every non-ASCII character in a page by making an edit with a browser that has broken UTF-8 support, and someone else has to go in and fix them. Until we either banish all such browsers ;) or make tweaks to make safe round-trip edits in those browsers without inconveniencing the rest of us with too much armor, the western european languages will stay in Latin-1.

'''Ella Jane Fitzgerald ''' (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer, sometimes referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz, and Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing, timing, [[Intonation (music)|intonation]], and a &quot;horn-like&quot; improvisational ability, particularly in her [[scat singing]].

After a tumultuous adolescence, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the [[Chick Webb]] Orchestra, performing across the country but most often associated with the [[Savoy Ballroom]] in Harlem. Her rendition of the nursery rhyme &quot;[[A-Tisket, A-Tasket]]&quot; helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. After taking over the band when Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start her solo career.

Her manager was Moe Gale, co-founder of the Savoy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/the-savoy-ballroom-opens|title=The Savoy Ballroom opens {{!}} African American Registry|website=Aaregistry.org|access-date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; until she turned the rest of her career over to [[Norman Granz]], who founded [[Verve Records]] to produce new records by Fitzgerald. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretations of the [[Great American Songbook]].

While Fitzgerald appeared in movies and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century, her musical collaborations with [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]], and [[The Ink Spots]] were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career. These partnerships produced some of her best-known songs such as &quot;[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]&quot;, &quot;[[Cheek to Cheek]]&quot;, &quot;[[Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall]]&quot;, and &quot;[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]&quot;.

In 1993, after a career of nearly 60 years, she gave her last public performance. Three years later, she died at the age of 79 after years of declining health. Her accolades included fourteen [[Grammy Awards]], the [[National Medal of Arts]], and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

==Early life==
Fitzgerald was born on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellafitzgerald.com/about/biography|title=Biography|date=March 11, 2015|website=Ella Fitzgerald|accessdate=December 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of William Fitzgerald and Temperance &quot;Tempie&quot; Henry.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=4}} Her parents were unmarried but lived together in the [[East End section]] of Newport News&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker 2011 p. 302&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitaker |first=Matthew |title=Icons of Black America: Breaking Barriers and Crossing Boundaries |publisher=Greenwood |location=Santa Barbara, CA, US |year=2011 |isbn=9780313376436 |oclc=781709336 |page=302 |volume=v. 1 |url={{Google books|RSGhEUq5bp0C|page=302|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; for at least two and a half years after she was born. In the early 1920s, Fitzgerald's mother and her new partner, a Portuguese immigrant named Joseph Da Silva,{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=4}} moved to [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], [[New York (state)|New York]].{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=4}} Her half-sister, Frances Da Silva, was born in 1923.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=5}} By 1925, Fitzgerald and her family had moved to nearby School Street, a poor Italian area.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=5}} She began her formal education at the age of six and was an outstanding student, moving through a variety of schools before attending Benjamin Franklin Junior High School in 1929.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=7, 13}}

Starting in third grade, Fitzgerald loved dancing and admired [[Earl Snakehips Tucker]]. She performed for her peers on the way to school and at lunchtime.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=6}} She and her family were [[Methodists]] and were active in the Bethany [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], where she attended worship services, Bible study, and Sunday school.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=6}} The church provided Fitzgerald with her earliest experiences in music.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=7}}

Fitzgerald listened to jazz recordings by [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Bing Crosby]], and [[The Boswell Sisters]]. She loved the Boswell Sisters' lead singer [[Connee Boswell]], later saying, &quot;My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it...I tried so hard to sound just like her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=Ella Fitzgerald, the Voice of Jazz, Dies at 79|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 16, 1996|accessdate=March 23, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/16/nyregion/ella-fitzgerald-the-voice-of-jazz-dies-at-79.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, when Fitzgerald was fifteen, her mother died from injuries sustained in a car accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Biography| url=http://www.ellafitzgerald.com/about/biography|publisher=EllaFitzgerald.com (Official website)| accessdate=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stepfather took care of her until April 1933 when she moved to Harlem to live with her aunt.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=14}} This seemingly swift change in her circumstances, reinforced by what Fitzgerald biographer Stuart Nicholson describes as rumors of  &quot;ill treatment&quot; by her stepfather, leaves him to speculate that Da Silva might have abused her.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=14}}

Fitzgerald began skipping school, and her grades suffered. She worked as a lookout at a bordello and with a Mafia-affiliated [[Numbers game|numbers]] runner.&lt;ref name=&quot;rich&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Rich|first=Frank|title=Journal; How High the Moon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/19/opinion/journal-how-high-the-moon.html|accessdate=February 22, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 19, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; She never talked publicly about this time in her life.&lt;ref name = &quot;ThisDay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Ella Fitzgerald is born|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ella-fitzgerald-is-born|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV network)|History]]|accessdate=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the authorities caught up with her, she was placed in the [[Colored Orphan Asylum]] in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] in the Bronx.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernstein&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Nina|title=Ward of the State; The Gap in Ella Fitzgerald's Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/weekinreview/ward-of-the-state-the-gap-in-ella-fitzgerald-s-life.html|accessdate=February 22, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 23, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the orphanage proved too crowded, she was moved to the [[New York Training School for Girls]], a state reformatory school in Hudson, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/weekinreview/ward-of-the-state-the-gap-in-ella-fitzgerald-s-life.html|title=Ward of the State;The Gap in Ella Fitzgerald's Life|last=Bernstein|first=Nina|date=June 23, 1996|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 12, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
[[File:Ella Fitzgerald (1940).jpg|thumb|upright|A young Fitzgerald, photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]] in January 1940]]
While she seems to have survived during 1933 and 1934 in part from singing on the streets of [[Harlem]], Fitzgerald made her most important debut at age 17 on November 21, 1934, in one of the earliest [[Apollo Theater#Amateur Nights|Amateur Nights]] at the [[Apollo Theater]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FrittsVail2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fritts|first1=Ron|last2=Vail|first2=Ken|title=Ella Fitzgerald: The Chick Webb Years &amp; Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W13y4UwnHIcC&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=February 23, 2014|year=2003|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|isbn=978-0-8108-4881-8|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oliver2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Horton|first=James Oliver|title=Landmarks of African American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVBrIZLlqcMC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-514118-4|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had intended to go on stage and dance, but she was intimidated by a local dance duo called the Edwards Sisters and opted to sing instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oliver2005&quot;/&gt;{{sfn |Hemming |Hajdu |1991|p=97}} Performing in the style of [[Connee Boswell]], she sang &quot;Judy&quot; and &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; and won first prize.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9606/15/fitzgerald.obit/index.html|date=June 15, 1996|title='First Lady of Song' passes peacefully, surrounded by family|first=Jim|last=Moret|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=January 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129231320/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9606/15/fitzgerald.obit/index.html|archivedate=November 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won the chance to perform at the Apollo for a week but, seemingly because of her disheveled appearance, the theater never gave her that part of her prize.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=19}}

In January 1935, Fitzgerald won the chance to perform for a week with the [[Tiny Bradshaw]] band at the [[Harlem Opera House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FrittsVail2003&quot;/&gt; She was introduced to drummer and bandleader [[Chick Webb]], who had asked his recently signed singer Charlie Linton to help find him a female singer. Although Webb was &quot;reluctant to sign her...because she was gawky and unkempt, a 'diamond in the rough,'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyobit&quot;/&gt; he offered her the opportunity to test with his band when they played a dance at Yale University.&lt;ref name=&quot;FrittsVail2003&quot;/&gt;

Met with approval by both audiences and her fellow musicians, Fitzgerald was asked to join Webb's orchestra and gained acclaim as part of the group's performances at Harlem's [[Savoy Ballroom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FrittsVail2003&quot;/&gt; Fitzgerald recorded several hit songs, including &quot;Love and Kisses&quot; and &quot;[[(If You Can't Sing It) You'll Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini)]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FrittsVail2003&quot;/&gt; But it was her 1938 version of the nursery rhyme, &quot;[[A-Tisket, A-Tasket]]&quot;, a song she co-wrote, that brought her public acclaim. &quot;A-Tisket, A-Tasket&quot; became a major hit on the radio and was also one of the biggest-selling records of the decade.{{sfn |Hemming |Hajdu |1991|p=97}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Robinson|first1=Louie|title=First Lady of Jazz|magazine=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|date=November 1961|volume=17|issue=1|pages=131–132, 139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89YDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA131| accessdate=October 10, 2014|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|issn=0012-9011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the demise of the [[swing era]] and the decline of the great touring [[big band]]s, a major change in jazz music occurred. The advent of [[bebop]] led to new developments in Fitzgerald's vocal style, influenced by her work with [[Dizzy Gillespie]]'s big band. It was in this period that Fitzgerald started including [[scat singing]] as a major part of her performance repertoire. While singing with Gillespie, Fitzgerald recalled, &quot;I just tried to do [with my voice] what I heard the horns in the band doing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;/&gt;

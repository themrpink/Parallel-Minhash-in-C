===Administrative subdivisions===
{{Main|Wards of Turku}}
[[File:Stålarminkatu-Mestarinkatu.jpg|thumb|right|[[IV District, Turku|IV District]], or Martti, is one of the smallest but most densely populated districts of Turku.]]
The city is divided into 78 districts and nine [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]] that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are [[Varissuo]] and [[Runosmäki]]. By area, however, [[Kakskerta]] and [[Paattinen]], formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

As many of the small neighbouring [[municipalities of Finland|municipalities]] from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated [[pear]]. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku [[Bypass (road)|bypass]], that forms part of [[European route E18]]. Islands such as [[Ruissalo]], [[Hirvensalo]] and [[Kakskerta]], forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into [[upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[suburb]]s.

===Climate===
[[File:Autumn in Turku.jpg|thumb|Area of [[Turku cathedral]] in autumn.]]
Situated by the [[Baltic Sea]] and sheltered by the islands of the [[Archipelago Sea]], Turku has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with [[temperature]]s ranging up to 30&amp;nbsp;°C (86&amp;nbsp;°F), and relatively cold winters with frequent [[snow]]fall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of {{convert|17.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}, whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is {{convert|5.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] in Turku averages {{convert|720|mm|1|abbr=on}} a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average {{convert|80|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only {{convert|32|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The average [[air pressure]] at sea level is {{convert|101.2|kPa|inHg}}, with little variance throughout the year.

Operational since 1955, the city's [[weather station]] is located at an altitude of {{convert|47|m|ft|abbr=off}} at [[Turku Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;'Turku' at EuroWeather&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:Turku Vappu 2008.jpg|thumb|People celebrating [[Vappu]] in central Turku]]
At the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the [[districts of Finland|economic districts]] of Turku and Åboland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?contentid=97662&amp;nodeid=4907&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 |title=www.turku.fi » turku.fi » Turku.info » Publications and Reports |publisher=turku.fi |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716095845/https://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?contentid=97662&amp;nodeid=4907&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 |archive-date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their [[native language]], while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are [[Russian language|Russian]] (1.6%), [[Arabic]] (1.4%), [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] (1%), [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (0.8%), [[Estonian language|Estonian]] (0.8%) and [[Somali language|Somali]] (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are [[Finnish nationality law|Finnish citizens]], and the most sizeable minorities are from [[Russia]], [[Estonia]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Albania]], [[Sweden]], [[Somalia]], [[China]], and [[Denmark]]. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Turun kaupungin tilastollinen vuosikirja, 2005/2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Oasis of the Seas 2009-10-18.jpg|thumb|right|[[MS Oasis of the Seas]], formerly the world's largest passenger ship, was built in Turku.]]

The business district in the city's economy is centred on the [[Port of Turku]] and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned [[high tech]] centre – the [[Turku Science Park]] area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} from the fields of [[biotechnology]] and [[information technology]], as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the ''Turku Strategy'' that is published annually by the city council. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
At least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: [[HKScan]] and [[Hesburger]]. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include [[Bayer]], [[Fläkt Woods]], [[Meyer Werft]], [[Orion Corporation]] and [[Wärtsilä]].

{{As of|2015|June}}, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unemployment rate at 10%, every fifth young person without work|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/unemployment_rate_at_10_every_fifth_young_person_without_work/8171703|website=YLE|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Culture of Finland|Cultural venues]] in Turku include several [[theatre]]s, [[movie theater|cinemas]], and [[art gallery|art galleries]], and a [[Turku Philharmonic Orchestra|city philharmonic orchestra]]. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the [[Medieval Market of Turku|Medieval Market]] in July each year. Turku is also the official [[Christmas]] city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The [[Turku music festival]] and the [[rock festival]] [[Ruisrock]] (held on the island of [[Ruissalo]]) are among the oldest of its kind in [[Scandinavia]]. The city also hosts another rock festival, [[Down by the Laituri]], and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uudenmusiikinfestivaali.org/ |title=www.uudenmusiikinfestivaali.org |publisher=www.uudenmusiikinfestivaali.org |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, &quot;New Music Festival&quot;), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.

There are also numerous [[museum]]s, such as the Turku Art Museum and the [[Wäinö Aaltonen Museum of Art]]. The Åbo Akademi University maintains the [[Sibelius Museum]], which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the [[Turku Castle]], which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the ''[[Aboa Vetus]]'' museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century [[Archaeology|archaeological]] site. The ''[[Luostarinmäki]]'' [[handicraft]]s museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the [[Great Fire of Turku]] in 1827, was the first [[Scandinavia]]n venue to receive the &quot;Golden Apple&quot; tourism award.

Considered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the [[Turku Cathedral]] has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the [[Aura River (Finland)|Aura River]]. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable [[Bishop of Turku|bishops]] and captains of war as well as one [[Queen of Sweden]], [[Catherine Månsdotter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.visitturku.fi/en/guiding-turku-cathedral-groups-110394 Guiding in Turku Cathedral (for groups) – Visit Turku]&lt;/ref&gt;

Turku is [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.

The [[Declaration of Christmas Peace]] has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the [[Winter War]]. The declaration takes place on the [[Old Great Square (Turku)|Old Great Square of Turku]], Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn ''Jumala ompi linnamme'' ([[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott]]'') and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a [[parchment]] roll in Finnish and Swedish.

==Sports==
[[File:Paavo Nurmi Marathon, 2007, Aurakatu.jpg|thumb|[[Paavo Nurmi Marathon (Turku)|Paavo Nurmi Marathon]] is run every summer.]]

The city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the ''[[Veikkausliiga]]'': [[FC Inter Turku|FC Inter]] and [[Turun Palloseura|TPS]]. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at [[Veritas Stadion]] in the district of [[Kupittaa]].

[[HC TPS]] of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, [[SM-liiga]]. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009–2010. [[Gatorade Center]], formerly named ''HK Arena'', located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.

The ''[[Paavo Nurmi Marathon (Turku)|Paavo Nurmi Marathon]]'' is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner [[Paavo Nurmi]], who was born and raised in the city.

==Government and politics==
[[File:Turun hovioikeus.jpg|thumb|The Court of Appeal and Academy House of Turku]]

Being both a [[regions of Finland|regional]] and [[provinces of Finland|provincial]] capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the [[Archdiocese of Turku|Archbishop of Finland]] and a [[Appellate court|Court of Appeal]]. [[Aleksi Randell]] has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.

The [[city council]] of Turku has 67 seats.

For a city of its size, Turku has a moderate [[public transport]] network of [[bus]] routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized [[Tampere]]. The bus network is managed and supervised by the ''Turku City Region’s Public Transport Committee'' (FÖLI) ({{lang-fi|Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta}}, {{lang-sv|kollektivtrafiknämnden för Åbo stadsregion}}), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by FÖLI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foli.fi/fi/tietoja-ja-ohjeita/joukkoliikennetietoa |title=Joukkoliikennetietoa |accessdate=2016-01-14 |publisher=Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta |language=fi |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110115933/http://www.foli.fi/fi/tietoja-ja-ohjeita/joukkoliikennetietoa |archive-date=2016-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, [[VR (Finnish railway company)|VR]]. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the [[Turku Central railway station]] in [[Pohjola, Turku|Pohjola]], and two smaller stations in [[Kupittaa]] and the [[Port of Turku]].

There is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular [[tram]] services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} However, there are plans for a [[light rail]] system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosmäki, as well as the neighbouring cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raitio.org/historia/pika/pika.htm |title=Raitiovaunulla Naantaliin, Kaarinaan, Runosmäkeen, Varissuolle? |accessdate=2008-07-11 |last=Laaksonen |first=Mikko |work=raitio.org |publisher=Finnish Tramways Society |language=fi |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901225302/http://www.raitio.org/historia/pika/pika.htm |archive-date=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Finland has announced plans to support [[Espoo]] with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kotimaa/?ts=1,3:1002:0:0,4:2:0:1:2006-09-27,104:2:407945,1:0:0:0:0:0 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070630122159/http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kotimaa/?ts=1,3:1002:0:0,4:2:0:1:2006-09-27,104:2:407945,1:0:0:0:0:0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-06-30 |title=Turun Sanomat |publisher=Turunsanomat.fi |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2009-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.

Turku's most significant highways for traffic are [[Finnish national road 1|Highway 1]] leading to [[Helsinki]]; [[Finnish national road 10|Highway 10]] leading to [[Hämeenlinna]]; [[Finnish national road 9|Highway 9]] leading to [[Tampere]], [[Jyväskylä]], [[Kuopio]] and [[Joensuu]]; [[Finnish national road 8|Highway 8]] leading to [[Pori]], [[Vaasa]] and [[Oulu]]; and the [[Turku Ring Road]], which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.

[[Turku Airport]] is located {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of [[Rusko]]. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including [[airBaltic]] and [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS Scandinavian]], and one cargo airline.

There are also daily ferry services from the [[Port of Turku]] to Sweden and the [[Åland Islands]], operated by [[Silja Line]] and [[Viking Line]]. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see [[ruotsinlaiva]]), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a [[cruising (maritime)|cruise]] across the Gulf of Bothnia.

The [[Archipelago Sea]] boat traffic is handled by, among others, [[SS Ukkopekka]], an old [[steamship]] that cruises on the route Turku-[[Naantali]]-Turku.

Turku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: [[Turku Central Station|Turku Central]], [[Port of Turku]], and [[Kupittaa railway station|Kupittaa]].

==Education==
[[File:Turun yliopisto.jpg|thumb|right|The main building of the [[University of Turku]]]]

Turku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city – the first school in the city, the [[Katedralskolan i Åbo|Cathedral School]], was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first [[university]] in Finland, the &quot;[[Royal Academy of Turku]]&quot; (now [[University of Helsinki]]), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the [[Bell-Lancaster method]] was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.

Turku is home to about 35,000 higher education students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=4904&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 |title=www.turku.fi » turku.fi » Turku.info » Turku in Brief |publisher=turku.fi |accessdate=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716095212/https://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=4904&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 |archive-date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two universities and several &quot;[[University of applied sciences (Finland)|polytechnics]]&quot; in the town.

The Finnish [[University of Turku]] is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. [[Åbo Akademi]], founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is one of Finland's  two Swedish-language universities. [[Turku School of Economics]] merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and Åbo handelshögskola, its Swedish counterpart, with Åbo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, [[Turku University Hospital]], is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.

[[Turku University of Applied Sciences]] is the second largest [[Institute of technology#Finland|polytechnic]] in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also [[Novia University of Applied Sciences]] and [[Diaconia University of Applied Sciences]] have campuses in the town.

Turku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established [[international school]] (the other city being Helsinki). [[Turku International School]], located in the eastern district of [[Varissuo]], has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the [[University of Turku]], [[Turun normaalikoulu]] takes care of the teaching in the international school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tnk.utu.fi/index.php?id=1389&amp;news_id=125&amp;archive=|title= Turku International School|publisher= [[University of Turku]]|date= 15 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
[[File:Turun kaupunginkirjaston päärakennus.jpg|thumb|Main library of Turku]]

===Vowel harmony===
[[File:Finnish vowel harmony Venn diagram.svg|thumb|A diagram illustrating the vowel groups in Finnish.]]
Finnish, like many other [[Uralic languages]], has the phenomenon called [[vowel harmony]], which restricts the cooccurrence in a word of vowels belonging to different articulatory subgroups. Vowels within a word &quot;harmonize&quot; to be either all front or all back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|van der Hulst|van de Weijer|1995|p=498}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, no native noncompound word can contain vowels from the group {''a'', ''o'', ''u''} together with vowels from the group {''ä'', ''ö'', ''y''}. Vowel harmony affects inflectional [[Affix|suffixes]] and derivational suffixes, which have two forms, one for use with back vowels, and the other with front vowels. Compare, for example, the following pair of abstract nouns: ''hallit'''u'''s'' 'government' (from ''hallita'', 'to reign') versus ''terve'''y'''s'' 'health' (from ''terve'', healthy).

There are exceptions to the constraint of vowel harmony. For one, there are two front vowels that lack back counterparts: {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}. Therefore, words like ''kello'' 'clock' (with a front vowel in a nonfinal syllable) and ''tuuli'' 'wind' (with a front vowel in the final syllable), which contain {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/e/}} together with a back vowel, count as back vowel words; {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} are effectively neutral in regard to vowel harmony in such words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|van der Hulst|van de Weijer|1995|pp=498–499}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kello'' and ''tuuli'' yield the inflectional forms ''kelloss'''a''''' 'in a clock' and ''tuuless'''a''''' 'in a wind'. In words containing only neutral vowels, front vowel harmony is used, e.g. ''tie'' – ''tiell'''ä''''' ('road' – 'on the road'). For another, compound words do not have vowel harmony across the compound boundary;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hellstrom|1976|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. ''seinäkello'' 'wall clock' (from ''seinä'', 'wall' and ''kello'', 'clock') has back {{IPA|/o/}} cooccurring with front {{IPA|/æ/}}. In the case of compound words, the choice between back and front suffix alternants is determined by the immediately-preceding element of the compound; e.g. 'in a wall clock' is ''seinäkelloss'''a''''', not ''seinäkelloss'''ä'''''.

A particular exception appears in a standard Finnish word, ''tällainen'' ('this kind of'). Although by definition a singular word, it was originally a compound word that transitioned over time to a more compact and easier form: {{lang|fi|tämänlajinen}} (from {{lang|fi|tämän}}, 'of this' and {{lang|fi|lajinen}}, 'kind') → {{lang|fi|tänlainen}} → {{lang|fi|tällainen}}, and further to {{lang|fi|tällä(i)nen}} for some non-standard speech.

New loan words may exhibit vowel disharmony; for example, ''olympialaiset'' ('Olympic games') and ''sekundäärinen'' ('secondary') have both front and back vowels. In standard Finnish, these words are pronounced as they are spelled, but many speakers apply vowel harmony – ''ol'''u'''mpialaiset'', and ''sekund'''aa'''rinen'' or ''sek'''y'''ndäärinen''.

* For most speakers, {{IPAslink|t}} is dental {{IPAblink|t̪}}, whereas {{IPAslink|n}} and {{IPAslink|d}} are alveolar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Suomi|Toivanen|Ylitalo|2008|pp=27, 28–29, 33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/d/}} may sometimes be closer to a [[flap consonant|flap]] or tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}} than a true plosive {{IPAblink|d}}, and the dialectal realization varies widely; it is increasingly common to pronounce it as a true plosive, however. See the [[#Voiced plosives|section below]]. In native vocabulary it is the equivalent of {{IPAslink|t}} under weakening [[consonant gradation]], and thus it occurs only word-medially, either by itself (e.g. ''sade'' 'rain'; cf. ''sataa'' 'to rain') or in the cluster {{IPA|/hd/}} (e.g. ''lähde'' 'fountain, spring, source'; cf. ''lähteä'' 'to depart'). In recent loanwords and technical vocabulary the sound can occur somewhat freely (e.g. ''[[wiktionary:addiktio|addiktio]]'', ''[[wiktionary:adverbi#Finnish|adverbi]]'', ''[[wiktionary:anekdootti|anekdootti]]'', ''[[wiktionary:bulevardi|bulevardi]]'', ''[[wiktionary:demoni#Finnish|demoni]]'', ''[[wiktionary:formaldehydi|formaldehydi]]'', ''[[wiktionary:sandaali|sandaali]]''), likewise in slang vocabulary (e.g. ''[[wiktionary:dorka|dorka]]'' 'idiot', ''[[wiktionary:kondis|kondis]]'' 'condition').
* {{IPAslink|s}} is frequently retracted alveolar {{IPAblink|s̠}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Suomi|Toivanen|Ylitalo|2008|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[glottal stop]] can appear at certain morpheme boundaries, the same ones as the gemination described [[Finnish phonology#Sandhi|further down]] as a result of certain sandhi phenomena, and it is not normally indicated in spelling at the end of a word: e.g. {{IPA|[ɑnnɑʔːollɑ]}} 'let it be', orthographically ''anna olla''. Moreover, this sound is not used in all dialects. However, word-internally, it can be indicated by an apostrophe, which can occur when a ''k'' is lost between similar vowels, e.g. ''vaaka'' 'scales' → ''vaa'an'' 'scales (gen.sg.)'.
* The velar nasal {{IPAslink|ŋ}} is also heavily limited in occurrence in native vocabulary: it is found only word-medially, either in the consonant cluster {{IPA|/ŋk/}} (written ''nk''), or as geminate {{IPA|/ŋŋ/}} (written ''ng''), the latter being the counterpart of the former under [[consonant gradation]] (type of [[lenition]]). In recent loanwords {{IPA|/ŋ/}} may also occur in other environments; e.g. ''magneetti'' {{IPA|/mɑŋneetti/}}, ''pingviini'' {{IPA|/piŋʋiini/}}.
*{{IPAblink|ʋ}} &quot;is often accompanied by a somewhat ballistic lower-lip gesture, producing something like a [[labiodental flap]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''York Papers in Linguistics'', no. 17 (1996), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;
{{IPAblink|f}} appears in native words only in the Southwestern dialects, but is reliably distinguished by Finnish speakers. Other foreign fricatives are not. ''š'' or ''sh'' {{IPAblink|ʃ}} appears only in non-native words, sometimes pronounced {{IPAblink|s}}, although most speakers make a distinction between e.g. ''šakki'' 'chess' and ''sakki'' 'a gang (of people)'.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The orthography also includes the letters ''z'' and ''ž'', although their use is marginal, and they have no phonemic status. For example, ''[[wiktionary:azeri#Finnish|azeri]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:džonkki|džonkki]]'' may be pronounced {{IPA|[ɑseri]}} and {{IPA|[tsoŋkki]}} without fear of confusion. The letter ''z'', found mostly in foreign words and names such as [[Zulu (disambiguation)|Zulu]], may also be pronounced as {{IPAblink|t͡s}} following the influence of [[German language|German]], thus ''Zulu'' {{IPA|/t͡sulu/}}.
*The phoneme {{IPAslink|h}} has glottal and fricative allophones. In general, at the end of a syllable it is pronounced as a fricative whose place of articulation is similar to the preceding vowel: [[velar consonant|velar]] {{IPAblink|x}} after a back vowel ({{IPA|/a o u/}}), [[palatal consonant|palatal]] {{IPAblink|ç}} after a high front vowel ({{IPA|/i y/}}). Between vowels a breathy or [[Murmured voice|murmured]] {{IPAslink|ɦ}} can occur:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Suomi|Toivanen|Ylitalo|2008|pp=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** {{lang|fi|vihma}} {{IPA|[ˈʋiçmɑ]}}, {{lang|fi|lyhty}} {{IPA|[ˈlyçty]}}
** {{lang|fi|mahti}} {{IPA|[ˈmɑxti]}}, {{lang|fi|kohme}} {{IPA|[ˈkoxme]}}, {{lang|fi|tuhka}} {{IPA|[ˈtuxkɑ]}}
** {{lang|fi|maha}} {{IPA|[ˈmɑɦɑ]}}

===Voiced plosives===
{{Details|Finnish orthography#Voiced plosives}}
Traditionally, {{IPAslink|b}} and {{IPAslink|ɡ}} were not counted as Finnish phonemes, since they appear only in loanwords. However, these borrowings being relatively common, they are nowadays considered part of the educated norm. The failure to use them correctly is often ridiculed in the media,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} e.g. if a news reporter or a high official consistently and publicly realises ''Belgia'' ('Belgium') as ''Pelkia''. Even many educated speakers, however, still make no distinction between voiced and voiceless plosives in regular speech if there is no fear of confusion.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011|reason=Personal experience disagrees}} Minimal pairs do exist: {{IPA|/bussi/}} 'a bus' vs. {{IPA|/pussi/}} 'a bag', {{IPA|/ɡorillɑ/}} 'a gorilla' vs. {{IPA|/korillɑ/}} 'on a basket'.

The status of {{IPAslink|d}} is somewhat different from {{IPAslink|b}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, since it also appears in native Finnish words, as a regular 'weak' correspondence of the voiceless {{IPAslink|t}} (see Consonant gradation below). Historically, this sound was a fricative, {{IPAblink|ð}} (''th'' as in English ''the''), varyingly spelled as ''d'' or ''dh'' in Old Literary Finnish. Its realization as a plosive originated as a [[spelling pronunciation]], in part because when mass elementary education was instituted in Finland, the spelling ''d'' in Finnish texts was mispronounced as a plosive, under the influence of how Swedish speakers would pronounce this letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Campbell|2004|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In the close to seven centuries during which Finland was under first Swedish, then Russian rule, Swedish speakers dominated the government and economy.) Initially, few native speakers of Finnish acquired the foreign plosive realisation of the native phoneme. As for loanwords, {{IPA|/d/}} was often assimilated to {{IPA|/t/}}. Even well into the 20th century it was not entirely exceptional to hear loanwords like ''deodorantti'' ('a deodorant') pronounced as ''teotorantti'', while native Finnish words with a {{IPA|/d/}} were pronounced in the usual dialectal way. Due to diffusion of the standard language through mass media and basic education, and due to the dialectal prestige of the capital area, the plosive {{IPA|[d]}} can now be heard in all parts of the country, at least in loanwords and in formal speech.

===Consonant gradation===
{{main|Finnish consonant gradation}}
&quot;Consonant gradation&quot; is the term used for a set of alternations which pervade the language, between a &quot;strong grade&quot; and a &quot;weak grade&quot;. These alternations are always conditioned by both phonology and morphosyntax. The phonological factor which triggers the weak grade is the syllable structure of closed syllable. However, there are contexts where weak grade fails to occur in a closed syllable, and there are contexts where the weak grade occurs in an open syllable. Morphosyntactically, the weak grade occurs in nominals (nouns, pronouns, adjectives) usually only before case suffixes, and in verbs usually only before person agreement suffixes.

The following is a general list of strong–weak correspondences.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Strong !! Weak
|-
| {{IPA|/pp, tt, kk/}} || {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}
|-
| {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} || {{IPA|/ʋ, d, ∅~j~ʋ/}}
|-
| {{IPA|/mp, nt, ŋk/}} || {{IPA|/mm, nn, ŋŋ/}}
|-
| {{IPA|/lt, rt/}} || {{IPA|/ll, rr/}}
|}

===Other consonant alternations===
Many of the remaining &quot;irregular&quot; patterns of Finnish noun and verb inflection are explained by a change of a historical {{IPA|*ti}} to {{IPA|/si/}}. The change from {{IPA|*ti}} to {{IPA|/si/}}, a type of [[assibilation]], is unconnected to consonant gradation, and dates back as early as [[Proto-Finnic language|Proto-Finnic]]. In modern Finnish the alternation is not productive, due to new cases of the sequence {{IPA|/ti/}} having been introduced by later sound changes and loanwords, and assibilation therefore occurs only in certain morphologically defined positions.

Words having this particular [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] are still subject to consonant gradation in forms that lack assibilation. Finnish words may thus have two, and sometimes three stems: a word such as ''vesi'' 'water (sg. nom.)' may produce ''veden'' (sg. gen.), ''vetenä'' (sg. ess.),  ''vesissä'' (pl. iness.); because the change from ''t'' to ''s'' has only occurred in front of ''i''. When a vowel other than ''i'' occurs, words like ''vesi'' inflect just like other nouns with a single ''t'' alternating with the consonant gradated ''d''.

This pattern has, however, been reverted in some cases. Variation appears in particular in past tense verb forms, e.g. ''kieltää'', ''kielsi'' ('to deny', 'denied') but ''säätää'', ''sääti'' ('to adjust', 'adjusted'). Both alternate forms ({{lang|fi|kielti}} and {{lang|fi|sääsi}}) can also be found in dialects. Apparently this was caused by word pairs such as {{lang|fi|noutaa}}, {{lang|fi|nouti}} ('bring') and ''nousta'', ''nousi'' ('rise'), which were felt important enough to keep them contrastive.

Assibilation occurred prior to the change of the original consonants cluster {{IPA|*kt}} to {{IPA|/ht/}}, which can be seen in the inflection of the numerals ''yksi'', ''kaksi'' and ''yhden'', ''kahden''.

In many recent loanwords, there is vacillation between representing an original voiceless consonant as single or geminate: this is the case for example ''kalsium'' (~ ''kalssium'') and ''kantarelli'' (~ ''kanttarelli''). The orthography generally favors the single form, if it exists. (More completely assimilated loans such as ''farssi'', ''minuutti'', ''ooppera'' generally have settled on geminates.)

==Length==
All phonemes (including {{IPA|/ʋ/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}, see below) can occur doubled phonemically as a phonetic increase in length. Consonant doubling always occurs at the boundary of a syllable in accordance with the rules of Finnish syllable structure.

Some example sets of words:
: ''tuli'' 'fire'/'s/he came', ''tuuli'' 'wind', ''tulli'' 'customs'
: ''muta'' 'mud', ''muuta'' 'other' (partitive sg.), ''mutta'' 'but', ''muuttaa'' 'to change' or 'to move'

A double {{IPA|/h/}} is rare in standard Finnish, but possible, e.g. ''hihhuli'', a derogatory term for a religious fanatic. In some dialects, e.g. Savo, it is common: {{lang|fi|rahhoo}}, or standard Finnish {{lang|fi|rahaa}} 'money' (in the partitive case). The distinction between {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/dd/}} is found only in foreign words; natively 'd' occurs only in the short form. While {{IPA|/ʋ/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} may appear as geminates when spoken (e.g. ''vauva'' {{IPA|[ʋɑuʋːɑ]}}, ''raijata'' {{IPA|[rɑijːɑtɑ]}}), this distinction is not phonemic, and is not indicated in spelling.

In dialects or in [[colloquial Finnish]], {{IPA|/ʋ/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/j/}} can have distinctive length, especially due to [[sandhi]] or [[compensatory lengthening]], e.g. ''sevverran'' (''sen verran''), ''kuvvoo'' (''kuvaa''), ''teijjän'' (''teidän''), ''Kajjaani'' (''Kajaani'').

==Phonotactics==
The phonemic template of a syllable in Finnish is CVC, in which C can be an [[obstruent]] or a [[liquid consonant]]. V can be realized as a doubled vowel or a [[diphthong]]. A final consonant of a Finnish word, though not a syllable, must be a [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] one.

Originally Finnish syllables could not start with two consonants but many loans containing these have added this to the inventory. This is observable in older loans such as ''ranska'' &lt; Swedish ''franska'' ('French') contrasting newer loans ''presidentti'' &lt; Swedish ''president'' ('president'). In past decades, it was common to hear these clusters simplified in speech ({{lang|fi|resitentti}}), particularly, though not exclusively, by either rural Finns or Finns who knew little or no Swedish or English. Even then, the Southwestern dialects formed an exception: consonant clusters, especially those with plosives, trills or nasals, are common: examples include place names ''Friitala'' and ''Preiviiki'' near the town [[Pori]], or town ''Kristiinankaupunki'' ('[[Kristinestad]]'). Nowadays the overwhelming majority of Finns have adopted initial consonant clusters in their speech.

===Consonant phonotactics===
Consonant phonotactics are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sulkala|Karjalainen|1992|pp=369–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Word-final consonants'''
* Only {{IPA|/t, s, n, r, l/}}.
* Glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} occurs almost exclusively at word boundaries, replacing what used to be word-final consonants {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/h/}}.

'''Word-initial consonants'''
* Only {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} cannot occur word initially (except {{IPA|/d/}} in loan words).

'''Word-initial consonant clusters'''
* Only stop+liquid combinations are allowed, which is a result of the influence of mostly post-WWII loanwords (e.g. {{IPA|/klinikkɑ/}} = 'clinic', {{IPA|/plɑneettɑ/}} = 'planet').

'''Word-final consonant clusters'''
* None, except in dialects via vowel dropping.

'''Word-medial consonant clusters'''
* The following clusters are not possible in Finnish:
** any exceeding 3 consonants (except in loan words)
** stop + nasal
** labial stop + non-labial stop
** non-dental stop + semivowel
** nasal + non-homorganic obstruent (except {{IPA|/nh/}})
** nasal + sonorant
** liquid + liquid
** semivowel + consonant

===Vowel phonotactics===
Vowel phonotactics are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sulkala|Karjalainen|1992|pp=372–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Word-final and word-initial vowels'''
* Any of the vowels can be found in this position.

'''Vowel sequences'''
* Doubled vowels
** Usually only the vowels {{IPA|/ɑ, æ, i, y, u/}} are doubled.
** Sometimes the mid vowels {{IPA|/e, o, ø/}} can be doubled in cases of contraction.
* Diphthongs
** Of the 18 diphthongs, 14 are formed from any vowel followed by a close vowel. The 3 exceptions are {{IPA|/uo, yø, ie/}}.
* Vowel combinations
** Approximately 20 combinations, always at syllable boundaries.
** Unlike diphthongs, the second vowel is longer, as is expected, and it can be open {{IPA|/ɑ/}} or {{IPA|/æ/}}.
** Sometimes 3–4 vowels can occur in a sequence if a medial consonant has disappeared.

==Prosody==

===Stress===
[[lexical stress|Stress]] in Finnish is non-phonemic. Like [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], Finnish always places the primary stress on the first [[syllable]] of a word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Iivonen|Harnud|2005|pp=59, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary stress normally falls on odd-numbered syllables. Contrary to primary stress, Finnish secondary stress is quantity sensitive.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Thus, if secondary stress would normally fall on a light (CV.) syllable but this is followed by a heavy syllable (CVV. or CVC.), the secondary stress moves one syllable further  (&quot;to the right&quot;) and the preceding foot (syllable group) therefore contains three syllables. Thus, ''omenanani'' (&quot;as my apple&quot;) contains light syllables only and has primary stress on the first syllable and secondary on the third, as expected: ''ómenànani''. On the other hand, ''omenanamme'' ('as our apple') has a light third syllable (''na'') and a heavy fourth syllable (''nam''), so secondary stress falls on the fourth syllable: ''ómenanàmme''.

Certain Finnish dialects also have quantity-sensitive main stress pattern, but instead of moving the initial stress, they geminate the consonant, so that e.g. light-heavy CV.CVV becomes heavy-heavy CVCCVV, e.g. the partitive form of &quot;fish&quot; is pronounced ''kalaa'' in the quantity-insensitive dialects but ''kallaa'' in the quantity-sensitive ones (cf. also the examples under the &quot;Length&quot; section).

Secondary stress falls on the first syllable of non-initial parts of compounds, for example the compound ''puunaama'', meaning &quot;wooden face&quot; (from ''puu'', 'tree' and ''naama'', 'face'), is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈpuːˌnɑː.mɑ]}} but ''puunaama'', meaning &quot;which was cleaned&quot; (preceded by an agent in the genitive, &quot;by someone&quot;), is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈpuː.nɑː.mɑ]}}.

===Timing===
Finnish is not really [[isochrony|isochronic]] at any level. For example, ''huutelu'' ('shouting') and ''huuhtelu'' ('flushing') are distinct words, where the initial syllables ''huu-'' and ''huuh-'' are of different length. Additionally, acoustic measurements show that the first syllable of a word is longer in duration than other syllables, in addition to its phonological doubling. Thus, there are four distinct phonetic lengths.

==Sandhi==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Finnish grammar]] --&gt;

Finnish [[sandhi]] is extremely frequent, appearing between many words and morphemes, in formal standard language and in everyday spoken language. In most registers, it is never written down; only dialectal transcriptions preserve it, the rest settling for a [[Morpheme|morphemic]] notation. There are two processes. The first is simple [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] with respect to place of articulation (e.g. ''np'' &gt; ''mp''). The second is predictive [[gemination]] of initial consonants on morpheme boundaries.

Simple phonetic incomplete assimilations include:
* {{IPA|/n + k/ → /ŋk/}}, [[velarization]] due to 'k', e.g. ''sen kanssa'' {{IPA|/seŋ kɑnssɑ/}}
* {{IPA|/n + p/ → /mp/}}, [[labialization]] due to 'p' e.g. ''menenpä'' {{IPA|/menempæ/}}
* {{IPA|/[[Vowel|V]] + [[Vowel|V]]/ → [VʔV]}}, [[dissimilation]] of a sequence of individual vowels (compared to diphthongs) by adding a [[glottal stop]], e.g. kuorma-auto {{IPA|[kuo̯rmɑʔɑu̯to]}} (not obligatory)

[[Gemination]] of a morpheme-initial consonant occurs when the morpheme preceding it ends in a vowel and belongs to one of certain morphological classes. Gemination or a tendency of a morpheme to cause gemination is sometimes indicated with an apostrophe or a superscripted &quot;x&quot;, e.g. ''vene'' {{IPA|/ʋeneˣ/}}. Examples of gemination:
* most nouns ending in ''-e'' (apart from some new loanwords),&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson_aeaenne_muoto204&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karlsson |first1=Fred |title=Suomen kielen äänne- ja muotorakenne |date=1982 |publisher=WSOY1 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically those with the singular partitive ending in ''-tta/-ttä''
:: e.g. ''hakelava'' {{IPA|[hɑkelːɑʋɑ]}} ('open-box bed for wood chips')
* imperatives and connegative imperatives of the second-person singular, as well as the connegative form of the present indicative (these three are always similar to each other)
:: e.g. ''osta vene'' {{IPA|[ostɑʋːene]}} ('buy a boat') &lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson_aeaenne_muoto349&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karlsson |first1=Fred |title=Suomen kielen äänne- ja muotorakenne |date=1982 |publisher=WSOY1 |page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* connegative imperatives of the third-person singular, first-person plural, second-person plural and third-person plural.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson_aeaenne_muoto349&quot; /&gt;
:: ''älkää '''tehkö'''kään sitä'' {{IPA|[tehkøkːæːn]}} ('actually, don't do it')
* connegative forms of present potential verbs
:: ''en '''tehne'''kään sitä'' {{IPA|[tehnekːæːn]}} ('I probably will not do it (after all)', formal or poetic speech)
* first infinitives (the dictionary form)
:: e.g. ''täytyy mennä käymään'' {{IPA|[tæy̯tyːmenːækːæy̯mæːn]}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson_aeaenne_muoto349&quot; /&gt;
* noun cases in ''-e'': allative ''-lle'' as well as the more marginal sublative ''-nne'' (as in ''tänne'') and prolative ''-tse'' (as in ''postitse''); not the comitative, though&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson_aeaenne_muoto349&quot; /&gt;
* adverbs ending in ''-sti'', ''-lti''&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson_aeaenne_muoto349&quot; /&gt; and ''-ti'' &lt;ref name=&quot;Collinder1941_153&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collinder |first1=Björn |title=Lärobok i finska språket för krigsmakten |date=1941 |publisher=Ivar Häggström |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the possessive suffix of the third person ''-nsa''/''-nsä''&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson_aeaenne_muoto349&quot; /&gt;
* some other words such as ''luo'' ('to, towards [a person or place]'), ''kiinni'', ''ala'', ''taa'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Collinder1941_7&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collinder |first1=Björn |title=Lärobok i finska språket för krigsmakten |date=1941 |publisher=Ivar Häggström |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''kai'' 'probably',  ''tai'' 'or', (only for some speakers) ''itse'' 'self'

The gemination can occur between morphemes of a single word as in {{IPA|/minulle/}} + {{IPA|/kin/}} → {{IPA|[minulːekːin]}} ('to me too'; orthographically ''minullekin''), between parts of a compound word as in {{IPA|/perhe/}} + {{IPA|/pɑlɑʋeri/}} → {{IPA|[perhepːɑlɑʋeri]}} ('family meeting'; orthographically ''perhepalaveri''), or between separate words as in {{IPA|/tule/}} + {{IPA|/tænne/}} → {{IPA|[tuletːænːe]}} ('come here!'). In elaborate standard language, the gemination affects even morphemes with a vowel beginning: {{IPA|/otɑ/}} + {{IPA|/omenɑ/}} → {{IPA|[otɑʔːomenɑ]}} or {{IPA|[otɑʔomenɑ]}} ('take an apple!'). In casual speech, this is however often rendered as {{IPA|[otɑomenɑ]}} without a glottal stop.

These rules are generally valid for the standard language, although many Southwestern dialects, for instance, do not recognise the phenomenon at all. Even in the standard language there is idiolectal variation (disagreement between different speakers); e.g. whether ''kolme'' ('three') should cause a gemination of the following initial consonant or not: {{IPA|[kolmeʋɑristɑ]}} or {{IPA|[kolmeʋːɑristɑ]}} ('three crows'). Both forms occur and neither one of them is standardised, since in any case it does not affect writing. In some dictionaries compiled for foreigners or linguists, however, the tendency of geminating the following consonant is marked by a superscript ''x'' as in ''perhe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;''.

Historically, morpheme-boundary gemination is the result of regressive assimilation. The preceding word originally ended in {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/k/}}. For instance, the modern Finnish word for 'boat' ''vene'' used to be ''veneh'' (a form still existing in the closely related [[Karelian language]]). At some point in time, these {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}s were assimilated by the initial consonant of a following word, e.g. {{lang|fi|veneh kulkevi}}' ('the boat is moving'). Here we get the modern Finnish form {{IPA|[ʋenekːulkeː]}} (orthographically {{lang|fi|vene kulkee}}), even though the independent form {{IPA|[ʋene]}} has no sign of the old final consonant {{IPA|/h/}}.

In many Finnish dialects, including that of Helsinki, the gemination at morpheme boundaries has become more widespread due to the loss of additional final consonants, which appear only as gemination of the following consonant, cf. [[Liaison (French)|French liaison]]. For example, the standard word for 'now' ''nyt'' has lost its ''t'' and become ''ny'' in Helsinki speech. However, {{IPA|/ny/}} + {{IPA|/se/}} ('now it [does something]') is pronounced {{IPA|[nysːe]}} and not {{IPA|*[nyse]}} (although the latter would be permissible in the dialect of Turku).

Similar remnants of a lost word-final {{IPA|/n/}} can be seen in dialects, where e.g. the genitive form of the first singular pronoun is regularly {{IPA|/mu/}} (standard language ''minun''): {{IPA|/se/}} + {{IPA|/on/}} + {{IPA|/mu/}} → {{IPA|[seomːu]}} ('it is mine'). Preceding an approximant, the {{IPA|/n/}} is completely assimilated: {{IPA|[muʋːɑi̯mo]}} ('my wife'). Preceding a vowel, however, the {{IPA|/n/}} however appears in a different form: {{IPA|/mu/}} + {{IPA|/omɑ/}} → {{IPA|[munomɑ]}} or even {{IPA|[munːomɑ]}} ('my own').

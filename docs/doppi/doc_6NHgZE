An alternative network configuration to virtual calls is [[connectionless communication]] using [[datagram|datagrams]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tanenbaum&quot; /&gt;

==Layer 4 virtual circuits==
Connection oriented [[transport layer]] protocols such as [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]&lt;ref&gt;RFC 793&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rfc1180&quot;&gt;RFC 1180&lt;/ref&gt; may rely on a connectionless packet switching network layer protocol such as [[Internet Protocol|IP]], where different packets may be routed over different paths, and thus be delivered out of order. However, it is possible to use TCP as a virtual circuit,&lt;ref name=&quot;rfc1180&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RFC 955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RFC 1644&lt;/ref&gt; since TCP includes segment numbering that allows reordering on the receiver side to accommodate out-of-order delivery.

==Layer 2/3 virtual circuits==
[[Datalink layer]] and [[network layer]] virtual circuit protocols are based on connection-oriented [[packet switching]], meaning that data is always delivered along the same network path, i.e., through the same nodes. Advantages with this over connectionless packet switching are: 
* Bandwidth reservation during the connection establishment phase is supported, making guaranteed [[Quality of Service]] (QoS) possible. For example, a [[constant bit rate]] QoS class may be provided, resulting in emulation of [[circuit switching]]. 
* Less overhead is required since the packets are not routed individually and complete addressing information is not provided in the header of each data packet. Only a small [[virtual channel identifier]] (VCI) is required in each packet. Routing information is only transferred to the network nodes during the connection establishment phase.
* The network nodes are faster and have higher capacity in theory since they are switches that only perform routing during the connection establishment phase, while connectionless network nodes are routers that perform routing for each packet individually. Switching only involves looking up the virtual channel identifier in a table rather than analyzing a complete address. Switches can easily be implemented in [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] hardware, while routing is more complex and requires software implementation. However, because of the large market of IP routers, and because advanced IP routers support [[layer 3 switching]], modern IP routers may today be faster than switches for connection-oriented protocols.

==Examples of protocols that provide virtual circuits==
Examples of transport layer protocols that provide a virtual circuit:
* [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), where a reliable virtual circuit is established on top of the underlying unreliable and connectionless IP protocol. The virtual circuit is identified by the source and destination [[network socket]] address pair, i.e. the sender and receiver IP address and port number. Guaranteed QoS is not provided.
* [[Stream Control Transmission Protocol]] (SCTP), where a virtual circuit is established on top of the IP protocol.
Examples of network layer and datalink layer virtual circuit protocols, where data always is delivered over the same path:
* [[X.25]], where the VC is identified by a [[virtual channel identifier]] (VCI). X.25 provides reliable node-to-node communication and guaranteed QoS.
* [[Frame relay]], where the VC is identified by a DLCI. Frame relay is unreliable, but may provide guaranteed QoS.
* [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM), where the circuit is identified by a [[virtual path identifier]] (VPI) and [[virtual channel identifier]] (VCI) pair. The [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode#Reference model|ATM layer]] provides unreliable virtual circuits, but the ATM protocol provides for reliability through the [[ATM adaptation layer]] (AAL) Service Specific Convergence Sublayer (SSCS) (though it uses the terms &quot;assured&quot; and &quot;non-assured&quot; rather than &quot;reliable&quot; and &quot;unreliable&quot;).&lt;ref name = &quot;I.363.3&quot;&gt;ITU-T, ''B-ISDN ATM Adaptation Layer specification: Type 3/4 AAL'', Recommendation I.363.3 (08/96), International Telecommunication Union, 1996, p5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;I.363.5&quot;&gt;ITU-T, ''B-ISDN ATM Adaptation Layer specification: Type 5 AAL'', Recommendation I.363.5 (08/96), International Telecommunication Union, 1996, p5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS)
* [[Multiprotocol label switching]] (MPLS), which can be used for IP over virtual circuits. Each circuit is identified by a label. MPLS is unreliable but provides eight different QoS classes.

==Permanent and switched virtual circuits in ATM, frame relay, and X.25==
'''Switched virtual circuits''' ('''SVCs''') are generally set up on a per-[[telephone call|call]]  basis and are disconnected when the call is terminated; however, a  '''permanent virtual circuit''' ('''PVC''') can be established as an option to provide a [[dedicated circuit]] [[data link|link]] between two facilities.  PVC configuration is usually preconfigured by the service provider.  Unlike SVCs, PVC are usually very seldom broken/disconnected.

A switched virtual circuit (SVC) is a virtual circuit that is dynamically established on demand and is torn down when transmission is complete, for example after a phone call or a file download. SVCs are used in situations where data transmission is sporadic and/or not always between the same data terminal equipment ([[Data terminal equipment|DTE]]) endpoints.

A permanent virtual circuit (PVC) is a virtual circuit established for repeated/continuous use between the same [[Data terminal equipment|DTE]]. In a PVC, the long-term association is identical to the data transfer phase of a [[virtual call]]. Permanent virtual circuits eliminate the need for repeated call set-up and [[Clearing (telecommunications)|clearing]].

* [[Frame relay]] is typically used to provide PVCs.
* [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] provides both '''switched virtual connections''' and '''permanent virtual connections''', as they are called in ATM terminology.
* [[X.25]] provides both '''virtual calls''' and PVCs, although not all X.25 service providers or DTE implementations support PVCs as their use was much less common than SVCs

In [[Open system (computing)|open systems]], a '''virtual terminal''' ('''VT''') is an [[application service]] that:

# Allows [[Server (computing)|host]] terminals on a multi-[[User (computing)|user]] [[computer network|network]] to interact with other hosts regardless of [[computer terminal|terminal]] type and characteristics,
# Allows remote log-on by local area network managers for the purpose of management,
# Allows users to access [[information]] from another host [[central processing unit|processor]] for transaction processing,
# Serves as a backup facility.

[[PuTTY]] is an example of a virtual terminal.

[[ITU-T]] defines a virtual terminal protocol based on the [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI]] [[application layer]] protocols. However, the virtual terminal protocol is not widely used on the Internet.

A '''voice frequency''' ('''VF''') or '''voice band''' is the range of [[Audio frequency|audio frequencies]] used for the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[speech]].

== Frequency band ==
In [[telephony]], the usable [[human voice|voice]] frequency band ranges from approximately 300 to 3400&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-039/_5829.htm{{fv|reason=This sources says 4k|date=August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that the [[ultra low frequency]] band of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] between 300 and 3000&amp;nbsp;Hz is also referred to as ''voice frequency'', being the electromagnetic energy that represents acoustic energy at [[baseband]]. The [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] allocated for a single [[Voice channel|voice-frequency transmission channel]] is usually 4&amp;nbsp;kHz, including [[guard band]]s, allowing a [[sampling rate]] of 8&amp;nbsp;kHz to be used as the basis of the [[pulse code modulation]] system used for the digital [[PSTN]]. Per the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]], the sampling frequency (8&amp;nbsp;kHz) must be at least twice the highest component of the voice frequency via appropriate filtering prior to sampling at discrete times (4&amp;nbsp;kHz) for effective reconstruction of the voice signal.

== Fundamental frequency ==
The [[Human voice|voiced speech]] of a typical adult male will have a [[fundamental frequency]] from 85 to 180&amp;nbsp;Hz, and that of a typical adult female from 165 to 255&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall (currently published by NCVS.org) (pp. 188), {{ISBN|978-0-13-717893-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baken, R. J. (1987). Clinical Measurement of Speech and Voice. London: Taylor and Francis Ltd. (pp. 177), {{ISBN|1-5659-3869-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the fundamental frequency of most speech falls below the bottom of the voice frequency band as defined above. However, enough of the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] will be present for the [[missing fundamental]] to create the impression of hearing the fundamental tone.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''voice frequency primary patch bay''' (VF) is a patching facility that provides the first appearance of local-[[User (telecommunications)|user]] VF circuits in the [[technical control facility]] (TCF).  

The VF primary [[patch bay]] provides patching, [http://wiktionary.org/wiki/Transwiki:Monitoring monitoring], and testing for all VF circuits. Signals will have various levels and [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]] schemes depending on the user [[terminal equipment]].

      <text bytes="3150" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunications]], a '''voice operated switch''', also known as '''VOX''' or '''voice-operated exchange''', is a switch that operates when sound over a certain threshold is detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Newton's Telecom Dictionary |url=https://archive.org/details/newtonstelecomdi00harr |url-access=registration |last=Newton |first=Harry |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=CMP books |location= |isbn= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newtonstelecomdi00harr/page/901 901] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually used to turn on a transmitter or recorder when someone speaks and turn it off when they stop speaking. It is used instead of a [[push-to-talk operation|push-to-talk button]] on transmitters or to save storage space on recording devices. On [[mobile telephone|cell phones]], it is used to save [[battery (electricity)|battery]] life. Intercom systems that use a speaker in a room as both a speaker and a microphone will often use VOX on the main console to switch the audio direction during a conversation. The circuit usually includes a delay between the sound stopping and switching direction, to avoid the circuit turning off during short pauses in speech.

A special case exists, if there is enough energy to power the system directly. For example, a microphone may send a voltage, high enough, to directly operate a transmitter. &lt;ref&gt;http://g3xbm-qrp.blogspot.com/2009/10/sound-powered-transmitters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with push-to-talk ==
Unlike manual [[push-to-talk]] (PTT) operation, VOX is
automatic; the user can keep his or her hands free while talking. But VOX also has some significant disadvantages that explain why PTT is still common.

Most VOX circuits have a sensitivity adjustment, but unwanted (and sometimes undetected) VOX triggering can still occur on background noise, heavy breathing or a side conversation. Conversely, it may not activate when desired on speech that is too weak.

The VOX in a two-way radio can also be triggered by the loudspeaker carrying the other side of the conversation. This problem can be
minimized with an &quot;anti vox&quot; feature to decrease VOX sensitivity when the receiver is active.

Transmitters and recorders have short but finite activation times that
may clip the beginnings of phrases. Some modern VOX circuits eliminate this problem by recording or transmitting a delayed version of the input signal. An older way of overcoming this, used by pilots, and astronauts, as some of the first users of VOX, was to habitually preface every transmission with &quot;uh&quot; in place of keying the microphone. 

VOX uses a &quot;hang&quot; timer, typically 1-3 seconds, to remain engaged during brief speech pauses. This means the last several seconds of each transmission or recorded segment are always silence. A VOX-activated recorder can delete the end of each segment but the user of a VOX-activated half duplex radio must wait for the timer to expire before he or she can receive again.

== History ==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
{{see also|List of silicon producers}}

In the 1950s, [[Mohamed Atalla]] investigated the surface properties of silicon [[semiconductors]] at [[Bell Labs]], where he adopted a new method of [[semiconductor device fabrication]], coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of [[silicon oxide]], so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below, overcoming the [[surface states]] that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer. This is known as [[surface passivation]], a method that later became critical to the [[semiconductor industry]] as it made possible the mass-production of silicon [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs).&lt;ref name=&quot;atalla&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Atalla in Inventors Hall of Fame, 2009|url=https://www.invent.org/inductees/martin-john-m-atalla|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kahng&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Dawon Kahng |url=https://www.invent.org/inductees/dawon-kahng |website=[[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=27 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lojek&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lojek |first1=Bo |title=History of Semiconductor Engineering |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=9783540342588 |pages=321–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface passivation method was presented by Atalla in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lojek |first1=Bo |title=History of Semiconductor Engineering |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=9783540342588 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later the basis for the [[metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (MOS) process invented by Atalla and [[Dawon Kahng]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;atalla&quot;/&gt;

By 1960, silicon wafers were being manufactured in the U.S. by companies such as [[MEMC Electronic Materials|MEMC]]/[[SunEdison]]. In 1965, American engineers Eric O. Ernst, Donald J. Hurd, and Gerard Seeley, while working under [[IBM]], filed Patent US3423629A&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US3424629A/en|title=High capacity epitaxial apparatus and method|author=|date=|website=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first high-capacity [[epitaxy|epitaxial]] apparatus.

Silicon wafers are made by companies such as [[Sumco]] and [[Shin-Etsu Chemical]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tel.com/museum/magazine/material/150430_report04_03/02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; One process for forming crystalline wafers is known as [[Czochralski process|Czochralski growth]] invented by the Polish chemist [[Jan Czochralski]]. In this process, a cylindrical [[ingot]] of high purity monocrystalline semiconductor, such as silicon or [[germanium]], called a [[Boule (crystal)|boule]], is formed by pulling a [[seed crystal]] from a [[Zone melting|melt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Microelectronic Materials and Processes |last=Levy |first=Roland Albert |year=1989 |pages=1–2 |isbn=978-0-7923-0154-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZPRPU6ne7UC&amp;pg=PA248 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grover/&gt; Donor impurity atoms, such as [[boron]] or [[phosphorus]] in the case of silicon, can be added to the molten [[Intrinsic semiconductor|intrinsic]] material in precise amounts in order to [[Doping (semiconductor)|dope]] the crystal, thus changing it into an [[extrinsic semiconductor]] of [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] or [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]].

The boule is then [[wikt:sliced|sliced]] with a wafer saw (a type of [[wire saw]]) and [[polishing|polished]] to form wafers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nishi |first=Yoshio |year=2000|title=Handbook of Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology |pages=67–71 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-8783-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qi98H-iTgLEC&amp;q=wafer+flat+and+notch&amp;pg=PA70 |accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of wafers for photovoltaics is 100–200&amp;nbsp;mm square and the thickness is 100–500&amp;nbsp;μm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/design-of-silicon-cells/silicon-solar-cell-parameters |title=Silicon Solar Cell Parameters |access-date=2019-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronics use wafer sizes from 100–450&amp;nbsp;mm diameter.

== Cleaning, texturing and etching ==

Wafers are cleaned with [[weak acid]]s to remove unwanted particles, or repair damage caused during the sawing process. There are several standard cleaning procedures to make sure the surface of a silicon wafer contains no contamination. One of the most effective methods is [[RCA clean]].
When used for [[solar cell]]s, the wafers are textured to create a rough surface to increase their efficiency. The generated PSG ([[phosphosilicate glass]]) is removed from the edge of the wafer in the [[etching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.omron-semi-pv.eu/en/wafer-based-pv/front-end/wet-process.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204143516/http://www.omron-semi-pv.eu/en/wafer-based-pv/front-end/wet-process.html |archive-date=2009-02-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicon wafers are available in a variety of diameters from 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm (1&amp;nbsp;inch) to 300&amp;nbsp;mm (11.8&amp;nbsp;inches).&lt;ref name=f450c&gt;{{Cite web|title = Evolution Of Silicon Wafer {{!}} F450C|url = http://www.f450c.org/infographic/|website = F450C|accessdate = 2015-12-17|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Silicon Wafer |url=http://www.semiwafer.com/products/silicon.htm |accessdate=2008-02-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220102757/http://www.semiwafer.com/products/silicon.htm |archivedate=2008-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Semiconductor fabrication plant]]s, colloquially known as ''fabs'', are defined by the diameter of wafers that they are tooled to produce.

===Deorbit disposal===
[[Salyut 1]], the world's first space station, was deliberately de-orbited into the Pacific Ocean in 1971 following the [[Soyuz 11]] accident. Its successor, [[Salyut 6]], was de-orbited in a controlled manner as well.

On June 4, 2000 the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] was deliberately de-orbited after one of its gyroscopes failed. The debris that did not burn up fell harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean. The observatory was still operational, but the failure of another gyroscope would have made de-orbiting much more difficult and dangerous. With some controversy, NASA decided in the interest of public safety that a controlled crash was preferable to letting the craft come down at random.

In 2001, the Russian ''[[Mir]]'' space station was deliberately de-orbited, and broke apart in the fashion expected by the command center during atmospheric reentry. Mir entered the Earth's atmosphere on March 23, 2001, near [[Nadi]], [[Fiji]], and fell into the South Pacific Ocean.

On February 21, 2008, a disabled U.S. [[spy satellite]], [[USA-193]], was hit at an altitude of approximately {{convert|246|km|sp=us}} with an [[SM-3]] missile fired from the U.S. Navy [[cruiser]] {{USS|Lake Erie|CG-70|2}} off the coast of [[Hawaii]]. The satellite was inoperative, having failed to reach its intended orbit when it was launched in 2006. Due to its rapidly deteriorating orbit it was destined for uncontrolled reentry within a month. [[U.S. Department of Defense]] expressed concern that the {{convert|1000|lb|adj=on}} fuel tank containing highly toxic [[hydrazine]] might survive reentry to reach the Earth's surface intact. Several governments including those of Russia, China, and [[Belarus]] protested the action as a thinly-veiled demonstration of US anti-satellite capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Gray |title= U.S. has high confidence it hit satellite fuel tank |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1930844420080222 |agency=Reuters |date=2008-02-21 |access-date=2008-02-23| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080225204300/https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1930844420080222| archive-date= 25 February 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; China had previously caused an international incident when it [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|tested an anti-satellite missile]] in 2007.

'''Saint Rosalia''' (1130–1166), also called '''La Santuzza''' or &quot;''The Little Saint''&quot;, and in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] as &quot;'''Rusulia'''&quot;, is the [[patron saint]] of [[Palermo]] in Italy, [[Santa Rosalía de Camargo, Chihuahua|Camargo]], Chihuahua, and three towns in [[Venezuela]]: [[El Hatillo Municipality|El Hatillo]], [[Zuata]], and [[Anzoátegui]]. She is especially important internationally as a saint invoked in times of [[plague (disease)]]. In 2020, she is being invoked by the citizens of Palermo to protect the city from [[COVID-19]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/palermo-pins-hopes-patron-saint-rosalia-rid-italy-coronavirus|title=Palermo pins hopes on patron saint to rid Italy of coronavirus|first=Lorenzo|last=Tondo|date=13 March 2020|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

[[File:Saint Rosalia statue (Monterey, California).jpg|120px|left|thumb|A statue of Saint Rosalia in [[Monterey, California]]]]
 
Rosalia was born of a [[Normans|Norman]] noble family that claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]]. Devoutly religious, she retired to live as a [[hermit]] in a cave on [[Mount Pellegrino]], where she died alone in 1166. Tradition says that she was led to the cave by two [[angels]]. On the cave wall she wrote ''&quot;I, Rosalia, daughter of Sinibald, Lord of Roses, and Quisquina, have taken the resolution to live in this cave for the love of my Lord, Jesus Christ.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;catholic&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=157 |title=St. Rosalia |website=Catholic Online |language=en |access-date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1624 plague ==
In 1624, a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] beset Palermo. During this hardship Saint Rosalia appeared first to a sick woman, then to a hunter, to whom she indicated where her remains were to be found. She ordered him to bring her bones to Palermo and have them carried in procession through the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.italianfolkmagic.com/blog/2017/8/26/santa-rosalia|title=Santa Rosalia|date= 4 September 2017|accessdate=14 July 2018|publisher=Italian Folk Magic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hunter climbed the mountain and found her bones in the cave as described. He did what she had asked in the apparition. After her remains were carried around the city three times, the plague ceased. After this Saint Rosalia was venerated as the patron saint of Palermo, and a sanctuary was built in the cave where her remains were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;For the great expansion of Rosalia's popular cult in Italy as a result of the 1624 plague, see [[Franco Mormando]], &quot;Response to the Plague in Early Modern Italy: What the Primary Sources, Printed and Painted, Reveal&quot; in ''Hope and Healing: Painting in Italy in a Time of Plague, 1500–1800'', ed. G. Bailey, P. Jones, F. Mormando, and T. Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts: The Worcester Art Museum,2005, pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her post-1624 iconography is dominated by the work of the Flemish painter [[Anthony van Dyck]], who was trapped in the city during the 1624–1625 quarantine, during which time he produced five paintings of the saint, now in [[Saint Rosalia (Anthony van Dyck)|Madrid]], [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (Houston)|Houston]], [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (London)|London]], [[Saint Rosalie Interceding for the Plague–Stricken of Palermo|New York]] and [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (Palermo)|Palermo itself]]. In 1629 he also produced ''[[Saint Rosalia Interceding for the City of Palermo]]'' and ''[[Coronation of Saint Rosalia]]'' to assist Jesuit efforts to spread her cult beyond Sicily.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

== Controversy about the bones ==

In 1825, geologist William Buckland was in Palermo during his honey moon and asked to see the bones of the saint. After an examination of the relics the geologist determined them to be &quot;non-human&quot;, in fact he declared the relic was actually the bones of a goat.

According to Buckland, priests said that the saint would not let him see her remains because he was not a catholic christian, and locked the relics away from people's eyes.[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/221/4611/636]

== In art ==

Saint Rosalia was an important subject in Italian Renaissance and Baroque painting, particularly in sacre conversazioni (group pictures of saints flanking the Virgin Mary) by artists such as [[Riccardo Quartararo]], [[Mario di Laurito]], [[Vincenzo La Barbara]], and possibly [[Antonello da Messina]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gauvin Alexander Bailey]], &quot;Anthony van Dyck, the Cult of Saint Rosalie, and the 1624 Plague in Palermo,&quot; in Gauvin Alexander Bailey et al., Hope and Healing: Painting in Italy in a Time of Plague (Worcester and Chicago, 2005): 118–36.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was Flemish master [[Anthony Van Dyck]] (1599–1637), who was caught in Palermo during the 1624 plague, who produced the most paintings of her (see also above). His depictions {{ndash}} a young woman with flowing blonde hair, wearing a Franciscan cowl and reaching down toward the city of Palermo in its peril {{ndash}} became the standard iconography of the saint from that time onward. Van Dyck's series of St. Rosalia paintings have been studied by [[Gauvin Alexander Bailey]] and [[Xavier F. Salomon]], both of whom curated or co-curated exhibitions devoted to the theme of Italian art and the plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/29/arts/design/desperately-painting-the-plague.html|title=Desperately Painting the Plague|first=Holland|last=Cotter|date=29 July 2005|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;issn=00036536&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA284449813&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;linkaccess=abs|title=Van Dyck in Sicily: while the plague held Palermo in its grip, Anthony van Dyck radically developed 12th-century iconography of Saint Rosalie through five paintings that imbued the saint with a sensual refinement.

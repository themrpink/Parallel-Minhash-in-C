      <text bytes="5641" xml:space="preserve">{{One source|date=May 2019}}{{Advert|date=May 2019}}'''Visual DialogScript''' (VDS) is an [[Interpreted language|interpreted]] [[programming language]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It can be used to create small, fast programs. VDS has a large number of dialog and graphical elements available to create professional looking programs. VDS programs have access to the [[Windows API]]; therefore, it is possible to write applications that can perform the same advanced tasks as other programming languages such as [[Visual Basic]], [[C++]], or [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]].

==Language==
Unlike other programming languages, the syntax of VDS is very simple&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19980125155047/http://www.jm-tech.com/vdstour.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Each command occupies one line, and has a plain English name that clearly describes its purpose. Variables are typeless, and can hold many kinds of information, for example, numbers or text. Functions are clearly distinguishable with names that start with '[[At sign|@]]', just like a spreadsheet.

The DialogScript language has a simple syntax not unlike MS-DOS batch language. It is designed for ease of use and efficiency when being interpreted by the run-time engine. There are 10 system variables, %0 to %9, which initially have the script file name in %0 and command line parameters in %1 through %9, just as in a batch file. There are also a further 26 user variables, %A to %Z. The contents of all variables (including system ones) can be changed once the script is running. There are now also 4032 global variables. These variables begin with %%, a letter, then alphanumerics plus underscores (e.g. %%my_variable_1.) There is no limit on the length of these user-defined variable names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dialogscript.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=129 Visual DialogScript - Overview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax Examples==
'''Comments:'''
* &lt;code&gt;# This is a single line comment&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;REM This is a single line comment&lt;/code&gt;

'''Simple Information Message Box:'''
*&lt;code&gt;info &quot;This is the information text&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

'''Simple Warning Message Box:'''
*&lt;code&gt;warn &quot;This is the warning text&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

'''Create a custom dialog box:'''
*&lt;code&gt;dialog create,&amp;lt;name&gt;,&amp;lt;top pixel position&gt;,&amp;lt;left pixel position&gt;,&amp;lt;width in pixels&gt;,&amp;lt;height in pixels&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

'''Write to the Windows Registry:'''
*&lt;code&gt;registry write,&amp;lt;root key&gt;,&amp;lt;key&gt;,&amp;lt;subkey&gt;,&amp;lt;data&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

'''Display an input prompt dialog box, storing the result in the variable %A:'''
*&lt;code&gt;%A = @input(&quot;Please enter a value:&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

==History==
Visual DialogScript was created by Julian Moss (1953 – October 24, 2014&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/software/tribute-julian-moss-1953-2014-3582730/&lt;/ref&gt;) of JM-Tech/Tech-Pro Ltd. In 1998, after version 3.0, Emmanuel Daunizeau of S.A.D.E. sarl, took over the ownership and development of VDS, modifying and improving its syntax. Currently, VDS is marketed by the British company Commercial Research Ltd. and is still the property of Emmanuel Daunizeau who continues to develop it.

Several versions of VDS have been released over time:
* Visual DialogScript 2.0
* Visual DialogScript 2.5
* Visual DialogScript 3.0
* Visual DialogScript 3.5
* Visual DialogScript 4
* Visual DialogScript 4.5
* Visual DialogScript 5
* Visual DialogScript 5.01
* Visual DialogScript 5.02
* Visual DialogScript 6

==Currently Available Versions==
There are several versions available for download:
# '''Personal Visual DialogScript (PVDS) 4:''' This freeware version is intended for students and home PC users. The package includes a short tutorial and full online help which includes many example scripts. The software is not licensable for commercial use. This version is incapable of producing compiled executable files; however, compiling files is not necessary, as a script file can be executed directly by opening it from [[Windows Explorer]] on any system that has PVDS installed on it.
# '''Visual DialogScript 2.5 (16-Bit Edition):''' This version marked the last release for Windows 3.1+ (16-bit).
# '''Visual DialogScript 5:''' This version is for power users, business users, and professional developers who use&amp;mdash;or are developing scripts for&amp;mdash;Windows 95/98/ME or Windows NT/2000/XP. This version can create compiled executable files, and includes a royalty-free run-time license (once registered). Additional features include an icon editor and support for many add-on extensions. As a 32-bit program, it supports long filenames, task bar tray icons, unlimited length strings and string lists and the Windows Registry. This legacy version is now available for download for registered users and is not available for purchase.
# '''Visual DialogScript 6:''' The newest version of Visual DialogScript improves upon Visual DialogScript 5 and adds full support for [[Windows Vista]]. Additionally, the registered version can now create standalone compiled executable files that do not require an external runtime file.

'''Mazara del Vallo''' ({{IPA-it|madˈdzaːra del ˈvallo}}; {{Lang-scn|Mazzara}})  is a town and ''[[comune]]'' in the [[province of Trapani]], southwestern [[Sicily]], [[Italy]]. It lies mainly on the left bank at the mouth of the [[Mazaro]] river.

It is an [[agricultural]] and [[fishing]] centre and its [[harbor|port]] gives shelter to the largest fishing fleet in Italy.

== History ==
=== Ancient town ===
Mazara was founded by the [[Phoenicia]]ns in the 9th century BC, with the name of ''Mazar'' (the ''Rock''). It then passed under the control of [[Greece|Greeks]], [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], [[Roman empire|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Byzantine empire|Byzantines]], before being [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|occupied]] by the [[Arabs]] in the year 827 AD. During the [[Emirate of Sicily|Arab period]], Sicily was divided into [[Three valli of Sicily|three different administrative regions]], ''[[Val di Noto]]'', ''[[Val Demone]]'' and ''[[Val di Mazara]]'', making the city an important commercial harbour and centre of learning. The city centre, known as the ''[[Kasbah]]'', retains Arab architectural influences.

In 1072, Mazara was conquered by [[Normans]], headed by [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]]. During that period, in 1093, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mazara del Vallo]] was instituted.

After the death of Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], Sicily passed to the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]], then followed by the [[Spaniard]]s of [[Aragon]]. The Aragon period (1282–1409) is characterized by a political, economic and demographic decline of Mazara. The city passed under the control of the [[House of Savoy]] in 1713, a reign which lasted only five years, being replaced by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] (for 16 years) followed by the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]]. In 1860 the city was finally conquered by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and the [[I Mille|Mille]], thus joining the then newly formed [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]].

The city was known as ''Mazzara del Vallo'' until the [[World War II]] period, following which the spelling was changed to ''Mazara del Vallo''.

=== Today ===
Today Mazara is widely considered to be one of the most important fishing centres of Italy; tussles about fishing rights, especially with the North-African countries, figure large in the town's recent history, boat sequestrations being a common event. Currently the fishing business in the city seems to be withering, mainly because of the increasing lack of people willing to work on boats.

Mazara del Vallo is among the Italian cities with the highest percentages of [[immigrant]]s; it is estimated that the city hosts at least 3,500 registered immigrants, mainly from nearby [[Tunisia]] but also the other countries of the [[Maghreb]]. They tend to live principally around the old Arab city centre (the ''Casbah''). There exists a local school, managed by the [[Tunisia]]n government, at which only [[Arabic]] and [[French language|French]] are taught as languages. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}This has led to some controversy. Most of the local schools show openness to Arab culture, even providing Arabic language classes for both Italians and Arabs, and encouraging integration with the autochthonous students.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The local [[city council]] also provides a seat reserved for a representative of Mazara's immigrant community.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Geography==
Mazara borders with the municipalities of [[Campobello di Mazara]], [[Castelvetrano]], [[Marsala]], [[Petrosino]], and [[Salemi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|39318|Mazara del Vallo}}&lt;/ref&gt; It counts the hamlets (''[[Frazione|frazioni]]'') of Borgata Costiera and Mazara Due.

==Main sights==
[[File:Arco Normanno, Mazara.jpg|left|thumb|Norman Arc]]
Mazara made national news in March 1998, when a bronze statue called the ''[[Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo|Dancing Satyr]]'' (''Satiro Danzante'') was found off the port, at a depth of {{convert|500|m|ft}} in the [[Strait of Sicily]] by a local fishing boat. The statue is believed to have been sculpted by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] artist [[Praxiteles]] and is now on display to the public in a dedicated museum in the city, after having been on show at the [[Chamber of Deputies]] of [[Rome]], and in [[Aichi]], [[Japan]]. After this event, the city quickly gained in terms of visiting tourists and a national advertising campaign was mounted with the slogan ''Mazara del Satiro''.

Other attractions include the ''Norman Arc'', that is the remains of the old Norman Castle built in 1073 and demolished in 1880, and a number of churches, including the Royal Saint Nicholas (''San Nicolò Regale'') Church, a rare example of Norman architecture built in 1124, the Seminary, built in 1710, which surrounds the main local [[piazza]], ''Piazza della Repubblica'', and St. Vitus on the Sea (''San Vito a Mare'') Church. In honour of St. [[Vitus]], the official patronal saint as well as a native of Mazara del Vallo, the St. Vitus Feast (''Lu Fistinu di Santu Vitu'') is held every year.

== Transportation ==
Mazara del Vallo is connected to the rest of Sicily by a regional [[train]] service (run by [[Trenitalia]]), a private bus service (only to Palermo), and by car, via the [[Autostrada A29 (Italy)|A29 highway]] (also known as ''[[Palermo]]-Mazara del Vallo''). It is reachable from [[Trapani-Birgi Airport]] by an infrequent bus service or by taxi (€20 per person) and from [[Palermo International Airport|Palermo]] by car or taxi.

During the summer period, Mazara is also connected via [[ferry]] to the island of [[Pantelleria]] and [[Hammamet, Tunisia|Hammamet]], in Tunisia.

== History ==
=== Ancient times and early Middle Ages ===
People have lived in and around what is now Asti since the [[Neolithic]] period. Before their defeat in 174 BC by the Romans, tribes of [[Ligures]], the [[Statielli]], dominated the area and the [[toponym]] probably derives from ''Ast'' which means &quot;hill&quot; in the ancient [[Celtic language]].

In 124 BC the Romans built a ''[[castrum]]'', or fortified camp, which eventually evolved into a full city named Hasta. In
89 BC the city received the status of ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'', and in 49 BC that of ''[[municipium]]''. Asti become an important city of the Augustan [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Regio IX]], favoured by its strategic position on the Tanaro river and on the [[Via Fulvia]], which linked Derthona ([[Tortona]]) to Augusta Taurinorum ([[Turin]]). Other roads connected the city to the main passes for what are today [[Switzerland]] and [[France]].

The city was crucial during the early stages of the barbarian invasions which stormed Italy during the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. In early 402 AD the [[Visigoths]] had invaded northern Italy and were advancing on [[Mediolanum]] (modern [[Milan]]) which was the imperial capital at that time. [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], the young emperor and a resident in that city, unable to wait for promised reinforcements any longer, was compelled to flee from Milan for safety in the city of [[Arles]] in [[Gaul]]. However, just after his convoy had left Milan and crossed the [[River Po]] his escape route through the [[Alps]] was cut off by the Gothic cavalry. This forced him to take emergency refuge in the city of Hasta until more Roman troops could be assembled in Italy. The Goths placed Hasta under siege until March when General [[Stilicho]], bringing reinforcements from the [[Rhine]], fought and defeated them at the [[Battle of Pollentia]]. After this first victorious defence, thanks to a massive line of walls, Hasta suffered from the barbarian invasions which stormed Italy after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], and declined economically.

In the second half of the 6th century it was chosen as seat for one of the 36 Duchies in which the [[Lombards]] divided Italy. The territory of Asti comprised a wide area, stretching out to [[Albenga]] and the [[Maritime Alps]]. This remained when northern Italy was conquered by the [[Franks]] in 774, with the title of County.

In the late Carolingian age Asti was ruled directly by his bishops, who were the main landlords of the area. Most important are Audax (904-926) and Bruningus (937-966), who moved the episcopal seat to the Castel Vecchio (&quot;Old Castle&quot;), where it remained until 1409. The [[bishopric of Asti]] remained a powerful entity well into the 11th century, when Pietro II received huge privileges by emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]]. In the second half of the century, Bishop Otto tried to resist the aims of the powerful countess [[Adelaide of Susa]], who damaged the city several times. During Otto's reign, a [[medieval commune|commune]] and the [[consul]] magistrates are mentioned for the first time (1095) and make this City-State the first republic of Europe.

=== Local power ===

Asti was one of the first [[Medieval commune|free communes]] of Italy, and in 1140 received the right to mint coins of its own by [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Empire|Conrad II]]. As the commune, however, had begun to erode the lands of the bishop and other local faudataries, the latter sued for help to [[Frederick Barbarossa]], who presented under the [[Asti City Walls|city walls]] with a huge army in February 1155. After a short siege, Asti was stormed and burnt. Subsequently, Asti adhered to the [[Lombard League]] (1169) against the German emperor, but was again defeated in 1174. Despite this, after the [[Peace of Constance]] (1183), the city gained further privileges.

The 13th century saw the peak of the Astigiani economic and cultural splendour, only momentarily hindered by wars against [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]], [[Alessandria]], [[Savoy]], [[Milan]] (which besieged the city in 1230) and the [[Marquess of Montferrat|Marquesses of Montferrat]] and [[Saluzzo]]. In particular, the commune aimed to gain control over the lucrative trade routes leading northwards from the Ligurian ports. In this period, the rise of the [[Casane Astigiane]] resulted in contrasting political familial alliances of [[Guelph and Ghibelline]] supporters. During the wars led by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in northern Italy, the city chose his side: Asti was defeated by the Guelphs of Alessandria at Quattordio and Clamandrana, but thanks to [[Genoa|Genoese]] help, it recovered easily. After Frederick's death, the struggle against [[Thomas II of Savoy]] became fierce: the Astigiani defeated him on February 23, 1255, at the [[Battle of Montebruno]], but Thomas (who had been taken prisoner) replied ordering all traders from Asti to be arrested in [[Savoy]] and [[France]]. This move showed worry on the part of Asti's neighbouring states over the excessive power gained by the city, which had captured Alba and controlled both [[Chieri]] and Turin.

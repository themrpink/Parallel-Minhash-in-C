In [[fiber optic]] technology, a '''reference surface''' is that surface of an [[optical fiber]] that is used to contact the transverse-alignment elements of a [[electronic component|component]] such as a [[electrical connector|connector]] or [[mechanical splice]].  For telecommunications-grade fibers, the reference surface is the outer surface of the [[Cladding (fiber optics)|cladding]]. For plastic-clad [[silica]] (PCS) fibers, which have a strippable polymer cladding (not to be confused with the polymer overcoat of an [[all-silica fiber]]), the reference surface may be the [[Fiber_optics#Principle_of_operation|core]].

{{For|intensity ratios|Reflectance}}
In [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]] the '''reflection coefficient''' is a parameter that describes how much of a wave is reflected by an impedance discontinuity in the transmission medium.  It is equal to the ratio of the [[amplitude]] of the reflected wave to the incident wave, with each expressed as [[phasor]]s.  For example, it is used in [[optics]] to calculate the amount of light that is reflected from a surface with a different index of refraction, such as a glass surface, or in an electrical [[transmission line]] to calculate how much of the [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|electromagnetic wave]] is reflected by an impedance. The reflection coefficient is closely related to the ''[[transmission coefficient]]''. The [[reflectance]] of a system is also sometimes called a &quot;reflection coefficient&quot;.

[[Image:Partial transmittance.gif|right|frame|A wave experiences partial transmittance and partial reflectance when the medium through which it travels suddenly changes.  The reflection coefficient determines the ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude.]]

Different specialties have different applications for the term.

== Transmission lines ==
{{see also|Reflections of signals on conducting lines|Signal reflection}}

In [[telecommunication]]s and [[transmission line]] theory, the reflection coefficient is the [[ratio]] of the [[complex amplitude]] of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave.  The voltage and current at any point along a transmission line can always be resolved into forward and reflected traveling waves given a specified reference impedance ''Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. The reference impedance used is typically the [[characteristic impedance]] of a transmission line that's involved, but one can speak of reflection coefficient without  any actual transmission line being present. In terms of the forward and reflected waves determined by the voltage and current, the reflection coefficient is defined as the [[complex number|complex]] ratio of the voltage of the reflected wave (&lt;math&gt;V^-&lt;/math&gt;) to that of the incident wave (&lt;math&gt;V^+&lt;/math&gt;). This is typically represented with a &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; (capital [[gamma]]) and can be written as: 

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{V^-}{V^+} &lt;/math&gt;

It can as well be defined using the ''currents'' associated with the reflected and forward waves, but introducing a minus sign to account for the opposite orientations of the two currents:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = -\frac{I^-}{I^+}  = \frac{V^-}{V^+} &lt;/math&gt;

The reflection coefficient may also be established using other field or [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] pairs of quantities whose product defines power resolvable into a forward and reverse wave. For instance, with electromagnetic plane waves, one uses the ratio of the electric fields of the reflected to that of the forward wave (or magnetic fields, again with a minus sign); the ratio of each wave's electric field ''E'' to its magnetic field ''H'' is again an impedance  ''Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' (equal to the [[impedance of free space]] in a vacuum). Similarly in [[acoustics]] one uses the acoustic pressure and velocity respectively.

[[Image:Reflection Coefficient Circuit.svg|thumb|right|Simple circuit configuration showing measurement location of reflection coefficient.]]
In the accompanying figure, a signal source with internal impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_S\,&lt;/math&gt; possibly followed by a transmission line of characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_S\,&lt;/math&gt; is represented by its [[Thévenin equivalent]], driving the load &lt;math&gt;Z_L&lt;/math&gt;. For a real (resistive) source impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_S&lt;/math&gt;, if we define &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; using the reference impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;Z_S\,&lt;/math&gt; then the source's [[Impedance matching#Reflection-less matching|maximum power is delivered]] to a load &lt;math&gt;Z_L&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt;, in which case &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=0&lt;/math&gt; implying no reflected power. More generally, the squared-magnitude of the reflection coefficient &lt;math&gt;|\Gamma|^2&lt;/math&gt;  denotes the proportion of that power that is &quot;reflected&quot; and absorbed by the source, with the power actually delivered to the load thus reduced by &lt;math&gt;1-|\Gamma|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Anywhere along an intervening (lossless) transmission line of characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt;, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient &lt;math&gt;|\Gamma|&lt;/math&gt; will remain the same (the powers of the forward and reflected waves stay the same) but with a different phase. In the case of a short circuited load (&lt;math&gt;Z_L=0&lt;/math&gt;), one finds &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=-1&lt;/math&gt; at the load. This implies the reflected wave having a 180° phase shift (phase reversal) with the voltages of the two waves being opposite at that point and adding to zero (as a short circuit demands).

=== Relation to load impedance ===
The reflection coefficient corresponds directly to a specific impedance as seen at the point it is measured. A load impedance of &lt;math&gt;Z_L&lt;/math&gt; (using a reference impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0\,&lt;/math&gt;) corresponds to a reflection coefficient of

:&lt;math&gt;  \Gamma ={Z_L-Z_0  \over Z_L+Z_0} &lt;/math&gt; .

If that load, &lt;math&gt;Z_L&lt;/math&gt;, were measured not directly but through a transmission line, then the ''magnitude'' of the reflection coefficient is identical (as are the powers in the forward and reflected waves). However its ''phase'' will have shifted according to 

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma' =\Gamma e^{-i \, 2 \phi}  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical length#Phase_length|electrical length]] (expressed as phase) of that length of transmission line at the frequency considered. Note that the phase of the reflection coefficient is changed by ''twice'' the phase length of the attached transmission line. That is to take into account not only the phase delay of the reflected wave, but the phase shift that had first been applied to the forward wave, with the reflection coefficient being the quotient of these. The reflection coefficient so measured,  &lt;math&gt;\Gamma'&lt;/math&gt;, corresponds to an impedance which is generally dissimilar to &lt;math&gt;Z_L&lt;/math&gt; present at the far side of the transmission line. 

The complex reflection coefficient (in the region &lt;math&gt;| \Gamma| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to passive loads) may be displayed graphically using a [[Smith chart]]. The Smith chart is a polar plot of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is given directly by the distance of a point to the center (with the edge of the Smith chart corresponding to &lt;math&gt;|\Gamma|=1&lt;/math&gt;). Its evolution along a transmission line is likewise described by a rotation of &lt;math&gt;2\phi&lt;/math&gt; around the chart's center. Using the scales on a Smith chart, the resulting impedance (normalized to &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt;) can directly be read. Before the advent of modern electronic computers, the Smith chart was of particular use as a sort of  [[Nomogram|analog computer]] for this purpose.

=== Standing  wave ratio ===
{{main|Standing  wave ratio}}
The [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR) is determined solely by the ''magnitude'' of the reflection coefficient: 

:&lt;math&gt; SWR =  {1+| \Gamma |   \over 1- | \Gamma | } &lt;/math&gt; .

Along a lossless transmission line of characteristic impedance ''Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', the SWR signifies the ratio of the voltage (or current) maxima to minima (or what it would be if the transmission line were long enough to produce them). The above calculation assumes that  &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; has been calculated using ''Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the reference impedance. Since it uses only the ''magnitude'' of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, the SWR intentionally ignores the specific value of the load impedance ''Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' responsible for it, but only the magnitude of the resulting [[impedance mismatch]]. That SWR remains the same wherever measured along a transmission line (looking towards the load) since the addition of a transmission line length to a load &lt;math&gt;Z_L&lt;/math&gt; only changes the phase, not magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. While having a one-to-one correspondence with reflection coefficient, SWR is the most commonly used figure of merit in describing the mismatch affecting a [[radio antenna]] or antenna system. It is most often [[SWR meter|measured]] at the transmitter side of a transmission line, but having, as explained, the same value as would be measured at the antenna (load) itself.

== Seismology ==

Reflection coefficient is used in feeder testing for reliability of medium.

== Optics and microwaves ==
{{main|Fresnel equations}}
In [[optics]] and electromagnetics in general, &quot;reflection coefficient&quot; can refer to either the amplitude reflection coefficient described here, or the [[reflectance]], depending on context. Typically, the reflectance is represented by a capital ''R'', while the amplitude reflection coefficient is represented by a lower-case ''r''. These related concepts are covered by [[Fresnel equations]] in [[Optics#Classical_optics|classical optics]].

{{Orphan|date=February 2013}}

In [[telecommunications]], '''reflection loss''' occurs on a line which results in part of the energy being reflected back to the source. This can occur:
#At a discontinuity or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] mismatch, e.g., in a [[transmission line]], the ratio of the incident [[Power (physics)|power]] to the reflected power. Reflection loss is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]]. 
#In an [[optical fiber]], the loss that takes place at any discontinuity of [[refractive index]], especially at an air-[[glass]] [[wiktionary:interface|interface]] such as a fiber endface, at which a fraction of the optical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] is reflected back toward the source. This reflection phenomenon is also called &quot;'''[[Fresnel reflection]] loss''',&quot; or simply &quot;'''Fresnel loss'''.&quot;

In [[telecommunication]]s and [[radar]], a '''reflective array antenna''' is a class of [[directional antenna|directive]] [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]s  in which multiple [[driven element]]s are mounted in front of a flat surface designed to reflect the [[radio waves]] in a desired direction. They are a type of [[array antenna]].  They are often used in the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] frequency bands. VHF examples are generally large and resemble a highway [[billboard]], so they are sometimes called '''billboard antennas''', or in Britain '''hoarding antennas'''.  Other names are '''bedspring array'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41vUCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22bedspring+array%22+antenna&amp;pg=PT236 | title=NAVEDTRA 14183 - Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series | publisher=Lulu Press | date=September 1998 | author=US Navy | volume=Module 11 - Microwave principles | pages=236 | isbn=1329667700}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''bowtie array''' depending on the type of elements making up the antenna.   The [[curtain array]] is a larger version used by [[shortwave]] radio broadcasting stations.

Reflective array antennas usually have a number of identical driven elements, fed [[in phase]], in front of a flat, electrically large [[reflector (antenna)|reflecting surface]] to produce a [[directional antenna|unidirectional]] beam of radio waves,  increasing [[antenna gain]] and reducing  [[radiation]] in unwanted directions.  The larger the number of elements used, the higher the gain; the narrower the beam is and the smaller the [[sidelobe]]s are.   The individual elements are most commonly [[half wave dipole]]s, although they sometimes contain [[parasitic element]]s as well as driven elements.  The reflector may be a metal sheet or more commonly a wire screen.  A metal screen reflects radio waves as well as a solid metal sheet as long as the holes in the screen are smaller than about one-tenth of a wavelength, so screens are often used to reduce weight and wind loads on the antenna.  They usually consist of a grill of parallel wires or rods, oriented parallel to the axis of the dipole elements.

The driven elements are fed by a network of [[transmission line]]s, which divide the power from the RF source equally between the elements.  This often has the circuit geometry of a tree structure.

==Basic concepts==
===Radio signals===
When a radio signal passes a conductor, it [[Electromagnetic induction|induces an electrical current]] in it. Since the radio signal fills space, and the conductor has a finite size, the induced currents add up or cancel out as they move along the conductor. A basic goal of antenna design is to make the currents add up to a maximum at the point where the energy is tapped off. To do this, the antenna elements are sized in relation to the wavelength of the radio signal, with the aim of setting up [[standing wave]]s of current that are maximized at the feed point.

This means that an antenna designed to receive a particular wavelength has a natural size. To improve reception, one cannot simply make the antenna larger; this will improve the amount of signal intercepted by the antenna, which is largely a function of area, but will lower the efficiency of the reception (at a given wavelength). Thus, in order to improve reception, antenna designers often use multiple elements, combining them together so their signals add up. These are known as ''[[Antenna array (electromagnetic)|antenna arrays]]''.

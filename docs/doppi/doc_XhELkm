The after-effect of the Battle of Moira (Mag Rath) in regards to Scottish Dál Riata appears to have resulted in it becoming tributary to Northumbrian kings, which lasted until the [[Picts|Pictish]] king [[Bridei III of the Picts|Bruide mac Bili]] defeated [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria]] at [[Battle of Dun Nechtain|Dun Nechtain]] in 685. It is not certain that this subjection ended in 685, although this is usually assumed to be the case.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnán, ''Life of St Columba'', notes 360, 362; Broun, &quot;Dál Riata&quot;; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 116–118; Sharpe, &quot;The thriving of Dalriada&quot;, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it appears that [[Eadberht of Northumbria|Eadberht Eating]] made some effort to stop the Picts under [[Óengus I of the Picts|Óengus mac Fergusa]] crushing Dál Riata in 740. Whether this means that the tributary relationship had not ended in 685, or if Eadberht sought only to prevent the growth of Pictish power, is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Continuation of Bede's Ecclesiastical History (trans. Sellar), s.a. 740; [[Historia Regum Anglorum]] of [[Symeon of Durham]], s.a. 740; also the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', manuscript D, which reports the burning of York, see also 741.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it has been thought that Dál Riata swallowed Pictland to create the [[Kingdom of Alba]], the later history of Dál Riata has tended to be seen as a prelude to future triumphs.&lt;ref&gt;The titles alone of John Bannerman's &quot;The Scottish Takeover of Pictland&quot; and Richard Sharpe's &quot;The thriving of Dalriada&quot; tell their own story.&lt;/ref&gt; The annals make it clear that the Cenél Gabraín lost any earlier monopoly of royal power in the late 7th century and in the 8th, when Cenél Loairn kings such as [[Ferchar Fota]], his son [[Selbach mac Ferchair|Selbach]], and grandsons [[Dúngal mac Selbaig|Dúngal]] and [[Muiredach mac Ainbcellaig|Muiredach]] are found contesting for the kingship of Dál Riata. The long period of instability in Dál Riata was only ended by the conquest of the kingdom by Óengus mac Fergusa, king of the Picts, in the 730s. After a third campaign by Óengus in 741, Dál Riata then disappears from the Irish records for a generation.

===The last century===
[[Áed Find]] may appear in 768, fighting against the Pictish king of [[Fortriu]].&lt;ref&gt;Annals of Ulster, s.a. 768: &quot;A battle in Foirtriu between Aed and Cinaed.&quot; It is assumed that Áed Find is the &quot;Aedh&quot; in question, but cf. the Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 763—corresponding with anno 768 in the Annals of Ulster—where it is reported: &quot;A battle was fought between the Leinstermen themselves, namely, between Cinaech, son of Flann, and Aedh, at Foirtrinn, where Aedh was slain.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; At his death in 778 Áed Find is called &quot;king of Dál Riata&quot;, as is his brother [[Fergus mac Echdach]] in 781.&lt;ref&gt;Dates from the Annals of Ulster. The [[Annals of the Four Masters]] report the deaths of Abbots of [[Lismore, Scotland|Lismore]], but nothing of Dál Riata except reports of the death of Áed, s.a. 771, and of his brother Fergus, s.a. 778.&lt;/ref&gt; The Annals of Ulster say that a certain Donncoirche, &quot;king of Dál Riata&quot; died in 792, and there the record ends. Any number of theories have been advanced to fill the missing generations, none of which are founded on any very solid evidence.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion in Broun, &quot;Pictish Kings&quot;, where another theory is advanced.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of kings are named in the ''Duan Albanach'', and in royal genealogies, but these are rather less reliable than we might wish. The obvious conclusion is that whoever ruled the petty kingdoms of Dál Riata after its defeat and conquest in the 730s, only Áed Find and his brother Fergus drew the least attention of the chroniclers in Iona and Ireland. This argues very strongly for Alex Woolf's conclusion that Óengus mac Fergusa &quot;effectively destroyed the kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, &quot;Ungus (Onuist), son of Uurguist.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unlikely that Dál Riata was ruled directly by Pictish kings, but it is argued that [[Domnall mac Caustantín|Domnall]], son of [[Caustantín of the Picts|Caustantín mac Fergusa]], was king of Dál Riata from 811 to 835. He was apparently followed by the last named king of Dál Riata [[Áed mac Boanta]], who was killed in the great Pictish defeat of 839 at the hands of the [[Vikings]].&lt;ref&gt;Broun, &quot;Pictish Kings&quot;, passim; Clancy, &quot;Caustantín son of Fergus (Uurguist).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, the Picts were becoming [[Gaelicized]], and it is suggested that there was a merger of the Dál Riatan and Pictish kingships.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Bob. ''Scotland: The Making and Unmaking of the Nation, c.1100–1707''. Dundee University Press, 2006, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, this is attributed to [[Cináed mac Ailpín]] (Kenneth MacAlpin), who became king of the Picts in about 843. Some sources say that Cináed was king of Dál Riata for two years before this. Under the [[House of Alpin]], Dál Riata and Pictland merged to form the [[Kingdom of Alba]] or Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Alex. ''From Pictland to Alba, 789-1070''. Edinburgh University Press, 2007. pp.95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Dál Riata to the Innse Gall===
If the Vikings had a great impact on Pictland and in Ireland, in Dál Riata, as in Northumbria, they appear to have entirely replaced the existing kingdom with a new entity. In the case of Dál Riata, this was to be known as the [[Kingdom of the Isles|kingdom of the Sudreys]], traditionally founded by [[Ketil Flatnose]] (''Caitill Find'' in Gaelic) in the middle of the 9th century. The [[Francia|Frankish]] ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' may record the conquest of the [[Inner Hebrides]], the seaward part of Dál Riata, by Vikings in 847.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 99–100 &amp; 286–289; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alex Woolf]] has suggested that there occurred a formal division of Dál Riata between the [[Norse-Gaels|Norse-Gaelic]] [[Uí Ímair]] and the natives, like those divisions that took place elsewhere in Ireland and Britain, with the Norse controlling most of the islands, and the Gaels controlling the Scottish coast and the more southerly islands. In turn, Woolf suggests that this gave rise to the terms ''Airer Gaedel'' and ''Innse Gall'', respectively &quot;the coast of the Gaels&quot; and the &quot;Islands of the foreigners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Woolf, &quot;Age of Sea-Kings&quot;, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under the House of Alpin===

Woolf has further demonstrated that, by the time of [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]], the leading ''cenela'' of Dál Riata had moved from the southwest of the region (north of the Firths) to the north, east, and northeast, with Cenel Loairn moving up the [[Great Glen]] to occupy [[Mormaerdom of Moray|Moray]], the former and sometimes still [[Fortriu]], one branch of Cenel nGabhrain occupying the district known as [[Gowrie]] and another the district of [[Mormaerdom of Fife|Fife]], Cenel nOengusa giving its name to [[Circinn]] as [[Mormaer of Angus|Angus]], Cenel Comgaill occupying [[Mormaerdom of Strathearn|Strathearn]], and another lesser known kindred, Cenel Conaing, probably moving to [[Mormaerdom of Mar|Mar]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Alex. ''From Pictland to Alba'', pp. 226–230&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==

In [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s 1965 novel ''[[The Mark of the Horse Lord]]'', the Dál Riada undergo an internal struggle for control of royal succession, and an external conflict to defend their frontiers against the [[Caledonians|Caledones]].

In [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s historical adventure novel ''[[The Eagle of the Ninth]]'' (1954), a young Roman officer searches to recover the lost Roman eagle standard of his father's legion in the northern part of Great Britain. The story is based on the [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth Spanish Legion]]'s supposed disappearance in the Scottish Highlands near the end of the Roman occupation. The novel was adapted by [[Jeremy Brock]] into the film ''[[The Eagle (2011 film)|The Eagle]]'' (2011).

In the Kushiel novels (a series, beginning with ''[[Kushiel's Dart]]'', 2001), by [[Jacqueline Carey]], the Dalriada of the [[Kingdom of Alba]] figure prominently in a Royal marriage and subsequent alliance with France (known in the series as &quot;Terre d'Ange&quot;).

In [[Julian May]]'s [[Saga of Pliocene Exile]] series, the non-born Aiken Drum's homeworld is an ethnic Scottish planet called Dalriada.

In the ''[[Lost Girl]]'' television series, the pub where the Light Fae and the Dark Fae mingle is called the Dal Riata; named after the ancient kingdom.

In Jules Watson's Dalriada Trilogy (2006–2008), three centuries are chronicled during the time of [[the Roman Invasion of Britain]].

A feature length fantasy film previously named ''Dalriata's King'', later named ''[[The Gaelic King]]'' was made in Scotland, with a story based loosely on the first king of the Scots. It was released to home media in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fellowshipfilm.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Gaelic King|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5072852/|access-date=2019-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dál Riata is a playable nation in [[Paradox Interactive]]'s [[4X]] [[video game]] ''[[Crusader Kings II]]''. At the earliest start date, 769 with the ''Charlemagne'' [[Downloadable content|DLC]], they are an [[Irish Catholic]] independent [[petty kingdom]] ruled by [[Áed Find]], comprising the Hebrides and [[Argyll]]. The game will also use Dál Riata to refer to the Duchy of the Isles whenever the realm's top liege is Irish

Dalriada is the name of a Hungarian folk metal band: ''[[Dalriada (band)|Dalriada]]''.

Year '''188''' ('''CLXXXVIII''') was a [[leap year starting on Monday]] of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Fuscianus and Silanus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 941 ''Ab urbe condita'''''). The denomination 188 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== javax.rmi ===
{{Main|RMI-IIOP}}

The {{Javadoc:SE|package=javax.rmi|javax/rmi}} package provides the support for the remote communication between applications, using the RMI over IIOP protocol. This protocol combines RMI and CORBA features.

[http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/corba/index.jsp Java SE Core Technologies - CORBA / RMI-IIOP]

=== javax.swing ===
{{Main|Swing (Java)}}

[[Swing (Java)|Swing]] is a collection of routines that build on &lt;code&gt;java.awt&lt;/code&gt; to provide a platform independent [[widget toolkit]]. {{Javadoc:SE|package=javax.swing|javax/swing}} uses the 2D drawing routines to render the user interface components instead of relying on the underlying native [[operating system]] GUI support.

This package contains the largest number of classes (133 in all) in JDK 6. This package, along with &lt;code&gt;java.awt&lt;/code&gt; also contains the largest number of enums (7 in all) in JDK 6. It supports pluggable looks and feels (PLAFs) so that widgets in the GUI can imitate those from the underlying native system. Design patterns permeate the system, especially a modification of the [[model-view-controller]] pattern, which loosens the [[coupling (computer science)|coupling]] between function and appearance. One inconsistency is that (as of J2SE 1.3) fonts are drawn by the underlying native system, and not by Java, limiting text portability. Workarounds, such as using bitmap fonts, do exist. In general, &quot;layouts&quot; are used and keep elements within an aesthetically consistent GUI across platforms.

=== javax.swing.text.html.parser ===
The {{Javadoc:SE|package=javax.swing.text.html.parser|javax/swing/text/html/parser}} package provides the error tolerant HTML parser that is used for writing various web browsers and web bots.

=== javax.xml.bind.annotation ===
The {{Javadoc:SE|package=javax.xml.bind.annotation|javax/xml/bind/annotation}} package contains the largest number of Annotation Types (30 in all) in JDK 6. It defines annotations for customizing Java program elements to XML Schema mapping.

== OMG packages ==

=== org.omg.CORBA ===
{{Main|CORBA}}

The {{Javadoc:SE|package=org.omg.CORBA|org/omg/CORBA}} package provides the support for the remote communication between applications using the [[General Inter-ORB Protocol]] and supports other features of the [[CORBA|common object request broker architecture]]. Same as [[Java remote method invocation|RMI]] and [[RMI-IIOP]], this package is for calling remote methods of objects on other virtual machines (usually via network).

This package contains the largest number of &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; classes (45 in all) in JDK 6. From all communication possibilities CORBA is portable between various languages; however, with this comes more complexity.

These packages were deprecated in Java 9 and removed from Java 11.&lt;ref&gt;https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/320&lt;/ref&gt;

=== org.omg.PortableInterceptor ===
The {{Javadoc:SE|package=org.omg.PortableInterceptor|org/omg/PortableInterceptor}} package contains the largest number of interfaces (39 in all) in JDK 6. It provides a mechanism to register ORB hooks through which ORB services intercept the normal flow of execution of the ORB.

'''Elia Kazan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|l|i|ə|_|k|ə|ˈ|z|æ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/kazan Dictionary.com – Kazan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/elia-kazan Oxford Learners' Dictionary – Elia Kazan]&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Elias Kazantzoglou''' ({{lang-el|Ηλίας Καζαντζόγλου}});&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-el|Ηλίας Καζαντζόγλου}} {{IPA-el|eˈlia kaˈzan}}. Later in his life, he was known as Ελία Καζάν in Greece—a [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of his English name.&lt;/ref&gt; September 7, 1909 – September 28, 2003) was a Greek-American director, producer, writer and actor, described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as &quot;one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothstein&quot;/&gt;

He was born in  [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] (now named Istanbul), to [[Cappadocian Greeks|Cappadocian Greek]] parents. After attending [[Williams College]] and then the [[Yale]] School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] in 1932, and co-founded the [[Actors Studio]] in 1947. With [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]] and [[Cheryl Crawford]], his actors' studio introduced &quot;[[Method Acting]]&quot; under the direction of [[Lee Strasberg]]. Kazan acted in a few films, including ''[[City for Conquest]]'' (1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/282564%7C282565/Robert-Osborne-on-Method-Acting.html|title=Robert Osborne on Method Acting|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, &quot;I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt; His first such &quot;issue&quot; film was ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947), with [[Gregory Peck]], which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received eight Oscar nominations and three wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by ''[[Pinky (1949 film)|Pinky]]'', one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received twelve Oscar nominations, winning four, and was [[Marlon Brando]]'s breakthrough role. Three years later, he directed Brando again in ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. It also received 12 Oscar nominations, winning eight. In 1955, he directed [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', which introduced [[James Dean]] to movie audiences.

A turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] in 1952 at the time of the [[Hollywood blacklist]], which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues [[Morris Carnovsky]] and [[Art Smith (actor)|Art Smith]], along with the work of playwright [[Clifford Odets]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/16/movies/a-mccarthy-era-memory-that-can-still-chill.html &quot;A McCarthy Era Memory That Can Still Chill] ''New York Times'', January 16, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The two men{{who|date=October 2020}} had made a pact to name each other in front of the committee.&lt;ref&gt;Kazan, Elia, ''A Life''. New York: Doubleday, 1988, pp. 462–63&lt;/ref&gt; Kazan later justified his act by saying he took &quot;only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/arts-entertainment/film/scorsese-gets-personal-in-his-a-letter-to-elia-1.677944 &quot;Scorsese gets personal in his A Letter to Elia&quot;] ''Gulf News'', September 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a half-century later, his anti-Communist testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/22/arts/amid-protests-elia-kazan-receives-his-oscar.html &quot;Amid Protests, Elia Kazan Receives His Oscar] ''New York Times'', March 22, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] called him, &quot;without question, the best director we have in America, [and] capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ciment2&gt;Ciment, Michel.

==Early life==
Elia Kazan was born in the [[Fener]] district of Istanbul, to [[Cappadocian Greeks|Cappadocian Greek]] parents originally from [[Kayseri]] in [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/313858/Elia-Kazan#|title= Elia Kazan.|publisher= www.britannica.com |access-date=2010-09-10|quote= Elia Kazan, original name Elia Kazanjoglous (b. September 7, 1909, Istanbul, Ottoman Empire—d. September 28, 2003, New York City, U.S.), Greek-born American director and author, noted for his successes on the stage, especially with plays by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, and for his critically acclaimed films. At age four, Kazan was brought to the United States with his immigrant Greek family.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Young, Jeff |title= Kazan: the master director discusses his films : interviews with Elia Kazan |publisher= Newmarket Press |year= 2001|page= 9 |isbn= 978-1-55704-446-4|quote= He was born on September 7, 1909 to Greek parents living in Istanbul.

His maternal grandfather was Isaak Shishmanoglou. Elia's brother, Avraam, was born in Berlin and later became a psychiatrist.&lt;ref name=Kazan/&gt;{{rp|21}}

Kazan was raised in the [[Greek Orthodox]] religion and attended Greek Orthodox services every Sunday, where he had to stand for several hours with his father. His mother read the Bible but did not go to church. When Kazan was about eight years old, the family moved to [[New Rochelle, New York]], and his father sent him to a [[Roman Catholic]] catechism school because there was no Orthodox church nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Ciment, ''Kazan on Kazan'', New York: The Viking Press, 1974, pages 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kazan in Paradise 37.jpg|thumb|In the play &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1937)&lt;/center&gt;]]
As a young boy, he was remembered as being shy, and his college classmates described him as more of a loner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-a-2003-09-29-14-Noted-66325967.html|title=Noted Film and Theater Director Elia Kazan Dies|date=September 29, 2003|work=Voice of America News|access-date=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his early life was portrayed in his autobiographical book, ''[[America America]]'', which he made into a film in 1963. In it, he describes his family as &quot;alienated&quot; from both their parents' Greek Orthodox values and from those of mainstream America.&lt;ref name=Rapf/&gt;{{rp|23}} His mother's family were cotton merchants who imported cotton from England and sold it wholesale.  His father had become a rug merchant after emigrating to the United States and expected that his son would go into the same business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/31/Elia-Kazan.html |title=Elia Kazan Biography (1909–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |access-date=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending public schools through high school, Kazan enrolled at [[Williams College]] in Massachusetts, where he helped pay his way by waiting tables and washing dishes; he still graduated cum laude. He also worked as a bartender at various fraternities, but never joined one. While a student at Williams, he earned the nickname &quot;Gadg,&quot; for Gadget, because, he said, &quot;I was small, compact, and handy to have around.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothstein&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/28/obituaries/28CND-KAZAN.html|title=Elia Kazan, Influential Director, Dies at 94|last=Rothstein|first=Mervyn|date=September 28, 2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname was eventually taken up by his stage and film stars.

In ''America America'' he tells how, and why, his family left Turkey and moved to America. Kazan notes that much of it came from stories that he heard as a young boy. He says during an interview that &quot;it's all true: the wealth of the family was put on the back of a donkey, and my uncle, really still a boy, went to Istanbul ... to gradually bring the family there to escape the oppressive circumstances ... It's also true that he lost the money on the way, and when he got there he swept rugs in a little store.&quot;&lt;ref name=Young&gt;Young, Jeff. ''Kazan: The Master Director Discusses his Films'', Newmarket Press N.Y. (1999) pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazan notes some of the controversial aspects of what he put in the film. He writes &quot;I used to say to myself when I was making the film that America was a dream of total freedom in all areas.&quot;&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; To make his point, the character who portrays Kazan's uncle Avraam kisses the ground when he gets through customs, while the Statue of Liberty and the American flag are in the background. Kazan had considered whether that kind of scene might be too much for American audiences:

{{quote|text=I hesitated about that for a long time. A lot of people, who don't understand how desperate people can get, advised me to cut it. When I am accused of being excessive by the critics, they're talking about moments like that. But I wouldn't take it out for the world. It actually happened. Believe me, if a Turk could get out of Turkey and come here, even now, he would kiss the ground. To oppressed people, America is still a dream.&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;}}

Before undertaking the film, Kazan wanted to confirm many of the details about his family's background. At one point, he sat his parents down and recorded their answers to his questions. He remembers eventually asking his father a &quot;deeper question: 'Why America? What were you hoping for?'&quot; His mother gave him the answer, however: &quot;A.E. brought us here.&quot; Kazan states that &quot;A.E. was my uncle Avraam Elia, the one who left the Anatolian village with the donkey. At twenty-eight, somehow—this was the wonder—he made his way to New York. He sent home money and in time brought my father over. Father sent for my mother and my baby brother and me when I was four.''&lt;ref name=Kazan2&gt;Kazan, Elia. ''Kazan on Directing'', Vintage Books (Jan. 2010) pp. 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazan writes of the movie, &quot;It's my favorite of all the films I've made; the first film that was entirely mine.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kazan2/&gt;

== Career ==
=== 1930s: Stage Career ===
[[File:Group-Theatre-1938.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Elia Kazan (back row, right) with other members of the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] in 1938]]

In 1932, after spending two years at the [[Yale University]] School of Drama, he moved to New York City to become a professional stage actor. He continued his professional studies at the [[Juilliard School]] where he studied singing with [[Lucia Dunham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/04/03/82714582.html|title=Mrs. Lucia Dunham, Juilliard Teacher|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 3, 1959|page=27|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first opportunity came with a small group of actors engaged in presenting plays containing &quot;social commentary&quot;. They were called the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]], which showcased many lesser known plays with deep social or political messages. After struggling to be accepted by them, he discovered his first strong sense of self in America within the &quot;family of the Group Theatre, and more loosely in the radical social and cultural movements of the time,&quot; writes film author Joanna E. Rapf.&lt;ref name=Rapf/&gt;{{rp|23}}

In Kazan's autobiography, he writes of the &quot;lasting impact on him of the Group,&quot; noting in particular, [[Lee Strasberg]] and [[Harold Clurman]] as &quot;father figures&quot;, along with his close friendship with playwright [[Clifford Odets]]. Kazan, during an interview with Michel Ciment, describes the Group:
:The Group was the best thing professionally that ever happened to me. I met two wonderful men. Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman, both of whom were around thirty years old. They were magnetic, fearless leaders. During the summer I was an apprentice, they were entertaining in a Jewish summer camp ... At the end of the summer they said to me: &quot;You may have talent for something, but it's certainly not acting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ciment 1974:&amp;nbsp;15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazan, in his autobiography, also describes Strasberg as a vital leader of the group:

:He carried with him the aura of a prophet, a magician, a witch doctor, a psychoanalyst, and a feared father of a Jewish home ... [H]e was the force that held the thirty-odd members of the theatre together, and made them permanent.&lt;ref name=Kazan&gt;Kazan, Elia. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xglC324UIUgC ''Elia Kazan: A Life''], Da Capo Press (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}

Kazan's first national success came as a New York theatrical director.&lt;ref name=Kazan1&gt;Kazan, Elia; Baer, William. ''Elia Kazan: Interviews'', Univ. Press of Mississippi (2000) pp. vii–xi&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially he worked as an actor on stage, and told early in his acting career that he had no acting ability, he surprised many critics by becoming one of the Group's most capable actors. In 1935 he played the role of a strike-leading taxi driver in a drama by Clifford Odets, ''Waiting for Lefty'', and his performance was called &quot;dynamic,&quot; leading some to describe him as the &quot;proletarian thunderbolt.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rapf/&gt;{{rp|23}}

Among the themes that would run through all of his work were &quot;personal alienation and an outrage over social injustice&quot;, writes film critic William Baer.&lt;ref name=Kazan1/&gt; Other critics have likewise noted his &quot;strong commitment to the social and social psychological—rather than the purely political—implications of drama&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rapf/&gt;{{rp|33}}

By the mid-1930s, when he was 26, he began directing a number of the Group Theatre's plays, including [[Robert Ardrey]]'s well-known play ''[[Thunder Rock (play)|Thunder Rock]]''. In 1942 he achieved his first notable success by directing a play by [[Thornton Wilder]], ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'', starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]] and [[Fredric March]]. The play, though controversial, was a critical and commercial success and won Wilder a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Kazan won the [[New York Drama Critics Award]] for Best Director and Bankhead for best actress. Kazan then went on to direct ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' by [[Arthur Miller]], and then directed ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' by [[Tennessee Williams]], both of which were also successful. Kazan's wife, Molly Thacher, the reader for the Group, discovered Williams and awarded him a &quot;prize that launched his career.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lahr&gt;Lahr, John.

The Group Theatre's summer rehearsal headquarters was at [[Pine Brook Country Club]], located in the countryside of [[Nichols, Connecticut]], during the 1930s and early 1940s. Along with Kazan were numerous other artists: [[Harry Morgan]], [[John Garfield]], [[Luise Rainer]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[Will Geer]], [[Howard Da Silva]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Lee J. Cobb]] and [[Irwin Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Odets: American Playwright: The Years from 1906 to 1940, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pinewoodlake.org/ |title=Pinewood Lake website retrieved on 2010-09-10 |access-date=September 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727174723/http://www.pinewoodlake.org/ |archive-date=July 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Images of America, Trumbull Historical Society, 1997, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940s: The Actors Studio, Early films ===
In 1947, he founded the [[Actors Studio]], a non-profit workshop, with actors [[Robert Lewis (director)|Robert Lewis]] and [[Cheryl Crawford]]. In 1951, [[Lee Strasberg]] became its director after Kazan left for Hollywood to focus on his career as a movie director. It remained a non-profit enterprise. Strasberg introduced the &quot;[[Method acting|Method]]&quot; to the Actors Studio, an umbrella term for a constellation of systemizations of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s teachings. The &quot;Method&quot; school of acting became the predominant system of post-World War II Hollywood.

Among Strasberg's students were [[Montgomery Clift]], [[Mildred Dunnock]], [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Karl Malden]], [[Patricia Neal]], [[Maureen Stapleton]], [[Eli Wallach]], and [[James Whitmore]]. 
Kazan directed two of the Studio's protégés, Karl Malden and [[Marlon Brando]], in the [[Tennessee Williams]] play ''A Streetcar Named Desire''.

Though at the height of his stage success, Kazan turned to Hollywood as a director of motion pictures. He first directed two short films, but his first feature film was ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), one of his first attempts to film dramas focused on contemporary concerns, which later became his forte. Two years later he directed ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'', where he tackled a seldom-discussed topic in America, [[antisemitism]], for which he won his first Oscar as Best Director. In 1947, he directed the courtroom drama ''[[Boomerang (1947 film)|Boomerang!]]''. In 1949 he again dealt with a controversial subject when he directed ''[[Pinky (1949 film)|Pinky]]'', which dealt with issues of racism in America, and was nominated for 3 Academy Awards.

=== 1950s: Rise to prominence ===
In 1950 he directed ''[[Panic in the Streets (film)|Panic in the Streets]]'', starring [[Richard Widmark]], in a thriller shot on the streets of [[New Orleans]]. In that film, Kazan experimented with a documentary style of cinematography, which succeeded in &quot;energizing&quot; the action scenes.&lt;ref name=Freer/&gt; He won the [[Venice Film Festival]] International Award as director, and the film also won two Academy Awards. Kazan had requested that [[Zero Mostel]] also act in the film, despite Mostel being &quot;blacklisted&quot; as a result of [[HCUA]] testimony a few years earlier. Kazan writes of his decision:
:Each director has a favorite in his cast, ... my favorite this time was Zero Mostel ... I thought him an extraordinary artist and a delightful companion, one of the funniest and most original men I'd ever met ... I constantly sought his company ... He was one of the three people whom I rescued from the &quot;industry's&quot; blacklist ... For a long time, Zero had not been able to get work in films, but I got him in my film.&lt;ref name=Kazan/&gt;{{rp|383}}

In 1951, after introducing and directing [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Karl Malden]] in the stage version, he went on to cast both in the film version of the play, ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', which won 4 Oscars, being nominated for 12.

Despite these plaudits, the film was considered a step back cinematically with the feel of filmed theater, though Kazan did at first use a more open setting, but he then felt compelled to revert to the stage atmosphere to remain true to the script. He explains:

:On &quot;Streetcar&quot; we worked very hard to open it up, and then went back to the play because we'd lost all the compression. In the play, these people were trapped in a room with each other. What I actually did was to make the set smaller. As the story progressed ... the set got smaller and smaller.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freer/&gt;

{{quote|text=Clara has composed a series of small pieces, which show a musical and tender ingenuity such as she has never attained before. But to have children, and a husband who is always living in the realm of imagination, does not go together with composing. She cannot work at it regularly, and I am often disturbed to think how many profound ideas are lost because she cannot work them out.|author=Robert Schumann{{sfn|Murray|2018|p=129}}}}

She produced one to eight compositions every year beginning at age 11, until her output stopped in 1848, producing only a choral work that year for her husband's birthday and leaving her second piano concerto unfinished.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001}} These two works, while reserved for her opus 18 and 19, were never published.{{sfn|Koch|1991|p=24}} Five years later, however, when she was 34 in 1853, the year she met Brahms, she engaged in a flurry of composing, resulting in 16 pieces that year: a set of piano variations on an &quot;Album Leaf&quot; of her husband (his Op. 99 No. 4), eight &quot;Romances&quot; for piano solo and for violin and piano, and seven songs. These works were published a year later, after Robert's confinement, as her Op. 20 through 23.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|pp=289–337 (Catalogue of Works)}}

For the next 43 years of her life, she only composed piano transcriptions of works by her husband and Brahms, including 41 transcriptions of Robert Schumann's lieder (commissioned by a publisher in 1872), and a short piano duet commissioned for a friend's wedding anniversary in 1879. In the last year of her life, she left several sketches for piano preludes, designed for piano students, as well as some published cadenzas for her performances of Beethoven and Mozart piano concertos.{{sfn|Klassen|2011}}{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|pp=327–28}}

Most of Clara Schumann's music was never played by anyone else and largely forgotten until a resurgence of interest in the 1970s. Today her compositions are increasingly performed and recorded.{{sfn|Savage|2017}}

=== Editor ===
Schumann was the authoritative editor, aided by Brahms and others, of her husband's works for the publishing firm of [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]].{{sfn|Allihn|2019}}{{sfn|Robert Schumann Score|1879}} She also edited 20 sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, letters (''Jugendbriefe'') by her husband in 1885, and his piano works with fingering and other instructions (''Fingersatz und Vortragsbezeichnungen'') in 1886.{{sfn|Klassen|2011}}

=== &quot;War of the Romantics&quot; ===
In the early 1840s the Schumanns were interested in the works of Franz Liszt and his young composer friends of what eventually became known as the [[New German School]],{{sfn|Walker|1993|p=340}} but in the second half of the decade they both became openly hostile toward Liszt{{sfn|Walker|1993|p=342}} because of their more musically conservative outlook and beliefs,{{sfn|Walker|1993|p=343}} Clara more so than Robert, as she had long been the more conservative aesthete in the Schumann marriage.{{sfn|Walker|1993|p=344}} By the mid-1850s, after Robert's decline, the young Brahms had joined the cause,{{sfn|Swafford Book|1997|p=68}} and to promote her ideals and protect what she saw as an attack on her husband's beliefs, she, Brahms, and Joseph Joachim{{sfn|Walker|1993|p=346}}{{sfn|Swafford Book|1997|p=206}} formed a group of conservative musicians{{sfn|Swafford Book|1997|p=195}} who defended Robert Schumann's critical ideals of the legacy and respectability of music, the pinnacle of which had been Beethoven.{{sfn|Bonds|2001|pp=835,837}}

The opposing side of this &quot;[[War of the Romantics]]&quot;, a group of radical progressives in music (most of them from Weimar) led by Liszt and [[Richard Wagner]], desired to not live under the shadow of Beethoven, but to transcend the old forms and ideas of what music had been and instead create what music ''should'' be for the future. The Weimar school promoted the idea of ''[[program music]]'',{{sfn|Bonds|2001|p=838}} while both the Schumanns and Brahms of the Leipzig/Berlin school were strict in their stance that music must and can only be ''[[absolute music]]'',{{sfn|Walker|1993|pp=361,365–66}} a term derisively coined by Wagner.{{sfn|Dahlhaus|1991}}

One of Clara Schumann's difficulties with Liszt stemmed from a philosophical difference in performance practice. He believed that the artist, through physical and emotional performance, interpreted music for the audience. When he performed, Liszt flailed his arms, tossed his head, and pursed his lips.,{{sfn|Pedroza|2010|p=309}} inspiring a [[Lisztomania]] across Europe which has been compared to the [[Beatlemania]] of female fans of [[The Beatles]] over a century later.{{sfn|Walker|1993|pp=340–41}} Clara, in contrast, came to believe that the personality of the musician should be suppressed so that the composer's vision would be clearly evident to listeners.{{sfn|Walker|1993|p=341}}{{sfn|Pedroza|2010|p=311}}

Partisans led active campaigns with public demonstrations at concerts, writings published in the press denigrating reputations, and other public slights designed to embarrass their adversaries. Brahms published a [[Art manifesto|manifesto]] for the &quot;Serious Music&quot; side on 4 May 1861,{{sfn|Walker|1993|p=350}} signed by Clara Schumann, Joachim, Albert Dietrich, Woldemar Bargiel, and twenty others, which decried the purveyors of the &quot;Music of the Future&quot; as &quot;contrary to the innermost spirit of music, strongly to be deplored and condemned&quot;.{{sfn|Walker|1993|pp=348–49}} The ''New Weimar Club'', a formal society with Liszt at its center, held an anniversary celebration of the ''Neue Zeitschrift für Musik'', the magazine Robert Schumann had founded, in his birthplace Zwickau, and conspicuously neglected to invite members of the opposing party, including his widow, Clara. Clara Schumann ceased to perform any of Liszt's works, and she suppressed her husband's dedication to Liszt of his ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C major]]'' when she published his complete works. When she heard that Liszt and [[Richard Wagner]] would be participating in a Beethoven centenary festival in Vienna in 1870, she refused to attend.{{sfn|Braunstein|1971}}

In describing the works of the opposing school, Clara Schumann was particularly scathing of Wagner, writing of his ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'', that he &quot;wears himself out in atrocities&quot;, describing ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' as &quot;horrible&quot;, and referring to ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' as &quot;the most repugnant thing I have ever seen or heard in all my life&quot;.{{sfn|Braunstein|1971}} She also complained that Wagner had spoken of her husband, Mendelssohn, and Brahms in a &quot;scornful&quot; way.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|pp=202–03}} Wagner had poked fun at the musical conservatives in an essay, portraying them as &quot;a musical temperance society&quot; awaiting a Messiah. She held [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Seventh Symphony]] in very low esteem and wrote to Brahms, describing it as &quot;a horrible piece&quot;. Bruckner's symphonies were seen as representative of the New Music due to their advanced harmony, massive orchestration and extended time-scale.{{sfn|Bonds|2001|p=839}} Schumann was more impressed, however, with the early [[Symphony No. 1 (Strauss)|First Symphony in F minor]] by Richard Strauss;{{sfn|Braunstein|1971}} this was before Strauss began composing the highly programmatic music for which he later became famous.

Though Brahms secretly held Wagner's music in high esteem,{{sfn|Swafford Book|1997|pp=195,267–68}} and eventually publicly praised Liszt's works as well, and several of the proponents and signers of the manifesto, including Joachim, relented and joined the &quot;other side&quot;, and the controversy died down, Clara Schumann remained steadfast in her disapproval of the New German School's music during her lifetime.

=== Impact during her lifetime ===

Although Schumann was not widely recognized as a composer for many years after her death, she made a lasting impression as a pianist. Trained by her father to play by ear and memorize, she gave public performances from memory as early as age thirteen, a fact noted as exceptional by her reviewers.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|pp=271–72}} She was one of the first pianists to perform from memory, making it the standard for concerts. She was also instrumental in changing the kind of programs expected of concert pianists. In her early career, before her marriage, she played the customary bravura pieces designed to showcase the artist's technique, often in the form of arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas, written by virtuosos such as Thalberg, Herz, or Henselt. As it was customary to play one's own compositions, she included at least one of her own works in every program, such as Variations on a Theme by Bellini (Op. 8) and the popular Scherzo (Op. 10). However, as she became a more independent artist, her repertoire contained mainly music by leading composers.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=v. 1 p. 316}}{{sfn|Litzmann Bio (German)|1908}}

Schumann influenced pianists through her teaching, which emphasized expression and a singing tone, with technique subordinated to the intentions of the composer. One of her students, [[Mathilde Verne]], carried her teaching to England where she taught, among others, [[Solomon (pianist)|Solomon]]. Another of her students, [[Carl Friedberg]], carried the tradition to the [[Juilliard School]] in America, where his students included [[Malcolm Frager]] and [[Bruce Hungerford]].{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|p=254}}

She was also instrumental in getting the works of Robert Schumann recognized, appreciated and added to the repertoire. She promoted his works tirelessly throughout her life.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001}}

=== Film ===
{{See also|List of composers depicted on film}}
Clara Schumann has been portrayed on screen many times. ''[[Dreaming (1944 German film)|Träumerei]]'' (''Dreaming''), the oldest known Schumann film, premiered on 3 May 1944 in [[Zwickau]].{{sfn|Träumerei|1944}} Possibly the best-known film is ''[[Song of Love (1947 film)|Song of Love]] (1947)''  starring [[Katharine Hepburn]] as Clara, [[Paul Henreid]] as Robert, and [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]] as Brahms.{{sfn|Song of Love|1947}}

In 1954, [[Loretta Young]] portrayed her on ''The Loretta Young Show'' in Season 1, Episode 26: ''The Clara Schumann Story'' (first aired on 21 March 1954), in which she supports the composing career of her husband, played by [[George Nader]], alongside [[Shelley Fabares]] and [[Carleton G. Young]].{{sfn|Loretta Young Show|1954}}

Two more recent German films are ''[[Frühlingssinfonie]]'' (''Spring Symphony'') (1983), starring [[Nastassja Kinski]] as Clara,{{sfn|Frühlingssinfonie|1983}} and the 2008 Helma Sanders-Brahms' film ''[[Geliebte Clara]]'' (''Beloved Clara''), where she is portrayed by [[Martina Gedeck]].{{sfn|Geliebte Clara|2008}}

=== Banknote and conservatory ===
An image of Clara Schumann from an 1835 lithograph by [[Andreas Staub]] was featured on the 100 [[Deutsche Mark]] banknote from 2 January 1989 until the adoption of the euro on 1 January 2002.{{sfn|Buja|2015}}{{sfn|Paper Money Guaranty|2018}} The back of the banknote shows a grand piano she played and the exterior of Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium, where she taught. The great hall of the conservatory's new building is named after her.{{sfn|Negwer|2002}}

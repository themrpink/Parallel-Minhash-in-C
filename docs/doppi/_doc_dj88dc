Moore and Cook eventually reunited for the annual American benefit for the homeless, ''[[Comic Relief USA|Comic Relief]]'', in 1987, and again in 1989 for a British audience at the [[Amnesty International]] benefit ''[[The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball]]''.

Moore was deeply affected by the death of Cook in 1995, and for weeks would regularly telephone Cook's home in London, just to hear his friend's voice on the telephone answering machine. Moore attended Cook's memorial service in London and, at the time, many people who knew him noted that Moore was behaving strangely and attributed it to grief or drinking. In November 1995, Moore teamed up with friend and humorist [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] in organising a two-day salute to Cook in Los Angeles that Moore co-hosted with Lewis.

In December 2004 the [[Channel 4]] television station in the United Kingdom broadcast ''[[Not Only But Always]]'', a TV film dramatising the relationship between Moore and Cook, although the principal focus of the production was on Cook. Around the same time the relationship between the two was also the subject of a stage play called ''[[Pete and Dud: Come Again]]'' by Chris Bartlett and [[Nick Awde]]. For this production Moore is the main subject. Set in a chat-show studio in the 1980s, it focuses on Moore's comic and personal relationship with Cook and the directions their careers took after the split of the partnership.

===Music===
During the 1960s he formed the Dudley Moore Trio, with drummer [[Chris Karan]] and bassist Pete McGurk. Following McGurk's suicide in June 1968, Peter Morgan joined the group as his replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Chilton. John., 2004, ''Who's Who of British Jazz'', London: Continuum, p.240 {{ISBN|9780826472342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore's admitted principal musical influences were [[Oscar Peterson]] and [[Erroll Garner]]. In an interview he recalled the day he finally mastered Garner's unique left-hand strum and was so excited that he walked around for several days with his left hand constantly playing that cadence. His early recordings included &quot;[[My Blue Heaven (song)|My Blue Heaven]]&quot;, &quot;Lysie Does It&quot;, &quot;Poova Nova&quot;, &quot;Take Your Time&quot;, &quot;[[(Back Home Again in) Indiana|Indiana]]&quot;, &quot;Sooz Blooz&quot;, &quot;[[Baubles, Bangles &amp; Beads]]&quot;, &quot;Sad One for George&quot; and &quot;[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]]&quot;. The trio performed regularly on British television, made numerous recordings and had a long-running residency at Peter Cook's London nightclub, the [[The Establishment (club)|Establishment]]. Amongst other albums, they recorded ''[[The Dudley Moore Trio]]'', ''Dudley Moore plays The Theme from Beyond the Fringe and All That Jazz'', ''The World of Dudley Moore'', ''The Other Side Of Dudley Moore'' and ''Genuine Dud''.

Moore was a close friend of record producer [[Christopher Gunning|Chris Gunning]] and played piano (uncredited) on the 1969 single &quot;Broken Hearted Pirates&quot; which Gunning produced for [[Simon Dupree and the Big Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2013/24/r2-sounds-of-the-60s.html |title=Sounds Of The 60s |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=8 June 2013 |accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 he played piano on [[Larry Norman]]'s album ''[[In Another Land (album)|In Another Land]]'', in particular on the song ''The Sun Began to Rain''. In 1981 he recorded ''Smilin' Through'' with Cleo Laine.

He composed the soundtracks for the films ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (1967), ''30 is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia'' (1968), ''[[Inadmissible Evidence (film)|Inadmissible Evidence]]'' (1968), ''[[Staircase (film)|Staircase]]'' (1969), ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' (1978) and ''[[Six Weeks]]'' (1982), among others.

===Later career in film, television and music===
In the late 1970s Moore moved to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], where he had a supporting role in the hit film ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' (1978) with [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Chevy Chase]]. The following year saw his breakout role in [[Blake Edwards]]'s ''[[10 (film)|10]]'', which became one of the [[1979 in film|biggest box-office hits of 1979]] and gave him an unprecedented status as a romantic leading man. Moore followed up with the comedy film ''[[Wholly Moses]]!'', which was not a major success.

In 1981 Moore appeared in the title role of the comedy ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]'', an even bigger hit than ''10''. Co-starring [[Liza Minnelli]] and Sir [[John Gielgud]], it was both commercially and critically successful, Moore receiving an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for Best Actor, whilst Gielgud won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Arthur's stern but compassionate manservant. Moore lost to [[Henry Fonda]] (for ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]''). He did, however, win a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy. In the same year, on British television, Moore was the featured guest subject on ''[[An Audience With...]]''.

His subsequent films, ''[[Six Weeks]]'' (1982), ''[[Lovesick (1983 film)|Lovesick]]'' (1983), ''[[Romantic Comedy (1983 film)|Romantic Comedy]]'' (1983) and ''[[Unfaithfully Yours (1984 film)|Unfaithfully Yours]]'' (1984) were only moderate successes. He won another Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy in 1984, starring in the [[Blake Edwards]] directed ''[[Micki &amp; Maude|Micki + Maude]]'', co-starring [[Amy Irving]].

Later films, including ''[[Best Defense]]'' (1984), ''[[Santa Claus: The Movie]]'' (1985), ''[[Like Father Like Son (1987 film)|Like Father Like Son]]'' (1987), ''[[Arthur 2: On the Rocks]]'', a sequel to the original, ''[[Crazy People]]'' (1990), ''[[Blame It on the Bellboy]]'' (1992) and an [[The Mighty Kong|animated adaptation of ''King Kong'']], were inconsistent in terms of both critical and commercial reception. Moore eventually disowned the ''Arthur'' sequel, but, in later years, Cook would tease him by claiming he preferred ''Arthur 2: On the Rocks'' to ''Arthur''.

In 1986 he once again hosted ''Saturday Night Live'', albeit without Peter Cook this time.

Moore was the subject of the British ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'', for a second time, in March 1987 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at his Venice Beach restaurant; he had previously been honoured by the programme in December 1972.

In addition to acting, Moore continued to work as a composer and pianist, writing scores for a number of films and giving piano concerts, which were highlighted by his popular parodies of classical favourites. He also appeared as Ko-Ko in Jonathan Miller's production of ''[[The Mikado]]'' in [[Los Angeles]] in March 1988.

In 1991 he released the album ''Songs Without Words'' and in 1992 ''Live From an Aircraft Hangar'', recorded at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]].

He collaborated with the conductor [[Georg Solti|Sir Georg Solti]] in 1991 to create a Channel 4 television series, ''Orchestra!'', which was designed to introduce audiences to the symphony orchestra. He later worked with the American conductor [[Michael Tilson Thomas]] on a similar television series, ''Concerto!'' (1993), likewise designed to introduce audiences to classical music concertos.

Moore appeared in two series for [[CBS]], ''[[Dudley (TV series)|Dudley]]'' (1993) and ''[[Daddy's Girls (1994 TV series)|Daddy's Girls]]'' (1994); however, both were cancelled before the end of their run.

Moore had been interviewed for ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1987 by the music critic Rena Fruchter, herself an accomplished pianist, and the two became close friends. By 1995 Moore's film career was on the wane and he was having trouble remembering his lines, a problem he had never previously encountered. It was for this reason he was sacked from [[Barbra Streisand]]'s film ''[[The Mirror Has Two Faces]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deat&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Tributes flood in for Moore |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1898076.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=25 August 2011|date=28 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his difficulties were, in fact, due to the onset of the medical condition that eventually led to his death. Opting to concentrate on the piano, he enlisted Fruchter as an artistic partner. They performed as a duo in the US and [[Australia]]. However, his disease soon started to make itself apparent there as well, as his fingers would not always do what he wanted them to do. Further symptoms such as slurred speech and loss of balance were misinterpreted by the public and the media as a sign of drunkenness. Moore himself was at a loss to explain this. He moved into Fruchter's family home in [[New Jersey]] and stayed there for five years; however, this placed a great strain both on her marriage and her friendship with Moore, and she later set him up in the house next door.

== Restaurant ==
[[Tony Bill]] and Dudley Moore founded a restaurant in 1983 (closed in November 2000), ''[[72 Market Street Oyster Bar and Grill]]'', in [[Venice, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://veniceupdate.com/2017/03/19/tony-bill-addresses-snap-protestors-regarding-snapchat/|title=» Tony Bill Addresses Snap Protestors Regarding Snapchat |website=Veniceupdate.com|accessdate=6 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;People_Oyster&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Dudley Moore and Tony Bill Star at 72 Market Street, and the Customers Eat It Up |url=https://people.com/archive/dudley-moore-and-tony-bill-star-at-72-market-street-and-the-customers-eat-it-up-vol-22-no-12/ |website=People.com |date=September 17, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Moore was married and divorced four times: to actresses [[Suzy Kendall]] (15 June 1968 – 15 September 1972), [[Tuesday Weld]] (20 September 1975 – 18 July 1980; by whom he had a son Patrick on February 26, 1976), Brogan Lane (21 February 1988 – 1991),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/e186f1e2a8a954de521cca3c3583ce3a|title=Dudley Moore Marries Actress-Model Brogan Lane|website=AP NEWS|accessdate=6 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nicole Rothschild (16 April 1994 – 1998; one son, Nicholas, born on June 28, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deseret.com/1995/6/30/19179868/dudley-s-always-had-a-lot-now-he-has-a-little-moore|title=DUDLEY'S ALWAYS HAD A LOT; NOW HE HAS A LITTLE MOORE|date=30 June 1995|website=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=6 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wives-times&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-wives-and-times-of-cuddly-dudley-1337512.html |title=The wives and times of cuddly Dudley |author=Daniel Jeffreys |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=17 June 1996 |accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3634457/Dad-was-messed-up-but-I-forgive-him.html|title='Dad was messed up, but I forgive him'|first=Caroline|last=Goodhart|date=6 January 2005|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/dudley-moore-and-nicole-rothschild-wedding|title=Dudley Moore And Nicole Rothschild Wedding Stock Pictures, Royalty-free Photos &amp; Images - Getty Images|website=www.gettyimages.com|accessdate=6 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He maintained good relationships with Kendall, Weld and Lane, but expressly forbade Rothschild to attend his funeral. At the time his illness became apparent, he was going through a difficult divorce from Rothschild while at the same time sharing a house in Los Angeles with her and her previous husband.&lt;ref name=wives-times/&gt;

Moore dated [[Susan Anton]] in the early 1980s, with a lot of talk being made of their height difference: Moore at {{convert|5|ft|2+1/2|in|m}} and Anton at {{convert|5|ft|11|in|m}}.

In 1994, Moore was arrested and charged with domestic assault after allegedly assaulting his then-girlfriend, Nicole Rothschild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-wives-and-times-of-cuddly-dudley-1337512.html|title=The wives and times of cuddly Dudley|date=17 June 1996|website=The Independent|accessdate=6 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
In April 1997, after spending five days in a New York hospital, Moore was informed that he had calcium deposits in the [[basal ganglia]] of his brain and irreversible frontal lobe damage. In September 1997 he underwent quadruple [[heart bypass]] surgery in London. He also suffered four strokes.&lt;ref name=disease&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/461376.stm | title=Dudley Moore has rare brain disease |work=BBC News |date=30 September 1999 |accessdate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 1999, Moore announced that he was suffering from the terminal degenerative brain disorder [[progressive supranuclear palsy]] (PSP), a [[Parkinson plus syndrome]], some of the early symptoms being so similar to intoxication that he had been reported as being drunk, and that the illness had been diagnosed earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=disease/&gt;

Moore died on the morning of 27 March 2002&lt;ref name=la/&gt; as a result of [[pneumonia]], secondary to immobility caused by the palsy, in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]], at the age of 66. Rena Fruchter was holding his hand when he died; she reported his final words were &quot;I can hear the music all around me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6H8vBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT248 |title=There's Been A Life! |website=Books.google.com|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lists.monstersandcritics.com/popculture/people/famous-last-words/ |title=Famous last words |work=Julian James, Monster lists - Lists.MonstersAndCritics.com |accessdate=24 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612111046/http://lists.monstersandcritics.com/popculture/people/famous-last-words/ |archivedate=12 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore was interred at [[Hillside Cemetery (Scotch Plains, New Jersey)|Hillside Cemetery]] in [[Scotch Plains, New Jersey]]. Fruchter later wrote a memoir of their relationship entitled ''Dudley Moore'' ([[Ebury Press]], 2004).

==Honours and awards==
In 1981 Moore won the Golden Globe for Best Actor for his role in ''Arthur'', for which he was also Oscar-nominated. In November 2001, Moore was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of The British Empire]] (CBE). Despite his deteriorating condition, he attended the ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 16 November to collect his honour in a wheelchair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deat&quot; /&gt;

'''Louis II''' ({{lang-cs|Ludvík}}, {{lang-hr|Ludovik }}, {{lang-hu|Lajos}}, {{lang-sk|Ľudovít}}; 1 July 1506 – 29 August 1526) was [[King of Hungary]], [[King of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[King of Bohemia|Bohemia]] from 1516 to 1526. He was killed during the [[Battle of Mohács]] fighting the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], whose victory led to the Ottoman [[Ottoman Hungary|annexation of Hungary]].{{sfn|Johnson|2011|p=75}} He had no legitimate issue.

== Early life ==
At his premature birth in Buda on 1 July 1506, the court doctors kept him alive by slaying animals and wrapping him in their warm carcasses as a primitive incubator.{{sfn|Rady|2015|p=76}} He was the only son of [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon]] and his third wife, [[Anne of Foix-Candale]].{{sfn|Cazacu|2017|p=204}}

==Coronation==
Vladislaus II took steps to ensure a smooth succession by arranging for the boy to be crowned in his own lifetime; the coronation of Louis as [[king of Hungary]] took place on 4 June 1508 in [[Székesfehérvár Basilica]], and his coronation as [[king of Bohemia]] was held in 11 March 1509 in [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in [[Prague]].

=== King of Hungary and Croatia ===
{{Main|First Congress of Vienna}}
In 1515 Louis II was married to [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Austria]], granddaughter of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]], as stipulated by the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515. His sister [[Anne of Bohemia and Hungary|Anne]] was married to Mary's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], then a governor on behalf of his brother [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], and later Emperor Ferdinand I.
During the greater part of his reign he was the puppet of the magnates and kept in such penury that he was often obliged to pawn his jewels to get enough food and clothing. His guardians, Cardinal [[Tamás Bakócz]] and Count [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George Brandenburg-Ansbach]], shamefully neglected him, squandered the royal revenues and distracted the whole kingdom with their endless dissensions. Matters grew even worse on the death of cardinal Bakócz, when the magnates [[István Báthory]], [[John Zápolya]] and [[István Werbőczy]] fought each other furiously, and used the diets as their tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Louis II. of Hungary|volume=17|pages=49–50|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== King of Bohemia===
As king of Bohemia, Louis became known as &quot;Ludovicus the Child&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dejepis.com/ucebnice/cesky-stat-za-jagelloncu/ Czech State under Jagellonian Dynasty&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[thaler]] coins were minted during his reign in [[Bohemia]], later giving the name to the [[dollar]]s used in different countries. These correctly style him as &quot;LVDOVICVS•PRIM•D:GRACIA•REX•BO*&quot; (Louis the First, by the grace of God King of Bohemia).

== War with Turks ==

After his father's death in 1516, the minor Louis II ascended to the throne of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and Croatia. Louis was adopted by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] Maximilian I in 1515. When Maximilian I died in 1519, Louis was raised by his legal guardian, his cousin [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]].

Following the accession to the throne of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]], the sultan sent an ambassador to Louis II to collect the annual tribute that Hungary had been subjected to. Louis refused to pay the annual tribute and had the Ottoman ambassador executed and sent the head to the Sultan&lt;ref&gt;That has not any evidence that the Ottoman envoy, Behran chiaus/Çavuş had been executed. But he had been kept waiting years (almost imprisoned in Buda) because of revenge for Suleiman's father, Selim I. enforced the Hungarian envoy(1513-19)the ban of Serim, Barnabás Bélay to travel with him to his champaigns into Persia and Egypt, and find time to ask finance help from western countries against Ottomans.

Louis believed that the [[Papal States]] and other Christian States including [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] would help him. This event hastened the fall of Hungary.

Hungary was in a state of near anarchy in 1520 under the rule of the magnates. The king's finances were a shambles; he borrowed to meet his household expenses despite the fact that they totaled about one-third of the national income. The country's defenses weakened as border guards went unpaid, fortresses fell into disrepair, and initiatives to increase taxes to reinforce defenses were stifled. In 1521 Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent was well aware of Hungary's weakness.

The Ottoman Empire declared war on the Kingdom of Hungary, Suleiman postponed his plan to besiege [[Rhodes]] and made an expedition to [[Belgrade]]. Louis failed to coordinate and gather his forces. At the same time, Hungary was unable to get assistance from other European states, which Louis had hoped for. Belgrade and many strategic castles in Serbia were captured by the Ottomans. This was disastrous for Louis' kingdom; without the strategically important cities of [[Belgrade]] and [[Šabac]], Hungary, including [[Buda]], was open to further Turkish conquests.

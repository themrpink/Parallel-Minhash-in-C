An engineered radio communication system designer will analyze the coverage area desired and select repeater locations, elevations, antennas, operating frequencies and power levels to permit a predictable level of reliable communication over the designed coverage area.

==Data handling==
Repeaters can be divided into two types depending on the type of data they handle:

===Analog repeater===
This type is used in channels that transmit data in the form of an [[analog signal]] in which the voltage or current is proportional to the [[amplitude]] of the signal, as in an [[audio signal]].  They are also used in trunklines that transmit multiple signals using [[frequency division multiplexing]] (FDM). Analog repeaters are composed of a linear amplifier, and may include [[electronic filter]]s to compensate for frequency and phase distortion in the line.

===Digital repeater===
The '''digipeater''' is used in channels that transmit data by [[Binary code|binary]] [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]]s, in which the data is in the form of pulses with only two possible values, representing the [[binary digit]]s 1 and 0.  A digital repeater amplifies the signal, and it also may retime, resynchronize, and reshape the pulses.  A repeater that performs the retiming or resynchronizing functions may be called a '''[[regenerator (telecommunication)|regenerator]]'''.

In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''repeating coil''' is a [[voice-frequency]] [[transformer]] characterized by a closed [[magnetic core]], a pair of identical [[balanced line|balanced]] primary ([[line (electrical engineering)|line]]) [[winding]]s, a pair of identical but not necessarily balanced secondary (drop) windings, and low [[Attenuation|transmission loss]] at [[Voice frequency|voice frequencies]].   It permits transfer of voice [[current (electricity)|current]]s from one winding to another by [[magnetic]] [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]], matches line and [[Drop (telecommunication)|drop]] [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s, and prevents direct [[electrical conduction|conduction]] between the line and the drop.

It is a special application of an [[isolation transformer]], and is often used to prevent [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]]s or earth loops, which cause humming or buzzing in [[sound reproduction|audio]] [[Electronic circuit|circuits]].  It also prevents low [[direct current]] [[voltage]]s from passing.

In [[telecommunication]], the term '''reproduction speed''' has the following meanings: 

# In [[Fax|facsimile]] systems, the rate at which recorded [[Copying|copy]] is produced. (The reproduction speed is usually expressed (a) as the area of recorded copy produced per unit [[time]], such as square meters per second or (b) as the number of pages per minute.)
#In duplicating equipment, the rate at which copies are made. (The reproduction speed is usually expressed in pages per minute.)

'''Resonance''' describes the phenomenon of increased [[amplitude]] that occurs when the [[frequency]] of a  [[Periodic function|periodically]] applied [[force]] (or a [[Fourier analysis|Fourier component]] of it) is equal or close to a [[natural frequency]] of the system on which it acts. When an [[Oscillation|oscillating]] force is applied at a '''resonant frequency''' of a dynamical system, the system will oscillate at a higher amplitude than when the same force is applied at other, non-resonant frequencies.&lt;ref name = &quot;Resnick and Halliday&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Frequencies at which the response amplitude is a [[relative maximum]] are also known as '''resonant frequencies''' or '''resonance frequencies''' of the system.&lt;ref name = &quot;Resnick and Halliday&quot;/&gt; Small periodic forces that are near a resonant frequency of the system have the ability to produce large amplitude oscillations in the system due to the storage of [[vibrational energy]].

Resonance phenomena occur with all types of vibrations or [[wave]]s: there is [[mechanical resonance]], [[acoustic resonance]], [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] resonance, [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), [[electron paramagnetic resonance|electron spin resonance]] (ESR) and resonance of quantum [[wave function]]s. Resonant systems can be used to generate vibrations of a specific frequency (e.g., [[musical instrument]]s), or pick out specific frequencies from a complex vibration containing many frequencies (e.g., filters).

The term ''resonance'' (from [[Latin]] ''resonantia'', 'echo', from ''resonare'', 'resound') originated from the field of acoustics, particularly the [[sympathetic resonance]] observed in musical instruments, e.g., when one string starts to vibrate and produce sound after a different one is struck. Another example, [[electrical resonance]], occurs in a [[Electrical network|circuit]] with [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s because the collapsing magnetic field of the inductor generates an electric current in its windings that charges the capacitor, and then the discharging capacitor provides an electric current that builds the magnetic field in the inductor. Once the circuit is charged, the oscillation is self-sustaining, and there is no external periodic driving action.{{clarify|date=December 2019}}  This is analogous to a mechanical [[pendulum]], where [[mechanical energy]] is converted back and forth between [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy|potential]], and both systems are forms of [[simple harmonic oscillator]]s.

==Overview==

Resonance occurs when a system is able to store and easily transfer energy between two or more different [[storage mode]]s (such as kinetic energy and potential energy in the case of a simple pendulum). However, there are some losses from cycle to cycle, called [[damping]]. When damping is small, the resonant frequency is approximately equal to the [[natural frequency]] of the system, which is a frequency of unforced vibrations. Some systems have multiple, distinct, resonant frequencies.

==Examples==
[[File:Little girl on swing.jpg|thumb|Pushing a person in a [[swing (seat)|swing]] is a common example of resonance. The loaded swing, a [[pendulum]], has a [[natural frequency]] of oscillation, its resonant frequency, and resists being pushed at a faster or slower rate.]]

A familiar example is a playground [[Swing (seat)|swing]], which acts as a [[pendulum]]. Pushing a person in a swing in time with the natural interval of the swing (its resonant frequency) makes the swing go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the swing at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the swing absorbs is maximized when the pushes match the swing's natural oscillations.

Resonance occurs widely in nature, and is exploited in many manmade devices. It is the mechanism by which virtually all [[sinusoidal]] waves and vibrations are generated. Many sounds we hear, such as when hard objects of [[metal]], [[glass]], or [[wood]] are struck, are caused by brief resonant vibrations in the object. Light and other short wavelength [[electromagnetic radiation]] is produced by resonance on an [[Atomic spacing|atomic scale]], such as [[electron]]s in atoms.  Other examples of resonance:

* Timekeeping mechanisms of modern clocks and watches, e.g., the [[balance wheel]] in a mechanical [[watch]] and the [[quartz crystal]] in a [[quartz watch]]
* [[Tidal resonance]] of the [[Bay of Fundy]]
* [[Acoustic resonance]]s of [[musical instruments]] and the human [[vocal tract]]
* Shattering of a crystal wineglass when exposed to a musical tone of the right pitch (its resonant frequency)
* [[Friction idiophone]]s, such as making a glass object (glass, bottle, vase) [[vibration|vibrate]] by rubbing around its rim with a fingertip
* [[Electrical resonance]] of [[tuned circuit]]s in [[radio]]s and [[TV]]s that allow radio frequencies to be selectively received
* Creation of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] light by [[optical resonance]] in a [[laser]] [[Optical cavity|cavity]]
* [[Orbital resonance]] as exemplified by some [[natural satellite|moons]] of the [[solar system]]'s [[gas giants]]
* Material resonances in atomic scale are the basis of several [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques that are used in [[condensed matter physics]]

===Tacoma Narrows Bridge===
{{Main|Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)}}

The dramatically visible, rhythmic twisting that resulted in the 1940 collapse of &quot;Galloping Gertie&quot;, the original [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], is mistakenly characterized as an example of resonance phenomenon in certain textbooks.&lt;ref name = &quot;Resnick and Halliday&quot;/&gt; The catastrophic vibrations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated interaction between the bridge and the winds passing through it—a phenomenon known as [[aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]], which is a [[self oscillation]] or a kind of &quot;self-sustaining vibration&quot; as referred to in the nonlinear theory of vibrations. [[Robert H. Scanlan]], father of [[bridge engineering|bridge]] [[aerodynamics]], has written an article about this misunderstanding.&lt;ref name = &quot;Billah and Scanlan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ketchum.org/billah/Billah-Scanlan.pdf |title=Resonance, Tacoma Narrows Bridge Failure, and Undergraduate Physics Textbooks |author=K.&amp;nbsp;Yusuf Billah and Robert H.

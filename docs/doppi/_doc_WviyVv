{{blockquote|I was in there [a saloon in New York] having a beer one night, and I saw &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; scrawled in soap, I suppose, on this mirror.

Notably, the title can also be found five years before the play's premiere in a 1957 issue of ''The New Yorker''. The passage provides an echo, and perhaps acts as another context, for Albee's own remembrance:

===Characters===
In an interview, Albee said Martha and George were based on two of his friends, the married New York socialites [[Willard Maas]] and [[Marie Menken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gussow|first=Mel|title=Edward Albee: A Singular Journey : A Biography|year=2001|publisher=Applause Theatre Books|location=New York|isbn=1-55783-447-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/edwardalbeesingu00guss_0/page/185 185–186]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/edwardalbeesingu00guss_0/page/185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maas was a professor of literature at [[Wagner College]] and Menken was an experimental filmmaker and painter. Maas and Menken were known for their infamous salons, where drinking would &quot;commence at 4 pm on Friday and end in the wee hours of night on Monday&quot; (according to [[Gerard Malanga]], an [[Andy Warhol]] associate and friend to Maas). The primary conflict between George and Martha in ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' derived from Maas's and Menken's tempestuous and volatile relationship.

==Production history==

===Original production===
''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Billy Rose Theatre]] on October 13, 1962. The original cast featured [[Uta Hagen]] as Martha, [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]] as George, [[Melinda Dillon]] as Honey and [[George Grizzard]] as Nick. It was directed by [[Alan Schneider]]. Subsequent cast members included [[Henderson Forsythe]], [[Eileen Fulton]], [[Nancy Kelly]], [[Mercedes McCambridge]], and [[Elaine Stritch]].

Because of the play's unusual length (over three hours), the producers also cast a matinee company that performed twice a week, featuring [[Kate Reid]] as Martha, [[Shepperd Strudwick]] as George, [[The Bridge - Stage of the Arts#Founder and Artistic Director, Avra Petrides|Avra Petrides]] as Honey and Bill Berger as Nick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=[[The New York Herald Tribune]]| date=October 11, 1962| title=A Director's Double Trouble-- Rehearsing 2 Casts for 1 Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the evening company, these matinee performances also sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Edward Albee: A Singular Journey| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SoylVIJfvgEC&amp;q=kate+reid| first=Mel| last=Gussow| publisher=Simon and Schuster| date=November 27, 2012| isbn=978-1476711706| access-date=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play closed on May 16, 1964, after five previews and 664 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/2773/Whos-Afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf| title=Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?| journal=Playbill| access-date= 15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in London in 1965, starring [[Constance Cummings]].

====Original Broadway cast album====
In 1963, [[Columbia Masterworks]] released a four-[[LP album|LP]] ([[long-playing]]) boxed recording of the original Broadway cast performing the entire play, directed by [[Alan Schneider]].

The release contained a 16-page booklet with photos from the original production, critical essays by [[Harold Clurman]] and [[Walter Kerr]], cast and crew biographies, and a short article by [[Goddard Lieberson]] on the task of recording the play. The introduction is by Albee, in which he writes, &quot;I cannot conceive of anyone wanting to buy [this] massive album; but...every playwright wants as much permanence for his work as he can get.&quot;

The recording was issued in both stereo (DOS 687) and monaural (DOL 287) formats. It was out of print for many years, was not released in other formats, and is highly prized among collectors, as a play with such adult themes had never been recorded for the general public before. It was finally rereleased in 2014 by Broadway Masterworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/theater/listening-to-the-original-whos-afraid-of-virginia-woolf.html| title=Sodden Savages in Their First Flush|date=9 March 2014| work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable productions ===
In 1970, [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Richard Burton]] attempted to recruit [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Jon Voight]] for an all-male production, but Albee refused permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horn| first1=Barbara Lee| title=Edward Albee: A Research and Production Sourcebook| date=2003| publisher=Praeger| location=Westport CT| isbn=978-0313311413| page=245| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nu8Q92GKE88C&amp;q=edward+albee+richard+Burton&amp;pg=PA245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colleen Dewhurst]] and [[Ben Gazzara]] starred in a 1976 Broadway revival.

[[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]] starred in a 1980 production in New Haven.

[[Diana Rigg]] and [[David Suchet]] starred in a 1996 production of the play at the [[Almeida Theatre]] in London before transferring to the [[Aldwych Theatre]] in London's West End in 1997.

A student-directed production employed a theater-in-the-round set in February 2004 at Bentley School in Lafayette, California.

The play was revived on Broadway at the [[Longacre Theatre]], opening on March 12, 2005, in previews and closing on September 4, 2005, after 177 performances and 8 previews. Directed by [[Anthony Page]], it starred [[Kathleen Turner]] as Martha and [[Bill Irwin]] as George, with [[Mireille Enos]] as Honey and [[David Harbour]] as Nick. Irwin won the 2005 [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play]] for his role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=384288 &quot;Listing, 2005 Broadway&quot;] InternetBroadwayDatabase, accessed June 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The production transferred to London's [[West End theatre|West End]] at the [[Apollo Theatre]] with the entire original cast, running from January 31 to May 13, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisistheatre.com/londonshows/whosafraidofvirginiawoolf2006.html &quot;Listing, Apollo Theatre, 2006&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815073709/http://www.thisistheatre.com/londonshows/whosafraidofvirginiawoolf2006.html |date=2012-08-15}} thisistheatre.com, accessed June 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, the production played at the [[John F.

==Awards==
''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' won both the 1963 [[Tony Award for Best Play]] and the 1962–63 [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]] Award for Best Play. Its stars won the 1963 Tony Awards for Best Actor and Actress. It was selected for the 1963 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] by that award's drama jury, but the award's advisory board—the trustees of Columbia University—objected to its profanity and sexual themes, and overruled the jury, awarding no Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Klein| first=Alvin| title=Albee's 'Tiny Alice', The Whole Enchilada| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/24/nyregion/theater-albee-s-tiny-alice-the-whole-enchilada.html| newspaper=The New York Times| date=24 May 1998| page=CT11|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 revival won the 2013 Tony Award, Best Revival of a Play, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Play (Letts) and Best Direction of a Play (MacKinnon).

==Film==
{{Main|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)}}
A film adaptation of the play was released in 1966. It was directed by [[Mike Nichols]] and starred [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Martha, [[Richard Burton (actor)|Richard Burton]] as George, [[George Segal]] as Nick and [[Sandy Dennis]] as Honey. All four major actors were nominated for [[Academy Award]]s: Taylor and Burton for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Actor]] and Dennis and Segal for Supporting [[Academy Award|Oscars]]. Both actresses won. Taylor won the Oscar for Best Actress but Burton was passed over that year in favor of [[Paul Scofield]] in ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man For All Seasons]]''. Dennis won [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]].

[[Jack Valenti]] identified the film as the first controversial movie he had to deal with as president of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA). It was the first to use the slang &quot;screw&quot; and the phrase &quot;hump the hostess&quot;. As he said, &quot;In company with the MPAA's general counsel, [[Louis Nizer]], I met with [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]], the legendary chieftain of [[Warner Bros.]], and his top aide, Ben Kalmenson. We talked for three hours, and the result was deletion of 'screw' and retention of 'hump the hostess', but I was uneasy over the meeting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Jack| last=Valenti| title=How It All Began| url=http://www.mpaa.org/Ratings_HowItAllBegan.asp| publisher=Motion Picture Association of America| access-date=2008-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521023225/http://www.mpaa.org/Ratings_HowItAllBegan.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original film soundtrack album===
{{Citation needed section|date=January 2020}}
The film was given a &quot;Deluxe Edition Two-Record Set&quot; soundtrack album release in 1967 by [[Warner Bros. Records]], and was the first film to have its vocals be released in their entirety on an album, as the film at that time could not be shown in [[rerun]]s on [[network television]].{{Clarify|date=January 2020|reason=How does the last clause relate? The film was not made-for-TV to begin with, so &quot;rerun&quot; doesn't seem to apply. No explanation of why it could never be shown on network TV, or how that has anything to do with vocals being released on an album.}} It contains the vocals of the four actors performing in the film. The only music on the album is a song, &quot;Virginia Woolf Rock&quot;, that plays while Martha and Nick are dancing (but plays a little differently than it does in the film).

In at least two instances alternate takes were used: Taylor's memorable &quot;Goddamn you!&quot; line is restored to &quot;Screw you!&quot;, and some of the dialogue from the dancing sequence was lifted from another take. As Martha tells Nick and Honey her story about punching George in the stomach in front of her father, it is heard very clearly while in the film it becomes muffled as the camera follows George into another room to get a gun. The album also ran a half-hour shorter than the movie as most pauses and long silences were removed, but virtually every line remains intact. The album's cover has the four main actors and the back cover has some background information about them, the five-month shooting schedule, and Albee, and a brief synopsis of the film. The album is out of print, was never released in any other formats, and is highly prized among collectors.

== Print edition ==
The print edition of the play was published in 1962 and was one of the early releases of [[Atheneum Books]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The lady with the Borzoi : Blanche Knopf, literary tastemaker extraordinaire|last=P.|first=Claridge, Laura|isbn=9780374114251|edition= First |location=New York|oclc=908176194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The print edition went on to sell over 70,000 copies in hard and soft cover editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{in popular culture|date=August 2020}}
* On their album ''[[Like the Exorcist, but More Breakdancing]]'', [[Murder by Death (band)|Murder by Death]] had a song titled &quot;I'm Afraid of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://murderbydeath.bandcamp.com/album/like-the-exorcist-but-more-breakdancing|title=Like the Exorcist, but More Breakdancing, by Murder By Death|website=Murder By Death}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Saturday Night Live (season 42)|Saturday Night Live]]'' parodied the play and movie in several sketches, such as &quot;Cocktail Hour&quot; (released online on 10 May 2014) and one about pet hamsters who talk and behave like the play's and film's characters (aired October 15, 2016).
* In ''[[Life Is Strange: Before the Storm]]'' episode 1, Samantha Myers talks to Chloe about the play. In the closing sequence of the third and final episode of the game, Rachel Amber is seen reading the play in Chloe's room. The multiple references to the play may be an oblique reference to Virginia Woolf's novel ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'', as all events in this prequel game lead tragically and inexorably to the lighthouse of the original game.
* In a clear reference to the play, the [[Of Montreal]] song &quot;The Past Is a Grotesque Animal&quot; features the stanza: &quot;The mousy girl screams, &quot;Violence! Violence!&quot; | She gets hysterical | because they're both so mean | And it's my favorite scene&quot;
* In the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode &quot;Camp Refoogee&quot;, a side story arc occurs where Roger and Francine dress up as a professor and his wife respectively and entertain a young couple.
* In the episode [[Heartbreak Hotel (The Simpsons)|&quot;Heartbreak Hotel]]&quot; of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the film and play are parodied in a (black and white) scene involving [[Marge Simpson]] and [[Homer Simpson]], as well as another couple staying in the same hotel, Nick and Honey. George Segal reprised his role as Nick.
* In the series finale of [[Glee (TV series)|Glee]], [[Dreams Come True (Glee)|&quot;Dreams Come True&quot;]], [[Kurt Hummel]] and [[Blaine Anderson]] star in an LGBT+ adaptation of the play.

'''Pope Sixtus V''' or '''Xystus V''' (13 December 1521 – 27 August 1590), born '''Felice Piergentile''', was [[Pope |Bishop of Rome]] and hence head of the [[Catholic Church]] and ruler of the [[Papal States]] from 24 April 1585 to his death in 1590. As a youth, he joined the Franciscan order, where he displayed talents as a scholar and preacher, and enjoyed the patronage of [[Pius V]], who made him a cardinal. As a cardinal, he was known as '''Cardinal Montalto'''.

As Pope, he energetically rooted out corruption and lawlessness across Rome, and launched a far-sighted rebuilding programme that continues to provoke controversy,{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} as it involved the destruction of antiquities. The cost of these works was met by heavy taxation that caused much suffering. His foreign policy was regarded as over-ambitious, and he excommunicated both [[Elizabeth I of England]] and [[Henry IV of France]]. He is recognized as a significant figure of the [[Counter-Reformation]].

==Early life==
Felice Piergentile was born on 13 December 1521 at [[Grottammare]], in the [[Papal States]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien, ''Lives of the Pope'', (HarperCollins, 2000), 292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite linked authority file|id=n80-49584|text=Name and date|accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Francesco Piergentile (also known as Peretto di Montalto, from the city of origin [[Montalto delle Marche]]), and Mariana da Frontillo .&lt;ref name=&quot;Peretti&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1570.htm#Peretti|title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church – Biographical Dictionary – Consistory of 17 May 1570}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had taken refuge in Grottammare to escape the oppression of the [[Duke of Urbino]], finding there a job as a gardener.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peretti&quot; /&gt; Felice later adopted ''Peretti'' as his family name in 1551, and as a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] was known as &quot;Cardinal Montalto&quot; (to reflect his affection to his homeland).&lt;ref name=&quot;Peretti&quot; /&gt;

At the age of 9 years old, Felice came back in [[Montalto delle Marche|Montalto]] to join his uncle in the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] Convent of San Francesco delle Fratte. At the age of 12 he was initiated as a novice of the [[Franciscan Order]], assuming the name of fra Felice in 1535, mainteining his birth name. From this year, he sterted filosiphical and theological studies, travelling in different convents of the Order. Fra Felice finally completed his studies in the Franciscan Magna Domus of [[Bologna]] on September 1544. Three years earlier, he was already ordained as a deacon.

About 1552 he was noticed by [[Cardinal Rodolfo Pio da Carpi]], Protector of the [[Franciscan order]], Cardinal Ghislieri (later [[Pope Pius V]]) and Cardinal Caraffa (later [[Pope Paul IV]]), and from that time his advancement was assured. He was sent to [[Venice]] as [[Inquisition|inquisitor general]] of the [[Venetian Holy Inquisition]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; but was so severe and conducted matters in such a high-handed manner that he became embroiled in quarrels. In 1560, the Venetian government asked for his recall.

After a brief term as [[wikt:procurator|procurator]] of his order, he was attached in 1565 to the papal legation to  Spain headed by Ugo Cardinal Boncampagni (later [[Pope Gregory XIII]]), which was sent to investigate a charge of [[heresy]] levelled against [[Bartolomé Carranza]], [[Archbishop of Toledo]]. The violent dislike which Peretti conceived for Boncampagni exerted a marked influence upon his subsequent actions. He hurried back to Rome upon the accession of Pius V, who made him [[apostolic vicar]] of his order, and, later (1570), [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

During the pontificate of his political enemy Gregory XIII (1572–1585), Cardinal Montalto, as he was generally called, lived in enforced retirement, occupied with the care of his property,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; the Villa Montalto, erected by [[Domenico Fontana]] close to the cardinal's beloved church on the [[Esquiline Hill]], overlooking the ancient [[Baths of Diocletian]]. The first phase (1576–1580) of building was enlarged after Peretti became pope and was able to [[Urban renewal|clear buildings to open four new streets]] in 1585–86. The villa contained two residences, the ''Palazzo Sistino'' or &quot;Palazzo di Termini&quot;&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Termini&quot; was the name given to that district, derived in turn from the ruins of the immense [[Baths of Diocletian]] (in [[Latin language|Latin]], ''[[thermae]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; and the casino, called the ''Palazzetto Montalto e Felice''.

This clearance programme was an undoubted gain in the relief it brought to the congestion of the crowded medieval city. Clearly, however, Romans displaced by it were furious, and resentment was still felt centuries later, until the decision was taken to build the [[Roma Termini railway station|central railroad station]], inaugurated by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1863, the chosen site being the area of the Villa, which became doomed to destruction.

Cardinal Montalto's other occupation at this period was with his studies, one of the fruits of which was an edition of the works of [[Ambrose]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; As pope he would personally supervise the printing of an improved edition of Jerome's [[Vulgate]].

==Papacy==
===Election as pope===
Though not neglecting to follow the course of affairs, Felice carefully avoided every occasion of offence. This discretion contributed not a little to his election to the papacy on 24 April 1585, with the title of Sixtus V. One of the things that commended his candidacy to certain cardinals may have been his physical vigour, which seemed to promise a long pontificate.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The terrible condition in which [[Pope Gregory XIII]] had left the [[Ecclesiastical States|ecclesiastical states]] called for prompt and stern measures. Sixtus proceeded with an almost ferocious severity against the prevailing lawlessness. Thousands of [[brigand]]s were brought to justice: within a short time the country was again quiet and safe.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; It was claimed&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Pastor, ''History of the Popes'', St. Louis, 1898/99, vol 21, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; that there were more heads on spikes across the Ponte Sant'Angelo than melons for sale in the marketplace. And clergy and nuns were executed if they broke their vows of chastity.&lt;ref&gt;Eamon Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners: A history of the popes'', Yale, 2006, p219&lt;/ref&gt;

Next Sixtus set to work to repair the finances. By the sale of offices, the establishment of new &quot;Monti&quot; and by levying new taxes, he accumulated a vast surplus, which he stored up against certain specified emergencies, such as a [[crusade]] or the defence of the [[Holy See]]. Sixtus prided himself upon his hoard, but the method by which it had been amassed was financially unsound: some of the taxes proved ruinous, and the withdrawal of so much money from circulation could not fail to cause distress.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

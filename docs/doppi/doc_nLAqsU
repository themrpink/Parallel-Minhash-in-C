At the time of the [[Domesday Survey]] the industry of Wiltshire was largely agricultural; 390 [[mill (grinding)|mills]] are mentioned, and [[vineyards]] at Tollard and Lacock. In the succeeding centuries sheep-farming was vigorously pursued, and the Cistercian monastery of [[Stanley Abbey|Stanley]] exported wool to the [[Florence|Florentine]] and [[Flanders|Flemish]] markets in the 13th and 14th centuries.

In the 17th century [[English Civil War]] Wiltshire was largely [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]]. The [[Battle of Roundway Down]], a Royalist victory, was fought near [[Devizes]].

In 1794 it was decided at a meeting at the Bear Inn in Devizes to raise a body of ten independent troops of [[Yeomanry]] for the county of Wiltshire, which formed the basis for what would become the [[Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry]], who served with distinction both at home and abroad, during the [[Boer War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry currently lives on as Y (RWY) Squadron, based in Swindon, and B (RWY) Squadron, based in Salisbury, of the [[Royal Wessex Yeomanry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/armoured/regiments/30061.aspx|title=Royal Wessex Yeomanry|last=British Army Website|work=Regimental Page|publisher=British Army|accessdate=5 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065056/http://www.army.mod.uk/armoured/regiments/30061.aspx|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1800 the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] was built through Wiltshire, providing a route for transporting cargoes from [[Bristol]] to London until the development of the [[Great Western Railway]].

Information on the 261 civil parishes of Wiltshire is available on Wiltshire Council's Wiltshire Community History&lt;ref name=&quot;wiltshire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/|title=Wiltshire Council - Wiltshire Community History Introduction|website=Wiltshire.gov.uk|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; website which has maps, demographic data, historic and modern pictures and short histories.

The local nickname for Wiltshire natives is &quot;[[Moonrakers]]&quot;. This originated from a story of [[smuggler]]s who managed to foil the local [[Excise]] men by hiding their alcohol, possibly French [[brandy]] in barrels or kegs, in a village pond. When confronted by the excise men they raked the surface to conceal the submerged [[contraband]] with ripples, and claimed that they were trying to rake in a large round cheese visible in the pond, really a reflection of the full moon. The officials took them for simple yokels or mad and left them alone, allowing them to continue with their illegal activities. Many villages claim the tale for their own village pond, but the story is most commonly linked with The Crammer in [[Devizes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;devizesheritage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devizesheritage.org.uk/the_green_devizes.html|website=Devizesheritage.org.uk|title=The Green and Crammer Pond, Devizes|accessdate=28 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423070252/http://www.devizesheritage.org.uk/the_green_devizes.html|archive-date=23 April 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wiltshire/moonraking/folklore_moonraking.shtml|title=Moonraking: The Folklore|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|work=Where I live: Wiltshire|publisher=BBC Wiltshire|accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology, landscape and ecology==
{{See also|List of hills of Wiltshire|List of rivers of Wiltshire}}
[[File:Cherhillwhitehorse.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cherhill White Horse]], east of Calne ]]

Two-thirds of Wiltshire, a mostly [[Rural area|rural]] county, lies on [[chalk]], a kind of soft, white, porous limestone that is resistant to erosion, giving it a high [[downland|chalk downland]] landscape. This chalk is part of a system of chalk downlands throughout eastern and southern England formed by the rocks of the [[Chalk Group]] and stretching from the [[Dorset Downs]] in the west to [[Dover]] in the east. The largest area of chalk in Wiltshire is [[Salisbury Plain]], which is used mainly for [[agronomy|arable]] agriculture and by the [[British Army]] as training ranges. The highest point in the county is the [[Tan Hill, Wiltshire|Tan Hill]]–[[Milk Hill]] ridge in the [[Vale of Pewsey|Pewsey Vale]], just to the north of Salisbury Plain, at {{convert|295|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.

The chalk uplands run northeast into [[West Berkshire]] in the [[Marlborough Downs]] ridge, and southwest into Dorset as [[Cranborne Chase]]. Cranborne Chase, which straddles the border, has, like Salisbury Plain, yielded much Stone Age and Bronze Age [[archaeology]]. The Marlborough Downs are part of the [[North Wessex Downs AONB]] (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty), a {{convert|1730|sqkm|abbr=in|adj=on}} conservation area.

In the northwest of the county, on the border with [[South Gloucestershire]] and [[Bath and North East Somerset]], the underlying rock is the resistant [[oolite]] [[limestone]] of the [[Cotswolds]]. Part of the Cotswolds AONB is also in Wiltshire, in the county's northwestern corner.

Between the areas of chalk and limestone downland are [[clay]] [[valley]]s and [[River valley|vale]]s. The largest of these vales is the [[River Avon, Bristol|Avon Vale]]. The Avon cuts diagonally through the north of the county, flowing through [[Bradford-on-Avon]] and into [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Bristol]]. The Vale of Pewsey has been cut through the chalk into [[Greensand]] and [[Oxford Clay]] in the centre of the county. In the south west of the county is the [[Vale of Wardour]]. The southeast of the county lies on the sandy soils of the northernmost area of the [[New Forest]].

Chalk is a [[porous]] rock, so the chalk hills have little surface water. The main settlements in the county are therefore situated at wet points. Notably, Salisbury is situated between the chalk of Salisbury Plain and marshy flood plains.

=== Green belt ===
{{main|Avon Green Belt}}
The county has a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] mainly along its western fringes as a part of the extensive [[Avon Green Belt]]. It reaches as far as the outskirts of Rudloe/[[Corsham]] and Trowbridge, preventing urban sprawl particularly from the latter in the direction of [[Bradford-on-Avon]], and affording further protection to surrounding villages and towns from Bath in Somerset.

==Climate==
Along with the rest of [[South West England]], Wiltshire has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than counties further east.&lt;ref name=weather&gt;{{cite web|title=South West England: climate|work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/regional-climates/sw|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual mean temperature is approximately {{convert|10|°C|°F|1}}. Although there is a marked maritime influence, this is generally rather less pronounced, than it is for other south-western counties, which have a greater proximity to the sea.  The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately {{convert|22|°C|°F|1}}. In winter mean minimum temperatures of {{convert|1|°C|°F|1}} or {{convert|2|°C|°F|1}} are usual and air frost normally occurs frequently. In the summer the [[Azores]] high pressure affects southwest England; however, [[convective]] cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours.&lt;ref name=weather/&gt;

In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton (Somerset). Most of the rainfall in the southwest is caused by [[Low-pressure area|Atlantic depressions]] or by [[convection]], though a proportion is caused orographically (uplift over hills). A greater proportion of rainfall is in autumn and winter, caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. Even so, any month can be the wettest or driest in a given year but the wettest is much more likely to be in the winter half year (Oct-Mar) and the driest in the summer half year (Apr-Sept). In summer, a greater proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms, though it is often the northern half of the county that sees most of the showers with south-westerly winds, in summer, whereas in the south of the county, the proximity of a relatively cold English Channel, often inhibits the development of showers. In autumn and winter, however, the sea is often relatively warm, compared with the air passing over it and can often lead to a higher rainfall in the south of the county e.g. Salisbury recorded over 200mm of rain in Nov 2009 and January 2014.  Average rainfall for the county is around {{convert|800|mm|abbr=on}}, drier parts averaging 700mm (28ins)and the wettest 900mm (around 35ins). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the southwest.&lt;ref name=weather/&gt;

The Wiltshire economy benefits from the &quot;[[M4 corridor]] effect&quot;, which attracts business, and the attractiveness of its countryside, towns and villages. The northern part of the county is richer than the southern part, particularly since Swindon is home to national and international corporations such as [[Honda]], [[Intel]], [[Motorola]], [[Patheon]], [[Catalent]] (formerly known as [[Cardinal Health]]), [[Becton-Dickinson]], [[WHSmith]], [[Early Learning Centre]] and [[Nationwide Building Society|Nationwide]], with [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]] located in nearby [[Malmesbury]]. Wiltshire's employment structure is distinctive in having a significantly higher number of people in various forms of [[manufacturing]] (especially [[electrical equipment]] and apparatus, food products, and beverages, furniture, rubber, [[pharmaceuticals]], and plastic goods) than the national average.

In addition, there is higher-than-average employment in [[public administration]] and [[Defense (military)|defence]], due to the military establishments around the county, particularly around [[Amesbury]] and [[MoD Corsham|Corsham]]. There are sizeable [[British Army]] barracks at [[Tidworth Camp|Tidworth]], [[Bulford Camp|Bulford]] and [[Warminster]], and the [[Royal School of Artillery]] is at Larkhill. Further north, [[RAF Lyneham]] was home to the RAF's Hercules C130 fleet until 2011; the [[MoD Lyneham]] site is now a centre for Army technical training. Wiltshire is also distinctive for the high proportion of its working-age population who are economically active (86.6% in 1999–2000) and its low [[Unemployment Rate|unemployment rates]]. The gross domestic product (GDP) level in Wiltshire did not reach the UK average in 1998, and was only marginally above the rate for South West England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Wiltshire Strategic Analysis (2002) |work= Wiltshire CPRE |url= http://www.cprewiltshire.org.uk/tpp/Wiltshire%20Strategic%20Analysis%20-%20LSP.pdf |accessdate= 21 October 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130601221901/http://www.cprewiltshire.org.uk/tpp/Wiltshire%20Strategic%20Analysis%20-%20LSP.pdf |archive-date= 1 June 2013 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and infrastructure==
[[Service Children's Education]] has its headquarters in [[Trenchard Lines]] in [[Upavon]], Wiltshire.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277236/0961.pdf SERVICE CHILDREN’S EDUCATION ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012–2013]&quot; ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132907/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277236/0961.pdf Archive]).

==Education==
{{See also|List of schools in Wiltshire}}
Wiltshire has thirty county secondary schools, publicly funded, of which the largest is [[Warminster Kingdown]], and eleven independent secondaries, including [[Marlborough College]], [[St Mary's School, Calne|St Mary's Calne]], [[Dauntsey's School|Dauntsey's]] near [[Devizes]], and [[Warminster School]]. The county schools are nearly all [[comprehensive school|comprehensives]], with the older pattern of education surviving only in [[Salisbury]], which has two [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar schools]] ([[South Wilts Grammar School]] and [[Bishop Wordsworth's School]]) and three non-selective schools. All but two of the county secondary schools in the former districts of [[West Wiltshire]] and [[North Wiltshire]] have [[sixth form]]s, but only half of those in the rest of the county.

There are four [[further education]] colleges, which also provide some higher education: [[New College, Swindon|New College (Swindon)]]; [[Wiltshire College]] (Chippenham, Trowbridge and Salisbury); [[Salisbury Sixth Form College]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salisbury6c.ac.uk/|title=Salisbury Sixth Form College|website=Salisbury6c.ac.uk|accessdate=14 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Swindon College]]. Wiltshire is also home to two [[University technical college|University Technical Colleges]]: [[South Wiltshire UTC]] (in Salisbury, due to close in August 2020) and [[UTC Swindon]], both specialising in engineering.

Wiltshire is one of the few remaining English counties without a university or university college; the closest university to the county town of Trowbridge is the [[University of Bath]].  However, [[Bath Spa University]] has a centre at [[Corsham Court]] in [[Corsham]], and [[Oxford Brookes University]] maintains a minor campus in [[Swindon]] (almost 50&amp;nbsp;km from Oxford). Outline plans for a projected University of Swindon or University of Wiltshire were announced by the [[Borough of Swindon]] in November 2008, but the scheme remains uncommitted. Swindon therefore remains the UK's largest centre of population without its own university.

==Demographics==
The county registered a population of 680,137 in the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]]. Wiltshire (outside Swindon) has a low population density of 1.4 persons per hectare, when compared against 4.1 for England as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{NOMIS2011|id=1946157355|title=Swindon Local Authority|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NOMIS2011|id=1946157357|title=Wiltshire Local Authority|accessdate=17 March 2018|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NOMIS2011|id=2092957699|title=England Country|accessdate=17 March 2018|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and administration==

=== Europe ===
At the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], Wiltshire voted in favour of [[Brexit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=BREXIT: How Wiltshire voted|url=https://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/news/17536578.brexit-wiltshire-voted/|access-date=2020-11-20|website=The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Westminster Parliamentary===
At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], all [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Wiltshire|seven Wiltshire constituencies]] (including the two Swindon constituencies) returned [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs.

===Councils===
{{Main|Wiltshire Council|Wiltshire local elections|Swindon Borough Council|Swindon local elections}}
The ceremonial county of Wiltshire consists of two unitary authority areas, Wiltshire and Swindon, governed respectively by [[Wiltshire Council]] and [[Swindon (borough)|Swindon Borough Council]].

As a result of elections held in 2017, Wiltshire Council comprises 68 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], 20 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], seven [[Independent (politician)|Independents]] and three [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] members.

Until the [[2009 structural changes to local government in England]], Wiltshire (apart from Swindon) was a two-level county, divided into four local government districts, [[Kennet (district)|Kennet]], [[North Wiltshire]], [[Salisbury (district)|Salisbury]] and [[West Wiltshire]], which existed alongside [[Wiltshire County Council]], covering the same area and carrying out more strategic tasks, such as education and county roads. However, on 1 April 2009 these five local authorities were merged into a single [[unitary authority]] called Wiltshire Council. With the abolition of the District of Salisbury, a new [[Salisbury City Council]] was created at the same time to carry out several citywide functions and to hold the City's charter.

==Sport==
[[File:Kingswoodstand.JPG|thumb|right|The [[County Ground, Swindon]] is the home of [[Swindon Town]], the only football league club in Wiltshire.]]
The county is represented in the [[Football League]] by [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], who play at the [[County Ground, Swindon|County Ground]] stadium near [[Swindon]] town centre. They joined the [[Football League]] on the creation of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in 1920, and have remained in the league ever since. Their most notable achievements include winning the [[Football League Cup]] in 1969 and the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]] in 1970, two successive promotions in 1986 and 1987 (taking them from the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] to the [[Football League Second Division|Second]]), promotion to the [[Premier League]] as [[Football League First Division|Division One]] play-off winners in 1993 (as inaugural members), the Division Two title in 1996, and their promotion to [[Football League One|League One]] in 2007 after finishing third in [[Football League Two|League Two]].

[[Chippenham Town F.C.|Chippenham Town]] are the area's highest ranked non-league football club; they currently play in the [[National League South]] after winning the [[Southern Premier League]] in 2016/17, with a league record points tally of 103. After [[Salisbury City F.C.|Salisbury City]] went into liquidation in 2014, a new club, [[Salisbury F.C.|Salisbury]], was formed and plays in the Southern Premier League.

[[Wiltshire County Cricket Club]] play in the [[Minor Counties]] league.

[[Swindon Robins]] Speedway team, who compete in the top national division, the [[SGB Premiership]], have been at their track at the [[Blunsdon]] Abbey Stadium near Swindon since 1949. [[Swindon Wildcats]] compete in the [[English Premier Ice Hockey League]], the second tier of British ice hockey, and play their home games at Swindon's [[Link Centre]].

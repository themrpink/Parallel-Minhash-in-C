For example,

&lt;code&gt; =NEGBINOMDIST(0, 1, 0.6)&lt;/code&gt; = 0.6

&lt;code&gt;=NEGBINOMDIST(1, 1, 0.6) &lt;/code&gt; = 0.24

Like R, Excel uses the convention that k is the number of failures, so that the number of trials up to and including the first success is k + 1.

[[File:If 196211.jpg|thumb|right|''Podkayne of Mars'' was serialized in ''[[If (magazine)|If]]''.]]

'''''Podkayne of Mars''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]], originally serialised in ''[[Worlds of If]]'' (November 1962, January, March 1963), and published in hardcover in 1963. The novel is about a teenage girl named Podkayne &quot;Poddy&quot; Fries and her asocial younger genius brother, Clark, who leave their home on [[Mars]] to take a trip on a spaceliner to visit [[Earth]], accompanied by their uncle.

==Plot summary==
The book is a first-person narrative consisting of the diary of Podkayne Fries, a 15-year-old (Earth years) girl living on Mars with her parents and 11-year-old brother Clark. Due to the unscheduled &quot;uncorking&quot; (birth) of their three [[In vitro fertilisation|test-tube babies]], Podkayne's parents cancel a much-anticipated trip to Earth. Disappointed, Podkayne confesses her misery to her uncle, Senator Tom Fries, an elder statesman of the Mars government. Tom arranges for Clark and Podkayne, escorted by himself, to get upgraded passage on a luxury liner to Earth.

During boarding, Clark is asked by a customs official  &quot;Anything to declare?&quot; and facetiously answers &quot;Two kilos of happy dust!&quot; As he anticipated, his seemingly flippant remark gets him taken away and searched.  This ploy serves to divert attention away from Podkayne's luggage, where he has hidden a package he was paid to smuggle aboard. Podkayne suspects the reason behind her brother's behavior, but cannot prove it. Clark was told it was a present for the captain, but is far too cynical to be taken in. He later carefully opens the package and finds a nuclear bomb, which he disarms and keeps.

Much of the description of the voyage is based on Heinlein's own experiences as a [[naval officer]] and world traveler. Clark's ploy is taken from a real-life incident, related in Heinlein's ''[[Tramp Royale]]'', in which his wife answers the same question with &quot;heroin&quot; substituted for the fictitious, but equally illegal, happy dust.

Once aboard, they are befriended by &quot;Girdie&quot;, an attractive, capable, experienced woman left impoverished by her late husband. Much to Podkayne's surprise, the normally very self-centered Clark contracts a severe case of [[puppy love]].

Podkayne overhears fellow passengers calling the Frieses &quot;criminals&quot; (Mars had been a convict colony) and &quot;savages&quot; (the Frieses have [[Māori people|Māori]] ancestry).

The liner makes a stop at [[Venus]], which is depicted as a latter-day [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] gone ultra-capitalistic. The planet is controlled by a single corporation; the dream of most of the frantically enterprising residents is to earn enough to buy a single share in it, which guarantees lifelong financial security. Just about anything goes, as long as one can pay for it. The penalty for murder is a fine paid to the corporation for the victim's estimated value plus his projected future earnings. On a less serious level, Heinlein anticipated, by over forty years, television ads in taxicabs (in the book, [[Holography|holographic]]), which have since been implemented in taxicabs in major cities worldwide.

The Frieses are given VIP treatment by the Venus Corporation and Podkayne is escorted by Dexter Cunha, the Chairman's dashing son. She begins to realize that Tom is much more than just her pinochle-playing uncle. When Clark vanishes and even the corporation is unable to find him, Tom reveals that he is on a secret [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] mission, as the accredited representative of the Martian government to a vital conference on Luna (the Moon). The children have been his protective coloration—Tom appearing to be a doddering uncle escorting two young people on a tour of the solar system. Clark has been kidnapped by members of a political faction opposed to Tom.

Podkayne makes an ill-judged attempt to rescue Clark by herself and falls into the kidnappers' clutches as well—only to find her uncle caught too. The captors' scheme is to use the children to blackmail the uncle into doing their bidding at the Luna conference.  They return Uncle Tom to Venusberg after showing him that they have the children.  Clark realizes that once Uncle Tom is released, no matter what happens, their kidnappers will have little reason to keep their prisoners alive. He is prepared, however: he engineers an escape, kills his captors, but forgets to disable the nuclear bomb he had intended to go off only if they failed in their escape.

===Two versions of the ending===
In Heinlein's original ending, Podkayne is killed. This did not please his publisher, who demanded and got a rewrite over the author's bitter objections. In a letter to [[Lurton Blassingame]], his [[literary agent]], Heinlein complained that it would be like &quot;revising Romeo and Juliet to let the young lovers live happily ever after.&quot; He also declared that changing the end &quot;isn't real life, because in real life, not everything ends happily.&quot;

In the original ending, after they escape from the kidnappers to a safe distance, Podkayne remembers that a semi-intelligent Venerian &quot;fairy&quot; baby has been left behind, and returns to rescue it. When the bomb that Clark leaves for the kidnappers blows up, Podkayne is killed, shielding the young fairy with her body. Clark takes over the narrative for the last chapter. The story ends with a hint of hope for him, as he admits his responsibility for what happened to Podkayne—that he &quot;fubbed it, mighty dry&quot;—then shows some human feeling by regretting his inability to cry and describes his plan to raise the fairy himself.

In the revised version, Podkayne is badly injured by the bomb, but not fatally. Uncle Tom, in a phone conversation with Podkayne's father, blames the parents—especially the mother—for neglecting the upbringing of the children. Uncle Tom feels that Clark is dangerous and maladjusted, and attributes this to the mother giving priority to her career. Clark still takes over as the narrator, and, again, regrets that Podkayne was hurt and plans to take care of the fairy, this time because Podkayne will want to see it when she is better.  This is the ending that appeared when the book was published in 1963.

The 1993 Baen edition included both endings (which differ only on the last page) and featured a &quot;pick the ending&quot; contest, in which readers were asked to submit essays on which ending they preferred.  The 1995 edition included both endings, [[Jim Baen]]'s own postlude to the story, and twenty-five of the essays. The ending in which Podkayne dies was declared the winner.  Among the reasons readers favored this ending were that they felt Heinlein should have been free to create his own story, and they believed the changed ending turned a tragedy into a mere adventure, and not a very well constructed one at that.  This ending has appeared in all subsequent editions.

'''''Dark Angel''''' is an American [[science fiction]] [[Drama (genre)|drama]] television series that premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on October 3, 2000. Created by [[James Cameron]] and [[Charles H. Eglee]], it stars [[Jessica Alba]] in her [[breakthrough role]]. Set in 2019, the series chronicles the life of [[Max Guevara]] (Alba), a runaway genetically enhanced [[super-soldier]] who escapes from a covert military facility as a child. In a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[Seattle]], she tries to lead a normal life while eluding capture by government agents and searching for her brothers and sisters scattered in the aftermath of their escape. ''Dark Angel'' was the first and only series produced by the company Cameron/Eglee Productions, and was filmed in Vancouver at [[Lions Gate Studios]].

The high-budget [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] marked Cameron's television debut and was heavily promoted by Fox, reaching 17.4 million viewers. The first season, which was shown on Tuesday nights in the U.S., received mainly positive reviews and won several awards, including the [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for Favorite New TV Drama. Alba's portrayal of Max also received mostly positive reviews and several awards. For the second season, the show was moved to the less desirable air time of [[Friday night death slot|Friday night]] and received some criticism for new plot elements. It suffered from a drop in ratings, averaging 6 million viewers per episode, and was [[cancellation (television)|canceled]].

A series of novels continued the storyline, and a [[Dark Angel (video game)|video game adaptation]] was also released. ''Dark Angel'' is considered to have [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] and [[Women's empowerment|female empowerment]] themes; Max followed a long line of strong female characters in Cameron's work, including [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] and [[Ellen Ripley]]. ''Dark Angel'' is considered to be part of a wave of shows in the late 1990s and early 2000s that feature [[strong female character]]s, alongside ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', and ''[[La Femme Nikita (TV series)|La Femme Nikita]]''.

==Plot==
{{main|List of Dark Angel episodes}}

===Season one===
In February 2009, a genetically enhanced nine-year-old female [[supersoldier]] designated as X5-452 ([[Geneva Locke]]) escapes along with eleven others from a secret U.S. government institution code-named Manticore, where they were born, raised, and trained to be soldiers and [[Assassination|assassins]]. On June 1, 2009, months after X5-452's escape, [[terrorist]]s detonate an [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] weapon in [[Earth's atmosphere|the atmosphere]] over the U.S., which destroys the vast majority of [[computer]] and [[communication]] systems, throwing the country into chaos.

Ten years later in 2019, the now 19-year-old X5-452 ([[Jessica Alba]]), who calls herself Max Guevara, struggles to search for her Manticore brothers and sisters. In the recovering United States, which is now barely more than a [[developing country]], she tries to live a relatively normal life and evade capture by Manticore, which wishes to recover its lost asset. [[List of Dark Angel characters|Logan Cale]] ([[Michael Weatherly]]), an underground cyber-journalist with the alias Eyes Only, attempts to recruit her to help fight corruption in the post-Pulse world. She initially refuses but accepts after Cale is rendered a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] while attempting the assignment he was recruiting her for. A romantic interest buds between the two. While assisting Cale, Max also makes a living as a [[bicycle messenger]] at Jam Pony, a [[courier]] company, along with her friends Original Cindy ([[Valarie Rae Miller]]), Herbal Thought ([[Alimi Ballard]]), and Sketchy ([[Richard Gunn (actor)|Richard Gunn]]). Other X5s are periodically introduced, most significantly the unit leader Zack ([[William Gregory Lee]]). The Manticore hunt for the escaped X5s is led by Colonel Donald Lydecker ([[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]]). Near the end of the season, Lydecker is betrayed by his superior, the even more ruthless Elizabeth Renfro ([[Nana Visitor]]), and he defects from Manticore. He aids Max and Zack in an assault on Manticore headquarters. Max is badly wounded and captured. Zack, who has also been captured, commits suicide to provide Max with his heart, as she needs an X5 [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]] to survive.

===Season two===
Cale exposes Manticore to the world. Renfro decides to burn the facility to cover up the evidence and is killed in the process. Aided by Joshua ([[Kevin Durand]]), a transgenic with [[Canidae|canine]] DNA, Max escapes the facility and frees the other transgenics including [[Alec McDowell|Alec]] ([[Jensen Ackles]]), a fellow X5, who later joins Jam Pony. When Max is reunited with Cale he immediately becomes ill and almost dies. Max discovers that Manticore has infected her with a virus specifically designed to kill Cale, and the two must avoid all physical contact to keep him alive. Max learns that Joshua was the first transgenic created by Sandeman, Manticore's founder. Over the course of the season, it is revealed that a millennia-old breeding cult has bred their own super-soldiers who rival the Manticore-produced transgenics. Ames White ([[Martin Cummins]]), a government agent tasked with eliminating the freed transgenics, is revealed to be a member of the cult. When a strange message written in Max's genetic code makes an appearance on her skin it is revealed that Sandeman is a renegade from the breeding cult and Ames White is his son. White is still loyal to the cult and hates his father's transgenic creations with a passion. Believing that Max is a threat to the breeding cult's plans they attempt to kill her, but she escapes to Terminal City, an abandoned part of Seattle where hundreds of outcast transgenics have been hiding. When the police begin to surround Terminal City Max convinces the other transgenics to stand their ground rather than run. The series ends with the military surrounding Terminal City as the residents raise their newly designed flag from one of the buildings, and wait for a possible invasion.

==Production==

===Background===
[[File:James Cameron by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|alt=James Cameron, a man in his late fifties with white hair, smiling|James Cameron (pictured in 2016) co-created the series with Charles H. Eglee.]]

Following his success with the film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', director [[James Cameron]] teamed up with [[Charles H. Eglee]] with whom he had previously worked on projects including ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]''.{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=57}} The two formed a production company, Cameron/Eglee Productions, and began working on ideas for a television series. They considered several options, including a family drama, before deciding on the idea of ''Dark Angel''. Cameron said they began with the idea that Max would be a genetic construct who &quot;looked normal on the outside but was different on the cellular, genetic level.

''Dark Angel'' would be the first and only work by Cameron/Eglee Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9a093764 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20161014015140/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9a093764 |archive-date=October 14, 2016 |url-status=live |title=Cameron/Eglee Productions |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=October 14, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max followed a long line of strong female characters in Cameron's work, including [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] and [[Ellen Ripley]]. Cameron said &quot;it's a win/win situation&quot; as &quot;women respond to characters who appear strong and capable&quot; and young male audiences &quot;want to see girls kick ass&quot;.&lt;ref name=jay/&gt; Later they decided to set the series in a post-social collapse world,{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=57}} saying that the hysteria surrounding [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K]] served as inspiration; in the series, an [[electromagnetic pulse]] previously destroyed every computer in the United States.{{sfn|Wright, Jr.|2010|page=164}} [[Working title]]s for the series included &quot;Experimental Girl&quot;{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=57}} and &quot;Maximum Girl&quot;.&lt;ref name=tyner/&gt; The project marked Cameron's television debut; he worked mainly as a writer and executive producer for the series.&lt;ref name=jay&gt;{{cite news |last=Bobbin |first=Jay |date=September 29, 2000 |title=James Cameron's &quot;Dark Angel&quot; fights the future in new Fox series |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dP9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4288%2C3054832 |newspaper=[[Boca Raton News]] |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting and filming===
[[File:Jessica Alba SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A portrait shot of Jessica Alba, an attractive woman with long brown hair, smiling|Jessica Alba (pictured in 2014) won the role of Max over more than 1,000 other actresses.]]

More than a thousand young actresses were considered for the part of Max.&lt;ref name=jay/&gt; Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to twenty or thirty applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying &quot;she had her head down, she was reading out of the script&amp;nbsp;... she didn't present herself all that well. But there was something about the way she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked.&quot; Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but kept coming back to Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her.{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=57–58}} Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: &quot;We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backward, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang.&quot; To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.&lt;ref name=storm/&gt;

The two-hour premiere episode cost up to $10 million to produce, and Cameron reportedly &quot;brought the pilot in on time and on budget&quot;.&lt;ref name=jay/&gt; Subsequent episodes had a considerably smaller budget. Fox spent heavily on the promotional campaign for the premiere, paying for theatrical trailers, billboards, and [[guerilla marketing]].&lt;ref name=sandra/&gt; Cameron took a &quot;very basic view&quot; of the show's chance of success, saying: &quot;If it flies, it flies. If it doesn't, it doesn't&amp;nbsp;... If people connect with it, which I hope they will, fine. If we don't find an audience, we deserve to be off the air. It's that simple.&quot;&lt;ref name=jay/&gt; Eglee admitted the series had been &quot;routinely over budget&quot; in the first season, and feared that this would be a factor in whether or not the show was renewed for a second season, though Cameron downplayed these concerns.&lt;ref name=heldenfels&gt;{{cite news |last=Heldenfels |first=R.D. |date=July 21, 2001 |title=Producer Tells of New Plans for 'Dark Angel' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6aZGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3992%2C3309875 |newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston, Maine)|Sun Journal]] |location=Lewiston, Maine |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox &quot;just barely&quot; renewed the series for a second season.{{sfn|Muir|2008|page=244}} The budget for episodes in season two was $1.3 million each.{{sfn|Muir|2008|page=246}} After the intended director of the final episode did not work out, Cameron decided to step in and fill the position. He did this partially for the experience but also to show the network the potential for a third season. It was his first experience directing a TV drama.

The producers were initially told a third season had been approved, but two days later Fox informed them that the series had been canceled.

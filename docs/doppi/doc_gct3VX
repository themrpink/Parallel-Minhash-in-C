The Observatory underwent an attempted bombing on 15 February 1894. This was possibly the first &quot;international terrorist&quot; incident in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|

For major parts of the twentieth century, the Royal Greenwich Observatory was not at Greenwich, because it moved to [[Herstmonceux]] in Sussex in 1957. The last time that all departments were in Greenwich was 1924: in that year electrification of the railways affected the readings of the [[magnetism|Magnetic]] and [[meteorology|Meteorological]] Departments, and the Magnetic Observatory moved to [[Abinger]] in Surrey. Prior to this, the observatory had had to insist that the electric trams in the vicinity could not use an earth return for the traction current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=911 |title=Abinger Magnetic Observatory (1923–1957) |website=The Royal Observatory Greenwich|accessdate= 3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the onset of [[World War II]] in 1939, many departments were temporarily evacuated out of range of German bombers, to Abinger, [[Bradford on Avon]], [[Bristol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=912 |title=Bristol &amp; Bradford on Avon (1939–1948) |website=The Royal Observatory Greenwich|accessdate= 3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=913 |title=Bath (1939–1949) |website=The Royal Observatory Greenwich|accessdate= 3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and activities in Greenwich were reduced to the bare minimum.

On 15 October 1940, during [[the Blitz]], the Courtyard gates were destroyed by a direct bomb hit. The wall above the Gate Clock collapsed, and the clock's dial was damaged. The damage was repaired after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=1085 |title=The Royal Observatory Greenwich – The Shepherd Gate Clock |website=Royal Observatory Greenwich |accessdate= 3 May 2017}} A very detailed history of the Shepherd Gate Clock.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Royal Observatory at Herstmonceux===
[[File:Herstmonceux Observatory aerial view.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, [[Herstmonceux]] site; the dome that formerly housed the [[Isaac Newton Telescope]] is the single dome to the right]]
After the Second World War, in 1947, the decision was made to move the Royal Observatory to [[Herstmonceux Castle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=5 |title=The Herstmonceux years... 1948–1990 |website=The Royal Observatory Greenwich|accessdate= 3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 320 adjacent acres (1.3&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), 70&amp;nbsp;km south-southeast of Greenwich near [[Hailsham]] in East Sussex, due to [[light pollution]] in London. The Observatory was officially known as the ''Royal Greenwich Observatory, Herstmonceux''. Although the [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Harold Spencer Jones]] moved to the castle in 1948, the scientific staff did not move until the observatory buildings were completed, in 1957. Shortly thereafter, other previously dispersed departments were reintegrated at Herstmonceux, such as the [[HM Nautical Almanac Office|Nautical Almanac Office]], Chronometer Department, the library, and observing equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

The largest telescope at Greenwich at that time, the [[Yapp telescope]] 36-inch reflector, was moved out to Herstmonceux in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;the-observatory.org&quot;&gt;[https://www.the-observatory.org/dome-b]&lt;/ref&gt; There it was reconstructed in Dome B of the facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;the-observatory.org&quot;/&gt; There it was used for astronomy in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. It was left behind at Herstmonceux in 1990 in its dome when the organization moved once again.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_JUCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=yapp+moved+to+herstmonceux&amp;pg=PA214|title=General Theory of Light Propagation and Imaging Through the Atmosphere|last=McKechnie|first=T.

The tricentennial of [[Sir Isaac Newton]] had passed during the Second World War, delaying festivities. One of the ground-swells was to build a 'big better' telescope in honour of the celebrated inventor of the Newtonian reflecting telescope. Some two decades of development led to the commissioning of the Isaac Newton Telescope at Herstmonceux. It proved so successful that the cloudy weather was felt to be a bottleneck to its productivity, and plans were made to get it to a higher spot with better weather.

On December 1, 1967, the [[Isaac Newton Telescope]] of the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith_dudley1982&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==The Royal Observatory at Cambridge==
[[File:Greenwich House - geograph.org.uk - 373583.jpg|thumb|Greenwich House at Cambridge]]
In 1990 the Royal Observatory moved from Herstmonceux to a new site at [[Cambridge]], adjacent to the [[University of Cambridge|University]]'s [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]], where it occupied Greenwich House just to the north of the [[Cambridge Observatory]]. By now, the RGO's focus had moved from carrying out observations from the British Isles to  providing technical support, acting as a conduit between scientists in British universities and the powerful British-owned telescopes (such as the [[Isaac Newton Telescope]], the Anglo-Dutch [[Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope]], and the [[William Herschel Telescope]]) on the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/a-closed-subject-1255152.html Charles Arthur, ''A closed subject?''], The Independent, 10 June 1997 (accessed 12 November 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

After abandoning a plan to privatise the RGO and the [[Royal Observatory Edinburgh]], the [[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council]] as the RGO's funding body made the decision to close the institution and the Cambridge site by 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;/&gt; When the RGO was closed as an institution, the [[HM Nautical Almanac Office]] transferred to the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] ([[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]], [[Chilton, Oxfordshire|Chilton]], [[Oxfordshire]]), while other work went to the [[UK Astronomy Technology Centre]] in Edinburgh. The old observatory site at Greenwich returned to its original name  – the Royal Observatory, Greenwich – and was made part of the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{cn|date=August 2020}}

In 2002 the UK joined the [[European Southern Observatory]], building the [[VISTA (telescope)|VISTA infrared telescope]] at the [[Paranal Observatory]] as an in-kind contribution.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

The Astronomer Royal [[Martin Rees]] called PPARC &quot;irresponsible&quot; for how it handled the RGO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15520903-900-times-up-for-the-greenwich-observatory/|title=Time's up for the Greenwich observatory|website=www.newscientist.com|access-date=2019-11-15 | date = 12 July 1997 | last = Motluk | first = Alison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A 14-inch reflector that can take high-resolution images of the sun, moon and planets.
* An instrument dedicated to observing the sun.
* An instrument with interchangeable filters to view distant nebulae at different optical wavelengths.
* A general-purpose telescope.

The telescopes and the works at the site required to operate them cost about £150,000, from grants, museum members and patrons, and public donations.

The telescope was installed in the Altazimuth Pavilion,&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/news/new-telescope-for-royal-observatory-greenwich/|title=New telescope for Royal Observatory Greenwich|website=skyatnightmagazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which the multi-purpose telescope is controlled by a computer system.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

== Magnetic observations ==
[[File:&quot;The Magnetic Pavilion&quot; - Royal Observatory Greenwich ca 1900 (7890151714).jpg|thumb|left|The Magnetic Pavilion, 1900]]
The first magnetic observation was taken in 1680 by the first Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed, using a  magnetic needle from the Royal Society.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=1996QJRAS..37...65M Page 65|journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume = 37|pages = 65|bibcode = 1996QJRAS..37...65M|last1 = Malin|first1 = S. R. C.|year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third Astronomers Royal, [[Edmond Halley]] and then James Bradley, also took some magnetic measurements during their tenure.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

In the 19th century George Airy established the Magnetical and Meteorological Department.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

The first Magnetic House was built next to the observatory but by 1900 a second, about 300–400 metres from the main observatory, was built to reduce magnetic interference.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=adA0AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=magnetic+pavilion+built+greenwich&amp;pg=RA2-PR2|title=Observations Made at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in the Year ... in Astronomy, Magnetism and Meteorology|date=1921|publisher=H.M.

One of the special events that occurred in the study of magnetism was when [[François Arago]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]] took magnetic observations at Greenwich in 1822.&lt;ref name=&quot;1986JBAA...97...26H Page 26&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=1986JBAA...97...26H Page 26|journal = Journal of the British Astronomical Association|volume = 97|pages = 26|bibcode = 1986JBAA...97...26H|last1 = Howard-Duff|first1 = I.|year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825 Arago won the [[Copley Medal|Copley Gold Medal]] for this research&lt;ref name=&quot;1986JBAA...97...26H Page 26&quot;/&gt; (see also [[Arago's rotations]]).

==Observatory museum==
[[File:Royal observatory Greenwich.JPG|thumb|Tourists flock to the Observatory museum, 2009]]

The observatory buildings at Greenwich became a museum of astronomical and navigational tools, which is part of the Royal Museums Greenwich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/|title=Royal Museums Greenwich : Sea, Ships, Time and the Stars : RMG|date=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable exhibits include [[John Harrison]]'s [[marine chronometer|sea watch]], [[John Harrison#H4|the H4]], which received a large reward from the [[Board of Longitude]], and his three earlier marine timekeepers; all four are the property of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. Many additional horological artefacts are displayed, documenting the history of precision timekeeping for navigational and astronomical purposes, including the mid-20th-century Russian-made F.M. Fedchenko clock (the most accurate pendulum clock ever built in multiple copies). It also houses the astronomical instruments used to make meridian observations and the 28-inch equatorial [[Howard Grubb|Grubb]] [[refracting telescope]] of 1893, the largest of its kind in the UK. The [[Shepherd Gate Clock|Shepherd Clock]] outside the observatory gate is an early example of an [[Clock#Synchronized or slave clocks|electric slave clock]].{{cn|date=August 2020}}

In 1997 the observatory site was getting 400,000 visitors per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masood|first=Ehsan|date=1997-08-01|title=Royal observatory could return to Greenwich site|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=388|issue=6644|pages=705|doi=10.1038/41849|issn=1476-4687|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005 a £16&amp;nbsp;million redevelopment comprising a new [[planetarium]] and additional display galleries and educational facilities was started; the ROG reopened on 25 May 2007 with the new 120-seat [[Peter Harrison Planetarium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/work-services/news-press/press-release/reopening-new-royal-observatory-greenwich |title=Press Release: Reopening of the new Royal Observatory, Greenwich |website=Royal Museums Greenwich |date=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is now Charing Cross road was originally two narrow streets in the West End, Crown Street and Castle Street. The development of [[Regent Street]] (parallel to the west) in the mid-18th century coincided with not only the building up of great fields west of the area but also [[Westminster Bridge]] which was built as central London and the wider estuary's second bridge after more than a century of pressure, in 1750.

These pressures therefore congested the north–south axis of the inner West End almost as much as the relieved London Bridge area.  Specifically a major increase in traffic occurred around [[Piccadilly Circus]], [[Charing Cross]] and Oxford Street, much of it destined from/to [[Tottenham Court Road]], [[Bloomsbury]] and nearby routes to all northerly directions.

Charing Cross Road was therefore developed, in conjunction with [[Shaftesbury Avenue]], by the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] under an 1877 [[Act of Parliament]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=149}} The Act's total costs, including demolition and rebuilding of many rows of buildings across London was £778,238. The two streets and others such as the [[Thames Embankment]], [[Northumberland Avenue]] and the [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]]-[[Aldwych]] superstructure were built to improve traffic flow through central London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Buildings of England]]|volume=6: Westminster|year=2003|first=Simon|last=Bradley|first2=Nikolaus|last2=Pevsner|p=401|isbn=0-300-09595-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme abolished some of the worst slums in London which delayed progress in construction while they were rehoused.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=149}}

The new road met the disapprobation of [[Mervyn Edmund Macartney|Mervyn Macartney]] who said of it in an 1899 article: &quot;Perhaps the worst is Charing Cross Road. It has no beginning and no end. Amorphous, hideous in its tortuous course, it is a monument of the ineptitude, parsimony, and incompetence of its creators.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Architectural Review|volume=6|date=June–December 1899|title=From Holborn to the Strand: An Ideal Street|pages=[https://archive.org/details/architecturalrev06unse/page/239 239]-244|url=https://archive.org/details/architecturalrev06unse|first=Mervyn Edmund|last=Macartney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bookshops==
{{see also|Book trade in the United Kingdom}}
Charing Cross Road is renowned for its specialist and second-hand [[bookshop]]s. The section from [[Leicester Square tube station|Leicester Square Underground station]] to [[Cambridge Circus, London|Cambridge Circus]] is home to specialist bookshops, and more general second-hand and antiquarian shops such as [[Quinto Bookshop]], Henry Pordes and Any Amount of Books. Smaller second-hand and specialist antiquarian bookshops can be found on the adjoining [[Cecil Court]].

The northern section between Cambridge Circus and Oxford Street includes more generalist bookshops such as the venerable [[Foyles]]. A long-standing correspondence between [[New York City]]-based author [[Helene Hanff]] and the staff of a bookshop on the street, Marks &amp; Co., was the inspiration for the book ''[[84, Charing Cross Road]]'' (1970). The book was made into a [[84 Charing Cross Road (film)|1987 film]] starring [[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]] and also into a play and a [[BBC]] radio drama. 84 Charing Cross Road, located just north of Cambridge Circus,  has not been a bookshop for many years; at street level it is now a restaurant (entered round the corner in Cambridge Circus), but the upper levels of the building remain as originally constructed.  A small brass plaque, noted by Hanff in her book &quot;Q's Legacy&quot;, remains on the stone pilaster facing Charing Cross Road.

==Features==
The music venue the [[London Astoria|Astoria]] was located here, as is one of the sites of [[St Martin's Arts College]], opening in 1939.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=149}} To the northeast of Charing Cross Road are the music shops on [[Denmark Street]] (known as Britain's [[Tin Pan Alley]]).{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=134}}

A number of theatres are on or near Charing Cross Road, such as the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] (which has its entrance on the adjoining Phoenix Street), the [[Garrick Theatre]] and [[Wyndham's Theatre]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=149}}

Beneath the grille in the traffic island between Charing Cross Road's junction with [[Old Compton Street]], in the middle of the road, the old road signs for the now-vanished Little Compton Street can be seen. This road once joined [[Old Compton Street]] with New Compton Street.

On the east side of the road's southern end, at the joining of [[St Martins Lane]], is a statue of [[Edith Cavell]]. Towards the north end is the [[Phoenix Garden]] – an environmental garden run by local residents.

In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' books, the [[Places in Harry Potter#The Leaky Cauldron|Leaky Cauldron]] pub is located on Charing Cross Road. However, on screen, the locations used are Chez Michelle, a florist in [[Borough Market]], for the exterior in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' and the Glass House, an optician in [[Leadenhall Market]], for the entrance in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''. Most interior filming was done on set.&lt;ref&gt;The location of The Leaky Cauldron is implied in the earlier books but stated explicitly in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''; Chapter 26, page 423 Bloomsbury Edition, states &quot;...He opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn's existence.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Richard|title=Harry Potter Film Locations - London Gallery|url=http://www.the-magician.co.uk/harry-potter-film-locations.htm|website=Richard Jones's Free Harry Potter London Tour|publisher=Richard Jones|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

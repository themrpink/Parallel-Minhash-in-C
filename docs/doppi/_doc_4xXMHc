Besides this classical case, various papers in historical linguistics have employed Thai for comparative purposes in studying the linguistic landscape of the ancient region of Southern China. Proto-reconstructions of some scattered non-Sinitic words found in the two ancient Chinese fictional texts, ''Mu tianzi zhuan'' 穆天子傳 (4th c. B.C.) and ''Yuejue shu'' 越絕書 (1st c. A.D.), are used to compare to Thai/Siamese and its related languages in [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai language family]] in an attempt to identify the origins of those words. The following examples are cited from Wolfgang Behr's work (2002):

&quot;The [[Wu (state)|Wú]] say ''yī'' for 'good' and ''huăn'' for 'way', i.e. in their titles they follow the central kingdoms, but in their names they follow their own lords.&quot;

==Varieties and related languages==
According to Ethnologue, Thai language is spoken by over 20&amp;nbsp;million people (2000). Moreover, most Thais in the northern and the northeastern (Isaan) parts of the country today are bilingual speakers of Central Thai and their respective regional dialects due to the fact that (Central) Thai is the language of television, education, news reporting, and all forms of media.&lt;ref name=bangkok&gt;{{cite web

===Related languages===
{{main|Southwestern Tai languages}}
*[[Isan language|Isan]] (Northeastern Thai), the language of the [[Isan]] region of Thailand, a collective term for the various [[Lao language|Lao]] dialects spoken in Thailand that show some Central Thai influences, which used to be written with Laotian scripts ([[Isan language#Tai Noi alphabet|Tai Noi]]) and [[Tai Tham script|Tai Tham]], as well as Old Cambodian (see [[Khmer script]]) and is now written with the [[Thai script]]. It is spoken by about 20&amp;nbsp;million people. Thais from both inside and outside the Isan region often simply call this variant &quot;Lao&quot; when speaking informally.
*[[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]] (Phasa Nuea, Lanna, Kam Mueang, or [[Thai Yuan]]), which was originally written in [[Tai Tham script|Tai Tham]] and is spoken by about 6&amp;nbsp;million (1983) in the formerly independent kingdom of [[Lanna]] ([[Chiang Mai]]).

*[[Song language|Song]], spoken by about 30,000 in central and northern Thailand (2000).

===Registers===
Central Thai is composed of several distinct [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], forms for different social contexts:
*Street or Common Thai ({{wiktth|ภาษาพูด}}, ''phasa phut'', spoken Thai): informal, without polite terms of address, as used between close relatives and friends.
*Elegant or Formal Thai ({{wiktth|ภาษาเขียน}}, ''phasa khian'', written Thai): official and written version, includes respectful terms of address; used in simplified form in newspapers.
*Rhetorical Thai: used for public speaking.
*Religious Thai: (heavily influenced by [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]]) used when discussing Buddhism or addressing monks.
*Royal Thai (ราชาศัพท์, ''racha sap''): influenced by [[Khmer language|Khmer]], this is used when addressing members of the [[Royal Family of Thailand|royal family]] or describing their activities. (See {{section link|Monarchy of Thailand|Rachasap}}.)

Most Thais can speak and understand all of these contexts. Street and Elegant Thai are the basis of all conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/TH-language.htm|title=The Languages spoken in Thailand|website=Studycountry|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Rhetorical, religious, and royal Thai are taught in schools as part of the national curriculum.

==Script==
{{main|Thai script|Thai braille}}

Thai is written in the [[Thai script]], an [[abugida]] written from left to right. Many scholars believe{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} that it is derived from the [[Khmer script]]. Certainly the numbers were lifted directly from Khmer. The language and its script are closely related to the [[Lao language]] and [[Lao script|script]]. Most literate Lao are able to read and understand Thai, as more than half of the Thai vocabulary, grammar, intonation, vowels and so forth are common with the Lao language.

The Thais adopted and modified the Khmer script to create their own writing system. While in Thai the pronunciation can largely be inferred from the script, the orthography is complex, with silent letters to preserve original spellings and many letters representing the same sound. While the oldest known inscription in the [[Khmer language]] dates from 611 CE, inscriptions in Thai writing began to appear around 1292 CE. Notable features include:

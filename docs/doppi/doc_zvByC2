Differential schemes for other PSK modulations may be devised along similar lines. The waveforms for DPSK are the same as for differentially encoded PSK given above since the only change between the two schemes is at the receiver.

The BER curve for this example is compared to ordinary BPSK on the right. As mentioned above, whilst the error rate is approximately doubled, the increase needed in &lt;math&gt;E_b/N_0&lt;/math&gt; to overcome this is small.  The increase in &lt;math&gt;E_b/N_0&lt;/math&gt; required to overcome differential modulation in coded systems, however, is larger{{snd}} typically about 3&amp;nbsp;dB. The performance degradation is a result of [[noncoherent transmission]]{{snd}} in this case it refers to the fact that tracking of the phase is completely ignored.

==Mutual information with additive white Gaussian noise==
[[File:PSK Mutual Information in AWGN.svg|300px|right|thumb|Mutual information of PSK over the AWGN channel]]

The [[mutual information]] of PSK can be evaluated in [[additive white Gaussian noise|additive Gaussian noise]] by [[numerical integration]] of its definition.&lt;ref name=Blahut1988&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blahut|first1=R. E.|title=Principles and Practice of Information Theory|date=1988|publisher=Addison Wesley Publishing Company|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=0-201-10709-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curves of mutual information saturate to the number of bits carried by each symbol in the limit of infinite signal to noise ratio &lt;math&gt;E_s/N_0&lt;/math&gt;. On the contrary, in the limit of small signal to noise ratios the mutual information approaches the [[Shannon–Hartley theorem|AWGN channel capacity]], which is the supremum among all possible choices of symbol statistical distributions. 

At intermediate values of signal to noise ratios the mutual information (MI) is well approximated by:&lt;ref name=Blahut1988 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{MI} \simeq \log_2\left(\sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{e}\frac{E_s}{N_0}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The mutual information of PSK over the AWGN channel is generally farther to the AWGN channel capacity than [[Quadrature amplitude modulation#Mutual Information with AWGN|QAM]] modulation formats.

'''Photocurrent''' is the [[electric current]] through a [[photosensitive]] device, such as a [[photodiode]], as the result of exposure to [[radiant power]].  The photocurrent may occur as a result of the [[photoelectric]], photoemissive, or [[photovoltaic effect]].  The photocurrent may be enhanced by internal [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] caused by interaction among ions and photons under the influence of applied fields, such as occurs in an [[avalanche photodiode]] (APD).

When a suitable radiation is used, the photoelectric current is directly proportional to intensity of radiation and increases with the increase in [[Potential|accelerating potential]] till the stage is reached when photo-current becomes maximum and does not increase with further increase in accelerating potential. The highest (maximum) value of the photo-current is called [[saturation current]]. The value of retarding potential at which photo-current becomes zero is called [[Cutoff voltage|cut-off voltage]] or stopping potential for the given frequency of the incident ray.

==Photovoltaics==
{{main|Theory of solar cells}}
The generation of a photocurrent forms the basis of the [[photovoltaic cell]].

==Photocurrent spectroscopy==
A characterization technique called '''photocurrent spectroscopy''' ('''PCS'''), also known as '''photoconductivity spectroscopy''', is widely used for studying optoelectronic properties of semiconductors and other light absorbing materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSC-def&quot;&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/prospect/ontology.asp?id=CMO:0002602&amp;MSID=C2JM15027A |title=RSC Definition - Photocurrent spectroscopy |last= |first= |date= |website=RSC |publisher= |access-date=2020-07-19 |quote=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The setup of the technique involves having a semiconductor contacted with electrodes allowing for application of an electric bias, while at the same time a tunable light source incident with a given specific wavelength (energy) and power, usually pulsed by a mechanical chopper.&lt;ref name=&quot;QW-PCS&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  

The quantity measured is the electrical response of the circuit, coupled with the spectrograph obtained by varying the incident light energy by a [[monochromator]].  The circuit and optics are coupled by use of a [[lock-in amplifier]]. The measurements give information related to the band gap of the semiconductor, allowing for identification of various charge transitions like [[exciton]] and [[trion]] energies. This is highly relevant for studying semiconductor nanostructures like quantum wells,&lt;ref&gt;

Furthermore, by using a piezo stage to vary the lateral position of the semiconductor with micron precision, one can generate a micrograph false color image of the spectra for different positions.  This is called '''scanning photocurrent microscopy''' ('''SPCM''').&lt;ref&gt;

      <text bytes="15224" xml:space="preserve">[[File:Pin-Diode.svg|thumb|Layers of a PIN diode]]
A '''PIN diode''' is a [[diode]] with a wide, undoped [[intrinsic semiconductor]] region between a [[p-type semiconductor]] and an [[n-type semiconductor]] region. The p-type and n-type regions are typically heavily [[doping (semiconductor)|doped]] because they are used for [[ohmic contact]]s.

The wide intrinsic region is in contrast to an ordinary [[p–n diode]]. The wide intrinsic region makes the PIN diode an inferior [[rectifier]] (one typical function of a diode), but it makes it suitable for attenuators, fast switches, photodetectors, and high-voltage power electronics applications.

== Operation ==

A PIN diode operates under what is known as '''high-level injection'''. In other words, the intrinsic &quot;i&quot; region is flooded with charge carriers from the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;n&quot; regions.  Its function can be likened to filling up a water bucket with a hole on the side.  Once the water reaches the hole's level it will begin to pour out. Similarly, the diode will conduct current once the flooded electrons and holes reach an equilibrium point, where the number of electrons is equal to the number of holes in the intrinsic region. When the diode is [[p–n diode#Forward bias|forward biased]], the injected carrier concentration is typically several orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic carrier concentration. Due to this high level injection, which in turn is due to the [[depletion region|depletion process]], the electric field extends deeply (almost the entire length) into the region. This electric field helps in speeding up of the transport of charge carriers from the P to the N region, which results in faster operation of the diode, making it a suitable device for high-frequency operation.

== Characteristics ==

The PIN diode obeys the standard diode equation for low-frequency signals. At higher frequencies, the diode looks like an almost perfect (very linear, even for large signals) resistor. The P-I-N diode has a relatively large stored charge adrift in a thick [[intrinsic semiconductor|intrinsic region]]. At a low-enough frequency, the stored charge can be fully swept and the diode turns off. At higher frequencies, there is not enough time to sweep the charge from the drift region, so the diode never turns off. The time required to sweep the stored charge from a diode junction is its [[diode#Reverse-recovery effect|reverse recovery time]], and it is relatively long in a PIN diode. For a given semiconductor material, on-state impedance, and minimum usable RF frequency, the reverse recovery time is fixed. This property can be exploited; one variety of P-I-N diode, the [[step recovery diode]], exploits the abrupt impedance change at the end of the reverse recovery to create a narrow impulse waveform useful for [[frequency multiplier|frequency multiplication]] with high multiples.

The high-frequency resistance is inversely proportional to the DC bias current through the diode. A PIN diode, suitably biased, therefore acts as a variable resistor. This high-frequency resistance may vary over a wide range (from {{nowrap|0.1 Ω}} to {{nowrap|10 kΩ}} in some cases;&lt;ref name=&quot;PDFun&quot;&gt;{{Citation |first=Bill |last=Doherty |url=https://www.microsemi.com/sites/default/files/micnotes/701.pdf |title=MicroNotes: PIN Diode Fundamentals |location=Watertown, MA |publisher=Microsemi Corp. |id=MicroNote Series 701}}&lt;/ref&gt; the useful range is smaller, though).

The wide intrinsic region also means the diode will have a low capacitance when [[p–n diode#Reverse bias|reverse-biased]].

In a PIN diode the depletion region exists almost completely within the intrinsic region. This depletion region is much larger than in a PN diode and almost constant-size, independent of the reverse bias applied to the diode. This increases the volume where electron-hole pairs can be generated by an incident photon. Some [[photodetector]] devices, such as PIN photodiodes and phototransistors (in which the base-collector junction is a PIN diode), use a PIN junction in their construction.

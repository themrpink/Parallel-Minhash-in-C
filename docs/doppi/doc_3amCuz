The '''Strait of Juan de Fuca''' (officially named '''Juan de Fuca Strait''' in Canada&lt;ref name=bcgnis&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=25888 |title=Juan de Fuca Strait}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a body of water about {{convert|96|mi|nmi km}} long&lt;ref name=gnis&gt;{{gnis|1526614|Strait of Juan de Fuca}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is the [[Salish Sea]]'s outlet to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Canada–United States border|international boundary]] between [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]  runs down the centre of the Strait.

It was named in 1787 by the [[maritime fur trade]]r [[Charles William Barkley]], captain of ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]'', for [[Juan de Fuca]], the Greek navigator who sailed in a Spanish expedition in 1592 to seek the fabled [[Strait of Anián]]. Barkley was the first non-indigenous person to find the strait, unless Juan de Fuca's story was true.&lt;ref&gt;While {{gnis|1526614|Strait of Juan de Fuca}} says John Meares named the strait in 1788, most sources say it was Barkley in 1787, for example: {{Cite bcgnis|id=25888 |title=Juan de Fuca Strait}}; [http://www.secstate.wa.gov/History/timeline_detail.aspx?s=1540&amp;e=9 Existence of the Strait of Juan de Fuca confirmed by Captain Charles Barkley], Washington Secretary of State; {{cite book |last= Hayes |first= Derek |title= Historical Atlas of the Pacific Northwest: Maps of exploration and Discovery |year= 1999 |publisher= Sasquatch Books |isbn= 1-57061-215-3|pages= 16}} online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=sl57oHrVXGoC Google Books]; and {{cite book |last= Pethick |first= Derek |title= The Nootka Connection: Europe and the Northwest Coast 1790–1795 |url= https://archive.org/details/nootkaconnection0000peth |url-access= registration |year= 1980 |publisher= Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location= Vancouver |isbn= 0-88894-279-6 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/nootkaconnection0000peth/page/24 24]}} It is well established that Meares tried to take credit for much of Barkley's work.&lt;/ref&gt; The strait was explored in detail between 1789 and 1791 by [[Manuel Quimper]], [[José María Narváez]], [[Juan Carrasco (explorer)|Juan Carrasco]], [[Gonzalo López de Haro]], and [[Francisco de Eliza]].

==Definition==
The [[United States Geological Survey]] defines the Strait of Juan de Fuca as a [[Channel (geography)|channel]].  It extends east from the Pacific Ocean between [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]], and the [[Olympic Peninsula]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], to [[Haro Strait]], San Juan Channel, [[Rosario Strait]], and [[Puget Sound]].  The Pacific Ocean boundary is formed by a line between [[Cape Flattery (Washington)|Cape Flattery]] and [[Tatoosh Island]], Washington, and Carmanah Point (Vancouver Island), British Columbia. Its northern boundary follows the shoreline of Vancouver Island from Carmanah Point to Gonzales Point, then follows a continuous line east to Seabird Point ([[Discovery Island (British Columbia)|Discovery Island]]), British Columbia, Cattle Point ([[San Juan Island]]), Washington, [[Iceberg Point]] ([[Lopez Island]]), Point Colville (Lopez Island), and then to Rosario Head ([[Fidalgo Island]]). The eastern boundary runs south from Rosario Head across [[Deception Pass]] to [[Whidbey Island]], then along the western coast of Whidbey Island to [[Point Partridge]], then across [[Admiralty Inlet]] to [[Point Wilson]] ([[Quimper Peninsula]]). The northern coast of the [[Olympic Peninsula]]  forms the southern boundary of the strait.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt; In the eastern entrance to the Strait, the Race Rocks Archipelago is located in the high current zone halfway between Port Angeles, Washington, and Victoria, BC.

==Climate==
[[Image:Strait of San Juan de Fuca sunset.jpg|thumb|right|Sunset over the strait]]
Like the rest of the Salish Sea and surrounding regions, the climate of the Strait is disputed, with the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]] classifying it as [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], but most regional climatologists preferring [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. While the climate is mostly oceanic in nature, the dry summers result in the Mediterranean classification in the Köppen system. Rainfall ranges from over {{convert|100|in|cm}} ([[temperate rainforest]]) conditions at the west end to as little as {{convert|16|in|mm}} at the east end, near [[Sequim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEQUIM 2 E, WASHINGTON|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?wa7544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is exposed to the generally westerly winds and waves of the Pacific, seas and weather in Juan de Fuca Strait are, on average, rougher than in the more protected waters inland, thereby resulting in a number of [[Small-craft advisory|small-craft advisories]].

== Ferries ==
An international [[M/V Coho|vehicle ferry]] crosses the Strait from [[Port Angeles, Washington]] to [[Victoria, British Columbia]] several times each day, as do passenger ferries of the [[Washington State Ferry]] system, a seasonal [[Victoria Express|private ferry]] connecting Port Angeles with Victoria, and a private high-speed ferry between Victoria and [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]].

==Boundary dispute==
[[File:The Olympian Range, from Esquimalt (HS85-10-11325).jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Olympic Mountains]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] as seen from the entrance to [[Esquimalt Harbour]], 1900, photo: [[John Wallace Jones]]]]This strait remains the subject of a maritime boundary dispute between Canada and the United States. The dispute is only over the seaward boundary extending {{convert|200|nmi|km}} west from the mouth of the strait. The maritime boundary within the strait is not in dispute. Both governments have proposed a boundary based on the [[Equidistance principle|principle of equidistance]], but with different basepoint selections, resulting in small differences in the line. Resolution of the issue should be simple, but has been hindered because it might influence [[:Category:Canada–United States border disputes|other unresolved]] maritime boundary issues between Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Charney |first= Jonathan I. |author2=David A.

British Columbia's position is based on the [[Natural prolongation principle|principle of natural prolongation]] which developed in [[international law]]. It poses a dilemma for the federal government of Canada. If Canada holds that the principle of natural prolongation applies to the Juan de Fuca Canyon on its [[Pacific Ocean]] coast, the assertion could undermine Canada's argument in the [[Machias Seal Island#Gulf of Maine boundary|''Gulf of Maine'' boundary dispute]]. In this [[Atlantic Ocean]] context, Canada favours an outcome based on the principle of equidistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McRae |first= Donald Malcolm |author2=Gordon Ross Munro  |title= Canadian Oceans Policy: National Strategies and the New Law of the Sea |year= 1989 |publisher= UBC Press |isbn= 978-0-7748-0346-5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IFVH8zKQAzkC&amp;pg=PA151 |pages= 151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Johnston |first= Douglas M. |author2=Mark J.

==Salish Sea==
{{main|Salish Sea}}
In March 2008, the [[Chemainus First Nation]] proposed renaming the strait the &quot;[[Salish Sea]]&quot;, an idea that reportedly met with approval by British Columbia's Aboriginal Relations Minister [[Mike de Jong]], who pledged to put it before the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|B.C. cabinet]] for discussion. Making ''Salish Sea'' official required a formal application to the [[Geographical Names Board of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Strait of Georgia could be renamed Salish Sea |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/strait-of-georgia-could-be-renamed-salish-sea-1.773346 |work=Canadian Press |publisher=CBC.ca |date=2008-03-09 |accessdate=2008-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel American movement promoting the name had a different definition, combining of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and [[Puget Sound]] as well as the Strait of Georgia and related waters under the more general name ''Salish Sea''.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Macdonald Stewart, 2017. Views of the Salish Sea: One Hundred and Fifty Years of Change around the Strait of Georgia. Harbour Publishing Company Limited. pp. 13–15. {{ISBN|978-1-55017-804-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This latter definition was made official in 2009 by geographic boards of Canada and the United States.

In October 2009, the Washington State Board of Geographic Names approved the Salish Sea [[Toponymy|toponym]], not to replace the names of the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and Strait of Juan de Fuca, but instead as a collective term for all three.&lt;ref name=adoption&gt;{{cite web | date =2009-10-30 | url =http://www.dnr.wa.gov/ResearchScience/News/Pages/nr09_177.aspx | title =STATE BOARD ON GEOGRAPHIC NAMES APPROVES 'SALISH SEA' | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131030002600/http://www.dnr.wa.gov/ResearchScience/News/Pages/nr09_177.aspx | archive-date =2013-10-30 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Columbia Geographical Names Office passed a resolution only recommending that the name be adopted by the [[Geographical Names Board of Canada]], should its US counterpart approve the name-change.&lt;ref name=&quot;adoption&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.straight.com/article-268225/washington-state-adopts-salish-sea-name-body-water-including-strait-georgia ''Washington state adopts “Salish Sea” name for body of water including Strait of Georgia'', Carlito Pablo, ''Georgia Straight'', October 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berger|first=Knute|authorlink=Knute Berger|title=Smooth Sailing for the Salish Sea?|date=October 20, 2009|work=[[Crosscut.com|Crosscut]]|url=http://crosscut.com/blog/crosscut/19058/|access-date=August 13, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105034831/http://crosscut.com/blog/crosscut/19058/ |archive-date=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] approved the name on November 12, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berger|first=Knute|authorlink=Knute Berger|title=U.S. approves Salish Sea name|date=November 12, 2009|work=[[Crosscut.com|Crosscut]]|url=http://crosscut.com/blog/crosscut/19183/|access-date=August 13, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227141029/http://crosscut.com/blog/crosscut/19183/ |archive-date=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spellevator''''' is an [[educational computer game]] for the [[Apple II]] published by [[MECC]] in 1988.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:SpellevatorScreenshotAppleII.png|thumb|Screenshot]]

The player controls a [[dust bunny]], which is chased by several [[vacuum cleaners]] with different movement patterns. The objective of the level is to grab all the letters and exit through the upper left corner. The player can pass through an unoccupied elevator (some vacuum cleaners use elevators also) by correctly answering a spelling or vocabulary question. Once one completes a level, the player can receive a bonus by correctly unscrambling the letters one grabbed into a word).

''Spellevator'' has a utility on the disk's flipside that let a user create a word list and save it to any [[ProDOS]] formatted floppy disk. This way, teachers could customize the game to fit their own particular vocabulary lists.

==Legacy==
''Spellevator'' was followed by ''Spellevator Plus'' for additional platforms.

{{about||the Bobbie Gentry album|Patchwork (album)}}
[[File:Korea-Joseon-Bojagi-01.jpg|thumb|Traditional Korean patchwork [[pojagi]] wrapping cloth]]
'''Patchwork''' or &quot;'''pieced work'''&quot; is a form of [[needlework]] that involves sewing together pieces of [[Cloth|fabric]] into a larger design. The larger design is usually based on repeating patterns built up with different fabric shapes (which can be different colors). These shapes are carefully measured and cut, basic [[geometric shape]]s making them easy to piece together. 
[[Image:N2 midnight sun.jpg|thumb|right|Example of patchwork]]

==Uses==
[[Image:Little amsterdam.jpg|thumb|A patchwork representing Little Amsterdam]]
Patchwork is most often used to make [[quilts]], but it can also be used to make [https://southernhides.com/cowhide-patchwork-rugs/ rugs], bags, wall-hangings, warm [[jacket]]s, cushion covers, [[skirt]]s, waistcoats and other items of [[clothing]]. Some textile artists work with patchwork, often combining it with [[embroidery]] and other forms of [[stitchery]].

When used to make a [[quilt]], this larger patchwork or pieced design becomes the &quot;top&quot; of a three-layered quilt, the middle layer being the batting and the bottom layer the backing. To keep the batting from shifting, a patchwork or pieced quilt is often [[quilting|quilted]] by hand or [[sewing machine|machine]] using a running stitch in order to outline the individual shapes that make up the pieced top, or the quilting stitches may be random or highly ordered overall patterns that contrast with the patchwork composition.

==History==
[[File:Jogakbo jeogori and norigae.jpg|thumb|Woman wearing a traditional [[jeogori]] (jacket) made with ''Jogakbo'', or Korean patchwork]]
Evidence of patchwork—piecing small pieces of fabric together to create a larger piece and quilting layers of textile fabrics together—has been found throughout history. Patchwork was used by ancient Egyptians for their clothes, wall decorations, draperies and furniture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Beginnings of Quilting and Patchwork in Antiquity - Two Articles on the History of the Craft |date=2016 |publisher=Read Books Ltd |isbn=9781473355132}}&lt;/ref&gt; with oldest depictions from 5,500 years ago (3,400 BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;allaboutquilts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Quilt History |url=https://www.all-about-quilts.com/quilt-history.html |website=All About Quilts |accessdate=March 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese patchwork]] is storied to have begun by emperor Liu Yu of the [[Liu Song Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Aqiusha |title=百家衣的由來 (Origin of Baijia yi) |url=http://www.43911.com/t/fushijichu/fsjc/1333464552.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118171229/https://www.43911.com/t/fushijichu/fsjc/1333464552.shtml |archivedate=November 18, 2015 |date=2014-04-03 |accessdate=February 11, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earliest preserved pieces have been dated from the early [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name=&quot;allaboutquilts&quot;/&gt; where among other uses layers of quilted fabric were used in the construction of armor—this kept the soldiers warm and protected. Japanese armor was made in a similar fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianart.org/collections/conservation-of-japanese-armor|title=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Conservation of Japanese Armor|website=www.asianart.org|access-date=2020-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this technique, quilts began to appear in households of the 11th to 13th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.connectingcultures.us/resources/artifacts/art_item.php?accno1=DECO&amp;accno2=USA&amp;accno3=235|title=Connecting Cultures Mobile Museum - Collection - US Hawaiian Quilt: &quot;'Ulu&quot; Design|website=www.connectingcultures.us|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the European climate became colder around this time, the incidence of the use of bed quilts rose, and so developed the practice of embellishing a simple cloth through the creation of pattern and design, alongside the development of decorative quilting. The tradition of making quilts in this fashion was taken to America by the Pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Page, ''The History of Patchwork and Quilting'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Patchwork enjoyed a widespread revival during the [[Great Depression]] as a way to recycle worn clothing into warm quilts. Even very small and worn pieces of material are suitable for use in patchwork, although crafters today more often use new 100% [[cotton]] fabrics as the basis for their designs. In the US, patchwork declined after [[World War II]] but was again revived during the [[United States|American]] bicentennial. In the past, hand quilting was often done in a group around a frame. Instead of quilting, the layers are sometimes tied together at regular intervals with pieces of yarn, a practice known as tying or knotting, and which produces a &quot;comforter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womenfolk.com/quilting_history/quilting.htm Hand quilting]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Popularity ====
The 2003 Quilting in America survey estimated that the total value of the American quilting industry was $2.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quiltersvillage.com/QIA2003.pdf Quilting in America 2003 edition]&lt;/ref&gt; International quilting exhibitions attract thousands of visitors, while countless smaller exhibitions are held every weekend in local regions. Active cyber-quilting communities abound on the web; books and magazines on the subject are published in the hundreds every year; and there are many active local quilting guilds and shops in different countries. &quot;Quilt Art&quot; is established as a legitimate artistic medium, with quilted works of art selling for thousands of dollars to corporate buyers and [[art gallery|galleries]]. Quilt historians and quilt appraisers are re-evaluating the heritage of traditional quilting and antique quilts, while superb examples of antique quilts are purchased for large sums by [[Collecting|collectors]] and [[museum]]s. The American Quilt Study Group is active in promotion of research on the [[history of quilting]].

In Indian stitching blanket using different small pieces of cloth is an art. It is popularly known as Kaudhi in Karnataka. Such blankets are given as gifts to newborn babies in some parts of Karnataka. [[Lambani]] tribes wear skirts with such art.

Patchwork is also done in various parts of Pakistan, especially in the Sindh region, where they call it ''ralli''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralli quilt]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=April 2018}} Pakistani ''ralli'' quilts are famous all over the subcontinent even in the west. These quilts are a part of their tradition and are made by women. Now these are gaining international recognition even though they have been making them for thousands of years.

==Structure==
There are three traditional structures used to construct a patchwork or pieced composition: 1) the block, 2) overall, and 3) strip piecing. Traditional patchwork has identifying names based on the arrangement of colors and shapes.

===Blocks===
Patchwork blocks are pieced squares&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womenfolk.com/quilting_history/pieced.htm Quilting History]&lt;/ref&gt; made up of colored shapes that repeat specific shapes to create [[pattern]]s within the square or block of, say, light and dark or contrasting colors ([[motif (textile arts)|motif]]). The blocks can all repeat the same pattern, or blocks can have several different patterns. The patchwork blocks are typically around {{Convert|8–10|in2|cm2|abbr=on}}. They are sewn together in stacked rows to make a larger composition. Often strips of contrasting fabric forming a lattice separate the patchwork blocks from each other. Some common patchwork block names are Log Cabin, Drunkard's Path, Bear's Paw, Tulip, and Nine Patch.

A unique form of patchwork quilt is the crazy quilt. [[Crazy quilting]] was popular during the [[Victorian era]] (mid–late 19th century). The crazy quilt is made up of random shapes of luxurious fabric such as [[velvet]]s, [[silk]]s, and [[brocade]]s and buttons, lace, and other embellishments left over from the gowns they had made for themselves. The patchwork pieces are stitched together forming &quot;crazy&quot; or non-repeat, asymmetric compositions. Fancy [[embroidery]] embellishes the seam lines between the individual, pieced shapes. The crazy quilt was a status symbol, as only well-to-do women had a staff to do all the household work, and had the time to sew their crazy quilt. Traditionally, the top was left without lining or batting. Many surviving crazy quilts still have the newspaper and other foundation papers used for piecing.

===Overall===
Overall patchwork designs are incrementally pieced geometric shapes stitched together to form a larger random or composed design. The colored shapes can be randomly pieced or follow a strict order to create a specific effect, e.g. value (light to dark) progressions, or [[checkerboard]] effects. Names such as Hit or Miss, Clamshell, back-stitch, needle weave, criss-cross, and Starburst identify some overall patchwork structures.

Round pieces formed by cutting a circle of fabric, gathering the edges with a running stitch and pulling them tightly shut are known as Suffolk puffs in the United Kingdom due to the Suffolk wool used to pad them. In the United States, the pieces are called yo-yos. The origin date of this type of piecework is unknown, but it was popular in the United States during the [[Great Depression]] and in the United Kingdom after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.quilt.org.uk/quilt-140-2004_1_B+suffolk+puffs+table+coverlets.html |title= 2004-1-B suffolk puffs table coverlets |work=The Quilt Association|accessdate=2020-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Needlecraft Style Directory|last= Whittle| first = Sarah| location = North America| publisher = Barron’s Educational Series, Inc.| page = 79| date = 2013| isbn = 978-1-4380-0103-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These round pieces can be joined with several stitches on the sides to connect other puffs together and form a coverlet or other items. Scrap pieces may be used, or colors may be coordinated into patterns.

===Strip piecing===
Strip piecing involves stitching together pieces of fabric in repeat patterns into long strips and then stitching the strips together lengthwise. The patchwork strips can be alternated with strips of contrasting colors. A typical strip patchwork quilt is the [http://newquilters.com/four-patch-quilt-blocks-strip-piecing-tutorial/ Four Patch] pattern.

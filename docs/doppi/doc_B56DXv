==Optical isolators and thermodynamics==
It might seem at first glance that a device that allows light to flow in only one direction would violate [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation|Kirchhoff's law]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]], by allowing light energy to flow from a cold object to a hot object and blocking it in the other direction, but the violation is avoided because the isolator must absorb (not reflect) the light from the hot object and will eventually reradiate it to the cold one. Attempts to re-route the photons back to their source unavoidably involve creating a route by which other photons can travel from the hot body to the cold one, avoiding the paradox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/physics/mungan/_files/documents/Scholarship/FaradayIsolators.pdf |title=Faraday Isolators and Kirchhoff's Law: A Puzzle |accessdate=2006-07-18 |last=Mungan |first=C.E. |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/064577e0|title=On the Magnetic Rotation of Light and the Second Law of Thermo-Dynamics|journal=Nature|volume=64|issue=1667|pages=577–578|year=1901|last1=Rayleigh|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="3160" xml:space="preserve">In [[optics]], '''optical path length''' ('''OPL''') or '''optical distance''' is the product of the [[arc length|geometric length]] of the [[optical path|path]] followed by [[light]] through a given system, and the [[refractive index]] of the [[optical medium|medium]] through which it propagates. In many textbooks, it is symbolically written as ''Λ''. A difference in optical path length between two paths is often called the '''optical path difference''' ('''OPD'''). OPL and OPD are important because they determine the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the light and governs [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and [[diffraction]] of light as it propagates.

==Formulation==

===Optical path length===
In a medium of constant refractive index, ''n'', the OPL for a path of geometrical length ''s'' is just

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{OPL} = n s .\,&lt;/math&gt;

If the refractive index varies along the path, the OPL is given by a [[line integral]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{OPL} = \int_C n \mathrm d s,\quad&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the local refractive index as a function of distance along the path ''C''.

An [[electromagnetic wave]] propagating along a path ''C'' has the [[phase shift]] over ''C'' as if it was propagating a path in a [[vacuum]], length of which, is equal to the optical path length of ''C''.  Thus, if a [[wave]] is traveling through several different media, then the optical path length of each medium can be added to find the total optical path length.  The optical path difference between the paths taken by two identical waves can then be used to find the phase change.  Finally, using the phase change, the interference between the two waves can be calculated.

[[Fermat's principle]] states that the path light takes between two points is the path that has the minimum optical path length.

===Optical path difference===

The OPD corresponds to the [[phase shift]] undergone by the light emitted from two previously [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] sources when passed through mediums of different [[Refractive index|refractive indices]]. For example, a wave passed through glass will appear to travel a greater distance than an identical wave in air. This is because the source in the glass will have experienced a greater number of wavelengths due to the higher [[refractive index]] of the [[glass]].

The OPD can be calculated from the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{OPD}= d_1 n_1 - d_2 n_2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the distances of the ray passing through medium 1 or 2, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the greater refractive index (e.g., glass) and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the smaller refractive index (e.g., air).

      <text bytes="2399" xml:space="preserve">The '''optical power budget''' in a [[fiber-optic communication]] [[data link|link]] is the allocation of available optical [[Power (physics)|power]] (launched into a given fiber by a given source) among various loss-producing mechanisms such as launch [[coupling loss]], fiber [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]], splice losses, and [[fiber-optic connector|connector]] losses, in order to ensure that adequate [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] strength (optical power) is available at the receiver. In  optical power budget attenuation is specified  in [[decibel]] (dB) and optical power in [[dBm]].

The amount of optical power launched into a given fiber by a given transmitter depends on the nature of its active optical source ([[LED]] or [[laser diode]]) and the type of [[optical fiber|fiber]], including such parameters as [[core diameter]] and [[numerical aperture]]. Manufacturers sometimes specify an optical power budget only for a fiber that is optimum for their equipment—or specify only that their equipment will operate over a given distance, without mentioning the fiber characteristics. The user must first ascertain, from the manufacturer or by testing, the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] losses for the type of fiber to be used, and the required signal strength for a given level of performance.

In addition to [[transmission loss]], including those of any splices and connectors, allowance should be made for at least several dB of [[optical power margin]] losses, to compensate for [[electronic component|component]] aging and to allow for future splices in the event of a severed [[optical fiber cable|cable]].

:''L''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = ''αL'' + ''L''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + ''L''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;

Definitions:
*''L''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; - Total loss
*''α'' - Fiber attenuation
*''L'' - Length of fiber
*''L''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; - Connector loss
*''L''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; - Splice loss

[[Passive optical network]]s use optical splitters to divide the downstream signal into up to 32 streams, most often a power of two. Each division in two halves the transmitted power and therefore causes a minimum attenuation of 3&amp;nbsp;dB (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;−0.3&lt;/sup&gt;).

In an [[optical communications]] [[data link|link]], the '''optical power margin''' is the difference between the optical [[Power (physics)|power]] that is launched by a given transmitter into the fiber, less transmission losses from all causes, and the minimum optical power that is required by the receiver for a specified level of performance. An optical power margin is typically measured using a calibrated [[light source]] and an [[optical power meter]].

The optical power margin is usually expressed in [[decibel]]s (dB). At least several dB of optical power margin should be included in the [[optical power budget]]. The amount of optical power launched into a given fiber by a given transmitter depends on the nature of its active [[optical source]] ([[LED]] or [[laser diode]]) and the type of fiber, including such parameters as [[core diameter]] and [[numerical aperture]].

[[File:Light dispersion of a mercury-vapor lamp with a flint glass prism IPNr°0125.jpg|thumb|White [[light]] is [[dispersion (optics)|dispersed]] by a [[triangular prism (optics)|prism]] into the colors of the visible spectrum.]]

The '''visible spectrum''' is the portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] that is [[visual perception|visible]] to the [[human eye]]. [[Electromagnetic radiation]] in this range of [[wavelength]]s is called [[visible light]] or simply [[light]]. A typical [[human eye]] will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to 750 [[nanometers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Biology: Concepts and Applications | author = Starr, Cecie | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-534-46226-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/biologyconceptsa06edstar| url-access = registration | page = [https://archive.org/details/biologyconceptsa06edstar/page/94 94] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 400–790&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz#SI prefixed forms of hertz|THz]].

The spectrum does not contain all the [[color]]s that the human [[visual system]] can distinguish. [[Excitation purity|Unsaturated colors]] such as [[pink]], or [[purple]] variations like [[magenta]], for example, are absent because they can only be made from a mix of multiple wavelengths. Colors containing only one wavelength are also called [[Excitation purity|pure colors]] or spectral colors.

Visible wavelengths pass largely unattenuated through the [[Earth's atmosphere]] via the &quot;[[optical window]]&quot; region of the electromagnetic spectrum. An example of this phenomenon is when clean air [[scattering|scatters]] blue light more than red light, and so the midday sky appears blue (apart from the area around the sun which appears white because the light is not scattered as much). The optical window is also referred to as the &quot;visible window&quot; because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum. The [[near infrared]] (NIR) window lies just out of the human vision, as well as the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) window, and the long wavelength or far infrared (LWIR or FIR) window, although other animals may experience them.

==History==
[[File:Newton's color circle.png|thumb|Newton's color circle, from ''Opticks'' of 1704, showing the colors he associated with [[musical note]]s. The spectral colors from red to violet are divided by the notes of the musical scale, starting at D. The circle completes a full [[octave]], from D to D. Newton's circle places red, at one end of the spectrum, next to violet, at the other. This reflects the fact that non-spectral [[purple]] colors are observed when red and violet light are mixed.]]

In the 13th century, [[Roger Bacon]] theorized that [[rainbow]]s were produced by a similar process to the passage of light through glass or crystal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/thescienceoflogi01coffuoft|page=[https://archive.org/details/thescienceoflogi01coffuoft/page/185 185]|quote=roger bacon prism.|title=The Science of Logic: An Inquiry Into the Principles of Accurate Thought |first=Peter|last=Coffey|year=1912|publisher=Longmans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[Isaac Newton]] discovered that prisms could disassemble and reassemble white light, and described the phenomenon in his book ''[[Opticks]]''. He was the first to use the word ''spectrum'' ([[Latin]] for &quot;appearance&quot; or &quot;apparition&quot;) in this sense in print in 1671 in describing his [[experiment]]s in [[optics]]. Newton observed that, when a narrow beam of [[sunlight]] strikes the face of a glass [[Dispersive prism|prism]] at an angle, some is [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] and some of the beam passes into and through the glass, emerging as different-colored bands. Newton hypothesized light to be made up of &quot;corpuscles&quot; (particles) of different colors, with the different colors of light moving at different speeds in transparent matter, red light moving more quickly than violet in glass. The result is that red light is bent ([[refraction|refracted]]) less sharply than violet as it passes through the prism, creating a spectrum of colors.

[[File:Newton prismatic colours.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Newton's observation of prismatic colors ([[David Brewster]] 1855)]] Newton originally divided the spectrum into six named colors: [[red]], [[Orange (color)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], and [[Violet (color)|violet]]. He later added [[indigo]] as the seventh color since he believed that seven was a perfect number as derived from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Sophism|sophists]], of there being a connection between the colors, the musical notes, the known objects in the [[solar system]], and the days of the week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Isacoff2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Isacoff|first=Stuart|title=Temperament: How Music Became a Battleground for the Great Minds of Western Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kasFeTRcf4C&amp;pg=PA12|access-date=18 March 2014|date=16 January 2009|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-56051-3|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human eye is relatively insensitive to indigo's frequencies, and some people who have otherwise-good vision cannot distinguish indigo from blue and violet. For this reason, some later commentators, including [[Isaac Asimov]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=Eyes on the universe : a history of the telescope|year=1975|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-395-20716-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/eyesonuniverse00isaa/page/59 59]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/eyesonuniverse00isaa/page/59}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that indigo should not be regarded as a color in its own right but merely as a shade of blue or violet. Evidence indicates that what Newton meant by &quot;indigo&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; does not correspond to the modern meanings of those color words. Comparing Newton's observation of prismatic colors to a color image of the visible light spectrum shows that &quot;indigo&quot; corresponds to what is today called blue, whereas his &quot;blue&quot; corresponds to [[cyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Ralph M.|title=The perception of color|year=1974|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-24785-2|edition=null}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLaren|first=K.|title=Newton's indigo|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|date=March 2007|volume=10|issue=4|pages=225–229|doi=10.1002/col.5080100411}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldman|first=Gary|title=Introduction to light : the physics of light, vision, and color|year=2002|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-42118-6|pages=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbsoAXWbnr4C&amp;q=Newton+color+Indigo&amp;pg=PA193|edition=Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] wrote about optical spectra in his ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colours]]''. Goethe used the word ''spectrum'' (''Spektrum'') to designate a ghostly optical [[afterimage]], as did [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]''. Goethe argued that the continuous spectrum was a compound phenomenon. Where Newton narrowed the beam of light to isolate the phenomenon, Goethe observed that a wider aperture produces not a spectrum but rather reddish-yellow and blue-cyan edges with [[white]] between them. The spectrum appears only when these edges are close enough to overlap.

In the early 19th century, the concept of the visible spectrum became more definite, as light outside the visible range was discovered and characterized by [[William Herschel]] ([[infrared]]) and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]] ([[ultraviolet]]), [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The connection between the visible spectrum and [[color vision]] was explored by Thomas Young and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in the early 19th century. Their [[Young–Helmholtz theory|theory of color vision]] correctly proposed that the eye uses three distinct receptors to perceive color.

==Color perception across species==
{{See also|Color vision#Physiology of color perception}}
Many species can see light within frequencies outside the human &quot;visible spectrum&quot;. [[Bee]]s and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them find [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] in flowers. Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to their appearance in ultraviolet light rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Birds, too, can see into the ultraviolet (300–400&amp;nbsp;nm), and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuthill|first=Innes C |author-link=Innes Cuthill |editor=Peter J.B.

Colors that can be produced by visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (monochromatic light) are called [[Spectral color|pure spectral colors]]. The various color ranges indicated in the illustration are an approximation: The spectrum is continuous, with no clear boundaries between one color and the next.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno, Thomas J. and Svoronos, Paris D.

[[File:Rendered Spectrum.png|thumb|left|upright=1.75|A rendering of the visible spectrum on a gray background produces non-spectral mixtures of pure spectrum with gray, which fit into the [[sRGB]] color space.]]
Color displays (e.g. [[computer monitor]]s and [[television]]s) cannot reproduce [[color vision|''all'' colors discernible by a human eye]]. Colors outside the color [[gamut]] of the device, such as most [[spectral color]]s, can only be [[approximation|approximated]]. For color-accurate reproduction, a spectrum can be projected onto a uniform [[gray (color)|gray]] field. The resulting [[additive color|mixed colors]] can have all their [[RGB color model|R, G, B coordinates]] non-negative, and so can be reproduced without distortion. This accurately simulates looking at a spectrum on a gray background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/repspec/|title=Reproducing Visible Spectra|website=RepairFAQ.org|access-date=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectroscopy==

[[Spectroscopy]] is the study of objects based on the spectrum of color they emit, absorb or reflect. Spectroscopy is an important investigative tool in [[astronomy]], where scientists use it to analyze the properties of distant objects. Typically, [[astronomical spectroscopy]] uses high-dispersion [[diffraction grating]]s to observe spectra at very high spectral resolutions. [[Helium]] was first detected by analysis of the spectrum of the [[sun]]. [[Chemical element]]s can be detected in astronomical objects by [[emission line]]s and [[absorption line]]s.

The shifting of spectral lines can be used to measure the [[Doppler shift]] ([[red shift]] or [[blue shift]]) of distant objects.

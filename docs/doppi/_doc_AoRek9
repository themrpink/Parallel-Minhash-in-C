or

:&lt;math&gt;V^2 = 0.10875 \times \frac{4 G}{3 D_3},&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;V^2 = 0.10875 \times \mathrm{TOI}.&lt;/math&gt;

In a power sense (''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a power quantity), a factor of 0.10875 corresponds to −9.636&amp;nbsp;dB, so by this approximate analysis, the 1&amp;nbsp;dB compression point occurs roughly 9.6&amp;nbsp;dB below the TOI.

Recall: [[decibel]] figure = 10&amp;nbsp;dB × log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(power ratio) = 20&amp;nbsp;dB × log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(voltage ratio).

==Notes==
* The third-order intercept point is an extrapolated convergence – not directly measurable – of [[intermodulation distortion]] products in the desired output.
* It indicates how well a device (for example an amplifier) or a system (for example, a receiver) performs in the presence of strong signals.
* It is sometimes used (interchangeably with the 1&amp;nbsp;dB compression point) to define the upper limit of the [[dynamic range]] of an amplifier.
* Determination of a third-order intercept point of a [[superheterodyne receiver]] is accomplished by using two test frequencies that fall within the first [[intermediate frequency]] [[Frequency mixer|mixer]] [[passband]]. Usually, the test frequencies are about 20–30&amp;nbsp;kHz apart.
* The concept of intercept point has no meaning for strongly nonlinear systems, such as when an output signal is clipped due to limited supply voltage.

      <text bytes="3634" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]], a '''time-assignment speech interpolation''' ('''TASI''') was an analog technique used on certain long [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] links to increase voice-transmission capacity.

TASI takes advantage of the fact that in typical person-person conversation, speech in a single direction occurs for approximately 40% of the time, the remaining time being occupied with pauses and/or silence. Statistical analysis demonstrated that for an average voice channel usage of 40%, over 74 speech conversations could be handled using 37 full [[Duplex (telecommunications)|Duplex]] speech circuits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ascend.com/bstj/vol41-1962/articles/bstj41-4-1439.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141014155952/http://www.ascend.com/bstj/vol41-1962/articles/bstj41-4-1439.pdf|url-status = dead|archive-date = October 14, 2014|title = Overall Characteristics of a TASI system|date = September 19, 1961|accessdate = 8 October 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby doubling potential revenue for a small capital outlay relative to a highly expensive cable. e.g. £12.5 million (£263 million as of 2014) cost of the [[TAT-1]] cable on which TASI was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.secretscotland.org.uk/index.php/Secrets/TAT-1|title = TAT-1|date = |accessdate = 8 October 2014|website = Secret Scotland|publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141015112604/http://www.secretscotland.org.uk/index.php/Secrets/TAT-1|archive-date = 15 October 2014|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TASI worked by switching additional users onto any [[voice channel]] temporarily idled because an original [[User (telecommunications)|user]] has stopped speaking. When the original user resumes speaking, that user would, in turn, be switched to any channel that happened to be idle. The speech detector function is called [[voice activity detection]]. Clipping or loss of speech would occur for all conversations that needed to be assigned to an available idle channel and in practice lasted at least 17&amp;nbsp;ms whilst information required to re-connect both parties was signalled by the TASI control circuits. An additional freezeout period lasting between 0 and 500&amp;nbsp;ms would depend on the instantaneous loading of voice circuits. In actual use, these delays presented few problems in typical conversations.

One of the issues with using this type of technology was that the users listening on an idled channel can sometimes hear the conversation that has been switched onto it. Generally the sound heard was of very low volume and individual words are not distinguishable. See also [[crosstalk]] for a similar phenomenon in telecommunications. Another potential issue was ensuring that non-voice type circuits (e.g. Music or radio type circuits where pauses would occur infrequently) were not routed via TASI speech channels since these could seriously degrade the level of service where callers would encounter frequent clipped speech and breaks in the conversation.

TASI was invented by [[Bell Labs]] in the early 1960s to increase the capacity of [[transatlantic telephone cable]]s.  It was one of their first applications requiring [[Electronic switching system|electronic switching]] of voice circuits.

Later [[digital circuit multiplication equipment]] included TASI as a feature, not as distinct hardware.

      <text bytes="966" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]], '''time code ambiguity''' is the shortest interval between successive repetitions of the same [[time code]] value.

For example, in a [[time code]] in which year-of-century (the '72' in 10/04/72) is the most slowly changing [[field (computer science)|field]], the time code ambiguity would be 100 years; it is ambiguous whether this value refers to a date in 1872, 1972 or some other century. For a [[Digital data|digital]] [[clock]] in which hours and minutes up to a maximum of 11:59 are displayed, the time code ambiguity would be 12 hours.

The [[Year 2000 problem]] is an example of the pitfalls of time code ambiguity. Very often dates are now recorded with 4 digit years (10/04/1972). Assuming that the use of a 4-digit year field would continue, even in the far future, this would change the time code ambiguity from 100 years to 10&amp;nbsp;000 years.

{{Short description|data structure, subgraph of a weighted graph}}
[[File:Minimum spanning tree.svg|thumb|300px|right|A [[planar graph]] and its minimum spanning tree. Each edge is labeled with its weight, which here is roughly proportional to its length.]]
A '''minimum spanning tree''' ('''MST''') or '''minimum weight spanning tree''' is a subset of the edges of a [[connected graph|connected]], edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] together, without any [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]s and with the minimum possible total edge weight. That is, it is a [[spanning tree]] whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible. More generally, any edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a '''minimum spanning forest''', which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]].

There are quite a few use cases for minimum spanning trees. One example would be a telecommunications company trying to lay cable in a new neighborhood. If it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths (e.g. roads), then there would be a graph containing the points (e.g. houses) connected by those paths. Some of the paths might be more expensive, because they are longer, or require the cable to be buried deeper; these paths would be represented by edges with larger weights. Currency is an acceptable unit for edge weight &amp;ndash; there is no requirement for edge lengths to obey normal rules of geometry such as the [[triangle inequality]]. A ''spanning tree'' for that graph would be a subset of those paths that has no cycles but still connects every house; there might be several spanning trees possible. A ''minimum spanning tree'' would be one with the lowest total cost, representing the least expensive path for laying the cable.

==Properties==

===Possible multiplicity===
If there are {{mvar|n}} vertices in the graph, then each spanning tree has {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} edges.

[[File:Multiple minimum spanning trees.svg|thumb|This figure shows there may be more than one minimum spanning tree in a graph. In the figure, the two trees below the graph are two possibilities of minimum spanning tree of the given graph.]]
There may be several minimum spanning trees of the same weight; in particular, if all the edge weights of a given graph are the same, then every spanning tree of that graph is minimum.

===Uniqueness===
''If each edge has a distinct weight then there will be only one, unique minimum spanning tree''. This is true in many realistic situations, such as the telecommunications company example above, where it's unlikely any two paths have ''exactly'' the same cost. This generalizes to spanning forests as well.

Proof:
# [[Proof by contradiction|Assume the contrary]], that there are two different MSTs ''A'' and ''B''.
# Since ''A'' and ''B'' differ despite containing the same nodes, there is at least one edge that belongs to one but not the other.  Among such edges, let ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; be the one with least weight; this choice is unique because the edge weights are all distinct.  Without loss of generality, assume ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is in ''A''.
# As ''B'' is an MST, {''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;} &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''B'' must contain a cycle ''C'' with ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
# As a tree, ''A'' contains no cycles, therefore ''C'' must have an edge ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is not in ''A''.
# Since ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; was chosen as the unique lowest-weight edge among those belonging to exactly one of ''A'' and ''B'', the weight of ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be greater than the weight of ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
# As ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are part of the cycle C, replacing ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in ''B'' therefore yields a spanning tree with a smaller weight.
# This contradicts the assumption that ''B'' is an MST.

More generally, if the edge weights are not all distinct then only the (multi-)set of weights in minimum spanning trees is certain to be unique; it is the same for all minimum spanning trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/2204 |title=Do the minimum spanning trees of a weighted graph have the same number of edges with a given weight?|website=cs.stackexchange.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimum-cost subgraph===
If the weights are ''positive'', then a minimum spanning tree is in fact a minimum-cost [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] connecting all vertices, since subgraphs containing [[Path (graph theory)|cycles]] necessarily have more total weight. {{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

===Cycle property===
''For any cycle {{math|C}} in the graph, if the weight of an edge {{math|e}} of {{math|C}} is larger than the individual weights of all other edges of {{math|C}}, then this edge cannot belong to an MST.''

Proof: [[Proof by contradiction|Assume the contrary]], i.e. that {{math|e}} belongs to an MST {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Then deleting {{math|e}} will break {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} into two subtrees with the two ends of {{math|e}} in different subtrees. The remainder of {{math|C}} reconnects the subtrees, hence there is an edge {{math|f}} of {{math|C}} with ends in different subtrees, i.e., it reconnects the subtrees into a tree {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} with weight less than that of {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, because the weight of {{math|f}} is less than the weight of {{math|e}}.

===Cut property===
[[File:Msp-the-cut-correct.svg|thumb|400px|This figure shows the cut property of MSTs. T is the only MST of the given graph. If S = {A,B,D,E}, thus V-S = {C,F}, then there are 3 possibilities of the edge across the cut(S,V-S), they are edges BC, EC, EF of the original graph. Then, e is one of the minimum-weight-edge for the cut, therefore S ∪ {e} is part of the MST T.]]
''For any [[cut (graph theory)|cut]] ''C'' of the graph, if the weight of an edge ''e'' in the cut-set of ''C'' is strictly smaller than the weights of all other edges of the cut-set of ''C'', then this edge belongs to all MSTs of the graph.''

Proof: [[Reductio ad absurdum|Assume]] that there is an MST ''T'' that does not contain ''e''. Adding ''e'' to ''T'' will produce a cycle, that crosses the cut once at ''e'' and crosses back at another edge ''e' ''. Deleting ''e' '' we get a spanning tree ''T∖{e'}∪{e}'' of strictly smaller weight than ''T''. This contradicts the assumption that ''T'' was a MST.

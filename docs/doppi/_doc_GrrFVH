'''Mikael Agricola''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈmikɑel ˈɑɡrikolɑ|lang|Fi-Mikael_Agricola.ogg}}; c. 1510 – 9 April 1557) was a [[Finns|Finnish]] [[Lutheran]] clergyman who became the de facto founder of literary [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and a prominent proponent of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in [[Sweden]], including [[Finland under Swedish rule|Finland]], which was a Swedish territory at the time. He is often called the &quot;father of literary Finnish&quot;. 

Agricola was consecrated as the [[bishop of Turku]] (Åbo) in 1554, without papal approval. He continued the [[Reformation in Sweden|reform]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland#Part of the Church of Sweden|Finnish church (then a part of the Church of Sweden)]] along [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] lines. He translated the New Testament into Finnish and also produced the prayer book and hymns used in Finland's new Lutheran Church. This work set the rules of orthography that are the basis of modern Finnish spelling. His thorough work is particularly remarkable in that he accomplished it in only three years. 

He died of sudden illness while returning from a trip during which he assisted in negotiating the [[Treaty of Novgorod (1557)|Treaty of Novgorod]] with the [[Tsardom of Russia]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Michael Olaui or Mikkel Olofsson (Finnish ''Mikael Olavinpoika'') was born in c. 1510 in the village of Torsby in [[Pernå]] (''Pernaja''), [[Uusimaa|Nyland]] (''Uusimaa''), in what now is part of [[Finland]]) but then was part of the [[Kalmar Union]]. He was named after the patron saint of Pernå's church. The exact date of his birth, like most details of his life, is unknown. His family was a quite wealthy peasant family according to the local [[bailiff]]'s accounting. He had three sisters, but their names are not known. His teachers apparently recognized his aptitude for languages and his rector Bartholomeus sent him to [[Vyborg|Viborg]] (Fi. ''Viipuri''; now Vyborg, [[Russia]]) for [[Latin school]] and some [[priest]]ly training, where he attended the school of Erasmus. It is not known whether his first language was Finnish or Swedish; Pernå was mostly a Swedish-speaking district, but the language he used in his works indicates that he was a native speaker of Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ruotsin itämaa|last=Tarkiainen|first=Kari|publisher=Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland|year=2010|isbn=978-951-583-212-2|location=Helsinki|pages=236-243}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he mastered both languages like a native speaker and was possibly a bilingual child.&lt;ref name=&quot;KB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=14 |title=Agricola, Mikael (1510–1557)  |last1= Heininen |first1= Simo |date=2014 |website= The National Biography of Finland |accessdate=2016-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies===
When Michael studied in [[Vyborg|Viborg]] (Viipuri) he assumed the surname Agricola (&quot;farmer&quot; gv. &quot;agriculture&quot;); surnames based on one's father's status and occupation were common for first-generation scholars at the time. It was probably in Viipuri where he first came in touch with the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Humanism]]. The Viipuri castle was ruled by a German count, [[John_VII_of_Hoya|Johann]], who had served the king of Sweden, [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]]. The count was a supporter of the Reformation, and they already held [[Lutheran]] services.&lt;ref name=&quot;KB&quot;/&gt;

In 1528 Agricola followed his teacher to [[Turku]] (Åbo), then the center of the Finnish side of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] realm and the capital of the [[Diocese|bishopric]]. There Agricola became a scribe in bishop [[Martinus Skytte]]'s office.&lt;ref name=&quot;KB&quot;/&gt; While in Turku Agricola met [[Martin Luther]]'s first Finnish student [[Petrus Särkilahti]], who eagerly spread the idea of the Reformation. Särkilahti died in 1529, and it was up to Agricola to continue Särkilahti's work. Agricola was ordained for priesthood circa 1531.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 1536 the bishop of Turku sent Agricola to study in [[Wittenberg]] in Germany. He concentrated on the lectures of [[Philipp Melanchthon]], who was an expert in [[Greek (language)|Greek]], the original language of the [[New Testament]]. In Wittenberg Agricola studied under Luther.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=93ErAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;vq Lutheran Cyclopedia] entry on Agricola, Michael.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricola got recommendations to Swedish King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] from both of the reformists. He sent two letters to Gustav, asking for a confirmation for a [[stipend]]. When the confirmation came, Agricola bought books (for example, the complete works of [[Aristotle]]). In 1537 he started translating the New Testament into Finnish.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Rector and ordinarius===
In 1539 Agricola returned to Turku and ended up as the rector of Turku (Cathedral) School. He did not like his job, calling his students &quot;untamed animals&quot;. At the time Gustav Vasa had confiscated the property of the church when he was consolidating his power but he also drove the Reformation. In 1544 Agricola received an order from the crown to send several talented young men to [[Stockholm]]'s taxing offices. For some reason, Agricola did not obey until the order was sent again the next year, with a more menacing tone. This episode probably affected their relations negatively.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 1546 Agricola lost his home and school in the Fire of Turku. On 22 February 1548, Gustav Vasa ordered Agricola to retire from his position as a rector. At this time Agricola was already married, but history knows his wife only by her name: Pirjo Olavintytär (Bridget, &quot;daughter of Olavi&quot;; Birgitta Olafsdotter, Brigida Olaui). His only son, [[Christian Agricola]] (Christianus Michaelis Agricola), was born 11 December 1550, and became the bishop of [[Tallinn]] in 1584.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

When an old bishop died in 1554, Gustav Vasa had Agricola consecrated as the ''[[Ordinary (officer)|ordinarius]]'' of Turku parish – for all practical purposes [[Bishop]] of Turku and by extension the first Lutheran bishop for all Finland. Agricola was not a particularly strict or dedicated reformer, although he did remove the [[Canon of the Mass]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Death===

In 1557, Agricola headed a delegation going to [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] on a diplomatic mission, and was in [[Moscow]] from 21 February to 24 March negotiating a [[peace treaty]], the [[Treaty of Novgorod (1557)]]. On 9 April he fell ill and died in [[Uusikirkko]] (now Polyane) village, part of the [[Kyrönniemi]] parish on the [[Karelian Isthmus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heininen|first=Simo|author2=Heikkilä, Markku|title=Kirchengeschichte Finnlands|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|year=2002|isbn=3-525-55444-3|language=German|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This day is also [[Elias Lönnrot]]'s birthday and it is celebrated in Finland as the day of the Finnish language. Agricola was buried inside Viipuri's church, but the exact location of the grave is not known.

==Literary achievements==

===''Abckiria''===
{{Main|Abckiria}}
Agricola had thought about translating the [[New Testament]] in his early years of study. At the time, however, there was no standard written form of [[Finnish language|Finnish]], so he started developing it. His first book, ''[[Abckiria]]'', which is nowadays known as the &quot;ABC-kirja&quot; or ABC-book, was a [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] for reading and a [[catechism]]. It was first printed in 1543.&lt;ref name=&quot;KIRJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agricola.fi/mikael-agricola/kirjallinen-tyo/ |title=Kirjallinen työ |date=2007 |language=fi |website=Finnish Bible Society |accessdate=2016-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512175013/http://www.agricola.fi/mikael-agricola/kirjallinen-tyo/ |archive-date=12 May 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The catechism was included because only very few people could afford the whole [[Bible]] at the time. The first printing contained 16 pages. 

A second printing was released in 1551 with 24 pages.

In 1966 Åke Åbergin, a librarian, discovered parts, while repairing book bindings, from an as yet unknown (likely the third) edition of the &quot;ABC-kirja&quot; that included the name of the printer, Amund Lauritsanpoika, and fortuitously the publishing date of 1559 (two years after the author's death) of the final as yet undiscovered 8 pages. The pages were likely the result of an imposing error and relegated to padding paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penttilä|first1=presented by Aarni|title=Näköispainos Mikael Agricolan ABCkirian eri painosten sälyneistä katkelmista|date=1998|publisher=Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura|location=[Helsinki]|isbn=951-717-303-2|pages=32|edition=reproduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Rucouskiria''===
Agricola's ''Rucouskiria'' (Modern Finnish spelling: Rukouskirja; literally, &quot;Prayer Book&quot;) was printed in March 1544. At the beginning of the book, Agricola wrote about many topics concerning all-round [[education]] and the Reformation's effects in Finland.&lt;ref name=&quot;KIRJ&quot;/&gt; The book includes four prefaces and about 700 prayers on many topics; it even has twelve structurally different kinds of prayers, instead of the usual two or three. It is the most independent work by Agricola and contains approximately 900 pages. His sources include the works of [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], and [[Erasmus]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

[[Image:Se Wsi Testamenti.png|150px|thumb|Cover of [[Se Wsi Testamenti]], or the New Testament]]

===New Testament translation===
{{Main|Se Wsi Testamenti}}

Agricola's most prominent book is the first [[Se Wsi Testamenti|Finnish-language translation]] of the [[New Testament]]. The manuscript was completed in 1548. It contains 718 pages and many illustrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;KIRJ&quot;/&gt;

===Liturgical books===
While Agricola was in Wittenberg, he translated three smaller [[liturgical book]]s into Finnish. These books were printed in 1549.&lt;ref name=&quot;KIRJ&quot;/&gt;

''Käsikirja Castesta ia muista Christikunnan Menoista'' includes forms for christening, marriage and burial, as well as speeches for the sick, mourning and dying. It is translated from Olaus Petri's corresponding work except for the christening and marriage portions, which are from Luther. It also contains minor elements translated from [[Caspar Huberinus]]' works.

''Messu eli Herran echtolinen'' includes the form for a service. It is also based on Olaus Petri's work and a few Finnish manuscripts. In this book Agricola revealed his next mission: the translation of the [[Old Testament]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

''Se meiden Herran Jesusen Christusen Pina, ylesnousemus ia tauiaisen Astumus, niste Neliest Euangelisterist coghottuon'' tells about [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]'s suffering. It is collected from all four [[gospel]]s. This book was influenced heavily by [[Johannes Bugenhagen]], a teacher in Wittenberg. It was mainly translated from the German version, but some parts are influenced by the Swedish version and Agricola's own translation of the New Testament.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Commemorations==

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] remembers Bishop Agricola annually on 10 April.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

[[Mikael Agricola Church]] in Helsinki is named after Agricola.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.helsinginkirkot.fi/en/churches/mikael-agricolan-church |title=Mikael Agricola Church |access-date=30 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311003522/http://www.helsinginkirkot.fi/en/churches/mikael-agricolan-church |archive-date=11 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, 450 years after his death, Agricola was selected as the main motif for a commemorative coin, the €10 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)#2007 coinage|Mikael Agricola and Finnish language commemorative coin]]. This collector coin was issued to honor Agricola's life work as a contributor to the Protestant reformation in Finland and as the father of the Finnish written language. The reverse side depicts a quill to reference the writer, while the coin's obverse side contains an artistic interpretation of a human figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolikot.com/uutiset/8/ :: Mikael Agricolan juhlaraha] Kolikot.com&lt;/ref&gt;

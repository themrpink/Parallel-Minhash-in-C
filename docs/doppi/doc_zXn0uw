In most circumstances, atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the [[fluid pressure|hydrostatic pressure]] caused by the [[weight]] of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] above the measurement point. As [[elevation]] increases, there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation. Pressure measures force per unit area, with [[International System of Units|SI units]] of [[Pascal (unit)|Pascals]] (1 pascal = 1 [[newton (unit)|newton]] per square [[metre]], 1{{nbsp}}N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). On average, a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 square [[centimetre]] (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), measured from mean (average) [[sea level]] to the top of Earth's atmosphere, has a [[mass]] of about 1.03 [[kilogram]] and exerts a [[force]] or &quot;weight&quot; of about 10.1 [[newtons]], resulting in a pressure of 10.1 N/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 101{{nbsp}}[[newton (unit)#Commonly seen as kilonewtons|kN]]/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (101 kilopascals, kPa). A column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1{{nbsp}}in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; would have a weight of about 14.7{{nbsp}}lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in a pressure of 14.7{{nbsp}}lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Mechanism==
&lt;!--what causes atmospheric pressure--&gt;
Atmospheric pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface, and is a function of the mass of the planet, the radius of the surface, and the amount and composition of the gases and their vertical distribution in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=atmospheric pressure (encyclopedic entry)|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/atmospheric-pressure/|magazine=National Geographic|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q &amp; A: Pressure - Gravity Matters?|url=https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=2232|website=Department of Physics|publisher=University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity, density variations due to temperature and variations in composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14whM9fEOzsC&amp;q=atmospheric+pressure+density+temperature+and+composition|title=Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry|last=Jacob|first=Daniel J.|date=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691001852|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mean sea-level pressure ==
[[File:Day5pressureforecast.png|thumb|left|Map showing atmospheric pressure in mbar or hPa]]
[[File:Mslp-jja-djf.png|thumb|15-year average mean sea-level pressure for June, July, and August (top) and December, January, and February (bottom). [[ECMWF re-analysis|ERA-15]] re-analysis.]]
[[File:Aircraft altimeter.JPG|thumb|Kollsman-type barometric aircraft [[altimeter]] (as used in North America) displaying an [[altitude]] of {{convert|80|ft|abbr=on}}, calibrated for 29.87 inHg sea-level pressure.]]

The ''mean sea-level pressure'' (MSLP) is the atmospheric pressure at [[mean sea level]] (PMSL). This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the [[Internet]]. When [[barometer]]s in the home are set to match the local weather reports, they measure pressure adjusted to sea level, not the actual local atmospheric pressure.

The ''[[altimeter setting]]'' in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment.

Average ''sea-level pressure'' is {{convert|1013.25|mbar|kPa inHg mmHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}. In aviation, weather reports ([[METAR]]), [[QNH]] is transmitted around the world in millibars or hectopascals (1 hectopascal = 1 millibar), except in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Colombia]] where it is reported in [[inches of mercury]] (to two decimal places). The United States and Canada also report ''sea-level pressure'' SLP, which is adjusted to sea level by a different method, in the remarks section, not in the internationally transmitted part of the code, in hectopascals or millibars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightplanning.navcanada.ca/cgi-bin/Fore-obs/metar.cgi?NoSession=NS_Inconnu&amp;format=dcd&amp;Langue=anglais&amp;Region=can&amp;Stations=CYVR&amp;Location= Sample METAR of CYVR] Nav Canada&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Canada's public weather reports, sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/montreal/weather/s0000635.html |title=Montreal Current Weather |publisher=CBC Montreal, Canada |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US weather code remarks, three digits are all that are transmitted; decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted: {{convert|1013.2|mbar|kPa|abbr=on|comma=off}}  is transmitted as 132; {{convert|1000.0|mbar|kPa|abbr=on|comma=off}} is transmitted as 000; 998.7{{nbsp}}mbar is transmitted as 987; etc. The highest ''sea-level pressure'' on [[Earth]] occurs in [[Siberia]], where the [[Siberian High]] often attains a ''sea-level pressure'' above {{convert|1050|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}, with record highs close to {{convert|1085|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}. The lowest measurable ''sea-level pressure'' is found at the centers of [[tropical cyclone]]s and [[tornado]]es, with a [[Atmospheric pressure#Records|record low]] of {{convert|870|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}.

== Surface pressure {{anchor|Surface}} ==
{{redirect|Surface pressure|surface pressure in physical chemistry|Pressure#Surface pressure and surface tension}}

''Surface pressure'' is the atmospheric pressure at a location on [[Earth]]'s surface ([[terrain]] and [[oceans]]).  It is directly proportional to the [[mass]] of air over that location.

For numerical reasons, atmospheric models such as [[general circulation model]]s (GCMs) usually predict the nondimensional ''[[logarithm]] of surface pressure''.

The average value of surface pressure on Earth is 985 hPa.&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobs&quot;&gt;Jacob, Daniel J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7B8EEn_sj0cC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22surface%20pressure%22&amp;f=false Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry]. Princeton University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to mean sea-level pressure, which involves the extrapolation of pressure to sea-level for locations above or below sea-level. The average pressure at mean sea-level ([[Sea Level|MSL]]) in the International Standard Atmosphere ([[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]]) is 1013.25 hPa, or 1 atmosphere (atm), or 29.92 inches of mercury.

Pressure (p), mass (m), and the acceleration due to gravity (g), are related by P = F/A = (m*g)/A, where A is surface area. Atmospheric pressure is thus proportional to the weight per unit area of the atmospheric mass above that location.

== Altitude variation ==

[[File:Atmospheric Pressure vs. Altitude.png|thumb|300px|Variation in atmospheric pressure with altitude, computed for 15&amp;nbsp;°C and 0% relative humidity.]]
[[File:Plastic bottle at 14000 feet, 9000 feet and 1000 feet, sealed at 14000 feet.png|thumb|This plastic bottle was sealed at approximately {{convert|14000|ft|m}} altitude, and was crushed by the increase in atmospheric pressure, recorded at {{convert|9000|ft|m}} and {{convert|1000|ft|m}}, as it was brought down towards sea level.]]

Pressure on Earth varies with the altitude of the surface; so air pressure on mountains is usually lower than air pressure at sea level. Pressure varies smoothly from the Earth's surface to the top of the [[mesosphere]]. Although the pressure changes with the weather, NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. One can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.psas.pdx.edu/RocketScience/PressureAltitude_Derived.pdf A quick derivation relating altitude to air pressure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928003908/http://psas.pdx.edu/RocketScience/PressureAltitude_Derived.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} by Portland State Aerospace Society, 2004, accessed 05032011&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure, and it is necessary to know these to compute an accurate figure. The graph {{if mobile|above|at right}} was developed for a temperature of 15&amp;nbsp;°C and a relative humidity of 0%.

At low altitudes above sea level, the pressure decreases by about {{convert|1.2|kPa|hPa|abbr=on}} for every 100&amp;nbsp;metres. For higher altitudes within the [[troposphere]], the following equation (the [[barometric formula]]) relates atmospheric pressure ''p'' to altitude ''h'':
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p &amp;=       p_0 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{L \cdot h}{T_0} \right)^\frac{g \cdot M}{R_0 \cdot L} \\
    &amp;= p_0 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{g \cdot h}{c_\text{p} \cdot T_0} \right)^{\frac{c_\text{p} \cdot M}{R_0}}
       \approx p_0 \cdot \exp \left(-\frac{g \cdot h \cdot M}{T_0 \cdot R_0} \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Local variation ==

Atmospheric pressure varies widely on Earth, and these changes are important in studying [[weather]] and [[climate]]. See [[pressure system]] for the effects of air pressure variations on weather.

Atmospheric pressure shows a diurnal or semidiurnal (twice-daily) cycle caused by global [[atmospheric tides]]. This effect is strongest in tropical zones, with an amplitude of a few millibars, and almost zero in polar areas. These variations have two superimposed cycles, a circadian (24&amp;nbsp;h) cycle and semi-circadian (12&amp;nbsp;h) cycle.

== Records ==
The highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded on Earth (above 750 meters) was {{convert|1084.8|hPa|inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}} measured in [[Tosontsengel, Zavkhan|Tosontsengel, Mongolia]] on 19 December 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;wmo.asu.edu&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://wmo.asu.edu/highest-sea-lvl-air-pressure-above-700m |title=World: Highest Sea Level Air Pressure Above 750&amp;nbsp;m |publisher=Wmo.asu.edu |date=2001-12-19 |accessdate=2013-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017130834/http://wmo.asu.edu/highest-sea-lvl-air-pressure-above-700m |archivedate=2012-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded (below 750 meters) was at Agata in [[Evenk Autonomous Okrug]], Russia (66°53'{{nbsp}}N, 93°28'{{nbsp}}E, elevation: {{convert|261|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) on 31 December 1968 of {{convert|1083.8|hPa|inHg|3|abbr=on|comma=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://wmo.asu.edu/world-highest-sea-level-air-pressure-below-700m |title=World: Highest Sea Level Air Pressure Below 750&amp;nbsp;m |publisher=Wmo.asu.edu |date=1968-12-31 |accessdate=2013-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514175318/http://wmo.asu.edu/world-highest-sea-level-air-pressure-below-700m |archivedate=2013-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The discrimination is due to the problematic assumptions (assuming a standard lapse rate) associated with reduction of sea level from high elevations.&lt;ref name=&quot;wmo.asu.edu&quot; /&gt;

The [[Dead Sea]], the lowest place on Earth at {{convert|430|m}} below sea level, has a correspondingly high typical atmospheric pressure of 1065{{nbsp}}hPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramer |first=MR |author2=Springer C |author3=Berkman N |author4=Glazer M |author5=Bublil M |author6=Bar-Yishay E |author7=Godfrey S |title=Rehabilitation of hypoxemic patients with COPD at low altitude at the Dead Sea, the lowest place on earth |journal=Chest |date=March 1998 |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=571–575 |url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/data/Journals/CHEST/21761/571.pdf |doi=10.1378/chest.113.3.571 |pmid=9515826 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195349/http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/data/Journals/CHEST/21761/571.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A below-sea-level surface pressure record of {{convert|1081.8|hPa|inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}} was set on 21 February 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Court |first=Arnold |year=1969 |title=Improbable Pressure Extreme: 1070 Mb. |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=248–50 |jstor=26252600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest non-tornadic atmospheric pressure ever measured was 870&amp;nbsp;hPa (0.858&amp;nbsp;atm; 25.69&amp;nbsp;inHg), set on 12 October 1979, during [[Typhoon Tip]] in the western Pacific Ocean. The measurement was based on an instrumental observation made from a reconnaissance aircraft.&lt;ref name=FAQ1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E1.html |title=Subject: E1), Which is the most intense tropical cyclone on record? |author=Chris Landsea|publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]]|date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2010-11-23|authorlink=Chris Landsea| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101206200600/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E1.html| archivedate= 6 December 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement based on depth of water ==
One [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] (101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa or 14.7&amp;nbsp;psi) is also the pressure caused by the weight of a column of fresh water of approximately 10.3&amp;nbsp;m (33.8&amp;nbsp;ft). Thus, a diver 10.3&amp;nbsp;m underwater experiences a pressure of about 2 atmospheres (1&amp;nbsp;atm of air plus 1&amp;nbsp;atm of water). Conversely, 10.3&amp;nbsp;m is the maximum height to which water can be raised using [[suction]] under standard atmospheric conditions.

Low pressures such as [[natural gas]] lines are sometimes specified in [[inch of water|inches of water]], typically written as ''w.c.'' (water column) gauge or ''w.g.'' (inches water gauge). A typical gas-using residential appliance in the US is rated for a maximum of 1/2&amp;nbsp;psi, which is approximately 14&amp;nbsp;w.g. (3487&amp;nbsp;Pa or 34.9&amp;nbsp;millibars). Similar metric units with a wide variety of names and notation based on [[Millimeters, water gauge|millimetres]], [[Centimetre of water|centimetres]] or metres are now less commonly used.

== Boiling point of water ==
[[File:Kochendes wasser02.jpg|thumb|[[Boiling water]]]]
Pure water [[boiling|boils]] at {{convert|100|C}} at earth's standard atmospheric pressure. The boiling point is the temperature at which the [[vapor pressure]] is equal to the atmospheric pressure around the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/vappre.html |title=Vapour Pressure |publisher=Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the boiling point of water is lower at lower pressure and higher at higher pressure. Cooking at high elevations, therefore, requires adjustments to recipes&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.crisco.com/Cooking_Central/Cooking_Tips/Prep_High_Alt.aspx |title=High Altitude Cooking |publisher=Crisco.com |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2012-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907232429/http://www.crisco.com/Cooking_Central/Cooking_Tips/Prep_High_Alt.aspx |archivedate=2012-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[pressure cooking]]. A rough approximation of elevation can be obtained by measuring the temperature at which water boils; in the mid-19th century, this method was used by explorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M. N. |last1=Berberan-Santos |first2=E. N. |last2=Bodunov |first3=L. |last3=Pogliani |title=On the barometric formula |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=404–412 |year=1997 |doi=10.1119/1.18555 |bibcode = 1997AmJPh..65..404B  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and maps ==
An important application of the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains thanks to the availability of reliable pressure measurement devices. In 1774, [[Nevil Maskelyne|Maskelyne]] was [[Schiehallion experiment|confirming Newton's theory of gravitation]] at and on [[Schiehallion]] mountain in Scotland, and he needed to accurately measure elevations on the mountain's sides.  [[William Roy]], using barometric pressure, was able to confirm Maskelyne's height determinations, the agreement being to within one meter (3.28 feet). This method became and continues to be useful for survey work and map making.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Rachel, ''Map of a Nation – a Biography of the Ordnance Survey'' {{ISBN|1-84708-098-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''king''' (♔,♚) is the most important [[chess piece|piece]] in the game of [[chess]]. If a player's king is threatened with capture, it is said to be ''in [[Check (chess)|check]]'', and the player must remove the threat of {{chessgloss|capture}} on the next move. If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in [[checkmate]], resulting in a loss for that player. Players cannot make any move that places their own king in check. Although the king is the most important piece, it is usually the weakest piece in the game until the game's [[Chess endgame|ending phase]].

Each player begins the game with a king in their color. The white king starts the game on e1; the black king starts on e8. Unlike the other pieces, only one king per player can be on the board at any time, and the kings are never removed from the board during the game. 
{{AN chess|pos=toc}}

==Placement and movement==
White starts with the king on e1, on the first {{chessgloss|rank}} to the right of the [[Queen (chess)|queen]]. Black starts with the king on e8, directly across from the white king. The kings always start on a square of opposite color.

A king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), unless the square is already occupied by a friendly piece, or the move would place the king in check. As a result, opposing kings may never occupy adjacent squares (see [[opposition (chess)|opposition]]) to give check, as that would put the moving king in check as well. However, the king can give [[discovered check]] by unblocking a [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]], [[Rook (chess)|rook]], or queen. The king is also involved in the special move of [[castling]].

In conjunction with a [[Rook (chess)|rook]], the king may make a special move called castling. When castling, the king moves two squares toward one of its rooks and that rook is placed on the square over which the king crossed. Castling is allowed only when neither the king nor the castling rook previously moved, no squares between them are occupied, the king is not in check, and the king will not move across or end its movement on a square that is under enemy attack. Castling with the h-file rook is known as ''castling kingside'' or ''short castling'' (denoted O-O in [[Algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic notation]]), which castling with the a-file rook is known as ''castling queenside'' or ''long castling'' (denoted O-O-O).

===Check and checkmate===
{{Main|Check (chess)|Checkmate}}
A king that is under attack is said to be ''in [[check (chess)|check]]'', and the player in check must immediately remedy the situation. There are three possible ways to remove the king from check:
*The king is moved to an adjacent non-threatened square. A king ''cannot'' castle to get out of check. A king can capture an adjacent enemy piece if that piece is not protected by another enemy piece.
*A piece is interposed between the king and the attacking piece to break the line of threat (not possible when the attacking piece is a [[knight (chess)|knight]] or [[pawn (chess)|pawn]], or when in [[double check]]).
*The attacking piece is captured (not possible when in double check, unless the king captures).

If none of the three options are available, the player's king has been ''[[checkmate|checkmated]]'' and the player loses the game.

|Black's king cannot move to squares under attack by the white bishop, knight, queen, or pawn. Since White is checking Black, and Black can neither move, capture the checking piece, nor block the check, Black is checkmated.

===Stalemate===
{{Main|Stalemate}}
A stalemate occurs when a player, on their turn, has no legal moves, and the player's king is not in check.

If this happens, the king is said to have been stalemated and the game ends in a [[draw (chess)|draw]]. A player who has very little or no chance of winning will often, in order to avoid a loss, try to entice the opponent to inadvertently place the player's king in stalemate (see [[Swindle (chess)|swindle]]).

|White to move: White cannot move legally because of the black queen and king. Since the king may not move into check, White is stalemated.

==Role in gameplay==
In the [[Chess opening|opening]] and [[Chess middlegame|middlegame]], the king will rarely play an active role in the development of an offensive or defensive position. Instead, a player will normally try to [[castling|castle]] and seek safety on the edge of the board behind friendly [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]]. In the [[Chess endgame|endgame]], however, the king emerges to play an active role as an offensive piece as well as assisting in the [[Promotion (chess)|promotion]] of their remaining pawns.

It is not meaningful to assign a value to the king relative to the other pieces, as it cannot be captured or [[Exchange (chess)|exchanged]], and must be protected at all costs. In this sense, its value could be considered infinite. As an assessment of the king's capability as an offensive piece in the endgame, it is often considered to be slightly stronger than a bishop or knight&amp;nbsp;– [[Emanuel Lasker]] gave it the value of a knight plus a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]] (i.e. four points on the scale of [[chess piece relative value]]) {{harvcol|Lasker|1934|p=73}}. It is better at defending nearby pawns than the knight is, and it is better at attacking them than the bishop is {{harvcol|Ward|1996|p=13}}.

'''Eldridge Pope &amp; Co.''' was a traditional [[brewery]] situated in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], [[Dorset]]. It originated with a brewery in Durngate Street (on the site of the present Waitrose) run by Charles and Sarah Eldridge from 1837; later, the Pope family of Dorset solicitors entered the business, firstly in the form of a partnership, then as a limited company - Eldridge, Pope &amp; Co. Ltd. - incorporated in 1897. A new brewery was meanwhile built closer to the railway line in 1880, and opened in 1881. The brewery closed in July 2003 following its sale to a property company, and now forms part of the [[Brewery Square, Dorchester|Brewery Square]] development. The pub estate went on to be acquired by [[Marstons]] in 2007, whereupon Eldridge Pope became a dormant company. Most of the brewery was demolished in 2020, 140 years after it was built.

==History==

The origins of Eldridge Pope can be traced back to 1837, when hotel landlord Charles Eldridge  and his wife Sarah bought the Green Dragon Brewery in Durngate Street, Dorchester. Together they turned the brewery into a thriving small business, and following Charles's death in 1846, Sarah continued to run it in partnership with local brewer Samuel Mason, under the trading name 'Eldridge, Mason &amp; Co'.

On his retirement in 1870, Mason sold his stake in the Brewery to Edwin Pope and his younger sibling Alfred Pope. Sarah Eldridge's son-in-law John Tizard inherited her share of the business, but when he died in 1871 the Popes assumed full control.

By 1879 the company had outgrown its Durngate Street premises, and the Pope brothers wanted to build a large new brewery to satisfy their expansion plans for the company. They bought up four acres of land next to the railway line, and commissioned distinguished local architect W. R. Crickmay to design the new structure.

The new brewery was officially opened in 1881, and very quickly became the biggest employer in Dorchester. Sixteen years later the Pope brothers incorporated the business as a private limited company under the name 'Eldridge, Pope &amp; Co. Limited'.

The following decades saw the next generation of the Pope family take over the running of the company. In 1921 Clement Pope, son of Alfred, created the Huntsman trademark, which became one of the most recognizable and popular brands associated with the company.

In 1922 a huge fire ripped through the brewery, damaging much of the brewhouse and several other buildings. It was not until 1925 that the rebuilding work was completed and the brewery was able to produce beer again.

Denis Edwin Holliday was head brewer at Eldridge Pope throughout the 1960s and 70s. This era was associated with the production of popular real ales such as Royal Oak and Thomas Hardy's Ale. Holliday also had an entry in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', 1978 edition, for brewing the strongest commercially brewed beer.

In 1997, the management of the brewery bought the business but not the site. They called their company Thomas Hardy Brewery &amp; Packaging. In 1998, Thomas Hardy acquired another brewery in Burtonwood to form Thomas Hardy Burtonwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomashardybrewery.co.uk/content/history-investments |title=History &amp; Investments |website=Thomashardybrewery.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Thomas Hardy Burtonwood offered to buy the site from Eldridge Pope for £8m but the offer was declined. Instead, Eldridge Pope sold the site to property company Landworth Properties. Landworth then raised the rent to what the brewery felt to be an uneconomic level causing it to cease its business there with the loss of 57 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=24-Jul-2003 |url=http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Drinks/Beer/Thomas-Hardy-Brewery-shuts-with-loss-of-57-jobs |title=Thomas Hardy Brewery shuts with loss of 57 jobs |website=Morningadvertiser.co.uk |date=2003-07-24 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year after the brewery's closure, the family lost control of the business to pubs entrepreneur Michael Cannon who acquired the pubs for £40m plus £42m debt. He identified the need for a three-year, £14m investment programme and a focus on increasing disappointing food sales. He injected his Que Pasa bar chain into the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Simon Bowers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/sep/17/7 |title=Cannon buys Eldridge Pope for £42m &amp;#124; Business |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company continued to operate for a further three years under Michael Cannon's management. In January 2007, the assets of Eldridge Pope &amp; Co. Limited were sold to [[Marstons]] plc for £155m. Michael Cannon and his fellow shareholders who included several members of the Pope family made a return of 2.8 times his original investment after turning the business around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2803276/Cannon-sells-Eldridge-Pope-to-Marstons-for-155m.html |title=Cannon sells Eldridge Pope to Marston's for £155m |newspaper=Telegraph |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of the Eldridge Pope brewery was subsequently developed into a thriving quarter of Dorchester with restaurants, shops, apartments, a cinema, gym and a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;https://brewerysquare.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
In 1985, the brewery's founder, Sarah Eldridge was the subject of ''Entertaining Strangers: A play for Dorchester'' by the playwright [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] and produced as a community play by the people of Dorchester, In 1987 the play was transferred to [[Royal National Theatre|The National Theatre]], with [[Judi Dench]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theatricalia.com/play/7pb/entertaining-strangers/production/s5e|title=Production of Entertaining Strangers {{!}} Theatricalia|website=theatricalia.com|access-date=2019-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the role of Sarah Eldridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/nov/14/theatre1|title=Playwright David Edgar on a Dorset drama that just keeps on growing|last=Staff|first=Guardian|date=2007-11-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-07-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Hürtgen Forest''' ({{lang-de|Schlacht im Hürtgenwald}}) was a series of fierce battles fought from 19 September to 16 December 1944, between [[United States Army|American]] and [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] during [[World War II]], in the [[Huertgen forest|Hürtgen Forest]], a {{convert|140|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} area about {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the Belgian–German border.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zabecki&quot;/&gt; It was the longest battle on German ground during World War II and is the longest single battle the U.S. Army has ever fought.&lt;ref name= Regan&gt;Regan, ''More military blunders,'' p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. commanders' initial goal was to pin down German forces in the area to keep them from reinforcing the front lines farther north in the [[Battle of Aachen]], where the US forces were fighting against the [[Siegfried Line]] network of fortified industrial towns and villages speckled with pillboxes, tank traps, and minefields. A secondary objective may have been to [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] the front line.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The Americans' initial tactical objectives were to take Schmidt and clear [[Monschau]]. In a second phase the Allies wanted to advance to the [[Rur|Rur River]] as part of [[Operation Queen]].

''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Walter Model]] intended to bring the Allied thrust to a standstill. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of units than at the [[Battle of Arnhem]], he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, slowing the Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties, and taking full advantage of the fortifications the Germans called the ''Westwall'', better known to the Allies as the ''Siegfried Line''. The Hürtgen Forest cost the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] at least 33,000 killed and wounded, including both combat and non-combat losses, with upper estimate at 55,000; German casualties were 28,000. The city of Aachen in the north eventually fell on 22 October at high cost to the [[Ninth United States Army|U.S. Ninth Army]], but they failed to cross the Rur or wrest control of its dams from the Germans. The battle was so costly that it has been described as an Allied &quot;defeat of the first magnitude,&quot; with specific credit given to Model.&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, ''Battle of Hurtgen Forest,'' pp.xi-xiv, 271–274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcdonald&quot;/&gt;{{rp|391}}

The Germans fiercely defended the area because it served as a staging area for the 1944 winter offensive ''Unternehmen: Wacht am Rhein'' (later known as the [[Battle of the Bulge]]), and because the mountains commanded access to the [[Rur Dam]]&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The Rur Dam holds back the [[Rurstausee]] and is the major structure in a network. Upstream are other, smaller, structures: the Paulushof Dam holding the Obersee and the Urft Dam holding the Urfttalsperre. If the floodgates were opened, the resulting surge would flood low-lying areas downstream and temporarily prevent forces from crossing the river.&lt;/ref&gt; at the head of the Rur Reservoir (Rurstausee). The Allies failed to capture the area after several heavy setbacks, and the Germans successfully held the region until they launched their last-ditch offensive into the [[Ardennes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whiting&quot;&gt;Whiting p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; This was launched on 16 December and ended the Hürtgen offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zabecki&quot;/&gt; The Battle of the Bulge gained widespread press and public attention, leaving the battle of Hürtgen Forest less well remembered.

The overall cost of the Siegfried Line Campaign in American personnel was close to 140,000.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Charles B. ''The Siegfried Line Campaign''. Ch. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
By mid-September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] pursuit of the German army after the [[Normandy landings|landings at Normandy]] was slowing down due to extended supply lines and increasing German resistance. The next strategic objective was to move up to the [[Rhine|Rhine River]] along its entire length and prepare to cross it. [[Courtney Hodges]]′ [[First United States Army|First Army]] experienced hard resistance pushing through the Aachen Gap and perceived a potential threat from enemy forces using the Hürtgen Forest as a base.

The [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Infantry Division]] arrived in early October, joining elements of the [[XIX Corps (United States)|XIX Corps]] and [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]], which had encircled Aachen. Although the 1st Infantry Division called for the surrender of the German garrison in the city, German commander ''[[Oberst]]'' [[Gerhard Wilck]] refused to capitulate until 22 October.

The Allies also thought it was necessary to remove the threat posed by the Rur Dam. The stored water could be released by the Germans, swamping any forces operating downstream. In the view of the American commanders, [[Omar Bradley|Bradley]], [[Courtney Hodges|Hodges]], and [[J. Lawton Collins|Collins]], the direct route to the dam was through the forest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neillands&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Neillands|first= Robin|authorlink=|title=The Battle for the Rhine 1945|publisher=Orion Publishing Group| year=2005|location=London|url=|doi=|isbn=0-297-84617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|239}}

Some military historians are no longer convinced by these arguments. [[Charles B. MacDonald]] — a U.S. Army historian and former company commander who served in the Hürtgen battle — has described it as &quot;...a misconceived and basically fruitless battle that should have been avoided.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neillands&quot;/&gt;{{rp|239}}

== Geography ==
[[File:Karte Huertgenwald.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Map showing the area of the battle]] [[File:Huertgen Forest.jpg|thumb|250px|View to the west over the Kall Valley.]]

The Hürtgen Forest occupies a rugged area between the [[Rur]] River and Aachen. In the autumn and early winter of 1944, the weather was cold, wet, and cloudy, and often prevented air support. Apart from the poor weather, the dense forest and rough terrain also prevented proper use of Allied air superiority, which had great difficulties in spotting any targets. The dense conifer forest is broken by few roads, tracks, and firebreaks; vehicular movement is restricted. Conditions on the ground became a muddy morass, further impeding vehicular traffic, especially heavy vehicles such as tanks.

The German defenders had prepared the area with improvised blockhouses, minefields, barbed wire, and booby-traps, hidden by the mud and snow. There were also numerous concrete bunkers in the area, mostly belonging to the deep defenses of the [[Siegfried Line]], which were also centers of resistance. The dense forest allowed infiltration and flanking attacks, and it was sometimes difficult to establish a front line or to be confident that an area had been cleared of the enemy. The small numbers of routes and clearings in the forest had also allowed German machine gun, mortar, and artillery teams to pre-range their weapons and fire accurately. 

The American advantage in numbers (as high as 5:1), armor, mobility, and air support was thus greatly reduced by weather and terrain. In the forest, relatively small numbers of determined and prepared defenders could be highly effective. To exacerbate matters, as the American divisions took casualties, inexperienced replacements had to be fed directly into combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcdonald&quot;&gt;MacDonald, Charles B. ''Siegfried Line Campaign''. (1984). Center of Military History, United States Army. Pages 454, 468–469.&lt;/ref&gt;

The densely forested terrain also limited the use of tanks and provided cover for German anti-tank teams equipped with ''[[panzerfaust]]'' shaped-charge grenade launchers. The Allies made improvised rocket launchers, using rocket tubes from aircraft and spare Jeep trailers. Later in the battle, it proved necessary to blast tank routes through the forest. Transportation was similarly limited by the lack of routes: at critical times, it proved difficult to reinforce or supply front-line units or to evacuate the dead and wounded.

The Germans were hampered by much the same difficulties, worsened because their divisions had already taken heavy losses on the retreat through France and were hastily filled up with untrained boys and old men, often unfit for normal military service. Transportation was also a problem, because of the difficult roads and the lack of trucks and fuel; most supplies had to be manhandled to the front line. Nonetheless, despite increasing numbers of replacements lacking experience, German defenders had the advantage in that their commanders and many of their soldiers had been fighting for years and had learned the necessary tactics for fighting efficiently in winter and forested areas, whereas the Americans were often well-trained but inexperienced.

== Opposing armies ==
The Hürtgen Forest lay within the area of the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] under the command of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Courtney Hodges]]. Responsibility fluctuated between the [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]].

At the start, the forest was defended by the German 275th and 353rd Infantry Divisions; understrength but well prepared — 5,000 men (1,000 in reserve) — and commanded by ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Hans Schmidt (general)|Hans Schmidt]]. They had little artillery and no tanks. As the battle progressed, German reinforcements were added. American expectations that these troops were weak and ready to withdraw were overly optimistic.

==Battle==
===First Phase===
The 9th Infantry Division's ultimate objective was Rur River crossings at [[Düren]]. On September 14, 1944, an attack by the 47th Infantry Regiment captured [[Schevenhütte]], on the northern fringes of the forest, with few casualties. The division had surprised the Germans, but lacked the strength to push on as two of their regiments were committed to the south. Attacks on and around the Höfen-Alzen ridge by the 39th and 60th Infantry Regiments were met with heavy resistance and pushed back. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 39th captured Lammersdorf, but could not dislodge enemies entrenched in the woods behind the village; the 3rd Battalion suffered heavy losses attacking Hill 554, near Lammersdorf. In these early engagements, the 9th Infantry Division was unable to eject the Germans from the periphery of the forest, and decided to push through it to the northeast and capture [[Hürtgen]] and Kleinhau. The engagement began on September 19, 1944. Repeated probes entered the forest toward their objective, but were beaten back by the terrain and Germans dug into prepared positions. On October 5, the 39th and 60th Infantry Regiments attacked towards the town of Schmidt while the 47th held a defensive position. The [[Monschau]]-Düren road was quickly cut, but both regiments were slowed by defenses and suffered significant casualties: The 60th's 2nd Battalion was reduced to a third after the first day. The 39th was halted at the Weisser Weh Creek; there were problems with narrow paths, air bursts in trees, and fire breaks which were blocked or [[enfiladed]]. Evacuation and supply was difficult or impossible. By 16 October, {{convert|3000|yd|m|abbr=on}} had been gained at the cost of 4,500 casualties. The [[U.S. 28th Infantry Division]] — a [[Pennsylvania]] [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] unit - arrived on 16 October, to relieve the battered 9th.

The 28th Division was reinforced with the attached 707th Tank Battalion, tracked [[M29 Weasel]] transport and air support. Of its three regiments, one was deployed to protect the northern flank, another to attack Germeter, and the third to capture Schmidt, the main objective. The area had terrible terrain with the [[Kall, Germany|Kall]] Trail running along a deep river ravine. The terrain was not suited to tanks, despite the need for armor to support the infantry.

The attack by the 28th Division started on 2 November; the defenders were expecting it and were ready. The [[U.S. 109th Infantry Regiment]], assigned to capture the woods north of Germeter, was impeded after 300 yards by an unexpected minefield (the &quot;Wild Pig&quot;), pinned down by mortar and artillery fire and harassed by local [[counterattack]]s. Just one mile was gained after two days, after which the 109th dug in and endured casualties. This initial attack was nearly all the ground the 109th would take during the battle. The [[110th Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 110th Infantry Regiment]] had to clear the woods next to the Kall River, capture Simonskall, and maintain a supply route for the advance on Schmidt: Again, these were very difficult tasks due to weather, prepared defenses, determined defenders, and terrain. The weather prevented tactical air support until 5 November.

The [[U.S. 112th Infantry Regiment]], attacking from Germeter, took Vossenack and the neighboring ridge by the afternoon. The 112th was then halted by strong defenses and difficult terrain. The 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 112th moved across the Kall Valley and captured Kommerscheidt and Schmidt, respectively, on 3 November. The German supply route to Monschau was cut, but American supply, reinforcement, and evacuation were very limited as the Kall Trail had poor terrain and was infiltrated by the Germans. At dawn on November 4, a strong German counter-attack by tanks of the [[116th Panzer Division]] and a chance encirclement by troops from the 89th Infantry Division rapidly expelled the 3rd Battalion from Schmidt, and they were unable to counter-attack. The battalion disintegrated after constant shelling and a fierce attack by the 116th Panzer Division and some men inadvertently fled east, to be captured by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1995) p70&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the battalion retreated to Kommerscheidt to join the 112th's 1st Battalion. Realizing the gravity of the situation, eight [[M4 Sherman]]s of Company A, 707th Tank Battalion attempted to cross the Kall Valley, but only three actually made it across to support the beleaguered 112th. The 116th Panzer Division again attacked with tanks and infantry several times. The American tanks, along with infantry and air support, destroyed five German [[Panzer IV]] tanks. At Vossenack, the 112th's 2nd Battalion was nearly forced out of the town on November 6 by a fierce German counterattack, but were assisted by engineers in retaking the western part of the town. The Americans across the Kall Valley at Kommerscheidt held on until November 8, when an order to withdraw was given.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1995) p83-84&lt;/ref&gt; The positions at Schmidt and the Kall Trail were abandoned. It wasn't until February 1945 that the [[82nd Airborne Division]] permanently captured the Kall Trail and Schmidt.

A German regimental doctor, ''Hauptmann'' Günter Stüttgen, negotiated an unofficial ceasefire with the Americans at the Kall Bridge from 7–12 November, in order to attend to the wounded of both sides, numbering in the thousands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortblissbugle.com/monitor/2018/03march/030118/pdf/030118part1a.pdf Marcy Sanchez ''Fort Bliss Bugle'' (03 March 2018) WBAMC’s Troop Command welcomes new CSM], p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The lives of many American soldiers were saved by German medics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Konejung Stiftung: Kultur&quot;&gt;[http://www.konejung-stiftung.de/ATimeForHealing.htm Konejung Stiftung: Kultur]&lt;/ref&gt;

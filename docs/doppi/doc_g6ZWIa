===Air pressure and the vacuum===
In 1650 von Guericke invented the [[vacuum pump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harsch|first=Viktor|date=November 2007|title=Otto von Gericke (1602–1686) and his pioneering vacuum experiments|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18018443/|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume=78|issue=11|pages=1075–1077|doi=10.3357/asem.2159.2007|issn=0095-6562|pmid=18018443}}&lt;/ref&gt; His model consisting of a piston and an [[Air gun#History|air gun cylinder]] with two-way flaps designed to pull air out of whatever vessel it was connected to, and used it to investigate the properties of the vacuum in many experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Chapters II and III of Book III of the ''Experimenta Nova'' and ''Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica'', pp.&amp;nbsp;445–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Guericke demonstrated the force of [[air pressure]] with dramatic experiments.

In 1657, he machined two 20-inch diameter hemispheres and pumped all the air out of them, locking them together with a vacuum seal. The air pressure outside held the halves together so tightly that sixteen horses, eight harnessed to each side of the globe, could not pull the halves apart. It would have required more than 4,000 pounds of force to separate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John | last=Lienhard  | title=Rain Steam &amp; Speed | chapter=Gases and Force | year=2005 | publisher=[[KUHF]] FM Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that by pumping the air out of these spheres, he was able to create internal pressures roughly equal to 1/25 of an [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

With his experiments Guericke disproved the hypothesis of &quot;[[horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]]&quot;, that nature abhors a vacuum. Aristotle (e.g. in ''Physics'' IV 6–9) had argued against the existence of the void and his views commanded near-universal endorsement by philosophers and scientists up to the 17th century. Guericke showed that substances were not pulled by a vacuum, but were pushed by the pressure of the surrounding fluids.&lt;ref name=&quot;GrantGrant1981&quot;/&gt;

All of von Guericke's work on the vacuum and air pressure is described in Book III of the ''Experimenta Nova'' (1672). As regards the more detailed chronology of his work we have, in addition to the ''Experimenta Nova''{{'}}s description of his demonstrations at Regensburg in 1654, the two accounts published by Fr. Schott in 1657 and 1663.{{sfn|Schneider|2002|p=98}}

In Chapter 27 he alludes to what transpired at Regensburg in 1654. The first experiment he explicitly records as having been demonstrated was the crushing of a non-spherical vessel as the air was withdrawn from it. He did not use a vacuum pump directly on the vessel, but allowed the air in it to expand into a previously evacuated receiver.

[[Image:Magdeburger-Halbkugeln.jpg|thumb|270px|right|[[Engraving]] of the Magdeburg hemispheres experiment by Caspar Schott]]
The second was an experiment in which a number of men proved able to pull an airtight piston only about halfway up a cylindrical copper vessel. Von Guericke then attached his evacuated receiver to the space below the piston and succeeded in drawing the piston back down again against the force of the men pulling it up. In a letter to Friar Schott of June 1656, reproduced in ''Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;454–55), von Guericke gives a short account of his experiences at Regensburg. Based on this, Schimank [1936] gives a list of ten experiments that he considers likely to have been carried out at Regensburg. In addition to the above two, these included the extraction of air using a vacuum pump, the extinction of a flame in a sealed vessel, the raising of water by suction, a demonstration that air has weight, and a demonstration of how fog and mist can be produced in a sealed vessel. The ''Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica'' also provides the earliest drawing of von Guericke's vacuum pump. This corresponds to the description in the opening chapters of Book III of the ''Experimenta Nova'' of the first version of his pump.

Stimulated by the interest taken in his work, von Guericke was scientifically very active in the decade after 1654. In June 1656 we find him writing to Fr. Schott (''Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica'', p.&amp;nbsp;444) &quot;Since the time when I produced the exhibition for the said eminent Elector, I have a better and clearer grasp of all these matters and many other topics as well.&quot; The celebrated hemispheres experiment was, as noted in the biographical section above, carried out between July 1656 and August 1657. In Chapter IV of Book III he describes a new and much-improved design of vacuum pump and attributes its invention to the need for a more easily transportable machine with which he could demonstrate his experiments to Frederick William, who had expressed the desire to see them. The new pump is also described on p.&amp;nbsp;67 of the ''[[Technica Curiosa]]''. The demonstration in the Elector's Library at [[Cölln]] an der Spree took place in November 1663 and was recorded by a tutor to the Elector's sons. (Schneider p.&amp;nbsp;113.) A number of experiments, such as the rather cruel testing of the effect of a vacuum on birds and fish (''Experimenta Nova'', Book III, Chapter XVI), are not described in the ''Technica Curiosa''. Although the ''Experimenta Nova'' does contain correspondence from 1665, there is no reason to doubt von Guericke's assertion that the work was essentially finished by March 1663.

Throughout Books II and III he returns again and again to the theme of there being no abhorrence of a vacuum and that all the phenomena explained by this supposed principle are in fact attributable to the pressure of the atmosphere in conjunction with various incorporeal potencies which he held to be acting. Thus the Earth's &quot;conservative potency&quot; (''virtus conservativa'') provided the explanation for the fact that the Earth retains its atmosphere though travelling through space. In countering the objection of a Dr. Deusing that the weight of the atmosphere would simply crush the bodies of all living things, he shows explicit awareness of the key property of a fluid – that it exerts pressure equally across all planes. In Chapter XXX of Book III he writes: &quot;Dr. Deusing ought to have borne in mind that the air does not just press on our heads but flows all around us. Just as it presses from above on the head, it likewise presses on the soles of the feet from below and simultaneously on all parts of the body from all directions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GrantGrant1981&quot;/&gt;

====Relevant research====
In the ''Experimenta Nova'', Book III, Chapter 20, von Guericke reports on a [[barometer]] he had constructed and its application to weather forecasting. The earliest reference to his barometer is in a letter to Fr. Schott of November 1661 (''Technica Curiosa'', p.&amp;nbsp;37) where he writes: &quot;I have observed the variation in the weight of the air by using a little man (i.e. a statue in the form of one) who hangs from a wall in my hypocaust where it floats on air in a glass tube and uses a finger to show the weight or lightness of the air. At the same time it indicates whether or not it is raining in nearby localities or whether there is unusually stormy weather at sea.&quot; In a subsequent letter of December 30, 1661 (''Technica Curiosa'' p.&amp;nbsp;52) he gives a somewhat amplified account. His barometer thus prepared the way for [[meteorology]]. His later works focused on electricity. He invented the &quot;Elektrisiermaschine&quot;, a version of which is illustrated in the engraving by [[Hubert-François Gravelot]], c. 1750. This device, which is usually identified as the first [[electrostatic generator]], was developed as part of von Guericke's interest in the worldly powers (''mundane virtues'') that operated in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heathcote|first1=N.H. de V.|title=Guericke's sulphur globe|journal=Annals of Science|year=1950|volume=6|issue=3|page=299|doi=10.1080/00033795000201981}} {{cite book |title=Electricity in the 17th and 18th centuries: a study of early Modern physics |last=Heilbron |authorlink=John L.

===Electrostatic investigations===
[[Image:Guericke Sulfur globe.jpg|thumb|left|Guericke's experiments with the sulfur globe published 1672]]
Von Guericke thought of the capacity of body to exert an influence beyond its immediate boundaries in terms of &quot;corporeal and incorporeal potencies&quot;. Examples of &quot;corporeal potencies&quot; were the giving off of fumes, smells, gases etc. by bodies. An example of an &quot;incorporeal potencies&quot; was the Earth's &quot;conservative potency&quot; whereby it retained its atmosphere and caused the return of objects thrown upwards to the Earth's surface. The Earth also possessed an &quot;expulsive potency&quot; which was deemed to explain why objects that fall bounce back up again. The notion of an &quot;incorporeal potency&quot; is similar to that of &quot;action at a distance&quot;, except the former notion remained purely qualitative and there is no inkling of the fundamental &quot;action and reaction&quot; principle.{{sfn|Fischer|2002|p=237}}

Von Guericke describes his work on electrostatics in Chapter 15 of Book IV of the ''Experimenta Nova''. In a letter of November 1661 to Fr. Schott, reproduced in the ''Technica Curiosa'', he notes that the then projected Book IV would be concerned with &quot;cosmic potencies&quot; (''virtutes mundanae''). Accepting the claim of the preface to the ''Experimenta Nova'' that the entire work had been essentially completed before March 1663, von Guericke can be fairly credited with inventing a primitive form of [[frictional electrical machine]] before 1663. His electrostatic generator was created using a sulphur globe attached to an iron rod. By rubbing the sphere with a dry hand, von Guericke was able to impart a charge imbalance on the surface, which would allow him to attract and repel other objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;/&gt;

In Chapter 6 of Book IV von Guericke writes: &quot;It seems reasonable to suppose that if the Earth has a fitting and appropriate attractive potency it will also have a potency of repelling things that might be dangerous or disagreeable to it. This is to be seen in the case of the sulphur sphere described below in Chapter 15. When that sphere is stroked or rubbed not only does it attract all light objects, but it sometimes arbitrarily also repels them before attracting them again. Sometimes indeed it doesn't even attract them again.&quot; Von Guericke was aware of both Gilbert's book ''On the Magnet and Magnetic bodies and on the great magnet the Earth'' published in 1600 and of the Jesuit [[Niccolo Cabeo]]'s ''Philosophia Magnetica'' (1629). He does not explicitly acknowledge any anticipation of his demonstration of electrostatic repulsion by the latter but, as he quotes a passage from the same page, could not have been unaware that, in a discussion of the nature of electrical attraction, Cabeo had written (''Philosophia Magnetica'', p.&amp;nbsp;192): &quot;When we see that small bodies (''corpuscula'') are lifted (''sublevari et attolli'') above the amber and also fall back to the motionless amber, it cannot be said that such erratic behaviour (''talem matum'' – but if &quot;matum&quot; is taken as a misprint for &quot;motum&quot;, then the translation is simply &quot;such motion&quot;) is an attraction by the gravity of the attracting body.&quot; In Book IV, Chapter 8 of the ''Experimenta Nova'' von Guericke is at pains to point out the difference between his own &quot;incorporeal potency&quot; views and Cabeo's more Aristotelian conclusions. He writes: &quot;Writers who have written on magnetism, always confuse it with electrical attraction, although there is a great difference. In particular, Gilbert in his book ''De Magnete'' claims that electrical attraction is caused by the effluence of a humour, that the humid seeks the humid and this is the cause of the attraction. Moreover in ''Philosophia Magnetica'', Book 2, Chapter 21, Cabeo criticises Gilbert but does admit that this attraction is created by the agency of an effluent. Humidity does not play any role but the attraction is brought about purely by the agency of an effluent, by which the air is disturbed. After the initial impulse, the air returns to the amber again taking with it little particles. He (Cabeo) concludes by saying: 'I say therefore that from amber or any other electrically attracting body, a very rarefied effluent is emitted which dispels and attenuates the air, extremely agitating it. Then the agitated and attenuated air returns to the amber body sweeping along with it whatever dust or small bodies are in its way'. We however, who in the previous chapter, take the attraction of the sulphur ball as electrical in nature and operating through a conservative potency, cannot admit that the air plays a role in producing the attraction. Experiment visibly shows that this sulphur globe (once it has been rubbed) also exercises its potency through a linen cord up to a range of a cubit and more and can attract at that distance.&quot; Unknown to them at the time, this &quot;mysterious&quot; attraction and repulsion they had been witnessing was actually [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conduction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

The key Chapter 15 is titled &quot;On an experiment, in which these potencies, listed above, can be evoked by the rubbing of a sulphur ball.&quot; In Section 3 of this chapter, he describes how light bodies are repelled from a sulphur sphere which has been rubbed with a dry hand, and are not again attracted until they have touched another body. Oldenburg's review of the ''Experimenta Nova'' (November 1672) in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Society'' sceptically observes: &quot;How far this globe may be confided in, the Tryals and Consideration of some ingenious person here may perhaps inform us hereafter.&quot; In fact, Robert Boyle repeated von Guericke's experiments for the Royal Society in November 1672 and February 1673.{{sfn|Fischer|2002|p=237}}{{sfn|Schneider|2002|p=127}}

In an [[optical fiber]], the '''material dispersion coefficient''', ''M''(λ), characterizes the amount of [[pulse broadening]] by material [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] per unit length of fiber and per unit of [[spectral width]]. It is usually expressed in [[picosecond]]s per ([[nanometre]]·[[kilometre]]). 

For many optical fiber materials, ''M''(λ) approaches zero at a specific [[wavelength]] λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; between 1.3  and 1.5 [[μm]]. At wavelengths shorter than λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''(λ) is negative and increases with wavelength; at wavelengths longer than λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''(λ) is positive and decreases with wavelength. 

Pulse broadening caused by material dispersion in a unit length of optical fiber is given by the product of ''M''(λ) and [[spectral width]] (Δλ).

A '''light pen''' is a [[computer]] [[input device]] in the form of a light-sensitive wand used in conjunction with a computer's [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) display.

It allows the user to point to displayed objects or draw on the screen in a similar way to a [[touchscreen]] but with greater positional accuracy.  A light pen can work with any CRT-based display, but its ability to be used with [[Liquid-crystal display|LCDs]] was unclear (though Toshiba and Hitachi displayed a similar idea at the &quot;Display 2006&quot; show in Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-12 |date=2006-04-20 |title=Slashphone Article |url=http://www.slashphone.com/69/4156.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120031505/http://www.slashphone.com/69/4156.html |archivedate=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A light pen detects changes in brightness of nearby screen pixels when scanned by [[cathode-ray tube]] electron beam and communicates the timing of this event to the computer. Since a CRT scans the entire screen one pixel at a time, the computer can keep track of the expected time of scanning various locations on screen by the beam and infer the pen's position from the latest timestamp.

== History ==

The first light pen was created around 1955 as part of the [[Whirlwind I|Whirlwind]] project at [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first more widely deployed uses was in the Situation Display consoles of the [[AN/FSQ-7]] for military airspace surveillance. This is not very surprising, given its relationship with the Whirlwind projects. See [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment]] for more details.

During the 1960s, light pens were common on graphics terminals such as the [[IBM 2250]] and were also available for the [[IBM 3270]] text-only terminal.

Light pen usage was expanded in the early 1980s to music workstations such as the [[Fairlight CMI]] and personal computers such as the [[BBC Micro]]. [[IBM PC]] compatible [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], [[Hercules Graphics Card|HGC]] and some [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] graphics cards also featured a connector compatible with a light pen, as did early Tandy 1000 computers,&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;For example, the Tandy 1000 SX has a DE-9 light pen conector on the rear panel; on the later-introduced Tandy 1000 TX, this light pen interface has been replaced with a serial port using the same connector in the same location.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Thomson MO5]] computer family, the [[Atari 8-bit]], [[:Category:Commodore 8-bit family|Commodore 8-bit]], some [[MSX]] computers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2019-05-16|title=MSX Wiki (entry for Light Pen)|url=https://www.msx.org/wiki/Light_pen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amstrad PCW]] home computers. For the [[MSX]] computers, [[Sanyo]] produced a light pen interface cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanyo MLP-01 on Generation MSX |url=https://www.generation-msx.nl/hardware/sanyo/mlp-01/668/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the user was required to hold their arm in front of the screen for long periods of time (potentially causing &quot;[[Touchscreen#&quot;Gorilla arm&quot;|gorilla arm]]&quot;) or to use a desk that tilts the monitor, the light pen fell out of use as a general-purpose input device.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In [[telecommunication]], an '''''n''-ary code''' is a [[code]] that has ''n'' significant conditions, where ''n'' is a positive integer greater than 1.   The integer substituted for ''n'' indicates the specific number of significant conditions, ''i.e.'', [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] states, in the code. For example, an 8-ary code has eight significant conditions and can convey three bits per code symbol. A prefix that indicates an integer, ''e.g.'', &quot;bin&quot;, &quot;tern,&quot; or &quot;quatern&quot;, may be used in lieu of a numeral, to produce &quot;[[binary numeral system|binary]]&quot;, [[ternary signal|&quot;ternary&quot;]], or [[Quaternary numeral system|&quot;quaternary&quot;]] (2, 3, and 4 states respectively).

'''RealMedia''' is a proprietary [[multimedia]] [[container format (digital)|container format]] created by [[RealNetworks]]. Its extension is &quot;.rm&quot;. It is typically used in conjunction with [[RealVideo]] and [[RealAudio]] and is used for [[Streaming media|streaming]] content over the Internet. Typically these streams are in CBR ([[constant bitrate]]), but a container for VBR ([[variable bitrate]]) streams, named [[RMVB]] (RealMedia variable bitrate), has been developed.

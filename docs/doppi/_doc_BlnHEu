A closely allied tribe, the [[Meskwaki|Meskwaki (Fox)]], were noted for resisting French encroachment, having fought two [[Fox Wars|wars]] against them in the early 18th century. After a devastating battle of 9 September 1730, in Illinois, in which hundreds of warriors were killed and many women and children taken captive by French allies, Fox refugees took shelter with the Sac. This made them subject to French attack in turn.  The Sac continued moving west to [[Iowa]] and [[Kansas]]. [[Keokuk (Sauk chief)|Keokuk]] and [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]] were two important leaders who arose among the Sauk. At first Keokuk accepted the loss of land as inevitable in the face of the vast numbers of white soldiers and settlers coming west. He tried to preserve tribal land and his people, and to keep the peace.

Having failed to receive expected supplies from the Americans on credit, Black Hawk wanted to fight, saying his people were &quot;forced into war by being deceived&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/black_hawk/british_war.htm J. B. Patterson, ''Autobiography of Black Hawk or Ma-Ka-Tai-Me-She-Kia-Kiak'', 1882, Access Genealogy] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120723020904/http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/black_hawk/british_war.htm |date=23 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by Black Hawk in 1832, the mainly Sac band resisted the continued loss of lands (in western Illinois, this time.) Their warfare with United States forces resulted in defeat at the hands of General [[Edmund P. Gaines]] in the [[Black Hawk War]].

About this time, one group of Sac moved into Missouri, and later to Kansas and Nebraska. In 1869, after the Civil War, the United States forced the larger group of Sac to move into [[Indian reservations|a reservation]] in [[Indian Territory]] (now the state of [[Oklahoma]]). They merged with the Meskwaki as the federally recognized [[Sac and Fox Nation]]. (The United States had been making treaties with the two tribes together since their residency in the Midwest.) A smaller number returned to the Midwest from Oklahoma (or resisted leaving.) They joined the Mesquakie at the [[Mesqwaki Settlement, Iowa]].

==Clan system==
The Sauk and Fox peoples were divided into two [[Moiety (kinship)|moieties]] or &quot;divisions&quot;, which in turn were subdivided into [[Lineage (anthropology)|Patri-lineages]] and [[Clan]]s as local subgroups (segments).

The moieties were known as the '''''Kishko/Ki-sko-ha/Kîshkôha''''' (male: ''Kîshkôha'', female: ''Kîshkôhkwêha'') (&quot;the long-haired&quot;) and as the '''''Oskush/Askasa/Shkasha''''' (male: ''Shkasha/Oshkashîwiwa'', female: ''Shkashîhkwêwa/Oshkashîhkwêwiwa'') (&quot;the brave&quot;). The two moieties were each symbolized by two colors: The ''Askasa/Shkasha'' painted their faces and partly their bodies with charcoal in ''mahkatêwâwi'' (black) and the ''Ki-sko-ha/Kîshkôha'' painted their bodies with white clay in ''wâpeshkyâwi'' (white). This duality was also celebrated by the two moieties in the oft extremely brutally played [[History of lacrosse|Lacrosse]] toughen young warriors for combat, for recreation, as part of festivals, and used as preparation for imminent wars or raids.

This division has survived to the present day, but is now more related to the political system of the United States: the supporters of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] are associated with the ''Kîshkôha/Kîshkôhkwêha'', while the supporters of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] are associated with the ''Shkasha/Shkashîhkwêwa''.

Originally, the Sauk had a [[patrilineal]] and [[Exogamy|exogamous]] [[totem|clan system]], in which descent and inheritance was traced through the father. Clans or ''Mîthonî'' distinguished and named on the basis of totem animals, which are: ''Mahkwithowa'' (Bear Clan), ''Amehkwithowa'' (Beaver Clan), ''Peshekethiwithowa'' (Deer Clan), ''Ketiwithowa / Mekethiwithowa'' (Eagle Clan), ''Nemêthithowa'' (Fish Clan), ''Wâkoshêhithowa'' (Fox Clan), ''Kehchikamîwithowa'' (Ocean/Sea/Great Lake Clan), ''Keshêhokimâwithowa'' (Peace Clan), ''Ahpenîthowa'' (Potato Clan), ''Akônithowa'' (Snow Clan), ''Nenemehkiwithowa'' (Thunder Clan), ''Manethenôkimâwithowa'' (Warrior Clan), and ''Mahwêwithowa'' (Wolf Clan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacandfoxnation-nsn.gov/sites/sfnation/uploads/documents/Departments/language/Concise_Dictionary.pdf Gordon Whittaker: A Concise Dictionary of the Sauk Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saukenuk''' or '''Saukietown''' (today: [[Black Hawk State Historic Site]]) near the mouth of the [[Rock River (Mississippi River tributary)|Rock River]] (''Sinnissippi'' - &quot;rocky waters&quot;) into the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] (''Mäse'sibowi'' - &quot;great river&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[https://decolonialatlas.wordpress.com/2014/11/25/st-louis-in-the-fox-language/ The Decolonial Atlas - St. Louis in the Fox Language]&lt;/ref&gt; the most important Sauk settlement in the 18th and 19th centuries with about 4,000 inhabitants, was divided into 12 districts, which were assigned to the respective clans.

The tribe was governed by a council of sacred clan chiefs, a war chief, the head of families, and the warriors. Chiefs were recognized in three categories: civil, war, and ceremonial. Only the civil chiefs were hereditary. The other two chiefs were recognized by bands after they demonstrated their ability or spiritual power.

This traditional manner of selecting historic clan chiefs and governance was replaced in the 19th century by the United States appointing leaders through their agents at the Sac and Fox Agency, or reservation in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). In the 20th century, the tribe adopted a constitutional government patterned after the United States form. They elect their chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sacandfoxnation-nsn.gov/departments/government/|title=Government - Sac &amp; Fox Nation|date=2009|website=Sac &amp; Fox Nation|access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Fox language}}
Sauk is one of the many [[Algonquian languages]]. It is very closely related to the varieties spoken by the [[Meskwaki language|Meskwaki]] and the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] tribes; linguists often describe these three as dialects of the same language. Each of the dialects contains archaisms and innovations that distinguish them from each other. Sauk and Meskwaki appear to be the most closely related of the three, reflecting the peoples' long relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sturtevant|editor1-first=William, C.|editor2-last=Trigger|editor2-first=Bruce G.|last=Goddard|title=Handbook of North American Indians|volume=15: Northeast|place=Washington D.C.|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|first=Ives|chapter=Central Algonquin languages|pages=583–587}} (As quoted in Reinschmidt 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Sauk is considered to be mutually intelligible, to a point, with [[Fox language|Fox]].

In their own language, the Sauk at one time called themselves ''asakiwaki'' [a-‘sak-i-wa-ki], &quot;people of the outlet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonvillain|first=Nancy|year=1995|title=The Sac and Fox|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|pages=13, 17|url={{Google Books|id=wPBtAAAAMAAJ|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sauk people have a [[Great Lakes Algonquian syllabics|syllabic orthography]] for their language. They published a Primer Book in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Mary F. (1975). Sac and Fox Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma Primer Book Sac and Fox Language compiled and edited by Mary F. McCormick&lt;/ref&gt; based on a &quot;traditional&quot; syllabary that existed in 1906. It is intended to help modern-day Sauk to learn to write and speak their ancestral tongue. A newer orthography was proposed around 1994 to aid in language revival. The former syllabary was aimed at remaining native speakers of Sauk; the more recent orthography was developed for native English speakers, as many Sauk grow up with English as their first language (Reinschmidt 1994).

Sauk has so few speakers that it is considered an endangered language, as are numerous others native to North America.

In 2005, ''A Concise Dictionary of the Sauk Language'' was published using the Algonquianist Standard Roman Orthography.&lt;ref name=Whittaker&gt;{{cite book |last=Whittaker |first=Gordon |date=2005 |title=A Concise Dictionary of the Sauk Language|url=http://learn.bacone.edu/pluginfile.php/26452/mod_resource/content/1/sauk-concise-dictionary.pdf |location=Stroud, Oklahoma |publisher=The Sac &amp; Fox National Public Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical names==
[[Lake Osakis]] in west-central [[Minnesota]], the [[Sauk River (Minnesota)|Sauk River]],&lt;ref&gt;The name of the [[Sauk River (Washington)|Sauk River]] in Washington State, however, comes from the ''Sah-kee-ma-hu'' (Sauk-Suiattle tribe), a group related to the Skagit tribes, not from the Sac tribe of the Midwestern U.S. (James W. Phillips, ''Washington State Place Names'', University of Washington Press, September 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; which flows from Lake Osakis, and the towns of [[Osakis, MN|Osakis]], [[Sauk Centre, MN|Sauk Centre]], and [[Sauk Rapids, MN|Sauk Rapids]] all were named for association historically with a small party of Sac who made camp on the shores of Lake Osakis. They had been banished from their tribe for murder. According to [[Ojibwa|Anishinaabe]] oral tradition, these five Sac were killed by local [[Sioux|Dakota]] in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name = Upham&gt;{{cite book| last =Upham| first =Warren| authorlink =Warren Upham| title =Minnesota Place Names, A Geographical Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition| publisher =Minnesota Historical Society| year =2001| location =Saint Paul, Minnesota| page =53| isbn =0-87351-396-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cluedo''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|uː|d|oʊ}}), known as '''''Clue''''' in [[North America]], is a [[murder mystery game]] for three to six players that was devised in 1943 by [[Anthony E. Pratt]] from [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. The game was first manufactured by [[Waddingtons]] in the [[UK]] in 1949. Since then, it has been relaunched and updated several times, and it is currently owned and published by the American game and toy company [[Hasbro]].

The object of the game is to determine who murdered the game's victim, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used. Each player assumes the role of one of the six suspects and attempts to deduce the correct answer by strategically moving around a game board representing the rooms of a mansion and collecting clues about the circumstances of the murder from the other players.

Numerous games, books, [[Clue (film)|a film]], television series, and a musical have been released as part of the ''Cluedo'' franchise. Several spinoffs have been released featuring various extra characters, weapons and rooms, or different game play. The original game is marketed as the &quot;Classic Detective Game&quot;, and the various spinoffs are all distinguished by different slogans.

In 2008, ''[[Cluedo: Discover the Secrets]]'' was created (with changes to board, gameplay and characters) as a modern spinoff, but it was criticised in the media and by fans of the original game. ''Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game'' was then introduced in 2012, returning to Pratt's classic formula but also adding several variations.

==History==
In 1944, [[Anthony E. Pratt]], an English musician, applied for a [[patent]] of his invention of a murder/mystery-themed game, originally named &quot;Murder!&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Invention&quot;&gt;L. A. Petrosjan, V. V. Mazalov (2002). &quot;Game Theory and Applications, Volume 8&quot;. p. 26. Nova Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Pratt and his wife, Elva Pratt (1913–1990), who had helped in designing the game, presented it to [[Waddingtons]]' executive, Norman Watson, who immediately purchased it and provided its trademark name of &quot;Cluedo&quot; (a play on &quot;clue&quot; and &quot;[[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]]&quot;; ''ludo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''I play'', and a common British term for the game [[Parcheesi]]).

Although the patent was granted in 1947, due to [[WWII|postwar]] shortages in the UK the game was not officially launched by Waddingtons until 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Invention&quot;/&gt; It was simultaneously licensed to [[Parker Brothers]] in the US for publication, where it was renamed &quot;Clue&quot; along with other minor changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Victor |last=Watson |year=2008 |title=The Waddingtons Story: From the early days to Monopoly, the Maxwell bids and into the next Millennium |location=Huddersfield |publisher=Jeremy Mills Publishing |isbn=978-1-906600-36-5 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_kmjwW4ZTMC&amp;pg=PA81 |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several differences between the original game concept and the one initially published in 1949. In particular, Pratt's original design calls for [[Cluedo characters#Characters in the English versions of the game|ten characters]], one of whom was to be designated the victim by random drawing prior to the start of the game. These ten included the eliminated Mr. Brown, Mr. Gold, Miss Grey, and Mrs. Silver. The characters of [[Cluedo characters#Mrs. White|Nurse White]] and [[Cluedo characters#Colonel Mustard|Colonel Yellow]] were renamed Mrs. White and Colonel Mustard for the actual release. The game allowed for play of up to eight remaining characters, providing for nine suspects in total. Originally there were eleven rooms, including the eliminated &quot;[[Gunroom|gun room]]&quot; and cellar. In addition there were nine weapons including the unused [[bomb]], [[syringe]], [[shillelagh (club)|shillelagh]] (walking stick/[[cudgel]]), [[fireplace poker]], and the later used [[axe]] and [[poison]]. Some of these unused weapons and characters appeared later in spin-off versions of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;timelesstoys&quot;/&gt;

Some gameplay aspects were different as well. Notably, the remaining playing cards were distributed into the rooms to be retrieved, rather than dealt directly to the players. Players also had to land on another player in order to make suggestions about that player's character through the use of special counter-tokens, and once exhausted, a player could no longer make suggestions. There were other minor differences, all of which were later updated by the game's initial release and remain essentially unchanged in the standard Classic Detective Game editions of the game.&lt;ref name=ATP&gt;{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Treneman |date=12 November 1998 |title=Mr Pratt, in the old people's home, with an empty pocket |work=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/mr-pratt-in-the-old-peoples-home-with-an-empty-pocket-1184258.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210122936/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/mr-pratt-in-the-old-peoples-home-with-an-empty-pocket-1184258.html |accessdate=July 13, 2015|archive-date=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/clue/default.cfm?page=History&amp;src=endeca |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929021146/http://www.hasbro.com/clue/default.cfm?page=History&amp;src=endeca |archive-date=September 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=GB |number=586817 |status=patent |title=Improvements in board games |gdate=April 1, 1947 |inventor=Pratt, Anthony Ernest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=20 December 2008 |title=Jack Mustard, in the spa, with a baseball bat |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/20/cluedo-new-rebrand-family |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methodology used in the early versions of Cluedo is remarkably similar to a traditional, if little known, American [[card game]], [[The King of Hearts Has Five Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DeductionGames.shtml &quot;The Secret of Winning at Cluedo&quot; in ''Deduction Games''] at www.thegamesjournal.com.

We'd play a stupid game called Murder, where guests crept up on each other in corridors and the victim would shriek and fall on the floor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mentalfloss.com/article/62111/how-one-british-soldier-turned-parlor-game-clue ''How One British Soldier Turned a Parlor Game into Clue'' by Mary Pilon at mentalfloss.com.

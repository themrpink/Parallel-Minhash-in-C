==Culture==
[[File:&quot;Ndaw rabine&quot; dans traditionnelle lebou.jpg|thumb|N'dawrabine dance of [[Ngor, Dakar|Ngor]]]]
In Senegal the traditional culture is very centred around the idea of family. This even includes the way that they eat. When it is time to eat a typical meal someone will say &quot;kay lekk&quot; which means 'come eat'. Everyone will come together and sit around the plate and eat with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.commisceo-global.com/country-guides/senegal-guide|title=Senegal - Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette|website=www.commisceo-global.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some famous dishes include Cebbu Jën (Tiéboudienne) and Yassa. The etiquette of people in Dakar is very simple but very vital. To not greet someone upon sight is to portray rudeness and oftentimes ignorance. Due to French colonialism the children of Dakar have a unique school system. The school will get a break at about midday and return home to get some rest. Since the population is majority Muslim there are daily activities such as going to the mosque at noon prayer and attending the mosque on Fridays. Music has a big influence on the youth with famous artists like Daara J Family who use their voice to represent the problems in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://musicinafrica.net/hip-hop-senegal?language=en|title=Hip-hop in Senegal|date=2015-02-06|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cape of Good Hope''' ({{lang-af|Kaap die Goeie Hoop}} {{IPA-af|ˌkɑːp di ˌχujə ˈɦuəp|}}; {{lang-nl|Kaap de Goede Hoop}} {{IPA-nl|ˌkaːb də ˌɣudə ˈɦoːp||Nl-Kaap de Goede Hoop.ogg}};{{efn|''Kaap'' in isolation: {{IPA-nl|kaːp||nl-kaap.ogg}}.}} {{lang-pt|Cabo da Boa Esperança}} {{IPA-pt|ˈkaβu ðɐ ˈβoɐ (ɨ)ʃpɨˈɾɐ̃sɐ|ˈkaβu ðɐ ˈβoɐ (ɨ)ʃpɨˈɾɐ̃sɐ}}) is a rocky headland on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of the [[Cape Peninsula]] in [[South Africa]].

A common misconception is that the Cape of Good Hope is the southern tip of [[Africa]]. This misconception was based on the misbelief that the Cape was the dividing point between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s. Contemporary geographic knowledge instead states the southernmost point of Africa is [[Cape Agulhas]] about {{convert|150|km|-1}} to the [[east-southeast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.airpano.com/360Degree-VirtualTour.php?3D=cape-good-hope-rsa|title=Cape of Good Hope, South Africa - 360° Aerial Panoramas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The currents of the two oceans meet at the point where the warm-water [[Agulhas current]] meets the cold-water [[Benguela current]] and turns back on itself. That oceanic meeting point fluctuates between Cape Agulhas and [[Cape Point]] (about {{convert|1.2|km}} east of the Cape of Good Hope).

When following the western side of the African coastline from the equator, however, the Cape of Good Hope marks the point where a ship begins to travel more eastward than southward. Thus, the first modern rounding of the cape in 1488 by [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese]] explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] was a milestone in the attempts by the Portuguese to establish direct trade relations with the [[Far East]] (although [[Herodotus]] mentioned a claim that the [[Phoenicia]]ns had done so [[Necho II#Phoenician expedition|far earlier]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodotus/hist01.htm The first circumnavigation of Africa]. livius.org&lt;/ref&gt; Dias called the cape ''Cabo das Tormentas'' (&quot;Cape of Storms&quot;; {{lang-nl|Stormkaap}}), which was the original name of the &quot;Cape of Good Hope&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Englishwoman In America|url=https://archive.org/details/englishwomaninam00maur|year=1848|author=Sarah Mytton Maury|page=[https://archive.org/details/englishwomaninam00maur/page/33 33]|authorlink=Sarah Mytton Maury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the [[great capes]] of the South Atlantic Ocean, the Cape of Good Hope has long been of special significance to sailors, many of whom refer to it simply as &quot;'''the Cape'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way'', Francis Chichester; page 78. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1966. {{ISBN|0-340-00191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[waypoint]] on the [[Cape Route]] and the [[clipper route]] followed by [[clipper ship]]s to the [[Far East]] and [[Australia]], and still followed by several offshore [[yacht racing|yacht races]].

The term ''Cape of Good Hope'' is also used in three other ways:

* It is a section of the [[Table Mountain National Park]], within which the cape of the same name, as well as Cape Point, falls. Prior to its incorporation into the national park, this section constituted the Cape Point Nature Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/tourism/map.php Map of the Park, showing the Cape of Good Hope section (retrieved 27 March 2010).]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was the name of the early [[Cape Colony]] established by the Dutch in 1652, on the Cape Peninsula.
* Just before the [[Union of South Africa]] was formed, the term referred to the entire region that in 1910 was to become the [[Cape of Good Hope Province]] (usually shortened to ''the Cape Province'').

== History ==

[[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|d|ə|k|s|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Εὔδοξος}}, ''Eúdoxos''; fl. c. 130 BC) was a [[ethnic Greek|Greek]] [[navigator]] for [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII]], king of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] in [[Egypt]], who found the wreck of a ship in the [[Indian Ocean]] that appeared to have come from [[Cádiz|Gades]] (today's [[Cádiz]] in Spain), rounding the Cape.

When Eudoxus was returning from his second voyage to India, the wind forced him south of the [[Gulf of Aden]] and down the coast of Africa for some distance. Somewhere along the coast of East Africa, he found the remains of the ship. Due to its appearance and the story told by the natives, Eudoxus concluded that the ship was from Gades and had sailed anti-clockwise around Africa, passing the Cape and entering the Indian Ocean. This inspired him to repeat the voyage and attempt a [[circumnavigation]] of the continent. Organising the expedition on his own account he set sail from Gades and began to work down the African coast. The difficulties were too great, however, and he was obliged to return to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tozer |first= Henry F. |title= ''History of Ancient Geography'' |year= 1997 |publisher= Biblo &amp; Tannen |isbn= 0-8196-0138-1 |pages= 189–190}}; online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=svsNTIU3EskC Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

After this failure he again set out to circumnavigate Africa. His eventual fate is unknown. Although some, such as [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], claimed that Eudoxus did achieve his goal, the most probable conclusion is that he perished on the journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tozer |first= Henry F. |title= History of Ancient Geography |year= 1997 |publisher= Biblo &amp; Tannen |isbn= 0-8196-0138-1 |pages= xxiii}}; online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=svsNTIU3EskC Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1450 [[Fra Mauro map]], the Indian Ocean is depicted as connected to the Atlantic. Fra Mauro puts the following inscription by the southern tip of Africa, which he names the &quot;Cape of Diab&quot;, describing the exploration by a ship from the East around 1420:&lt;ref name=&quot;Marco Polo&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marco Polo|p=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Needham&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1971|p=501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FraMauroChineseShip.jpg|thumb|Detail of the Fra Mauro Map describing the construction of the junks that navigate in the Indian Ocean.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Around 1420 a ship, or junk, from India crossed the Sea of India  towards the Island of Men and the Island of Women, off Cape Diab, between the Green Islands and the shadows. It sailed for 40 days in a south-westerly direction  without ever finding anything other than wind and water. According to these people themselves, the ship  went some 2,000 miles ahead until – once favourable conditions came to an end – it turned round and sailed back to Cape Diab in 70 days.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ships called junks (lit. &quot;Zonchi&quot;) that navigate these seas carry four masts or more, some of which can be raised or lowered, and have 40 to 60 cabins for the merchants and only one tiller. They can navigate without a [[compass]], because they have an [[astrologer]], who stands on the side and, with an [[astrolabe]] in hand, gives orders to the navigator. (Text from the Fra Mauro map, 09-P25.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fra Mauro explained that he obtained the information from &quot;a trustworthy source&quot;, who traveled with the expedition, possibly the Venetian explorer [[Niccolò da Conti]] who happened to be in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[India]] at the time the expedition left:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is more, I have spoken  with a person worthy of trust, who says that he sailed in an Indian ship caught in the fury of a tempest for 40 days out in the Sea of India, beyond the [[Sofala|Cape of Soffala]] and the Green Islands towards west-southwest; and according to the astrologers who act as their guides, they had advanced almost 2,000 miles. Thus one can believe and confirm what is said by both these and those, and that they had therefore sailed 4,000 miles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fra Mauro also comments that the account of the expedition, together with the relation by [[Strabo]] of the travels of [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] to [[Gibraltar]] through the southern Ocean in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], led him to believe that the [[Indian Ocean]] was not a closed sea and that [[Africa]] could be circumnavigated by her southern end (Text from Fra Mauro map, 11, G2). This knowledge, together with the map depiction of the African continent, probably encouraged the Portuguese to intensify their effort to round the tip of Africa.

In the [[Early Modern Era]], the first European to reach the cape was the Portuguese explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] on 12 March 1488, who named it the &quot;Cape of Storms&quot; (''Cabo das Tormentas''). It was later renamed by [[John II of Portugal]] as &quot;Cape of Good Hope&quot; (''Cabo da Boa Esperança'') because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to [[India]] and the East.

The [[Khoikhoi]] people lived in the cape area when the Dutch first settled there in 1652. The Khoikhoi had arrived in this area about fifteen hundred years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehret|first1=Christopher|title=An African Classical Age|date=2001|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville, VA|isbn=0-8139-2057-4|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch called them [[Khoikhoi|Hottentot]]s, a term that has now come to be regarded as pejorative.

[[Dutch people|Dutch]] colonial administrator [[Jan van Riebeeck]] established a resupply camp for the [[Dutch East India Company]] some 50&amp;nbsp;km north of the cape in [[Table Bay]] on 6 April 1652 and this eventually developed into [[Cape Town]]. Supplies of fresh food were vital on the long journey around Africa and Cape Town became known as &quot;The Tavern of the Seas&quot;.

On 31 December 1687 a community of [[Huguenots]] (French Protestants) arrived at the Cape of Good Hope from the Netherlands. They had escaped from France and fled to the Netherlands to flee religious persecution in France. One example was Pierre Joubert who came from [[La Motte-d'Aigues]]. The Dutch East India Company needed skilled farmers at the Cape of Good Hope and the Dutch Government saw opportunities to settle Huguenots at the Cape and sent them there. The Cape colony gradually grew over the next 150 years or so until it stretched for hundreds of kilometres to the north and north-east.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Dutch Republic was occupied by the French in 1795. Thus the Cape Colony became a French vassal and enemy of the British. Therefore, the United Kingdom invaded and occupied the Cape Colony that same year. The British relinquished control of the territory in 1803 but returned and reoccupied the Colony on 19 January 1806 following the [[Battle of Blaauwberg]]. The Dutch ceded the territory to the British in the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]] The Cape was then administered as the [[Cape Colony]] and it remained a British colony until it was incorporated into the independent [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 (now known as the Republic of South Africa).

The Portuguese government erected two navigational beacons, '''Dias Cross''' and '''da Gama Cross''', to commemorate [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] as explorers who as mentioned were the first explorers to reach the cape. When lined up, the crosses point to Whittle Rock, a large, permanently submerged shipping hazard in [[False Bay]]. Two other beacons in [[Simon's Town]] provide the intersection.

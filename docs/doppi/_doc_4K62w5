A [[requiem]] mass was held on May 18 at the Church of the Good Shepherd, attended by many of Cooper's friends, including [[James Stewart]], [[Henry Hathaway]], [[Joel McCrea]], [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Jack L.

== Acting style and reputation ==
{{Quote|quote=Naturalness is hard to talk about, but I guess it boils down to this: You find out what people expect of your type of character and then you give them what they want. That way, an actor never seems unnatural or affected no matter what role he plays.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; |source=Gary Cooper}}

Cooper's acting style consisted of three essential characteristics: his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen. Acting teacher [[Lee Strasberg]] once observed: &quot;The simplest examples of [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavsky]]'s ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and [[Spencer Tracy]]. They try not to act but to be themselves, to respond or react. They refuse to say or do anything they feel not to be consonant with their own characters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-156&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Film director [[François Truffaut]] ranked Cooper among &quot;the greatest actors&quot; because of his ability to deliver great performances &quot;without direction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-156&quot; /&gt; This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced that he was simply &quot;playing himself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaminsky-2&quot; /&gt;

Cooper's ability to project his personality onto his characters played an important part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor [[John Barrymore]] said of Cooper, &quot;This fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learn—namely, to be natural.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-89&quot; /&gt; [[Charles Laughton]], who played opposite Cooper in ''Devil and the Deep'' agreed, &quot;In truth, that boy hasn't the least idea how well he acts ... He gets at it from the inside, from his own clear way of looking at life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-89&quot; /&gt; William Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a &quot;superb actor, a master of movie acting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of Cooper's performance in ''The Real Glory'', [[Graham Greene]] wrote, &quot;Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-89&quot; /&gt;

Cooper's style of underplaying before the camera surprised many of his directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky 1979, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on Cooper's performance in ''Sergeant York'', director Howard Hawks observed, &quot;He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't going to be any good. But when you saw the [[dailies|rushes]] in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-153&quot; /&gt; Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in ''Pride of the Yankees'', noting, &quot;What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow actors admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, &quot;The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-179&quot; /&gt;

[[Tom Hanks]] declared, &quot;In only one scene in the first film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, we see the future of screen acting in the form of Gary Cooper. He is quiet and natural, somehow different from the other cast members. He does something mysterious with his eyes and shoulders that is much more like 'being' than 'acting'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thomson |first1=David |title=Why Goldwyn Wore Jodhpurs |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n12/david-thomson/why-goldwyn-wore-jodhpurs |website=London Review of Books |pages=22–23 |date=22 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Day-Lewis]] said, &quot;I don't particularly like westerns as a genre, but I do love certain westerns. 'High Noon' means a lot to me – I love the purity and the honesty, I love Gary Cooper in that film, the idea of the last man standing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daniel Day-Lewis's All-Time Top Westerns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11daylewislist.html?mtrref=en.wikipedia.org&amp;gwh=B823D5F803DBE98DBC496BFA35919015&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=REGIWALL |website=The New York Times |date=10 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Pratt]] stated, &quot;I started watching Westerns when I was shooting in London about four or five years ago. I really fell in love with Gary Cooper, and his stuff. That sucked me into the Westerns. Before, I never got engrossed in the story. I'd just dip in, and there were guys in horses in black and white. High Noon's later Gary Cooper, I liked that. But I liked 'The Westerner'. That's my favorite one. I have that poster hung up in my house because I really like that one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='The Magnificent Seven': Chris Pratt, Denzel Washington share favorite Westerns |url=https://ew.com/article/2016/08/11/magnificent-seven-chris-pratt-denzel-washington/ |website=EW.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To [[Al Pacino]], &quot;Gary Cooper was a phenomenon—his ability to take some thing and elevate it, give it such dignity. One of the great presences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AL PACINO: THE PLAYBOY INTERVIEW (1979) |url=https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/2018/02/16/al-pacino-playboy-interview-1979/ |website=Scraps from the loft |date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career assessment and legacy ==
[[File:Los Angeles (California, USA), Hollywood Boulevard, Gary Cooper -- 2012 -- 4981.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Photo of Gary Cooper's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame|Cooper's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame]]
Cooper's career spanned thirty-six years, from 1925 to 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-2&quot;&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, he appeared in eighty-four feature films in a leading role.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky 1979, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a major movie star from the end of the [[silent film]] era to the end of the golden age of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classical Hollywood]]. His natural and authentic acting style appealed powerfully to both men and women,&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres, including Westerns, war films, adventure films, drama films, crime films, romance films, comedy films, and romantic comedy films. He appeared on the ''Motion Picture Herald'' exhibitor's poll of top ten film personalities for twenty-three consecutive years, from 1936 to 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-147&quot; /&gt; According to Quigley's annual poll, Cooper was one of the top money-making stars for eighteen years, appearing in the top ten in 1936–37, 1941–49, and 1951–57.&lt;ref name=&quot;quigley&quot; /&gt; He topped the list in 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;quigley&quot; /&gt; In Quigley's list of all-time money-making stars, Cooper is listed fourth, after John Wayne, [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Tom Cruise]].&lt;ref name=&quot;quigley&quot; /&gt; At the time of his death, it was estimated that his films grossed well over $200 million&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-2&quot; /&gt; (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.2|1961|r=2}} billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}).

In over half of his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, pilots, sailors, and explorers—all men of action.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaminsky-2&quot;&gt;Kaminsky 1979, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the rest he played a wide range of characters, included doctors, professors, artists, architects, clerks, and baseball players.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaminsky-2&quot; /&gt; Cooper's heroic screen image changed with each period of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaminsky-219&quot;&gt;Kaminsky 1979, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; In his early films, he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues (''The Virginian'').&lt;ref name=&quot;kaminsky-219&quot; /&gt; After becoming a major star, his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas (''A Farewell to Arms'').&lt;ref name=&quot;kaminsky-219&quot; /&gt; During the height of his career, from 1936–43, he played a new type of hero—a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others (''Mr. Deeds'', ''Meet John Doe'', and ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'').&lt;ref name=&quot;kaminsky-219&quot; /&gt;

In the post-war years, Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone (''The Fountainhead'' and ''High Noon'').&lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky 1979, pp. 219–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In his final films, Cooper's hero rejects the violence of the past, and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption (''Friendly Persuasion'' and ''Man of the West'').&lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky 1979, pp. 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero—a tall, handsome, and sincere man of steadfast integrity&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; who emphasized action over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, the adventurer, and the common man.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 1960, Cooper was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6243 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to the film industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;walk-of-fame&quot; /&gt; He was awarded a star on the sidewalk outside the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Montana.&lt;ref name=&quot;ricker&quot; /&gt;

On May 6, 1961, he was awarded the French [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Order of Arts and Letters]] in recognition of his significant contribution to the arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-308&quot; /&gt; On July 30, 1961, he was posthumously awarded the [[David di Donatello]] Special Award in Italy for his career achievements.&lt;ref name=&quot;david&quot; /&gt;

In 1966, he was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] at the [[National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum]] in Oklahoma City.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncm&quot; /&gt; In 2015, he was inducted into the Utah Cowboy and Western Heritage Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame Inductees – Gary Cooper|url=http://utahcowboymuseum.org/nominations/hall-of-fame-inductees/|website=Utah Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum|accessdate=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) ranked Cooper eleventh on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|25 male stars of classic Hollywood]].&lt;ref name=&quot;afi-stars&quot; /&gt; Three of his characters—Will Kane, Lou Gehrig, and Sergeant York—made AFI's list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains|one hundred greatest heroes and villains]], all of them as heroes.&lt;ref name=&quot;afi-heroes&quot; /&gt; His Lou Gehrig line, &quot;Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.&quot;, is ranked by AFI as the thirty-eighth [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|greatest movie quote of all time]].&lt;ref name=&quot;afi-quotes&quot; /&gt;

More than a half century after his death, Cooper's enduring legacy, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, is his image of the ideal American hero preserved in his film performances.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 323–324.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlton Heston]] once observed, &quot;He projected the kind of man Americans would like to be, probably more than any actor that's ever lived.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky 1979, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the TV series ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]'', based on works and characters created by [[Elmore Leonard]], Gary Cooper is used throughout the six seasons as the man whom U.S. Marshall [[Raylan Givens]], played by [[Timothy Olyphant]], aspires to be. When his colleague asks Marshall Givens how he thinks his dangerous plan to bring down a villain can possibly work, he replies: &quot;Why not? Worked for Gary Cooper.&quot;

Gary Cooper is referenced several times in the critically acclaimed television series ''[[The Sopranos]]'', with protagonist [[Tony Soprano]] asking &quot;What ever happened to Gary Cooper? The strong, silent type.&quot; while complaining about his problems to his therapist.

In the 1930s hit song &quot;[[Putting on the Ritz]]&quot;, Cooper is referenced in the line &quot;dress up like a million dollar trooper/Tryin' hard to look like Gary Cooper, Super duper!&quot; More than two decades after Cooper's death a new version of the song was released in 1983 by [[Taco (musician)|Taco]]; the original lyrics were kept, including the references to Cooper.

In [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', Cooper is &quot;spotted&quot; by [[Holden Caulfield]] to distract a woman he is dancing with.

      <text bytes="5849" xml:space="preserve">A '''remotely guided rat,''' popularly called a '''ratbot''' or '''robo-rat''', is a [[rat]] with electrodes implanted in the [[medial forebrain bundle]] (MFB) and [[sensorimotor cortex]] of its brain. They were developed in 2002 by Sanjiv Talwar and John Chapin at the [[SUNY Downstate Medical Center|State University of New York Downstate Medical Center]].  The rats wear a small electronics backpack containing a [[radio receiver]] and electrical stimulator.  The rat receives remote stimulation in the sensorimotor cortex via its backpack that causes the rat to feel a sensation in its left or right [[vibrissae|whiskers]], and stimulation in the MFB that is interpreted as a [[Reward system|reward]] or pleasure.

After a period of training and [[physical exercise|conditioning]] using MFB stimulation as a reward, the rats can be remotely directed to move left, right, and forward in response to whisker stimulation signals. It is possible to roughly guide the animal along an obstacle course, jumping small gaps and scaling obstacles.

==Applications==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Currently, robo-rats are primarily being trained to detect [[explosives]] in areas where humans and existing robots cannot efficiently search, such as crowds and cargo ships. Other possible uses of the robo-rat include [[search and rescue]] operations following a natural disaster, military reconnaissance and landmine detection.  A camera, transmitter, and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver that mount on rat backpacks have been designed to facilitate these purposes.  However, it has been suggested that by interpreting biological signals directly from the brain of the rat, additional information could be obtained without the use of external equipment.  This could be used, for example, to detect chemical and biological [[toxins]] in the air via the rat's own sense of smell.

Additionally, these rats have further applications in pure science.  It serves as a new experimental model for behavioral studies in [[psychology]].  MFB stimulation is a valuable tool in behavioral research, but traditional research using MFB stimulation has required that test animals be confined within an experimental chamber.  This difficulty is avoided because the robo-rat can be guided wirelessly.

Principal funding for the development of the robo-rat has come from [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]].

==Ethics==
Concerns have been raised by animal rights groups about the use of animals in this context, particularly due to a concern about the removal of autonomy from an independent creature. For example, a spokesman of the [[Dr Hadwen Trust]], a group funding alternatives to animal research in medicine, has said that the experiments are an &quot;appalling example of how the human species instrumentalizes other species.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitehouse |first=David |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1961798.stm |title=Here come the ratbots |work=BBC News |date=2002-06-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509040138/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1961798.stm |archivedate=2019-05-09 |accessdate=2019-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers tend to liken the training mechanism of the robo-rat to standard [[operant conditioning]] techniques. Talwar himself has acknowledged the ethical issues apparent in the development of the robo-rat, but points out that the research meets standards for animal treatment laid down by the [[National Institute of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Graham-Rowe |first=Duncan |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2237-robo-rat-controlled-by-brain-electrodes/ |title=&quot;Robo-rat&quot; controlled by brain electrodes |work=New Scientist |date=2002-04-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616001135/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2237-robo-rat-controlled-by-brain-electrodes/ |archivedate=2019-06-16 |accessdate=2019-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the researchers emphasize that the animals are trained, not coerced, into particular behaviors. Because the rats are encouraged to act via the reward of pleasure, not muscularly compelled to behave in a particular manner, their behavior under MFB stimulation is likened to a carrot-and-stick model of encouraged behavior versus a system of [[mind control]]. It seems unlikely that the rats could be persuaded to knowingly risk their lives even with this stimulation. &quot;Our animals were completely happy and treated well,&quot; Talwar stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1961798.stm|title=Here come the ratbots|date=May 1, 2002|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology is reminiscent of experiments performed in 1965 by [[José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado|Dr Jose Delgado]], a controversial scientist who was able to pacify a charging bull via electrodes fitted in its brain.  He was also said to control cats and monkeys like &quot;electronic toys.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wireheading.com/matador.html|title=Dr José Delgado and the electrically stimulated bull|website=www.wireheading.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor [[Robert Galbraith Heath]] also placed electrodes deep into the brains of patients and wrote hundreds of medical papers on his work.

'''Francesco Foscari''' (19 June 1373 – 1 November 1457) was the 65th [[Doges of Venice|Doge]] of the [[Republic of Venice]] from 1423 to 1457. His reign, the longest of all Doges in Venetian history, lasted 34 years, 6 months and 8 days, and coincided with the inception of the [[Italian Renaissance]].{{cn|date=December 2018}}

==Biography==
[[file:Frari (Venice) - Tomb of doge Francesco Foscari.jpg|thumb|His grave.]]
[[File:Antonio Gambello, Francesco Foscari, c. 1374-1457, Doge of Venice 1423 (obverse), probably c. 1457, NGA 44558.jpg|thumb|left|Antonio Gambello, 
''Francesco Foscari, c. 1374-1457, Doge of Venice 1423 (obverse)'', probably c. 1457]]
Francesco Foscari was born in 1373, as the oldest son of [[Nicolò Foscari (died 1412)|Nicolò Foscari]] and his wife Cateruzia Michiel.{{sfn|Romano|2007|p=3}} The [[Foscari]] family had been of only moderate importance, but had managed to become one of the few noble families that secured a hereditary place in the [[Great Council of Venice]] after the so-called ''[[Serrata del Maggior Consiglio|Serrata]]'' (&quot;Closing&quot;) of the Great Council, and had begun to rise in prominence throughout the 14th century. Francesco's ancestors began holding high public office, and his father Nicolò even became a member of the powerful [[Council of Ten]].{{sfn|Romano|2007|pp=3–5}}

Francesco served the [[Republic of Venice]] in numerous official capacities—as ambassador, president of the [[Council of Forty]], member of the [[Council of Ten]], inquisitor, [[Procurator of St Mark's]],&lt;ref&gt;The posts of ''procuratori di San Marco'' appointed by the ''Maggior Consiglio'', were , beneath the Doge, the most prestigious administrative posts of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]]; the offices of the procuratori, the ''[[Procuratie]]'' are the long low buildings that enfold [[Piazza San Marco]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Avogadoria de Comùn|avogador de comùn]]''— before he was elected in 1423&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In proclaiming the new doge the customary formula which recognized the people's share in the appointment and asked for their approval – the last vestige of popular government – was finally dropped.&quot; (''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911.)&lt;/ref&gt; defeating the other candidate, [[Pietro Loredan]]. His task as doge was to lead Venice in a long and protracted series of wars against [[duchy of Milan|Milan]], governed by the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]], who were attempting to dominate all of [[northern Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Wars in Lombardy]].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the justification of Venetian embroilment in the [[Domini di Terraferma|terraferma]] that was offered in Foscari's funeral oration, delivered by the humanist senator and historian [[Bernardo Giustiniani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. E. |last=Law |title=The Venetian Mainland State in the Fifteenth Century |journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society |series=Sixth Series |volume=2 |year=1992 |pages=153–174 [p. 157f] |doi=10.2307/3679103 }}; &quot;empire&quot; occurred in the tomb's inscription, though it was never officially employed (p. 163).&lt;/ref&gt; and some victories, the war was extremely costly to Venice, whose real source of wealth and power was at sea.  Venice, which during Foscari's leadership abandoned her ally [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], was eventually overcome by the forces of Milan under the leadership of [[Francesco Sforza]]. Sforza soon made peace with Florence, however, leaving Venice alone.

[[Image:Doge Francesco Foscari.png|thumb|left|120px|Coat of arms of Francesco Foscari.]]
Foscari was married twice: first to Maria Priuli, and then in 1415 to [[Marina Nani]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dogaressasofveni00stal#page/316/mode/2up  Edgcumbe Staley, ''The Dogaressas of Venice: The Wives of the Doges'' (London: T. Werner Laurie).]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1445, his only surviving son, Jacopo, was tried by the [[Council of Ten]] on charges of bribery and corruption and exiled from the city. Two further trials, in 1450 and 1456 - during the latter he confessed to, without even the need of torture, of having pleaded for help the [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] and the aforementioned Duke of Milan, both Venice's enemies - led to Jacopo's imprisonment on [[Crete]] and his eventual death there soon after.&lt;ref&gt;A. Zorzi ''La Repubblica del Leone'' (&quot;The Lion's Republic&quot;), p. 237, Bompiani Edizioni, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

News of Jacopo's death caused Foscari to withdraw from his government duties, and in October 1457 the Council of Ten forced him to abdicate. However, his death a week later provoked such public outcry that he was given a state funeral.

Beside his profile portrait by [[Lazzaro Bastiani]], Foscari commissioned a bas-relief bronze plaquette from [[Donatello]], which survives in several examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W. |last=Von Bode |title=Eine Porträtplakette des Dogen Francesco Foscari von Donatello: Ein Nachtrag |journal=[[Berliner Museen]] |volume=45 |issue=2 |year=1924 |pages=42–430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His figure kneeling in prayer to St Mark figured over the portal to the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] until it was dismantled by order of the revolutionary government, 1797; the head was preserved and is conserved in the Museo dell'Opera di Palazzo Ducale.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated and discussed by {{cite journal |first=Anne Markham |last=Schulz |title=The Sculpture of Giovanni and Bartolomeo Bon and Their Workshop |journal=[[Transactions of the American Philosophical Society]] |series=New Series |volume=68 |issue=3 |year=1978 |pages=1–81 [p. 47f and figs. 54, 55] |jstor=1006192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His monument by the sculptor [[Antonio Bregno]] in collaboration with his architect brother Paolo was erected in the church of [[Santa Maria dei Frari]] in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Giovanni |last=Mariacher |title=New Light on Antonio Bregno |journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=92 |issue=566 |year=1950 |pages=123–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and opera==
Foscari's life was the subject of a play ''[[The Two Foscari (Byron)|The Two Foscari]]'' by [[Lord Byron]] (1821) and an episode in [[Samuel Rogers]]' long poem ''Italy''. The Byron play served as the basis for the libretto written by [[Francesco Maria Piave]] for [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[I due Foscari]]'', which premiered on 3 November 1844 in [[Rome]]. [[Mary Mitford]], author of the popular literary sketches of the English countryside entitled ''[[Our Village]]'', also wrote a successful play concerned with events in Foscari's life. Mitford's play debuted at Covent Garden in 1826 with famed actor [[Charles Kemble]] in the lead.

The '''Battle of the Crater''' was a battle of the [[American Civil War]], part of the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. It took place on July 30, 1864, between the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]], commanded by [[General (CSA)|General]] [[Robert E. Lee]], and the [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Potomac]], commanded by [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George G. Meade]] (under the direct supervision of the general-in-chief, [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]).

After weeks of preparation, on July 30 Union forces exploded a mine in Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside|Ambrose E. Burnside]]'s [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]] sector, blowing a gap in the Confederate defenses of [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. From that propitious beginning, everything deteriorated rapidly for the Union attackers. Unit after unit charged into and around the crater, where soldiers milled in confusion. Grant considered the assault &quot;the saddest affair I have witnessed in this war.&quot;

The Confederates quickly recovered and launched several counterattacks led by Brig. Gen. [[William Mahone]]. The breach was sealed off, and Union forces were repulsed with severe casualties. [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Edward Ferrero]]'s division of black soldiers were badly mauled. It may have been Grant's best chance to end the Siege of Petersburg. Instead, the soldiers settled in for another eight months of trench warfare. Burnside was relieved of command for the last time for his role in the debacle, and he was never again returned to command.&lt;ref name=NPS&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/va070.htm NPS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909045347/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/va070.htm |date=September 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2017}}
During the Civil War, [[Petersburg, Virginia]], was an important railhead, and four railroad lines from the south met before they continued to [[Richmond, Virginia]], the capital of the Confederacy. Most supplies to Lee's army and Richmond funneled through there. Consequently, the Union regarded it as the &quot;back door&quot; to Richmond and as necessary for its defense.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. It was actually trench warfare, rather than a true [[siege]], as the armies were aligned along a series of fortified positions and trenches more than {{convert|20|mi|km}} long, extending from the old [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]] battlefield near Richmond to areas south of Petersburg.

After Lee stopped Grant's attempt to seize Petersburg on June 15, the battle settled into a stalemate. Grant had learned a hard lesson at Cold Harbor about attacking Lee in a fortified position and was chafing at the inactivity to which Lee's trenches and forts had confined him. Finally, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lt. Col.]] [[Henry Pleasants]], commanding the [[48th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment|48th Pennsylvania Infantry]] of Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose E. Burnside]]'s [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], offered a novel proposal to break the impasse.

Pleasants, a mining engineer from [[Pennsylvania]] in civilian life, proposed digging a long mine shaft under the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] lines and planting explosive charges directly underneath a fort (Elliott's Salient) in the middle of the Confederate First Corps line. If successful, not only would all the defenders in the area be killed, but also a hole in the Confederate defenses would be opened. If enough [[Union Army|Union]] troops filled the breach quickly enough and drove into the Confederate rear area, the Confederates would not be able to muster enough force to drive them out, and Petersburg might fall.

Burnside, whose reputation had suffered from his 1862 defeat at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] and his poor performance earlier that year at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]], agreed to Pleasants's plan.

===Mine construction===
[[File:Petersburg crater sketch LOC.jpg|thumb|Contemporary sketch of Col. Pleasants supervising the placement of powder in the mine]]
[[File:NPS marker deicting details of the mine.jpg|thumb|National Park Service marker depicting details of the mine]]
Digging began in late June, but even Grant and Meade saw the operation as a &quot;mere way to keep the men occupied&quot; and doubted it of any actual tactical value. They quickly lost interest, and Pleasants soon found himself with few materials for his project, and his men even had to forage for wood to support the structure.

Work progressed steadily, however. Earth was removed by hand and packed into improvised sledges made from cracker boxes fitted with handles, and the floor, wall, and ceiling of the mine were shored up with timbers from an abandoned wood mill and even from tearing down an old bridge.

The shaft was elevated as it moved toward the Confederate lines to make sure moisture did not clog up the mine, and fresh air was drawn in by an ingenious air-exchange mechanism near the entrance. A canvas partition isolated the miners' air supply from outside air and allowed miners to enter and exit the work area easily. The miners had constructed a vertical exhaust shaft located well behind Union lines. At the vertical shaft's base, a fire was kept continuously burning. A wooden duct ran the entire length of the tunnel and protruded into the outside air. The fire heated stale air inside of the tunnel, drawing it up the exhaust shaft and out of the mine by the [[stack effect|chimney effect]]. The resulting vacuum then sucked fresh air in from the mine entrance via the wooden duct, which carried it down the length of the tunnel to the place in which the miners were working.&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; That avoided the need for additional ventilation shafts, which could have been observed by the enemy, and it also easily disguised the diggers' progress.

On July 17, the main shaft reached under the Confederate position. Rumors of a mine construction soon reached the Confederates, but Lee refused to believe or act upon them for two weeks before he commenced countermining attempts, which were sluggish and uncoordinated, and were unable to discover the mine. However, General [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram]], whose batteries would be above the explosion, took the threat seriously enough to build a new line of trenches and artillery points behind his position as a precaution.

The mine was in a &quot;T&quot;-shape. The approach shaft was {{convert|511|ft|m}} long, starting in a sunken area downhill and more than {{convert|50|ft|m}} below the Confederate battery, making detection difficult. The tunnel entrance was narrow, about {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} wide and {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} high. At its end, a perpendicular gallery of {{convert|75|ft|m}} extended in both directions. Grant and Meade suddenly decided to use the mine three days after it was completed after a failed attack known later as the [[First Battle of Deep Bottom]]. Union soldiers filled the mine with 320 kegs of gunpowder, totaling {{convert|8,000|lb|kg}}. The explosives were approximately {{convert|20|ft|m|sigfig=1}} under the Confederate works, and the T-gap was packed shut with {{convert|11|ft|m|0}} of earth in the side galleries. A further {{convert|32|ft|m|0}} of packed earth in the main gallery to prevent the explosion blasting out the mouth of the mine. On July 28, the powder charges were armed.

===Preparation===
Burnside had trained a division of [[United States Colored Troops]] (USCT) under Brig. Gen. [[Edward Ferrero]] to lead the assault. The division consisted of two brigades, one designated to go to the left of the crater and the other to the right. A regiment from both brigades was to leave the attack column and extend the breach by rushing perpendicular to the crater, and the remaining regiments were to rush through, seizing the Jerusalem Plank Road just {{convert|1600|ft|m}} beyond, followed by the churchyard and, if possible, Petersburg itself. Burnside's two other divisions, made up of white troops, would then move in, supporting Ferrero's flanks and race for Petersburg itself. Two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) behind the front lines, out of sight of the Confederates, the men of the USCT division were trained for two weeks on the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the careful planning and intensive training, on the day before the attack, Meade, who lacked confidence in the operation, ordered Burnside not to use the black troops in the lead assault. He claimed that if the attack failed, black soldiers would be killed needlessly, creating political repercussions in the North. Meade may have also ordered the change of plans because he lacked confidence in the black soldiers' abilities in combat.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 759.&lt;/ref&gt; Burnside protested to Grant, who sided with Meade. When volunteers were not forthcoming, Burnside selected a replacement white division by having the three commanders draw lots. Brig. Gen. [[James H. Ledlie]]'s 1st Division was selected, but he failed to brief the men on what was expected of them and was reported during the battle to be drunk, well behind the lines, and not providing leadership. (Ledlie would be dismissed for his actions during the battle.)

The plan called for the mine to be detonated between 3:30 and 3:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. on the morning of July 30. Pleasants lit the fuse accordingly, but as with the rest of the mine's provisions, they had been given poor-quality fuses, which his men were forced to splice themselves. After more and more time passed and no explosion occurred (the impending dawn creating a threat to the men at the staging points, who were in view of the Confederate lines), two volunteers from the 48th Regiment (Lt. Jacob Douty and Sgt. Harry Reese) crawled into the tunnel. After discovering the fuse had burned out at a splice, they spliced on a length of new fuse and relit it.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, at 4:44&amp;nbsp;a.m., the charges exploded in a massive shower of earth, men, and guns. A crater (still visible today) was created, {{convert|170|ft|m}} long, {{convert|100|to|120|ft|m}} wide, and at least {{convert|30|ft|m|sigfig=1}} deep.

The explosion immediately killed 278 Confederate soldiers of the 18th and 22nd South Carolina&lt;ref&gt;Slotkin p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; and the stunned Confederate troops did not direct any significant rifle or artillery fire at the enemy for at least 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;James, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ledlie's untrained division was not prepared for the explosion, and reports indicate they waited 10 minutes before leaving their own entrenchments. Footbridges were supposed to have been placed to allow them to cross their own trenches quickly. Because they were missing, however, the men had to climb into and out of their own trenches just to reach no-man's land.&lt;ref&gt;Catton, ''Stillness at Appomattox'', pp. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Once they had wandered to the crater, instead of moving around it, as the black troops had been trained, they thought that it would make an excellent rifle pit in which to take cover. They therefore moved down into the crater itself, wasting valuable time while the Confederates, under Brig. Gen. [[William Mahone]], gathered as many troops together as they could for a counterattack. In about an hour, they had formed up around the crater and began firing rifles and artillery down into it in what Mahone later described as a &quot;[[turkey shoot]].&quot;

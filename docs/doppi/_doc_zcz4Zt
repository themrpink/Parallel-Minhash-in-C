Many Welsh people were angered by the judge's scornful treatment of the Welsh language, by the decision to move the trial to London, and by the decision of University College, Swansea, to dismiss Lewis from his post before he had been found guilty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_593&quot;/&gt; [[Dafydd Glyn Jones]] wrote of the fire that it was &quot;the first time in five centuries that Wales struck back at England with a measure of violence... To the Welsh people, who had long ceased to believe that they had it in them, it was a profound shock.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_593&quot;/&gt;

However, despite the acclaim the events of ''{{lang|cy|Tân yn Llŷn}}'' generated, by 1938 Lewis's concept of ''{{lang|cy|perchentyaeth}}'' (&quot;home ownership&quot;) had been firmly rejected as ''not'' a fundamental tenet of the party. In 1939 Lewis resigned as ''{{lang|cy|Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru}}'' president, saying that Wales was not ready to accept the leadership of a Roman Catholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_593&quot;/&gt;

Lewis was the son and grandson of prominent [[Presbyterian Church of Wales|Welsh Calvinistic Methodist]] ministers. In 1932, he had converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].

==Second World War==
Lewis maintained a strict neutrality in his writings through his column ''{{lang|cy|Cwrs y Byd}}'' in ''{{lang|cy|Y Faner}}''. It was his attempt at an unbiased interpretation of the causes and events of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_599&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the party's initial position on the war, party members were free to choose for themselves their level of support for the war effort. ''{{lang|cy|Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru}}'' was officially neutral regarding involvement the [[Second World War]], which Lewis and other leaders considered a continuation of the [[First World War]]. Central to the neutrality policy was the idea that Wales, as a nation, had the right to decide independently on its attitude towards war,&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_598&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=598}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rejection of other nations to force Welshmen to serve in their armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_598&quot;/&gt; With this challenging and revolutionary policy Lewis hoped a significant number of Welshmen would refuse to join the [[British Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_599&quot;/&gt;

Lewis and other party members were attempting to strengthen loyalty to the Welsh nation &quot;over the loyalty to the British State&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_598&quot;/&gt; Lewis argued &quot;The only proof that the Welsh nation exists is that there are some who act as if it did exist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_599&quot;/&gt;

However, most party members who claimed [[conscientious objection]] status did so in the context of their moral and religious beliefs, rather than on political policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_599&quot;/&gt; Of these almost all were exempt from military service. About 24 party members made politics their sole grounds for exemption, of whom 12 received prison sentences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_599&quot;/&gt; For Lewis, those who objected proved that the assimilation of Wales was &quot;being withstood, even under the most extreme pressures&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_599&quot;/&gt;

==University of Wales by-election, 1943==
Prior to 1950, universities could elect and return representatives to the House of Commons. The University of Wales seat had become vacant when the constituency's [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament, [[Ernest Evans (politician)|Ernest Evans]], had been appointed a [[County Court (England and Wales)|county court]] judge in 1942. Lewis was selected to contest the seat for Plaid Cymru in the ensuing [[1943 University of Wales by-election]].

His opponent was former Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru Deputy Vice-President Dr [[William John Gruffydd]]. Gruffydd had been voicing doubts about Lewis's ideas since 1933,&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_610&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=610}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1943 he had left Plaid Cymru and joined the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. His other opponent, independent candidate [[Alun Talfan Davies]], was another former member of Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru who would later become Chairman of the [[Welsh Liberal Party]].

The &quot;brilliant but wayward&quot; Gruffydd was a favorite with Welsh-speaking intellectuals and drew 52.3% of the vote, to Lewis's 22.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_610&quot; /&gt;

The election effectively split the Welsh-speaking intelligentsia, and left Lewis embittered with politics, leading him to retreat from direct political involvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_611&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=611}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the experience proved invaluable for Plaid Cymru, as &quot;for the first time they were taken seriously as a political force.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_611&quot; /&gt; The by-election campaign led directly to &quot;considerable growth&quot; in the party's membership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_611&quot; /&gt;

==''{{lang|cy|Tynged yr Iaith}}'' and the 1961 census==

In 1962 Lewis gave a radio speech entitled ''{{lang|cy|[[Tynged yr iaith]]}}'' (&quot;The Fate of the Language&quot;) in which he predicted the extinction of the Welsh language unless action was taken. Lewis's intention was to motivate Plaid Cymru into more direct action promoting the language; however it led to the formation of ''[[Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg]]'' (''Welsh Language Society'') later that year at a Plaid Cymru summer school held in [[Pontardawe]] in [[Glamorgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morgan|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of ''{{lang|cy|Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg}}'' allowed Plaid Cymru to focus on electoral politics, while the Cymdeithas focused on promoting the language.

Lewis's radio speech was in response to the 1961 census, which showed a decrease in the percentage of Welsh speakers from 36% in 1931 to 26%, of the population of about 2.5 million.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1961.shtml BBCWales History extracted 12-03-07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609020947/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1961.shtml |date=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the census the counties of Meirionnydd (Merionethshire), Ynys Môn (Anglesey), Caerfyrddin (Carmarthenshire), and Caernarfon (Caernarvonshire) averaged a 75% proportion of Welsh speakers, with the most significant decreases in the counties of [[Glamorgan]], [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]], and [[Pembrokeshire|Pembroke]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1931.shtml BBCWales History extracted 12-03-07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609020655/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1931.shtml |date=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to calls for Welsh devolution, in 1964 the [[Labour government, 1964–1970|Labour Government]] established the [[Welsh Office]] ({{lang-cy|Swyddfa Gymreig}}) and [[Secretary of State for Wales]].

==Nobel nominee==
In 1970, Lewis was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. His literary works include plays, poetry, novels and essays. He wrote mostly in Welsh, but he also wrote some works in English. By the time of his death in 1985 some rated him as amongst the most celebrated of Welsh writers.

==Political criticisms==
Lewis's perceived &quot;elitist&quot; views, &quot;and a &quot;condescending attitude towards some aspects of the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]], radical and pacifist traditions of Wales&quot; drew criticism from fellow nationalists such as [[David James Davies|D.&amp;nbsp;J. Davies]], a leftist party member.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_591&quot;/&gt; Davies argued in favour of engaging English-speaking Welsh communities, and stressed the territorial integrity of Wales. Davies pointed towards [[Scandinavia]]n countries as a model to emulate, and was active in the economic implications of Welsh self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|pp=591–592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways it was D.&amp;nbsp;J. Davies's ideal of Welsh nationalism which was adopted after the Second World War, wrote John Davies. But it was Lewis's &quot;brilliance and charismatic appeal&quot; which was firmly associated with ''{{lang|cy|Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru}}'' in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_592&quot;/&gt;

In 1936, in the midst of the turmoil of ''{{lang|cy|Tân yn Llŷn}}'', Lewis praised [[Adolf Hitler]] when he said &quot;At once he fulfilled his promise — a promise which was greatly mocked by the London papers months before that — to completely abolish the financial strength of the Jews in the economic life of Germany.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo011205/halltext/11205h02.htm United Kingdom Parliament]: Debate on ''[[Government of Wales Act 1998]]''. Retrieved 31 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s other British politicians also made favourable comments about fascist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Canadine, p. 52{{full citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]], himself a former Plaid Cymru President, declared in a television documentary on Lewis that he was &quot;lousy as a politician, lousy as a writer, but a good Catholic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2001/08/05/plaid-founder-blasted-91466-11220176/ |title=Plaid founder blasted |date=26 March 2013 |accessdate=16 March 2016 |publisher=[[WalesOnline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary activity==
Lewis was above all a dramatist. His notable plays include ''{{lang|cy|Blodeuwedd}}'' (The woman of flowers) (1923–25, revised 1948), ''{{lang|cy|[[Buchedd Garmon]]}}'' (The life of [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]]) (radio play, 1936), ''{{lang|cy|[[Siwan (play)|Siwan]]}}'' (1956), ''{{lang|cy|Gymerwch chi sigarét?}}'' (Will you have a cigarette?) (1956), ''{{lang|cy|Brad}}'' (Treachery) (1958), ''Esther'' (1960), and ''{{lang|cy|Cymru fydd}}'' (Tomorrow's Wales) (1967). He also translated [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''{{lang|fr|[[En attendant Godot]]}}'' from French into Welsh. His plays drew on a wide range of material and covered a range of subject matter including [[Welsh mythology]] and history, as well as the Bible, although he also wrote plays set in contemporary Wales.

Lewis wrote the [[libretto]] for [[Arwel Hughes]]'s opera ''{{lang|cy|Serch yw'r doctor}}'' (Love’s the doctor), based on [[Molière]]'s ''{{lang|fr|[[L'Amour médecin]]}}'' (first performance 1960 by [[Welsh National Opera]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serch yw'r Doctor (Love's the Doctor)|url=http://operadata.stanford.edu/catalog/10114788|work=Opening Night! Opera &amp; Oratorio Premieres|publisher=Stanford University Library|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published two novels, ''[[Monica (Saunders Lewis)|Monica]]'' (1930) and ''{{lang|cy|Merch Gwern Hywel}}'' (The daughter of Gwern Hywel) (1964) and two collections of poems as well as numerous articles and essays in various newspapers, magazines and journals. These articles have been collected into volumes including: ''{{lang|cy|Canlyn Arthur}}'' (Following Arthur) (1938), ''{{lang|cy|Ysgrifau dydd Mercher}}'' (Wednesday essays) (1945), ''{{lang|cy|Meistri'r canrifoedd}}'' (Masters of the centuries) (1973), ''{{lang|cy|Meistri a'u crefft}}'' (Masters and their craft) (1981) and ''{{lang|cy|Ati ŵyr ifainc}}'' (Go to it, young men) (1986).

==Honorary doctorate and demand for Latin mass==
In March 1983, at the age of 89, Saunders Lewis was made an honorary Doctor of Letters of the University of Wales at a ceremony specially conducted at his home in [[Penarth]]. The [[Catholic Herald]], reporting the honour, noted that in the previous year Lewis had made a plea for Mass to be said in Latin in Wales rather than in the &quot;foreign language of English&quot;, which he pointed out was &quot;a later arrival&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Herald 4 March 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth within celestial sphere.gif|right|thumb|[[Earth's rotation|Earth rotating]] within a relatively small-radius [[geocentric model|geocentric]] '''celestial sphere'''. Shown here are stars (white), the [[ecliptic]] (red, the circumscription of the Sun's apparent annual track), and the lines of [[right ascension]] and circles of [[declination]] (cyan) of the [[equatorial coordinate system]].]]

In [[astronomy]] and [[navigation]], the '''celestial sphere''' is an [[abstraction|abstract]] [[sphere]] that has an arbitrarily large [[radius]] and is [[concentric objects|concentric]] to [[Earth]]. All objects in the [[sky]] can be conceived as being [[projective geometry|projected]] upon the inner surface of the celestial sphere, which may be [[geocentric model|centered on Earth]] or the observer. If centered on the observer, half of the sphere would resemble a [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemispherical]] [[projection screen|screen]] over the observing location.

The celestial sphere is a practical tool for [[spherical astronomy]], allowing [[astronomer]]s to [[celestial coordinate system|specify]] the [[apparent place|apparent positions]] of [[astronomical object|objects]] in the sky if their distances are unknown or irrelevant. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[celestial equator]] divides the celestial sphere into two halves: the [[northern celestial hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern celestial hemisphere]]s.

==Introduction==
[[File:Celestial Sphere, 18th century.jpg|thumb|Celestial Sphere, 18th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]

Because [[astronomical object]]s are at such remote distances, casual observation of the [[sky]] offers no information on their actual distances. All celestial objects seem [[equidistant|equally far away]], as if [[fixed stars|fixed]] onto the inside of a [[sphere]] with a large but unknown radius,&lt;ref&gt;

which [[diurnal motion|appears to rotate]] westward overhead; meanwhile, [[Earth]] underfoot seems to remain still. For purposes of [[spherical astronomy]], which is concerned only with the [[direction (geometry)|directions]] to celestial objects, it makes no difference if this is actually the case or if it is Earth that is [[Earth's rotation|rotating]] while the celestial sphere is stationary.

The celestial sphere can be considered to be [[infinity|infinite]] in [[radius]]. This means any [[point (geometry)|point]] within it, including that occupied by the observer, can be considered the [[centre (geometry)|center]]. It also means that all [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] [[line (geometry)|lines]], be they [[millimetre]]s apart or across the [[Solar System]] from each other, will seem to intersect the sphere at a single point, analogous to the [[vanishing point]] of [[perspective (graphical)|graphical perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;

(a &quot;vanishing circle&quot;).

Conversely, observers looking toward the same point on an infinite-radius celestial sphere will be looking along parallel lines, and observers looking toward the same great circle, along parallel planes. On an infinite-radius celestial sphere, all observers see the same things in the same direction.

For some objects, this is over-simplified. Objects which are relatively near to the observer (for instance, the [[Moon]]) will seem to change position against the distant celestial sphere if the observer moves far enough, say, from one side of planet [[Earth]] to the other. This effect, known as [[parallax]], can be represented as a small offset from a mean position. The celestial sphere can be considered to be centered at the [[geocentric model|Earth's center]], the [[heliocentrism|Sun's center]], or any other convenient location, and offsets from positions referred to these centers can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;

In this way, [[astronomer]]s can predict [[geocentric coordinates|geocentric]] or [[Heliocentrism#Modern use of geocentric and heliocentric|heliocentric]] positions of objects on the celestial sphere, without the need to calculate the individual [[geometry]] of any particular observer, and the utility of the celestial sphere is maintained. Individual observers can work out their own small offsets from the mean positions, if necessary. In many cases in astronomy, the offsets are insignificant.

The celestial sphere can thus be thought of as a kind of astronomical [[shorthand]], and is applied very frequently by astronomers. For instance, the ''[[Astronomical Almanac]]'' for 2010 lists the apparent geocentric position of the [[Moon]] on January 1 at 00:00:00.00 [[Terrestrial Time]], in [[equatorial coordinate system|equatorial coordinates]], as [[right ascension]] 6&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 57&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; 48.86&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;, [[declination]] +23° 30' 05.5&quot;. Implied in this position is that it is as projected onto the celestial sphere; any observer at any location looking in that direction would see the &quot;geocentric Moon&quot; in the same place against the stars. For many rough uses (e.g. calculating an approximate phase of the Moon), this position, as seen from the Earth's center, is adequate.

For applications requiring precision (e.g. calculating the shadow path of an [[eclipse]]), the ''Almanac'' gives formulae and methods for calculating the ''topocentric'' coordinates, that is, as seen from a particular place on the Earth's surface, based on the geocentric position.&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomical Almanac 2010'', sec. D&lt;/ref&gt; This greatly abbreviates the amount of detail necessary in such almanacs, as each observer can handle their own specific circumstances.

==Celestial coordinate systems==
These concepts are important for understanding [[celestial coordinate system]]s, frameworks for measuring the positions of [[astronomical object|objects in the sky]]. Certain reference lines and [[plane of reference|planes]] on [[Earth]], when projected onto the celestial sphere, form the bases of the reference systems. These include the Earth's [[equator]], [[Earth's rotation|axis]], and [[Earth's orbit|orbit]]. At their intersections with the celestial sphere, these form the [[celestial equator]], the north and south [[celestial pole]]s, and the [[ecliptic]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Newcomb (1906), p. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt; As the celestial sphere is considered arbitrary or infinite in radius, all observers see the celestial equator, celestial poles, and ecliptic at the same place against the [[fixed stars|background stars]].

From these bases, directions toward objects in the sky can be quantified by constructing celestial coordinate systems. Similar to geographic [[longitude]] and [[latitude]], the [[equatorial coordinate system]] specifies positions relative to the [[celestial equator]] and [[celestial pole]]s, using [[right ascension]] and [[declination]]. The [[ecliptic coordinate system]] specifies positions relative to the ecliptic (Earth's [[orbital plane|orbit]]), using [[ecliptic coordinate system#Spherical coordinates|ecliptic longitude and latitude]]. Besides the equatorial and ecliptic systems, some other celestial coordinate systems, like the [[galactic coordinate system]], are more appropriate for particular purposes.

The ancients assumed the literal truth of stars attached to a celestial sphere, revolving about the Earth in one day, and a fixed Earth.&lt;ref&gt;

A celestial sphere can also refer to a physical model of the celestial sphere or celestial globe.
Such globes map the constellations on the ''outside'' of a sphere, resulting in a mirror image of the constellations as seen from Earth. The oldest surviving example of such an artifact is the globe of the [[Farnese Atlas]] sculpture, a 2nd-century copy of an older ([[Hellenistic period]], ca. 120 BCE) work.

==Bodies other than Earth==

Observers on other worlds would, of course, see objects in that sky under much the same conditions – as if projected onto a dome. Coordinate systems based on the sky of that world could be constructed. These could be based on the equivalent &quot;ecliptic&quot;, poles and equator, although the reasons for building a system that way are as much historic as technical.

Galland's version provoked a spate of pseudo-Oriental imitations. At the same time, some French writers began to parody the style and concoct far-fetched stories in superficially Oriental settings. These [[tongue-in-cheek]] pastiches include [[Antoine Hamilton|Anthony Hamilton]]'s ''Les quatre Facardins'' (1730), [[Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon|Crébillon]]'s ''[[The Sofa: A Moral Tale|Le sopha]]'' (1742) and [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s ''[[The Indiscreet Jewels|Les bijoux indiscrets]]'' (1748). They often contained veiled allusions to contemporary French society. The most famous example is [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Zadig]]'' (1748), an attack on religious bigotry set against a vague pre-Islamic Middle Eastern background.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 238–41&lt;/ref&gt; The English versions of the &quot;Oriental Tale&quot; generally contained a heavy moralising element,&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; with the notable exception of [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s fantasy ''[[Vathek]]'' (1786), which had a decisive influence on the development of the [[Gothic novel]]. The Polish nobleman [[Jan Potocki]]'s novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa|Saragossa Manuscript]]'' (begun 1797) owes a deep debt to the ''Nights'' with its Oriental flavour and labyrinthine series of embedded tales.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 245–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was included on a price-list of books on theology, history, and cartography, which was sent by the Scottish bookseller [[Andrew Millar]] (then an apprentice) to a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister. This is illustrative of the title's widespread popularity and availability in the 1720s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/6.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from Andrew Millar to Robert Wodrow, 5 August, 1725.

==== 1800s–1900s ====
The ''Nights'' continued to be a favourite book of many British authors of the Romantic and Victorian eras. According to [[A. S. Byatt]], &quot;In British Romantic poetry the Arabian Nights stood for the wonderful against the mundane, the imaginative against the prosaically and reductively rational.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt ''On Histories and Stories'' (Harvard University Press, 2001) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In their autobiographical writings, both [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Thomas de Quincey|de Quincey]] refer to nightmares the book had caused them when young. [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] also wrote about their childhood reading of the tales in their poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth in Book Five of ''[[The Prelude]]''; Tennyson in his poem &quot;Recollections of the ''Arabian Nights''&quot;. (Irwin, pp. 266–69)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Dickens]] was another enthusiast and the atmosphere of the ''Nights'' pervades the opening of his last novel ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1870).&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers have attempted to add a thousand and second tale,&lt;ref name=&quot;Byatt p.168&quot;&gt;Byatt p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Théophile Gautier]] (''La mille deuxième nuit'', 1842)&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopaedia Iranica&quot;/&gt; and [[Joseph Roth]] (''Die Geschichte von der 1002 Nacht'', 1939).&lt;ref name=&quot;Byatt p.168&quot;/&gt; [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote &quot;[[The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade]]&quot; (1845), a short story depicting the eighth and final voyage of [[Sinbad the Sailor]], along with the various mysteries Sinbad and his crew encounter; the anomalies are then described as footnotes to the story. While the king is uncertain—except in the case of the elephants carrying the world on the back of the turtle—that these mysteries are real, they are actual modern events that occurred in various places during, or before, Poe's lifetime. The story ends with the king in such disgust at the tale Scheherazade has just woven, that he has her executed the very next day.

Another important literary figure, the [[Ireland|Irish]] poet [[W. B. Yeats]] was also fascinated by the Arabian Nights, when he wrote in his prose book, [[A Vision]] an autobiographical poem, titled The Gift of [[Harun Al-Rashid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/exhibition/readingeurope/content/ire/NatLibIre_01.pdf|title=The Cat and the Moon and Certain Poems by William Butler Yeats}}&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to his joint experiments with his wife [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]], with [[Automatic writing]]. The automatic writing, is a technique used by many occultists in order to discern messages from the subconscious mind or from other spiritual beings, when the hand moves a pencil or a pen, writing only on a simple sheet of paper and when the person's eyes are shut. Also, the gifted and talented wife, is playing in Yeats's poem as &quot;a gift&quot; herself, given only allegedly by the caliph to the Christian and Byzantine philosopher [[Qusta ibn Luqa|Qusta Ibn Luqa]], who acts in the poem as a personification of W. B. Yeats. In July 1934 he was asked by Louis Lambert, while in a tour in the United States, which six books satisfied him most. The list that he gave placed the Arabian Nights, secondary only to William Shakespeare's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5GuCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Yeats+ethel+mannin+arabian+nights&amp;pg=PA291|title=In Excited Reverie: Centenary Tribute to W.B.

Stories from the ''One Thousand and One Nights'' have been popular subjects for films, beginning with [[Georges Méliès]]' ''[[The Palace of the Arabian Nights |Le Palais des Mille et une nuits]]'' (1905).

The critic Robert Irwin singles out the two versions of ''The Thief of Baghdad'' ([[The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)|1924 version]] directed by Raoul Walsh; [[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|1940 version]] produced by Alexander Korda)  and [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s ''[[Arabian Nights (1974 film)|Il fiore delle Mille e una notte]]'' (1974) as ranking &quot;high among the masterpieces of world cinema.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, pp. 291–92&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael James Lundell calls ''Il fiore'' &quot;the most faithful adaptation, in its emphasis on sexuality, of ''The 1001 Nights'' in its oldest form.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1093/adaptation/aps022|title=Pasolini's Splendid Infidelities: Un/Faithful Film Versions of ''The Thousand and One Nights''|first=Michael|last=Lundell|journal=Adaptation|volume=6|issue=1|year=2013|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=120–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]], an American animation studio, produced an animated feature version of ''[[1001 Arabian Nights (1959 film)|1001 Arabian Nights]]'' (1959), featuring the cartoon character [[Mr. Magoo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MaltinMiceMagic&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |year=1987 |publisher=New American Library |isbn=0-452-25993-2 |pages=341–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1949 animated film ''[[The Singing Princess]]'', another movie produced in Italy, is inspired by The Arabian Nights. The animated feature film, ''[[One Thousand and One Arabian Nights (film)|One Thousand and One Arabian Nights]]'' (1969), produced in [[Japan]] and directed by [[Osamu Tezuka]] and Eichii Yamamoto, featured [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] imagery and sounds, and erotic material intended for adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespinningimage.co.uk/cultfilms/displaycultfilm.asp?reviewid=4107 One Thousand and One Arabian Nights Review (1969)].

'''[[Traffic code|Traffic laws]]''' are the laws which govern traffic and regulate vehicles, while '''rules of the road''' are both the laws and the [[Norm (sociology)|informal rules]] that may have developed over time to facilitate the orderly and timely flow of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/traffic|title=Traffic definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized traffic generally has well-established priorities, lanes, [[Priority (right of way)|right-of-way]], and traffic control at [[intersection (road)|intersection]]s.

Traffic is formally organized in many jurisdictions, with marked [[lane]]s, [[Junction (traffic)|junction]]s, [[Intersection (road)|intersections]], [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s, [[traffic signal]]s, or [[traffic sign|sign]]s. Traffic is often classified by type: heavy [[motor vehicle]] (e.g., [[car]], [[truck]]), other vehicle (e.g., [[moped]], [[bicycle]]), and pedestrian.  Different classes may share [[speed limit]]s and easement, or may be segregated. Some jurisdictions may have very detailed and complex rules of the road while others rely more on drivers' common sense and willingness to cooperate.

Organization typically produces a better combination of [[travel safety]] and efficiency. Events which disrupt the flow and may cause traffic to degenerate into a disorganized mess include [[road construction]], [[car accident|collisions]], and [[debris in the roadway]]. On particularly busy freeways, a minor disruption may persist in a phenomenon known as [[traffic wave]]s. A complete breakdown of organization may result in [[traffic congestion]] and [[gridlock]]. Simulations of organized traffic frequently involve [[queuing theory]], [[stochastic process]]es and equations of [[mathematical physics]] applied to [[traffic flow]].

== Etymology and types ==
The word ''traffic'' originally meant &quot;trade&quot; (as it still does) and comes from the Old Italian verb ''trafficare'' and noun ''traffico''.  The origin of the Italian words is unclear.  Suggestions include [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''trafegar'' &quot;decant&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = traffic | year = 2013 | title = American Heritage Dictionary | edition = Fifth | chapter-url = http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=traffic | access-date = 23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an assumed [[Vulgar Latin]] verb ''transfricare'' 'rub across',&lt;ref name=etymonline&gt;{{cite web | title = traffic (n.) | year = 2001–2014 | last = Harper | first = Douglas | work = Online Etymological Dictionary | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=traffic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | access-date = 23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an assumed Vulgar Latin combination of ''trans-'' and ''facere'' 'make or do',&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt;&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite book | chapter = traffic, n. | title = OED Online | date = March 2014 | publisher = Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic]] ''tafriq'' 'distribution',&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt; and Arabic ''taraffaqa'', which can mean 'seek profit'.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; Broadly, the term covers many kinds of traffic including [[network traffic]], [[air traffic]], marine traffic and rail traffic, but it is often used narrowly to mean only road traffic.

== Rules of the road ==

'''Rules of the road''' and [[driving etiquette]] are the general practices and procedures that road users are required to follow. These rules usually apply to all road users, though they are of special importance to [[motor vehicle|motorists]] and [[bicycle|cyclists]]. These rules govern interactions between vehicles and with [[pedestrians]]. The basic traffic rules are defined by an international treaty under the authority of the United Nations, the 1968 ''[[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]]''. Not all countries are signatory to the convention and, even among signatories, local variations in practice may be found. There are also unwritten local rules of the road, which are generally understood by local drivers.

As a general rule, drivers are expected to avoid a collision with another vehicle and pedestrians, regardless of whether or not the applicable rules of the road allow them to be where they happen to be.&lt;ref&gt;''Davies v. Mann,'' 152 Eng. Rep. 588 (1842)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see [[Last clear chance|legal doctrine of Last Clear Chance]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the rules applicable by default, [[traffic sign]]s and [[traffic light]]s must be obeyed, and instructions may be given by a police officer, either routinely (on a busy crossing instead of traffic lights) or as [[road traffic control]] around a construction zone, accident, or other road disruption.

These rules should be distinguished from the mechanical procedures required to operate one's vehicle. See [[driving]].

===Directionality===
{{main|Bidirectional traffic|right- and left-hand traffic}}

Traffic going in opposite directions should be separated in such a way that they do not block each other's way. The most basic rule is whether to use the left or right side of the road.

===Traffic regulations===
{{see also|Category:Rules of the road}}

In many countries, the rules of the road are codified, setting out the legal requirements and [[punishments]] for breaking them.

In [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], the rules are set out in the [[Highway Code]], which includes not only obligations but also advice on how to drive sensibly and safely.

In [[United States|the United States]], traffic laws are regulated by the states and municipalities through their respective [[traffic code]]s. Most of these are based at least in part on the [[Uniform Vehicle Code]], but there are variations from state to state. In states such as Florida, [[traffic law]] and [[criminal law]] are separate, therefore, unless someone flees a scene of an accident, commits vehicular homicide or manslaughter, they are only guilty of a minor traffic offense. However, states such as [[South Carolina]] have completely criminalized their traffic law, so, for example, one is [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of a misdemeanor simply for travelling 5 miles over the speed limit.

==Organized traffic==
===Priority (right of way)===
&lt;!--This section is inlinked from many pages; please do not change the title.--&gt;
{{see also|Right-of-way (disambiguation)}}

Vehicles often come into conflict with other vehicles and pedestrians because their intended courses of travel intersect, and thus interfere with each other's routes. The general principle that establishes who has the right to go first is called &quot;right of way&quot;, or &quot;priority&quot;. It establishes who has the right to use the conflicting part of the road and who has to wait until the other does so.

Signs, signals, markings and other features are often used to make priority explicit. Some signs, such as the [[stop sign]], are nearly universal. When there are no signs or markings, different rules are observed depending on the location. These default priority rules differ between countries, and may even vary within countries. Trends toward uniformity are exemplified at an international level by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]], which prescribes standardized [[Road traffic control device|traffic control devices]] (signs, signals, and markings) for establishing the right of way where necessary.

==United States==
Electoral fusion was once widespread in the [[United States]]. In the late nineteenth century, however, as minor political parties such as the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] became increasingly successful in using fusion, state legislatures enacted bans against it.  One Republican Minnesota state legislator was clear about what his party was trying to do: &quot;We don't propose to allow the Democrats to make allies of the Populists, Prohibitionists, or any other party, and get up combination tickets against us.  We can whip them single-handed, but don't intend to fight all creation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Spoiling for a Fight: Third-Party Politics in America|pages = 227-228|first = Micah L. |last = Sifry|isbn= 978-0415931434|publisher =Routledge|date =2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The birth of the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] made this particular tactical position obsolete. By 1907 the practice had been banned in 18 states; today, fusion as conventionally practiced remains legal in only eight states, namely:
*[[California]] (Presidential elections only)
*[[Connecticut]]
*[[Delaware]]
*[[Idaho]]
*[[Mississippi]]
*[[New York (state)|New York]]
*[[Oregon]]
*[[South Carolina]]
*[[Vermont]]

In several other states,{{which|date=January 2014}} notably [[New Hampshire]], fusion is legal when primary elections are won by [[write-in candidate|write-in candidates]].

Fusion has sometimes been used by other third parties. For example, the [[Independent Party of Oregon]] cross-nominated five major party candidates, winning races for the U.S. Senate, Oregon State Treasurer, and the Oregon House of Representatives in 2008.  The [[Libertarian Party of New Hampshire]] used fusion to elect four members, [[Calvin Warburton]], [[Finlay Rothhaus]], [[Andy Borsa]] and [[Don Gorman]], to the [[New Hampshire]] state legislature during the early 1990s.

In [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]] the Democratic Party split into two wings over the question of whether to continue the [[American Civil War]] or back down and negotiate peace with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The [[War Democrats]] fused with the Republicans to elect a Democratic vice president, [[Andrew Johnson]], and re-elect a Republican president, [[Abraham Lincoln]].

In [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], both the newly formed [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]] and the Democratic party nominated the Liberal Republican [[Horace Greeley]] as their candidate for President of the United States: &quot;If [The Democratic party] was to stand any chance at all against Grant, it must avoid putting up a candidate of its own who would merely split the opposition vote. It must take Greeley.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hale, William Harlan (1950). Horace Greeley: Voice of the People. Harper &amp; Brothers. {{OCLC|336934}}. p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1896 United States presidential election|Presidential election of 1896]], [[William Jennings Bryan]] was nominated by both the Democratic Party and the Populist Party, albeit with different Vice Presidential candidates, [[Arthur Sewall]] for the Democrats and [[Thomas E. Watson]] for the Populists. This election led to the downfall of the Populist Party, especially in Southern states (such as Watson's Georgia, as well as North Carolina and Tennessee) where the Populist party had engaged in electoral fusion or other alliances with Republicans against the dominant [[Bourbon Democrat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.missouristate.edu/wrmiller/Populism/Texts/Documents/Bibliography/african_American.htm |title=African |publisher=History.missouristate.edu |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307005107/http://history.missouristate.edu/wrmiller/Populism/texts/Documents/Bibliography/african_American.htm |archivedate=March 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A00E7DF1231E033A2575AC0A9679D94659ED7CF | work=The New York Times | title=Senate and House Secured; Republican control in the next Conress assured.

Occasionally, popular candidates for local office have succeeded in being nominated by both Republican and Democratic Parties.  In 1946, prior to the current ban on fusion being enacted in that state, Republican [[Governor of California]] [[Earl Warren]] (a future [[Chief Justice of the United States]]) managed to win the nominations of the Republican, Democratic, and Progressive Parties.  Similarly, [[Allan Shivers]] won the 1952 nominations of both the Democratic and Republican parties in Texas (and had his name appear on the ballot twice, once for each party; Democrat Shivers handily defeated Republican Shivers in the general election).

In 1996 the United States Supreme Court ruled that prohibiting Electoral Fusion does not violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution (''[[Twin Cities Area New Party v. McKenna]]'', 73 F. 3d 196, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/95-1608.ZS.html| title=Timmons v.

[[Donald Trump]] appeared on the [[United States presidential election in California, 2016|2016 presidential ballot in California]] with two ballot labels by his name,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Winger, [http://ballot-access.org/2016/08/13/american-independent-party-formally-nominates-donald-trump-and-michael-pence/ American Independent Party Formally Nominates Donald Trump and Michael Pence], ''Ballot Access News'' (August 13, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; as the nominee of both the Republican Party and the [[American Independent Party]], a small [[far-right]] party.  Trump was the first fusion presidential candidate on the California ballot in at least eighty years.&lt;ref&gt;John Myers, [http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-donald-trump-california-ballot-american-independent-party-20160815-snap-story.html Donald Trump will be the nominee of two parties on California's November ballot], ''Los Angeles Times'' (August 15, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milwaukee===
In [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], during the heyday of the [[Sewer Socialism|Sewer Socialists]], the Republican and Democratic parties would agree not to run candidates against each other in some districts, concentrating instead on defeating the Socialists. These candidates were usually called &quot;[[nonpartisan#Milwaukee|non-partisan]]&quot;, but sometimes were termed &quot;fusion&quot; candidates instead.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Fusion In Many Districts; Old Parties Unite On Legislative Candidates&quot; ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' November 1, 1918; p. 9, col. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
{{See also|Elections in New York|Qualified New York political parties}}

Fusion has the highest profile in the state of New York and particularly New York City, where it was used as a major weapon against [[Tammany Hall]].  Most legislative and [[New York Supreme Court#Elections|judicial elections]] are won by candidates endorsed by more than two parties.

The first fusion gubernatorial election was held in New York in 1854, in which the major party Whig candidate was supported in a fusion candidacy by eleven other political parties, among them the &quot;Strong-Minded Women&quot; Party, the &quot;Anti-Rent&quot; Party and the &quot;Negro&quot; Party.

In order to obtain or maintain automatic ballot access, a party's candidate for [[governor of New York]] must receive 50,000 votes on that party's line. The party need not run its own candidate and may cross-nominate another party's candidate, but in order to qualify for automatic ballot access it must receive 50,000 votes on its own line. Gubernatorial vote also determines ballot order, with Row &quot;A&quot; going to the party whose line gains the most votes (regardless of whether or not their candidate actually wins &amp;ndash; see the [[1994 New York gubernatorial election|1994 election]] for an example).

Automatic ballot access means that no petitions need be filed to gain access to a ballot line for statewide and special elections, and parties may designate candidates through their own conventions. (Legislative candidates must petition onto the ballot regardless of party designation.)  For local (non-statewide) office, the number of signatures required to place a candidate on the ballot is much lower for qualified parties, and they are the only parties eligible to hold primary elections. Automatic ballot access is valid for four years, and parties must gain 50,000 votes in the next gubernatorial election to again qualify for automatic ballot access.

Small parties are significant in large part for their fused ballot lines, include the [[Independence Party of New York]], the [[Working Families Party]], and the [[Conservative Party of New York State]].  The Independence Party ran its own candidate for governor until 2002, but since then has instead retained its automatic ballot status by running a gubernatorial candidate who was designated by one of the major parties (to date, the party has always cross-endorsed the Democrat in gubernatorial races; it cross-endorses Republicans in lower races, particularly in the [[New York State Senate]], whose Republican conference has strong ties to the party).  Previously influential were the [[Liberal Party of New York]] and the [[New York State Right to Life Party]], which lost automatic [[ballot access]] in 2002.

Other parties, such as the [[Libertarian Party of New York]], the [[Green Party of New York]], and others, now seek ballot access by, first, getting a gubernatorial candidate on the ballot via [[petition]] (by collecting 15,000 valid signatures of [[registered voters]]), and then by getting 50,000 votes for that candidate on their line. As a general rule, neither party uses electoral fusion, and both rely on their own candidates. The Green Party, which had first achieved ballot status in 1998, failed to gain 50,000 votes and also lost its ballot status in 2002, but regained its line when the 2010 election results were certified. In 2018, Larry Sharpe, the Libertarian Party candidate for governor, received over 90,000 votes, giving the party ballot status for the first time in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nyenr.elections.ny.gov/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120174014/https://nyenr.elections.ny.gov/ |archive-date=2018-11-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Party, which had been active since 1944, became defunct as a result of the [[2002 New York gubernatorial election|2002 gubernatorial election]]. [[Andrew Cuomo]] got the Liberal Party nomination and ran in the Democratic primary against [[Carl McCall]], who had secured the Working Families nomination.  Cuomo subsequently dropped out and endorsed McCall, but his name remained on the Liberal party line and failed to gain 50,000 votes, leading to the Liberal Party's failure to retain status and losing its automatic ballot line.  A Federal lawsuit (joined by Green, Libertarian, and other parties) enjoined the Board of Elections from discarding enrollment records of these disqualified parties, and also required modifications to allow voters to register themselves in non-ballot parties.

In July 2019, the New York Legislature passed a budget bill that included the creation of a Public Campaign Financing Commission, which was given authority to investigate and create rules for [[public financing of campaigns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-legislative-leaders-announce-members-public-campaign-financing-commission|title=Governor Cuomo &amp; Legislative Leaders Announce Members of the Public Campaign Financing Commission|date=July 3, 2019|website=Governor Andrew M.

===Oregon===
Prior to 1958, Oregon practiced a form of fusion that required the state to list multiple nominating parties on the candidate's ballot line. [[Sylvester Pennoyer]] was elected governor in 1886 and 1890 as a candidate of the Democratic and People's Parties.  In 1906, seven members of the Oregon House were also elected as candidates of the [[Populist Party (United States)|People's Party]] and either the Democratic or Republican parties.  In 2008, a lawsuit was brought by the [[Independent Party of Oregon]] against the Oregon Secretary of State claiming that modifications to the ballot design statute in 1995 once again required the state to list multiple nominating parties on the candidate's ballot line.  The lawsuit gave rise to legislation&lt;ref name=&quot;SB326&quot;&gt;http://www.leg.state.or.us/09reg/measures/sb300.dir/sb326.a.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow candidates to list up to three party labels after their name.  This bill passed both houses of the Oregon legislature during the 2009 legislative session.  Governor [[Ted Kulongoski]] signed the bill into law on July 23, 2009.

'''Bodily harm''' is a legal term of art used in the definition of both [[statutory]] and [[common law]] offences in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]] and other common law jurisdictions. It is a synonym for [[injury]] or [[bodily injury]] and similar expressions, though it may be used with a precise and limited meaning in any given jurisdiction. The expression [[grievous bodily harm]] first appeared in a statute in [[Lord Ellenborough's Act]] (1803).

==Canada==

In the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], &quot;bodily harm&quot; is defined as &quot;any hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the person and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-1.html#h-2 RSC 1985, c C-46, s 2 &quot;bodily harm&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==

The expression is not defined by any statute. It currently appears in a number of offences under the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (ss. 18, 20, 23, 26, 28, 29, 31, 35, and 47) and in the offence of [[burglary]] under the [[Theft Act 1968]] (s. 9). It is also used in the definition of [[Murder in English law|murder]] (as it appears in case law) in the guise of grievous bodily harm.

'''Psychiatric disorder'''

Non-physical or ''psychiatric injury'' can be considered &quot;bodily harm&quot; whether &quot;actual&quot; or &quot;grievous&quot;, but there must be formal medical evidence to verify the injury.

In R v Ireland, R v Burstow, Lord Steyn said:

{{Blockquote|The proposition that the Victorian legislator when enacting sections 18, 20 and 47 of the Act 1861, would not have had in mind psychiatric illness is no doubt correct. [[Psychiatry]] was in its infancy in 1861.}}

In modern times, the practice of [[statutory interpretation]] frequently refers to the actual intention of the draftsman as expressed in the words of the Act, but considered in the light of contemporary knowledge. [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1993/1.html ''R v. Chan Fook'']&lt;ref&gt;R v Chan Fook [1994] 1 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 689, [1994] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 552, (1993) 99 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 147, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]] (22 October 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; applied this approach.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Hobhouse LJ. said the prosecution &quot;chose to introduce into the case an allegation that even if Mr Martins had suffered no physical injury at all as a result of the assault upon him by the Appellant, he had nevertheless been reduced to a mental state which in itself, without more, amounted to actual bodily harm. The only evidence to which the prosecution could point in support of this allegation was the evidence of Mr Martins that he felt abused and humiliated, that he had been threatened with further violence, and that he was very frightened. There was no medical or psychiatric evidence to support the allegation. There was no evidence that he was in a state of shock at any time prior to receiving the injuries which he suffered as a result of falling from the window.&quot;

Hobhouse LJ. said:

{{Blockquote|The first question on the present appeal is whether the inclusion of the word &quot;bodily&quot; is the phrase &quot;actual bodily harm&quot; limits harm to harm to the skin, flesh and bones of the victim. Mr Justice Lynskey rejected this submission. In our judgment he was right to do so. The body of the victim includes all parts of his body, including his organs, his nervous system and his brain. Bodily injury therefore may include injury to any of those parts of his body responsible for his mental and other faculties.}}

He went on to say:

{{Blockquote|Accordingly the phrase &quot;actual bodily harm&quot; is capable of include psychiatric injury. But it does not include mere emotions such as fear or distress nor panic nor does it include, as such, states of mind that are not themselves evidence of some identifiable clinical condition.}}

He said that juries &quot;should not be directed that an assault which causes a hysterical and nervous condition is an assault occasioning actual bodily harm&quot;.

This was followed by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] in [[R v Constanza]],&lt;ref&gt;[1997] 2 Cr App R 492, (1997) The Times, 31 March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[House of Lords]] which confirmed the principle in [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html ''R v Burstow'', ''R v Ireland''].&lt;ref&gt;R v Ireland, R v Burstow [1998] 1 Cr App R 177, [1997] 3 WLR 534, [1998] AC 147, [1997] 4 All ER 225, [[House of Lords|HL]] (24 July 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland caused three women to suffer psychiatric illness. Burstow's victim was fearful of personal violence and was diagnosed as suffering from a severe [[depressive illness]]. The best medical practice today accepts a link between the body and psychiatric injury, so the words &quot;bodily harm&quot; in sections 20 and 47 were capable of covering recognised psychiatric illnesses, such as an [[anxiety disorder]]s or a depressive disorder, which affect the central nervous system of the body. However, to qualify, those neuroses must be more than simple states of fear, or problems in coping with everyday life, which do not amount to psychiatric illnesses.

'''Venereal and other communicable disease'''

See [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/1103.html R v. Dica] [2004] EWCA Crim 1103

The Law Commission stated its view that &quot;the deliberate or reckless causing of disease should not be beyond the reach of the criminal law&quot; and there is continuing debate over whether the transmission of [[HIV]] is covered as grievous bodily harm or under sections 22 to 24 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

In R v Clarence,&lt;ref&gt;R v Clarence (1888) 22 QBD 23, (1888) 16 Cox 511, (1888) 5 [[Times Law Reports|TLR]] 61, (1888) 53 JP 149, [[Court for Crown Cases Reserved|CCR]]&lt;/ref&gt; it appeared that at a time when the prisoner knew, but his wife did not know, that he was suffering from gonorhoea, he had &quot;connection&quot; with her; that the result was that the disease was communicated to her, and that had she been aware of the prisoner's condition she would not have submitted to the intercourse.

Lord Coleridge CJ., Pollock and Huddleston BB., Stephen, Manisty, Mathew, A L Smith, Wills and Grantham JJ., held that the conduct of the prisoner did not amount to an offence under either section 20 or section 47. Field, Hawkins, Day and Charles JJ. dissented.

Wills J. said &quot;the facts are ... that he infected her, and that from such infection she suffered grievous bodily harm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R v Clarence (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 27, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkins J. said:

{{Blockquote|In this condition of things the prisoner had sexual intercourse with his wife and in doing so communicated to her his disease and thereby caused her grievous bodily harm.&lt;ref&gt;R v Clarence (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 46, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;}}

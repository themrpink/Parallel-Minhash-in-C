'''Aristid Lindenmayer''' (17 November 1925 – 30 October 1989) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[biologist]]. In 1968 he developed a type of [[formal languages]] that is today called [[L-system]]s or Lindenmayer Systems. Using those systems Lindenmayer modelled the behaviour of cells of plants. L-systems nowadays are also used to model whole plants.

[[Image:Fractal weeds.jpg|thumb|300px|Plant representations generated using an L-system in 3D.]]
Lindenmayer worked with [[yeast]] and filamentous [[fungi]] and studied the growth patterns of various types of algae, such as the blue/green bacteria [[Anabaena|''Anabaena catenula'']]. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.

==Career==
Lindenmayer studied chemistry and biology at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] from 1943 to 1948. He received his Ph.D. in [[plant physiology]] in
1956 at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin1974&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James Franklin|title=The Rhode Island Almanack|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TIIAAAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=John Carter Brown Library|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 he became professor in Philosophy of Life Sciences and Biology at the [[Utrecht University|University of Utrecht]], The Netherlands. From 1972 onward he headed the Theoretical Biology Group at Utrecht University.&lt;ref&gt;Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz, Martin de Boer (1991) Obituary Aristid Lindenmayer (1925-1989), ''Int. J.

{{listen|filename=Margie on JBS steam calliope.ogg |title='Margie'|description=Performed on the steam calliope of the &lt;br&gt; Str. [[Julia Belle Swain]] |format=[[ogg]]}}
A '''calliope''' (see [[#Pronunciation|below]] for pronunciation) is a [[musical instrument]] that produces sound by sending a gas, originally [[steam]] or, more recently, [[compressed air]], through large [[whistle]]s—originally locomotive whistles.

A calliope is typically very loud. Even some small calliopes are audible for miles. There is no way to vary [[timbre (music)|tone]] or [[dynamics (music)|loudness]]. Musically, the only [[musical expression|expression]] possible is the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[rhythm]], and [[duration (music)|duration]] of the notes.

The steam calliope is also known as a '''steam [[Pipe organ|organ]]''' or '''steam piano'''. The air-driven calliope is sometimes called a '''calliaphone''', the name given to it by [[Norman Baker (inventor)|Norman Baker]], but the &quot;Calliaphone&quot; name is registered by the Miner Company for instruments produced under the Tangley name.

In the [[Steam power during the Industrial Revolution|age of steam]], the steam calliope was particularly used on riverboats and in circuses. In both cases, a steam supply was readily available for other purposes. Riverboats supplied steam from their propulsion boilers. Circus calliopes were sometimes installed in steam-drive [[carousel]]s, or supplied with steam from a [[traction engine]]. The traction engine could also supply electric power for lighting, and tow the calliope in the circus parade, where it traditionally came last. Other circus calliopes were self-contained, mounted on a carved, painted and gilded wagon pulled by horses, but the presence of other steam boilers in the circus meant that fuel and expertise to run the boiler were readily available. Steam instruments often had keyboards made from brass. This was in part to resist the heat and moisture of the steam, but also for the golden shine of the highly polished keys.

Calliopes can be played by a player at a [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] or mechanically. Mechanical operation may be by a drum similar to a [[music box]] drum, or by a [[Piano roll|roll]] similar to that of a [[player piano]]. Some instruments have both a keyboard and a mechanism for automated operation, others only one or the other.  Some calliopes can also be played via a [[MIDI]] interface.

The whistles of a calliope are tuned to a [[chromatic scale]], although this process is difficult and must be repeated often to maintain quality sound.  Since the pitch of each note is largely affected by the temperature of the steam, accurate tuning is nearly impossible; however, the off-pitch notes (particularly in the upper register) have become something of a trademark of the steam calliope.  A calliope may have anywhere from 25 to 67 whistles, but 32 is traditional for a steam calliope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/music/musichistory/natchezcalliope.html |title=The Steam Calliope on Steamboat Natchez |publisher=Neworleansonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joshua C. Stoddard]] of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] patented the calliope on October 9, 1855,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patent US 13668: Apparatus for producing music by steam or compressed air.|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US13668.pdf|publisher=United States Patent Office|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bopp|first1=Ron|title=Whistling By The Numbers (A Survey of the Calliope in the U.S. Patents)|journal=Carousel Organ|date=April 2004|issue=19|page=2|url=http://www.coaa.us/index_archive/Issues_11_to_20/Whistling%20By%20The%20Numbers%20-%20Survey%20of%20Calliope%20Patents_%20Ron%20Bopp__19.pdf|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his design echos previous concepts, such as an 1832 instrument called a ''steam trumpet,'' later known as a [[train whistle]]. In 1851, William Hoyt of Dupont, Indiana claimed to have conceived of a device similar to Stoddard's calliope, but he never patented it. Later, an employee of Stoddard's American Music, Arthur S. Denny, attempted to market an &quot;Improved Kalliope&quot; in Europe, but it did not catch on. In 1859, he demonstrated this instrument in [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], London. Unlike other calliopes before or since, Denny's Improved Kalliope let the player control the steam pressure, and therefore the volume of the music, while playing.

While Stoddard originally intended the calliope to replace bells at churches, it found its way onto riverboats during the [[Paddle steamer|paddlewheel]] era. While only a small number of working steamboats still exist, each has a steam calliope. These boats include the ''[[Delta Queen]]'', the ''Belle of Louisville'', and ''[[President (1924 steamboat)|President]]''. Their calliopes are played regularly on river excursions. Many surviving calliopes were built by '''Thomas J. Nichol''', [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], who built calliopes from 1890 until 1932. The Thomas J. Nichol calliopes featured rolled sheet copper (as used in roofing) for the resonant tube (the bell) of the whistle, lending a sweeter tone than cast bronze or brass, which were the usual materials for steam whistles of the day. David Morecraft pioneered a resurgence in the building of authentic steam calliopes of the Thomas J. Nichol style beginning in 1985 in [[Peru, Indiana]]. These calliopes are featured in Peru's annual Circus City Parade.  Morecraft died on December 5, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dahlinger |first1=Fred |title=Passing of Dave Morecraft, Steam Calliope Builder |url=https://www.mmdigest.com/Archives/Digests/201612/2016.12.06.01.html |website=Mechanical Music Archives |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoddard's original calliope was attached to a metal roller set with pins in the manner familiar to Stoddard from the contemporary clockwork [[music box]]. The pins on the roller opened valves that admitted steam into the whistles.  Later, Stoddard replaced the cylinder with a keyboard, so that the calliope could be played like an organ.

Starting in the 1900’s calliopes began using [[music roll]]s instead of a live musician. The music roll operated in a similar manner to a [[piano roll]] in a [[player piano]], mechanically operating the keys. Many of these mechanical calliopes retained keyboards, allowing a live musician to play them if needed. During this period, compressed air began to replace steam as the vehicle of producing sound.

Most calliopes disappeared in the mid-20th century, as steam power was replaced with other power sources. Without the demand for technicians that mines and railroads supplied, no support was available to keep boilers running. Only a few calliopes have survived, and these are rarely played.

=={{anchor|Pronunciation}}Pronunciation==

The pronunciation of the word has long been disputed, and often it is pronounced differently inside and outside the groups that use it. The [[Calliope|Greek muse]] by the same name is pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|ə|p|i}} {{respell|kə|LY|ə|pee}}, but the instrument was usually pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|l|i|oʊ|p}} {{respell|KAL|ee|ohp}} by people who played it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} A nineteenth century magazine, ''[[Reedy's Mirror]]'', attempted to settle the dispute by publishing this rhyme:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the song &quot;[[Blinded by the Light]]&quot;, written in 1972, [[Bruce Springsteen]] used the four-syllable ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|ə|p|i}}) pronunciation when referring to a fairground organ, and this was repeated by [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]] in their 1976 [[Cover version|cover]].

==Related instruments==

===Pyrophone===
The calliope is similar to the [[pyrophone]]. The difference between the two is that the calliope is an external combustion instrument and the pyrophone is an internal combustion instrument.

At 1998's [[Burning Man]], a pyrophone referred to as ''Satan's Calliope'' was powered by ignition of propane inside resonant cavities.  This device was incorrectly referred to as a &quot;calliope&quot;, since a calliope is an external combustion instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hell's Bells: An engineer's devilish art car produces great balls of fire at Burning Man|author=Sarah Phelan|work= Metroactive|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/08.22.01/burningman-0134.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calliaphone===
The Calliaphone is an invention of [[Norman G. Baker|Norman Baker]]. He developed
an air-blown (versus steam) instrument that could be easily transported.

===Lustre chantant===
The ''lustre chantant'' (literally &quot;singing chandelier&quot;) or musical lamp, invented by Frederik Kastner, was a large chandelier with glass pipes of varying lengths each illuminated and heated by an individual gas jet. A keyboard allowed the player to turn down individual jets; as the glass tube cooled, a note was produced. Kastner installed several such instruments in Paris.

==Popular culture==
[[The Beatles]], in recording &quot;[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]&quot; from the album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]],'' used tapes of calliope music to create the atmosphere of a circus. Beatles producer [[George Martin]] recalled, &quot;When we first worked on 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!' John had said that he wanted to 'smell the sawdust on the floor', wanted to taste the atmosphere of the circus.  I said to him, 'What we need is a calliope.' 'A what?' 'Steam whistles, played by a keyboard.{{'&quot;}} Unable to find an authentic calliope, Martin resorted to tapes of calliopes playing [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]] marches. &quot;[I] chopped the tapes up into small sections and had [[Geoff Emerick]] throw them up into the air, re-assembling them at random.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' by King Crimson, the main theme of the title song is played on a calliope towards the end of the piece.

During [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s [[The Girlie Show World Tour|The Girlie Show]] tour, during the encore for &quot;Holiday&quot;, the credits include the statement, &quot;contains excerpts from ''Holiday for Calliope'',&quot; which was, in general, the hook for &quot;Holiday&quot; played with a calliope. Additionally, a generalized circus theme was played with a calliope sound through part of the song.

In the web series ''[[Bravest Warriors]]'', there is a theoretical system (similar to [[string theory]]) humorously dubbed the &quot;Space Time Calliope&quot; in which an infinite number of universes and timelines exist. The name is possibly referencing the mechanical complexity of calliopes.

The [[Bruce Springsteen]] song more popularly covered by [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]] &quot;[[Blinded by the Light]]&quot; contains the line &quot;the calliope crashed to the ground&quot;.

The [[Barclay James Harvest]] song &quot;Medicine Man&quot; uses the lyric &quot;And didn't anybody want to ask the calliope to call the tune&quot;. This song was a great concert favourite and concerned a sinister travelling fair and carousel.

At one point in the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode &quot;Free Samples&quot;, SpongeBob uses a calliope to lure potential customers to his free samples stand. Instead, the calliope does the opposite.

In ''[[The Red Green Show]]'' episode &quot;Out of the Woods&quot;, Red makes a calliope using a v8 engine and an assortment of old exhaust pipes.

In ''[[Girl Genius]]'', the main character Agatha Heterodyne is given a calliope to repair by a travelling circus that had been wrecked, and thought to be beyond repair, in volumes 4 and 5. In the climax of volume 6, it is revealed she had modified it to control an army of small robots.

In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s novel ''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]'', the theater-owner's daughter who sells banged grains and sings between shows is named &quot;Calliope&quot;, which may be used to evoke the ornate movie house as &quot;temple&quot; of ancient gods, or else a play on the daughter's singing abilities.

On [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s [[Wheels of Fire]] album, [[Jack Bruce]] is credited as playing the calliope on the song [[Passing the Time]].

The 2013 video game ''[[Bioshock Infinite]]'' features an audio track of an instrumental calliope cover of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s 1983 single &quot;[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]&quot;, and is heard as the player progresses through the &quot;Battleship Bay&quot; area of the fictional city of Columbia. This song appears as one of a number of anachronisms that occur within the context of the game's story, as it takes place decades before the song was composed in the real-world timeline.

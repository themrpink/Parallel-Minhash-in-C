The '''Carthusians''', also known as the '''Order of Carthusians''' ({{lang-la|Ordo Cartusiensis}}), are an [[enclosed religious order]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The order was founded by [[Bruno of Cologne]] in 1084 and includes both [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s. The order has its own rule, called the ''Statutes'', and their life combines both [[hermit|eremitical]] and [[cenobitic monasticism]]. The motto of the Carthusians is ''Stat crux dum volvitur orbis'', Latin for &quot;The [[Christian cross|Cross]] is steady while the world is turning.&quot;

The name ''Carthusian'' is derived from the [[Chartreuse Mountains]] in the [[French Prealps]]: Saint Bruno built his first hermitage in a valley of these mountains. These names were adapted to the English ''[[Charterhouse (monastery)|charterhouse]]'', meaning a Carthusian [[monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;In other languages: {{lang-nl|Kartuize}}; {{lang-fr|Chartreuse}}; {{lang-de|Kartause}}; {{lang-it|Certosa}}; {{lang-pl|Kartuzja}}; {{lang-es|Cartuja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are 23 charterhouses, 18 for monks and 5 for nuns. The alcoholic [[cordial (medicine)|cordial]] [[Chartreuse (liqueur)|Chartreuse]] has been produced by the monks of [[Grande Chartreuse]] since 1737, which gave rise to the name of the [[chartreuse (color)|colour]].

==History==
In 1084 Bishop [[Hugh of Châteauneuf|Hugh of Grenoble]] offered Bruno, the former Chancellor of the Diocese of Reims, a solitary site in the mountains of his diocese, in the valley of Chartreuse.  There Bruno and six companions built a hermitage, consisting of a few log cabins opening towards a gallery that allowed them access to the communal areas, the church, refectory, and chapter room without having to suffer too much from inclement conditions.&lt;ref name=tco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartreux.org/en/|title=Welcome|first=L'Ordre des|last=Chartreux|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six years later, Bruno's former pupil, [[Pope Urban II]], requested his services.  He would only live in Rome for a few short months however, before leaving to establish a new hermitage in the forests of Calabria, in the south of Italy, with a few new companions. He died there on 6 October 1101.&lt;ref name=tco/&gt;

In 1132, an avalanche destroyed the first hermitage, killing 7 monks under the snow. The fifth prior of Chartreuse, [[Guigo I|Guiges]], rebuilt the hermitage.&lt;ref name=tco/&gt;

===Carthusians in Britain===
There were ten Carthusian monasteries in the British Isles before the Reformation, with one in Scotland and nine in England. The first was founded by [[Henry II of England]] in 1181 at [[Witham Friary]], [[Somerset]] as penance for the murder of [[Thomas Becket|St. Thomas Becket]]. [[Hugh of Lincoln|St. Hugh of Lincoln]] was its first prior.&lt;ref name=hugh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parkminster.org.uk/site.php?use=default|title=The Carthusian Order|publisher=St. Hugh's Charterhouse|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third Charterhouse built in Britain was [[Beauvale Priory]], remains of which can still be seen in [[Beauvale]], [[Greasley]], [[Nottinghamshire]].

The Carthusians, as with all Catholic religious orders, were variously persecuted and banned during the [[Reformation]]. The abolition of their priories, which were sources of charity in England, particularly reduced their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/surrey/vol2/pp89-94 'House of Carthusian monks: Priory of Sheen'] A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 2, ed. H E Malden (London, 1967), pp. 89–94 Accessed 15 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the [[French Revolution]] which had a similar effect in France.&lt;ref name=Raymond/&gt;

A few fragments remain of the Charterhouse in [[Coventry]], mostly dating from the 15th century, and consisting of a sandstone building that was probably the prior's house. The area, about a mile from the centre of the city, is a conservation area, but the buildings are in use as part of a local college. Inside the building is a medieval wall painting, alongside many carvings and wooden beams. Nearby is the river Sherbourne that runs underneath the centre of the city.

The best preserved remains of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Charterhouse in the UK are at [[Mount Grace Priory]] near [[Osmotherley, North Yorkshire]]. One of the cells has been reconstructed to illustrate how different the lay-out is from monasteries of most other Christian orders, which are normally designed with communal living in mind.

The [[London Charterhouse]] gave its name to [[Charterhouse Square]] and several streets in the [[City of London]], as well as to the [[Charterhouse School]] which used part of its site before moving out to [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]].
Nothing remains at Hull or Sheen, although Hull Charterhouse is an alms house which shared the site of the monastery. Axholme, Hinton, and Witham have slight remains.

[[Perth Charterhouse]], the single Carthusian Priory founded in [[Scotland]] during the [[Middle Ages]], was located in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]. It stood just west of the medieval town and was founded by [[James I of Scotland|James I]] (1406–1437) in the early 15th century. James I and [[Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots]] (died 1445) were both buried in the priory church, as was Queen [[Margaret Tudor]] (died 1541), widow of [[James IV of Scotland]]. The Priory, said to have been a building of 'wondrous cost and greatness' was sacked during the [[Scottish Reformation]] in 1559, and swiftly fell into decay. No remains survive above ground, though a Victorian monument marks the site. The Perth names Charterhouse Lane and Pomarium Flats (built on the site of the Priory's orchard) recall its existence.

There is an active Carthusian house in England, [[St Hugh's Charterhouse, Parkminster]], West Sussex. This has cells around a square cloister approximately 400 m (one quarter mile) on a side, making it the largest cloister in Europe. It was built in the 19th century to accommodate two communities which were expelled from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;The Monastery, BBC, broadcast May 2005, about 20 minutes into third episode.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charterhouse ==
The monastery is generally a small community of hermits based on the model of the 4th century Lauras of Palestine. A Carthusian monastery consists of a number of individual cells built around a cloister. The individual cells are organised so that the door of each cell comes off a large corridor.

The focus of Carthusian life is contemplation. To this end there is an emphasis on solitude and silence.&lt;ref name=trans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transfiguration.chartreux.org/index.htm|title=Charterhouse of the Transfiguration|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carthusians do not have [[abbot]]s — instead, each charterhouse is headed by a [[prior]] and is populated by two types of monks: the [[choir monk]]s, referred to as [[hermit]]s, and the lay brothers. This reflects a division of labor in providing for the material needs of the monastery and the monks. For the most part, the number of brothers in the Order has remained the same for centuries, as it is now: seven or eight brothers for every ten fathers.&lt;ref name=voc/&gt; Humility is a characteristic of Carthusian spirituality. The Carthusian identity is one of shared solitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zak&quot; /&gt;

===Choirmonks===
[[File:Christus carthusian.jpg|thumb|Carthusian monk depicted in [[Petrus Christus]]'s painting ''[[Portrait of a Carthusian]]''.]]

Each hermit, a monk who is or who will be a priest, has his own living space, called a cell, usually consisting of a small dwelling. Traditionally there is a one-room lower floor for the storage of wood for a stove and a workshop as all monks engage in some manual labour. A second floor consists of a small entryway with an image of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Catholic)|Virgin Mary]] as a place of prayer and a larger room containing a bed, a table for eating meals, a desk for study, a choir stall, and a kneeler for prayer. Each cell has a high walled garden wherein the monk may meditate as well as grow flowers for himself and/or vegetables for the common good of the community, as a form of physical exercise.&lt;ref name=Zak/&gt;
[[File:Plan.chartreuse.Clermont.png|thumb|right|A typical Carthusian plan: Clermont, drawn by [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], 1856.]]

Next to the door is a small revolving compartment, called a &quot;turn&quot;, so that meals and other items may be passed in and out of the cell without the hermit having to meet the bearer. Most meals are provided in this manner, which the hermit then eats in the solitude of his cell. There are two meals provided for much of the year: lunch and supper. During seasons or days of [[fasting]], just one meal is provided. The hermit makes his needs known to the lay brother by means of a note, requesting items such as a fresh loaf of bread, which will be kept in the cell for eating with several meals. Carthusians observe a perpetual abstinence from meat.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

The hermit spends most of his day in the cell: he meditates, prays the minor hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] on his own, eats, studies and writes, and works in his garden or at some manual trade. Unless required by other duties, the Carthusian hermit leaves his cell daily only for three prayer services in the monastery chapel, including the community Mass, and occasionally for conferences with his superior. Additionally, once a week, the community members take a long walk in the countryside during which they may speak. On Sundays and solemn feast days a community meal is taken in silence.&lt;ref name=hugh/&gt; Twice a year there is a day-long community recreation, and the monk may receive an annual visit from immediate family members.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===Lay brothers===
There have always been lay brothers in the charterhouse. When Saint Bruno retired to the Chartreuse, two of his companions were secular ones: Andrew and Guerin. They also live a life of solitary prayer and join in the communal prayer and mass in the chapel. However, the [[lay brothers]] are monks under a slightly different type of vows and spend less time in contemplative prayer and more time in manual labour. The lay brothers provide material assistance to the choir monks: cooking meals, doing laundry, undertaking physical repairs, providing the choir monks with books from the library and managing supplies. The life of the brothers complements that of the choir monks, and makes the fathers' lives of seclusion possible.&lt;ref name=Zak&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wwSQBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=Carthusian+choir+monks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eQvNPAyjWC&amp;sig=C80-UAv9PF0q7q7azSNtwoqMSbc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih0O2imdvWAhWH6SYKHaP4B68Q6AEIcDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=Carthusian%20choir%20monks&amp;f=false McNary-Zak, Bernadette. ''Seeking in Solitude'', Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2014] {{ISBN|9781606089699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the brothers' seven-year formation period, some time is given each day to the study of the Bible, theology, titurgy, and spirituality. They can continue their studies throughout their lives. All of the monks live lives of silence.

The Carthusians do not engage in work of a pastoral or missionary nature. Unlike most monasteries, they do not have retreatants, and those who visit for a prolonged period are people who are contemplating entering the monastery.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; As far as possible, the monks have no contact with the outside world.

Carthusian nuns live a life similar to the monks, but with some differences. Choir nuns tend to lead somewhat less [[eremitical]] lives, while still maintaining a strong commitment to solitude and silence.

== Modern Carthusians ==
[[File:La Grande Chartreuse.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Grande Chartreuse]]'' is the head [[monastery]] of the Carthusian order.]]
Today, the monastery of the [[Grande Chartreuse]] is still the Motherhouse of the Order. There is a museum illustrating the history of the Carthusian order next to Grande Chartreuse; the monks of that monastery are also involved in producing [[Chartreuse liqueur]]. Visits are not possible into the Grande Chartreuse itself, but the 2005 documentary ''[[Into Great Silence]]'' gave unprecedented views of life within the hermitage.

Today, Carthusians live very much as they originally did, without any relaxing of their rules. Generally, those wishing to enter must be between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five.

In the 21st century, the Sélignac Charterhouse was converted into a house in which lay people could come and experience Carthusian retreats, living the Carthusian life for shorter periods (an eight-day retreat being fixed as the absolute minimum, in order to enter at least somewhat into the silent rhythm of the charterhouse).{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Before the [[Council of Trent]] in the 16th century, the Catholic Church in Western Europe had a wide variety of rituals for the celebration of Mass. Although the essentials were the same, there were variations in prayers and practices from region to region or among the various [[religious order]]s.

When [[Pope Pius V]] made the [[Roman Missal]] mandatory for all Catholics of the Latin Church, he permitted the continuance of other forms of celebrating Mass that had an antiquity of at least two centuries. The rite used by the Carthusians was one of these, and still continues in use in a version revised in 1981. Apart from the new elements in this revision, it is substantially the rite of Grenoble in the 12th century, with some admixture from other sources.&lt;ref name=Raymond&gt;{{Cite CE1913 | id = 03388a | title = The Carthusian Order | author =Douglas Raymund | accessdate = 2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to current Catholic legislation, priests can celebrate the traditional rites of their order without further authorization.

A feature unique to Carthusian liturgical practice is that the bishop bestows on Carthusian nuns, in the ceremony of their profession, a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and a [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]. This may be a vestigial remnant of ordination of [[deaconess]]es in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04651a.htm |title=Deaconesses}} in [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]; {{cite web |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/LITURGY/AROSEBY.TXT |title=A Rose By Any Other Name. The Ordination of Women to the Diaconate |first=David L |last=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nun is also invested with a crown and a ring. The nun wears these ornaments again only on the day of her monastic jubilee and on her [[bier]] after her death. At [[Matins]], if no priest or deacon is present, a nun assumes the stole and reads the Gospel; and although in the time of the [[Tridentine Mass]] the chanting of the Epistle was reserved to an ordained subdeacon, a consecrated nun sang the Epistle at the conventual Mass, though without wearing the maniple. For centuries Carthusian nuns retained this rite, administered by the diocesan bishop four years after the nun took her vows.&lt;ref name=Raymond/&gt;

== Formation ==
The formation of a Carthusian begins with 6 to 12 months of postulancy, where the postulant lives the life of a monk but without having professed any kind of vows. This is followed by 2 years of novitiate, where the novice wears a black cloak over the white Carthusian habit. Subsequently, the novice takes simple vows and becomes a junior professed for 3 years, during which the professed wears the full Carthusian habit. The simple vows may be renewed for another 2 years. Finally, the Carthusian performs a solemn profession and becomes a solemnly-professed Carthusian.&lt;ref name=&quot;voc&quot; /&gt;

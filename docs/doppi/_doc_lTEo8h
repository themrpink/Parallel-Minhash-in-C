==Geography==
[[File:Rennes de hermitage 2.JPG|thumb|right|Green Belt between Rennes and [[L'Hermitage]]]]
The ancient centre of the town is built on a hill, with the north side being more elevated than the south side. It is at the confluence of two rivers: the [[Ille]] and the [[Vilaine]].

Rennes is located on the [[Atlantic Europe|European atlantic arc]], 50&amp;nbsp;km from the [[English Channel]] (near [[Saint-Malo]], [[Dinard]] and [[Mont Saint-Michel]]).

Rennes has the distinction of having a significant [[Green Belt]] around its ring road. This Green Belt is a protected area between the city proper (rather dense) and the rest of its urban area (rather rural).

===Climate===

Rennes features an [[oceanic climate]]. Precipitation in Rennes is considerably less abundant than in the western parts of Brittany, reaching only half of the levels of, e.g., the city of [[Quimper]], which makes rainfall in Rennes comparable to the levels of larger parts of western Germany. Sunshine hours range between 1,700 and 1,850 annually, which is about the amount of sunshine received by the city of [[Lausanne]].

==Population==
In 2018, the inner population of the city was of 221,272 inhabitants, the Rennes intercommunal structure connecting Rennes with 42 nearby suburbs (named [[Rennes Métropole]]) counted 450,593 inhabitants and the metropolitan area counted over 720,000 inhabitants.

Rennes has [[Urban area (France)|the second fastest-growing metropolitan area in France]] after [[Toulouse]] and before [[Montpellier]], [[Bordeaux]] and [[Nantes]].

The inhabitants of Rennes are called ''Rennais'' in French.

==Sights==
Rennes is classified as a city of art and history.

===Historic centre===

The historic centre is located on the former plan of the ramparts. There is a difference between the northern city centre and the southern city centre due to the 1720 fire, which destroyed most of the timber framed houses in the northern part of the city. The rebuilding was done in stone, on a grid plan. The southern part, the poorest at this time, was not rebuilt.

Due to the presence of the ''parlement de Bretagne'', many &quot;[[hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]&quot; were built in the northern part, the richest in the 18th century. Most of the [[Monument historique|monuments historiques]] can be found there.

Colourful traditional [[half-timbered]] houses are situated primarily along the roads of Saint-Sauveur, Saint-Georges, de Saint-Malo, Saint-Guillaume, des Dames, du Chapitre, Vasselot, Saint-Michel, de la Psallette and around the plazas of Champ-Jacquet, des Lices, Saint-Anne and Rallier-du-Baty.

==== The Parlement de Bretagne and city hall area ====
The ''[[Parlement de Bretagne]]'' (Administrative and judicial centre of Brittany, {{Lang-br|Breujoù Breizh}}) is the most famous 17th century building in Rennes. It was rebuilt after a terrible fire in 1994 that may have been caused by a flare fired by a protester during a demonstration. It houses the Rennes [[Court of Appeal (France)|Court of Appeal]]. The plaza around is built on the [[classical architecture]].

On the west, the Place de la Mairie (City Hall Plaza, Plasenn Ti Kêr):
* City Hall
* Opera

On the east, at the end of the ''Rue Saint-Georges'' with traditional [[half-timbered]] houses: 
* 1920s Saint George Municipal Pool, with mosaics
* [[Saint George Palace]], and its garden

On the south-east:
* Saint-Germain square
** Saint-Germain Church
** Saint-Germain footbridge, 20th century wood and metal construction to link the plaza with Émile Zola Quay, across the [[Vilaine]] River.

[[Image:CimarronNovel.JPG|thumb|First edition ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Doran]]) ]]
'''''Cimarron''''' is a novel by [[Edna Ferber]], published in April [[1930 in literature|1930]] and based on development in Oklahoma after the Land Rush. The book was adapted into a critically acclaimed [[Cimarron (1931 film)|film]] of the same name, released in [[1931 in film|1931]] through [[RKO Pictures]]. The story was again adapted for the screen by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and was released in [[1960 in film|1960]], to meager success.

==Background==

===The Land Rush===
{{main article|Oklahoma Land Race}}
The [[Land Rush of 1889|Oklahoma Land Rush]] (also called the Oklahoma Land Race and [[Cherokee Strip]] [[Land Run]]) plays a pivotal role in both the novel and film adaptations. &quot;[[Manifest destiny]]&quot; and the desperation of the settlers involved in the rush provides the opening drama and sets the stage for the twists and turns in the book. Every settler is desperate to stake his claim on the best piece of land (near water).

[[Image:OkLandRush.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Photograph of the 1893 [[Oklahoma]] [[Oklahoma Land Race|Land Rush]], depicted in Ferber's book and films.]]

''Cimarron'' involves two land runs. [[Land Run of 1889|The first]], for the [[Unassigned Lands]], occurred on April 22, 1889. [[Land Run of 1893|The second]], for the Cherokee Outlet (commonly called the Cherokee Strip) occurred in 1893.  The piece of land in question had been allotted to the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] as part of the 1828 [[Treaty of New Echota]], while the rest of the [[Oklahoma Territory]] had been opened to settlers. As commerce grew across the area of [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]], cattlemen became increasingly annoyed by the presence of the [[Cherokee]] on prime land that they wanted to use to drive cattle from northern ranches to [[Texas]]. Some of this annoyance with the Native people can be attributed to the decision made by the Cherokees to side with the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]].  In the 1880s, the government attempted to lease the land for cattle ranching, but the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] refused. Eventually, the Cherokee people did sell the land to the government.

Throughout the remaining years of the 1880s various cattle associations and ranches fought over the land. Disputes even turned deadly, as large cattle companies and small ranchers both claimed the land as their own. This eventually led to a ban on cattle ranching in the area, and in 1893 the land, 58 miles (93&amp;nbsp;km) wide by 225 miles (362&amp;nbsp;km) long, was opened to homesteaders. The land was divided into 42,000 claims, and each [[Homestead Act|homesteader]] had to literally stake (put a stake with a white flag attached) their claim, and pick up a certificate back at the starting place. Nearly 100,000 people arrived for the rush, and over half of them would be sent back home after the day was through.

==The novel==
''Cimarron'' derives its name from the [[Cimarron Territory]]. The Cimarron Territory was an unrecognized name for the [[Oklahoma Panhandle|No Man's Land]], an unsettled area of the West and Midwest, especially lands once inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribes]] such as the [[Cherokee]] and [[Sioux]]. In 1886 the government declared such lands open to settlement. At the time of the novel's opening, [[Oklahoma]] is one such &quot;Cimarron Territory,&quot; though in actuality the historical setting of the novel is somewhere in the [[Cherokee Outlet]], also known as the [[Cherokee Strip]], and probably the city of [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]].

The novel is set in the Oklahoma of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It follows the lives of Yancey and Sabra Cravat, beginning with Yancey's tale of his participation in the [[Oklahoma Land Race|1893 land rush]]. They emigrate from [[Wichita, Kansas]], to the fictional town of Osage, Oklahoma with their son Cim and—unknowingly—a black boy named Isaiah. In Osage, the Cravats print their newspaper, the ''Oklahoma Wigwam'', and build their fortune amongst Indian disputes, outlaws, and the discovery of oil in [[Oklahoma]].

Upon its publication, ''Cimarron'' was a sensation in America and came to epitomize an era in [[American history]]. It was the best selling novel of 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kahnscorner.com/2013/06/1930-cimarron-by-edna-ferber.html|title=1930: Cimarron by Edna Ferber|last=Kahn|first=Matt|language=en|access-date=2019-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it provided readers an outlet to escape their present suffering in the [[Great Depression]]. This novel became Ferber's third successful novel and paved the way for many more Ferber-penned historical epics, and it was published as an [[Armed Services Edition]] during WWII.

While it became seen as a triumphant feminist story detailing Sabra Cravat's growth from a traditional American housewife into a successful leader and politician, Ferber has stated in her autobiography, ''[[A Peculiar Treasure]]'', that the novel was originally intended as a satirical criticism of American womanhood and American sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shapiro |first1=Ann R. |last2= |first2= |date=2002 |title=Edna Ferber, Jewish American Feminist |url= |journal=Shofar |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=52-60 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferber |first=Edna |date=1938 |title=A Peculiar Treasure |url= |location= |publisher=Doubleday, Doran, &amp; Co. |page=330 |isbn= |author-link= Edna Ferber }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the novel, Sabra's practice of imperial domesticity can be seen in her attempts to &quot;civilize&quot; Native Americans by forcing them to adopt white values, and her fixation on expanding her own sphere of influence, which as a woman, was traditionally her home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zink |first1=Amanda |last2= |first2= |date=2012 |title=Peyote in the Kitchen: Gendered Identities and Imperial Domesticity in Edna Ferber's Cimarron |url= |journal=Western American Literature |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=66-86 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Yancey Cravat is based on [[Temple Lea Houston]], last child of Texas icon [[Sam Houston]]. Temple Houston was a brilliant trial lawyer known for his flamboyant courtroom theatrics. He was also a competent gunfighter who killed at least one man in a stand-up shootout.

===The author===
{{main article|Edna Ferber}}
Born on August 15, 1885, in [[Michigan]], Ferber had lived through the latter development of the West. She grew up on the stories of her parents and grandparents, who had moved west from [[New York (state)|New York]] many years before her birth.

Her writing career began as a journalist, and Ferber published her first novel in 1911. Ferber's early works were mostly light romance. Her ''So Big'' (1924) brought Ferber more recognition as a novelist.  This novel about love and sacrifice in the Midwest earned Ferber a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. She immersed herself in writing historical epics, including ''[[Show Boat (novel)|Show Boat]]'', set on and around the [[Mississippi River]], and ''Cimarron'' in 1930.

==Films==

===1931 film===
{{main article|Cimarron (1931 film)}}

[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] had long since taken notice of writer Edna Ferber's talents. The first Ferber adaptation came in [[1918 in film|1918]] with the silent ''Our Mrs. McChesney'', based on a play Ferber had written. ''So Big'' was released as a film the same year it was published as a novel, and adaptations of ''Gigolo'' and ''Show Boat'' also followed. With the advent of sound, Ferber adaptations had even more promise. Immediately following its publication, many production companies courted Ferber. Ferber ended up selling the film rights to [[RKO Pictures]] in [[1930 in film|1930]] for a record $125,000 (a large sum even for today).

Despite America being in the depths of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], RKO immediately prepared for a big-budget picture, investing more than $1.5 million into Ferber's novel ''Cimarron''. Director [[Wesley Ruggles]] would direct stars [[Richard Dix (actor)|Richard Dix]] and [[Irene Dunne]] with a script written by [[Howard Estabrook]]. Filming began in the summer of 1930 at the [[Jasmin Quinn Ranch]] outside of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The film was a massive production, especially the land rush scenes, which recalled the epic scenes of ''[[Intolerance (movie)|Intolerance]]'' some fifteen years earlier. More than 5,000 extras, twenty-eight cameramen, and numerous camera assistants and photographers were used to capture scenes of wagons racing across grassy hills and prairies. Cinematographer [[Edward Cronjager]] spent overtime planning out every scene in accordance to Ferber's descriptions.

The film was premiered in [[New York City]] on January 26, 1931, to much praise, and a Los Angeles premiere followed on February 6. Three days later the film was released to theaters throughout the nation. Despite being a critical success, the high budget and ongoing Great Depression combined against the film. While it was a commercial success in line with other films of the day, RKO could not recoup their investment in the film.

===1960 film===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cimarron1960.jpg|110px|framed|right|Movie poster for 1960 film.]] --&gt;
{{main article|Cimarron (1960 film)}}

The remake of ''Cimarron'' included many changes from the Ferber novel and especially from the 1931 film. With the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gaining momentum, the script, written by [[Arnold Schulman]], took a kinder approach to Native Americans. Schulman gave the people more dignity and recognized that they were losing land that was rightfully theirs through the 1893 land rush that was the film's centerpiece. He also introduced several minor characters, such as journalist Sam Pegler ([[Robert Keith (actor)|Robert Keith]]) and Wes Jennings ([[Vic Morrow]]), a prominent member of Cherokee Kid's ([[Russ Tamblyn]]) gang.

In 1961 the film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color]] (art directors [[George Davis (art director)|George W. Davis]] and [[Addison Hehr]]) and [[Academy Award for Sound|Best Sound]], but failed to win either. ''Cimarron'' marked the end of the Ferber adaptations.

{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2015}}
The '''Halloween documents''' comprise a series of confidential [[Microsoft]] memoranda on potential strategies relating to [[free software]], [[open-source software]], and to [[Linux]] in particular, and a series of media responses to these memoranda. Both the leaked documents and the responses were published by [[Eric S. Raymond]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Harmon |first=Amy |date=1998-11-03 |title=Internal Memo Shows Microsoft Executives' Concern Over Free Software |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/11/biztech/articles/03memo.html |url-status=live |access-date=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents are associated with [[Halloween]] because many of them were originally leaked close to October 31 in different years.

==Overview==
The first Halloween document, requested by senior vice-president [[Jim Allchin]] for the attention of senior vice-president [[Paul Maritz]] and written by Microsoft program manager Vinod Valloppillil, was leaked to [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]] in October 1998, who immediately published an annotated version on his web site. The document contained references to a second memorandum specifically dealing with [[Linux]], and that document, authored by Vinod Valloppillil and Josh Cohen at Microsoft, was also obtained, annotated and published by Raymond. Microsoft has since acknowledged the documents' authenticity.&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxresp&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |date=1998-11-05 |title=Microsoft Responds to the Open Source Memo Regarding the Open Source Model and Linux |url=http://www.microsoft.com/NTServer/nts/news/mwarv/linuxresp.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991013112307/http://microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/news/mwarv/linuxresp.asp |archive-date=1999-10-13 |access-date=2012-06-02 |website=Windows NT Server 4.0 website |publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marked &quot;Microsoft confidential&quot;, the documents identified open-source software, and in particular the Linux operating system, as a major threat to Microsoft's domination of the software industry,&lt;ref name=&quot;HW_1Q7&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Halloween Document 1 |url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/halloween1.html#quote7 |access-date=2016-02-22 |website=www.catb.org |at=Quote 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested tactics Microsoft could use to disrupt the progress of open-source software.

These documents acknowledged that [[free software]] products such as Linux were technologically competitive with some of Microsoft's products,&lt;ref name=&quot;HW_1Q5&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Halloween Document 1 |url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/halloween1.html#quote5 |access-date=2016-02-22 |website=www.catb.org |at=Quote 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and set out a strategy to combat them. These views contradicted Microsoft's public pronouncements on the subject.

Since the publication of the two original documents, a number of additional Microsoft memoranda on related topics have also been leaked and published.

==List of documents==
The documents are from a variety of sources. Only some are leaked internal memos (documents I, II, VII, VIII, and X). One is a public statement (document III). The others are responses by Eric Raymond to various columns, news articles, and other works.

===Documents I and II===
These are leaked reports for Microsoft's own use, both written by Vinod Valloppillil, a program manager at Microsoft.

Document I provides a detailed introduction to the concepts behind open source software and its possible impact on Microsoft products and services. It outlines the strengths and weaknesses of open source software. Document II describes the basic architecture of the Linux system, and its relation to Unix and Windows NT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Open Source Initiative: Halloween Document 1 |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/fsfe/projects/ms-vs-eu/halloween1.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191013022358/https://www.gnu.org/software/fsfe/projects/ms-vs-eu/halloween1.html |archive-date=2019-10-13 |access-date=2020-10-03 |website=www.gnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Open Source Initiative: Halloween Document 2 |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/fsfe/projects/ms-vs-eu/halloween2.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128171030/https://www.gnu.org/software/fsfe/projects/ms-vs-eu/halloween2.html |archive-date=2020-01-28 |access-date=2020-10-03 |website=www.gnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Document I revealed that &quot;FUD&quot; (spreading [[fear, uncertainty, and doubt]]) was a traditional Microsoft marketing strategy, acknowledged and understood internally.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot; /&gt; Examples of Microsoft's FUD tactics are [[Vaporware|announcing nonexistent products]] or spreading rumors that competing products will crash Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author-link=Scott Rosenberg (journalist) |date=1998-11-04 |title=Let's Get This Straight: Microsoft's Halloween scare |work=Salon |publisher=[[Salon Media Group]] |url=http://www.salon.com/1998/11/04/straight_39/ |url-status=live |access-date=2012-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112092006/http://www.salon.com/1998/11/04/straight_39/ |archive-date=2013-11-12 |author-first=Scott |author-last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond suggests that the documents show that while Microsoft may have been dismissive of open source software in public, it privately considers it a serious competitor.

In discussing ways of competing with open source, Document I suggests that one reason that open source projects had been able to enter the [[webserver|server]] market is the market's use of standardized protocols. The document then suggests that this can be stopped by &quot;extending these protocols and developing new protocols&quot; and &quot;de-commoditiz[ing] protocols &amp; applications&quot;. This policy has been internally nicknamed &quot;[[embrace, extend, extinguish]]&quot;. Document I also suggests that open source software &quot;is long-term credible ... FUD tactics can not be used to combat it&quot;, and &quot;Recent case studies (the Internet) provide very dramatic evidence ... that commercial quality can be achieved / exceeded by OSS projects.&quot;

Documents I and II were filed as evidence on January 16, 2007, in the case of ''[[Comes v. Microsoft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-01-16 |title=Plaintiff's Exhibit 6501 |url=http://iowa.gotthefacts.org/011607/6000/PX06501.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107034843/http://iowa.gotthefacts.org/011607/6000/PX06501.pdf |archive-date=2007-11-07 |access-date=2012-06-02 |website=Exhibits Offered by Plaintiffs on 1.11.07 and Admitted by the Court on 1.16.07 |publisher=iowa.gotthefacts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Document III===
The statement from Aurelia van den Berg, the Press and Public Relations manager of Microsoft Netherlands, puts forward Microsoft's view on the first two documents. It says that the documents are not an &quot;official position&quot;, but that &quot;it is routine and appropriate&quot; to research competitors. This statement is only a brief response, but many points were later incorporated into an official response from Microsoft.&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxresp&quot; /&gt;

===Document VII===
This document is a summary of the results of a survey of developers and IT managers, carried out by Microsoft, describing reactions to Microsoft's [[shared source|shared-source]] program. Eric Raymond provides commentary suggesting ways that the open-source community can promote itself based on the results of the survey. The results show favorable responses about both open-source and shared-source principles. It also describes low [[total cost of ownership]] as a major reason for Linux adoption, in contradiction to many documents released by the company suggesting that Windows has a lower [[Total cost of ownership|TCO]] than Linux solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Get the Facts: Total Cost of Ownership |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/0/6/a0628eee-0114-4444-9793-e52a92dc4cf4/getthefacts_execsummary_tco.doc |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411041813/http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/0/6/a0628eee-0114-4444-9793-e52a92dc4cf4/GetTheFacts_ExecSummary_TCO.DOC |archive-date=2007-04-11 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Windows 2000 Versus Linux in Enterprise Computing |url=http://download.microsoft.com/documents/uk/technet/opex/downloads/Windows_2000_v_Linux_Enterprise_Computing.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623193912/http://download.microsoft.com/documents/uk/technet/opex/downloads/Windows_2000_v_Linux_Enterprise_Computing.pdf |archive-date=2013-06-23 |publisher=[[International Data Corporation|IDC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Galli |first=Peter |date=2002-12-02 |title=Study Finds Windows Cheaper Than Linux |url=https://www.eweek.com/servers/study-finds-windows-cheaper-than-linux |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.vn/zcdKp |archive-date=2020-11-12 |access-date=2020-11-12 |website=[[eWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Document VIII===
&quot;OSS and Government&quot;, aka &quot;'''Halloween VIII: Doing the Damage-Control Dance'''&quot;, is a memo from Group Vice President of Worldwide Sales, Orlando Ayala, to general managers of Microsoft regional subsidiaries. It describes the availability of support from Microsoft corporate for regional sales personnel facing competition from Linux in government markets.

===Document X===
An e-mail from consultant Mike Anderer to [[SCO Group]]'s Chris Sontag, also known as &quot;'''Halloween X: Follow The Money'''&quot;. The document describes, among other points, Microsoft's channeling of $86&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|86|2004}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) to SCO.

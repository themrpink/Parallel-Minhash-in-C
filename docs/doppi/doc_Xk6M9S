German foreign policy under Wilhelm II was faced with a number of significant problems. Perhaps the most apparent was that Wilhelm was an impatient man, subjective in his reactions and affected strongly by sentiment and impulse.  He was personally ill-equipped to steer German foreign policy along a rational course. It is now widely recognised that the various spectacular acts which Wilhelm undertook in the international sphere were often partially encouraged by the German foreign policy elite.{{according to whom|date=February 2019}} There were a number of notorious examples, such as the [[Kruger telegram]] of 1896 in which Wilhelm congratulated President [[Paul Kruger]] of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal Republic]] on the suppression of the British [[Jameson Raid]], thus alienating British public opinion.

British public opinion had been quite favourable towards the Kaiser in his first twelve years on the throne, but it turned sour in the late 1890s. During the [[World War I|First World War]], he became the central target of British anti-German propaganda and the personification of a hated enemy.{{Sfn | Reinermann | 2008 | pp = 469–85}}

Wilhelm invented and spread fears of a [[yellow peril]] trying to interest other European rulers in the perils they faced by invading China; few other leaders paid attention.{{Sfn|Röhl|1996|p=203}}  Wilhelm used the Japanese victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] to try to incite fear in the west of the yellow peril that they faced by a resurgent Japan, which Wilhelm claimed would ally with China to overrun the west. Under Wilhelm, Germany invested in strengthening its colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but few became profitable and all were lost during the First World War. In [[German South West Africa|South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]), a native revolt against German rule led to the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]], although Wilhelm eventually ordered it to be stopped.

One of the few times when Wilhelm succeeded in personal diplomacy was when in 1900 he supported the marriage of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] to [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Countess Sophie Chotek]], against the wishes of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].{{Sfn | Cecil | 1989 | p = 14}}

A domestic triumph for Wilhelm was when his daughter [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|Victoria Louise]] married the [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Duke of Brunswick]] in 1913; this helped heal the rift between the [[House of Hanover]] and the [[House of Hohenzollern]] that had followed the annexation of Hanover by Prussia in 1866.{{Sfn | Cecil | 1989 | pp = 9}}

===Political visits to the Ottoman Empire===
[[File:Wilhelm_Decorated_Streets.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm in [[Jerusalem]] during his state visit to the Ottoman Empire, 1898]]
In his first visit to [[Istanbul]] in 1889, Wilhelm secured the sale of German-made rifles to the Ottoman Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;istanbulnet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istanbul.net.tr/istanbul_eski_eserler_detay.asp?id=135 |title=Alman Çeşmesi |accessdate=16 September 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210356/http://www.istanbul.net.tr/istanbul_eski_eserler_detay.asp?id=135 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, he had his second political visit to the [[Ottoman Empire]] as a guest of Sultan [[Abdülhamid II]]. The Kaiser started his journey to the Ottoman [[Eyalet]]s with Istanbul on 16 October 1898; then he went by yacht to [[Haifa]] on 25 October. After visiting [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]], the Kaiser went back to [[Jaffa]] to embark to [[Beirut]], where he took the train passing [[Aley]] and [[Zahlé]] to reach [[Damascus]] on 7 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emperor's visit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abdelraoufsinno.com/periodicals/docum_41.pdf|title=The Emperor's visit to the East: As reflected in contemporary Arabic journalism|author=Abdel-Raouf Sinno|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting the [[Mausoleum of Saladin]] the following day, the Kaiser made a speech:

{{quote|text=In the face of all the courtesies extended to us here, I feel that I must thank you, in my name as well as that of the Empress, for them, for the hearty reception given us in all the towns and cities we have touched, and particularly for the splendid welcome extended to us by this city of Damascus. Deeply moved by this imposing spectacle, and likewise by the consciousness of standing on the spot where held sway one of the most chivalrous rulers of all times, the great Sultan Saladin, a knight sans peur et sans reproche, who often taught his adversaries the right conception of knighthood, I seize with joy the opportunity to render thanks, above all to the Sultan Abdul Hamid for his hospitality. May the Sultan rest assured, and also the three hundred million Mohammedans scattered over the globe and revering in him their caliph, that the German Emperor will be and remain at all times their friend.|author=Kaiser Wilhelm II|source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wolf von Schierbrand |authorlink1=Wolf Curt von Schierbrand |author2=A.

On 10 November, Wilhelm went to visit [[Baalbek]] before heading to Beirut to board his ship back home on 12 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emperor's visit&quot;/&gt; In his second visit, Wilhelm secured a promise for German companies to construct the [[Berlin–Baghdad railway]],&lt;ref name=&quot;istanbulnet&quot;/&gt; and had the [[German Fountain]] constructed in Istanbul to commemorate his journey.

His third visit was on 15 October 1917, as the guest of Sultan [[Mehmed V]].

===Hun speech of 1900===
The [[Boxer rebellion]], an anti-western uprising in China, was put down in 1900 by an international force of British, French, Russian, Austrian, Italian, American, Japanese, and German troops. The Germans, however, forfeited any prestige that they might have gained for their participation by arriving only after the British and Japanese forces had taken [[Beijing|Peking]], the site of the fiercest fighting. Moreover, the poor impression left by the German troops' late arrival was made worse by the Kaiser's ill-conceived farewell address, in which he commanded them, in the spirit of the [[Huns]], to be merciless in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;HunSpeechII&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Hun Speech&quot;: Kaiser Wilhelm II's Address to the German Expeditionary Force Prior to its Departure for China (July 27, 1900)|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=2178|publisher=German History in Documents and Images|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm delivered this speech in [[Bremerhaven]] on 27 July 1900, addressing German troops who were departing to suppress the Boxer rebellion in China. The speech was infused with Wilhelm's fiery and chauvinistic rhetoric and clearly expressed his vision of German imperial power. There were two versions of the speech. The Foreign Office issued an edited version, making sure to omit one particularly incendiary paragraph that they regarded as diplomatically embarrassing.&lt;ref name=&quot;HunSpeech&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunlap|first=Thorsten|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=755&amp;language=english|title=Wilhelm II: &quot;Hun Speech&quot; (1900)|publisher=German History in Documents and Images|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edited version was this:

{{quote|Great overseas tasks have fallen to the new German Empire, tasks far greater than many of my countrymen expected. The German Empire has, by its very character, the obligation to assist its citizens if they are being set upon in foreign lands. The tasks that the old [[Holy Roman Empire|Roman Empire of the German nation]] was unable to accomplish, the new German Empire is in a position to fulfill. The means that make this possible is our army.

It has been built up during thirty years of faithful, peaceful labor, following the principles of my blessed grandfather. You, too, have received your training in accordance with these principles, and by putting them to the test before the enemy, you should see whether they have proved their worth in you. Your comrades in the navy have already passed this test; they have shown that the principles of your training are sound, and I am also proud of the praise that your comrades have earned over there from foreign leaders. It is up to you to emulate them.

A great task awaits you: you are to revenge the grievous injustice that has been done. The Chinese have overturned the law of nations; they have mocked the sacredness of the envoy, the duties of hospitality in a way unheard of in world history. It is all the more outrageous that this crime has been committed by a nation that takes pride in its ancient culture. Show the old Prussian virtue. Present yourselves as Christians in the cheerful endurance of suffering. May honor and glory follow your banners and arms. Give the whole world an example of manliness and discipline.

You know full well that you are to fight against a cunning, brave, well-armed, and cruel enemy. When you encounter him, know this: no quarter will be given. Prisoners will not be taken. Exercise your arms such that for a thousand years no Chinese will dare to look cross-eyed at a German. Maintain discipline. May God’s blessing be with you, the prayers of an entire nation and my good wishes go with you, each and every one. Open the way to civilization once and for all! Now you may depart! Farewell, comrades!&lt;ref name=&quot;HunSpeech&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Prenzle|first=Johannes|title=Die Reden Kaiser Wilhelms II|location=Leipzig|pages=209–212|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The official version omitted the following passage from which the speech derives its name:

{{quote|Should you encounter the enemy, he will be defeated! No quarter will be given! Prisoners will not be taken! Whoever falls into your hands is forfeited. Just as a thousand years ago the [[Huns]] under their King [[Attila]] made a name for themselves, one that even today makes them seem mighty in history and legend, may the name German be affirmed by you in such a way in China that no Chinese will ever again dare to look cross-eyed at a German.&lt;ref name=&quot;HunSpeech&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Görtemaker|first=Manfred|title=Deutschland im 19.

The term &quot;Hun&quot; later became the favoured epithet of Allied anti-German war propaganda during the First World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;HunSpeechII&quot; /&gt;

===Eulenberg Scandal===
In the years 1906–09, a succession of homosexual revelations, trials, and suicides involving ministers, courtiers, and Wilhelm's closest friend and advisor,{{sfn|Massie|1991|pp=673-679}} Prince [[Philipp, Prince zu Eulenburg|Philipp zu Eulenberg]], evolved into the most tumultuous ''cause célèbre'' of its era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steakley&quot;&gt;Steakley, James D. ''Iconography of a Scandal: Political Cartoons and the Eulenburg Affair in Wilhelmine Germany.'' in ''Hidden From History:Reclaiming The Gay And Lesbian Past'' Dubermann, Martin (Ed.), New American Library, 1989,pp325-326&lt;/ref&gt; Fuelled by the journalist [[Maximilian Harden]], who, like some in the upper echelons of the military and Foreign Office, resented Eulenberg's approval of the [[Entente Cordiale|Anglo-French Entente]], and also his encouragement of Wilhelm to personally rule, it led to Wilhelm suffering a nervous breakdown, and the removal of Eulenberg and others of his circle from the court.{{sfn|Massie|1991|pp=673-679}} The view that Wilhelm was a deeply repressed homosexual is increasingly supported by scholars: certainly, he never came to terms with his feelings for Eulenberg.{{sfn|Röhl|1982|p=48}} Historians have linked the [[Harden–Eulenburg affair|Harden-Eulenberg affair]] to a fundamental shift in German policy that heightened military aggression and ultimately contributed to the First World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steakley&quot; /&gt;

===Moroccan Crisis===
One of Wilhelm's diplomatic blunders sparked the [[First Moroccan Crisis|Moroccan Crisis]] of 1905, when he made a spectacular visit to [[Tangier]], in Morocco on 31 March 1905. He conferred with representatives of Sultan [[Abdelaziz of Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Morocco|volume=18|page=858}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaiser proceeded to tour the city on the back of a white horse. The Kaiser declared he had come to support the sovereignty of the Sultan—a statement which amounted to a provocative challenge to French influence in Morocco. The Sultan subsequently rejected a set of French-proposed governmental reforms and issued invitations to major world powers to a [[Algeciras Conference|conference]] which would advise him on necessary reforms.

The Kaiser's presence was seen as an assertion of German interests in Morocco, in opposition to those of France. In his speech, he even made remarks in favour of Moroccan independence, and this led to friction with France, which had expanding colonial interests in Morocco, and to the [[Algeciras Conference]], which served largely to further isolate Germany in Europe.{{Sfn | Cecil | 1989 | pp = 91–102}}

===''Daily Telegraph'' affair===
{{main|Daily Telegraph Affair}}
[[File:Churchill und Wilhelm II. (1906).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Wilhelm and [[Winston Churchill]] during a military autumn manoeuvre near [[Breslau]], [[Silesia]] ([[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]) in 1906]]

Wilhelm's most damaging personal blunder cost him much of his prestige and power and had a far greater impact in Germany than overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John C. G. Röhl|title=Wilhelm II: Into the Abyss of War and Exile, 1900–1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FN9GAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA662|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=662–95|isbn=9781107728967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' Affair of 1908 involved the publication in Germany of an interview with a British daily newspaper that included wild statements and diplomatically damaging remarks. Wilhelm had seen the interview as an opportunity to promote his views and ideas on Anglo-German friendship, but due to his emotional outbursts during the course of the interview, he ended up further alienating not only the British, but also the French, Russians, and Japanese. He implied, among other things, that the Germans cared nothing for the British; that the French and Russians had attempted to incite Germany to intervene in the [[Second Boer War]]; and that the German naval buildup was targeted against the Japanese, not Britain. One memorable quotation from the interview was, &quot;You English are mad, mad, [[Mad as a March hare|mad as March hares]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Daily_Telegraph_Affair|title=The Daily Telegraph Affair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect in Germany was quite significant, with serious calls for his abdication. Wilhelm kept a very low profile for many months after the ''Daily Telegraph'' fiasco, but later exacted his revenge by forcing the resignation of the chancellor, Prince Bülow, who had abandoned the Emperor to public scorn by not having the transcript edited before its German publication.{{Sfn | Cecil | 1989 | pp=135–7, 143–45}}&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Shepardson, &quot;The 'Daily Telegraph' Affair,&quot; ''Midwest Quarterly'' (1980) 21#2 pp 207–220&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Daily Telegraph'' crisis deeply wounded Wilhelm's previously unimpaired self-confidence, and he soon suffered a severe bout of depression from which he never fully recovered. He lost much of the influence he had previously exercised in domestic and foreign policy.{{Sfn | Cecil | 1989 |pp=138–41}}

===Naval expansion===
[[File:Gulbransson cartoon 1909.jpg|thumb|Caricature by Olaf Gulbransson 1909: &quot;Manoeuvre: Emperor William II explains the enemy's positions to Prince [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig of Bavaria]]&quot;]]

Nothing Wilhelm did in the international arena was of more influence than his decision to pursue a policy of massive naval construction. A powerful navy was Wilhelm's pet project. He had inherited from his mother a love of the British [[Royal Navy]], which was at that time the world's largest. He once confided to his uncle, the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]], that his dream was to have a &quot;fleet of my own some day&quot;. Wilhelm's frustration over his fleet's poor showing at the [[Fleet Review, Royal Navy#Queen Victoria|Fleet Review]] at his grandmother [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]] celebrations, combined with his inability to exert German influence in South Africa following the dispatch of the [[Kruger telegram]], led to Wilhelm taking definitive steps toward the construction of a fleet to rival that of his British cousins. Wilhelm was fortunate to be able to call on the services of the dynamic naval officer [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], whom he appointed to the head of the Imperial Naval Office in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Carl L. Boyd, &quot;The Wasted Ten Years, 1888–1898: The Kaiser Finds an Admiral.&quot; ''Royal United Services Institution. Journal'' 111.644 (1966): 291-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new admiral had conceived of what came to be known as the &quot;Risk Theory&quot; or the [[Tirpitz Plan]], by which Germany could force Britain to accede to German demands in the international arena through the threat posed by a powerful battlefleet concentrated in the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Steinberg, &quot;The Tirpitz Plan.&quot; ''Historical Journal'' 16.1 (1973): 196-204. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637924 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Tirpitz enjoyed Wilhelm's full support in his advocacy of successive naval bills of 1897 and 1900, by which the German navy was built up to contend with that of the British Empire. Naval expansion under the [[Fleet Acts]] eventually led to severe financial strains in Germany by 1914, as by 1906 Wilhelm had committed his navy to construction of the much larger, more expensive [[dreadnought]] type of battleship.{{sfn|Cecil|1989|pp=152-73}}

In 1889 Wilhelm reorganised top level control of the navy by creating a [[German Imperial Naval Cabinet|Naval Cabinet]] (''Marine-Kabinett'') equivalent to the [[German Imperial Military Cabinet]] which had previously functioned in the same capacity for both the army and navy. The Head of the Naval Cabinet was responsible for promotions, appointments, administration, and issuing orders to naval forces. Captain [[Gustav von Senden-Bibran]] was appointed as the first head and remained so until 1906. The existing Imperial admiralty was abolished, and its responsibilities divided between two organisations.  A new position was created, equivalent to the supreme commander of the army: the Chief of the High Command of the Admiralty, or ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'', was responsible for ship deployments, strategy and tactics.  Vice-Admiral [[Max von der Goltz]] was appointed in 1889 and remained in post until 1895.  Construction and maintenance of ships and obtaining supplies was the responsibility of the State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office ([[Reichsmarineamt]]), responsible to the Imperial Chancellor and advising the ''Reichstag'' on naval matters. The first appointee was [[Karl Eduard Heusner|Rear Admiral Karl Eduard Heusner]], followed shortly by Rear Admiral [[Friedrich von Hollmann]] from 1890 to 1897.  Each of these three heads of department reported separately to Wilhelm.{{Sfn | Herwig | 1980 | pp = 21–23}}

In addition to the expansion of the fleet, the [[Kiel Canal]] was opened in 1895, enabling faster movements between the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]].

==World War I==
{{Further|German entry into World War I}}
Historians typically argue that Wilhelm was largely confined to ceremonial duties during the war—there were innumerable parades to review and honours to award.  &quot;The man who in peace had believed himself omnipotent became in war a 'shadow Kaiser', out of sight, neglected, and relegated to the sidelines.&quot;{{sfn|Cecil|1989| p=212}}

===The Sarajevo crisis===
[[File:Kaiserparade 1909 Karlsruhe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Wilhelm with the Grand Duke of Baden, Prince Oskar of Prussia, the Grand Duke of Hesse, the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Prince Louis of Bavaria, Prince Max of Baden and his son, Crown Prince Wilhelm, at pre-war military manoeuvres in autumn 1909]]
[[File:Kaiser generals.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A composite image of Wilhelm with German generals]]

Wilhelm was a friend of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], and he was deeply shocked by his assassination on 28 June 1914. Wilhelm offered to support Austria-Hungary in crushing the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]], the secret organisation that had plotted the killing, and even sanctioned the use of force by Austria against the perceived source of the movement—[[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] (this is often called &quot;the blank cheque&quot;). He wanted to remain in Berlin until the crisis was resolved, but his courtiers persuaded him instead to go on his annual cruise of the North Sea on 6 July 1914. Wilhelm made erratic attempts to stay on top of the crisis via telegram, and when the [[July Crisis|Austro-Hungarian ultimatum]] was delivered to Serbia, he hurried back to Berlin. He reached Berlin on 28 July, read a copy of the Serbian reply, and wrote on it:

{{quote|A brilliant solution—and in barely 48 hours! This is more than could have been expected. A great moral victory for Vienna; but with it every pretext for war falls to the ground, and [the Ambassador] Giesl had better have stayed quietly at Belgrade. On this document, I should never have given orders for mobilisation.{{Sfn | Ludwig | 1927 | p = 444}}}}

Unknown to the Emperor, Austro-Hungarian ministers and generals had already convinced the 83-year-old [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] to sign a declaration of war against Serbia. As a direct consequence, Russia began a [[general mobilisation]] to attack Austria in defence of Serbia.

===July 1914{{anchor|30 July 1914}}===
{{Main|July Crisis}}
[[File:General Hans G. von Plessen.jpg|thumb|left|Wilhelm conversing with the victor of [[Battle of Liège|Liège]], General [[Otto von Emmich]]; in the background the generals [[Hans von Plessen]] (middle) and [[Moriz von Lyncker]] (right)]]

On the night of 30 July, when handed a document stating that Russia would not cancel its mobilisation, Wilhelm wrote a lengthy commentary containing these observations:{{quote|... For I no longer have any doubt that England, Russia and France have agreed among themselves—knowing that our treaty obligations compel us to support Austria—to use the Austro-Serb conflict as a pretext for waging a war of annihilation against us ... Our dilemma over keeping faith with the old and honourable Emperor has been exploited to create a situation which gives England the excuse she has been seeking to annihilate us with a spurious appearance of justice on the pretext that she is helping France and maintaining the well-known Balance of Power in Europe, ''i.e.'', playing off all European States for her own benefit against us.{{Sfn | Balfour | 1964 | pp = 350–51}}}}

More recent British authors state that Wilhelm II really declared, &quot;Ruthlessness and weakness will start the most terrifying war of the world, whose purpose is to destroy Germany. Because there can no longer be any doubts, England, France and Russia have conspired themselves together to fight an annihilation war against us&quot;.{{Sfn | Willmott | 2003 | p = 11}}

{{listen|filename=Wilhelm II 6-8-1914.ogg|title=An das deutsche Volk|description= Extract from Wilhelm's public address for mobilisation, 6 August 1914. |format=[[ogg]]}}

When it became clear that Germany would experience a war on two fronts and that Britain would enter the war if Germany attacked France through neutral [[Belgium]], the panic-stricken Wilhelm attempted to redirect the main attack against Russia. When [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|Helmuth von Moltke (the younger)]] (who had chosen the old plan from 1905, made by General [[von Schlieffen]] for the possibility of German war on two fronts) told him that this was impossible, Wilhelm said: &quot;Your [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|uncle]] would have given me a different answer!&quot;{{Sfn | Ludwig | 1927 | p = 453}}  Wilhelm is also reported to have said, &quot;To think that [[George V|George]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicky]] should have played me false! If my [[Queen Victoria|grandmother]] had been alive, she would never have allowed it.&quot;{{Sfn | Balfour | 1964 | p = 355}}  In the original [[Schlieffen plan]], Germany would attack the (supposed) weaker enemy first, meaning France.  The plan supposed that it would take a long time before Russia was ready for war. Defeating France had been easy for Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. At the 1914 border between France and Germany, an attack at this more southern part of France could be stopped by the French fortress along the border. However, Wilhelm II stopped any invasion of the Netherlands.

===Shadow-Kaiser===

[[File:Hindenburg, Kaiser, Ludendorff HD-SN-99-02150.JPG|left|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]], Wilhelm, and [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] in January 1917]]

Wilhelm's role in wartime was one of ever-decreasing power as he increasingly handled awards ceremonies and honorific duties.  The high command continued with its strategy even when it was clear that the [[Schlieffen plan]] had failed. By 1916 the Empire had effectively become a military dictatorship under the control of Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and General [[Erich Ludendorff]].{{Sfn | Craig|1978| pp = 374, 377–78, 393}}  Increasingly cut off from reality and the political decision-making process, Wilhelm vacillated between defeatism and dreams of victory, depending upon the fortunes of his armies.  Nevertheless, Wilhelm still retained the ultimate authority in matters of political appointment, and it was only after his consent had been gained that major changes to the high command could be effected. Wilhelm was in favour of the dismissal of Helmuth von Moltke the Younger in September 1914 and his replacement by [[Erich von Falkenhayn]]. In 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided that Bethman-Hollweg was no longer acceptable to them as Chancellor and called upon the Kaiser to appoint somebody else. When asked whom they would accept, Ludendorff recommended [[Georg Michaelis]], a nonentity whom he barely knew. Despite this, he accepted the suggestion. Upon hearing in July 1917 that his cousin George V had changed the name of the British royal house to [[House of Windsor|Windsor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30186|page=7119|date=17 July 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm remarked that he planned to see [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor|The Merry Wives of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]]''.{{sfn|Carter|2010| p=xxiii }} The Kaiser's support collapsed completely in October–November 1918 in the army, in the civilian government, and in German public opinion, as President [[Woodrow Wilson]] made clear that the Kaiser could no longer be a party to peace negotiations.{{Sfn | Cecil | 1989 | p = 283}}{{Sfn | Schwabe | 1985 | p = 107}} That year also saw Wilhelm sickened during the worldwide [[1918 flu pandemic]], though he survived.{{Sfn | Collier | 1974}}

==Abdication and flight==
{{Main|Abdication of Wilhelm II}}

{{wikisource|Statement of Abdication}}
Wilhelm was at the Imperial Army headquarters in [[Spa, Belgium]], when the uprisings in Berlin and other centres took him by surprise in late 1918. [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|Mutiny]] among the ranks of his beloved [[Kaiserliche Marine]], the imperial navy, profoundly shocked him. After the outbreak of the [[German Revolution]], Wilhelm could not make up his mind whether or not to abdicate.  Up to that point, he accepted that he would likely have to give up the imperial crown, but still hoped to retain the Prussian kingship. However, this was impossible under the imperial constitution. Wilhelm thought he ruled as emperor in a [[personal union]] with Prussia. In truth, the constitution defined the empire as a confederation of states under the permanent presidency of Prussia. The imperial crown was thus tied to the Prussian crown, meaning that Wilhelm could not renounce one crown without renouncing the other.

Wilhelm's hope of retaining at least one of his crowns was revealed as unrealistic when, in the hope of preserving the monarchy in the face of growing revolutionary unrest, Chancellor [[Prince Max of Baden]] announced Wilhelm's abdication of both titles on 9 November 1918.  Prince Max himself was forced to resign later the same day, when it became clear that only [[Friedrich Ebert]], leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], could effectively exert control.  Later that day, one of Ebert's secretaries of state (ministers), Social Democrat [[Philipp Scheidemann]], proclaimed Germany [[Weimar Republic|a republic]].

Wilhelm consented to the abdication only after Ludendorff's replacement, General [[Wilhelm Groener]], had informed him that the officers and men of the army would march back in good order under [[Paul von Hindenburg]]'s command, but would certainly not fight for Wilhelm's throne on the home front. The monarchy's last and strongest support had been broken, and finally even Hindenburg, himself a lifelong [[monarchist|royalist]], was obliged, with some embarrassment, to advise the Emperor to give up the crown.{{Sfn | Cecil | 1989 | p=292}}

The fact that the High Command might one day abandon the Kaiser had been foreseen in December 1897, when Wilhelm had visited [[Otto von Bismarck]] for the last time. Bismarck had again warned the Kaiser about the increasing influence of militarists, especially of the admirals who were pushing for the construction of a battle fleet. Bismarck's last warning had been:

{{quote|Your Majesty, so long as you have this present officer corps, you can do as you please. But when this is no longer the case, it will be very different for you.{{Sfn | Palmer | 1976 | p = 267}}}}

Subsequently, Bismarck had predicted accurately:

{{quote|[[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena]] came twenty years after the death of [[Frederick the Great]]; the crash will come twenty years after my departure if things go on like this.{{Sfn | Taylor | 1967 | p = 264}}}}

On 10 November, Wilhelm crossed the border by train and went into exile in the Netherlands, which had remained neutral throughout the war.{{Sfn | Cecil | 1989 | p=294}}  Upon the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in early 1919, Article 227 expressly provided for the prosecution of Wilhelm &quot;for a supreme offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties&quot;, but the Dutch government refused to extradite him, despite appeals from the Allies. [[King George V]] wrote that he looked on his cousin as &quot;the greatest criminal in history&quot;, but opposed Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]]'s proposal to &quot;hang the Kaiser&quot;.

It was reported, however, that there was little zeal in Britain to prosecute. On 1 January 1920, it was stated in official circles in London that Great Britain would “welcome refusal by Holland to deliver the former kaiser for trial,” and it was hinted that this had been conveyed to the Dutch government through diplomatic channels.

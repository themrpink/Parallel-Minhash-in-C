==Monastic reformer==
Over time, Teresa found herself increasingly at odds with the spiritual malaise prevailing in her convent of the Incarnation. Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of [[cloister]], designed to protect and strengthen spiritual practice and prayer, became so lax that it appeared to lose its purpose. The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, disturbed the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vacuous conversation. Such intrusions in the solitude essential to develop and sustain contemplative prayer so grieved Teresa that she longed to intervene.&lt;ref name=ocd.pcn.net /&gt;

The incentive to take the practical steps inspired by her inward motivation was supported by the [[Franciscan]] priest, [[Peter of Alcantara]], who met her early in 1560 and became her [[Spiritual direction|spiritual adviser]]. She resolved to found a &quot;reformed&quot; Carmelite convent, correcting the laxity which she had found at the Incarnation convent and elsewhere besides. Guimara de Ulloa, a woman of wealth and a friend, supplied the funds for the project.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

The abject poverty of the new convent, established in 1562 and named [[Convento de San José (Ávila)|St. Joseph's (San José)]], at first caused a scandal among the citizens and authorities of Ávila, and the small house with its chapel was in peril of suppression. However, powerful patrons, including the local bishop, coupled with the impression of well ordered subsistence and purpose, turned animosity into approval.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

In March 1563, after Teresa had moved to the new convent house, she received [[Papal decree|papal sanction]] for her primary principles of absolute poverty and renunciation of ownership of property, which she proceeded to formulate into a &quot;constitution&quot;. Her plan was the revival of the earlier, stricter monastic rules, supplemented by new regulations including the three disciplines of ceremonial [[flagellation]] prescribed for the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] every week, and the [[discalceation]] of the religious. For the first five years, Teresa remained in seclusion, mostly engaged in prayer and writing.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

===Extended travels===
In 1567, Teresa received a [[letters patent|patent]] from the Carmelite General, Rubeo de Ravenna, to establish further houses of the new [[Religious order|order]]. This process required many visitations and long journeys across nearly all the provinces of Spain. She left a record of the arduous project in her ''Libro de las Fundaciones''. Between 1567 and 1571, reformed convents were established at [[Medina del Campo]], [[Malagón]], [[Valladolid]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Pastrana, Spain|Pastrana]], [[Salamanca]], and [[Alba de Tormes]].

As part of the original patent, Teresa was given permission to set up two houses for [[Friar|men]] who wished to adopt the reforms. She convinced two Carmelite friars, [[John of the Cross]] and Father Anthony of Jesus to help with this. They founded the first monastery of Discalced Carmelite brothers in November 1568 at [[Duruelo]]. Another friend of Teresa, [[Jerónimo Gracián]], the [[Carmelite visitator]] of the older observance of [[Andalusia]] and apostolic commissioner, and later [[Provincial superior|provincial]] of the Teresian order, gave her powerful support in founding monasteries at [[Segovia]] (1571), [[Beas de Segura]] (1574), [[Seville]] (1575), and [[Caravaca de la Cruz]] ([[Murcia]], 1576). Meanwhile, John of the Cross promoted the inner life of the movement through his power as a teacher and preacher.{{sfn|Kavanaugh|Rodgriguez|1991|pp=9-27}}

===Opposition to reforms===
In 1576, unreformed members of the Carmelite order began to persecute Teresa, her supporters and her reforms. Following a number of resolutions adopted at the [[general chapter]] at [[Piacenza]], the governing body of the order forbade all further founding of reformed convents. The general chapter instructed her to go into &quot;voluntary&quot; retirement at one of her institutions.{{sfn|Kavanaugh|Rodgriguez|1991|pp=9-27}} She obeyed and chose St. Joseph's at Toledo. Meanwhile, her friends and associates were subjected to further attacks.{{sfn|Kavanaugh|Rodgriguez|1991|pp=9-27}}

Several years later, her appeals by letter to King [[Philip II of Spain]] secured relief. As a result, in 1579, the cases before the [[inquisition]] against her, Father Gracian and others, were dropped.{{sfn|Kavanaugh|Rodgriguez|1991|pp=9-27}} This allowed the reform to resume. An edict from [[Pope Gregory XIII]] allowed the appointment of a special provincial for the newer branch of the Carmelite religious, and a royal decree created a &quot;protective&quot; board of four assessors for the reform.{{sfn|Kavanaugh|Rodgriguez|1991|pp=9-27}}

During the last three years of her life, Teresa founded convents at [[Villanueva de la Jara]] in northern [[Andalusia]] (1580), [[Palencia]] (1580), [[Soria]] (1581), [[Burgos]], and [[Granada]] (1582). In total, seventeen convents, all but one founded by her, and as many men's monasteries, were owed to her reforms over twenty years.{{sfn|Salamony|2017|p=}}

==Last days==
Her final illness overtook her on one of her journeys from Burgos to Alba de Tormes. She died in 1582, just as [[Catholic Europe]] was making the switch from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]], which required the excision of the dates of 5–14 October from the calendar. She died either before midnight of 4 October or early in the morning of 15 October, which is celebrated as her feast day. According to the liturgical calendar then in use, she died on the 15th in any case. Her last words were: &quot;My Lord, it is time to move on. Well then, may your will be done. O my Lord and my Spouse, the hour that I have longed for has come. It is time to meet one another.&quot;{{sfn|Counsell|2011|p=207}}[[File:Avila SaintTheresa1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ávila, Spain|Avila]], Saint Theresa's statue|279x279px]]

===Holy relics===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2020}}
She was buried at the Convento de la Anunciación in [[Alba de Tormes]]. Nine months after her death the coffin was opened and her body was found to be [[Incorruptibility|intact]] but the clothing had rotted. Before the body was re-interred one of her hands was cut off, wrapped in a scarf and sent to Ávila. Father Gracián cut the little finger off the hand and – according to his own account – kept it with him until it was taken by the occupying [[Ottoman Turk]]s, from whom he had to redeem it with a few rings and 20 reales. The body was exhumed again on 25 November 1585 to be moved to Ávila and found to be incorrupt. An arm was removed and left in Alba de Tormes at the nuns' request, to compensate for losing the main relic of Teresa, but the rest of the body was reburied in the Discalced Carmelite chapter house in Ávila. The removal was done without the approval of the Duke of Alba de Tormes and he brought the body back in 1586, with [[Pope Sixtus V]] ordering that it remain in Alba de Tormes on pain of excommunication. A grander tomb on the original site was raised in 1598 and the body was moved to a new chapel in 1616.

The body still remains there, except for the following parts:
* Rome – right foot and part of the upper jaw
* [[Lisbon]] – left hand
* [[Ronda]], Spain – left eye and right hand (the latter was kept by [[Francisco Franco]] until his death after Francoist troops captured it from Republican troops during the [[Spanish Civil War]])
* Museum of the Church of the Annunciation, Alba de Tormes – left arm and heart
* Church of Our Lady of Loreto, [[Paris]], France – one finger
* [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] – one finger

==Canonization==
In 1622, forty years after her death, she was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XV]]. The [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] exalted her to [[patron saint|patroness]] of Spain in 1627. The [[University of Salamanca]] had granted her the title ''[[Doctor ecclesiae]]'' ([[Latin]] for &quot;Doctor of the Church&quot;) with a diploma in her lifetime but that title is distinct from the papal honour of [[Doctor of the Church]], which is always conferred posthumously. The latter was finally bestowed upon her by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 27 September 1970,{{sfn|Pope Paul VI|1970a}} along with [[Saint Catherine of Siena]],{{sfn|Pope Paul VI|1970b}} making them the first women to be awarded the distinction. Teresa is revered as the Doctor of Prayer. The mysticism in her works exerted a formative influence upon many theologians of the following centuries, such as [[Francis of Sales]], [[Fénelon]], and the [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royalists]]. In 1670, her coffin was plated in silver.

[[File:Palau de Mafra - Estàtua - 1.jpg|thumb|Statue of Saint Teresa of Ávila in [[Mafra National Palace]], [[Mafra, Portugal|Mafra]]]]

==Mysticism==
The ultimate preoccupation of Teresa's mystical thought, as consistently reflected in her writings, is the ascent of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to God in four stages (see: ''The Autobiography'' Chs. 10–22):

* The first, ''Devotion of the Heart'', consists of [[mental prayer]] and [[Contemplation (Christianity)|contemplation]]. It means the withdrawal of the soul from without, [[penitence]] and especially the devout [[Meditations on the Life of Christ|meditation]] on the passion of Christ (''Autobiography'' 11.20).
* The second, ''Devotion of Peace'', is where human will is surrendered to God. This occurs by virtue of an uplifted awareness granted by God, while other faculties, such as memory, reason, and imagination, are not yet safe from worldly distraction. Although a partial distraction can happen, due to outer activity such as repetition of prayers or writing down spiritual things, the prevailing state is one of quietude (''Autobiography'' 14.1).
* The third, ''Devotion of Union'', concerns the absorption-in-God. It is not only a heightened, but essentially, an [[religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] state. At this level, reason is also surrendered to God, and only the memory and imagination are left to ramble. This state is characterized by a blissful peace, a sweet slumber of at least the ''higher soul faculties'', that is a consciousness of being enraptured by the love of God.
* The fourth, ''Devotion of Ecstasy'', is where the consciousness of being in the body disappears. Sensory faculties cease to operate. Memory and imagination also become absorbed in God, as though intoxicated. Body and spirit dwell in the throes of exquisite pain, alternating between a fearful fiery glow, in complete unconscious helplessness, and periods of apparent strangulation. Sometimes such ecstatic transports literally cause the body to be lifted into space.{{sfn|Clissold|1982|pp=63-64}} This state may last as long as half an hour and tends to be followed by relaxation of a few hours of swoon-like weakness, attended by the absence of all faculties while in union with God. The subject awakens from this trance state in tears. It may be regarded as the culmination of mystical experience. Indeed, Teresa was said to have been observed [[levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Clissold|1982|pp=63-64}}

Teresa is regarded as one of the foremost writers on mental prayer, and her position among writers on mystical theology as unique. Her writings on this theme stem from her personal experiences, thereby manifesting considerable insight and analytical gifts. Her definitions have been used in the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. Teresa states: &quot;Contemplative prayer (''oración mental)'', in my opinion is nothing other than a close sharing between friends. It means frequently taking time to be alone with Him whom we know loves us.&quot;&lt;ref name=catechism /&gt; Throughout her writings, Teresa returns to the image of watering one's garden as a metaphor for mystical prayer.

==Writings==

{{refend}}
* Her rare poems (''&quot;Todas las poesías&quot;'', [[Munster]], 1854) are distinguished for tenderness of feeling and rhythm of thought.

===Philosophical works===
[[Christia Mercer]], Columbia University philosophy professor, claims that the seventeenth-century Frenchman [[René Descartes]] lifted some of his most influential ideas from Teresa of Ávila, who, fifty years before Descartes, wrote popular books about the role of philosophical reflection in intellectual growth.{{sfn|Mercer|2017|pp=2539-2555}} She describes a number of striking similarities between Descartes' seminal work ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' and Teresa's ''Interior Castle''.&lt;ref name=CM2017 /&gt;

===Excerpts===
Teresa, who reported [[visions of Jesus and Mary]], was a strong believer in the efficacy of [[holy water]], claiming to have used it with success to repel evil spirits and temptations. She wrote:&quot;I know from frequent experience that there is nothing which puts devils to flight better than holy water.&quot;{{sfn|Teresa of Avila|Starr|2008|pp=238–241}}

A poem:

{{poemquote|
Let nothing disturb you.
Let nothing make you afraid.
All things are passing.
God alone never changes.
Patience gains all things.
If you have God you will want for nothing.
God alone suffices.

The modern poem ''Christ has no body'', though widely attributed to Teresa,{{sfn|Howell|2009|p=151}}&lt;ref name=jwj /&gt; is not found in her writings.{{sfn|Knowles|2009|p=684}}

==Legacy regarding the Infant Jesus of Prague==
The Spanish nuns who established ''Carmel'' in France brought a devotion to the [[Infant Jesus]] with them, and it became widespread in France.{{sfn|Darricau|n.d.}}&lt;ref name=thereseoflisieux.org /&gt;

Though there are no written historical accounts establishing that Teresa of Ávila ever owned the famous [[Infant Jesus of Prague]] statue, according to tradition, such a statue is said to have been in her possession and Teresa is reputed to have given it to a noblewoman travelling to [[Prague]].{{sfn|Wong|n.d.}}&lt;ref name=pragjesu.info /&gt;&lt;ref name=devotionsandprayers /&gt;&lt;ref name=saints.sqpn.com /&gt; The age of the statue dates to approximately the same time as Teresa. It has been thought that Teresa carried a portable statue of the [[Child Jesus]] wherever she went; the idea circulated by the early 1700s.{{sfn|Santini|1995|p=}}{{page number|date=October 2020}}[[File:SantaTeresa.jpg|upright|thumb|left|&quot;It is love alone that gives worth to all things.&quot;]]

==Patron saint==
In 1626, at the request of [[Philip IV of Spain]], the [[Cortes of Castile and León|Castilian parliament]]{{efn|{{harvnb|Rowe|2011|p=47}} refers to the Castilian Cortes as the &quot;Castilian parliament&quot;}} elected Teresa &quot;without lacking one vote&quot; as copatron saint of Castile.{{sfn|Rowe|2011|p=77}} This status was affirmed by [[Pope Urban VIII]] in a brief issued on 21 July 1627 in which he stated:
{{quote|For these reasons [the king's and Cortes's elections] and for the great devotion which they have for Teresa, they elected her for patron and advocate of these kingdoms in the last Cortes of the aforementioned kingdoms.... And because... the representatives in the Cortes desired it so greatly that their vote be firm and perpetual, we grant it our patronage and the approval of the [[Holy See|Holy Apostolic See]].|source={{harvnb|Rowe|2011|pp=77–78}}
}}

More broadly, the 1620s, the entirety of Spain (Castile and beyond) debated who should be the country's [[patron saint]]; the choices were either the current patron, [[Saint James Matamoros]], or a pairing of him and the newly canonised Saint Teresa of Ávila. Teresa's promoters said Spain faced newer challenges, especially the threat of Protestantism and societal decline at home, thus needing a more contemporary patron who understood those issues and could guide the Spanish nation. Santiago's supporters (''Santiaguistas'') fought back and eventually won the argument, but Teresa of Ávila remained far more popular at the local level.{{sfn|Rowe|2011|p=}}{{page number|date=October 2020}} [[Saint James the Greater]] kept the title of patron saint for the [[Spanish people]], and the most [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under the title [[Immaculate Conception]] as the sole patroness for the entire [[Spanish Kingdom]].

The majority of [[optical fiber]]s for [[telecommunication]] are also made from silica. It is a primary raw material for many ceramics such as [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]], and [[porcelain]].

Silicon dioxide is used to produce elemental [[silicon]]. The process involves [[carbothermic reduction]] in an [[electric arc furnace]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shriver &amp; Atkins' inorganic chemistry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199236176|veditors=Atkins PW, Overton T, Rourke J, Weller M, Armstrong F|edition=5th|location=Oxford|pages=354|oclc=430678988|display-editors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fumed silica===
[[Fumed silica]], also known as pyrogenic silica, is prepared by burning [[silicon tetrachloride|SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] in an oxygen-rich hydrogen flame to produce a &quot;smoke&quot; of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot;&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|pages=393–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;chem&gt;SiCl4 + 2 H2 + O2 -&gt; SiO2 + 4 HCl&lt;/chem&gt;
It can also be produced by vaporizing quartz sand in a 3000&amp;nbsp;°C electric arc. Both processes result in microscopic droplets of amorphous silica fused into branched, chainlike, three-dimensional secondary particles which then agglomerate into tertiary particles, a white powder with extremely low bulk density (0.03-.15 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and thus high surface area.&lt;ref name=cabot&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cabotcorp.com |title= Cab-O-Sil Fumed Metal Oxides}}&lt;/ref&gt; The particles act as a [[Thixotropy|thixotropic]] thickening agent, or as an anti-caking agent, and can be treated to make them hydrophilic or hydrophobic for either water or organic liquid applications

[[Silica fume]] is an ultrafine powder collected as a by-product of the silicon and [[ferrosilicon]] alloy production. It consists of [[amorphous]] (non-crystalline) spherical particles with an average particle diameter of 150&amp;nbsp;nm, without the branching of the pyrogenic product. The main use is as [[pozzolanic]] material for high performance concrete.

===Food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications===
Silica, either colloidal, precipitated, or pyrogenic fumed, is a common additive in food production. It is used primarily as a flow or anti-caking agent in powdered foods such as spices and non-dairy coffee creamer, or powders to be formed into pharmaceutical tablets.&lt;ref name=cabot/&gt; It can [[adsorption|adsorb]] water in [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] applications. [[Colloidal silica]] is used as a [[fining agent]] for wine, beer, and juice, with the [[E number]] reference '''E551'''.&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt;

In cosmetics, silica is useful for its light-diffusing properties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RIvOBQAAQBAJ&amp;q=silica%20cosmetics%20light%20diffusing&amp;pg=PA444|title=Handbook of Cosmetic Science and Technology|vauthors=Barel AO, Paye M, Maibach HI|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781842145654|edition=4th|pages=444|quote=These soft focus pigments, mainly composed of polymers, micas and talcs covered with rough or spherical particles of small diameters, such as silica or titanium dioxide, are used to optically reduce the appearance of wrinkles.

[[Diatomaceous earth]], a mined product, has been used in food and cosmetics for centuries.  It consists of the silica shells of microscopic [[diatoms]]; in a less processed form it was sold as &quot;tooth powder&quot;.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} Manufactured or mined [[hydrated silica]] is used as the hard abrasive in [[toothpaste]].

===Semiconductors===
{{See also|Surface passivation|Thermal oxidation|Planar process|MOSFET}}

Silicon dioxide is widely used in the semiconductor technology 

* for the primary passivation (directly on the semiconductor surface),
* as an original gate dielectric in MOS technology. Today when scaling (dimension of the gate length of the MOS transistor) has progressed below 10 nm silicon dioxide has been replaced by other dielectric materials like hafnium oxide or similar with higher dielectric constant compared to silicon dioxide,
* as a dielectric layer between metal (wiring) layers (sometimes up to 8-10) connecting elements to each other and
* as a secondary passivation layer (for protecting semiconductor elements and the metallization layers) typically today layered with some other dielectrics like [[silicon nitride]].

Because silicon dioxide is a native oxide of silicon it is more widely used compared to other semiconductors like [[Gallium arsenide]] or [[Indium phosphide]].

The process of silicon surface passivation by [[thermal oxidation]] (silicon dioxide) is critical to the [[semiconductor industry]]. It is commonly used to manufacture [[metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor]]s (MOSFETs) and silicon [[integrated circuit]] chips (with the [[planar process]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;atalla&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kahng&quot;/&gt;

Pure silica (silicon dioxide), when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point, can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass.

==Production==
Silicon dioxide is mostly obtained by mining, including [[sand mining]] and purification of [[quartz]]. 
Quartz is suitable for many purposes, while chemical processing is required to make a purer or otherwise more suitable (e.g. more reactive or fine-grained) product.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Precipitated silica===
Precipitated silica or amorphous silica is produced by the acidification of solutions of [[sodium silicate]]. The gelatinous precipitate or [[silica gel]], is first washed and then dehydrated to produce colorless microporous silica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt;  The idealized equation involving a trisilicate and [[sulfuric acid]] is:
:&lt;chem&gt;Na2Si3O7 + H2SO4 -&gt; 3 SiO2 + Na2SO4 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Approximately one billion kilograms/year (1999) of silica were produced in this manner, mainly for use for polymer composites – tires and shoe soles.&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt;

===On microchips===
Thin films of silica grow spontaneously on [[silicon wafer]]s via [[thermal oxidation]], producing a very shallow layer of about 1 [[nanometre|nm]] or 10 [[angstrom|Å]] of so-called native oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qi98H-iTgLEC|title=Handbook of Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=9781574446753|veditors=Doering R, Nishi Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Higher temperatures and alternative environments are used to grow well-controlled layers of silicon dioxide on silicon, for example at temperatures between 600 and 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, using so-called dry  oxidation with [[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

:&lt;chem&gt;Si + 2 H2O -&gt; SiO2 + 2 H2&lt;/chem&gt;

The native oxide layer is beneficial in [[microelectronics]], where it acts as [[electric insulator]] with high chemical stability. It can protect the silicon, store charge, block current, and even act as a controlled pathway to limit current flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-silicon-dioxide-solution|title=The Silicon Dioxide Solution: How physicist Jean Hoerni built the bridge from the transistor to the integrated circuit|last=Riordan M|date=2007|work=[[IEEE Spectrum]]|access-date=11 Feb 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory or special methods===

==== From organosilicon compounds ====
Many routes to silicon dioxide start with an organosilicon compound, e.g., HMDSO,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chrystie|first1=Robin S. M.|last2=Ebertz|first2=Felix L.|last3=Dreier|first3=Thomas|last4=Schulz|first4=Christof|date=2019-01-28|title=Absolute SiO concentration imaging in low-pressure nanoparticle-synthesis flames via laser-induced fluorescence|journal=Applied Physics B|language=en|volume=125|issue=2|pages=29|doi=10.1007/s00340-019-7137-8|issn=1432-0649|bibcode=2019ApPhB.125...29C|s2cid=127735545}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEOS. Synthesis of silica is illustrated below using [[tetraethyl orthosilicate]] (TEOS).  Simply heating TEOS at 680–730&amp;nbsp;°C results in the oxide:

:&lt;chem&gt;Si(OC2H5)4 -&gt; SiO2 + 2 O(C2H5)2&lt;/chem&gt;

Similarly TEOS combusts around 400&amp;nbsp;°C:

:&lt;chem&gt;Si(OC2H5)4 + 12 O2 -&gt; SiO2 + 10 H2O + 8 CO2&lt;/chem&gt;

TEOS undergoes [[hydrolysis]] via the so-called [[sol-gel process]].  The course of the reaction and nature of the product are affected by catalysts, but the idealized equation is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Nandiyanto AB, Kim SG, Iskandar F, Okuyama K|year=2009|title=Synthesis of spherical mesoporous silica nanoparticles with nanometer-size controllable pores and outer diameters|journal=Microporous and Mesoporous Materials|volume=120|issue=3|pages=447–453|doi=10.1016/j.micromeso.2008.12.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;Si(OC2H5)4 + 2 H2O -&gt; SiO2 + 4 HOCH2CH3&lt;/chem&gt;

====Other methods====
Being highly stable, silicon dioxide arises from many methods. Conceptually simple, but of little practical value, combustion of [[silane]] gives silicon dioxide.  This reaction is analogous to the combustion of methane:

:&lt;chem&gt;SiH4 + 2 O2 -&gt; SiO2 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

However the [[chemical vapor deposition]] of silicon dioxide onto crystal surface from silane had been used using nitrogen as a '''carrier gas''' at 200–500&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan&amp;Board2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction To Semiconductor Microtechnology|vauthors=Morgan DV, Board K|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1991|isbn=9780471924784|edition=2nd|location=Chichester, West Sussex, England|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical reactions==
Silica is converted to silicon by reduction with carbon.

Fluorine reacts with silicon dioxide to form SiF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; whereas the other halogen gases (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are essentially unreactive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt;

Silicon dioxide is attacked by [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) to produce [[hexafluorosilicic acid]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiberg&amp;Holleman&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;SiO2 + 6 HF -&gt; H2SiF6 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

HF is used to remove or pattern silicon dioxide in the semiconductor industry.

Under normal conditions, silicon does not react with most acids but is dissolved by hydrofluoric acid.
:&lt;chem&gt;Si(s) + 6HF(aq) -&gt; [SiF6]^{2-}(aq) + 2H+(aq) + 2H2(g)&lt;/chem&gt;
Silicon is attacked by bases such as aqueous sodium hydroxide to give silicates.
:&lt;chem&gt;Si(s) + 4NaOH(aq) -&gt; [SiO4]^{4-}(aq) + 4Na+(aq) + 2H2(g)&lt;/chem&gt;

Silicon dioxide acts as a [[Acid–base reaction#Lux–Flood definition|Lux–Flood acid]], being able to react with bases under certain conditions. As it does not contain any hydrogen, it cannot act as a [[Brønsted–Lowry acid-base theory|Brønsted–Lowry acid]]. While silicon dioxide is not soluble in water, some strong bases will react with glass and have to be stored in plastic bottles as a result.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodgers2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BY8IAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA421|title=Descriptive Inorganic, Coordination, and Solid State Chemistry|vauthors=Rodgers GE|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn=9781133172482|pages=421–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicon dioxide dissolves in hot concentrated alkali or fused hydroxide, as described in this idealized equation:&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;SiO2 + 2 NaOH -&gt; Na2SiO3 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Silicon dioxide will neutralise basic metal oxides (e.g. [[sodium oxide]], [[potassium oxide]], [[lead(II) oxide]], [[zinc oxide]], or mixtures of oxides, forming [[silicate]]s and glasses as the Si-O-Si bonds in silica are broken successively).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiberg&amp;Holleman&quot;/&gt; As an example the reaction of sodium oxide and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can produce sodium orthosilicate, sodium silicate, and glasses, dependent on the proportions of reactants:&lt;ref name = &quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;2 Na2O + SiO2 -&gt; Na4SiO4;&lt;/chem&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;Na2O + SiO2 -&gt; Na2SiO3;&lt;/chem&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(0.25-0.8)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;chem&gt;Na2O + SiO2 -&gt; glass&lt;/chem&gt;.

Examples of such glasses have commercial significance, e.g. [[soda-lime glass]], [[borosilicate glass]], [[lead glass]]. In these glasses, silica is termed the network former or lattice former.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiberg&amp;Holleman&quot;/&gt; The reaction is also used in [[blast furnace]]s to remove sand impurities in the ore by neutralisation with calcium oxide, forming [[calcium silicate]] [[slag]].

===Water solubility===
The solubility of silicon dioxide in water strongly depends on its crystalline form and is three-four times higher for silica{{clarify|date=August 2019}} than quartz; as a function of temperature, it peaks around 340&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fournier RO, Rowe JJ|year=1977|title=The solubility of amorphous silica in water at high temperatures and high pressures|url=http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM62/AM62_1052.pdf|journal=[[American Mineralogist|Am.

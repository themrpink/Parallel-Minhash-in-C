{{further|Third Servile War}}
In 73&amp;nbsp;BC, a slave revolt (known as the [[Third Servile War]]) under the ex-gladiator of Capua, [[Spartacus]], began against the Romans. Slavery accounted for roughly every third person in Italy.

Spartacus defeated many Roman armies in a conflict that lasted for over two years. While trying to escape from Italy at Brundisium he unwittingly moved his forces into the historic trap in Apulia/Calabria. The Romans were well acquainted with the region. Legions were brought home from abroad and Spartacus was pinned between armies. The ex-slave army was defeated at Siler River by [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]. Pompey's armies captured and killed several thousand rebels that escaped from the battle and Crassus captured several thousand more. The Romans judged that the slaves had forfeited their right to live. In 71&amp;nbsp;BC, 6,000 slaves were [[crucifixion|crucified]] along the {{convert|200|km|sp=us|adj=on}} Via Appia from Rome to Capua.&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#120 1.120].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The World War II battle of Anzio ===
{{Main article|Battle of Anzio}}
In 1943, during [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] fell into the same trap Pyrrhus had retreated to avoid, in the [[Pontine Marshes|Pomptine fields]], the successor to the [[Pomptine Marshes|Pomptine marshes]]. The marsh remained, despite many efforts to drain it, until engineers working for [[Benito Mussolini]] finally succeeded. (Even so, the fields were infested with [[malaria]]l [[mosquitos]] until the advent of [[DDT]] in the 1950s.)

Hoping to break a stalemate at [[Monte Cassino]], the Allies landed on the coast of Italy at [[Nettuno]], ancient Antium, which was midway between [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]] and [[Terracina]]. They found that the place was undefended. They intended to move along the line of the via Appia to take Rome, outflanking [[Monte Cassino]], but they did not do so quickly enough. The Germans occupied Mounts Laziali and Lepini along the track of the old Via Latina, from which they rained down shells on Anzio. Even though the Allies expanded into all the Pomptine region, they gained no ground. The Germans counterattacked down the via Appia from the Alban hills in a front four miles wide, but could not retake Anzio. The battle lasted for four months, one side being supplied by sea, the other by land through Rome. In May 1944, the Allies broke out of Anzio and took [[Rome]]. The German forces escaped to the north of [[Florence]].

===1960 Summer Olympics===
For the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], it served as part of the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|men's marathon]] course that was won by [[Abebe Bikila]] of [[Ethiopia at the 1960 Summer Olympics|Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1960/OR1960v1.pdf 1960 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031012134/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1960/OR1960v1.pdf |date=31 October 2008 }} Volume 1. pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1960/OR1960v2pt1.pdf 1960 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527211502/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1960/OR1960v2pt1.pdf |date=27 May 2008 }} Volume 2.

[[File:Via Appia Antica Rome 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Via Appia Antica 4.1 km South-East from Porta Appia ([[Porta San Sebastiano]]), the gate of the Aurelian Walls]]

=== Via Appia antica ===
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the road fell out of use; [[Pope Pius VI]] ordered its restoration. A new Appian Way was built in parallel with the old one in 1784 as far as the Alban Hills region. The new road is the ''Via Appia Nuova'' (&quot;New Appian Way&quot;) as opposed to the old section, now known as ''Via Appia Antica''. The old Appian Way close to Rome is now a free tourist attraction. It was extensively restored for Rome's [[Millennium]] and [[Great Jubilee]] celebrations. The first {{convert|3|mi|km|0|sp=us|order=flip}} are still heavily used by cars, buses and coaches but from then on traffic is very light and the ruins can be explored on foot in relative safety. The [[Church of Domine Quo Vadis]] is in the second mile of the road. Along or close to the part of the road closest to Rome, there are three [[catacombs]] of Roman and early [[Christians|Christian]] origin and one of [[Vigna Randanini|Jewish origin]].

The construction of Rome's ring road, the [[Grande Raccordo Anulare]] or GRA, in 1951 caused the Appian Way to be cut in two. More recent improvements to the GRA have rectified this through the construction of a tunnel under the Appia, so that it is now possible to follow the Appia on foot for about {{convert|10|mi|km|sp=us|order=flip|abbr=on}} from its beginning near the [[Baths of Caracalla]].

Many parts of the original road beyond Rome's environs have been preserved, and some are now used by cars (for example, in the area of [[Velletri]]). The road inspires the last movement of [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s ''[[Pini di Roma]]''. To this day the Via Appia contains the longest stretch of straight road in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0706.1325|title=Astronomical references in the planning of ancient roads |last1=Magli |first1=Giulio |class=physics.hist-ph |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; totaling {{convert|62|km|0|abbr=on}}.

''Esox americanus vermiculatus'' &lt;small&gt;[[Charles Alexandre Lesueur|Lesueur]], 1846&lt;/small&gt;
}}

The '''American pickerels''' are two [[subspecies]] of ''Esox americanus'', a [[species]] of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the pike [[family (biology)|family]] (family [[Esocidae]]) of [[order (biology)|order]] [[Esociformes]]: the [[redfin pickerel]], ''E. americanus americanus'' [[Gmelin (taxonomy)|Gmelin]], 1789, and the [[grass pickerel]], ''E. americanus vermiculatus'' [[Lesueur (taxonomy)|Lesueur]], 1846.

Both subspecies are native to [[North America]]. They are not to be confused with their aggressive counterpart the [[Northern pike]]. The redfin pickerel's range extends from the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence]] drainage in [[Quebec]] down to the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]], from [[Mississippi]] to [[Florida]], while the grass pickerel's [[range (biology)|range]] is further west, extending from the [[Great Lakes Basin]], from [[Ontario]] to [[Michigan]], down to the western Gulf Coast, from eastern [[Texas]] to [[Mississippi]].

The two subspecies are very similar, but the grass pickerel lacks the redfin's distinctive orange to red fin coloration, its fins having dark leading edges and amber to dusky coloration. In addition, the light areas between the dark bands are generally wider on the grass pickerel and narrower on the redfin pickerel. Record size Grass and Redfin Pickerels can weigh around 2 pounds &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/7935.html |website=dec.ny.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reach lengths of around 13 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/7034.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Redfin and Grass Pickerels are typically smaller than [[Chain pickerel|Chain Pickerels]] which can be much larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/7034.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redfin and grass pickerels occur primarily in sluggish, vegetated waters of pools, [[lake]]s, and swamps, and are [[carnivorous]], feeding on smaller fish. Larger fishes, such as the [[striped bass]] (''Morone saxatilis''), [[bowfin]] (''Amia calva''), and gray [[weakfish]] (''Cynoscion regalis''), in turn, prey on the pickerels when they venture into larger rivers or [[estuaries]].

These fishes reproduce by scattering spherical, sticky [[bird egg|eggs]] in shallow, heavily vegetated waters. The eggs hatch in 11&amp;ndash;15 days; the adults guard neither the eggs nor the young.

The ''E. americanus'' subspecies are not as highly prized as a [[game fish]] as their larger cousins, the [[northern pike]] and [[muskellunge]], but they are caught by [[fishing|anglers]]. ''[[McClane's Standard Fishing Encyclopedia]]'' describes [[Fishing rod#Ultra-light rods|ultralight tackle]] as a sporty if overlooked method to catch these small but voracious pikes.

[[Lesueur (taxonomy)|Lesueur]] originally classified the grass pickerel as ''E. vermiculatus,'' but it is now considered a subspecies of ''E. americanus.''

''E. americanus americanus'' is sometimes called the brook pickerel. There is no widely accepted [[English language|English]] common collective name for the two ''E. americanus'' subspecies; &quot;American pickerel&quot; is a translation of the systematic name and the [[French language|French]] ''brochet d'Amérique.''

'''Redfish''' is a [[common name]] for several [[species]] of [[fish]]. It is most commonly applied to certain deep-sea rockfish in the [[genus]] ''[[Sebastes]]'', or the reef dwelling snappers in the genus ''[[Lutjanus]]''. It is also applied to the [[slimehead]]s or roughies (family Trachichthyidae), and the [[Berycidae|alfonsinos]] (Berycidae).

'''''Porgy''''' is a novel written by the American author [[DuBose Heyward]] and published by the [[George H. Doran Company]] in 1925.

The novel tells the story of Porgy, a crippled street beggar living in the black tenements of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in the 1920s. The character was based on Charlestonian Samuel Smalls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://charlestonmag.com/features/the_real_porgy &quot;The Real Porgy&quot;], ''Charleston Mag'', May 2014. &lt;/ref&gt; In some of the novel's passages, black characters speak in [[Gullah language|Gullah]], a [[creole language]] that had developed among enslaved African Americans during the slavery years on the Sea Islands.

The novel was adapted for a [[Porgy (play)|1927 play]] of the same name by Heyward and his wife, playwright [[Dorothy Heyward]]. Even before completing the play, Heyward was in discussions with composer [[George Gershwin]] for an operatic version of his novel. This was produced in 1935 as ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (renamed to distinguish it from the play{{cn|date=July 2020}}).

The '''weakfish''', ''Cynoscion regalis'', is a marine [[fish]] of the drum family [[Sciaenidae]].

A medium-large, slender, marine fish, it is found along the east coast of North America. The head and back of this fish are dark brown in color with a greenish tinge.  The sides have a faint silvery hue with dusky specks, and the belly is white.  The origin of its name is based on the weakness of the mouth muscles, which often cause a hook to tear free, allowing the fish to escape.  The weakfish grows to {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight.  It is found along the eastern coast of North America from [[Nova Scotia]], Canada to northern [[Florida]], where it is fished both commercially and recreationally.

Weakfish are also known by the American Indian name '''Squeteague'''. In the mid-Atlantic states, the fish is sometimes referred to by the name '''sea trout''', though it is not related to the fishes properly called trout, which are in the family Salmonidae.

The weakfish  is the [[List of U.S. state fish|state fish]] of [[Delaware]].

==Management==
Weakfish stocks have been generally low in recent years due to fishing and natural mortality increasing. Management of the species includes gear regulations, seasonal fishing, [[bycatch]] limitations, minimum size limits, commercial creel limits, and bycatch reduction gear. It is hoped that these regulations incorporated with others will help weakfish populations come back to a sustainable point.

==Appearance==
The weakfish (''Cynoscion regalis'') is a salt-water fish native to the mid Atlantic region of the east coast of the United States. Ranging from 12-18 inches once fully matured, with some adults reaching well above this range at up to 3 feet and 18 lbs. The weakfish can live up to 17 years but have an average lifespan of 9 to 12 years (Chesapeake).

==Diet==
The weakfish prey on a wide variety of species, including, small schooling fish like anchovies and Atlantic Menhaden, assorted crabs, shrimp, mollusks, and even large zooplankton. Weakfish move toward their prey slowly and once upon them they attack aggressively with an open jaw (Chesapeake).
Although being a predatory fish and on a higher trophic level the weakfish are also a food source for other larger fish. Some examples of fish that prey on the weakfish include the bluefish, the [[striped bass]], and the [[dusky shark]] (Chesapeake).
    
==Breeding==
These fish mainly spawn from April to August. This spawning takes place in the shallow waters of estuaries. Their young are in the form of zooplankton, floating freely with the tidal current. They flow with these currents until reaching their nursery area of low salinity rivers. Once these fish grow large enough in these areas, they begin to migrate back to the saltier waters to which they were spawned. They stay in these intertidal bay zone until winter, then join the schooling fish towards deeper offshore waters. The males have the ability to perform a deep croaking sound as shown by the Chesapeake Bay field guide (Chesapeake). The reason why these fish have the capability to do this is because they are a part of the drum family. This trait is very common in species that belong to the drum family and is commonly used for mating purposes. It is believed that weakfish also use this to attract other females as stated in a study done at the [[University of Michigan]], &quot;There is some evidence that the male weakfish croaking sound may be used in attracting a mate and playing a role in the spawning behavior. This is because the male's sonic muscles, which are used to produce ‘drumming' and ‘croaking' sounds, increases three times its usual mass during spawning season&quot; (Gillum). This study shows that weakfish make use of their drum sound more frequently during the mating season, suggesting that it is used as a process for males to attract females.

==Behavior==
Weakfish are schooling fish, meaning that they spend a large majority of their time swimming together either trying to evade larger predators, or trying to feed more efficiently on prey. Studies done by the university of Michigan state that these schooling patterns tend to become much tighter in signs of stress as they state, &quot;weakfish have an acute chemosensory response mechanism. In times of stress, weakfish gather into tighter schools, this was seen in lab studies when higher temperatures were used. The weakfish under these conditions showed a 35% decrease in their distance to the other fish in the school. Also the frequency of school formation increased in response to stress&quot; (Gillum). Weakfish school closer together when in situations of high stress in this study done by the university of Michigan. Theorizing that they use schooling as a form of protection. 
    
==Economic importance==
Weakfish are excellent table fare; they can be used as a food source. The weakfish are recreationally fished and provide tackle shops with business. 
	
==Recreational fishing==
Weakfish are finicky. They are very shy and prey selective; making them a harder fish to target recreationally, this provides a good challenge for anglers. They prefer a water temperature ranging from 50 degree F to 65 degrees F. This is the best time to target weakfish, as they are most actively breeding within these temperatures. They can be found feeding in temperatures exclusive to these numbers, but they may be much more finicky and hard to hook. The weakfish also have a very fragile mouth, making it hard for anglers to keep them from spitting the hook.

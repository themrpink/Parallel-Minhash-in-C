The Dodge Durango is a [[mid-size]] [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV) produced by Dodge. The first two generations were very similar in that both were based on the [[Dodge Dakota]], both featured a [[body-on-frame]] construction and both were produced at the [[Newark Assembly]] Plant in [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], Delaware. The Durango was marketed as a sturdy truck-based SUV designed to hold up to seven passengers and tow up to {{cvt|7,500|lb|kg}} when properly equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/list/top10/102426/article.html |title=Top 10 Vehicles for Towing |date=2004 |work=Edmunds.com |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090831070459/http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/list/top10/102426/article.html |archive-date=August 31, 2009 |accessdate=December 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Durango shared a front end, instrument panel, and front seats with the Dakota pickup on which it was based. Original designs of the eight-passenger Durango featured a rear-facing third row similar to many older [[station wagons]]. To make room for a more practical forward-facing third row, Dodge shortened the length of the front doors and raised the roof two inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) beyond the front seats, allowing for [[stadium seating]]. The Durango's roof rack was designed to mask the appearance of the raised roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allpar.com/model/durango-trucks/interior.html |title= Developing the 1997-2003 Dodge Durango interior |work= Allpar.com |accessdate= 2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The modern era: 1998–present==
===DaimlerChrysler and private ownership===
[[File:Black Charger SRT.JPG|right|thumb|2006 Dodge Charger SRT8 sedan]]

In a move that never lived up to the expectations of its driving forces, Chrysler Corporation merged with Daimler-Benz AG in 1998 to form DaimlerChrysler. Rationalizing Chrysler's broad lineup was a priority, and Dodge's sister brand Plymouth was withdrawn from the market. With this move, Dodge became DaimlerChrysler's low-price division as well as its performance division.

The Intrepid, Stratus, and Neon updates of the 1998 to 2000 timeframe were largely complete before Daimler's presence, and Dodge's first experience of any platform sharing with the German side of the company was the 2005 [[Dodge Magnum|Magnum]] [[station wagon]], introduced as a replacement for the Intrepid. Featuring Chrysler's first mainstream [[rear-wheel drive]] platform since the 1980s and a revival of the Hemi V8 engine. The [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Charger]] was launched in 2006 on the same platform.

In 2000, the Stratus became the last of the surviving Cloud Cars, with the Cirrus renamed as the Sebring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/chrysler-sebring-lxi-road-test |title=Chrysler Sebring LXi Road Test |magazine=Car and Driver |date=December 2000 |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |first=Larry |last=Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Breeze discontinued (along with the Plymouth brand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://consumerguide.com/used/1996-00-plymouth-breeze/ |title=1996–2000 Plymouth Breeze |publisher=Consumer Guide Auto |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation of the Dodge Stratus was not sold in [[Canada]], although 1999 was the last year for Dodge Stratus sales in Canada. 2002 models dropped the &quot;DODGE&quot; badges from the doors. During this time, sales declined as its ratings from consumer and auto magazines fell below average among mid-size cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/03q1/2003_dodge_stratus_vs._honda_accord_hyundai_sonata_kia_optima_and_six_more_mid-size_sedans-comparison_tests |title=2003 Dodge Stratus vs. Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima, and Six More Mid-Size Sedans - Comparison Tests |first=Barry |last=Winfield |journal=Car and Driver |date=February 2003 |accessdate=2010-07-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731074726/http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/03q1/2003_dodge_stratus_vs._honda_accord_hyundai_sonata_kia_optima_and_six_more_mid-size_sedans-comparison_tests |archive-date=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the sedan market had shifted and pushed the larger Intrepid and later [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Charger]] to record sales. 2004 brought styling revisions, which did not reverse this trend. The Stratus was discontinued in May 2006 (the Sebring name was continued). 
[[File:Dodge-Stratus-2.jpg|thumb|left|2004–2006 Dodge Stratus sedan]]

The Dodge Avenger name returned in February 2007 as a 2008 model year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=New Dodge costs less than outgoing model |magazine=Autoweek |first=Bradford |last=Wernle |url= http://autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070117/FREE/70116004/1528/vents |date=January 17, 2007 |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sedan to replace the [[Dodge Stratus]], whose coupe version had replaced the original Avenger in 2001. According to some reports, the Avenger, along with the redesigned [[Chrysler Sebring]], shares a [[DaimlerChrysler]]/[[Mitsubishi Motors]] platform called JS which used the Mitsubishi GS as a starting point. The base engine in the '''SE''' and '''SXT''' trim levels was the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance|GEMA]] I4 naturally aspirated &quot;World Engine&quot;, a joint venture between [[DaimlerChrysler]], [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], and [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]]. Additional engines included an optional 2.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 in the '''SXT''' and a standard 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 in the '''R/T''' trim level. In addition to the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L &quot;World Engine&quot; and the V6s, export vehicles were offered with the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L naturally aspirated &quot;World Engine&quot;, as well as a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L turbocharged diesel ([[Unit injector|Pumpe-Düse]]) made by [[Volkswagen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2008-2014allpar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/avenger.html |title=2008-2014 Dodge Avenger cars |publisher=AllPar |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a 2008 model, the Dodge Avenger came to showrooms in February 2007.
[[File:Dodge Avenger rear 20080517.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]

Further cost savings were explored in the form of an extensive platform-sharing arrangement with Mitsubishi, which spawned the [[Dodge Caliber|Caliber]] subcompact as a replacement for the Neon, and the [[Dodge Avenger|Avenger]] sedan. The rear-drive chassis was then used in early 2008 to build a new [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]], with styling reminiscent of the original 1970 Challenger. Like its predecessor, the new Challenger coupe was available with a V8 engine (base models featured a V6). In Spring 2007, [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]] reached an agreement with [[Cerberus Capital Management]] to sell its Chrysler Group subsidiary, of which the Dodge division was a part. Soon after, the housing bubble began to collapse the American market, and on May 1, 2009, Chrysler and GM filed for bankruptcy on the same day.

===Fiat ownership===
On June 10, 2009, Italian automaker [[Fiat]] formed a partnership with Chrysler under [[Sergio Marchionne]], with the UAW, and the US Government to form Chrysler Group LLC, of which Dodge remained fully integrated. For its part, the US Government provided more than $6 billion in loans at 21%, called a &quot;bridge loan&quot; or &quot;bailout&quot;. The newly formed company went on to fully repay that loan, remortgaging to reduce the interest rate several times down to 6%. They fully paid back the loan with interest to the U.S. Government on May 24, 2011, a full five years early. The UAW, being partners throughout the process, were paid well and above $3.9 billion in 2013 as Sergio's plan for full consolidation has continued on schedule. This has allowed Chrysler LLC to fully merge with Fiat to form FCA, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]], in 2014. The combined company will be based in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebhardt |first1=Tommaso |last2=Clothier |first2=Mark |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-08/marchionne-says-london-to-have-fiat-chrysler-headquarters.html |title=Marchionne Says London to Have Fiat Chrysler Headquarters |publisher=Bloomberg |date=May 9, 2014 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Dodge reintroduced a compact car based on an [[Alfa Romeo]] design called the Dart. It was the first new Dodge model produced under FCA.

On May 6, 2014, FCA announced a major restructuring, in which Dodge would focus solely on performance vehicles and will be positioned between [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] (which is moving downmarket into mainstream vehicles) and a relaunched [[Alfa Romeo]] (making its return to North America after a 20-year absence) in the FCA lineup. This is a set up similar to [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]], which positions [[Peugeot]] as its mainstream brand while [[Citroën]] is more performance-based, as well as [[Hyundai Motor Group]] having its two mainstream brands, [[Kia Motors]] and [[Hyundai Motor Company]] focusing on performance and mid-luxury, respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} (Among the American press, it has drawn comparisons to the decades-long set up of [[Chevrolet]] and [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] at [[General Motors]] before the phase-out of Pontiac in 2010.) As part of the restructuring, Dodge will discontinue the [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]] (after 32 years) and [[Dodge Avenger]] without replacements, while launching a sporty [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] below the Dart in 2018. Additionally, while the [[Ram Trucks]] division will remain separate (although the [[Dodge Durango]] will remain in production as a Dodge), the [[Street &amp; Racing Technology|SRT]] division was merged back into Dodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jerry |last1=Hirsh |first2=David |last2=Unredcoffler |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-chrysler-revamp-20140507-story.html#page=1 |title=Fiat Chrysler unveils aggressive five-year plan |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2020, FCA announced that Dodge will shift its focus to a performance marquee offering three core brands, Charger, Challenger, and Durango, starting with the 2021 model year. Both the Journey and Grand Caravan were discontinued with the 2020 model year models.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33247651/dodge-journey-grand-caravan-killed/ “Dodge Journey and Grand Caravan Are Both History after 2020”] from Car and Driver (July 8, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the decades, Dodge has become well known for its passenger car output, along with its many truck models, but after almost a century of manufacturing these vehicles, a decision was made to spin off Dodge's trucks into a separate [[Ram (brand)|Ram]] brand, based on the popularity of their top-selling truck, the [[Dodge Ram]]. Although the Ram trucks are marketed separately from Dodge cars, Ram President Fred Diaz has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ram trucks will always and forever be Dodges. Ram will always have the Dodge emblem inside and outside and they will be ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'vinned'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (from the acronym [[VIN]], or Vehicle Identification Number) as a Dodge. We need to continue to market as Ram so Dodge can have a different brand identity: hip, cool, young, energetic. That will not fit the campaign for truck buyers. The two should have distinct themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.pickuptrucks.com/2010/01/ram-trucks-will-always-be-dodges-ram-president-says.html|title=Ram Trucks Will Always Be Dodges, Ram President Says - PickupTrucks.com News |website=news.pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=May 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pickups and medium to heavy trucks===
[[File:1934 Dodge Brothers 2-ton stake truck red.jpg|thumb|right|1934 Dodge K-34 stake bed truck]]
Ever since Dodge began building their own cars in 1914, the company also offered light truck models. Initially, these were largely based on the existing passenger cars, but eventually gained their own chassis and body designs as the market matured. During the 1930s and 1940s, light- and medium-duty models were offered at first, then a heavy-duty range was added. The very large, new [[Warren Truck Assembly]] plant was built in Michigan, just north of Detroit, and opened in 1938, producing Dodge trucks ever since.

In 1936, Dodge's light, car-based trucks were crucially redesigned—not only receiving a new &quot;Fore-Point&quot; (similar to Cab Forward) design of the front side and cab—but especially, the old car frames were dropped and for the first time replaced by modern, truck-style chassis, with side rails ''welded'' to the cross members.&lt;ref name=AllparRam /&gt; These welded frames were from here on introduced on half-ton to one-ton rated trucks, expanding Dodge into a heavier truck market segment than before.

In 1939 again, Dodge presented a completely redesigned [[Dodge T-, V-, W-Series|line of pickups and trucks]], with streamlined new, 'art-deco' front sheetmetal styling. Introducing the concept of &quot;Job-Rated&quot;, Dodge tried to offer customers the truck that fit every job they were buying it for.&lt;ref name=AllparRam&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allpar.com/model/ram/ram-history.html |title=History of the Dodge Pickup Trucks, 1921-1953 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Allpar |access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1939 'Job-Rated' trucks onwards, Dodge's light and medium trucks were built in its 'Mound Road&quot; plant in Warren, Michigan.

Following [[World War II]] and the successful application of [[four-wheel drive]] to the truck line, Dodge introduced a civilian version that it called the [[Dodge Power Wagon|Power Wagon]]. At first based almost exactly on the military-type design, variants of the standard truck line were eventually given 4WD and the same &quot;Power Wagon&quot; name.

Dodge was among the first to introduce car-like features to its trucks, adding the plush Adventurer package during the 1960s and offering sedan-like space in its Club Cab bodies of the 1970s. Declining sales and increased competition during the 1970s eventually forced the company to drop its medium- and heavy-duty models, an arena the company has only recently begun to reenter.

Dodge introduced what they called the &quot;Adult Toys&quot; line to boost its truck sales in the late 1970s, starting off with the limited edition Lil' Red Express pickup (featuring, a 360 c.i. police interceptor engine and visible [[semi-trailer truck|big rig]]-style [[exhaust system|exhaust]] stacks). Later came the more widely available [[Dodge Warlock|Warlock]]. Other &quot;Adult Toys&quot; from Dodge included the &quot;Macho Power Wagon&quot; and &quot;Street Van&quot;.

As part of a general decline in the commercial vehicle field during the 1970s, Dodge eliminated their [[Dodge LCF Series|LCF Series]] heavy-duty trucks in 1975, along with the Bighorn and medium-duty D-Series trucks, and affiliated S Series [[school bus]]es were dropped in 1978. On the other hand, Dodge produced several thousand pickups for the [[United States armed forces|United States Military]] under the [[Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle|CUCV]] program from the late 1970s into the early 1980s.

[[File:89RamF34.jpg|thumb|1989 Dodge Ram pickup]]
Continuing financial problems meant that even Dodge's light-duty models – renamed as the [[Dodge Ram|Ram Pickup]] line for 1981 – were carried over with the most minimal of updates until 1993. Two things helped to revitalize Dodge's fortunes during this time. One was the introduction of [[Cummins]]' powerful and reliable [[Cummins B Series engine|B Series]] turbo-[[diesel engine]] as an option for 1989. This innovation raised Dodge's profile among consumers who needed power for towing or large loads. The second was a class-exclusive V8 engine option for the mid-sized [[Dodge Dakota|Dakota]] pickup.

Dodge introduced the Ram's all-new &quot;big-rig&quot; styling treatment for 1994. Besides its instantly [[Attitude polarization|polarizing]] looks, exposure was also gained by usage of the new truck on the hit TV show ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' starring [[Chuck Norris]]. The new Ram also featured a totally new interior with a console box big enough to hold a laptop computer, and ventilation and radio controls that were designed to be easily used even with gloves on. A V10 engine derived from that used in the Viper sports car was also new, and the previously offered Cummins [[turbodiesel]] remained available. The smaller Dakota was redesigned for 1997 using the big rig styling, thus giving Dodge trucks a definitive &quot;face&quot; that set them apart from the competition.

The Ram was redesigned again for 2002, and the Dakota in 2005, and was basically an evolution of the original, but adding the Hemi V8 engine to the list of available options, due to the revival of the legendary Chrysler Hemi V8 engine. New medium duty chassis cab models were introduced for 2007 with standard Cummins turbodiesel power as a way of gradually getting Dodge back into the business truck market again.

For a time during the 1980s, Dodge imported a line of small pickups from Mitsubishi, known as the D50, or later the [[Dodge Ram 50|Ram 50]] and were carried on as a stopgap until the Dakota's sales eventually made the imported trucks irrelevant. Reversing the role, Mitsubishi has more recently purchased Dakota pickups from Dodge and restyled them into their own [[Mitsubishi Raider|Raider]] line for sale in North America.

===Vans===
Dodge had offered panel delivery models for many years since its founding, but their first purpose-built van model arrived for 1964 with the compact [[Dodge A100|A Series]]. Based on the Dodge Dart platform and using its proven six-cylinder or V8 engines, the A-series was a strong competitor for both its domestic rivals (from Ford and Chevrolet/[[GMC Truck|GMC]]) and the diminutive [[Volkswagen Transporter]] line.

As the market evolved, Dodge realized that a bigger and stronger van line would be needed in the future, and thus the [[Dodge B Series|B Series]] was introduced for 1971, and offered both car-like comfort in its Sportsman passenger line or expansive room for gear and materials in its Tradesman cargo line. A chassis cab version was also offered for use with bigger cargo boxes or flatbeds. Like the trucks, Chrysler's dire financial straits of the late 1970s precluded any major updates for the vans for many years. Rebadged as the [[Dodge Ram Van|Ram Van]] and [[Dodge Ram Wagon|Ram Wagon]] for 1981, this old design carried on for 33 years with little more than cosmetic and safety updates all the way to 2003.
[[File:2001-2004 Dodge Grand Caravan.jpg|thumb|right|2001–2004 [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]]]]

The DaimlerChrysler merger of 1998 made it possible for Dodge to explore new ideas; hence the European-styled [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] line of vans was brought over and given a Dodge styling treatment. Redesigned for 2006 as a 2007 model, the economical diesel-powered Sprinters have become very popular for city usage among delivery companies like [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] in recent years. Because of their fuel efficiency major motorhome manufacturer Thor Motor Coach made several Class C and Class A [[Motorhomes]] available on the Dodge Sprinter Chassis including their popular Four Winds Siesta &amp; Chateau Citation product lines.

Dodge also offered a cargo version of its best-selling Caravan for many years, at first calling it the Mini Ram Van, which was a name originally applied to the short-wheelbase B Series Ram Vans, and later naming it the Caravan C/V, the C/V stood for Cargo Van. For model year 2012, the Caravan C/V was rebranded as a Ram, and was renamed the Ram C/V.

The Grand Caravan became Dodge’s last minivan, as it was discontinued after the 2020 model year in order to introduce the Chrysler Voyager for the 2021 model year.

===Sport utility vehicles===
Dodge's first experiments with anything like a sport utility vehicle appeared in the late 1950s with a windowed version of their standard panel-truck – known as the [[Dodge Town Wagon|Town Wagon]]. These were built in the same style through the mid-1960s.

But the division did not enter the SUV arena in earnest until 1974, with the purpose-built [[Dodge Ramcharger|Ramcharger]]. Offering the then-popular open body style and Dodge's powerful V8 engines, the Ramcharger was a strong competitor for trucks like the [[Ford Bronco]], [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[International Harvester Scout]] II.

Once again, though, Dodge was left with outdated products during the 1980s as the market evolved. The Ramcharger hung on through 1993 with only minor updates. When the Ram truck was redesigned for the 1994 model year, the Ramcharger was discontinued in the American and Canadian markets. A version using the updated styling was made for the Mexican Market but was never imported to the U.S. or Canada.

Instead, Dodge tried something new in 1997. Using the mid-sized Dakota pickup's chassis as a base, they built the four-door [[Dodge Durango|Durango]] SUV with seating for eight people and created a new niche. Sized between smaller SUVs (like the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[Ford Explorer]]) and larger models (like the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Ford Expedition]]), Durango was both a bit more and bit less{{original research inline|date=May 2012}} of everything. The redesigned version for 2004 grew a little bit in every dimension, becoming a full-size SUV (and thus somewhat less efficient), but was still sized between most of its competitors on either side of the aisle. For 2011 a new unibody Durango based on the Jeep Grand Cherokee was released. The 2011 Durango shrank slightly to size comparable to the original model. With the Journey being discontinued in 2020, the Durango became the only SUV offering in the Dodge lineup.

Dodge also imported a version of Mitsubishi's popular Montero ([[Mitsubishi Pajero|Pajero]] in Japan) as the [[Dodge Raider|Raider]] from 1987 to 1989.

=== High performance vehicles ===
From the late 20th century onwards, Dodge's highest performing vehicles fell under the category [[Street &amp; Racing Technology|SRT]]. These models often came equipped with high performance V8s under the hood. These models included the [[Dodge Challenger]] SRT (2008–current), [[Dodge Charger]] SRT (2006–current), [[Dodge Magnum]] SRT (2006–2008) and [[Dodge Durango]] SRT (2018-current-). They also produced the [[Dodge Neon SRT-4]] (2003–2005), [[Dodge Caliber]] SRT-4 (2008–2009), [[Dodge Viper]] (1991–2010; 2012–2017), and [[Dodge Ram SRT-10]] (2004–2006). In 2015, [[Chrysler|FCA]] introduced the [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hellcat|Hellcat]], a 707 HP, [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 6.2&amp;nbsp;L [[Hemispherical combustion chamber|HEMI]] [[V8 engine|V8]]. In 2017, Dodge released the [[Dodge Challenger]] Demon. It is powered by an 840 HP [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 6.2&amp;nbsp;L HEMI [[V8 engine|V8]], and comes from the factory with a toolbox known as the &quot;Demon Toolbox&quot; that has everything a buyer will need to drag race, including the skinny front drag tires. However, buyers will only get 840 HP on race fuel. On regular pump gas, it produces 808 HP, a 101 HP increase over the Hellcat.

==International markets==
===Argentina===
[[File:Dodge Polara (Argentina).jpg|thumb|right|An Argentine Dodge Polara, produced from 1968 to 1980]]

Dodge came to Argentina in the early 20th century with imported cars and trucks. In 1960, it partnered with Fevre-Basset as a local manufacturer. The first vehicle made in Argentina was the D-100 &quot;Sweptline&quot; pickup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_pick_up.htm#sweptile |title=Dodge Sweptline |publisher=Coche Argentino |language=es |accessdate=August 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821234742/http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_pick_up.htm#sweptile |archive-date=August 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1961 and 1980, a variety of trucks were produced, including the D-400/DP-400,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-ddp-400.html |title=Camión Argentino: Dodge D/DP-400 |work=camionargentino |date=September 6, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2016/02/dodge-d-500-4x4.html |title=Camión Argentino: Dodge D-500 4x4|first=Matias|last=Lerch|date=February 24, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;/DP-500,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-ddp-500.html |title=Camión Argentino: Dodge D/DP-500 |work=camionargentino |date=March 22, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; DP600,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/06/dodge-dp-600.html |title=Camión Argentino: Dodge DP-600 |work=camionargentino |date=March 12, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; DD900&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-dd-900.html |title=Camión Argentino: Dodge DD-900 |work=camionargentino |date=September 16, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DD1000 (the last two with one curiosity: the air-cooled [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] engine rather Perkins or Chrysler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/08/dodge-dd-1000.html |title=Camión Argentino: Dodge DD-1000 |work=camionargentino |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Passenger cars were also produced, namely the [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant I and II]], and the local versions of the 1966 [[Dodge Dart]] (called Valiant III and IV). In 1971, the Dodge 1500, a rebadged [[Hillman Avenger]] from the United Kingdom was introduced. In 1982, production of Dodge vehicles ceased when German company [[Volkswagen]] bought the Fevre plant and the shares.

In Argentina, the name &quot;Polara&quot; was used to refer to a series of vehicles developed on the basis of the fourth generation North American [[Dodge Dart#1967–1969|Dodge Dart]]. These cars were manufactured between 1968 and 1980, by the subsidiary Chrysler-Fevre Argentina S.A.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chrysler Argentina &quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm |title=Chrysler Argentina S.A., Dodge Coronado and Polara specifications |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111115144202/http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm |date=May 18, 2009 |language=es |archive-date=November 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Dodge began marketing cars and pick-ups directly in Argentina. Currently, both the Journey and the Ram are available to Argentine customers.

===Asia===
Dodge entered the Japanese market in mid-2007, and re-entered the Chinese market in late 2007. [[Soueast Motors]] of China assembles the Caravan for the Chinese market. Dodge began marketing its vehicles in South Korea in 2004, starting with the Dakota.

Dodge re-entered the Australian market in 2006 with the [[Dodge Caliber|Caliber]], their first offering since the AT4/D5N trucks in 1979 and the first Dodge passenger car to be marketed in Australia since the [[Dodge Phoenix|Phoenix]] sedan was discontinued in 1973. The second model to be introduced was the [[Dodge Nitro|Nitro]], with the [[Dodge Avenger|Avenger]] and [[Dodge Journey|Journey]] followed. Dodge chose not use the full model lines and engines available to them, the 2.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 being available in the Journey and Avenger instead of the 3.2&amp;nbsp;L in the North American versions. However, diesel engines were introduced in all their cars.
Following the Global Financial Crisis, Chrysler introduced the facelifted model of the Caliber and discontinued the Avenger imports. From early 2012 on, model year 2010 cars were available. By early 2012 no new cars were being brought into Australia aside from the new facelifted 2012 Journey.

There were rumors that Dodge cars will be re-badged as Fiats in the Australian market as was the case in Europe. The Dodge nameplate continued due to consistent sales of the Journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bruce |last=Newton |url= http://www.carpoint.com.au/news/2012/fiat-punto-heading-back-to-australia-32839 |title=Fiat Punto heading back to Australia |publisher=carpoint.com.au |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the brand was discontinued in the Australian market after 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Maclean |first=Andrew |title=Dodge brand dropped from Australia - Dodge disappears from Australia |url=https://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/dodge-brand-dropped-from-australia-20161014-gs2od1 |website=Drive |accessdate=6 December 2019 |language=en-au |date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In Brazil, Dodge cars were produced between 1969 and 1981 with the models Dart, Charger, Magnum, LeBaron (all powered by the same 318&amp;nbsp;cid V8 engine), and the compact 1800/Polara, based on the British [[Hillman Avenger]]. The manufacturer was acquired by Volkswagen in 1981. In 1998, the Dakota pickup started production in a new plant in [[Campo Largo, Paraná]] by [[Mercedes-Benz]], which belongs to its former partner [[Daimler AG]]. It was built there until 2001 with petrol and diesel engines and regular, extended and crew cabs. In 2010, Dodge started sales of the imported pickup Ram 2500. The model portfolio is being expanded, starting with the Journey crossover for the 2009 model year.

===Canada===
In Canada, the Dodge lineup of cars started down the road to elimination along with the Plymouth line when in 1988 the [[Dodge Dynasty]] was sold in Canada as the Chrysler Dynasty and sold at both Plymouth and Dodge dealers. Similarly, the new [[Dodge Intrepid]], the Dynasty's replacement, was sold as the Chrysler Intrepid.

For 2000, the new Neon became the Chrysler Neon. The Chrysler Cirrus and Mitsubishi-built Dodge Avenger were dropped. Dodge trucks, which have been sold at Canadian Plymouth dealers since 1973, continued without change. All Plymouth-Chrysler and Dodge-Chrysler dealers became Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep dealers.

The diluting of the Chrysler name did not go well in Canada, especially as the nameplate had been pushed as a luxury line since the 1930s. For 2003, the revamped Neon appeared in Canada as the Dodge SX 2.0. Since then, all new Dodge models have been sold in Canada under the Dodge name.

===Europe===
Dodge started assembling lorries (trucks) in the United Kingdom from imported parts in 1922. In 1933 it began to manufacture a British chassis at its works in [[Kew]], using American engines and gearboxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=doctor colin |url= http://www.dodge50.co.uk/dodgehistory.htm |title=1922 To 1983 a brief history of Dodge in the U.K. |publisher=Dodge50.co.uk |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

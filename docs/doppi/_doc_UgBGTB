==Reactions==
Featuring sulfur in the +4 oxidation state, sulfur dioxide is a [[reducing agent]].  It is oxidized by halogens to give the sulfuryl halides, such as [[sulfuryl chloride]]:
: SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Sulfur dioxide is the [[oxidising agent]] in the [[Claus process]], which is conducted on a large scale in [[oil refineries]].  Here, sulfur dioxide is reduced by hydrogen sulfide to give elemental sulfur:

: SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → 3 S + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The sequential oxidation of sulfur dioxide followed by its hydration is used in the production of sulfuric acid.
: 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

===Laboratory reactions===
Sulfur dioxide is one of the few common acidic yet reducing gases. It turns moist litmus pink (being acidic), then white (due to its bleaching effect). It may be identified by bubbling it through a [[dichromate]] solution, turning the solution from orange to green (Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq)). It can also reduce ferric ions to ferrous.&lt;ref name=Lucas &gt;http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2017/rncan-nrcan/M34-20/M34-20-107-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur dioxide can react with certain 1,3-[[diene]]s in a [[cheletropic reaction]] to form cyclic [[sulfone]]s. This reaction is exploited on an industrial scale for the synthesis of [[sulfolane]], which is an important solvent in the [[petrochemical industry]].

: [[File:Cheletropic reaction of butadiene with SO2.svg|frameless|upright=0.7]]

Sulfur dioxide can bind to metal ions as a [[ligand]] to form [[metal sulfur dioxide complex]]es, typically where the transition metal is in oxidation state 0 or +1.  Many different bonding modes (geometries) are recognized, but in most cases, the ligand is monodentate, attached to the metal through sulfur, which can be either planar and pyramidal [[hapticity|η]]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a η&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  (S-bonded planar) ligand sulfur dioxide functions as a Lewis base using the lone pair on S. SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; functions as a [[Lewis acids]] in its  η&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (S-bonded pyramidal) bonding mode with metals and in its 1:1 [[adducts]] with Lewis bases such as [[dimethylacetamide]] and [[trimethyl amine]].  When bonding to Lewis bases  the [[ ECW model|acid parameters]] of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are E&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.51 and E&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.56.

==Uses==
The overarching, dominant use of sulfur dioxide is in the production of sulfuric acid.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

===Precursor to sulfuric acid===
Sulfur dioxide is an intermediate in the production of sulfuric acid, being converted to [[sulfur trioxide]], and then to [[oleum]], which is made into sulfuric acid. Sulfur dioxide for this purpose is made when sulfur combines with oxygen. The method of converting sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid is called the [[contact process]]. Several billion kilograms are produced annually for this purpose.

===As a preservative===
Sulfur dioxide is sometimes used as a [[preservative]] for dried [[apricot]]s, dried [[common fig|figs]], and other [[dried fruit]]s, owing to its [[antimicrobial]] properties and ability to prevent [[oxidation]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipen.br/biblioteca/2011/inac/17204.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and is called [[E number|E]]220&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist#h_3 Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers], The Food Standards Agency website.&lt;/ref&gt; when used in this way in Europe.  As a preservative, it maintains the colorful appearance of the fruit and prevents [[Decomposition|rotting]]. It is also added to sulfured [[molasses]].

Sulfur dioxide was first used in [[winemaking]] by the Romans, when they discovered that burning sulfur candles inside empty wine vessels keeps them fresh and free from vinegar smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb09/page1.htm|publisher=www.practicalwinery.com|date=1 Feb 2009|title=Practical Winery &amp; vineyard Journal Jan/Feb 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928111625/http://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb09/page1.htm|archive-date=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is still an important compound in winemaking, and is measured in [[parts per million]] (''ppm'') in wine. It is present even in so-called unsulfurated wine at concentrations of up to 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morethanorganic.com/sulphur-in-the-bottle Sulphites in wine], MoreThanOrganic.com.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as an [[antibiotic]] and [[antioxidant]], protecting wine from spoilage by bacteria and oxidation - a phenomenon that leads to the browning of the wine and a loss of cultivar specific flavors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson&quot;&gt;Jackson, R.S. (2008) Wine science: principles and applications, Amsterdam; Boston: Elsevier/Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guerrero&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tifs.2014.11.004| title = Demonstrating the efficiency of sulphur dioxide replacements in wine: A parameter review| journal = Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology| volume = 42| pages = 27–43| year = 2015| last1 = Guerrero| first1 = Raúl F| last2 = Cantos-Villar| first2 = Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its antimicrobial action also helps minimize volatile acidity. Wines containing sulfur dioxide are typically labeled with &quot;containing [[sulfite]]s&quot;.

Sulfur dioxide exists in wine in free and bound forms, and the combinations are referred to as total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Binding, for instance to the carbonyl group of [[acetaldehyde]], varies with the wine in question. The free form exists in equilibrium between molecular SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion, which is in turn in equilibrium with sulfite ion. These equilibria depend on the pH of the wine. Lower pH shifts the equilibrium towards molecular (gaseous) SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the active form, while at higher pH more SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is found in the inactive sulfite and bisulfite forms. The molecular SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is active as an antimicrobial and antioxidant, and this is also the form which may be perceived as a pungent odor at high levels. Wines with total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations below 10 ppm do not require &quot;contains sulfites&quot; on the label by US and EU laws.  The upper limit of total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allowed in wine in the US is 350 ppm; in the EU it is 160 ppm for red wines and 210 ppm for white and rosé wines. In low concentrations, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations over 50 ppm, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; becomes evident in the smell and taste of wine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also a very important compound in winery sanitation.  Wineries and equipment must be kept clean, and because bleach cannot be used in a winery due to the risk of [[cork taint]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FS/FS-50-W.pdf Chlorine Use in the Winery]. Purdue University&lt;/ref&gt; a mixture of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, water, and citric acid is commonly used to clean and sanitize equipment. [[Ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is now used extensively for sanitizing in wineries due to its efficacy, and because it does not affect the wine or most equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb00/ozone.htm Use of ozone for winery and environmental sanitation], Practical Winery &amp; Vineyard Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a reducing agent===
Sulfur dioxide is also a good [[Reducing agent|reductant]]. In the presence of water, sulfur dioxide is able to decolorize substances.  Specifically, it is a useful reducing [[bleach]] for [[paper]]s and delicate materials such as clothes.  This bleaching effect normally does not last very long. [[Oxygen]] in the atmosphere reoxidizes the reduced dyes, restoring the color.  In municipal wastewater treatment, sulfur dioxide is used to treat chlorinated wastewater prior to release.  Sulfur dioxide reduces free and combined chlorine to [[chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tchobanoglous |first=George |title=Wastewater Engineering |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=1979 |isbn=0-07-041677-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur dioxide is fairly soluble in water, and by both IR and Raman spectroscopy; the hypothetical sulfurous acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is not present to any extent.  However, such solutions do show spectra of the hydrogen sulfite ion, HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, by reaction with water, and it is in fact the actual reducing agent present:
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ⇌ HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

===Biochemical and biomedical roles===
Sulfur dioxide or its conjugate base bisulfite is produced biologically as an intermediate in both sulfate-reducing organisms and in sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, as well. The role of sulfur dioxide in mammalian biology is not yet well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=D. |url=http://benthamscience.com/mrmc/contabs/mrmc10-11.html#4 |title=Sulfur dioxide: a novel gaseous signal in the regulation of cardiovascular functions |journal=Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=1039–1045 |pmid=20540708 |last2=Jin |first2=H |last3=Tang |first3=C |last4=Du |first4=J |doi=10.2174/1389557511009011039 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426082343/http://benthamscience.com/mrmc/contabs/mrmc10-11.html#4 |archive-date=2013-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sulfur dioxide blocks nerve signals from the [[pulmonary stretch receptors]] and abolishes the [[Hering–Breuer reflex|Hering–Breuer inflation reflex]].

It is considered that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a significant physiological role in regulating [[cardiac]] and [[blood vessel]] function, and aberrant or deficient sulfur dioxide metabolism can contribute to several different cardiovascular diseases, such as [[arterial hypertension]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]], and [[stenocardia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tian H.|title=Advances in the study on endogenous sulfur dioxide in the cardiovascular system.|journal=Chin Med J|date=Nov 2014|volume=127|issue=21|pages=3803–3807|pmid=25382339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was shown that in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart diseases the level of [[homocysteine]] is higher and the level of endogenous sulfur dioxide is lower than in normal control children. Moreover, these biochemical parameters strongly correlated to the severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Authors considered homocysteine to be one of useful biochemical markers of disease severity and sulfur dioxide metabolism to be one of potential therapeutic targets in those patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yang R, Yang Y, Dong X, Wu X, Wei Y |title=Correlation between endogenous sulfur dioxide and homocysteine in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease|language=zh|journal=Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi|date=Aug 2014|volume=52|issue=8|pages=625–629|pmid=25224243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous sulfur dioxide also has been shown to lower the [[Cell proliferation|proliferation]] rate of endothelial [[smooth muscle]] cells in blood vessels, via lowering the [[MAPK]] activity and activating [[adenylyl cyclase]] and [[protein kinase A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liu D, Huang Y, Bu D, Liu AD, Holmberg L, Jia Y, Tang C, Du J, Jin H |title=Sulfur dioxide inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via suppressing the Erk/MAP kinase pathway mediated by cAMP/PKA signaling|journal=Cell Death Dis.|date=May 2014|volume=5|issue=5|pages=e1251|doi=10.1038/cddis.2014.229|pmid=24853429|pmc=4047873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth muscle cell proliferation is one of important mechanisms of hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels and their [[stenosis]], so it is an important pathogenetic mechanism in arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis.

Endogenous sulfur dioxide in low concentrations causes endothelium-dependent [[vasodilation]]. In higher concentrations it causes endothelium-independent vasodilation and has a negative inotropic effect on cardiac output function, thus effectively lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption. The vasodilating and bronchodilating effects of sulfur dioxide are mediated via ATP-dependent [[calcium channel]]s and L-type (&quot;dihydropyridine&quot;) calcium channels. Endogenous sulfur dioxide is also a potent antiinflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective agent. It lowers blood pressure and slows hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels, especially thickening of their intima. It also regulates lipid metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang XB, Jin HF, Tang CS, Du JB |title=The biological effect of endogenous sulfur dioxide in the cardiovascular system.|journal=Eur J Pharmacol|date=16 Nov 2011|volume=670|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.08.031|pmid=21925165|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous sulfur dioxide also diminishes myocardial damage, caused by [[isoproterenol]] [[adrenergic]] hyperstimulation, and strengthens the myocardial antioxidant defense reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liang Y, Liu D, Ochs T, Tang C, Chen S, Zhang S, Geng B, Jin H, Du J |title=Endogenous sulfur dioxide protects against isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury and increases myocardial antioxidant capacity in rats.|journal=Lab.

===As a reagent and solvent in the laboratory===
Sulfur dioxide is a versatile inert solvent widely used for dissolving highly oxidizing salts.  It is also used occasionally as a source of the sulfonyl group in [[organic synthesis]].  Treatment of aryl [[diazonium salt]]s with sulfur dioxide and [[cuprous chloride]] yields the corresponding aryl sulfonyl chloride, for example:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Hoffman, R. V. | title = m-Trifluoromethylbenzenesulfonyl Chloride | collvol = 7 | collvolpages = 508 | year = 1990| prep = CV7P0508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:Preparation of m-trifluoromethylbenzenesulfonyl chloride.svg|frameless|upright=2]]

As a result of its very low [[Lewis basicity]], it is often used as a low-temperature solvent/diluent for superacids like [[Magic acid]] (FSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H/SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), allowing for highly reactive species like ''tert''-butyl cation to be observed spectroscopically at low temperature (though tertiary carbocations do react with SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; above about –30&amp;nbsp;°C, and even less reactive solvents like [[Sulfuryl chloride fluoride|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ClF]] must be used at these higher temperatures).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Olah|first1=George A.|last2=Lukas|first2=Joachim.|date=1967-08-01|title=Stable carbonium ions.

===Aspirational applications===

====As a refrigerant====
Being easily condensed and possessing a high [[heat of evaporation]], sulfur dioxide is a candidate material for refrigerants.  Prior to the development of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, sulfur dioxide was used as a [[refrigerant]] in [[refrigeration#Home and consumer use|home refrigerators]].

==== Climate engineering ====
[[Stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|Injections of sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere]] has been proposed in [[climate engineering]]. The cooling effect would be similar to what has been observed after the large explosive [[1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo]]. However this form of geoengineering would have uncertain regional consequences on rainfall patterns, for example in [[monsoon]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke L., K. Jiang, K. Akimoto, M. Babiker, G.

Sulfur dioxide is a major air pollutant and has significant impacts upon human health.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA&quot;&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/so2-pollution Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Pollution]. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere can influence the habitat suitability for plant communities, as well as animal life.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. Michael (2010). [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 &quot;Abiotic factor&quot;] in ''Encyclopedia of Earth''. Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland (eds.). National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfur dioxide emissions are a precursor to [[acid rain]] and atmospheric particulates. Due largely to the [[United States|US]] EPA's [[Acid Rain Program]], the U.S. has had a 33% decrease in emissions between 1983 and 2002.  This improvement resulted in part from [[flue-gas desulfurization]], a technology that enables SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be chemically bound in [[power plant]]s burning sulfur-containing [[coal]] or [[Petroleum|oil]]. In particular, [[calcium oxide|calcium oxide (lime)]] reacts with sulfur dioxide to form [[calcium sulfite]]:

: CaO + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; →  CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Aerobic oxidation of the CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, [[anhydrite]].  Most gypsum sold in Europe comes from flue-gas desulfurization.

Sulfur can be removed from coal during burning by using limestone as a bed material in [[fluidized bed combustion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindeburg |first=Michael R. |title=Mechanical Engineering Reference Manual for the PE Exam |location=Belmont, C.A. |publisher=Professional Publications, Inc |year=2006 |pages=27–3 |isbn=978-1-59126-049-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur can also be removed from fuels before burning, preventing formation of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when the fuel is burnt. The [[Claus process]] is used in refineries to produce sulfur as a byproduct.  The [[Stretford process]] has also been used to remove sulfur from fuel. [[Redox]] processes using iron oxides can also be used, for example, Lo-Cat&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100304170107/http://www.gtp-merichem.com/support/index.php FAQ’s About Sulfur Removal and Recovery using the LO-CAT® Hydrogen Sulfide Removal System]. gtp-merichem.com&lt;/ref&gt; or Sulferox.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/gasification/pubs/pdf/SFA%20Pacific_Process%20Screening%20Analysis_Dec%202002.pdf Process screening analysis of alternative gas treating and sulfur removal for gasification].

Fuel additives such as [[calcium]] additives and magnesium carboxylate may be used in marine engines to lower the emission of sulfur dioxide gases into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;May, Walter R.  [http://www.fuelspec.com/library/Marine%20Emissions%20Abatement.pdf Marine Emissions Abatement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402130001/http://www.fuelspec.com/library/Marine%20Emissions%20Abatement.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}. SFA International, Inc., p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, [[China]] was the world's largest sulfur dioxide polluter, with 2005 emissions estimated to be {{convert|25,490,000|ST|Mt|sigfig=3}}. This amount represents a 27% increase since 2000, and is roughly comparable with U.S. emissions in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news78159898.html China has its worst spell of acid rain], [[United Press International]] (2006-09-22).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inhalation===
Incidental exposure to sulfur dioxide is routine, e.g. the smoke from matches, coal, and sulfur-containing fuels.

Sulfur dioxide is mildly toxic and can be hazardous in high concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/so2-pollution/ Sulfur Dioxide Basics] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term exposure to low concentrations is also problematic. A 2011 [[systematic review]] concluded that exposure to sulfur dioxide is associated with [[preterm birth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shah-2011&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Air pollution and birth outcomes: a systematic review | journal = Environ Int | volume = 37 | pages = 498–516 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1016/j.envint.2010.10.009 | pmid = 21112090 | author = Shah PS, Balkhair T, Knowledge Synthesis Group on Determinants of Preterm/LBW Births | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. regulations===
In 2008, the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] reduced the [[short-term exposure limit]] to 0.25 [[parts per million]] (ppm). In the US, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] set the [[Permissible exposure limit|PEL]] at 5 ppm (13 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) time-weighted average. Also in the US, [[NIOSH]]  set the [[IDLH]] at 100 ppm.&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0575.html |title=NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, the [[EPA]] &quot;revised the primary SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[NAAQS]] by establishing a new one-hour standard at a level of 75 [[parts per billion|parts per billion (ppb)]]. EPA revoked the two existing primary standards because they would not provide additional public health protection given a one-hour standard at 75 ppb.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA&quot; /&gt;

'''Italian [[neorealism (art)|neorealism]]''' ({{lang-it|Neorealismo}}), also known as the '''Golden Age''', is a national film movement characterized by stories set amongst the poor and the working class, filmed [[Location shooting|on location]], frequently using non-professional [[actor]]s. Italian neorealism films mostly contend with the difficult economic and moral conditions of [[Aftermath of World War II#Italy|post-World War II]] Italy, representing changes in the Italian psyche and conditions of [[everyday life]], including [[poverty]], [[oppression]], [[injustice]], and desperation.

=== Yakuza in society ===
The Yakuza have had mixed relations with Japanese society. Despite their pariah status, some of their actions may be perceived to have positive effects on society. For example, they stop other criminal organisations acting in their areas of operation. They have been known to provide relief in times of disaster. These actions have at times painted Yakuza in a fairly positive light within Japan. However, gang-wars, and the use of violence as a tool have caused their approval to fall with the general public.  See [[Murder of Junko Furuta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/09/where-have-japan-s-yakuza-gone | work=Daily Beast | title=Where Have Japan's Yakuza Gone?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===

The Yakuza have been in media and culture in many different fashions. Creating its own [[Yakuza film|genre]] of movies within Japan's film industry, the portrayal of the Yakuza mainly manifests in one of two archetypes; they are portrayed as either honorable and respectable men or as criminals who use fear and violence as their means of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://japantoday.com/category/features/opinions/yakuza-kind-hearted-criminals-or-monsters-in-suits | work=Japan Today | title=Yakuza: Kind-hearted criminals or monsters in suits? | date=10 October 2012 | accessdate=18 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Movies like ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity (film)|Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' and ''[[Dead or Alive (film)|Dead or Alive]]'' portray some of the members as violent criminals, with the focus being on the violence, while other movies focus more on the &quot;business&quot; side of the Yakuza.

The 1992 film ''[[Minbo]]'', a satirical view of Yakuza activities, resulted in retaliation against the director, as real-life Yakuza gangsters attacked the director [[Juzo Itami]] shortly after the release of the film.

Yakuza films have also been popular in the Western market with films such as the 1975 film ''[[The Yakuza]]'', the 1989 film ''[[Black Rain (1989 American film)|Black Rain]]'', the 2005 film ''[[Into the Sun (2005 film)|Into the Sun]]'', and the 2018 film, ''[[The Outsider (2018 film)|The Outsider]]''. These are some of the most striking Yakuza movies.

===Television===
The Yakuza make an appearance outside [[742 Evergreen Terrace]] in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', &quot;[[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]&quot;. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s fast food rivals ask the Yakuza to help shut down Marge's [[pretzel]] franchise, where they fight a [[Mafia]] family led by [[Fat Tony (The Simpsons)|Fat Tony]].

The Yakuza play a very important role in the ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' remake. Lead character [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Kono Kalakaua|Kono Kalakaua's]] husband [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Adam Noshimuri|Adam Noshimuri]] was the former head of the Yakuza who took over after his father Hiro Noshimuri died. Adam's brother [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Michael Nosimuri|Michael Noshimuri]] was also part of the Yakuza.

The Yakuza are also the basis for the 2019 BBC TV Series ''[[Giri/Haji]]'', which features a character whose life is put in danger after he comes under suspicion for a murder tied to the Yakuza.

The Yakuza were also a prominent force in the [[Amazon Prime]] series ''[[The Man In The High Castle]]''. They appeared in all four seasons of the series.

In the FXX adult animation series ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'', Pam Poovey, human resources director of the ISIS espionage agency, participates in competitive [[Drifting (motorsport)|drift]] races with the Yakuza. After the agency's dissolution, she falls afoul of the local Yakuza syndicate by paying for a large quantity of amphetamine pills with counterfeit currency.

=== Video games ===
The video game series ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'', launched in 2005, portrays the actions of several different ranking members of the Yakuza, as well as criminal associates such as dirty cops and loan sharks. The series addresses some of the same themes as the Yakuza genre of film does, like violence, honor, politics of the syndicates, and the social status of the Yakuza in Japan. The series has been successful, spawning sequels, spin-offs, a live action [[Like a Dragon|movie]], and a web TV series.

''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' features a Yakuza clan that assists the [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|protagonist]] in the second and third act after they cut their ties with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]]. The Yakuza derive most of their income from a casino, Kenji's, and are currently fighting to keep other gangs from peddling drugs in their territory while seeking to protect their activities from police interference. Towards the end of the third act, the player assassinates the leader of the clan, and the other members are later executed by Colombian gangsters.

''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'' features a mission set in Japan that sees Agent 47 assassinating the son of a wealthy arms dealer during his dinner meeting with a Yakuza boss at his private estate. A mission in a later game, ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', set at a secluded mountaintop hospital, features a notorious Yakuza lawyer and fixer as one of two targets to be assassinated.

=== Manga, anime and drama ===
* ''[[Gokusen]]'': [[manga]] (2000), drama (2002, 2005 and 2008) and [[anime]] (2004). The heiress of a clan becomes a teacher in a difficult high school, and is assigned a class of delinquents, the 3-D. She will teach them mathematics, while gradually getting involved in several other levels, going so far as to get her students out of a bad situation by sometimes using her skills as heir to the clan.
* ''[[My Boss My Hero]]'': [[Film stock]] (2001), drama (2002). A young gang leader, who seems to be too stupid to do his job, misses a big deal because he can't count correctly, and on the other hand is practically illiterate. In order to access the succession of the clan, his father then forces him to return to high school, to obtain his diploma. He must not reveal his membership in the yakuza, under penalty of being immediately excluded.
* ''[[Twittering Birds Never Fly]]'': manga of the [[shōnen-ai]] genre (2011–?). Yashiro, a totally depraved masochist, boss of a yakuza clan and the Shinsei finance company, hires Chikara Dômeki, a secretive and not very talkative man, as his bodyguard. While Yashiro would like to take advantage of Dômeki's body, the latter is helpless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Serie –Twittering birds never fly|url=http://www.taifu-comics.com/index.php/serie/Twittering-birds-never-fly|website=taifu-comics.com|access-date=2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Like the Beast'': [[manga]], [[yaoi]] (2008). Tomoharu Ueda, a police officer in a small local post, meets Aki Gotôda, son of the leader of a Yakuza clan, in pursuit of an underwear thief. The next morning, Aki shows up at his house to thank him for his help and finds himself making a declaration of love for him. Taken aback, Ueda replies that it is better that they get to know each other, but that's without counting Aki's stubbornness, ready to do anything to achieve his ends.

Several [[manga]] by [[Ryoichi Ikegami]] are located in the middle of the Japanese underworld:
* ''[[Crying Freeman]]'' (1986).
* ''[[Sanctuary (manga)|Sanctuary]]'' (1990): Hôjô and Asami, childhood friends, have only one goal: to give the Japanese back a taste for life, and to shake up the country. For this, they decide to climb the ladder of power, one in the light, as a politician, the other in the shadows, as yakuza.
* ''[[Strain (manga)|Strain]]'' (1996).
* ''[[Heat (manga)|Heat]]'' (1999): Tatsumi Karasawa is the owner of a club in Tokyo who plans to expand his business. He gives a hard time not only to the police, but also to the yakuza, of which he manages, however, to rally a certain number at his side.

      <text bytes="4679" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|measure space where every subset of a set with null measure is measurable (and has null measure)}}
{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''complete measure''' (or, more precisely, a '''complete measure space''') is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure space]] in which every [[subset]] of every [[null set]] is measurable (having [[measure zero]]). More formally, a measure space (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;''μ'') is complete if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;S \subseteq N \in \Sigma \mbox{ and } \mu(N) = 0\ \Rightarrow\ S \in \Sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

==Motivation==
The need to consider questions of completeness can be illustrated by considering the problem of product spaces.

Suppose that we have already constructed [[Lebesgue measure]] on the [[real line]]: denote this measure space by ('''R''',&amp;nbsp;''B'',&amp;nbsp;''λ''). We now wish to construct some two-dimensional Lebesgue measure ''λ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as a [[product measure]]. Naively, we would take the [[sigma algebra|''&amp;sigma;''-algebra]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to be ''B''&amp;nbsp;⊗&amp;nbsp;''B'', the smallest ''σ''-algebra containing all measurable &quot;rectangles&quot; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B''.

While this approach does define a [[measure space]], it has a flaw. Since every [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] set has one-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero,

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^{2} ( \{ 0 \} \times A ) = \lambda ( \{ 0 \} ) \cdot \lambda (A) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for &quot;any&quot; subset ''A'' of '''R'''. However, suppose that ''A'' is a [[Non-measurable set|non-measurable subset]] of the real line, such as the [[Vitali set]]. Then the ''λ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-measure of {0}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''A'' is not defined, but

:&lt;math&gt;\{ 0 \} \times A \subseteq \{ 0 \} \times \mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt;

and this larger set does have ''λ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-measure zero. So, this &quot;two-dimensional Lebesgue measure&quot; as just defined is not complete, and some kind of completion procedure is required.

==Construction of a complete measure==
Given a (possibly incomplete) measure space (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;''μ''), there is an extension (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) of this measure space that is complete. The smallest such extension (i.e. the smallest ''σ''-algebra Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is called the '''completion''' of the measure space.

The completion can be constructed as follows:
* let ''Z'' be the set of all the subsets of the zero-''μ''-measure subsets of ''X'' (intuitively, those elements of ''Z'' that are not already in Σ are the ones preventing completeness from holding true);
* let Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be the ''σ''-algebra generated by Σ and ''Z'' (i.e. the smallest ''σ''-algebra that contains every element of Σ and of ''Z'');
* ''μ'' has an extension to Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (which is unique if ''μ'' is [[Σ-finite measure|''σ''-finite]]), called the [[outer measure]] of ''μ'', given by the [[infimum]]

::&lt;math&gt;\mu_{0} (C) := \inf \{ \mu (D) \mid C \subseteq D \in \Sigma \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is a complete measure space, and is the completion of (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;''μ'').

In the above construction it can be shown that every member of Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is of the form ''A''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''B'' for some ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Σ and some ''B''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''Z'', and

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{0} (A \cup B) = \mu (A).&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
* [[Borel measure]] as defined on the Borel ''σ''-algebra generated by the [[Open set|open]] [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]] of the real line is not complete, and so the above completion procedure must be used to define the complete Lebesgue measure. This is illustrated by the fact that the set of all Borel sets over the reals has the same cardinality as the reals. While the [[Cantor set]] is a Borel set, has measure zero, and its power set has cardinality strictly greater than that of the reals. Thus there is a subset of the Cantor set that is not contained in the Borel sets. Hence, the Borel measure is not complete.
* ''n''-dimensional Lebesgue measure is the completion of the ''n''-fold product of the one-dimensional Lebesgue space with itself. It is also the completion of the Borel measure, as in the one-dimensional case.

==Properties==
[[Maharam's theorem]] states that every complete measure space is decomposable into a measure on the [[continuum (set theory)|continuum]], and a finite or countable [[counting measure]].

Located on Sicily’s east coast, it faces the [[Ionian Sea]]. It is the capital of the 58-municipality region known as the [[Metropolitan City of Catania]], which is the seventh-largest metropolitan city in Italy. The population of the city proper is 311,584,&lt;ref name=istat/&gt; while the population of the [[Metropolitan City of Catania]] is 1,107,702.&lt;ref name=istat/&gt;

Catania was founded in the 8th century BC by Chalcidian Greeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;travelplan.it&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelplan.it/catania_guide_history_culture.htm |title=Catania history – Catania culture – Catania – attractions in Catania – art Catania – history guide Catania – Italy Katane |publisher=Travelplan.it |access-date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was almost completely destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake in [[1169 Sicily earthquake|1169]].&lt;ref name=&quot;travelplan.it&quot;/&gt;

However, by the 14th century, and into the [[Renaissance]] period, Catania was one of Italy's most important cultural, artistic and political centres.&lt;ref name=&quot;travelplan.it&quot;/&gt; It was the site of Sicily’s first [[University of Catania|university]], founded in 1434.&lt;ref name=&quot;travelplan.it&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelplan.it/catania_guide_history_culture.htm |title=Catania history – Catania culture – Catania – attractions in Catania – art Catania – history guide Catania – Italy Katane |publisher=Travelplan.it |access-date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the native or adopted home of some of Italy's most famous artists and writers, including the composers [[Vincenzo Bellini]] and [[Giovanni Pacini]], and the writers [[Giovanni Verga]], [[Luigi Capuana]], [[Federico De Roberto]] and [[Nino Martoglio]].

The city has been devastated several times by volcanic eruptions from nearby [[Mount Etna]], the most violent of which was in [[1669 Etna eruption|1669]] and it suffered through another severely damaging earthquake in [[1693 Sicily earthquake|1693]].&lt;ref name=&quot;travelplan.it&quot;/&gt;

Catania today is the industrial, logistical, and commercial center of Sicily. Its airport, the [[Catania-Fontanarossa Airport]], is the largest in Southern Italy. 

However, it is also noted for its [[history]], [[culture]], [[architecture]], and [[gastronomy]]. The section of the city known as the “old town” features some of the most striking examples of [[baroque architecture]] in Italy, and is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==Etymology==
The ancient [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous population]] of the [[Sicels]] named their villages after geographical attributes of their location. The Sicilian word, ''katane'', means &quot;grater, flaying knife, skinning place&quot; or a &quot;crude tool apt to pare&quot;. Other translations of the name are &quot;harsh lands&quot;, &quot;uneven ground&quot;, &quot;sharp stones&quot;, or &quot;rugged or rough soil&quot;. The latter etymologies are easily justifiable since, for many centuries following an eruption, the city has always been rebuilt within its black-lava landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sicilia.indettaglio.it/eng/comuni/ct/catania/catania.html |title=The meaning of the name Catania |publisher=Sicilia.indettaglio.it |date=4 November 2006 |access-date=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 263 BC, the city was variously known as ''Catĭna'' ({{IPA-la|ˈkatɪna|lang}}) and ''Catăna'' ({{IPA-la|ˈkatana|lang}}; {{lang-grc|Κατάνη}} {{IPA-el|katánɛː|}}).{{efn|Roman writers fluctuate between the two forms Catana and Catina, of which the latter is, perhaps, the most common, and is supported by inscriptions (Orell. 3708, 3778); but the analogy of the Greek {{lang|grc|Κατάνη}}, and the modern Catania, would point to the former as the more correct.}} The former has been primarily used for its supposed assonance with ''catina'', the Latin feminization of the name ''catinus''.&lt;ref&gt;Holm Adolf (1925), ''Catania Antica'', G. Libertini&lt;/ref&gt; ''Catinus'' has two meanings: &quot;a gulf, a basin or a bay&quot; and &quot;a bowl, a vessel or a trough&quot;,  thanks to the city's distinctive topography.

Around 900, when Catania was part of the [[emirate of Sicily]], it was known in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as ''Balad al-fīl'' ({{lang|ar|بلد الفيل}}) and ''Madīnat al-fīl'' ({{lang|ar|مدينة الفيل}}), respectively meaning &quot;the Village (or Country) of the Elephant&quot; and &quot;the City of the Elephant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Amari|first=Michele|title=Edrisi, Il Libro di Re Ruggero|language=it|volume=I|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elephant is the lava sculpture over the fountain in Piazza Duomo: most likely a prehistoric sculpture that was reforged during the Byzantine Era, it appears to be a talisman that was reputedly powerful enough to protect the city from enemies and to keep away misfortune, plagues, or natural calamities. Another Arab toponym was ''Qaṭāniyyah'' ({{lang|ar|قطانية}}), allegedly from the Arabic word for the &quot;[[Legume|leguminous plants]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Various authors|year=1987|title=Enciclopedia di Catania|language=it|publisher=Tringale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulses like [[lentil]]s, beans, peas, [[Vicia faba|broad beans]], and [[lupin]]s were chiefly cultivated in the plains around the city well before the arrival of [[Aghlabid]]s. Afterwards, many Arabic agronomists developed these crops and the [[citrus]] orchards in the area around the city.
The toponym ''Wādī Mūsá'' ({{lang|ar|وادي موسى}}), or &quot;the Valley of Moses&quot; (from the Arabic name of the [[Simeto]] River), was rarely used.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Correnti|first=Santi|year=1981|title=La Città Semprerifiorente|language=it|location=Catania|publisher=Greco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Correnti|first1=Santi|last2=Spartà|first2=Santino|year=2007|title=Le Strade di Catania|language=it|location=Rome|publisher=Newton Compton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

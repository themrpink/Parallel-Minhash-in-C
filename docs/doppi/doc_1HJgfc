==First journeys==

===Westbound===
[[File:Stamp US Pony Express 25c.jpg|right|thumb|This 25-cent stamp printed by [[Wells Fargo]] was canceled in [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]], [[Nevada]], and used on a revived Pony Express run between there and [[Sacramento]] beginning in 1862.]]

The first westbound Pony Express trip left St. Joseph on April 3, 1860, and arrived 10 days later in Sacramento, California, on April 14. These letters were sent under cover from the east to St. Joseph, and never directly entered the U.S. mail system. Today, only a single letter is known to exist from the inaugural westbound trip from St. Joseph to Sacramento.{{sfnp|Frajola|Kramer|Walske|2005}} It was delivered in an envelope embossed with postage (depicted below) that was first issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Scotts Specialized catalogue of U.S. Postage Stamps / Envelopes&lt;/ref&gt;

The messenger delivering the ''mochila'' from [[New York City|New York]] and [[Washington, DC]], missed a connection in Detroit and arrived in [[Hannibal, Missouri]], two hours late. The railroad cleared the track and dispatched a special locomotive called ''Missouri'' with a one-car train to make the {{convert|206|mi|km|adj=on}} trek across Missouri in a record 4 hours and 51 minutes, an average of {{convert|40|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arrived at Olive and 8th Street, a few blocks from the company's new headquarters in a hotel at [[Patee House]] at 12th and Penn Street, St. Joseph, and the company's nearby stables on Penn Street. The first pouch contained 49 letters, five private telegrams, and some papers for San Francisco and intermediate points.{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20160312195057/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/poex/hrs/hrs2.htm Chap 2] }}

St. Joseph [[Mayor]] [[M. Jeff Thompson]], William H. Russell, and Alexander Majors gave speeches before the ''mochila'' was handed off. The ride began at about 7:15&amp;nbsp;pm. The ''[[St. Joseph Gazette]]'' was the only newspaper included in the bag.

The identity of the first rider has long been in dispute. The St. Joseph ''Weekly West'' (April 4, 1860) reported [[Johnson William Richardson]] was the first rider.{{sfnp|Root|Hickman|1946|loc=Note 358}}
[[Johnny Fry]] is credited in some sources as the rider. Nonetheless, the first westbound rider carried the pouch across the Missouri River ferry to [[Elwood, Kansas]]. The first horse-ridden leg of the Express was only about {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} from the Express stables/railroad area to the Missouri River ferry at the foot of Jules Street. Reports indicated that horse and rider crossed the river. In later rides, the courier crossed the river without a horse and picked up his mount at a stable on the other side.

The first westbound ''mochila'' reached  Sacramento, on April 14, at 1:00&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref&gt;

The first eastbound Pony Express trip left Sacramento on April 3, 1860, and arrived at its destination 10 days later in St. Joseph, Missouri. From St. Joseph, letters were placed in the U.S. mails for delivery to eastern destinations. Only two letters are known to exist from the inaugural eastbound trip.{{sfn|Peters|1996|pp=160–162}}

==Mail==
[[File:Pony Express stamp2-1$.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Pony Express Stamp, 1860]]
As the Pony Express mail service existed only briefly in 1860 and 1861, few examples of Pony Express mail survive. Contributing to the scarcity of Pony Express mail is that the cost to send a {{convert|1/2|oz|g|adj=on}} letter was $5.00{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1955|p=61}} at the beginning ({{Inflation|US|5|1860|fmt=eq|r=-1}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}). By the end of the Pony Express, the price had dropped to $1.00 per {{frac|1|2}} ounce but even that was considered expensive to mail one letter. Only 250 known examples of Pony Express mail remain.{{sfnp|Frajola|Kramer|Walske|2005}}

==Fastest mail service==
William Russell, senior partner of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, and one of the biggest investors in the Pony Express, used the 1860 presidential election as a way to promote the Pony Express and how fast it could deliver the U.S. Mail. Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed [[Fort Kearny]], Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only 7 days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an &quot;unrivaled feat at the time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

==Attacks==
[[File:Pony Express Stolen Mail 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stolen Pony Express mail. Notation on cover reads &quot;recovered from a mail stolen by the Indians in 1860&quot; and bears a New York backstamp of May 3, 1862, the date when it was finally delivered in New York. The cover is also franked with U.S. Postage issue of 1857, Washington, 10c black.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scotts&quot; /&gt;]]

The [[Paiute War]] was a minor series of raids and ambushes initiated by American expansion into the territory of the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Indian tribe in Nevada, which resulted in the disruption of mail services of the Pony Express. It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward.
In the brief history of the Pony Express, only once did the mail not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the Paiute Indian War in May 1860.

About 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named [[Numaga]]. For three days, Numaga fasted and argued for peace.{{sfnp|Angel|1881|p=151}}
Meanwhile, a raiding party attacked Williams Station, a Pony Express station located on the [[Carson River]] near present-day [[Lake Lahontan]]. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.{{sfnp|Michno|2007|p=89-90}}

During the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when Whites in the Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; 16 employees were killed, and around 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute War cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860,.{{sfnp|Frajola|Kramer|Walske|2005|p=18}}

During this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860, did not immediately reach its destination. That mail pouch (''mochila'') did not reach St. Joseph and subsequently New York until almost two years later.

==Famous riders==
In 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work&amp;nbsp;– riders had to be tough and lightweight. A famous advertisement allegedly read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred{{efn|One historian, Joseph Nardone, claims that the &quot;orphans preferred&quot; ad is a hoax (dating no earlier than 1902), as no one has found the ad in contemporary newspaper archives.{{sfnp|Thompson|2005}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Pony Express had an estimated 80 riders traveling east or west along the route at any given time. In addition, about 400 other employees were used, including station keepers, stock tenders, and route superintendents. Many young men applied; Waddell and Majors could have easily hired riders at low rates, but instead offered $100 a month{{snd}}a handsome sum for that time.{{sfnp|Reinfeld|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PSAOQ83qZ2cC&amp;pg=PA49 49]}} Author [[Mark Twain]] described the riders in his travel memoir ''[[Roughing It]]'' as: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;usually a little bit of a man&quot;. Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenaged boys, they came to be seen as heroes of the American West.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}} There was no systematic list of riders kept by the company,{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=73–74}} but a partial list has been compiled by Raymond and Nancy Settle in their ''Saddles &amp; Spurs'' (1972).{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=74–76}}

===First riders===
[[File:Riders Pony Express.jpg|thumb|&quot;Billy&quot; Richardson, Johnny Fry, Charles Cliff, Gus Cliff]]

The identity of the first westbound rider to depart St. Joseph has been disputed, but currently most historians have narrowed it down to either [[Johnny Fry]] or [[Johnson William Richardson|Billy Richardson]].{{sfnp|Root|Hickman|1946|loc=Note 358}}&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSStables&quot; /&gt;{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994|loc=[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/poex/hrs/hrs2e.htm Chap 2 p. 5]}}&lt;ref name=&quot;museum&quot; /&gt; Both Expressmen were hired at St. Joseph for A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the mail pouch was delivered to the first rider on April 3, 1860, time was taken out for ceremonies and several speeches. First, Mayor M. Jeff Thompson gave a brief speech on the significance of the event for St. Joseph. Then William H. Russell and Alexander Majors addressed the gala crowd about how the Pony Express was just a &quot;precursor&quot; to the construction of a transcontinental railroad. At the conclusion of all the speeches, around 7:15&amp;nbsp;pm, Russell turned the mail pouch over to the first rider. A cannon fired, the large assembled crowd cheered, and the rider dashed to the landing at the foot of Jules Street,where the ferry boat ''Denver'', under a full head of steam, alerted by the signal cannon, waited to carry the horse and rider across the Missouri River to Elwood, Kansas Territory.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1955|p=58}}{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p= 31}} On April 9 at 6:45&amp;nbsp;pm, the first rider from the east reached Salt Lake City, Utah. Then, on April 12, the mail pouch reached Carson City, Nevada Territory, at 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm. The riders raced over the Sierra Nevadas, through Placerville, California, and on to Sacramento. Around midnight on April 14, 1860, the first mail pouch was delivered by the Pony Express to San Francisco. With it was a letter of congratulations from [[James Buchanan|President Buchanan]] to California [[John G. Downey|Governor Downey]] along with other official government communications, newspapers from New York, Chicago, and St. Louis, and other important mail to banks and commercial houses in San Francisco. In all, 85 pieces of mail were delivered on this first trip.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|pp=46–47}}

James Randall is credited as &quot;the first eastbound rider&quot; from the San Francisco Alta telegraph office, since he was on the steamship ''[[:File:Steamer antelope.jpg|Antelope]]'' to go to Sacramento.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mail for the Pony Express left San Francisco at 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm, carried by horse and rider to the waterfront, and then on by steamboat to Sacramento, where it was picked up by the Pony Express rider. At 2:45&amp;nbsp;am, William (Sam) Hamilton was the first Pony Express rider to begin the journey from Sacramento. He rode all the way to Sportsman Hall Station, where he gave his ''mochila ''filled with mail to Warren Upson.{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994|loc=[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/poex/hrs/hrs8b.htm Chap 8 p. 3]}} A California Registered Historical Landmark plaque at the site reads:

===William Cody===
[[File:Buffalo Bill Cody ca1875.jpg|thumb|upright|William &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody]]
Probably more than any other rider in the Pony Express, William Cody (better known as [[Buffalo Bill]]) epitomizes the legend and the folklore, be it fact or fiction, of the Pony Express.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p=127}}{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=83}} Numerous stories have been told of young Cody's adventures as a Pony Express rider. At the age of 15, Cody was on his way west to California when he met Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the construction of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short {{convert|45|mi|adj=on}} delivery run from the township of Julesburg, which lay to the west. After some months, he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming, where he made the longest nonstop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of {{convert|322|mi}} over one of the most dangerous sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required to complete this section.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}  On one occasion when carrying mail, he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party, but managed to escape. Cody was present for many significant chapters in early western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads, and cattle herding on the Great Plains. A career as a scout for the Army under General [[Phillip Sheridan]] following the Civil War earned him his nickname and established his notoriety as a frontiersman.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Bill's Wild West, R.L.

===Robert Haslam===
[[File:Haslam.gif|thumb|upright|Robert &quot;Pony Bob&quot; Haslam in later years]]
[[Robert Haslam (Pony Bob)|&quot;Pony Bob&quot; Haslam]] was among the most brave, resourceful, and best-known riders of the Pony Express. He was born January 1840 in London, England, and came to the United States as a teenager. Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland's Station near Fort Churchill, {{convert|75|mi}} to the east.

His greatest ride, {{convert|120|mi}} in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The mail carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Indian problems in 1860 led to Haslam's record-breaking ride. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. When he reached Buckland's Station, his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of {{convert|190|mi}} without a rest. After a rest of 9 hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail, where at Cold Springs, he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock. On the ride, he was shot through the jaw with an Indian arrow, losing three teeth.&lt;ref&gt;

Finally, he reached Buckland's Station, making the {{convert|380|mi|adj=on}} round trip the longest on record.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}

Pony Bob continued to work as a rider for Wells Fargo and Company after the Civil War, scouted for the U.S. Army well into his 50s, and later accompanied his good friend &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody on a diplomatic mission to negotiate the surrender of Chief [[Sitting Bull]] in December 1890. He drifted in and out of public mention, but  died in Chicago during the winter of 1912 (age 72) in deep poverty after suffering a stroke. Buffalo Bill paid for his friend's headstone at [[Mount Greenwood]] Cemetery (111 Street and Sacramento) on Chicago's far south side.{{sfnp|Corbett|2003|pp=198–199}}

===Jack Keetley===
[[File:Jkeetley.jpg|thumb|upright|Jack Keetley]]
Jack Keetley was hired by A. E. Lewis for his division at the age of 19, and put on the run from Marysville to Big Sandy. He was one of those who rode for the Pony Express during the entire 19 months of its existence.

Jack Keetley's longest ride, upon which he doubled back for another rider, ended at Seneca, where he was taken from the saddle sound asleep. He had ridden {{convert|340|mi}} in 31 hours without stopping to rest or eat.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p=109}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Visscher&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Visscher|first=William Lightfoot|title=Pony Express, A Thrilling and Truthful History|publisher=Vistabooks|year=1980}}&lt;!-- A Thrilling and Truthful History of the Pony Express https://books.google.com/books?id=5ucpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP1 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the Pony Express was disbanded, Keetley went to [[Salt Lake City]], where he engaged in mining. He died there on October 12, 1912, where he was also buried.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=100}}

In 1907, Keetley wrote the following letter (excerpt):

{{quote|Alex Carlyle was the first man to ride the Pony Express out of St. Joe. He was a nephew of the superintendent of the stage line to Denver, called the &quot;Pike's Peak Express&quot;. The superintendent's name was Ben Ficklin. Carlyle was a consumptive, and could not stand the hardships, and retired after about two-months' trial, and died within about six months after retiring. John Frye was the second rider, and I was the third, and Gus Cliff was the fourth.
&lt;br&gt;
I made the longest ride without a stop, only to change horses. It was said to be 300 miles and was done a few minutes inside of twenty-four hours. I do not vouch for the distance being correct, as I only have it from the division superintendent, A.E. Lewis, who said that the distance given was taken by his English roadometer which was attached to the front wheel of his buggy which he used to travel over his division with, and which was from St. Joe to Fort Kearney.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visscher&quot; /&gt;|Jack Keetley}}

===Billy Tate===
Billy Tate was a 14-year-old Pony Express rider who rode the express trail in Nevada near Ruby Valley. During the Paiute uprising of 1860, he was chased by a band of Paiute Indians on horseback and was forced to retreat into the hills behind some big rocks, where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows, but was not scalped, a sign that the Paiutes honored their enemy.{{sfnp|McNesse|2009|p=105}}

==Horses==

At the west end of the Pony Express route in California, W.W. Finney purchased 100 head of short-coupled stock called &quot;California horses&quot;,  while A.B. Miller purchased another 200 native ponies in and around the Great Salt Lake Valley. The horses were ridden quickly between stations, an average distance of {{convert|15|mi}}, and then were relieved and a fresh horse was exchanged for the one that just arrived from its strenuous run.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

During his route of {{convert|80|to|100|mi}}, a Pony Express rider would change horses 8 to 10 times. The horses were ridden at a fast trot, canter, or gallop, around {{convert|10|to|15|mph}} and at times they were driven to full gallop at speeds up to {{convert|25|mph}}. Horses of the Pony Express were purchased in Missouri, Iowa, California, and some western U.S. territories.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The various types of horse ridden by riders of the Pony Express included [[Morgan horse|Morgans]] and thoroughbreds, which were often used on the eastern end of the trail. [[Mustangs]] were often used on the western (more rugged) end of the mail route.&lt;ref&gt;

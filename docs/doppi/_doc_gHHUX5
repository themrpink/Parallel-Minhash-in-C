==Plot synopsis==
In Arizona, a bandit known as The Cisco Kid robs a stagecoach. Word of this deed reaches to Sergeant Micky Dunn, who gets tasked by his superior to bring in The Cisco Kid dead or alive, with a $5,000 reward promised once he succeeds. They meet in a barber shop, though Dunn is unaware of The Cisco Kid's true identity and passes him off as a friendly civilian. When he leaves, the local blacksmith tells him that was The Cisco Kid, much to Dunn's chagrin.

The Cisco Kid is in a relationship with Tonia Maria, and visits her often. He loves her, but she has frequent affairs without his knowledge. Dunn and Maria meet each other and begin an affair. Dunn tells Maria that once he takes down The Cisco Kid, he will give the $5,000 reward to Maria, making her fall in love with him. They express their love for each other while The Cisco Kid secretly watches and listens nearby, learning of her betrayal. 
 
She writes a secret letter to Dunn telling him to come that evening to take down The Cisco Kid before he makes his escape. However, The Cisco Kid finds this letter and replaces it with a fake letter &quot;from Maria&quot; which he wrote. His note says that he will be dressed up in Maria's clothes in an effort to disguise himself from Dunn, while Maria is actually in The Cisco Kid's clothes riding away. Dunn receives this fake letter, believing it to be from Maria. When The Cisco Kid leaves her house, Dunn shoots Maria, believing her to be The Cisco Kid in disguise. Now farther away, The Cisco Kid laments that &quot;[Maria's] flirting days are over, and she can finally settle down&quot;. He then makes his escape.

==Cast==

== Production ==

[[Raoul Walsh]] was set to direct and star as the [[Cisco Kid]] in this film, but had to abandon the project when a [[jackrabbit]] jumped through a windshield of a vehicle he was driving and cost Walsh an eye, after which he wore an eyepatch for the remainder of his life. Walsh never acted again but continued his illustrious career as a film director.

'''Driftwood''' is [[wood]] that has been washed onto a shore or beach of a sea, lake, or river by the action of winds, tides or waves.

In some [[Dock (maritime)|waterfront]] areas, driftwood is a major nuisance. However, the driftwood provides shelter and food for birds, fish and other aquatic species as it floats in the ocean. [[Gribble]]s, [[shipworm]]s and [[bacterium|bacteria]] decompose the wood and gradually turn it into nutrients that are reintroduced to the [[food web]]. Sometimes, the partially decomposed wood washes ashore, where it also shelters birds, plants, and other species. Driftwood can become the foundation for [[sand dunes]].

Most driftwood is the remains of [[tree]]s, in whole or part, that have been washed into the [[ocean]], due to [[flood]]ing, high winds, or other natural occurrences, or as the result of [[logging]].  There is also a subset of driftwood known as drift lumber. Drift lumber includes the remains of man-made wooden objects, such as buildings and their contents washed into the sea during storms, wooden objects discarded into the water from shore, dropped [[dunnage]] or lost [[cargo]] from ships ([[jetsam]]), and the remains of [[shipwreck]]ed wooden ships and boats ([[flotsam]]).  Erosion and wave action may make it difficult or impossible to determine the origin of a particular piece of driftwood.

Driftwood can be used as part of decorative [[furniture]] or other [[art]] forms, and is a popular element in the [[aquascaping|scenery of fish tanks]].

==Use as firewood==
The EPA includes driftwood in its list of &quot;Items You Should Never Burn in Your [Wood-Burning] Appliance,&quot; because it will &quot;release toxic chemicals when burned&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/burnwise/best-wood-burning-practices|title=Burn Wise - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA, OAR, OAQPS|date=|website=US EPA|accessdate=1 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Driftwood in history==
According to [[Norse mythology]], the first humans, [[Ask and Embla]], were formed out of two pieces of driftwood, an [[ash (tree)|ash]] and an [[elm]], by the god [[Odin]] and his brothers, [[Vili and Vé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godchecker.com/pantheon/norse-mythology.php?deity=ASK|title=Ask|website=Godchecker.com|accessdate=2 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vikings would cast wood into the sea before making landfall. The location of the wood would be an indication as to where to build their [[mead hall]]s. The wood used would found the high-seat pillars of the new hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/mythology/religion/text/practices.htm|title=Pagan Religious Practices of the Viking Age|website=Hurstwic|accessdate=2 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driftwood carried by [[Arctic]] rivers was the main, or sometimes only, source of wood for some [[Inuit]] and other Arctic populations living north of the [[tree line]] until they came into regular contact with [[Europe]]an traders. Traditional Inuit boats such as the [[kayak]] were fashioned from driftwood frames covered in skins. The Inuit classified driftwood into seven different types, each possessing its own unique material and visual properties. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | s2cid=30708560| doi=10.7202/1015953ar| title=Wood use and kayak construction: Material selection from the perspective of carpentry| year=2013| last1=Walls| first1=Matthew| journal=Études/Inuit/Studies| volume=36| pages=49–62| doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driftwood could be used to make bows if it was straight grained and in reasonably good condition; these were reinforced with sinew cables. The Inuit even made arrows from driftwood;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheelandt|first1=Stéphanie|last2=Bhiry|first2=Najat|last3=Marguerie|first3=Dominique|last4=Desbiens|first4=Caroline|last5=Napartuk|first5=Minnie|last6=Desrossiers|first6=Pierre M.|date=2013|title=Inuit knowledge and use of wood resources on the west coast of Nunavik, Canada|url=https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/etudinuit/2013-v37-n1-etudinuit01423/1025259ar.pdf|journal=Études/Inuit/Studies|volume=7|issue=1|pages=147-174|access-date=10 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; these were often short and fitted with bone or antler foreshafts. Dry scrapings produced by working this material were collected, stored and used for the starting of fires year-round by Inuit peoples. Wood that is burned today in these regions mainly consists of the remains of condemned wooden structures. Driftwood is still used as kindling by some. Woods with resinous qualities, such as cedar, are preferred for their lengthier burning times. 

The &quot;[[Old Man of the Lake]]&quot; in [[Crater Lake]], [[Oregon]] is a full-size tree that has been bobbing vertically in the lake for more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, J., &quot;The Old Man of the Lake,&quot; [https://web.archive.org/web/20090116011644/http://www.nps.gov/archive/crla/notes/vol27e.htm ''Nature Notes from Crater Lake National Park''], Vol. XXVII (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the cold water of the lake, the tree has been well preserved.

Driftwood sculptures are sculptures that are made of driftwood found on beaches or along riverbanks.
*At [[Kullaberg]], [[Sweden]], [[Lars Vilks]] created [[Ladonia (micronation)|Nimis]] a driftwood artwork in the year 1980.  This sculpture and two others led to the declaration of [[Ladonia (micronation)|Ladonia]] as an independent nation.

==Decline==
With the advent of industrial logging practices, the global quantity of driftwood has declined. Early accounts indicate that driftwood was once more plentiful. Early photographs of the [[pacific coast]] reveal greater amounts of driftwood on the beaches than is present today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Grand Hotel''''' is a 1932 American [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Edmund Goulding]] and produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. The screenplay by [[William A. Drake]] is based on the 1930 play of the same title by Drake, who had adapted it from the 1929 novel ''[[Grand Hotel (novel)|Menschen im Hotel]]'' by [[Vicki Baum]]. To date, it is the only film to have won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] without being nominated in any other category.

The film was remade as ''[[Week-End at the Waldorf]]'' in 1945, and also served as the basis for the 1989 stage musical ''[[Grand Hotel (musical)|Grand Hotel]]''. Another remake, to be directed by [[Norman Jewison]], was considered in 1977 which was to take place at Las Vegas' [[MGM Grand Hotel &amp; Casino|MGM Grand Hotel]], but the project eventually fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothman|first1=Hal|last2=Davis|first2=Mike|title=The Grit Beneath the Glitter: Tales from the Real Las Vegas|date=15 March 2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520225381|pages=41–42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwxU8dgsZJkC&amp;q=%22grand+hotel%22&amp;pg=PA382|access-date=5 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grand Hotel'' has proven influential in the years since its original release. The line &quot;I want to be alone&quot;, famously delivered by [[Greta Garbo]], placed number 30 in ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]''. In 2007, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Announces National Film Registry Selections for 2007|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-07-254/librarian-of-congress-announces-2007-film-registry/2007-12-27/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing {{!}} Film Registry {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Greta Garbo John Barrymore Grand Hotel still.jpg|thumb|left|[[Greta Garbo]] and [[John Barrymore]] in ''Grand Hotel'']]
[[File:Grand-Hotel-Beery-Crawford-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Wallace Beery]] and [[Joan Crawford]]]]
Doctor Otternschlag, a disfigured veteran of World War I and a permanent resident of the Grand Hotel in Berlin, observes, &quot;People coming, going. Nothing ever happens&quot; — after which a great deal transpires.

Baron Felix von Gaigern, who squandered his fortune and supports himself as a card player and occasional jewel thief, befriends Otto Kringelein, a dying accountant who has decided to spend his remaining days in the lap of luxury. Kringelein's former employer, industrialist General Director Preysing, is at the hotel to close an important deal, and he hires stenographer Flaemmchen to assist him. She aspires to be an actress and shows Preysing some magazine photos for which she posed, implying she is willing to offer him more than typing if he advances her career.

Another guest is Russian [[Ballet|ballerina]] Grusinskaya, whose career is on the wane. When the Baron is in her room to steal her jewelry and she returns from the theatre, he hides in her room and overhears as she talks to herself about wanting to end it all. He comes out of hiding and engages her in conversation, and Grusinskaya finds herself attracted to him. He spends the night with her. The following morning, the Baron returns Grusinskaya's jewels, and she forgives his crime. She invites him to accompany her to [[Vienna]], an offer he accepts.

The Baron is desperate for money to pay his way out of the criminal group he has been working with. He and Kringelein get a card game going, and Kringelein wins everything, then becomes intoxicated. When he drops his wallet, the Baron stashes it in his pocket, intending to keep not only the winnings but the funds that will see Kringelein through the last weeks of his life. However, moved by the sight of  Kringelein’s despair, the Baron – who desperately needs the money, but has become very fond of Kringelein – pretends to have discovered the wallet, and returns it to him.

As part of a desperate merger plan, Preysing must travel to London, and he asks Flaemmchen to accompany him. Later, when the two are in her room—which opens onto his—Preysing sees the shadow of the Baron rifling through his belongings. He confronts the Baron; the two struggle, and Preysing bludgeons the Baron with the telephone, killing him. Flaemmchen sees what happened and tells Kringelein, who confronts Preysing. He insists he acted in self-defense, but Kringelein summons the police, and Preysing is arrested.

Grusinskaya departs for the train station, expecting to find the Baron waiting for her there. Meanwhile, Kringelein offers to take care of Flaemmchen, who suggests they seek a cure for his illness. As they leave the hotel, Doctor Otternschlag again observes, &quot;Grand Hotel. Always the same. People come. People go. Nothing ever happens.&quot;

The film was also seen as an artistic achievement in its art direction and production quality. The art director, [[Cedric Gibbons]], was one of the most important and influential in the history of American film. The lobby scenes were extremely well done, portraying a 360° desk. This allowed audiences to watch the hotel action from all around the characters. It changed the way sets were made from that point onward.&lt;ref&gt;Balio, Tino (1993).

It was the first film to feature brothers Lionel and John Barrymore together. Later in the year, they would join their other sibling, [[Ethel Barrymore|Ethel]], in ''[[Rasputin and the Empress]]''.

===&quot;I want to be alone&quot;===
As Grusinskaya, Greta Garbo delivers the line &quot;I want to be alone&quot;, and, immediately following, &quot;I just want to be alone.&quot; Soon after, in conversation with Baron Felix von Gaigern, she says, &quot;And I want to be alone.&quot; Referring to its legendary use as a characterization of her personal reclusive life, Garbo later insisted, &quot;I never said I want to be alone; I only said, 'I want to be ''let'' alone.' There is all the difference.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Bainbridge, &quot;[http://www.garboforever.com/1955_Life-3.htm The Braveness To Be Herself]&quot;, part 3 of &quot;The Divine Garbo&quot; in ''Life'', January 24, 1955.

==Critical reception==
[[File:Grand-Hotel-Astor.jpg|thumb|New York City opening of ''Grand Hotel'' at the [[Astor Theatre (New York City)|Astor Theatre]] (April 12, 1932)]]
Alfred Rushford Greason of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' comparing the film to the stage production, wrote &quot;[it] may not entirely please the theatregoers who were fascinated by its deft stage direction and restrained acting, but it will attract and hold the wider public to which it is now addressed&quot;. He added, &quot;The drama unfolds with a speed that never loses its grip, even for the extreme length of nearly two hours, and there is a captivating pattern of unexpected comedy that runs through it all, always fresh and always pat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greason |first=Alfred Rushford |date=April 19, 1932 |title=Grand Hotel |url=https://variety.com/1932/film/reviews/grand-hotel-2-1200410647/ |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |page=14 |access-date=December 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the performances of Greta Garbo and John Barrymore, in a mostly positive review. &quot;The picture adheres faithfully to the original&quot;, he said, &quot;and while it undoubtedly lacks the life and depth and color of the play, by means of excellent characterizations it keeps the audience on the qui vive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hall |first=Mordaunt |author-link=Mordaunt Hall |date=April 13, 1932 |title=Review: Grand Hotel |url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/hotel-re.html |journal=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=December 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Film Daily]]'' called it an &quot;engrossing drama&quot; that &quot;never lags&quot;, and &quot;one of the classiest moving picture affairs you've seen in a long time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 17, 1932 |title=Grand Hotel |journal=[[Film Daily]] |location=New York |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called it a &quot;tricky, clever film&quot;, praising Goulding as &quot;a director at last to give Garbo her due&quot; and for his &quot;ingenious&quot; camera work, &quot;relishing, I suspect, the advantages the screen offers in these respects over the stage, where the awkward constant shifting of scenes clogged the action of the play&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mosher |first=John |author-link=John Mosher (writer) |date=April 23, 1932 |title=The Current Cinema |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |pages=68–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film currently holds an 86% approval rating on the film review aggregating website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 42 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 7.58/10. The site's consensus reads: &quot;Perhaps less a true film than a series of star-studded vignettes, Grand Hotel still remains an entertaining look back at a bygone Hollywood era.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/grand_hotel/&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2009, Blake Goble of ''[[The Michigan Daily]]'' called it &quot;the original ''[[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' for its star power&quot;, and compared it to ''[[Gosford Park]]'' &quot;for its dense structure and stories&quot;. He added, &quot;[T]he pacing is quick, the acting is eloquent, and the stories are actually interesting. It's pure theatricality. But ''Hotel'' lasted thanks to its simplicity, and the star power doesn't hurt either. This is grand, old Hollywood captured on film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/node/47167 |title=Film Vault: Grand Hotel |last1=Goble |first1=Blake |date=January 25, 2009 |website=[[The Michigan Daily]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131101758/http://www.michigandaily.com/node/47167 |archive-date=January 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

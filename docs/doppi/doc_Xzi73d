=== Post-classical history===
[[File:Archäologisches Landesmuseum Schloss Gottorf 034.JPG|thumb|Two wooden round shields survived at [[Thorsberg moor]] (3rd century AD)]]

Typical in the early European [[Middle Ages]] were [[Viking Age arms and armour#Round shields|round shields]] with light, non-splitting wood like [[Little-leaf Linden|linden]], [[fir]], [[alder]] or [[populus|poplar]], usually reinforced with [[leather]] cover on one or both sides and occasionally metal rims, encircling a metal [[shield boss]]. These light shields suited a fighting style where each incoming blow is intercepted with the boss in order to deflect it. The Normans introduced the [[kite shield]] around the 10th century, which was rounded at the top and tapered at the bottom. This gave some protection to the user's legs, without adding too much to the total weight of the shield. The kite shield predominantly features [[enarmes]], leather straps used to grip the shield tight to the arm. Used by foot and mounted troops alike, it gradually came to replace the round shield as the common choice until the end of the 12th century, when more efficient limb armour allowed the shields to grow shorter, and be entirely replaced by the 14th century.

As body armour improved, [[knight]]'s shields became smaller, leading to the familiar [[heater shield]] style. Both kite and heater style shields were made of several layers of laminated wood,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=SYED RAMSEY.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/971924562|title=Tools of war;history of weapons in ancient times.|publisher=ALPHA EDITIONS|isbn=93-86019-80-9|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=971924562}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a gentle curve in cross section. The heater style inspired the shape of the symbolic [[heraldic shield]] that is still used today. Eventually, specialised shapes were developed such as the ''bouche'', which had a [[lance]] rest cut into the upper corner of the lance side, to help guide it in combat or tournament. Free standing shields called [[pavise]]s, which were propped up on stands, were used by medieval [[crossbow]]men who needed protection while reloading.

In time, some armoured foot knights gave up shields entirely in favour of mobility and two-handed weapons. Other knights and common soldiers adopted the [[buckler]], giving rise to the term &quot;[[swashbuckler]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hadesign.co.uk/SSA/html/buckler.htm |archive-date=2012-02-07 |title=The Sussex Rapier School |publisher=Hadesign.co.uk |access-date=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buckler is a small round shield, typically between 8 and 16&amp;nbsp;inches (20–40&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter. The buckler was one of very few types of shield that were usually made of metal. Small and light, the buckler was easily carried by being hung from a belt; it gave little protection from missiles and was reserved for hand-to-hand combat where it served both for protection and offence. The buckler's use began in the Middle Ages and continued well into the 16th century.

In Italy, the [[targe|targa]], [[parma (shield)|parma]] and [[Rodeleros|rotella]] were used by common people, fencers and even knights. The development of plate armour made shields less and less common as it eliminated the need for a shield. Lightly armoured troops continued to use shields after [[men-at-arms]] and knights ceased to use them. Shields continued in use even after [[gunpowder]] powered weapons made them essentially obsolete on the battlefield. In the 18th century, the [[Scottish clans]] used a small, round targe that was partially effective against the firearms of the time, although it was arguably more often used against British infantry bayonets and cavalry swords in close-in fighting.

During the 19th century, non-industrial cultures with little access to guns were still using war shields. [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] warriors carried large lightweight shields called [[Nguni shield|Ishlangu]] made from a single ox hide supported by a wooden spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rrtraders.com/Shields/zuluw.htm |title=Zulu Shield (Longo) |publisher=Rrtraders.com |access-date=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was used in combination with a short spear ([[assegai]]) and/or [[club (weapon)|club]]. Other african shields include [[Glagwa]] from [[Cameroon]] or Nguba from [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].

=== Modern history ===

==== Law enforcement shields ====

Shields for protection from armed attack are still used by many [[police]] forces around the world. These modern shields are usually intended for two broadly distinct purposes. The first type, [[riot shield]]s, are used for [[riot control]] and can be made from [[metal]] or polymers such as polycarbonate [[Lexan]] or [[Makrolon]] or boPET [[Mylar]]. These typically offer protection from relatively large and low velocity projectiles, such as rocks and bottles, as well as blows from fists or clubs. Synthetic riot shields are normally transparent, allowing full use of the shield without obstructing vision. Similarly, metal riot shields often have a small window at eye level for this purpose. These riot shields are most commonly used to block and push back crowds when the users stand in a &quot;wall&quot; to block protesters, and to protect against [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]], [[projectiles]], [[molotov cocktails]], and during [[hand-to-hand combat]].

The second type of modern police shield is the bullet-resistant [[ballistic shield]], also called tactical shield. These shields are typically manufactured from advanced synthetics such as [[Kevlar]] and are designed to be [[bulletproof]], or at least [[bullet resistant]]. Two types of shields are available:

# Light weight level IIIA shields that stop hand guns and submachine guns.
# Heavy Level III and IV shields that stop rifle rounds.

Tactical shields often have a [[Firing port|firing port]] so that the officer holding the shield can fire a weapon while being protected by the shield, and they often have a bulletproof glass viewing port. They are typically employed by specialist police, such as [[SWAT]] teams in high risk entry and siege scenarios, such as hostage rescue and breaching gang compounds, as well as in antiterrorism operations.

Law enforcement shields often have a large signs stating &quot;POLICE&quot; (or the name of a force, such as &quot;US MARSHALS&quot;) to indicate that the user is a law enforcement officer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

      <text bytes="10074" xml:space="preserve">A '''shift register''' is a type of [[digital circuit]] using a cascade of [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]s where the output of one flip-flop is connected to the input of the next. They share a single [[clock signal]], which causes the data stored in the system to shift from one location to the next. By connecting the last flip-flop back to the first, the data can cycle within the shifters for extended periods, and in this form they were used as a form of [[computer memory]]. In this role they are very similar to the earlier [[delay line memory]] systems and were widely used in the late 1960s and early 1970s to replace that form of memory.

In most cases, several parallel shift registers would be used to build a larger memory pool known as a &quot;[[bit array]]&quot;. Data was stored into the array and read back out in parallel, often as a [[computer word]], while each bit was stored serially in the shift registers. There is an inherent trade-off in the design of bit arrays; putting more flip-flops in a row allows a single shifter to store more bits, but requires more clock cycles to push the data through all of the shifters before the data can be read back out again.

Shift registers can have both [[parallel communication|parallel]] and [[serial communication|serial]] inputs and outputs. These are often configured as &quot;serial-in, parallel-out&quot; (SIPO) or as &quot;parallel-in, serial-out&quot; (PISO). There are also types that have both serial and parallel input and types with serial and parallel output. There are also &quot;bidirectional&quot; shift registers which allow shifting in both directions: L→R or R→L. The serial input and last output of a shift register can also be connected to create a &quot;circular shift register&quot;. A PIPO register (parallel in, parallel out) is very fast – an output is given within a single clock pulse.

These are the simplest kind of shift registers. The data string is presented at &quot;Data In&quot;, and is shifted right one stage each time &quot;Data Advance&quot; is brought [[Logic_level|high]]. At each advance, the bit on the far left (i.e. &quot;Data In&quot;) is shifted into the first [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]'s output. The bit on the far right (i.e. &quot;Data Out&quot;) is shifted out and lost. 

The data is stored after each [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] on the &quot;Q&quot; output, so there are four storage &quot;slots&quot; available in this arrangement, hence it is a 4-bit Register. To give an idea of the shifting pattern, imagine that the register holds 0000 (so all storage slots are empty). As &quot;Data In&quot; presents 1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0 (in that order, with a pulse at &quot;Data Advance&quot; each time—this is called clocking or strobing) to the register, this is the result. The right hand column corresponds to the right-most flip-flop's output pin, and so on.

So the serial output of the entire register is 00001101. It can be seen that if data were to be continued to input, it would get exactly what was put in (10110000), but offset by four &quot;Data Advance&quot; cycles. This arrangement is the hardware equivalent of a [[Queue (data structure)|queue]]. Also, at any time, the whole register can be set to zero by bringing the reset (R) pins high.

This arrangement performs ''destructive readout'' - each datum is lost once it has been shifted out of the right-most bit.

==Serial-in parallel-out (SIPO)==

[[Image:4-Bit SIPO Shift Register.png|frame|center]]

This configuration allows conversion from serial to parallel format. Data  input is serial, as described in the SISO section above. Once the data has been clocked in, it may be either read off at each output simultaneously, or it can be shifted out.

In this configuration, each flip-flop is [[Signal_edge | edge triggered]]. All flip-flops operate at the given clock frequency.  Each input bit makes its way down to the Nth output after N clock cycles, leading to parallel output.

In cases where the parallel outputs should not change during the serial loading process, it is desirable to use a latched or [[Data buffer|buffered]] output. In a latched shift register (such as the [[List of 7400 series integrated circuits|74595]]) the serial data is first loaded into an internal buffer register, then upon receipt of a load signal the state of the buffer register is copied into a set of output registers. In general, the practical application of the serial-in/parallel-out shift register is to convert data from serial format on a single wire to parallel format on multiple wires.

== Parallel-in serial-out (PISO) ==
This configuration has the data input on lines D1 through D4 in parallel format, D1 being the most significant bit. To write the data to the register, the Write/Shift control line must be held LOW. To shift the data, the W/S control line is brought HIGH and the registers are clocked. The arrangement now acts as a PISO shift register, with D1 as the Data Input. However, as long as the number of clock cycles is not more than the length of the data-string, the Data Output, Q, will be the parallel data read off in order. [[Image:4-Bit PISO Shift Register.png|frame|center|4-Bit PISO Shift Register]] The animation below shows the write/shift sequence, including the internal state of the shift register. [[Image:4-Bit PISO Shift Register Seq.gif|center]]

==Uses==

One of the most common uses of a shift register is to convert between serial and parallel interfaces. This is useful as many circuits work on groups of bits in parallel, but serial interfaces are simpler to construct. Shift registers can be used as simple delay circuits. Several bidirectional shift registers could also be connected in parallel for a hardware implementation of a [[stack (data structure)|stack]].

SIPO registers are commonly attached to the output of microprocessors when more [[general-purpose input/output]] pins are required than are available. This allows several binary devices to be controlled using only two or three pins, but more slowly than by parallel output. The devices in question are attached to the parallel outputs of the shift register, and the desired state for all those devices can be sent out of the microprocessor using a single serial connection. Similarly, PISO configurations are commonly used to add more binary inputs to a microprocessor than are available – each binary input (such as a button or more complicated circuitry) is attached to a parallel input of the shift register, then the data is sent back via serial to the microprocessor using several fewer lines than originally required.

Shift registers can also be used as pulse extenders. Compared to monostable multivibrators, the timing has no dependency on component values, however, it requires external clock and the timing accuracy is limited by a granularity of this clock. Example: [[Ronja Twister]], where five 74164 shift registers create the core of the timing logic this way ([http://ronja.twibright.com/schematics/twister.png schematic]).

In early computers, shift registers were used to handle data processing: two numbers to be added were stored in two shift registers and clocked out into an [[Arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)]] with the result being fed back to the input of one of the shift registers (the accumulator) which was one bit longer since binary addition can only result in an answer that is the same size or one bit longer.  

Many computer languages include instructions to &quot;shift right&quot; and &quot;shift left&quot; the data in a register, effectively dividing by two or multiplying by two for each place shifted.

Very large serial-in serial-out shift registers (thousands of bits in size) were used in a similar manner to the earlier [[delay line memory]] in some devices built in the early 1970s. Such memories were sometimes called &quot;circulating memory&quot;. For example, the [[Datapoint 3300]] terminal stored its display of 25 rows of [[Characters per line|72 columns]] of upper-case characters using fifty-four 200-bit shift registers, arranged in six tracks of nine packs each, providing storage for 1800 six-bit characters. The shift register design meant that scrolling the terminal display could be accomplished by simply pausing the display output to skip one line of characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitsavers.org/pdf/datapoint/3300/70116_3300termMaint_Dec76.pdf bitsavers.org], ''DataPoint 3300 Maintenance Manual'', December 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the first known examples of a shift register was in the Mark 2 [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], a code-breaking machine built in 1944. It was a six-stage device built of [[vacuum tube]]s and [[thyratron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Flowers |first= Thomas H. |authorlink=Tommy Flowers |url=http://www.ivorcatt.com/47c.htm | title =The Design of Colossus |journal=Annals of the History of Computing |volume=5 |issue=3 |year= 1983|page=246 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.1983.10079}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shift register was also used in the [[IAS machine]], built by [[John von Neumann]] and others at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in the late 1940s.

'''Shot noise''' or '''Poisson noise''' is a type of noise which can be modeled by a [[Poisson process]].
In electronics shot noise originates from the [[Elementary charge|discrete nature]] of electric charge. Shot noise also occurs in photon counting in optical devices, where shot noise is associated with the [[Wave–particle duality|particle nature]] of light.

==Origin==

It is known that in a [[Probability theory|statistical experiment]] such as tossing a fair coin and counting the occurrences of heads and tails, the numbers of heads and tails after a great many throws will differ by only a tiny percentage, while after only a few throws outcomes with a significant excess of heads over tails or vice versa are common; if an experiment with a few throws is repeated over and over, the outcomes will fluctuate a lot. From [[law of large numbers]], one can show that the relative fluctuations reduce as the reciprocal square root of the number of throws, a result valid for all statistical fluctuations, including shot noise.

Shot noise exists because phenomena such as light and electric current consist of the movement of discrete (also called &quot;quantized&quot;) 'packets'.  Consider light&amp;mdash;a stream of discrete photons&amp;mdash;coming out of a laser pointer and hitting a wall to create a visible spot. The fundamental physical processes that govern light emission are such that these photons are emitted from the laser at random times; but the many billions of photons needed to create a spot are so many that the brightness, the number of photons per unit of time, varies only infinitesimally with time. However, if the laser brightness is reduced until only a handful of photons hit the wall every second, the relative fluctuations in number of photons, i.e., brightness, will be significant, just as when tossing a coin a few times. These fluctuations are shot noise.

The concept of shot noise was first introduced in 1918 by [[Walter Schottky]] who studied fluctuations of current in [[vacuum tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schottky|first=W.|year=1918|title=Über spontane Stromschwankungen in verschiedenen Elektrizitätsleitern|journal=[[Annalen der Physik]]|volume=57|issue=23|pages=541–567|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.19183622304|bibcode = 1918AnP...362..541S |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1424341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shot noise may be dominant when the finite number of particles that carry energy (such as [[electron]]s in an electronic circuit or [[photon]]s in an optical device) is sufficiently small so that uncertainties due to the [[Poisson distribution]], which describes the occurrence of independent random events, are of significance. It is important in [[electronics]], [[telecommunications]], [[optical detector|optical detection]], and fundamental [[physics]].

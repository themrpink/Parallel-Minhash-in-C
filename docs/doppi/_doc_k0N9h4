In some countries, especially in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], judges wear [[Wig (hair)|wigs]]. The long wig often associated with judges is now reserved for ceremonial occasions, although it was part of the standard attire in previous centuries.  A short wig resembling but not identical to a [[barrister]]'s wig (a Bench Wig) would be worn in court.  This tradition, however, is being phased out in Britain in non-criminal courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BRITAIN_JUDGES_WIGS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT Hosted.ap.org]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Oman]], the judge wears a long stripe (red, green white), while the attorneys wear the black gown.

In Portugal and in the former [[Portuguese Empire]], the judges used to carry a staff that was red for ordinary judges and white for the [[Juiz de fora (office)|judges from the outside]].

==== Hong Kong ====
In [[Hong Kong]], court proceedings are conducted in either English or [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] (a dialect of [[Yue Chinese]]). Judges of Hong Kong retain many of the English traditions such as wearing wigs and robes in trials.

In the lower courts, magistrates are addressed as ''Your worship'', and district court judges as ''Your Honour''.

In the superior courts of record, namely the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] and the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] (which consists of the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] and the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]]), judges are addressed as ''My Lord'' or ''My Lady'' and referred to as ''Your Lordship'' or ''Your Ladyship'', following the English tradition.

In writing, the post-nominal letters ''PJ'' is used to refer to a permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal and ''NPJ'' to a non-permanent judge. In the High Court, the abbreviation ''JA'' is used to denote a justice of appeal, and the letter ''J'' refers to a judge of the Court of First Instance.

[[Master (judiciary)|Masters]] of the High Court are addressed as ''Master''.

When trials are conducted in Chinese, judges were addressed, in Cantonese, as ''Fat Goon Dai Yan'' ({{Lang-yue|法官大人|lit=Judge, your lordship|translit= faat3 gun1 daai6 jan4 |label=[[Hong Kong Cantonese]]}}) before the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, and as ''Fat Goon Gok Ha'' ({{Lang-yue|法官閣下|links=no|lit=Judge, your honour|translit=faat3 gun1 gok3 haa6|label= Hong Kong Cantonese}}) since 1997. ''Fat Goon'' ({{Lang-yue|法官|links=no|lit=Judge|translit=faat gun1|label=Hong Kong Cantonese}}) means the word &quot;judge&quot;.

In India, judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts were addressed as ''Your Lordship'' or ''My Lord'' and ''Your Ladyship'' or ''My Lady'', a tradition directly attributable to England. The [[Bar Council of India]] had adopted a resolution in April 2006 and added a new Rule 49(1)(j) in the [[Legal practice laws in India|Advocates Act]]. As per the rule, lawyers can address the court as ''Your Honour'' and refer to it as ''Honourable Court''. If it is a subordinate court, lawyers can use terms such as ''sir'' or any equivalent phrase in the regional language concerned. Explaining the rationale behind the move, the Bar Council had held that the words such as ''My Lord'' and ''Your Lordship'' were &quot;relics of the colonial past&quot;. The resolution has since been circulated to all state councils and the Supreme Court for adoption but over five years now, the resolution largely remained on paper.

However, in an unprecedented move in October 2009, one of the judges of Madras HC, Justice K Chandru had banned lawyers from addressing his court as ''My Lord'' and ''Your Lordship''.

Typically after every naming you will hear ''haShofét'', meaning &quot;the judge&quot; after the respective address.

====Canada====
In general, Canadian judges may be addressed directly, depending on the province, as &quot;My Lord&quot;, &quot;My Lady&quot;, &quot;Your Honour&quot; or &quot;Justice&quot; and are formally referred to in the third person as &quot;The Honourable Mr. (or Madam) Justice 'Forename Surname'&quot;.  Less formally, judges of a Superior Court are referred to as &quot;Justice 'Surname'&quot;, not as &quot;Judge 'Surname.'&quot;  When referred to in a decision of a court, judges' titles are often abbreviated to the suffix &quot;J.&quot;, so that Justice Smith will be referred to as Smith J.  Judges in some superior courts are addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://albertacourts.ab.ca/go/CourtServices/FamilyJusticeServices/tabid/139/Default.aspx |title=Albertacourts.ab.ca |publisher=Albertacourts.ab.ca |accessdate=2013-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233046/http://albertacourts.ab.ca/go/CourtServices/FamilyJusticeServices/tabid/139/Default.aspx |archivedate=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ontario]], judges are rarely referred to as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady,&quot; but only as &quot;Your Honour&quot; at the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ojen.ca/sites/ojen.ca/files/sites/default/files/resources/Jurisdiction%20of%20Ontario%20Courts.pdf|title = Ontario Justice Education Network Handout: The Jurisdiction of Ontario Courts|access-date = 2016-02-23|publisher = Ontario Justice Education Network|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160328080446/http://ojen.ca/sites/ojen.ca/files/sites/default/files/resources/Jurisdiction%20of%20Ontario%20Courts.pdf|archivedate = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, translations of these titles such as ''Votre Honneur'' (&quot;your honour&quot;) or ''Votre Seigneurie'' (&quot;your lordship&quot;) were used in French; today, only ''Monsieur le juge'' and ''Madame la juge'' are officially used. Both the titles &quot;judge&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; are translated ''juge.''

Generally, it is only appropriate to use the term &quot;judge&quot; when speaking of an anonymous or general position, such as &quot;the trial judge,&quot; or when referring to a member of an inferior or provincial court such as the Ontario Court of Justice. The exception is [[Citizenship Judge]]s who are referred to only as &quot;Judge 'Surname.'&quot; in accordance with their appointment as independent decision makers of the [[Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada#Citizenship Commission|Citizenship Commission]].

===Skolt Sami===

The [[abessive]] marker for nouns in [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sámi]] is ''-tää'' or ''-taa'' in both the singular and the plural:
:''Riâkkum veäʹrtää.'' &quot;I cried for no reason.&quot;
The [[abessive]]-like non-finite verb form ([[converb]]) is ''-ǩâni'' or ''-kani'':
:''Son vuõʹlji domoi mainsteǩâni mõʹnt leäi puättam.'' &quot;He/she went home without saying why he/she had come.&quot;
Unlike Finnish, the Skolt Sámi abessive has no competing expression for lack of an item.

===Inari Sami===

The [[abessive]] marker for nouns in [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sámi]] is ''-táá.'' The corresponding non-finite verb form is ''-hánnáá,'' ''-hinnáá'' or ''-hennáá.''

===Other Sami languages===
The abessive is not used productively in the Western Sámi languages, although it may occur as a [[cranberry morpheme]].

===Hungarian===
In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the abessive case is marked by ''-talan'' for back vowels and ''-telen'' for front vowels according to [[vowel harmony]]. Sometimes, with certain roots, the suffix becomes ''-tlan'' or ''-tlen''. For example:
:''pénz'' &quot;money&quot;
:''pénztelen'' &quot;without money&quot;
:''haza'' &quot;home(land)&quot;
:''hazátlan'' &quot;(one) without a homeland&quot;
There is also the postposition ''nélkül,'' which also means without, but is not meant for physical locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hungarianreference.com/postpositions-prepositions-personal-pronomial-before-after-between-instead-without.aspx|title=Postpositions (prepositions) in Hungarian [HungarianReference.com &gt; Grammar &gt; Misc grammar &gt; Postpositions]|website=www.hungarianreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Cukor nélkül iszom a teát.'' &quot;I drink tea without sugar.&quot;
:''Testvér nélkül éltem.'' &quot;I lived without siblings.&quot;
:''Eljöttél Magyarországra a testvéred nélkül?'' &quot;Did you come to Hungary without your sibling?&quot;

==In Turkic languages==

===Bashkir===

In [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]] the suffix is ''-һыҙ''/''-һеҙ'' (''-hïð''/''-hĭð'').

===Turkish===
The suffix ''-siz'' (variations: ''-sız'', ''-suz'', ''-süz'') is used in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

Ex: ''evsiz'' (''ev'' = house, houseless/homeless), ''barksız'', ''görgüsüz'' (''görgü'' = good manners, ill-bred), ''yurtsuz''.

===Azerbaijani===
The same suffix is used in the [[Azerbaijani language]].

===Chuvash===

In [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] the suffix is ''-сĂр''.

===Kyrgyz===

In [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] the suffix is ''-сIз''.

      <text bytes="16985" xml:space="preserve">In [[grammar]], the '''comitative case''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|ɪ|t|ə|t|ɪ|v}}; abbreviated {{sc|'''com'''}}) is a [[grammatical case]] that denotes accompaniment.&lt;ref name=Stolz2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stolz|last2=Stroh|last3=Urdze|first1=Thomas|first2=Cornelia|first3=Aina|title=On Comitatives and Related Categories: A Typological Study with Special Focus on the Languages of Europe|year=2006|location=Berlin|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co.|isbn=9783110197648|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KYwb6-w1AjkC&amp;q=on+comitatives+and+related+categories}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17–23}} In [[English language|English]], the preposition &quot;with&quot;, in the sense of &quot;in company with&quot; or &quot;together with&quot;, plays a substantially similar role (other uses of &quot;with&quot;, like in the meaning of &quot;using&quot; or &quot;by means of&quot; (I cut bread with a knife), correspond to the [[instrumental case]] or related cases).

==Core meaning==

Comitative case encodes a relationship of &quot;accompaniment&quot; between two participants in an event, called the &quot;accompanier&quot; and the &quot;companion&quot;. In addition, there is a &quot;relator&quot; (which can be of multiple lexical categories, but is most commonly an affix or adposition).&lt;ref name=Stolz2006 /&gt;{{rp|17–18}} Use of Comitative case gives prominence to the accompanier.&lt;ref name=Stolz2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stolz|last2=Stroh|last3=Urdze|first1=Thomas|first2=Cornelia|first3=Aina|title=The Oxford Handbook of Case|year=2009|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|chapter=Varieties of Comitative|editor=Andrej Malchukov and Andrew Spencer|pages=593–600}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|602}} This [[Italian language|Italian]] sentence is an example:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''il professore''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;accompanier&lt;/sub&gt; ''entra nell'aula'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''con''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;relator&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''i suoi studenti''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;companion&lt;/sub&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;'the professor enters the lecture-hall (together) with his students'&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref name=Stolz2009 /&gt;{{rp|602}}

In this case, ''il professore'' is the accompanier, ''i suoi studenti'' is the companion, and ''con'' is the relator. As the accompanier, ''il professore'' is the most prominent.

[[Animacy]] also plays a major role in most languages with a comitative case. One group of languages requires both the accompanier  and the companion to be either human or animate. Another group requires both to be in the same category: both human or both animate. A third group requires an animate accompanier and an inanimate companion. Other languages have no restrictions based on animacy.&lt;ref name=Stolz2009 /&gt;{{rp|603–604}}

==Comparison to similar cases==

The comitative case is often conflated or confused with other similar cases, especially the [[instrumental case]] and the [[associative case]].

The comitative relates to an accompanier and a companion, and the instrumental relates to an [[agent (grammar)|agent]], an [[object (grammar)|object]], and a [[patient (grammar)|patient]].&lt;ref name=Narrog&gt;{{cite book|last=Narrog|first=Heiko|title=The Oxford Handbook of Case|year=2009|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|chapter=Varieties of Instrumental|editor=Andrej Malchukov and Andrew Spencer|pages=601–608}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|593}} Enrique Palancar defines the role of Instrumental case as &lt;nowiki&gt;'the role played by the object the Agent manipulates to achieve a change of state of the Patient.'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palancar|first=E. L.|year=1999|title=Instrumental Prefixes in Amerindian Languages: An Overview to their Meanings, Origin, and Functions|journal=Sprachtypologie und Universalienforschung|volume=52|pages=151–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the difference is straightforward, because the instrumental and the comitative are expressed the same way in many languages, including [[English language|English]], it is often difficult to separate them.

Russian is one of many languages that differentiate morphologically between instrumental and comitative:

:{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Я || пойду || в || кино || с || мамой
|-
| I || go || in || cinema || with || mom.{{sc|instr}}
|}
:&lt;nowiki&gt;'I'll go to the cinema with my mom.'&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Я || нарезал || хлеб || этим || ножом
|-
| I || cut || bread || this.{{sc|instr}} || knife.{{sc|instr}}
|}
:&lt;nowiki&gt;'I cut the bread with this knife.'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=Heine&amp;Kuteva&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heine|last2=Kuteva|first1=Bernd|first2=Tania|title=The Changing Languages of Europe|year=2006|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russian, the comitative is marked by adding a preposition ''s'' and by declining the companion in the instrumental case. In the instrumental case, the object is declined, but no preposition is added.&lt;ref name=Heine&amp;Kuteva /&gt;

The comitative case is often confused with the associative case. Before the term comitative was applied to the accompanier-companion relationship, the relationship was often called associative case, a term still used by some linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haspelmath|first=Martin|title=The Oxford Handbook of Case|year=2009|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|editor=Andrej Malchukov and Andrew Spencer|chapter=Terminology of Case|pages=514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to distinguish between the comitative and the associative because the associative also refers to a specific variety of the comitative case that is used in Hungarian.&lt;ref name=Stolz2009 /&gt;{{rp|605}}

==Expressions of comitative semantic relation==

Grammatical case is a category of inflectional morphology. The comitative case is an expression of the comitative semantic relation through inflectional [[affixation]], by [[prefix]]es, [[suffix]]es and [[circumfix]]es. Although all three major types of affixes are used in at least a few languages, suffixes are the most common expression. Languages which use affixation to express the comitative include [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], which uses suffixes; [[Totonac languages|Totonac]], which uses prefixes; and [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], which uses circumfixes.&lt;ref name=Stolz2009 /&gt;{{rp|602}}

Comitative relations are also commonly expressed by using [[prepositions|adpositions]]: prepositions, postpositions and circumpositions. Examples of languages that use adpositional constructions to express comitative relations are French, which uses prepositions; [[Wayampi language|Wayãpi]], which uses postpositions; and [[Bambara language|Bambara]], which uses circumpositions.&lt;ref name=Stolz2009/&gt;{{rp|603}}

[[Adverb|Adverbial constructions]] can also mark comitative relations, but they act very similarly to adpositions. One language that uses adverbs to mark the comitative case is Latvian.&lt;ref name=Stolz2009 /&gt;{{rp|603}}

The final way in which comitative relations can be expressed is by [[Serial verb construction|serial-verb constructions]]. In these languages, the comitative marker is usually a verb whose basic meaning is &quot;to follow&quot;. A language which marks comitative relations with serial-verb constructions is [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref name=Stolz2009/&gt;{{rp|603}}

==Examples==

===Indo-European languages===
====French====
French uses prepositions to express the comitative semantic relation.

:{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| avec || sa || mère
|-
| {{sc|com}} || {{sc|poss}} || mother
|}
:&lt;nowiki&gt;'with his/her mother'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=Stolz2009 /&gt;{{rp|605}}

In this case, the preposition &quot;avec&quot; is used to express the comitative semantic relation. The preposition &quot;avec&quot; is the standard comitative marker in French; however, French has a special case, the [[ornative case]], a variety of comitative for bodily property or clothes{{what|date=August 2017}}. The French ornative marker is &quot;à&quot;.&lt;ref name=Stolz2009 /&gt;{{rp|603}}

====Latvian====
In Latvian, both instrumental and comitative are expressed with the preposition ''ar''&lt;ref name=Stolz2006 /&gt;{{rp|102}} However, it is used only when the companion is in accusative and singular or when it is in dative and plural. Otherwise the co-ordinating conjunction ''un'' is used.&lt;ref name=Stolz2006 /&gt;{{rp|21}}

:{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| un || Nelda || ar || Rudolfu || ļoti || nozīmīgi || paskatījās || uz || Ernestīni
|-
| and || Nelda.{{sc|nom}} || {{sc|com}} || Rudolf.{{sc|acc}} || very || significantly || {{sc|prev}}.look.{{sc|pret.refl}}.3 || on || Ernestine.{{sc|acc}}
|}
:&lt;nowiki&gt;'And Nelda and Rudolf looked very knowingly at Ernestine.'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=Stolz2006 /&gt;{{rp|21}}

In the example above, ''ar'' is used because Rudolf, the companion, is in accusative and singular. Below, it is used in the other case that it is allowed, with a dative plural companion.

:{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| jo || ne-bija || ne-kāda || prieka || dzīvot || zem || sveša
|-
| because || {{sc|neg}}-be.{{sc|past}}.3 || {{sc|neg}}-some.{{sc|gen}} || fun.{{sc|gen}} || live.{{sc|inf}} || under || foreign.{{sc|gen}}
|}

:{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| jumta || un || vēl || ar || vis-iem || zirg-iem || un || rat-iem
|-
| roof.{{sc|gen}} || and || still || {{sc|com}} || all-{{sc|dat.pl}} || horse-{{sc|dat.pl}} || and || cart-{{sc|dat.pl}}
|}
:&lt;nowiki&gt;'Because it was no fun to live under someone else's roof, especially with all the horses and the cart'&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref name=Stolz2006 /&gt;{{rp|307}}

|-
| ''pestä'' || (''pes-'') || ''pessyt''
|-

|}

The assimilation causes the final consonant cluster to be strengthened which in turn can weaken a strong cluster if one exists in the stem. See ''harjoitella'' above.

In verbs of types IV, V and VI, the ''t'' at the end of the stem is assimilated to the ''n'':

|}

====Present passive participle====
The present passive participle can be constructed from the past passive form of the verb. The ''-iin'' ending of the past passive is replaced with ''-ava/ävä'', which can be inflected in the same way as the present active participle. For example:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Infinitive !! Past passive!! Passive participle !! English
|-
| ''antaa'' || ''annettiin'' || ''annettava'' || which is to be given
|-
| ''syödä'' || ''syötiin'' || ''syötävä'' || which is to be eaten
|-
| ''kertoa'' || ''kerrottiin'' || ''kerrottava'' || which is to be told
|}
It is possible to translate this participle in several related ways e.g. ''sanottava'' 'which must be/is to be said', 'which can be said', 'which will be said' or 'which is said'.
Here are some sentences and phrases further illustrating the formation and use of the present passive participle:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''Juotava vesi'' || Drinkable water
|-
| ''Onko sinulla mitään sanottavaa?'' || Do you have anything to say?
|-
| ''Onko pöydässä jotakin syötävää?'' || Is there anything to eat on the table? Or even, Is there anything edible on the table?
|}
This participle can also be used in other ways. If used with the appropriate third-person singular form of the verb ''olla'' and with the subject in the genitive it can express necessity or obligation.

:''Minun on lähdettävä'' 'I must leave'
:''Heidän olisi mentävä'' 'They would have to go'

Inflected in the inessive plural, it can be used in conjunction with the verb 'to be' to indicate that something can or cannot be done.

:''Onko Pekka tavattavissa?'' 'Is Pekka available?'/'Is Pekka able to be met with?'

====Present active participle====
This participle is formed simply by finding the 3rd person plural form of the verb and removing -t, and acts as an adjective describing what the object or subject of the sentence is doing, for example:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Present active participle
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''nukku{{pipe}}va koira'' || 'sleeping dog'
|-
| ''häikäise{{pipe}}vä valo'' || 'blinding light'
|-
| ''olin luke{{pipe}}v{{pipe}}i{{pipe}}na{{pipe}}ni'' || 'I pretended to be reading'&lt;br /&gt;[{{abbr|act.|active}} I participle {{abbr|pl.|plural}} essive + {{abbr|poss.|possessive}} suffix]
|}

====Agent participle====
The agent participle is formed in a similar way as the third infinitive (see above), adding -ma or -mä to the verb stem. It allows the property of being a target of an action to be formatted as an adjective-like attribute. Like adjectives, it can be inflected in all cases. For example, '''''ihmisen tekemä''' muodostelma'' &quot;a '''man-made''' formation&quot;. The party performing the action is indicated by the use of genitive, or by a possessive suffix. This is reflected in English, too: ''ihmise'''n''' tekemä'' – &quot;of man'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s''' making&quot;, or ''kirjoittama'''ni''' kirja'' &quot;book of '''my''' writing&quot;. For example:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Agent participle
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''tytön lukema kirja'' || the book read by the girl
|-
| ''tytön lukemaa kirjaa'' || (partitive) the book read by the girl
|-
| ''tytön lukemassa kirjassa'' || in the book read by the girl
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | etc.
|}
It is not required for the action to be in the past, although the examples above are. Rather, the construction simply specifies the subject, the object and the action, with no reference to time. For an example in the future, consider: ''huomenna '''käyttämänänne''' välineenä on...'' &quot;tomorrow, as the instrument '''you will be using''' is...&quot;. Here, ''käyttämä'' &quot;that which is used&quot; describes, i.e. is an attribute to ''väline'' &quot;instrument&quot;. (Notice the case agreement between ''käyttämä-nä'' and ''välinee-nä''.) The suffix ''-nne'' &quot;your&quot; specifies the person &quot;owning&quot; the action, i.e. who does it, thus ''käyttämänne'' is &quot;that which was used by you({{abbr|pl.|plural}})&quot;, and ''käyttämänänne'' is &quot;as that which was used by you&quot;.

It is also possible to give the actor with a pronoun, e.g. ''sinun käyttämäsi'' &quot;that which was used by you&quot;. In standard language, the pronoun ''sinun'' &quot;your&quot; is not necessary, but the possessive suffix is. In inexact spoken usage, this goes vice versa; the possessive suffix is optional, and used typically only for the second-person singular, e.g. ''sun käyttämäs''.

===Negation of verbs===

====Present indicative====
Verbs are negated by using a [[negative verb]] in front of the stem from the present tense (in its 'weak' consonant form). This verb form used with the negative verb is called a [[connegative]].

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Present indicative
|-
! Finnish !! English !! !! Finnish !! English
|-
! colspan=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Singular
|-
| ''tiedän'' || 'I know' || → || ''en tiedä'' || 'I don't know'
|-
| ''tiedät'' || 'you know' || → || ''et tiedä'' || 'you don't know'
|-
| ''tietää'' || '(s)he knows' || → || ''ei tiedä'' || '(s)he doesn't know'
|-
! colspan=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Plural
|-
| ''tiedämme'' || 'we know' || → || ''emme tiedä'' || 'we don't know'
|-
| ''tiedätte'' || 'you know' || → || ''ette tiedä'' || 'you don't know'
|-
| ''tietävät'' || 'they know' || → || ''eivät tiedä'' || 'they don't know'
|}

Note that the inflection is on the negative verb, not on the main verb, and that the endings are regular apart from the 3rd-person forms.

====Present passive====
The negative is formed from the third-person singular &quot;negative verb&quot; ''ei'' and the present passive with the final ''-an'' removed:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''ei puhuta'' || 'it is not spoken'
|-
| ''ei tiedetä'' || 'it is not known'
|}

====Imperfect indicative====
The negative is formed from the appropriate part of the negative verb followed by the nominative form (either singular or plural depending on the number of the verb's subject) of the active past participle. So for ''puhua'' the pattern is:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Imperfect indicative
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Singular
|-
| ''en puhunut'' || 'I did not speak'
|-
| ''et puhunut'' || 'you did not speak'
|-
| ''ei puhunut'' || '(s/he) did not speak'
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Plural
|-
| ''emme puhuneet'' || 'we did not speak'
|-
| ''ette puhuneet'' || 'you did not speak'
|-
| ''eivät puhuneet'' || 'they did not speak'
|}

Note one exception: when the 'te' 2nd-person plural form is used in an honorific way to address one person, the singular form of the participle is used: ''te ette puhunut'' = 'you ({{abbr|sg.|singular}} polite) did not speak'.

====Imperfect passive====
The negative is formed from the third-person singular negative verb - 'ei' - and the nominative singular form of the passive present participle (compare this with the negative of the imperfect indicative):

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Imperfect passive
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''ei puhuttu'' || 'it was not spoken'
|-
| ''ei tiedetty'' || 'it was not known'
|}

Note that in the spoken language, this form is used for the first-person plural. In this case, the personal pronoun is obligatory:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''me ei menty'' || 'we did not go'
|}

==Adverbs==
A very common way of forming [[adverb]]s is by adding the ending ''-sti'' to the inflecting form of the corresponding adjective:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Adverbs
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''nopea, nopea'''sti''''' || 'quick, quickly'
|-
| ''kaunis, kaunii'''sti''''' || 'beautiful, beautifully'
|-
| ''hidas, hitaa'''sti''''' || 'slow, slowly'
|-
| ''helppo, helpo'''sti''''' || 'easy, easily'
|}

Adverbs modify verbs, not nouns, therefore they do not inflect. ''-sti'' adverbs are not used to modify adjectives (such as to express degree) like ''-ly'' adverbs might be in English; the genitive of adjectives is used for this purpose.

===Comparative formation===
The comparative form of the adverb has the ending ''-mmin''.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Comparative formation
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''nopea, nopea'''sti''', nopea'''mmin''''' || 'quick, quickly, more quickly/faster'
|-
| ''kaunis, kauni'''isti''', kauni'''immin''''' || 'beautiful, beautifully, more beautifully'
|-
| ''hidas, hita'''asti''', hita'''ammin''''' || 'slow, slowly, more slowly'
|-
| ''helppo, helpo'''sti''', helpo'''mmin''''' || 'easy, easily, more easily'
|}

===Superlative formation===
The superlative form of the adverb has the ending ''-immin''.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Superlative formation
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''helppo, helposti, helpommin, helpoimmin'' || 'easy, easily, more easily, most easily'
|}

Because of the ''-i-'', the stem vowel can change, similarly to superlative adjectives, or to avoid runs of three vowels:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''nopea, nopeasti, nopeammin, nopeimmin'' || 'quick, quickly, more quickly/faster, fastest'
|-
| ''kaunis, kauniisti, kauniimmin, kauneimmin'' || 'beautiful, beautifully, more beautifully, most beautifully'
|-
| ''hidas, hitaasti, hitaammin, hitaimmin'' || 'slow, slowly, more slowly, most slowly'
|}

===Irregular forms===
There are a number of irregular adverbs, including:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Irregular forms
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''hyvä, hyvin, paremmin, parhaiten'' || 'good, well, better, best'
|}

==Numbers==
{{Main|Finnish numerals}}

The ordinary counting numbers (cardinals) from 0 to 10 are given in the table below. Cardinal numbers may be inflected and some of the inflected forms are irregular in form.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Cardinal numbers and key inflected forms
|-
! Number !! [[Nominative]] !! [[Genitive]] !! [[Partitive case|Partitive]] || [[Illative case|Illative]]
|-
| 0 || nolla || nollan || nollaa || nollaan
|-
| 1 || yksi || yhden || yhtä || yhteen
|-
| 2 || kaksi || kahden || kahta ||  kahteen
|-
| 3 || kolme || kolmen || kolmea || kolmeen
|-
| 4 || neljä || neljän || neljää || neljään
|-
| 5 || viisi || viiden || viittä || viiteen
|-
| 6 || kuusi || kuuden || kuutta || kuuteen
|-
| 7 || seitsemän (*) || seitsemän || seitsemää (†) ||seitsemään
|-
| 8 || kahdeksan (‡) || kahdeksan || kahdeksaa || kahdeksaan
|-
| 9 || yhdeksän (‡‡) || yhdeksän || yhdeksää || yhdeksään
|-
| 10 || kymmenen || kymmenen || kymmentä || kymmeneen
|}

(*) sometimes abbreviated as ''seiska'' (in the spoken language only)&lt;br /&gt; 
(†) sometimes ''seitsentä'' (alternative form) &lt;br /&gt;
(‡) sometimes abbreviated as ''kasi'' (in the spoken language only)&lt;br /&gt;
(‡‡) sometimes abbreviated as ''ysi'' (in the spoken language only)

To form teens, ''toista'' is added to the base number. ''Toista'' is the partitive form of ''toinen'', meaning &quot;second group of ten&quot;. Hyphens are written here to separate morphemes. In Finnish text, hyphens are not written.
* ''yksi-toista'', ''kaksi-toista'', … ''yhdeksän-toista''
:one-second.{{sm|part}}, two-second.{{sm|part}}, … nine-second.{{sm|part}}
:&quot;one of the second, two of the second, … nine of the second&quot;
:11, 12, … 19

==Sentence structure==

===Word order===
Since Finnish is an inflected language, word order within sentences can be much freer than, for example, English. In English the strong [[subject–verb–object]] order typically indicates the function of a noun as either subject or object although some English structures allow this to be reversed. In Finnish sentences, however, the role of the noun is determined not by word order or sentence structure as in English but by case markings which indicate subject and object.

The most usual neutral order, however, is [[subject–verb–object]]. But usually what the speaker or writer is talking about is at the head of the sentence.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English!!Note
|-
| ''koira puri miestä'' || 'the dog bit the man' || we are talking of the dog and what it did
|-
| ''miestä puri koira'' || 'the man was bitten by a/the dog' ||we are talking about the man and what it was that bit him, e.g. not a snake
|-
| ''koira miestä puri'' || 'the dog bit the man' || we are talking of the dog's actions in a somewhat poetic form or confirming that it was the dog that bit the man, not some other animal
|}

Here ''koira'' ('dog') is in the nominative form but ''mies'' ('man') is marked as object by the case marked form miestä. This sentence is a bald statement of fact. Changing the word order changes the emphasis slightly but not the fundamental meaning of the sentence.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English !! Note
|-
| ''minulla on rahaa'' || 'I have money' || a bald statement of fact
|-
| ''rahaa minulla on'' || 'money is something I do have' || although I may not have something else
|-
| ''rahaa on minulla'' || 'The money is with me' || I am telling you where the money is
|-
| ''minulla rahaa on'' || 'I've definitely got (the) money' || I am confirming that I do have (the) money
|-
| ''on minulla rahaa'' || 'Yes, I do have (the) money' || if having money has been questioned
|}

''Minulla'' here is the word ''minä'' (I) in a case form ending ''-lla'' which when used with the verb ''olla'' (to be, expressed here in the form ''on'') expresses ownership. This is because Finnish does not have a verb form equivalent of the English word 'have'. ''Minulla''  is not considered the subject.

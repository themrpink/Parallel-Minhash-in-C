Bath is approximately {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} south-east of the larger city and port of Bristol, to which it is linked by the [[A4 road (England)|A4 road]], which runs through Bath, and is a similar distance south of the [[M4 motorway]] at junction 18. The potential new junction 18a linking the [[M4 motorway]] with the A4174 [[Avon Ring Road]] will provide an additional direct route from Bath to the motorway.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/news/new-m4-junction-near-bath-1330697.amp&lt;/ref&gt; The city plans to introduce a [[Clean Air Zone]] by the end of 2020, which would charge the most polluting vehicles £9 per day (and up to £100 per day for coaches and HGVs) to drive in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/bath-breathes-2021-overview/about-proposal |title=About the proposal |access-date=9 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209180419/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/bath-breathes-2021-overview/about-proposal |archive-date=9 February 2019 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to reduce the level of car use, [[park and ride]] schemes have been introduced which paradoxically are designed to increase traffic volumes, with sites at Odd Down, Lansdown and Newbridge. A very large increase in city centre parking was also provided under the new SouthGate shopping centre development, which necessarily introduces more car traffic. In addition, a [[bus gate]] scheme in Northgate aims to reduce private car use in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/transportandstreets/transportpolicy/plansandstrategies/bathpackage/|title=Bath Transport Package&amp;nbsp;– Major Scheme Bid |work=Bath and North East Somerset | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071027135101/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/transportandstreets/transportpolicy/plansandstrategies/bathpackage/| archivedate = 27 October 2007| accessdate = 2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] operates [[Coach (bus)|coach]] services from [[Bath bus station]] to a number of cities.

===Rivers and canals===
The city is connected to Bristol and the sea by the River Avon, navigable via [[lock (water transport)|locks]] by small boats. The river was connected to the [[River Thames]] and London by the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] in 1810 via [[Bath Locks]]; this waterway&amp;nbsp;– closed for many years but restored in the last years of the 20th century&amp;nbsp;– is now popular with [[narrowboat]] users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allsop |first=Niall |title=The Kennet &amp; Avon Canal |year=1987 |publisher=Millstream Book |location=Bath |isbn=978-0-948975-15-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/kennetavoncanalu0000alls/page/10 10] |url=https://archive.org/details/kennetavoncanalu0000alls/page/10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bath is on [[National Cycle Route 4]], with one of Britain's first [[Cycling infrastructure|Bicycle Paths (cycleway)]], the [[Bristol and Bath Railway Path]], to the west, and an eastern route toward London on the canal towpath.

===Railways===
[[File:2008 at Bath Spa station - view from Widecombe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bath Spa railway station]]]]
Bath is served by the [[Bath Spa railway station]] (designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]), which has regular connections to London [[London Paddington station|Paddington]], [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]], [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]], [[Cheltenham Spa railway station|Cheltenham]], [[Exeter]], [[Plymouth]] and [[Penzance]] (see [[Great Western Main Line]]), and also [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury]], [[Warminster]], [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], [[Salisbury]], [[Southampton]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Brighton]] (see [[Wessex Main Line]]). Services are provided by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]]. There is a suburban station on the main line, [[Oldfield Park railway station|Oldfield Park]], which has a limited commuter service to Bristol as well as other destinations.

[[Bath Green Park railway station|Green Park Station]] was once the terminus of the [[Midland Railway]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristolbathrailwaypath.org.uk/theoldrailway.shtml Bristol and Bath Railway Path: ''The Midland Railway''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128175422/http://www.bristolbathrailwaypath.org.uk/theoldrailway.shtml |date=28 November 2011 }}. Retrieved 8 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and junction for the [[Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway]], whose line, always steam hauled, went through the Devonshire tunnel (under the Wellsway, St Luke's Church and the Devonshire Arms), through the [[Combe Down Tunnel]] and climbed over the [[Mendip Hills|Mendips]] to serve many towns and villages on its {{convert|71|mi|km|0|adj=on}} run to [[Bournemouth]]. This example of an English rural line was closed by [[Beeching cuts|Beeching]] in March 1966. Its Bath station building, now restored, houses shops, small businesses, the Saturday Bath Farmers Market and parking for a supermarket, while the route of the Somerset and Dorset within Bath has been reused for the Two Tunnels Greenway, a shared use path that extends [[National Cycle Route 24]] into the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bath, Two Tunnels|url=http://www.sustrans.org.uk/news/thousands-join-us-celebrate-opening-two-tunnels-greenway-bath|publisher=Sustrans|accessdate=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505003713/http://www.sustrans.org.uk/news/thousands-join-us-celebrate-opening-two-tunnels-greenway-bath|archive-date=5 May 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trams===
====Historic====
The [[Bath Tramways Company]] was introduced in the late 19th century, opening on 24 December 1880. The {{RailGauge|48in}} gauge cars were horse-drawn along a route from London Road to the Bath Spa railway station, but the system closed in 1902. It was replaced by electric tram cars on a greatly expanded {{RailGauge|ussg}} gauge system that opened in 1904. This eventually extended to {{convert|18|mi|km}} with routes to Combe Down, Oldfield Park, Twerton, [[Newton St Loe]], Weston and [[Bathford]]. There was a fleet of 40 cars, all but 6 being double deck. The first line to close was replaced by a bus service in 1938, and the last went on 6 May 1939.&lt;ref name=tramways&gt;{{cite book|last= Oppitz |first= Leslie |title= Tramways Remembered: West and South West England |year= 1990 |publisher=Countryside Books |isbn= 978-1-85306-095-3|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Possible re-introduction====
In 2005 a detailed plan was created and presented to the Council to re-introduce trams to Bath, but the plan did not proceed, reportedly due to the focus by the Council on the government-supported busway planned to run from the Newbridge park and ride into the city centre. Part of the justification for the proposed tram reintroduction plan was the pollution from vehicles within the city, which was twice the legal levels, and the heavy traffic congestion due to high car usage. In 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/trams-work-bath/story-26246819-detail/story.html |title=Could trams work in Bath city centre?|date=28 March 2015|last=Connolly|first=Nancy|work=Bath Chronicle |accessdate=6 April 2017 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015195452/http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/trams-work-Bath/story-26246819-detail/story.html |archivedate=15 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; another group, Bath Trams building on the earlier tram group proposals has created interest in the idea of re-introducing trams with several public meetings and meetings with the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bathtrams.uk|title=Trams for Bath – the Pros and Cons – Bath Trams|website=Bath Trams|accessdate=28 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411060328/https://bathtrams.uk/|archive-date=11 April 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[Bath and North East Somerset Council]] announced a feasibility study, due to be published by March 2018, into implementing a light rail or tram system in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/news/bath-news/council-look-whether-light-rail-127910|title=Council to look at whether light rail tram system 'feasible' for Bath – Bath Chronicle|access-date=28 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623215930/http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/news/bath-news/council-look-whether-light-rail-127910|archive-date=23 June 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, the [[Local enterprise partnership|West of England Local Enterprise Partnership]] began a consultation process on their Transport Vision Summary Document, outlining potential [[light rail]]/[[tram]] routes in the region, one of which being a route from [[Bristol city centre]] along the [[A4 road (England)|A4 road]] to Bath to relieve pressure on bus and rail services between the two cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jointplanningwofe.org.uk/gf2.ti/-/757442/23234053.1/PDF/-/Joint_Transport_Study__Transport_Vision.pdf|title=West of England Joint Transport Study – Transport Vision Summary Document|access-date=16 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117144458/https://www.jointplanningwofe.org.uk/gf2.ti/-/757442/23234053.1/PDF/-/Joint_Transport_Study__Transport_Vision.pdf|archive-date=17 November 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Renaissance architecture''' is the European architecture of the period between the early 14th and early 16th centuries in different regions, demonstrating a conscious revival and development of certain elements of [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] thought and material culture. Stylistically, Renaissance architecture followed [[Gothic architecture]] and was succeeded by [[Baroque architecture]]. Developed first in [[Florence]], with [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] as one of its innovators, the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities. The style was carried to France, Spain, Germany, England, Russia and other parts of Europe at different dates and with varying degrees of impact.

Renaissance style places emphasis on [[symmetry]], [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]], [[geometry]] and the regularity of parts, as demonstrated in the architecture of [[classical antiquity]] and in particular ancient [[Roman architecture]], of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of [[column]]s, [[pilaster]]s and [[lintel]]s, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical [[dome]]s, [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] and [[aedicula]]e replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of [[Gothic architecture|medieval]] buildings.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Historiography==
The word &quot;Renaissance&quot; derives from the term ''rinascita'', which means rebirth, first appeared in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori'' (''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'', 1550).

Although the term Renaissance was used first by the French historian [[Jules Michelet]], it was given its more lasting definition from the Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], whose book ''Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien'', 1860 (The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, 1860, English translation, by SGC Middlemore, in 2 vols., London, 1878) was influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. The folio of measured drawings ''Édifices de Rome moderne; ou, Recueil des palais, maisons, églises, couvents et autres monuments'' (The Buildings of Modern Rome), first published in 1840 by Paul Letarouilly, also played an important part in the revival of interest in this period. [[Erwin Panofsky]], ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', (New York: Harper and Row, 1960) The Renaissance style was recognized by contemporaries in the term ''&quot;all'antica&quot;'', or &quot;in the ancient manner&quot; (of the Romans).

==Development in Italy==
{{Main|Italian Renaissance}}
Italy of the 15th century, and the city of Florence 
in particular, was home to the Renaissance. It is in Florence that the new architectural style had its beginning, not slowly evolving in the way that [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] grew out of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], but consciously brought to being by particular architects who sought to revive the order of a past &quot;[[Golden Age]]&quot;. The scholarly approach to the architecture of the ancient coincided with the general revival of learning. A number of factors were influential in bringing this about.

[[File:Baptisteriumganz.jpg|thumb|left|The Romanesque [[Florence Baptistery]] was the object of Brunelleschi's studies of perspective]]

===Architectural===

Italian architects had always preferred forms that were clearly defined and structural members that expressed their purpose.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; Many Tuscan Romanesque buildings demonstrate these characteristics, as seen in the [[Florence Baptistery]] and [[Pisa Cathedral]].

Italy had never fully adopted the Gothic style of architecture. Apart from the [[Milan Cathedral]], (influenced by French Rayonnant Gothic), few Italian churches show the emphasis on vertical, the clustered shafts, ornate tracery and complex ribbed vaulting that characterise Gothic in other parts of Europe.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

The presence, particularly in Rome, of ancient architectural remains showing the ordered [[Classical style]] provided an inspiration to artists at a time when philosophy was also turning towards the Classical.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

===Political===

In the 15th century, [[Florence]], [[Venice]] and [[Naples]] extended their power through much of the area that surrounded them, making the movement of artists possible. This enabled Florence to have significant artistic influence in [[Milan]], and through Milan, [[France]].

In 1377, the return of the Pope from the [[Avignon Papacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Joëlle Rollo-Koster, ''Raiding Saint Peter: Empty Sees, Violence, and the Initiation of the Great Western Schism (1378)'', (Brill, 2008), 182.&lt;/ref&gt; and the re-establishment of the [[Papal court]] in Rome, brought wealth and importance to that city, as well as a renewal in the importance of the Pope in Italy, which was further strengthened by the [[Council of Constance]] in 1417. Successive Popes, especially [[Julius II]], 1503–13, sought to extend the Pope’s [[Papal states|temporal power]] throughout Italy.&lt;ref name=A.M&gt;Andrew Martindale, ''Man and the Renaissance'', 1966, Paul Hamlyn, ISBN unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===

In the early Renaissance, [[Venice]] controlled sea trade over goods from the East. The large towns of [[Northern Italy]] were prosperous through trade with the rest of Europe, [[Genoa]] providing a seaport for the goods of France and Spain; [[Milan]] and [[Turin]] being centres of overland trade, and maintaining substantial metalworking industries. Trade brought wool from England to Florence, ideally located on the river for the production of fine cloth, the industry on which its wealth was founded. By dominating [[Pisa]], Florence gained a seaport, and also maintained dominance of Genoa. In this commercial climate, one family in particular turned their attention from trade to the lucrative business of money-lending. The [[House of Medici|Medici]] became the chief bankers to the princes of Europe, becoming virtually princes themselves as they did so, by reason of both wealth and influence.
Along the trade routes, and thus offered some protection by commercial interest, moved not only goods but also artists, scientists and philosophers.&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt; 
[[File:Melozzo da Forlì 001.jpg|thumb|Pope Sixtus IV, 1477, builder of the Sistine Chapel. Fresco by [[Melozzo da Forlì]] in the [[Vatican Palace]].]]

===Religious===

The return of the [[Pope Gregory XI]] from [[Avignon]] in September 1377 and the resultant new emphasis on [[Rome]] as the center of [[Christianity|Christian]] spirituality, brought about a surge in the building of churches in Rome such as had not taken place for nearly a thousand years. This commenced in the mid 15th century and gained momentum in the 16th century, reaching its peak in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] period. The construction of the [[Sistine Chapel]] with its uniquely important decorations and the entire rebuilding of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], one of Christendom's most significant churches, were part of this process.&lt;ref name= I.R.&gt;Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', 1979, Octopus, {{ISBN|0-7064-0857-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wealthy [[Republic of Florence]], the impetus for church-building was more civic than spiritual. The unfinished state of the enormous [[Florence Cathedral]] dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] did no honour to the city under her patronage. However, as the technology and finance were found to complete it, the rising dome did credit not only to the Virgin Mary, its architect and the Church but also to the [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]], the Guilds and the sectors of the city from which the manpower to construct it was drawn. The dome inspired further religious works in Florence.

===Philosophic===

The development of printed books, the rediscovery of ancient writings, the expanding of political and trade contacts and the exploration of the world all increased knowledge and the desire for education.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

The reading of philosophies that were not based on Christian theology led to the development of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] through which it was clear that while God had established and maintained order in the Universe, it was the role of Man to establish and maintain order in Society.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.Hale, ''Renaissance Europe, 1480–1520'', 1971, Fontana {{ISBN|0-00-632435-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil===

Through humanism, civic pride and the promotion of civil peace and order were seen as the marks of citizenship. This led to the building of structures such as Brunelleschi's [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]] with its elegant colonnade forming a link between the charitable building and the public square, and the [[Laurentian Library]] where the collection of books established by the Medici family could be consulted by scholars.&lt;ref name= Gardner&gt;[[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]], ''Art Through the Ages'', 5th edition, Harcourt, Brace and World.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major ecclesiastical building works were also commissioned, not by the church, but by guilds representing the wealth and power of the city. Brunelleschi’s dome at Florence Cathedral, more than any other building, belonged to the populace because the construction of each of the eight segments was achieved by a different  quarter of the city.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

===Patronage===

As in the [[Plato|Platonic academy]] of [[Athens]], it was seen by those of Humanist understanding that those people who had the benefit of wealth and education ought to promote the pursuit of learning and the creation of that which was beautiful. To this end, wealthy families—the [[Medici]] of Florence, the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] of Mantua, the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] in Rome, the [[House of Sforza|Sforzas]] in Milan—gathered around them people of learning and ability, promoting the skills and creating employment for the most talented artists and architects of their day.&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

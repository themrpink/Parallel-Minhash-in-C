=== Orbital angular momentum multiplexing ===
[[Orbital angular momentum multiplexing]] is a relatively new and experimental technique for multiplexing multiple channels of signals carried using electromagnetic radiation over a single path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tamburini|first1=Fabrizio|last2=Mari|first2=Elettra|last3=Sponselli|first3=Anna|last4=Thidé|first4=Bo|last5=Bianchini|first5=Antonio|last6=Romanato|first6=Filippo|date=2012-01-01|title=Encoding many channels on the same frequency through radio vorticity: first experimental test|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1367-2630/14/i=3/a=033001|journal=New Journal of Physics|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=033001|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/3/033001|issn=1367-2630|arxiv=1107.2348|bibcode=2012NJPh...14c3001T|s2cid=3570230}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can potentially be used in addition to other physical multiplexing methods to greatly expand the transmission capacity of such systems. {{As of|2012}} it is still in its early research phase, with small-scale laboratory demonstrations of bandwidths of up to 2.5 Tbit/s over a single light path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18551284|title='Twisted light' carries 2.5 terabits of data per second|work=BBC News|date=2012-06-25|accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a controversial subject in the academic community, with many claiming it is not a new method of multiplexing, but rather a special case of space-division multiplexing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tamagnone|first1=Michele|last2=Silva|first2=Joana S.|last3=Capdevila|first3=Santiago|last4=Mosig|first4=Juan R.|last5=Perruisseau-Carrier|first5=Julien|title=The orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing controversy: OAM as a subset of MIMO|journal=2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)|date=2015|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code-division multiplexing===
[[Code division multiplexing]] (CDM), [[Code division multiple access]] (CDMA) or [[spread spectrum]] is a class of techniques where several channels simultaneously share the same [[frequency spectrum]], and this spectral bandwidth is much higher than the bit rate or [[symbol rate]]. One form is frequency hopping, another is direct sequence spread spectrum. In the latter case, each channel transmits its bits as a coded channel-specific sequence of pulses called chips. Number of chips per bit, or chips per symbol, is the [[spreading factor]]. This coded transmission typically is accomplished by transmitting a unique time-dependent series of short pulses, which are placed within chip times within the larger bit time. All channels, each with a different code, can be transmitted on the same fiber or radio channel or other medium, and asynchronously demultiplexed. Advantages over conventional techniques are that variable bandwidth is possible (just as in [[statistical multiplexing]]), that the wide bandwidth allows poor signal-to-noise ratio according to [[Shannon-Hartley theorem]], and that multi-path propagation in wireless communication can be combated by [[rake receiver]]s.

A significant application of CDMA is the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).

==Multiple access method==
A multiplexing technique may be further extended into a [[multiple access method]] or [[channel access method]], for example, TDM into [[time-division multiple access]] (TDMA) and statistical multiplexing into [[carrier-sense multiple access]] (CSMA). A multiple access method makes it possible for several transmitters connected to the same physical medium to share its capacity.

Multiplexing is provided by the [[Physical layer|Physical Layer]] of the [[OSI model]], while multiple access also involves a [[media access control]] protocol, which is part of the [[data link layer|Data Link Layer]].

The Transport layer in the OSI model, as well as TCP/IP model, provides statistical multiplexing of several application layer data flows to/from the same computer.

[[Code-division multiplexing]] (CDM) is a technique in which each channel transmits its bits as a coded channel-specific sequence of pulses. This coded transmission typically is accomplished by transmitting a unique time-dependent series of short pulses, which are placed within chip times within the larger bit time. All channels, each with a different code, can be transmitted on the same fiber and asynchronously demultiplexed. Other widely used multiple access techniques are [[time-division multiple access]] (TDMA) and [[frequency-division multiple access]] (FDMA).
Code-division multiplex techniques are used as an access technology, namely code-division multiple access (CDMA), in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) standard for the third-generation (3G) mobile communication identified by the ITU.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Application areas==

===Telegraphy===
The earliest communication technology using electrical wires, and therefore sharing an interest in the economies afforded by multiplexing, was the [[electric telegraph]]. Early experiments allowed two separate messages to travel in opposite directions simultaneously, first using an electric battery at both ends, then at only one end.

[[Émile Baudot]] developed a [[time-multiplexing]] system of multiple [[David E. Hughes|Hughes]] machines in the 1870s. In 1874, the [[quadruplex telegraph]] developed by [[Thomas Edison]] transmitted two messages in each direction simultaneously, for a total of four messages transiting the same wire at the same time. Several researchers were investigating [[acoustic telegraphy]], a [[frequency-division multiplexing]] technique, which led to the [[invention of the telephone]].

===Telephony===
In [[telephony]], a [[customer]]'s [[local loop|telephone line]] now typically ends at the [[remote concentrator]] box, where it is multiplexed along with other [[telephone line]]s for that [[neighborhood]] or other similar area. The multiplexed signal is then carried to the [[telephone exchange|central switching office]] on significantly fewer wires and for much further distances than a customer's line can practically go.  This is likewise also true for [[digital subscriber line]]s (DSL).

[[Fiber in the loop]] (FITL) is a common method of multiplexing, which uses [[optical fiber]] as the [[Backbone network|backbone]].  It not only connects [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] phone lines with the rest of the [[PSTN]], but also replaces DSL by connecting directly to [[Ethernet]] wired into the [[home]].  [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] is often the [[communications protocol]] used.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

[[Cable TV]] has long carried multiplexed [[television channel]]s, and late in the 20th century began offering the same services as [[telephone companies]].  [[IPTV]] also depends on multiplexing.

===Video processing===
{{Main|Demultiplexer (media file)}}
In [[video]] editing and processing systems, multiplexing refers to the process of interleaving audio and video into one coherent data stream.

In [[digital video]], such a transport stream is normally a feature of a [[container format (digital)|container format]] which may include [[metadata]] and other information, such as [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]. The audio and video streams may have variable bit rate. Software that produces such a transport stream and/or container is commonly called a [[statistical multiplexer]] or '''muxer'''. A '''demuxer''' is software that extracts or otherwise makes available for separate processing the components of such a stream or container.

===Digital broadcasting===
In [[digital television]] systems, several variable bit-rate data streams are multiplexed together to a fixed bitrate transport stream by means of [[statistical multiplexing]]. This makes it possible to transfer several video and audio channels simultaneously over the same frequency channel, together with various services. This may involve several [[standard definition television]] (SDTV) programmes (particularly on [[DVB-T]], [[DVB-S2]], [[ISDB]] and ATSC-C), or one [[HDTV]], possibly with a single SDTV companion channel over one 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;MHz-wide TV channel. The device that accomplishes this is called a [[statistical multiplexer]]. In several of these systems, the multiplexing results in an [[MPEG transport stream]]. The newer DVB standards DVB-S2 and [[DVB-T2]] has the capacity to carry several [[HDTV]] channels in one multiplex.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

In [[digital radio]], a multiplex (also known as an ensemble) is a number of radio stations that are grouped together. A multiplex is a stream of digital information that includes audio and other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radioandtvhelp.co.uk/interference/rtis_radio/DABmuxes_DABradio|title=All about DAB multiplexes|work=Radio &amp; Television Investigation Service|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[communications satellite]]s which carry [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[television network]]s and [[radio network]]s, this is known as '''multiple channel per carrier''' or '''MCPC'''. Where multiplexing is not practical (such as where there are different sources using a single [[transponder]]), [[single channel per carrier]] mode is used.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

===Analog broadcasting===
In [[FM broadcasting]] and other [[analog signal|analog]] [[radio]] media, multiplexing is a term commonly given to the process of adding [[subcarrier]]s to the audio signal before it enters the [[transmitter]], where [[modulation]] occurs. (In fact, the stereo multiplex signal can be generated using time-division multiplexing, by switching between the two (left channel and right channel) input signals at an ultrasonic rate (the subcarrier), and then filtering out the higher harmonics.)  Multiplexing in this sense is sometimes known as '''MPX''', which in turn is also an old term for [[stereophonic]] FM, seen on [[stereo system]]s since the 1960s.

==Other meanings==
In [[spectroscopy]] the term is used to indicate that the experiment is performed with a mixture of frequencies at once and their respective response unravelled afterwards using the [[Fourier transform]] principle.

In [[computer programming]], it may refer to using a single in-memory resource (such as a file handle) to handle multiple external resources (such as on-disk files).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Multiplexing filehandles with select() in perl
| url = http://www.perlfect.com/articles/select.shtml}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electrical multiplexing techniques do not require a physical &quot;[[multiplexer]]&quot; device, they refer to a &quot;[[keyboard matrix (music)|keyboard matrix]]&quot; or &quot;[[Charlieplexing]]&quot; design style:
* Multiplexing may refer to the design of a [[multiplexed display]] (non-multiplexed displays are immune to [[multiplexed display#&quot;Break up&quot;|break up]]).
* Multiplexing may refer to the design of a &quot;switch matrix&quot; (non-multiplexed buttons are immune to &quot;phantom keys&quot; and also immune to  [[Keyboard (computing)#Control processor|&quot;phantom key blocking&quot;]]).

In high-throughput [[DNA sequencing]], the term is used to indicate that some artificial sequences (often called ''barcodes'' or ''indexes'') have been added to link given sequence reads to a given sample, and thus allow for the sequencing of multiple samples in the same reaction.

[[Image:Seal of the United States National Communications System.svg|right|thumb|NCS seal]]
The '''National Communications System''' ('''NCS''') was an office within the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] charged with enabling national security and emergency preparedness communications ([[NS/EP telecommunications]]) using the national telecommunications system. The NCS was disbanded by [[s:Executive Order 13618|Executive Order 13618]] on July 6, 2012.

==Background and history==
The genesis of the NCS began in 1962 after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] when communications problems among the United States, the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], and foreign heads of state threatened to complicate the crisis further. After the crisis, President [[John F. Kennedy]] ordered an investigation of national security communications, and the [[National Security Council (USA)|National Security Council]] (NSC) formed an interdepartmental committee to examine the communications networks and institute changes. This interdepartmental committee recommended the formation of a single unified communications system to serve the [[President of the United States|President]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], diplomatic and intelligence activities, and civilian leaders. Consequently, in order to provide better communications support to critical government functions during emergencies, President Kennedy established the National Communications System by a Presidential Memorandum on August 21, 1963. The NCS mandate included linking, improving, and extending the communications facilities and components of various Federal agencies, focusing on interconnectivity and survivability.

On April 3, 1984, President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed [[s:Executive Order 12472|Executive Order 12472]] which broadened the NCS' [[national security]] and [[emergency preparedness]] (NS/EP) capabilities and superseded President Kennedy's original 1963 memorandum. The NCS expanded from its original six members to an interagency group of 23 federal departments and agencies, and began coordinating and planning NS/EP telecommunications to support crises and disasters.

With the addition of the [[Director of National Intelligence|Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI) on September 30, 2007, the NCS membership currently stands at 24 members.

Each NCS member organization is represented on the NCS through the Committee of Principals (COP) – and its subordinate Council of Representatives (COR). The COP, formed as a result of Executive Order 12472, provides advice and recommendations to the NCS and the National Security Council through the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board on NS/EP telecommunications and its ties to other critical infrastructures. The NCS also participates in joint industry-Government planning through its work with the President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), with the NCS's National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications (NCC) and the NCC's subordinate Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC).

After nearly forty years with the Secretary of Defense serving as its Executive Agent, President [[George W. Bush]] transferred the National Communications System to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS). The NCS was one of 22 federal agencies transferred to the department on March 1, 2003, in accordance with [[s:Executive Order 13286|Executive Order 13286]]. A revised Executive Order 12472 reflects the changes of E.O. 13286. On November 15, 2005, the NCS became part of the department's Directorate for Preparedness after nearly two years under the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate. In March 2007 the NCS became an entity of the National Protection and Programs Directorate. The DHS Under Secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate served as the NCS Manager.

On July 6, 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] signed [[s:Executive Order 13618|Executive Order 13618]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary|Office of the Press Secretary]]|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/06/executive-order-assignment-national-security-and-emergency-preparedness-|title=Executive Order -- Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness Communications Functions|work=[[whitehouse.gov]]|publisher=[[White House]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|date=July 6, 2012|access-date=December 10, 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/07/11/2012-17022/assignment-of-national-security-and-emergency-preparedness-communications-functions|title=Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness Communications Functions|work=[[Federal Register]]|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|date=July 6, 2012|accessdate=October 8, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122011227/https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/07/11/2012-17022/assignment-of-national-security-and-emergency-preparedness-communications-functions|archivedate=November 22, 2016}} [https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-07-11/pdf/2012-17022.pdf Alt URL] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced Executive Order 12472, thus eliminating the NCS as a separate organization; it was merged into the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) of DHS' National Preparedness and Programs Directorate (NPPD) which had been created in 2007.  A ceremony to retire the colors of the NCS and to celebrate the legacy of the organization was held on August 30, 2012 in Arlington, VA.  Upon establishment of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) the OEC was renamed the Emergency Communications Division (ECD).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dhs.gov/cisa/emergency-communications&lt;/ref&gt;

The President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee helps strengthen [[National security of the United States|United States national security]], enhancing cybersecurity, maintaining the global communications infrastructure, assuring communications for disaster response, and addressing critical infrastructure interdependencies and dependencies. On September 29, 2017, President [[Donald Trump]] renewed several committees including the ''President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary|Office of the Press Secretary]]|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/29/presidential-executive-order-continuance-certain-federal-advisory|title=Presidential Executive Order on the Continuance of Certain Federal Advisory Committees|work=[[whitehouse.gov]]|publisher=[[White House]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|date=September 29, 2017|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hiv.gov/blog/president-trump-continues-pacha|title=President Trump Continues PACHA|first=B.

==Services ==
In fulfillment of their mission to enable emergency communications, the NCS has created a number of different services.
*NS/EP Priority Telecommunications
**'''[[Government Emergency Telecommunications Service]]''' (GETS) - provides emergency access and priority processing in the local and long distance segments of the public switched wireline network. Used in an emergency or crisis situation during which the probability of completing a call over normal or other alternate telecommunication means has significantly decreased.
**'''Telecommunications Service Priority''' (TSP) - provides service vendors with a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate for prioritizing service requests by identifying those services critical to NS/EP. A telecommunications service with a TSP assignment is assured of receiving full attention by the service vendor before a non-TSP service. 
** '''[[Nationwide Wireless Priority Service|Wireless Priority Service]]''' (WPS) - provides priority cellular network access. The WPS was approved by the FCC for NS/EP requirements on a call-by-call priority basis. The NCS executes the program on behalf of the Executive Office of the President. Only individuals in NS/EP key leadership positions are authorized use of WPS.
*'''National Coordinating Center''' (NCC) for Telecommunications
**'''Alerting and Coordination Network''' (ACN) - The Alerting and Coordination Network (ACN) provides a stable emergency voice communications network connecting telecommunications service providers’ [[Emergency Operations Center]]s (EOCs) and [[Network Operations Center]]s (NOCs) to support national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications network restoration coordination, transmission of telecommunications requirements and priorities, and incident reporting when the [[public switched telephone network|Public Switched Network]] (PSN) is inoperable, stressed or congested. It is engineered to provide a reliable and survivable network capability, and, as such, has no logical dependency on the PSN. As a result, if the PSN suffers disruptions, the ACN will not be affected.
**'''Shared Resources High Frequency Radio Program''' (SHARES) - The SHARES HF Radio Program brings together the assets of over 1,000 HF radio stations worldwide to voluntarily pass emergency messages when normal communications are destroyed or unavailable. SHARES uses common radio operating and message formatting procedures and more than 250 designated frequencies. Participation in SHARES is open to all Federal departments and agencies and their designated affiliates on a voluntary basis. More than 90 Federal, state, and industry organizations currently contribute resources throughout the United States and in 26 countries and U.S. possessions{{sfn|Schimmel|1994|pages=95–97}}
**'''Telecom ISAC''' - In January 2000, the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism designated the NCC-ISAC as the ISAC for telecommunications. On March 1, 2000, the NCC-ISAC commenced operations. The initial NCC-ISAC membership is based on NCC membership, which is evolving to reflect a broader base of technologies comprising the telecommunications infrastructure. NCC-ISAC will support the mission assigned by Executive Order 12472 and the national critical infrastructure protection goals of government and industry. The NCC-ISAC will facilitate voluntary collaboration and information sharing among its participants gathering information on vulnerabilities, threats, intrusions, and anomalies from telecommunications industry, government, and other sources. The NCC-ISAC will analyze the data with the goal of averting or mitigating impact upon the telecommunications infrastructure. Additionally, data will be used to establish baseline statistics and patterns and maintained to provide a library of historical data. Results will be sanitized and disseminated in accordance with sharing agreements established for that purpose by the NCC-ISAC participants.
*'''Emergency Response Training''' (ERT)
**'''Planning, Training, and Exercise Support''' (PTE) - Our mission is to ensure NCS readiness, enhance partnerships within government and industry, coordinate telecommunications operational planning among NCS elements, develop emergency response requirements, and to provide skilled civilians and reservists during crises and emergencies.
**'''Individual Mobilization Augmentee''' (IMA) - The National Communications System (NCS) Augmentee Program was established in 1988 to provide a cadre of skilled civilian and military reservists to enhance the efforts of the Office of the Manager, NCS (OMNCS), the National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications (NCC), and NCS Regional Managers (RMs) during national crises and emergencies. The NCS Augmentee Program consists of two components: the civilian members of the National Defense Executive Reserve (NDER) and the U.S. Army reservists participating in the Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) Program.

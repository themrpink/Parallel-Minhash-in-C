===Responsibilities===

* ''Coordinators.'' The primary responsibility of the regular coordinators for the WikiProject, as well as the page coordinators, are the maintenance and housekeeping work involved in keeping the project and its internal processes running smoothly; this includes a variety of tasks, such as keeping the announcement and open task lists updated, overseeing the assessment and review processes, managing the proposal and creation of task forces, and so forth. 

:There is fairly little involved that couldn't theoretically be done by any other editor, of course, in only a few places have the coordinators been explicitly written into a process, but since experience suggests that people tend to assume that someone else is doing whatever needs to be done, it has proven beneficial to formally delegate responsibility for this administrative work to a specified group.

: The coordinators also have several additional roles. They serve as the project's designated points of contact, and are explicitly listed as people to whom questions can be directed in a variety of places around the project. In addition, they have (highly informal) roles in leading the drafting of project guidelines, overseeing the implementation of project decisions on issues like category schemes and template use, and helping to resolve disputes and keep discussions from becoming heated and unproductive.

* ''Page Coordinators.'' Page coordinators can do the roles above as well, but they do so mainly as facilitators to keep the page itself formatted and up to date, to facilitate discussion here on this page to proceed smoothly, and to encourage a full and free exchange of useful and helpful information to occur on the pages of this WikIProject. 

* ''Working Group Coordinators.'' These coordinate any of one or more of the four core working groups for this WikiProject. &quot;Working Groups&quot; are defined as groups that correlate with the widely-accepted core functions of all WikiProjects, throughout Wikipedia; the existence of these Working Groups is on a semi-permanent basis, regardless of whether they have any members or not. 

* ''Task Force Coordinators.'' These coordinate any of one or more of the Task Forces for this WikiProject. Task Forces are centered around a specific task that pertains either to the core subject area, or some specific task or project, that is specific to the WikiProject itself. they can change, be created, or dissolved, based on the changing needs and activities of the WikiProject. therefore, for WikiProject History, there are some task forces that are centered upon historical topics, others upon historical eras, and various others for sundry types of areas. these are subject to continual change and development, as the project itself may dictate. 
* ''Assistant Coordinators.'' Editors who fulfill specific roles to assist coordinators in specific project areas and tasks. 
===Supplemental roles===
* ''WikiProject Members.'' Editors who are active members of this WIkiProject.
* ''WikiProject Volunteers.'' Editors who volunteer to help with specific efforts or activities at this WikiProject. 
* ''WikiProject Liaisons.'' Editors or coordinators from other Wikiprojects.
* ''Admin Partners.'' Admins who serve in a supporting role to regularly communicate to provide assistance as needed. 
* ''Project Consultants.'' These are any editors who seek to provide input or assistance to the project on a periodic basis, but do not seek to take on any administrative duties here. so these could include coordinators or editors from other WikiProjects who wish to help out, any experienced editors, any admins who wish to help out or, or absolutely any other interested editors at all, regardless of their experience, who simply wish to provide their input or assistance, at any time, and wish to volunteer for some support role here to do so.

===Informal subgroups===

[[Image:Coffee.jpg|noframe|90px|left]] 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Informal subgroups are any individual subgroup that any editor wishes to set up, on an informal or formal basis, for the purpose of gathering any group of editors together. This will be to enable editors to form their own subgroups for working with and communicating with other editors, but &lt;u&gt;without&lt;/u&gt; taking on the formal roles and responsibilities of an official task force. 

These subgroups could be formed based on any criteria at all. so any editor could form a subgroup for communicating with editors who are new to this topical area. or it could be an informal group for brainstorming ideas for a particular topic, or a particular editing drive, or group effort, or for a specific effort to delve into a particular topic, or to set up a single new article or set of articles, or for any other reason.

Our reason for setting up this new type of subgrouping is simple; history is a very broad and varied field. We would like to encourage all editors to take an active role here, as much as they might wish. so if you wish to set up any such subgroup, please feel free to post a notice on the talk page. We will be glad to help to promote any such efforts here. thanks!!

===Task forces===
&lt;!---WikiProject History has no task forces yet. Some may be introduced to work on specific areas if needed.---&gt;
[[Image:Nuvola apps agent.png|noframe|48px|left]] &lt;big&gt;Task forces are where the major work of the WikiProject gets done.&lt;/big&gt; 

We will have Task Forces set up here to  write about each of the topical areas covered by WikiProject History.

Please choose a Task Force below that matches the area that you most wish to work on. If you don't see an area listed that you want to work on, then please feel free to simply add it. thanks!!!!

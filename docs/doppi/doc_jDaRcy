The screen is placed atop a substrate. Ink is placed on top of the screen, and a floodbar is used to push the ink through the holes in the mesh. The operator begins with the fill bar at the rear of the screen and behind a reservoir of ink. The operator lifts the screen to prevent contact with the substrate and then using a slight amount of downward force pulls the fill bar to the front of the screen. This effectively fills the mesh openings with ink and moves the ink reservoir to the front of the screen. The operator then uses a [[squeegee]] (rubber blade) to move the mesh down to the substrate and pushes the squeegee to the rear of the screen. The ink that is in the mesh opening is pumped or squeezed by capillary action to the substrate in a controlled and prescribed amount, i.e. the wet ink deposit is proportional to the thickness of the mesh and or stencil. As the squeegee moves toward the rear of the screen the tension of the mesh pulls the mesh up away from the substrate (called snap-off) leaving the ink upon the substrate surface.

There are three common types of screen printing presses: flat-bed, cylinder, and rotary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenprinting-technology.org/en/applications/screen-printing-variations/flatbed-cylinder-screen-printing.html|title=Flatbed cylinder screen printing|website=Screenprinting Technology|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414011500/http://www.screenprinting-technology.org/en/applications/screen-printing-variations/flatbed-cylinder-screen-printing.html|archivedate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Textile items printed with multi-coloured designs often use a wet on wet technique, or colours dried while on the press, while graphic items are allowed to dry between colours that are then printed with another screen and often in a different colour after the product is re-aligned on the press.

Most screens are ready for re-coating at this stage, but sometimes screens will have to undergo a further step in the reclaiming process called dehazing. This additional step removes haze or &quot;ghost images&quot; left behind in the screen once the emulsion has been removed. Ghost images tend to faintly outline the open areas of previous stencils, hence the name. They are the result of ink residue trapped in the mesh, often in the knuckles of the mesh (the points where threads cross).

While the public thinks of garments in conjunction with screen printing, the technique is used on tens of thousands of items, including decals, clock and watch faces, balloons, and many other products.  The technique has even been adapted for more advanced uses, such as laying down conductors and resistors in multi-layer circuits using thin ceramic layers as the substrate.

==Stencilling techniques==

[[File:Ssc.jpg|right|thumb|A [[macro photography|macro photo]] of a screen print with a photographically produced [[stencil]]. The ink will be printed where the stencil does not cover the substrate.]]
A method of stencilling that has increased in popularity over the past years is the [[photo emulsion]] technique:
[[File:Hand painted color separation on transparent overlay.png|thumb|Hand-painted colour separation on transparent overlay by serigraph printer [[Csaba Markus]]]]
# The original image is created on a transparent overlay, and the image may be drawn or painted directly on the overlay, [[photocopier|photocopied]], or printed with a computer printer, but making so that the areas to be inked are not transparent. Any material that blocks ultra violet light can be used as the film, even card stock. A black-and-white positive may also be used (projected onto the screen).  However, unlike traditional plate-making, these screens are normally exposed by using film positives.
# A screen must then be selected. There are several different mesh counts that can be used depending on the detail of the design being printed. Once a screen is selected, the screen must be coated with emulsion and dried.  Once dry, it is then possible to burn/expose the print.
# The overlay is placed over the screen, and then exposed with a light source containing ultraviolet light in the 350-420 nanometer spectrum.
# The screen is washed off thoroughly. The areas of emulsion that were not exposed to light dissolve and wash away, leaving a negative stencil of the image on the mesh.

== Garment printing inks ==
;Caviar beads
:A caviar bead is a glue that is printed in the shape of the design, to which small plastic beads are then applied – works well with solid block areas creating an interesting tactile surface.
;Cracking ink
:Ink may be so applied as to produce a cracked surface after drying. Similar cracking may occur unintentionally if the ink does not cure fully.
;Discharge inks
:Discharge inks use Zinc Formaldehyde Sulfoxylate to activate the dye in fabric to discharge from the originating fabric. Discharge inks are available in clear or colours. Cons of using discharge inks is that the process only works properly on dark fabrics that have a content of 100% cotton. Fabrics with under-dyes and fabric blends will discharge their dye to different degrees. The fumes resulting from the application and curing are pungent and strong ventilation and a face mask are commonly needed to relieve exposure. Pros to this process is that discharge is especially effective for distressed prints and under-basing on dark garments that are to be printed with additional layers of plastisol. It adds variety to the design and gives it that natural soft feel.
;Expanding ink (puff)
:Expanding ink, or puff, is an additive to plastisol inks which raises the print off the garment, creating a 3D feel and look to the design. Mostly used when printing on apparel. 
;Flocking
:Flocking consists of a glue printed onto the fabric and then flock material is applied for a velvet touch. 
;Foil
:Foil is much like flock, starting with an adhesive glue or plastisol ink base layer. Foil is finished by applying a thin sheet of reflective/mirror like material on top of the screened base, then heat pressed to set. The foil substrate does not adhere to non-screened areas of the design, and the balance of the foil sheet is discarded. 
;Four-colour process or the [[CMYK colour model]]
:Four-colour process is when the artwork is created and then separated into four colours (CMYK) which combine to create the full spectrum of colours needed for photographic prints. This means a large number of colours can be simulated using only 4 screens, reducing costs, time, and set-up. The inks are required to blend and are more translucent, meaning a compromise with vibrancy of colour.
;Glitter/shimmer
:Glitter or shimmer ink is when metallic flakes become an additive in the ink base to create this sparkle effect. Usually available in gold or silver but can be mixed to make most colours.
;Gloss
:Gloss ink is when a clear base laid over previously printed inks to create a shiny finish.
;Metallic
:Metallic ink is similar to glitter, but smaller particles suspended in the ink. A glue is printed onto the fabric, then nano-scale fibers applied on it. This is often purchased already made. 
;Mirrored silver
:Mirrored silver is a highly reflective, solvent-based ink.
;Nylobond
:Nylobond is a special ink additive for printing onto technical or waterproof fabrics.
;[[Plastisol]]
:Plastisol is the most common ink used in commercial garment decoration. Good colour opacity onto dark garments and clear graphic detail with, as the name suggests, a more plasticized texture. This print can be made softer with special additives or heavier by adding extra layers of ink. Plastisol inks require heat (approx. 150 °C (300 °F) for many inks) to cure the print.
;PVC and phthalate free
:PVC and phthalate free is relatively new breed of ink and printing with the benefits of plastisol but without the two main toxic components. It also has a soft texture.
;Suede ink
:Suede ink is a milky coloured additive that is added to plastisol. With suede additive you can make any colour of plastisol have a suede feel. It is actually a puff blowing agent that does not bubble as much as regular puff ink. The directions vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, but generally up to 50% suede can be added to normal plastisol.
;Water-based inks
:these penetrate the fabric more than the plastisol inks and create a much softer feel. Ideal for printing darker inks onto lighter coloured garments. Also useful for larger area prints where texture is important. Some inks require heat or an added catalyst to make the print permanent.
;High density
:High density is a process which uses a type of varnish against a lower mesh count with many coats of emulsion or a thicker grade of emulsion (e.g., Capillex®). After the varnish passes through to the substrate, an embossed-appearing, 'raised' area of varnish is created. When cured at the end of the process, the varnish yields a Braille effect, hence the term 'high density'.

==Versatility==
[[File:Maker Faire 2008 San Mateo 246.JPG|thumb|Screen with exposed image ready to be printed.]]
Screen printing is more versatile than traditional printing techniques. The surface does not have to be printed under pressure, unlike [[etching]] or [[lithography]], and it does not have to be planar.  Different inks can be used to work with a variety of materials, such as textiles,  ceramics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fespa.com/news/features/understanding-ceramic-and-glass-decorating-techniques.html |title=Understanding ceramic and glass decorating - Techniques |first=Peter |last=Kiddell |work=FESPA |date=2015-06-26 |accessdate=2015-07-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707082610/http://www.fespa.com/news/features/understanding-ceramic-and-glass-decorating-techniques.html |archivedate=2015-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; wood, paper, glass, metal, and plastic.  As a result, screen printing is used in many different industries, including:
* [[Balloon]]s
* [[Clothing]]
* [[Decals]]
* [[Medical devices]]
* [[Printed electronics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fespa.com/news/blogs/printed-electronics-a-new-world-of-opportunity.html |title=Printed electronics: A new world of opportunity |date=2015-03-10 |work=FESPA |accessdate=2015-07-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707053928/http://www.fespa.com/news/blogs/printed-electronics-a-new-world-of-opportunity.html |archivedate=2015-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Printed circuit board|circuit board printing]]
* Product labels
* Signs and displays
* [[Snowboard]] graphics
* Textile [[fabric]]
* [[Thick film technology]]
* [[Pinball]] machines

== Semiconducting material ==
In screen printing on wafer-based solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, the mesh and buses of silver are printed on the front; furthermore, the buses of silver are printed on the back. Subsequently, aluminum paste is dispensed over the whole surface of the back for [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] and surface reflection. One of the parameters that can vary and can be controlled in screen printing is the thickness of the print. This makes it useful for some of the techniques of printing solar cells, electronics etc.

[[Solar wafer]]s are becoming thinner and larger, so careful printing is required to maintain a lower breakage rate, though high throughput at the printing stage improves the throughput of the whole cell production line.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Screen printing press ==
To print multiple copies of the screen design on garments in an efficient manner, amateur and professional printers usually use a screen printing press. Many companies offer simple to sophisticated printing presses. These presses come in one of three types, Manual (also referred to as Handbench), Semi-Automatic, and Fully Automatic.  Most printing companies will use one or more semi-automatic or fully automatic machines.

== Rotary screen printing ==
A development of screen printing with flat screens from 1963 was to wrap the screen around to form a tube, with the ink supply and squeegee inside the tube.  The resulting roller rotates at the same speed as the web in a roll-to-roll machine.  The benefits are high output rates and long rolls of product.  This is the only way to make high-build fully patterned printing/coating as a continuous process, and has been widely used for manufacturing textured wallpapers.

'''Ben K. Green''' (1912–1974) was an author who wrote about horses and the post-World War I [[American West]].  His books consist of [[anecdote]]s drawn from his own experiences in the Southwestern United States.

He was born in [[Cumby, Texas]] and raised in [[Weatherford, Texas]]. Before he was twenty years old he had successfully earned a living trading horses and mules and raising cattle and sheep.  The common trading practice{{snd}}&quot;cheat or be cheated&quot;{{snd}}is reflected in his stories, told using the language and humor of the area and not excluding himself from either outcome.

It is often said that he studied at [[Cornell University]] and in England but Cornell University has no record of this, and he did not ever become a certified or licensed doctor of veterinary medicine according to records from the Texas State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  He was persuaded to settle in [[Fort Stockton, Texas]] and practiced in the entire [[Trans-Pecos]] Region.  A large part of his work involved identifying plants which grew in that [[alkali]] soil and contained substances poisonous to horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs ([[Agave lechuguilla|lechuguilla]], [[yellow-weed]], [[pinguey]], [[locoweed]]).&lt;ref&gt;Green, ''The Village Horse Doctor'', Knopf, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Printmaking''' is the process of creating [[work of art|artwork]]s by [[printing]], normally on [[paper]]. Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints that have an element of originality, rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting.  Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print.  Each print produced is considered an &quot;original&quot; work of art, and is correctly referred to as an &quot;impression&quot;, not a &quot;copy&quot; (that means a different print copying the first, common in early printmaking).  Often impressions vary considerably, whether intentionally or not.  The images on most prints are created for that purpose, perhaps with a preparatory study such as a drawing.  A print that copies another work of art, especially a painting, is known as a &quot;reproductive print&quot;.

Prints are created by transferring ink from a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] to a sheet of paper or other material, by a variety of techniques. Common types of matrices include: metal plates, usually copper or zinc, or polymer plates and other thicker plastic sheets for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, aluminum, or polymer for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s and [[wood engraving]]s; and linoleum for [[linocut]]s. Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the [[screen printing]] process. Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below.

Multiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. Since the late 19th century, artists have generally signed individual impressions from an edition and often number the impressions to form a limited edition; the matrix is then destroyed so that no more prints can be produced. Prints may also be printed in book form, such as illustrated books or [[artist's book]]s.

== Techniques ==

=== Overview===
Printmaking techniques are generally divided into the following basic categories:
* [[relief print|Relief]], where ink is applied to the original surface of the matrix. Relief techniques include [[woodcut]] or [[woodblock printing|woodblock]] as the Asian forms are usually known, [[wood engraving]], [[linocut]] and [[metalcut]].
* [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]], where ink is applied beneath the original surface of the matrix. Intaglio techniques include [[engraving]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[aquatint]].
* [[Planographic]], where the matrix retains its original surface, but is specially prepared and/or inked to allow for the transfer of the image. Planographic techniques include [[lithography]], [[monotyping]], and digital techniques.
* [[Stencil]], where ink or paint is pressed through a prepared screen, including [[screen printing]] and [[stencil|pochoir]].

Other types of printmaking techniques outside these groups include [[collagraph]]y and [[viscosity printing]]. Collagraphy is a printmaking technique in which textured material is adhered to the printing matrix. This texture is transferred to the paper during the printing process. [[Printing#Modern printing technology|Contemporary printmaking]] may include [[digital printing]], photographic mediums, or a combination of digital, photographic, and traditional processes.

Many of these techniques can also be combined, especially within the same family. For example, Rembrandt's prints are usually referred to as &quot;etchings&quot; for convenience, but very often include work in engraving and [[drypoint]] as well, and sometimes have no etching at all.

=== Woodcut ===

Woodcut, a type of [[relief print]], is the earliest printmaking technique, and the only one traditionally used in the Far East. It was probably first developed as a means of printing patterns on cloth, and by the 5th century was used in China for printing text and images on paper. Woodcuts of images on paper developed around 1400 in Japan, and slightly later in Europe. These are the two areas where woodcut has been most extensively used purely as a process for making images without text.

The [[artist]] draws a design on a plank of [[wood]], or on paper which is transferred to the wood. Traditionally the artist then handed the work to a specialist cutter, who then uses sharp tools to carve away the parts of the block that will not receive ink. The surface of the block is then inked with the use of a [[brayer]], and then a sheet of [[paper]], perhaps slightly damp, is placed over the block. The block is then rubbed with a [[Baren (printing tool)|baren]] or [[spoon]], or is run through a [[printing press]]. If in color, separate blocks can be used for each [[color]], or a technique called reduction printing can be used.

Reduction printing is a name used to describe the process of using one block to print several layers of color on one print. This usually involves cutting a small amount of the block away, and then printing the block many times over on different sheets before washing the block, cutting more away and printing the next color on top. This allows the previous color to show through. This process can be repeated many times over. The advantages of this process is that only one block is needed, and that different components of an intricate design will line up perfectly. The disadvantage is that once the artist moves on to the next layer, no more prints can be made.

Another variation of woodcut printmaking is the cukil technique, made famous by the [[Taring Padi]] underground community in Java, Indonesia. Taring Padi Posters usually resemble intricately printed cartoon posters embedded with political messages. Images—usually resembling a visually complex scenario—are carved unto a wooden surface called cukilan, then smothered with printer's ink before pressing it unto media such as paper or canvas.

The process was developed in Germany in the 1430s from the engraving used by [[goldsmith]]s to decorate metalwork.  Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] to cut the design into the surface of a metal plate, traditionally made of copper. Engraving using a burin is generally a difficult skill to learn.

According to Dave Lewis, &quot;The direct, hard-hitting nature of the seven recordings failed to connect with a fan base more accustomed to the diversity and experimental edge of their previous work.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=45}} Page later acknowledged that, because the album conveys a sense of urgency resulting from the troubled circumstances in which it was recorded, &quot;it's not an easy album for a lot of people to access&amp;nbsp;...

A remastered version of ''Presence'', along with ''[[In Through the Out Door#2015 reissue|In Through the Out Door]]'' and ''[[Coda (album)#2015 reissue|Coda]]'' were reissued on 31 July 2015. The reissue comes in six formats, including CD, vinyl and digital download. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material containing alternative takes and one previously unreleased instrumental, &quot;10 Ribs &amp; All/Carrot Pod Pod&quot;. The reissue was released with an altered colour version of the original album's artwork as the bonus disc's cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grow|first=Kory|date=3 June 2015|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/led-zeppelin-announce-final-three-deluxe-reissues-20150603|title=Led Zeppelin Announce Final Three Deluxe Reissues|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reissue received generally positive reviews. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 77, based on eight reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt; ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote, &quot;It might be their weakest album, but ''Presence'' is among the most special; none of these songs sound like they could have come from another record.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PF&quot;/&gt; ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' said the original album is grand &quot;in lyric form and musical scale&quot;, while &quot;the discs of 'companion audio,' often short on revelation, here reveal a moment of sheer anomaly. '10 Ribs &amp; All/Carrot Pod Pod (Pod)' is whatever that title may mean, everything the LP is not: a tender piano piece.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Uncut&quot;/&gt; ''[[PopMatters]]'' was less impressed, saying &quot;like the rest of the re-releases, the bonus material leaves too much to be desired&quot;, but concluded, &quot;despite its weak second half, ''Presence'' is too good of an album to be dismissed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot;/&gt;

'''This is an archive only of bug reports from Phase II of the Wikipedia software (used before [[June 20]], [[2002]]). Please see [[Wikipedia:Bug reports]] for instructions on adding bug reports for the current system.'''

=== el error, imagino de poca importancia, es que he notado una pequeña singularidad ;  si usted va a una página especial tal como [ [ special:NewPages ] ] directamente, los menús del borde de la página son celestes, como deben ser, pero si usted va allí directamente,redirigiendo por ejemplo [ [ los nuevos asuntos ] ] los menús del bode siguen siendo blancos como si fuera una página normal [ [ user:Bryan Derksen|Bryan Derksen ] ]

=== Case-insensitive wiki's ===
(2002/5/30) I note that the [[ sytax for internal links requires proper capitalization. I like my capitalization to be &quot;proper&quot; and thus use the | syntax all the time to allow the link to work. This is all the more frustrating because many of the entries have incorrect capitalization.

This could all be fixed if the wiki's were case-insensitive in the same way the search is. Or am I missing something obvious?

:I copied this to bug reports, because I'm ''pretty'' sure it's new behaviour. -- [[user:Marj Tiefert|Marj Tiefert]], Thursday, May 30, 2002

:No, it's always worked like that so far as I know. Some of the non-English wikis have been on a really ugly system whereby Every Word In A Title Had Its First Letter Capitalized Like This Which Is Really Fricking Annoying And I Am Really Glad That We're Getting Rid Of It There Because Oh-Man-Oh-Man It's Ugly Isn't It? But we haven't had that here on the English wiki, thank goodness; it's case-sensitive except for the very first letter of a title, which is always capitalized in the title and can be either way in a link (ie, [[Asteroid]] and [[asteroid]] are the same article). Certainly it's been that way at least since mid-January when I got here. If you want your capitalization proper, please fix the articles that have inproper capitalization.

'''Backslashes don't display''', Wednesday, May 29, 2002

See [[Blackboard_bold]] for two examples. This is a new bug, since they used to work. --[[user:Zundark|Zundark]], Wednesday, May 29, 2002

:This is an instance of the cache bug: the displayed page was not the current page, but an old cached version. Re-saving the page fixed the problem. [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]], Wednesday, May 29, 2002

::[[ASCII]], on the other hand, is an actual instance of backslashes not displaying. I've fixed it twice now. Each time, the backslash displays immediately after saving the page, but if I then reload the page the backslash goes away again. [[user:Bryan Derksen|Bryan Derksen]], Wednesday, May 29, 2002

::I can't find a description of the cache bug at the moment, but your (Axel's) description appears to be wrong. Re-saving the page had no effect, it only made it look as if the problem was fixed because you were no longer seeing a cached version. Reload/refresh the page and the backslashes will disappear again. See [[Eigenvector]] and [[Matrix]] for some particularly obvious examples. --[[user:Zundark|Zundark]], Sunday, June 9, 2002

:::Correct, saving a page in cache stripped backslashes. It's now fixed in CVS. [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]], Sunday, June 9, 2002

'''Several asterisks in a row will prevent linewraps (or increase the linewrap length considerably?)''' [[user:Koyaanis Qatsi|Koyaanis Qatsi]], Monday, April 8, 2002

See the history of [[Talk:Terrists]] for an example.  I doubt this is a common issue, though, since most of us use four dashes.  :-)

:This is not a bug, so I'm going to move this to the &quot;fixed&quot; site.  Asterisks at the start of a line are used by the wiki software to make bullet lists, which can be nested.  A row of, say, 20 asterisks is asking the software to make 20 nested bullet lists, and it does so correctly.  It fails to wrap lines because bullet lists are indented, and when you ask for 20 indents, that line becomes very long to accommodate them, and it takes the rest of the page with it.  In short, DON'T DO THAT, because it's not ever going to change. -- [[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Daniel Crocker]]

'''Table positioned between two paragraphs displays at bottom of page'''&lt;br&gt;
''(possibly related to above bug??)'' Wednesday, April 10, 2002

If you look at the table in [[Talk:High_German]], you'll see that instead of appearing between the two paragraphs of my note, it leaves a &quot;close table&quot; tag where the table belongs and puts the table at the end of the page.  I've double-checked my table code for errors, and can't find any.  I've also tried just making one big table, with the first and last paragraphs in their own table rows, but the problem persists.  Is this a bug, or am I having a Stupid Attack™? [[user:pgdudda|pgdudda]]
:You're missing a &amp;lt;/center&amp;gt; tag; it looks okay after I added that in. But that did trigger a bug in the parser that caused it to eat the table instead of the center tag... I'll try to fix that, but in the meantime, uh, don't do that. :) [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Wednesday, April 10, 2002

::Oh, so I *was* having a Stupid Attack&amp;trade;, but at least my Stupid Attack helped uncover another bug.  Thanks!  :-)  [[user:pgdudda|pgdudda]] Thursday, April 11, 2002

'''Linking error 2/25/02'''

Oregon consititution had several articles with multiple spaces in them - so the link was [[Article II  (two spaces before this) title here]] instead of [[Article II title here]] and the link resolves to different locations.
[[justrob|Rob Salzman]]
:Hmm, I think this is semi-fixed. Anyone still seeing these kinds of errors? [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Friday, April 19, 2002

'''Last line link in list'''

(2002/1/29) If the last lines of an article looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;* [http://www.yahoo.com/
Yahoo]
&lt;/pre&gt;
then the bottom part of the page (&quot;Main Page | Recent Changes...&quot;) will be indented to the left and screwed up. See [[SandBox]] for an example. This only happens
if all of the following are true:
# we are in a list
# we have an URL link

(2002/3/2) Right now, I see the bug also in Netscape. An example is at the bottom of [[Duverger's Law]]. [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]

:That page renders correctly for me on Mozilla 0.9.8 &amp;amp; Netscape 4.78 (Linux). The example in [[wikipedia:Sandbox]] still leaves an indent on the following page contents (which is due to a bug in the wiki-to-html rendering code), but not in the link bar at the bottom (which is now separated by a div tag, so there shouldn't be any interference).

A '''conservative force''' is a force with the property that the total [[Work (physics)|work]] done in moving a particle between two points is independent of the path taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pegrav.html#cfor HyperPhysics - Conservative force]&lt;/ref&gt;  Equivalently, if a particle travels in a closed loop, the total work done (the sum of the force acting along the path multiplied by the displacement) by a conservative force is zero.&lt;ref name=Hand&gt;{{cite book |title=Analytical Mechanics |author =Louis N. Hand, Janet D. Finch |page=41 |isbn=0-521-57572-9 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A conservative force depends only on the position of the object.  If a force is conservative, it is possible to assign a numerical value for the [[Scalar potential|potential]] at any point and conversely, when an object moves from one location to another, the force changes the [[potential energy]] of the object by an amount that does not depend on the path taken, contributing to the [[mechanical energy]] and the overall [[conservation of energy]]. If the force is not conservative, then defining a scalar potential is not possible, because taking different paths would lead to conflicting potential differences between the start and end points.

[[Gravitation|Gravitational force ]] is an example of a conservative force, while [[frictional force]] is an example of a non-conservative force.

Other examples of conservative forces are: force in elastic spring, electrostatic force between two electric charges, and magnetic force between two magnetic poles. The last two forces are called central forces as they act along the line joining the centres of two charged/magnetized bodies. A central force is conservative if and only if it is spherically symmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=John R.|title=Classical Mechanics|date=2005|publisher=Univ. Science Books|location=Sausalito, Calif.|isbn=1-891389-22-X|pages=133–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal definition==
Informally, a conservative force can be thought of as a force that ''conserves'' [[mechanical energy]]. Suppose a particle starts at point A, and there is a force ''F'' acting on it. Then the particle is moved around by other forces, and eventually ends up at A again. Though the particle may still be moving, at that instant when it passes point A again, it has traveled a closed path. If the net work done by ''F'' at this point is 0, then ''F'' passes the closed path test. Any force that passes the closed path test for all possible closed paths is classified as a conservative force.

The [[gravitational force]], [[Hooke's law|spring force]], [[magnetic force]] (according to some definitions, see below) and [[electric force]] (at least in a time-independent magnetic field, see [[Faraday's law of induction]] for details) are examples of conservative forces, while [[friction]] and [[air drag]] are classical examples of non-conservative forces.

For non-conservative forces, the mechanical energy that is lost (not conserved) has to go somewhere else, by [[conservation of energy]]. Usually the energy is turned into [[heat]], for example the heat generated by friction. In addition to heat, friction also often produces some [[sound]] energy. The water drag on a moving boat converts the boat's mechanical energy into not only heat and sound energy, but also wave energy at the edges of its [[wake]]. These and other energy losses are irreversible because of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

==Path independence==
[[Image:Conservative Force Gravity Example.svg|right|300px]]
A direct consequence of the closed path test is that the work done by a conservative force on a particle moving between any two points does not depend on the path taken by the particle.

This is illustrated in the figure to the right: The work done by the gravitational force on an object depends only on its change in height because the [[gravitational force]] is conservative. The work done by a conservative force is equal to the negative of change in potential energy during that process. For a proof, imagine two paths 1 and 2, both going from point A to point B. The variation of energy for the particle, taking path 1 from A to B and then path 2 backwards from B to A, is 0; thus, the work is the same in path 1 and 2, i.e., the work is independent of the path followed, as long as it goes from A to B.

For example, if a child slides down a frictionless slide, the work done by the gravitational force on the child from the start of the slide to the end is independent of the shape of the slide; it only depends on the vertical displacement of the child.

==Mathematical description==
A [[force field (physics)|force field]] ''F'', defined everywhere in space (or within a [[simply-connected]] volume of space), is called a ''conservative force'' or ''[[conservative vector field]]'' if it meets any of these three ''equivalent'' conditions:

{{ordered list
| The [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of ''F'' is the zero vector:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{F} = \vec{0}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
| There is zero net [[work (physics)|work]] (''W'') done by the force when moving a particle through a trajectory that starts and ends in the same place:
:&lt;math&gt;W \equiv \oint_C \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec r = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
| The force can be written as the negative [[gradient]] of a [[potential energy|potential]], &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = -\vec{\nabla} \Phi. \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

{| class=&quot;toccolours collapsible collapsed&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;
! Proof that these three conditions are equivalent when ''F'' is a [[force field (physics)|force field]]
|-
| {{Main|Conservative vector field}}
{{glossary}}
{{term|1 implies 2}}{{defn|
Let ''C'' be any simple closed path (i.e., a path that starts and ends at the same point and has no self-intersections), and consider a surface ''S'' of which ''C'' is the boundary. Then [[Stokes' theorem]] says that
:&lt;math&gt; \int_S \left(\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{F}\right) \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{a} = \oint_C \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r} &lt;/math&gt;
If the curl of '''F''' is zero the left hand side is zero - therefore statement 2 is true.
}}
{{term|2 implies 3}}{{defn|
Assume that statement 2 holds. Let ''c'' be a simple curve from the origin to a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and define a function
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = -\int_c \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r}.&lt;/math&gt;
The fact that this function is well-defined (independent of the choice of ''c'') follows from statement 2. Anyway, from the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], it follows that 
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = -\vec{\nabla} \Phi.&lt;/math&gt;
So statement 2 implies statement 3 ([[Gradient theorem#Converse of the gradient theorem|see full proof]]).
}}
{{term|3 implies 1}}{{defn|
Finally, assume that the third statement is true. A well-known vector calculus identity states that the curl of the gradient of any function is 0. (See [[Vector calculus identities#Curl of the gradient|proof]].) Therefore, if the third statement is true, then the first statement must be true as well.

This shows that statement 1 implies 2, 2 implies 3, and 3 implies 1. Therefore, all three are equivalent, [[Q.E.D.]].

(The equivalence of 1 and 3 is also known as (one aspect of) [[Helmholtz decomposition|Helmholtz's theorem]].)
}}
{{glossary end}}

The term ''conservative force'' comes from the fact that when a conservative force exists, it conserves mechanical energy. The most familiar conservative forces are [[gravity]], the [[electric force]] (in a time-independent magnetic field, see [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]), and [[Hooke's law|spring force]].

Many forces (particularly those that depend on velocity) are not [[force field (physics)|force ''fields'']]. In these cases, the above three conditions are not mathematically equivalent. For example, the [[magnetic force]] satisfies condition 2 (since the work done by a magnetic field on a charged particle is always zero), but does not satisfy condition 3, and condition 1 is not even defined (the force is not a vector field, so one cannot evaluate its curl). Accordingly, some authors classify the magnetic force as conservative,&lt;ref name=&quot;srivastava1997mechanics&quot;&gt;For example, {{Cite book|title=Mechanics|author=P. K. Srivastava|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCw_Hq53ipsC|year=2004|publisher=New Age International Pub. (P) Limited|access-date=2018-11-20|isbn=9788122411126|page=94}}: &quot;In general, a force which depends explicitly upon the velocity of the particle is not conservative. However, the magnetic force (q'''v'''×'''B''') can be included among conservative forces in the sense that it acts perpendicular to velocity and hence work done is always zero&quot;. [https://books.google.com/books?id=yCw_Hq53ipsC Web link]&lt;/ref&gt; while others do not.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Magnetic Universe: Geophysical and Astrophysical Dynamo Theory'', Rüdiger and Hollerbach, page 178, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRJO9gvkJo8C Web link]&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic force is an unusual case; most velocity-dependent forces, such as [[friction]], do not satisfy any of the three conditions, and therefore are unambiguously nonconservative.

==Non-conservative force==

Despite conservation of total energy, non-conservative forces can arise in classical physics due to neglected [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] or from time-dependent potentials.&lt;ref&gt;Friedhelm Kuypers. Klassische Mechanik. WILEY-VCH 2005. Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many non-conservative  forces may be perceived as macroscopic effects of small-scale conservative forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tom&quot;&gt;Tom W. B. Kibble, Frank H. Berkshire. Classical mechanics. (5th ed).  Imperial College Press 2004 {{ISBN|1860944248}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, friction may be treated without violating conservation of energy by considering the motion of individual molecules; however, that means every molecule's motion must be considered rather than handling it through statistical methods. For macroscopic systems the non-conservative approximation is far easier to deal with than millions of degrees of freedom.

Examples of non-conservative forces are [[friction]] and non-elastic material [[stress (mechanics)|stress]]. Friction has the effect of transferring some of the energy from the large-scale motion of the bodies to small-scale movements in their interior, and therefore appear non-conservative on a large scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tom&quot; /&gt; [[General relativity]] is non-conservative, as seen in the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|anomalous precession]] of Mercury's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;Remington Pitts. Mechanics and Waves. Scientific e-Resources 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, general relativity does conserve a [[stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor]].

By Karl Bodmer, [[aquatint]] made at [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] in March or April 1833 when Massika pleaded for the release of war chief Blackhawk following the [[Black Hawk War]].]]

The '''Sac''' or '''Sauk''' are a group of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s of the [[Eastern Woodlands]] culture group, who lived primarily in the region of what is now [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], when first encountered by the French in 1667.  Their [[endonym|autonym]] is '''oθaakiiwaki''', and their [[exonym]] is '''Ozaagii(-wag)''' in [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]].  The latter name was transliterated into [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] by colonists of those cultures. Today they have three federally recognized tribes, together with the [[Meskwaki]] (Fox), located in [[Iowa]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Kansas]].

==History==
[[File:Sauk Indian family by Frank Rinehart 1899.jpg|thumb|right|Sac Indian family photographed by [[Frank Rinehart]] in 1899]]

The Sauk, an [[Algonquian languages]] people, are believed to have developed as a people along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. They were driven west by pressure from other tribes, especially the powerful [[Iroquois League]] or ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'', which sought control over hunting grounds in the area.  Some historians believe that the Sauk migrated to what is now eastern [[Michigan]], where they settled around [[Saginaw Bay]] (Ojibwe: ''Zaagiinaad-wiikwed'' - &quot;Of the Outlet Bay&quot;).

The neighboring [[Anishinaabe|Anishanabeg]] [[Ojibwa|Ojibwe]] (Sauk name: Ochipwêwa) and [[Ottawa (tribe)|Odawa]] peoples referred to them by the [[exonym]] '''''Ozaagii(-wag)''''', meaning &quot;those at the outlet&quot;. French colonists transliterated that as ''Sac'' and the English as &quot;Sauk&quot;. The Sauk/Sac called themselves the 
[[endonym|autonym]] of '''Othâkîwa, Thâkîwa, Thâkîwaki''' or ''Asaki-waki/Oθaakiiwaki'' people of the yellow earth [(&quot;people coming forth [from the outlet],&quot; i.e., &quot;from the water&quot;)], which is often interpreted to mean &quot;yellow-earth people&quot; or &quot;the Yellow-Earths&quot;, due to the yellow-clay soils found around Saginaw Bay. This interpretation possibly derived from the Sauk words ''Athâwethiwa'' or ''Athâw(i)'' (&quot;yellow&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/sf_colors.htm Meskwaki-Sauk Color Words]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Neniwaki'' (&quot;men, people&quot;). This was later shortened to &quot;Asaki-waki&quot;. In addition, the [[Meskwaki|Fox (Meskwaki)]] were generally known among neighboring tribes as the &quot;people of the red earth&quot; - the Sauk and Fox also used this term: ''Êshkwîha'' or ''Meshkwahkîha'' (&quot;people of the red earth&quot;).

Some Ojibwe oral histories also place the Sauk in the Saginaw Valley some time before the arrival of Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/micounty/BAD1164.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext A][http://www.castlemuseum.org/saginaw-valley B]&lt;/ref&gt;

But, the Sauk may have been mistakenly recorded at this location near [[Lake Huron]] at that time. There is little archaeological evidence that the Sauk lived in the Saginaw area.&lt;ref name=&quot;kilar&quot;&gt;Jeremy W. Kilar, ''Saginaw's Changeable Past: An Illustrated History,''  St. Louis, MO: G. Bradley Publishers, 1994, p 15&lt;/ref&gt;In the early 17th century, when natives told French explorer Samuel de Champlain that the Sauk nation was located on the west shore of Lake Michigan, Champlain mistakenly placed them on the western shore of [[Lake Huron]]. This mistake was copied on subsequent maps, and future references identified this as the place of the Sauk. Champlain never visited what is now Michigan.&lt;ref name=&quot;kilar&quot;/&gt;  

[[Anishinaabe]] expansion and the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] attempt to gain regional stability drove the Sac out of their territory. The Huron were armed with guns supplied by their French trading partners. The Sac moved south to territory in parts of what are now northern [[Illinois]] and [[Wisconsin]]. In the seventeenth century the Sauk also maintained close relations with the [[Potawatomi]] (Pehkînenîha or Shîshîpêhinenîha). This relation has been found by borrowings of Sauk vocabulary that appear in the [[Potawatomi language]]. 

In a loose coalition of tribes - including [[Dakota people|Dakota]] (Ashâha), Ojibwe, Odawa, Potawatomi, [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] (Kîkâpôwa), Meskwaki (Fox), and Sauk, along with the [[Shawnee]] (Shâwanôwa), [[Cherokee]] (Shanahkîha), and [[Choctaw]] (Châkitâha) from the Southeast -  they attacked the tribes of the [[Illinois Confederation|Illinois Confederation (&quot;Illinois/Inoca&quot;)]] (Mashkotêwa) and tried to invade their tribal areas. The &quot;Illinois/Inoca&quot; became their worst common enemies. The coalition warred for years until they destroyed the Illinois Confederation. 

Later they moved out on the [[prairie]] (Mashkotêwi) along the Mississippi and adopted the semi-sedentary lifestyle of [[Plains Indians]] (Mashkotêwineniwa). In addition to [[American bison|hunting buffalo]], they lived in villages, raised crops, and actively traded with other tribes. The Sauk and allied eastern tribes had to compete with tribes who already occupied this territory. Disputes and clashes arose with the Dakota, [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] (Pânîha) and, most of all, the powerful [[Osage Nation|Osage]] (Washâsha).

The Sauk had good relations with the English (Thâkanâsha) through trading. At first, the Sauk had good relations with [[New France]] too, until their alliance with the Meskwaki (Fox) made them short-term enemies of the French (Mêmehtekôshîha, Wêmehtekôshîha).

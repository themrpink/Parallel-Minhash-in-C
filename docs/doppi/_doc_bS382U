In law, the terms '''moot''' and '''mootness''' have different meanings in [[British English]] and [[American English]].

In the [[Law of the United States|legal system of the United States]], a matter is '''moot''' if further legal proceedings with regard to it can have no effect, or events have placed it beyond the reach of the law.  Thereby the matter has been deprived of practical significance or rendered purely academic. The U.S. development of this word stems from the practice of [[moot court]]s, in which hypothetical or fictional cases were argued as a part of legal education.  These purely academic issues led the U.S. courts to describe cases where developing circumstances made any judgment ineffective as &quot;moot&quot;.  The doctrine can be compared to the [[ripeness]] doctrine, another judge-made rule, that holds that judges should not rule on cases based entirely on anticipated disputes or hypothetical facts.  Similar doctrines prevent the federal courts of the United States from issuing [[advisory opinion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=matthew_hall |last1=Hall |first1=Mathew I |title=The Partially Prudential Doctrine of Mootness |volume=77 |work=George Washington Law Review |page=562 |date=August 2008 |publisher=[[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]], [[McGeorge School of Law]] |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is different from the usage in the [[Law of the United Kingdom|British legal system]], where the term &quot;moot&quot; has the meaning of &quot;remains open to debate&quot; or unresolved. The shift in usage was first observed in the [[United States]] and the extent to which the term is used in U.S. jurisprudence and therefore the meaning attached to it has had the effect that it is rarely if ever used in a British courtroom.  It should not be confused with the term &quot;[[moot court]]&quot;, which refers to practice appellate arguments.

==U.S. federal courts==
In the U.S. federal judicial system, a moot case must be dismissed, there being a constitutional limitation on the jurisdiction 
of the federal courts. The reason for this is that [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] limits the jurisdiction of all federal courts to &quot;[[cases and controversies]]&quot;. Thus, a civil action or appeal in which the court's decision will not affect the rights of the parties is ordinarily beyond the power of the court to decide, provided it does not fall within one of the recognized exceptions.

A textbook example of such a case is the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[DeFunis v. Odegaard]]'', {{ussc|416|312|1974}}.  The plaintiff was a student who had been denied admission to [[law school]], and had then been provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case. Because the student was slated to graduate within a few months at the time the decision was rendered, and there was no action the law school could take to prevent that, the Court determined that a decision on its part would have no effect on the student's rights. Therefore, the case was dismissed as moot.

However, there is disagreement as to both the source of the standards, and their application in the courts.  Some courts and observers opine that cases ''must'' be dismissed because this is a constitutional bar, and there is no &quot;case or controversy&quot;; others have rejected the pure constitutional approach and adopted a so-called &quot;prudential&quot; view, where dismissal ''may'' depend upon a host of factors, whether the particular person has lost a viable interest in the case, or whether the issue itself survives outside the interests of the particular person, whether the circumstance are likely to recur, etc.  In actual practice, the U.S. federal courts have been uneven in their decisions, which has led to the accusation that determinations are ''[[ad hoc]]'' and 'result-oriented.'&lt;ref&gt;Hall, supra.{{page needed|date=August 2016}}{{nonspecific|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four major exceptions to this mootness rule. These are cases of &quot;voluntary cessation&quot; on the part of the [[defendant]]; questions that involve secondary or collateral legal consequences; questions that are &quot;capable of ''repetition,'' yet evading review&quot;; and questions involving [[class action]]s where the named party ceases to represent the class.

===Voluntary cessation===
Where a defendant is acting wrongfully, but ceases to engage in such conduct once a [[litigation]] has been threatened or commenced, the court will still not deem this correction to moot the case. Obviously, a party could stop acting improperly just long enough for the case to be dismissed and then resume the improper conduct. For example, in ''[[Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|528|167|2000}}, the Supreme Court held that an industrial polluter, against whom various deterrent civil penalties were being pursued, could not claim that the case was moot, even though the polluter had ceased polluting and had closed the factory responsible for the pollution. The court noted that so long as the polluter still retained its license to operate such a factory, it could open similar operations elsewhere if not deterred by the penalties sought.

Another example occurs when a court dismisses as &quot;moot&quot; a legal challenge to an existing law, where the law being challenged is either amended or repealed through legislation before the court case could be settled.  A recent instance of this occurred in ''[[Moore v. Madigan]],'' where Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan declined to appeal a ruling from the Seventh Circuit striking down Illinois' handgun carry ban to the [[United States Supreme Court]], as Illinois subsequently passed a law legalizing concealed carry with a state-issued license, which rendered the case moot.

===Secondary or collateral legal consequences===
&quot;The obvious fact of life is that most criminal convictions do in fact entail adverse collateral legal consequences. The mere possibility that this will be the case is enough to preserve a criminal case from ending ignominiously in the limbo of mootness.&quot; Sibron v. New York.

===Capable of repetition, yet evading review===
A court will allow a case to go forward if it is the type for which persons will frequently be faced with a particular situation, but will likely cease to be in a position where the court can provide a remedy for them in the time that it takes for the justice system to address their situation. The most frequently cited example is the 1973 United States Supreme Court case of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}, which challenged a [[Texas]] law forbidding [[abortion]] in most circumstances. The state argued that the case was moot because plaintiff [[Norma McCorvey|Roe]] was no longer pregnant by the time the case was heard.  As [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] wrote in the majority opinion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By contrast, in ''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]'', 2004, the case failed to proceed based on being moot, without [[standing (law)|standing]] and out of time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statute of limitations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court cited ''[[Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC]]'', {{ussc|219|498|1911}}, which had held that a case was not moot when it presented an issue that was &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review&quot;. Perhaps in response to increasing workloads at all levels of the judiciary, the recent trend in the Supreme Court and other U.S. courts has been to construe this exception rather narrowly.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Many cases fall under the &quot;capable of repetition&quot; doctrine; however, because there is a review process available under most circumstances, the exception to declaring mootness did not apply to such cases.  In ''Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft'', 436 U. S. 1, 8â€“9 (1978), the court noted that claims for [[damages]] save cases from mootness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-351.pdf |title=Slip: ''Alvarez v. Smith'' (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class action representatives===
Where a class action lawsuit is brought, with one named plaintiff actually representing the interests of many others, the case will not become moot even if the named plaintiff ceases to belong to the class that is seeking a remedy. In ''[[Sosna v. Iowa]]'', {{ussc|419|393|1975}}, the plaintiff represented a class that was challenging an [[Iowa]] law that required persons to reside there for a year before seeking a [[divorce]] in Iowa's courts. The Supreme Court held that, although the plaintiff successfully divorced in another state, her [[Lawyer|attorneys]] could continue to competently advance the interests of other members of the class.

==U.S. state courts==
The [[U.S. state]] courts are not subject to the Article III limitations on their jurisdiction, and some state courts are permitted by their local constitutions and laws to render opinions in moot cases where the establishment of a legal precedent is desirable.  They may also establish exceptions to the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hawaiiopinions.blogspot.com/2008/10/prejudice-pushes-aside-mootness.html Prejudice Pushes Aside Mootness Doctrine Hamilton v. Lethem] (HSC October 14, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in some state courts{{which|date=August 2019}} the prosecution can lodge an appeal after a defendant is acquitted: although the appellate court cannot set aside a not-guilty verdict due to [[double jeopardy]], it can issue a ruling as to whether a trial court's ruling on a particular issue during the trial was erroneous. This opinion will then be binding on future cases heard by the courts of that state.

Some U.S. states also accept [[certified question]]s from the federal courts or the courts of other states. Under these procedures, state courts can issue opinions, usually for the purpose of clarifying or updating state law, in cases not actually pending in those courts.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Indiana Rules of Appellate Procedure, Title XI, Rule 64, &quot;Certified Questions of State Law From Federal Courts&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the U.S.==
Although free from the U.S. Constitutional limitation, Canada has recognized that considerations of judicial economy and [[comity]] with the legislative and executive branch may justify a decision to dismiss an allegedly moot case, as deciding hypothetical controversies is tantamount to legislating.  Considerations of the effectiveness of advocacy involved in the adversarial system and the possibility of recurrence of an alleged constitutional violation may sway the court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dj_4_H35nmYC&amp;pg=PA286 Morton, Frederick Lee, (March 2002) ''Law, politics, and the judicial process in Canada'' (BPR Publishers) 660pp.] {{ISBN|978-1-55238-046-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the federal and provincial governments can ask for advisory opinions in hypothetical scenarios, termed [[reference question]]s, from their respective highest courts.

==Moot point==
The phrase '''[[wikt:moot point|moot point]]''' refers (in American English) to an issue that is irrelevant to a subject being discussed or, in British English, one that is debatable. Due to the relatively uncommon usage of the word moot, and because &quot;moot&quot; and &quot;mute&quot; are [[homophone]]s in some pronunciations, this is sometimes erroneously rendered as &quot;mute point&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/mute.html Mute Point/Moot Point], from Paul Brians, ''Common Errors in English Usage'' (3rd Edition), William, James Co. November, 2013 (retrieved April 16 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law]], a '''default''' is the failure to do something required by law or to appear
at a required time in legal proceedings.

In the [[United States]], for example, when a party has failed to file meaningful response to [[pleading]]s within
the time allowed, with the result that only one side of a controversy has been presented
to the court, the party who has pleaded a claim for relief and received no response may request entry of default. In some jurisdictions the court may proceed to enter judgment immediately: others require that the plaintiff file a
notice of intent to take the default judgment and serve it on the unresponsive party.
If this notice is not opposed, or no adequate justification for the delay or lack
of response is presented, then the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in his favor. Such a judgment is referred to as a &quot;[[default judgment]]&quot; and, unless otherwise ordered, has the same effect as a judgment entered in a contested case.

It is possible to [[vacate]] or remove the [[default judgment]], depending on the particular state's law.

Entry of default in the [[United States district court]]s is governed by Rule 55 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

'''Clare Majella Martin''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} (born 15 June 1952) is a former Australian journalist and politician. She was elected to the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] in a shock by-election win in 1995. She was appointed Opposition Leader in 1999, and won a surprise victory at the [[2001 Northern Territory general election|2001 territory election]], becoming the first [[Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)|Labor Party]] (ALP) and first female [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory]].  At the [[2005 Northern Territory general election|2005 election]], she led Territory Labor to the second-largest majority government in the history of the Territory, before resigning as Chief Minister on 26 November 2007.

==Early life==
Martin was one of ten children.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; Her parents were strong [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] and passionate [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]] supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;asn&quot;&gt;Finnane, Kieran: [http://www.alicespringsnews.com.au/0917.html Ideals a family tradition for Clare Martin], ''[[Alice Springs News]]'', 29 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Her uncle, [[Kevin Cairns (politician)|Kevin Cairns]], was a [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] minister and [[Australian House of Representatives|MP]] in the [[William McMahon|McMahon]] government, but the family was not inclined towards his conservative politics. Martin's ancestry includes the Coughlin family, which also had NSW's first female statistician and the noted test cricketer [[Victor Trumper]]. The family was originally from [[County Offaly]], Ireland, until the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] invasion, then left [[County Cork]] in the 1850s just after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]. After attending [[Loreto Normanhurst]], Martin graduated from the [[University of Sydney]] in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, in which her major study was Music.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt;

==Pre-political career==
Having spent time in London and other overseas cities, she began working as a typist for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] in Sydney in 1978. In 1979, she became a trainee reporter.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; After several years, she began to take an interest in presenting, but was told that she would not be given a position in Sydney unless she had experience elsewhere {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. In February 1983,&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; Martin was then offered a six-month position {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} presenting a morning radio show in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Radio]] station [[105.7 ABC Darwin|5DR]].

She had little intention of staying there, and briefly returned to [[Canberra]] in May 1983,&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; before being offered a job in Sydney. However, at the same time, Martin's partner was offered a partner's position at the law firm he had worked in Darwin. He liked living in Darwin and was keen to take up the position, so Martin agreed to decline the Sydney job and return to Darwin in May 1985 where she gained another position on an ABC Radio morning show.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt;

In 1986, Martin made the move to television, as the presenter of ''[[The 7.30 Report]]'' until 1988. After returning from long service leave where she cared for her two young children,&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;[http://www.nt.alp.org.au/people/nt/martin_clare.php Clare Martin ALP biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907210939/http://www.nt.alp.org.au/people/nt/martin_clare.php |date=7 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin returned to work in 1990 to work on ABC Radio's morning program.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt;

==Political career==
Martin had been interested in political journalism for some years, although she was not a member of any party, believing that party affiliation compromises journalistic integrity.&lt;ref name=&quot;asn&quot; /&gt; In 1994, she was approached to contest the [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral division of Casuarina|Casuarina]] for the [[Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)|Labor Party]] at the [[1994 Northern Territory general election|1994 election]]. However, she was defeated by [[Country Liberal Party]] candidate [[Peter Adamson (Australian politician)|Peter Adamson]]. She soon resigned from the party and returned to journalism, but when former CLP Chief Minister [[Marshall Perron]] resigned from his Darwin seat of [[Electoral division of Fannie Bay|Fannie Bay]], Martin opted to contest the ensuing by-election as the Labor candidate.  Fannie Bay, like most Darwin electorates, had been a CLP stronghold; Perron held it with a majority of 8 percent.  However, in a considerable upset, Martin went on to win the seat by 69 votes, becoming one of only two ALP MLAs in Darwin.

Martin worked hard to retain her seat at the [[1997 Northern Territory general election|1997 election]], and was successful, holding Fannie Bay despite a heavy defeat for the ALP. She subsequently served as Shadow Minister for Lands under then leader [[Maggie Hickey]]. When Hickey unexpectedly resigned in February 1999, Martin was in a position to succeed her, and was soon elected party leader, and hence Opposition Leader. She soon emerged as a vocal critic of the [[Denis Burke (Australian politician)|Burke]] government's policy of [[mandatory sentencing]], and began preparing the ALP for the next election, which was then two years away.

==Term as Chief Minister==
Martin faced her first electoral test as leader at the [[2001 Northern Territory legislative election|2001]] election. At the time, the Country Liberal Party had held office for 27 years, and Labor had never come particularly close to government.  Indeed, it had never managed to win more than nine seats at any election. However, the ALP was coming off a particularly successful eighteen months, and Martin ran a skilled campaign. She was also able to take advantage of a number of gaffes made by then-Chief Minister [[Denis Burke (Australian politician)|Denis Burke]], such as the decision to preference [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] over the ALP â€“ which lost the CLP a number of votes in crucial Darwin seats.  The election also came during a bad time for the federal Coalition government, which was under fire for introducing a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] after previously vowing not to do so.

Despite this, most commentators were predicting the CLP would be returned for a ninth term in government, albeit with a reduced majority. However, in a shock result, Labor scored an eight-seat swing, achieving majority government by one seat.  It did so on the strength of an unexpected Labor wave in Darwin.  Labor had gone into the election holding only two seats in the capitalâ€”those of Martin and [[Paul Henderson (politician)|Paul Henderson]]â€”and had never held more than two seats in Darwin at any time.  In the 2001 election, however, Labor took all but one seat in Darwin, including all seven seats in the northern part of the city.  Darwin's northern suburbs are somewhat more diverse than the rest of the city.  In the process, they ousted four sitting MLAs; Labor had not unseated a CLP incumbent since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Green|Green, Antony]]. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/nt/2005/guide/summary.htm 2005 election summary]. [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 15 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the CLP won a bare majority of the two-party vote, Labor's gains in Darwin were enough to make Martin the first ALP and first female Chief Minister in the history of the Northern Territory.  Martin herself was reelected with a healthy swing of 9.2 percent in Fannie Bay, turning it into a safe Labor seat in one stroke.

As Chief Minister, Martin immediately set about making changes, repealing the territory's controversial mandatory sentencing laws,&lt;ref name=&quot;smh&quot;/&gt; and introducing [[freedom of information legislation]], which had been neglected during the CLP's 27-year rule. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Aboriginal issues===
Although Martin appointed [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] Territorians to her cabinet, she has been criticised for not improving the lot of her Aboriginal constituents, who on average have a life expectancy well below that of white Australians. A respected commentator in ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' suggested that she had gone slow on Aboriginal issues because she feared a white backlash that could have resulted in her government being toppled.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The life expectancy of the Northern Territory's Aboriginal citizens did not increase markedly during Martin's administration. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Alcohol abuse continued to be a major issue in Aboriginal communities and third-world diseases like [[trachoma]] could be seen in remote Aboriginal townships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/175_07_011001/taylor/taylor.html eMJA: Taylor, Trachoma in Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006, Martin rejected accusations by [[John Howard]] and Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister, [[Mal Brough]], that her government had been underfunding Aboriginal communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22008970-17001,00.html | title=Clare Martin denies underfunding Aboriginal communities â€“ NEWS.com.au }} {{Dead link|date=June 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A summit between the federal and territory governments was proposed by Mal Brough in May 2006, but this was snubbed by Martin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2006/s1642122.htm Lateline â€“ 18 May 2006: Martin snubs summit]&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was critical of the Federal Government's intervention in Aboriginal communities as announced in 2007. She opposed certain aspects of the intervention such as removal of the permit system. In response, the Federal Government rejected the Territory's argument, saying it was essential to remove artificial barriers to Aboriginal townships that prevent the measures needed to improve living conditions for Indigenous children&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s1973945.htm PM â€“ NT changes stance on Federal Indigenous plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Achievements===
In the longer term, she oversaw the completion of the [[the Ghan|Adelaide-Darwin railway]], which had begun under the [[Denis Burke (Australian politician)|Burke government]], and vowed to resurrect the stalled statehood movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/nt/content/2003/s862748.htm |title=Stateline Northern Territory |access-date=16 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521201247/http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/nt/content/2003/s862748.htm |archive-date=21 May 2006 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also managed to markedly boost the ALP's standing amongst the electorate, as seen in the [[2003 Katherine by-election]], which saw a major swing to the party.

By 2005, the Northern Territory, under Martin's leadership, had achieved the following:
* the highest economic growth in Australia at 7.2 per cent
* the lowest small business taxes
* record population growth
* the highest building approval rates
*surging house prices and record levels of home ownership.
* Property crime almost halved
* Approval for $1 billion development of Darwin wharf precinct&lt;ref name=&quot;smh&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/The-race-is-on/2005/06/16/1118869048130.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=The race is on | date=17 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chief Minister, Martin led the ALP to the [[2005 Northern Territory legislative election|2005 election]], which was their first as an incumbent government in the Territory. Martin campaigned largely on law and order issues. It was predicted that the ALP would win a relatively narrow victory.  However, in a result that had not been predicted by any commentators or even the most optimistic Labor observers, Martin led the ALP to a smashing victory.  The final result gave 19 seats to the ALP, 4 to the opposition CLP and 2 to independents. The ALP won six seats from the CLP, four of which they had never won before in any election.  Two of them were in [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], an area where Labor had never previously come close to winning.  In the most unexpected victory of all, the ALP even managed to unseat the [[Opposition Leader of the Northern Territory|Opposition Leader]] and former Chief Minister, Burke, in his own Palmerston-area electorate.  Labor won the second-largest majority government in the history of the Territory, bettered only by the CLP's near-sweep of the Legislative Assembly at the first elections, in 1974.

On 10 September 2007, [[Premier of Queensland|Queensland Premier]] [[Peter Beattie]] announced he would leave politics that week. This left Martin as Labor's longest-serving current state or territory leader, and as the longest-serving state or territory head of government in Australia, until she herself announced her resignation on 26 November 2007.

===Resignation===
On 26 November 2007, Clare Martin and her deputy [[Syd Stirling]] announced their resignations at a media conference in Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, Lindsay: [http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/clare-martin-and-deputy-quit/2007/11/26/1195975915525.html Clare Martin and deputy quit], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 26 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Education Minister [[Paul Henderson (politician)|Paul Henderson]] was elected as the new leader and Chief Minister by the ALP caucus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/26/2101345.htm Henderson confirmed as new NT Chief Minister], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 26 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

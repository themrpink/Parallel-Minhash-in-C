Gliders are mainly used for recreation, but have also been used for other purposes such as aerodynamics research, warfare and recovering spacecraft.

A [[motor glider]] does have an engine for extending its performance and some have engines powerful enough to take off, but the engine is not used in normal flight.

As is the case with planes, there are a wide variety of glider types differing in the construction of their wings, aerodynamic efficiency, location of the pilot and controls. Perhaps the most familiar type is the toy [[paper plane]].

Large gliders are most commonly launched by a tow-plane or by a winch. [[Military glider]]s have been used in war to deliver assault troops, and specialized gliders have been used in atmospheric and [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] research. [[Rocket-powered aircraft]] and [[spaceplane]]s have also made unpowered landings.

Gliders and sailplanes that are used for the sport of [[gliding]] have high aerodynamic efficiency. The highest [[lift-to-drag ratio]] is 70:1, though 50:1 is more common. After launch, further energy is obtained through the skillful exploitation of rising air in the atmosphere. Flights of thousands of kilometers at average speeds over 200&amp;nbsp;km/h have been achieved.

The most numerous unpowered aircraft are [[paper aeroplane|paper airplane]]s, a handmade type of glider. Like hang gliders and paragliders, they are foot-launched and are in general slower, smaller, and less expensive than sailplanes. Hang gliders most often have flexible wings given shape by a frame, though some have rigid wings. Paragliders and paper airplanes have no frames in their wings.

Gliders and sailplanes can share a number of features in common with powered aircraft, including many of the same types of fuselage and wing structures. For example, the [[Horten H.IV]] was a tailless flying wing glider, and the delta wing-shaped [[Space Shuttle]] orbiter flew much like a conventional glider in the lower atmosphere. Many gliders also use similar controls and instruments as powered craft.

====Types of glider====
[[File:Glider2010-overgunma.ogv|thumb|325px|(video) A glider sails over [[Gunma prefecture|Gunma]], [[Japan]]]] 
The main application today of glider aircraft is sport and recreation.

=====Sailplane=====
{{Main|Glider (sailplane)}}
Gliders were developed from the 1920s for recreational purposes. As pilots began to understand how to use rising air, [[sailplane]] gliders were developed with a high [[lift-to-drag ratio]]. These allowed longer glides to the next source of &quot;[[lift (soaring)|lift]]&quot;, and so increase their chances of flying long distances. This gave rise to the popular sport of [[gliding]].

Early gliders were mainly built of wood and metal but the majority of sailplanes now use composite materials incorporating glass, carbon or [[aramid]] fibers. To minimize [[drag (force)|drag]], these types have a streamlined [[fuselage]] and long narrow wings having a [[Wing configuration#Aspect ratio|high aspect ratio]]. Both single-seat and two-seat gliders are available.

Initially training was done by short &quot;hops&quot; in [[primary glider]]s which are very basic aircraft with no [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] and minimal instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweizer&quot;&gt;Schweizer, Paul A: ''Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States'', pages 14–22. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. {{ISBN|0-87474-828-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since shortly after [[World War II]] training has always been done in two-seat dual control gliders, but high performance two-seaters are also used to share the workload and the enjoyment of long flights. Originally skids were used for landing, but the majority now land on wheels, often retractable. Some gliders, known as [[motor glider]]s, are designed for unpowered flight, but can deploy [[piston engine|piston]], [[rotary engine|rotary]], [[jet engine|jet]] or [[electric motor|electric engines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;[http://www.fai.org/gliding/sc3.1.0 Definition of gliders used for sporting purposes in FAI Sporting Code] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903034839/http://www.fai.org/gliding/sc3.1.0 |date=3 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gliders are classified by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] for competitions into [[Glider Competition Classes|glider competition classes]] mainly on the basis of span and flaps.
[[Image:Goatglider.jpg|thumb|Ultralight &quot;airchair&quot; [[Sandlin Goat|Goat 1 glider]]]]
A class of ultralight sailplanes, including some known as [[microlift glider]]s and some known as &quot;airchairs&quot;, has been defined by the FAI based on a maximum weight. They are light enough to be transported easily, and can be flown without licensing in some countries. Ultralight gliders have performance similar to [[hang gliding|hang gliders]], but offer some additional crash safety as the pilot can be strapped in an upright seat within a deformable structure. Landing is usually on one or two wheels which distinguishes these craft from hang gliders. Several commercial ultralight gliders have come and gone, but most current development is done by individual designers and home builders.

=====Military gliders=====
[[Image:Waco CG-4A USAF.JPG|thumb|A 1943 [[USAAF]] [[Waco CG-4]]A]]
[[Military gliders]] were used during [[World War II]] for carrying troops ([[glider infantry]]) and heavy equipment to combat zones. The gliders were towed into the air and most of the way to their target by military transport planes, e.g. [[C-47 Dakota]], or by bombers that had been relegated to secondary activities, e.g. [[Short Stirling]]. Once released from the tow near the target, they landed as close to the target as possible. The advantage over paratroopers were that heavy equipment could be landed and that the troops were quickly assembled rather than being dispersed over a drop zone. The gliders were treated as disposable, leading to construction from common and inexpensive materials such as wood, though a few were retrieved and re-used. By the time of the [[Korean War]], transport aircraft had also become larger and more efficient so that even light tanks could be dropped by parachute, causing gliders to fall out of favor.

=====Research gliders=====
Even after the development of powered aircraft, gliders continued to be used for [[aviation research]]. The [[NASA Paresev|NASA Paresev Rogallo flexible wing]] was originally developed to investigate alternative methods of recovering spacecraft. Although this application was abandoned, publicity inspired hobbyists to adapt the flexible-wing airfoil for modern hang gliders.

Initial research into many types of fixed-wing craft, including [[flying wing]]s and [[lifting body|lifting bodies]] was also carried out using unpowered prototypes.

=====Hang glider=====
[[Image:Hang gliding hyner.jpg|thumb|Hang gliding]]
A [[hang glider]] is a [[glider aircraft]] in which the pilot is ensconced in a harness suspended from the [[airframe]], and exercises control by shifting body weight in opposition to a control frame. Most modern hang gliders are made of an [[aluminium alloy|aluminum alloy]] or [[Composite material|composite]]-framed fabric wing. Pilots have the ability to [[Lift (soaring)|soar]] for hours, gain thousands of meters of altitude in [[thermal]] updrafts, perform aerobatics, and glide cross-country for hundreds of kilometers.

=====Paraglider=====
A [[paraglider]] is a lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Whittall|first=Noel|title=Paragliding: The Complete Guide|year=2002|publisher=Airlife Pub|isbn=1-84037-016-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot sits in a [[Safety harness|harness]] suspended below a hollow fabric wing whose shape is formed by its suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside. Paragliding is most often a recreational activity.

====Unmanned gliders====
A [[paper airplane|paper plane]] is a toy aircraft (usually a glider) made out of paper or paperboard.

[[Model glider|Model glider aircraft]] are models of aircraft using lightweight materials such as [[polystyrene]] and [[balsa wood]]. Designs range from simple glider aircraft to accurate [[scale model]]s, some of which can be very large.

[[Glide bomb]]s are bombs with aerodynamic surfaces to allow a gliding flightpath rather than a ballistic one. This enables the carrying aircraft to attack a heavily defended target from a distance.

===Kite===
[[File:Chinese Kite.jpg|thumb|A [[kite]] in flight]]
{{main|Kite}}
A '''kite''' is an aircraft tethered to a fixed point so that the wind blows over its wings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/guided.htm '&amp;#39;Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics'&amp;#39;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325054529/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/guided.htm |date=25 March 2015 }}, [[NASA]] (11 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lift (force)|Lift]] is generated when air flows over the kite's wing, producing low pressure above the wing and high pressure below it, and deflecting the airflow downwards. This deflection also generates horizontal [[Drag (physics)|drag]] in the direction of the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of the one or more rope lines or [[tether]]s attached to the wing.

Kites are mostly flown for recreational purposes, but have many other uses. Early pioneers such as the [[Wright Brothers]] and [[J.W. Dunne]] sometimes flew an aircraft as a kite in order to develop it and confirm its flight characteristics, before adding an engine and flight controls, and flying it as an airplane.

====Uses====
[[Image:Chinese dragon kite (Berkeley, California - 2000).jpg|thumb|Chinese dragon kite more than one hundred feet long which flew in the [[Berkeley, California]], kite festival in 2000]]

=====Military applications=====
Kites have been used for signaling, for delivery of [[munition]]s, and for [[observation]], by lifting an observer above the field of battle, and by using [[kite aerial photography]].

=====Science and meteorology=====
Kites have been used for scientific purposes, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s famous experiment proving that [[lightning]] is [[electricity]]. Kites were the precursors to the traditional [[aircraft]], and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] experimented with very large [[man-lifting kite]]s, as did the [[Wright brothers]] and [[Lawrence Hargrave]]. Kites had a historical role in lifting scientific instruments to measure atmospheric conditions for [[weather forecasting]].

=====Radio aerials and light beacons=====
Kites can be used to carry radio antennas. This method was used for the reception station of the first transatlantic transmission by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]]. [[moored balloon|Captive balloons]] may be more convenient for such experiments, because kite-carried antennas require a lot of wind, which may be not always possible with heavy equipment and a ground conductor.

Kites can be used to carry light effects such as lightsticks or battery powered lights.

=====Kite traction=====
[[Image:Kite333.JPG|thumb|A quad-line traction kite, commonly used as a power source for [[kite surfing]]]]
Kites can be used to pull people and vehicles downwind. Efficient [[Foil kite|foil-type kites]] such as [[power kite]]s can also be used to sail upwind under the same principles as used by other sailing craft, provided that lateral forces on the ground or in the water are redirected as with the keels, center boards, wheels and ice blades of traditional sailing craft. In the last two decades, several kite sailing sports have become popular, such as kite buggying, kite landboarding, [[kiteboating|kite boating]] and kite surfing. Snow kiting has also become popular.

Kite sailing opens several possibilities not available in traditional sailing:

* Wind speeds are greater at higher altitudes
* Kites may be manoeuvered dynamically, which dramatically increases the available force
* There is no need for mechanical structures to withstand bending forces; vehicles or hulls can be very light or dispensed with altogether

=====Power generation=====
{{see also|Laddermill|High altitude wind power}}
Conceptual research and development projects are being undertaken by over a hundred participants to investigate the use of kites in harnessing high altitude wind currents for electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joseph Faust |url=http://energykitesystems.net/index.html |title=Kite Energy Systems |publisher=Energykitesystems.net |accessdate=3 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824215911/http://www.energykitesystems.net/index.html |archive-date=24 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airframe===
{{main|Airframe}}
The structural parts of a fixed-wing aircraft are called the airframe. The parts present can vary according to the aircraft's type and purpose. Early types were usually made of wood with fabric wing surfaces, When engines became available for a powered flight around a hundred years ago, their mounts were made of metal. Then as speeds increased more and more parts became metal until by the end of WWII all-metal aircraft were common. In modern times, increasing use of [[composite material]]s has been made.

Typical structural parts include:

* One or more large horizontal ''wings'', often with an [[airfoil]] cross-section shape. The wing deflects air downward as the aircraft moves forward, generating [[Lift (force)|lifting force]] to support it in flight. The wing also provides stability in [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|roll]] to stop the aircraft from rolling to the left or right in steady flight.
[[Image:Antonov 225 (2010).jpg|thumb|The [[An-225 Mriya]], the largest airplane in the world, which can carry a 250-tonne payload, has two vertical stabilizers]]
* A ''[[fuselage]]'', a long, thin body, usually with tapered or rounded ends to make its shape [[aerodynamically]] smooth. The fuselage joins the other parts of the airframe and usually contains important things such as the pilot, payload and flight systems.
* A ''[[vertical stabilizer]]'' or fin is a vertical wing-like surface mounted at the rear of the plane and typically protruding above it. The fin stabilizes the plane's [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|yaw]] (turn left or right) and mounts the [[rudder]] which controls its rotation along that axis.
* A ''[[horizontal stabilizer]]'', usually mounted at the tail near the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer is used to stabilize the plane's [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|pitch]] (tilt up or down) and mounts the [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] which provide pitch control.
* ''[[Landing gear]],'' a set of wheels, skids, or floats that support the plane while it is on the surface. On seaplanes, the bottom of the fuselage or floats (pontoons) support it while on the water. On some planes, the landing gear retracts during the flight to reduce drag.

===Wings===
The wings of a fixed-wing aircraft are static planes extending either side of the aircraft. When the aircraft travels forwards, 
air flows over the wings which are shaped to create lift.

====Wing structure====
Kites and some light weight gliders and airplanes have flexible wing surfaces which are stretched across a frame and made rigid by the lift forces exerted by the airflow over them. Larger aircraft have rigid wing surfaces which provide additional strength.

Whether flexible or rigid, most wings have a strong frame to give them their shape and to transfer lift from the wing surface to the rest of the aircraft. The main structural elements are one or more spars running from root to tip, and many ribs running from the leading (front) to the trailing (rear) edge.

Early airplane engines had little power and light weight was very important. Also, early aerofoil sections were very thin, and could not have strong frame installed within. So until the 1930s, most wings were too light weight to have enough strength and external bracing struts and wires were added. When the available engine power increased during the 1920s and 1930s, wings could be made heavy and strong enough that bracing was not needed anymore. This type of unbraced wing is called a cantilever wing.

====Wing configuration====
{{main|Wing configuration|Wing}}
[[File:Morane-Saulnier Type L - Captured with german insigna.jpg|thumb|Captured [[Morane-Saulnier L]] wire-braced parasol monoplane]]
The number and shape of the wings vary widely on different types. A given wing plane may be full-span or divided by a central [[fuselage]] into port (left) and starboard (right) wings. Occasionally, even more, wings have been used, with the three-winged [[triplane]] achieving some fame in WWI. The four-winged [[quadruplane]] and other [[Multiplane (Aeronautics)]] designs have had little success.

A [[monoplane]], which derives from the prefix, mono means one which means it has a single wing plane, a [[biplane]] has two stacked one above the other, a [[tandem wing]] has two placed one behind the other. When the available engine power increased during the 1920s and 1930s and bracing was no longer needed, the unbraced or cantilever monoplane became the most common form of powered type.

The wing [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]] is the shape when seen from above. To be aerodynamically efficient, a wing should be straight with a long span from side to side but have a short chord (high [[aspect ratio]]). But to be structurally efficient, and hence lightweight, a wing must have a short span but still enough area to provide lift (low aspect ratio).

At transonic speeds, near the [[speed of sound]], it helps to sweep the wing backward or forwards to reduce drag from supersonic shock waves as they begin to form. The [[swept wing]] is just a straight wing swept backward or forwards.

[[Image:Dassault Mirage G8.jpg|thumb|Two [[Dassault Mirage G]] prototypes, one with wings swept (top)]]

The [[delta wing]] is a triangle shape which may be used for a number of reasons. As a flexible [[Rogallo wing]] it allows a stable shape under aerodynamic forces, and so is often used for kites and other ultralight craft. As a supersonic wing, it combines high strength with low drag and so is often used for fast jets.

A variable geometry wing can be changed in flight to a different shape. The [[variable sweep wing|variable-sweep wing]] transforms between an efficient straight configuration for [[takeoff and landing]], to a low-drag swept configuration for high-speed flight. Other forms of variable planform have been flown, but none have gone beyond the research stage.

===Fuselage===
{{Main|fuselage}}
A ''[[fuselage]]'' is a long, thin body, usually with tapered or rounded ends to make its shape [[aerodynamically]] smooth. The fuselage may contain the [[flight crew]], passengers, cargo or [[payload (air and space craft)|payload]], fuel and engines. The pilots of manned aircraft operate them from a ''[[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]]'' located at the front or top of the fuselage and equipped with controls and usually windows and instruments. A plane may have more than one fuselage, or it may be fitted with booms with the tail located between the booms to allow the extreme rear of the fuselage to be useful for a variety of purposes.

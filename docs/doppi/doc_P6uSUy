{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Dayananda Saraswati''' ({{audio|Dayananda Saraswati.ogg|pronunciation}}) (12 February 1824 – 30 October 1883) was an Indian philosopher, social leader and founder of the [[Arya Samaj]], a [[reform movement]] of the [[Vedic Period|Vedic]] [[dharma]]. He was the first to give the call for ''[[Swaraj]]'' as &quot;India for Indians&quot; in 1876, a call later taken up by [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Lokmanya Tilak]].&lt;ref&gt;Aurobindo Ghosh, ''Bankim Tilak Dayanand'' (Calcutta 1947 p1)&quot;Lokmanya Tilak also said that Swami Dayanand was the first who proclaimed Swaraj for Bharatpita i.e.India.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dayanand Saraswati ''Commentary on Yajurved'' (Lazarus Press Banaras 1876)&lt;/ref&gt; Denouncing the [[idolatry]] and ritualistic worship prevalent in [[British Raj|India]] at the time, he worked towards reviving [[Vedic]] ideologies. Subsequently, the [[philosopher]] and [[President of India]], [[S. Radhakrishnan]] called him one of the &quot;makers of Modern India&quot;, as did [[Sri Aurobindo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Living with a Purpose|year=2005 |first= S. |last = Radhakrishnan|publisher=Orient Paperbacks|isbn=978-81-222-0031-7 |page=  34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_DrAZbdlTAC&amp;pg=PA34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essays on modern Indian Abuse |last= Kumar|first=Raj |authorlink= |year=2003|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7141-690-5|page=  62|chapter =5.

He was a [[sanyasi]] (ascetic) from boyhood and a scholar. He believed in the [[infallible]] [[Moral absolutism|authority]] of the [[Vedas]]. Dayananda advocated the doctrine of [[Karma]] and [[Reincarnation]]. He emphasized the Vedic ideals of [[brahmacharya]], including [[celibacy]] and [[Bhakti|devotion to God]].

Among Dayananda's contributions were his promoting of the [[equal rights for women]], such as the right to education and reading of [[Hindu scriptures|Indian scriptures]], and his commentary on the [[Vedas]] from [[Vedic Sanskrit]] in [[Sanskrit]] as well as in [[Hindi]].

== Early life ==

Dayananda Saraswati was born on the 10th day of waning moon in the month of Purnimanta Falguna (12 February 1824) on the [[tithi]] to a [[Brahmin]] [[Hinduism|Hindu]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Rinehart|title=Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMPYnfS_R90C&amp;pg=PA58|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-905-8|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Jeevapar [[Tankara]], [[Kathiawad]] region (now [[Morbi district]] of Gujarat.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/devdutt-pattanaik-dayanand--vivekanand/17911158|title=Devdutt Pattanaik: Dayanand &amp; Vivekanand|date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gu.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%AA%AA%E0%AB%83%E0%AA%B7%E0%AB%8D%E0%AA%A0:Jhanda_Dhari_Maharshi_Dayanand.pdf/%E0%AB%A7%E0%AB%AC ઝંડાધારી – મહર્ષિ દયાનંદ – Gujarati Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt; His original name was Mul Shankar because he was born in Dhanu Rashi and Mul Nakshatra. His father was Karshanji Lalji Kapadi, and his mother was Yashodabai.

When he was eight years old, his [[Upanayana|Yajnopavita Sanskara]] ceremony was performed, marking his entry into formal education. His father was a follower of [[Shiva]] and taught him the ways to impress Shiva. He was also taught the importance of keeping fasts. On the occasion of [[Shivratri]], Dayananda sat awake the whole night in obedience to Shiva. During one of these fasts, he saw a mouse eating the offerings and running over the idol's body. After seeing this, he questioned that if Shiva could not defend himself against a mouse, then how could he be the saviour of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indiansaga.com/history/congress_arya.html|title=History of India|website=indiansaga.com|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of his younger sister and his uncle from [[cholera]] led Dayananda to ponder the meaning of life and death. He began asking questions which worried his parents. He was engaged in his early teens, but he decided marriage was not for him and ran away from home in 1846.&lt;ref name=&quot;iloveindia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloveindia.com/spirituality/gurus/dayanand-saraswati.html|title=Dayanand Saraswati|author=|date=|work=iloveindia.com|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;culturalindia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalindia.net/reformers/swami-dayanand-saraswati.html|title=Swami Dayanand Saraswati|author=|date=|work=culturalindia.net|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dayananda Saraswati spent nearly twenty-five years, from 1845 to 1869, as a wandering [[ascetic]], searching for religious truth. He gave up material goods and lived a life of self-denial, devoting himself to spiritual pursuits in forests, retreats in the [[Himalaya]]n Mountains, and pilgrimage sites in northern India. During these years he practised various forms of [[yoga]] and became a disciple of a religious teacher named [[Virajanand Dandeesha]]. Virajanand believed that Hinduism had strayed from its historical roots and that many of its practices had become impure. Dayananda Sarasvati promised Virajanand that he would devote his life to restoring the rightful place of the [[Vedas]] in the Hindu faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarasvati, Dayananda – World Religions Reference Library|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3448400050.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610083329/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3448400050.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 June 2014|publisher= World Religions Reference Library {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dayanand's mission ==

[[File:O3m AryaSamaj.PNG|right|thumb|[[Om|Aum]] or Om is considered by the [[Arya Samaj]] to be the highest and most proper name of God.]] He believed that Hinduism had been corrupted by divergence from the founding principles of the Vedas and that Hindus had been misled by the priesthood for the priests' self-aggrandizement. For this mission, he founded the [[Arya Samaj]], enunciating the [[Ten Universal Principles]] as a code for Universalism, called ''Krinvanto Vishwaryam''. With these principles, he intended the whole world to be an abode for Nobles (Aryas).

His next step was to reform Hinduism with a new dedication to God. He travelled the country challenging religious scholars and priests to discussions, winning repeatedly through the strength of his arguments and knowledge of Sanskrit and Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/people/04018.htm|title=Swami Dayananda Sarasvati by V. Sundaram|author=|date=|work=Boloji|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu priests discouraged the [[laity]] from reading [[Vedic]] scriptures, and encouraged rituals, such as bathing in the [[Ganges River]] and feeding of priests on anniversaries, which Dayananda pronounced as [[superstitions]] or self-serving practices. By exhorting the nation to reject such superstitious notions, his aim was to educate the nation to return to the teachings of the Vedas, and to follow the Vedic way of life. He also exhorted the Hindu nation to accept social reforms, including the importance of Cows for national prosperity as well as the adoption of [[Hindi]] as the national language for national integration. Through his daily life and practice of yoga and asanas, teachings, preaching, sermons and writings, he inspired the Hindu nation to aspire to ''Swarajya'' (self governance), nationalism, and spiritualism. He advocated the equal rights and respects to women and advocated for the education of all children, regardless of gender.

Dayanand also made critical analyses of faiths including [[Christianity]] &amp; [[Islam]], as well as of other Indian faiths like [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Sikhism]]. In addition to discouraging [[idolatry]] in Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3440/books.html |title=Light of Truth |accessdate=9 October 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028134700/http://geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3440/books.html |archivedate=28 October 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also against what he considered to be the corruption of the true and pure faith in his own country. Unlike many other reform movements of his times within Hinduism, the Arya Samaj's appeal was addressed not only to the educated few in India, but to the world as a whole as evidenced in the sixth principle of the Arya Samaj. As a result, his teachings professed universalism for all the living beings and not for any particular sect, faith, community or nation.

Arya Samaj allows and encourages converts to Hinduism. Dayananda's concept of [[dharma]] is stated in the &quot;Beliefs and Disbeliefs&quot; section of ''Satyartha Prakash,'' he says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{Quotation|&quot;I accept as Dharma whatever is in full conformity with impartial justice, truthfulness and the like; that which is not opposed to the teachings of God as embodied in the [[Vedas]]. Whatever is not free from partiality and is unjust, partaking of untruth and the like, and opposed to the teachings of God as embodied in the Vedas—that I hold as [[adharma]].&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;He, who after careful thinking, is ever ready to accept truth and reject falsehood; who counts the happiness of others as he does that of his own self, him I call just.&quot;|''[[Satyarth Prakash]]''}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dayananda's Vedic message emphasized respect and reverence for other human beings, supported by the Vedic notion of the divine nature of the individual. In the [[Arya Samaj#Principles|ten principles of the Arya Samaj]], he enshrined the idea that &quot;All actions should be performed with the prime objective of benefiting mankind&quot;, as opposed to following dogmatic rituals or revering idols and symbols. The first five principles speak of Truth, while the last five speak of a society with nobility, civics, co-living, and disciplined life. In his own life, he interpreted [[moksha]] to be a lower calling, as it argued for benefits to the individual, rather than calling to emancipate others.

Dayananda's &quot;back to the Vedas&quot; message influenced many thinkers and philosophers the world over.&lt;ref name=Panicker&gt;{{cite book|author=P. L. John Panicker|title=Gandhi on Pluralism and Communalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4s2kBMLeXoEC|year=2006|publisher=ISPCK|isbn=978-81-7214-905-5|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities===

Dayanand Saraswati is recorded to have been active since he was 14, which time he was able to recite religious verses and teach about them. He was respected at the time for taking part in religious debates. His debates were attended by large crowds.

On 22 October 1869 in [[Varanasi]], where he won a debate against 27 scholars and 12 expert pandits. The debate was said to have been attended by over 50,000 people. The main topic was &quot;Do the Vedas uphold deity worship?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The World p. 123&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Clifford Sawhney|title=The World's Greatest Seers and Philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUvLhVrizAoC|date= 2003|publisher=Pustak Mahal|isbn=978-81-223-0824-2|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sinhal|Sinhal]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; he was also a socio religious reformer lived in 19 th century.

== Arya Samaj ==
{{Main|Arya Samaj}}

Dayananda Saraswati's creations, the [[Arya Samaj]], condemned practices of several different religions and communities, including such practices as [[idol worship]], [[animal sacrifice]], [[pilgrimages]], priest craft, offerings made in temples, the [[caste system|castes]], [[child marriages]], [[Meat|meat eating]] and discrimination against women. He argued that all of these practices ran contrary to good sense and the wisdom of the [[Vedas]].

== Views on superstitions ==

He severely criticized practices which he considered to be superstitions, including sorcery, and astrology, which were prevalent in India at the time. Below are several quotes from his book, Sathyarth Prakash:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{Quotation|&quot;They should also counsel then against all things that lead to superstition, and are opposed to true religion and science, so that they may never give credence to such imaginary things as ghosts (Bhuts) and spirits (Preta).&quot;|''[[Satyarth Prakash]]''}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Quotation|&quot;All alchemists, magicians, sorcerers, wizards, spiritists, etc. are cheats and all their practices should be looked upon as nothing but downright fraud. Young people should be well counseled against all these frauds, in their very childhood, so that they may not suffer through being duped by any unprincipled person.&quot;|''[[Satyarth Prakash]]''
}}

On Astrology, he wrote,

{{Quotation|when these ignorant people go to an astrologer and say &quot; O Sir! What is wrong with this person'? He replies &quot;The sun and other stars are maleficent to him. If you were to perform a propitiatory ceremony or have magic formulas chanted, or prayers said, or specific acts of charity done, he will recover. Otherwise, I should not be surprised, even if he were to lose his life after a long period of suffering.&quot;

Inquirer – Well, Mr. Astrologer, you know, the sun and other stars are but inanimate things like this earth of ours. They can do nothing but give light, heat, etc. Do you take them for conscious being possessed of human passions, of pleasure and anger, that when offended, bring on pain and misery, and when propitiated, bestow happiness on human beings?

Astrologer – Is it not through the influence of stars, then, that some people are rich and others poor, some are rulers, whilst others are their subjects?

Inq. – No, it is all the result of their deeds….good or bad.

Ast. – Is the Science of stars untrue then?

Inq. – No, that part of it which comprises Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, etc., and which goes by the name of Astronomy is true; but the other part that treats of the influence of stars on human beings and their actions and goes by the name of Astrology is all false.|Chapter 2.2 ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'' }}

He makes a clear distinction between Jyotisha Shaastra and astrology, calling astrology a fraud.

{{Quotation|&quot;Thereafter, they should thoroughly study the Jyotisha Shaastra – which includes Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Geography, Geology, and Astronomy in two years. They should also have practical training in these Sciences, learn the proper handling of instruments, master their mechanism, and know how to use them. But they should regard Astrology – which treats of the influence of stars and constellation on the destinies of man, of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of time, of horoscopes, etc. – as a fraud, and never learn or teach any books on this subject. |Under &quot;The scheme of studies&quot; Page 73 of the English Version of ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]''

== Views on other religions ==

===Islam===
{{see also|Criticism of Islam}}

He viewed [[Islam]] to be waging wars and immorality. He doubted that Islam had anything to do with the God, and questioned why a God would hate every non-believer, allowing the slaughter of animals, and command [[Muhammad]] to slaughter innocent people.&lt;ref&gt;Title = &quot;Journal of Indian Council of Philosophical Research, Volume 19, Issue 1&quot;, publisher = ICPR, year = 2002, page = 73&lt;/ref&gt;

He further described Muhammad as &quot;imposter&quot;, and one who held out &quot;a bait to men and women, in the name of God, to compass his own selfish needs&quot;. He regarded Quran as &quot;Not the Word of God. It is a human work. Hence it cannot be believed in&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Satyarth Prakash (The Light of Truth)|year=1875|last=Saraswati|first=Dayanand|chapter=An Examination Of The Doctrine Of Islam|pages=672–683|publisher=Star Press|location=Varanasi, India|chapter-url=http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/chapterfourteen.htm|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{see also|Criticism of Christianity | Criticism of Jesus#Dayanand Saraswati}}

His analysis of the [[Bible]] was based on an attempt to compare it with scientific evidence, morality, and other properties. His analysis claimed that the Bible contains many stories and precepts that are immoral, praising cruelty, deceit and that encourage sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. T. F. Jordens|title=Dayānanda Sarasvatī, his life and ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ysKAQAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; One commentary notes many alleged discrepancies and fallacies of logic in the Bible e.g. that God fearing Adam eating the fruit of life and becoming his equal displays jealousy. His critique attempts to show logical fallacies in the Bible, and throughout he asserts that the events depicted in the Bible portray God as a man rather than an Omniscient, Omnipotent or Complete being.

He opposed the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]], he added that such doctrines are simply against the nature of law, and that God would never break his own law because God is omniscient and infallible.

===Sikhism===
{{see also|Criticism of Sikhism}}

He regarded [[Guru Nanak]] as &quot;rogue&quot;, who was quite ignorant about Vedas, Sanskrit, Shashtra, and otherwise Nanak wouldn't be mistaking with words. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.4135/9788132108412.n19|title=Reduced to Ashes |title-link=Reduced to Ashes (book)|volume=Vol. 1|page= 15|isbn=	978-99933-53-57-7|chapter=Reduced to Ashes: The Insurgency and Human Rights in Punjab |year=2009 |last1=Kumar |first1=Ram Narayan }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He further pointed that followers of Sikhism are to be blamed for making up stories that Nanak possessed miraculous powers, met Gods. He slammed Guru Gobind Singh, and other Gurus to have been &quot;invented fictitious stories&quot;, although he also recognized Gobind Singh to be &quot;indeed a very brave man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=V.

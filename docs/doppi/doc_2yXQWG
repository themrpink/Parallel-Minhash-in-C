&lt;!-- The following headings of Computer networking equipment are now possibly partially depreciated in this article, having been copied from [[Computer network]]. While these are indeed computer network building blocks, most provide services above the Physical Layer. Some headings can be modified to be inclusive of non-internet or non-Ethernet technologies specifically to address how they are relevant to  (e.g., repeaters have long use in serial protocols, USB depends on Hubs). --&gt;
===Network interfaces===
[[File:ForeRunnerLE 25 ATM Network Interface (1).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A network interface circuit with port for ATM|An [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] network interface in the form of an accessory card. A lot of network interfaces are built-in.]]
A [[network interface controller]] (NIC) is [[computer hardware]] that provides a computer with the ability to access the transmission media, and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.

The NIC responds to traffic addressed to a [[network address]] for either the NIC or the computer as a whole.

In [[Ethernet]] networks, each network interface controller has a unique [[MAC address|Media Access Control]] (MAC) address—usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six [[Octet (computing)|octets]]. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.

===Repeaters and hubs===
A [[repeater]] is an [[Electronics|electronic]] device that receives a network [[signal (information theory)|signal]], cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it.  The signal may be reformed or [[retransmission (data networks)|retransmitted]] at a higher power level, to the other side of an obstruction possibly using a different transmission medium&lt;!-- technically bridge-to-bridge --&gt;, so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. Commercial repeaters have extended [[RS-232]] segments from 15 meters to over a kilometer.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Converters, [http://www.usconverters.com/rs232-repeater-extender RS232 Repeater]&lt;/ref&gt; In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.

Repeaters work within the physical layer of the OSI model, that is, there is no end-to-end change in the physical protocol across the repeater, or repeater pair, even if a different physical layer may be used between the ends of the repeater, or repeater pair. Repeaters require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a [[propagation delay]] that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters that can be used in a row, e.g., the Ethernet [[5-4-3 rule]].

A repeater with multiple ports is known as hub, an [[Ethernet hub]] in Ethernet networks, a [[USB hub]] in USB networks.
* [[USB]] networks use hubs to form tiered-star topologies.
* Ethernet hubs and repeaters in LANs have been mostly obsoleted by modern [[network switch|switches]].

===Bridges===
A [[network bridge]] connects and filters traffic between two [[network segment]]s at the [[data link layer]] (layer 2) of the [[OSI model]] to form a single network. This breaks the network's collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.

Bridges come in three basic types:
*Local bridges: Directly connect LANs
*Remote bridges: Can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs. Remote bridges, where the connecting link is slower than the end networks, largely have been replaced with routers.
*Wireless bridges: Can be used to join LANs or connect remote devices to LANs.

===Switches===
A [[network switch]] is a device that forwards and filters [[OSI layer 2]] [[datagram]]s ([[Frame (networking)|frames]]) between [[Computer port (hardware)|ports]] based on the destination MAC address in each frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/s/switch.html
|title=Define switch.
|publisher=WWW.Wikipedia.com
|accessdate=April 8, 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected. It can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm|title=What bridge devices and bridging do for computer networks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It learns to associate physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and cascading additional switches.

[[Network switch#Layer-specific functionality|Multi-layer switches]] are capable of routing based on layer 3 addressing or additional logical levels. The term ''switch'' is often used loosely to include devices such as routers and bridges, as well as devices that may distribute traffic based on load or based on application content (e.g., a Web [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] identifier).

===Routers===
[[File:Adsl connections.jpg|thumb|right|A typical home or small office router showing the [[ADSL]] telephone line and [[Ethernet]] network cable connections]]
A [[Router (computing)|router]] is an [[internetworking]] device that forwards [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram (Internet protocol information from layer 3).  The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table (or forwarding table).  A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets. A destination in a routing table can include a &quot;null&quot; interface, also known as the &quot;black hole&quot; interface because data can go into it, however, no further processing is done for said data, i.e. the packets are dropped.

===Modems===
[[Modem]]s (MOdulator-DEModulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more [[carrier signal]]s are [[modulation|modulated]] by the digital signal to produce an [[analog signal]] that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Modems are commonly used for telephone lines, using a [[digital subscriber line]] technology.

===Firewalls===
A [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] is a network device for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in [[cyberattack|cyber attack]]s.

==Classification==
The study of network topology recognizes eight basic topologies: point-to-point, bus, star, ring or circular, mesh, tree, hybrid, or daisy chain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bicsi, B. 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Bicsi, B. |date=2002 |title=Network Design Basics for Cabling Professionals |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |isbn=9780071782968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Point-to-point===
{{main article|Point-to-point (telecommunications)}}
The simplest topology with a dedicated link between two endpoints. Easiest to understand, of the variations of point-to-point topology, is a point-to-point [[communication channel]] that appears, to the user, to be permanently associated with the two endpoints. A child's [[tin can telephone]] is one example of a ''physical dedicated'' channel.

Using [[circuit-switching]] or [[packet-switching]] technologies, a point-to-point circuit can be set up dynamically and dropped when no longer needed. Switched point-to-point topologies are the basic model of conventional [[telephony]].

The value of a permanent point-to-point network is unimpeded communications between the two endpoints. The value of an on-demand point-to-point connection is proportional to the number of potential pairs of subscribers and has been expressed as [[Metcalfe's Law]].

===Daisy chain===
[[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|Daisy chaining]] is accomplished by connecting each computer in series to the next.  If a message is intended for a computer partway down the line, each system bounces it along in sequence until it reaches the destination.  A daisy-chained network can take two basic forms: linear and ring.

* A '''[[Linear bus topology|linear topology]]''' puts a two-way link between one computer and the next.  However, this was expensive in the early days of computing, since each computer (except for the ones at each end) required two receivers and two transmitters.
* By connecting the computers at each end of the chain, a '''[[ring topology]]''' can be formed. When a [[Node (networking)|node]] sends a message, the message is processed by each computer in the ring.  An advantage of the ring is that the number of transmitters and receivers can be cut in half. Since a message will eventually loop all of the way around, transmission does not need to go both directions.  Alternatively, the ring can be used to improve fault tolerance. If the ring breaks at a particular link then the transmission can be sent via the reverse path thereby ensuring that all nodes are always connected in the case of a single failure.

===Bus===
[[File:BusNetwork.svg|thumb|Bus network topology]]
{{Main article|Bus network}}
In local area networks using bus topology, each node is connected by interface connectors to a single central cable. This is the 'bus', also referred to as the [[Backbone network|backbone]], or [[Trunk (telecommunications)|trunk]])&amp;nbsp;– all [[data transmission]] between nodes in the network is transmitted over this common transmission medium and is able to be [[Receiver (Information Theory)|received]] by all nodes in the network simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groth&quot;/&gt;

A signal containing the address of the intended receiving machine travels from a source machine in both directions to all machines connected to the bus until it finds the intended recipient, which then accepts the data. If the machine address does not match the intended address for the data, the data portion of the signal is ignored. Since the bus topology consists of only one wire it is less expensive to implement than other topologies, but the savings are offset by the higher cost of managing the network. Additionally, since the network is dependent on the single cable, it can be the [[single point of failure]] of the network. In this topology data being transferred may be accessed by any node.

====Linear bus====
In a linear bus network, all of the nodes of the network are connected to a common transmission medium which has just two endpoints. When the electrical signal reaches the end of the bus, the signal is reflected back down the line, causing unwanted interference.  To prevent this, the two endpoints of the bus are normally terminated with a device called a [[Electrical termination|terminator]].

====Distributed bus====
In a distributed bus network, all of the nodes of the network are connected to a common transmission medium with more than two endpoints, created by adding branches to the main section of the transmission medium&amp;nbsp;– the physical distributed bus topology functions in exactly the same fashion as the physical linear bus topology because all nodes share a common transmission medium.

===Star===
{{Main article|Star network}}
[[File:StarNetwork.svg|thumb|Star network topology]]
In star topology, every peripheral node (computer workstation or any other peripheral) is connected to a central node called a hub or switch. The hub is the server and the peripherals are the clients. The network does not necessarily have to resemble a star to be classified as a star network, but all of the peripheral nodes on the network must be connected to one central hub. All traffic that traverses the network passes through the central hub, which acts as a [[Repeater|signal repeater]]. 

The star topology is considered the easiest topology to design and implement.  One advantage of the star topology is the simplicity of adding additional nodes. The primary disadvantage of the star topology is that the hub represents a single point of failure. Also, since all peripheral communication must flow through the central hub, the aggregate central bandwidth forms a network bottleneck for large clusters.

====Extended star====
The extended star network topology extends a physical star topology by one or more repeaters between the central node and the [[peripheral]] (or 'spoke') nodes. The repeaters are used to extend the maximum transmission distance of the physical layer, the point-to-point distance between the central node and the peripheral nodes. Repeaters allow greater transmission distance, further than would be possible using just the transmitting power of the central node. The use of repeaters can also overcome limitations from the standard upon which the physical layer is based.

A physical extended star topology in which repeaters are replaced with hubs or switches is a type of hybrid network topology and is referred to as a physical hierarchical star topology, although some texts make no distinction between the two topologies.

A physical hierarchical star topology can also be referred as a tier-star topology, this topology differs from a [[tree topology]] in the way star networks are connected together. A tier-star topology uses a central node, while a tree topology uses a central bus and can also be referred as a star-bus network.

====Distributed star====
A distributed star is a network topology that is composed of individual networks that are based upon the physical star topology connected in a linear fashion&amp;nbsp;– i.e., 'daisy-chained'&amp;nbsp;– with no central or top level connection point (e.g., two or more 'stacked' hubs, along with their associated star connected nodes or 'spokes').

===Ring===
{{Main article|Ring network}}
[[File:RingNetwork.svg|thumb|Ring network topology]]

A ring topology is a [[Bus network|bus topology]] in a closed loop. Data travels around the ring in one direction. When one node sends data to another, the data passes through each intermediate node on the ring until it reaches its destination. The intermediate nodes repeat (re transmit) the data to keep the signal strong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inc, S. 2002&quot;/&gt; Every node is a peer; there is no hierarchical relationship of clients and servers. If one node is unable to re transmit data, it severs communication between the nodes before and after it in the bus.

Advantages:
* When the load on the network increases, its performance is better than bus topology.
* There is no need of network server to control the connectivity between workstations.

Disadvantages:
* Aggregate network bandwidth is bottlenecked by the weakest link between two nodes.

===Mesh===
{{Main article|Mesh networking}}
The value of fully meshed networks is proportional to the exponent of the number of subscribers, assuming that communicating groups of any two endpoints, up to and including all the endpoints, is approximated by [[Reed's Law]].

====Fully connected network====
[[File:NetworkTopology-FullyConnected.png|thumb|Fully connected mesh topology]]

In a ''fully connected network'', all nodes are interconnected. (In [[graph theory]] this is called a [[complete graph]].) The simplest fully connected network is a two-node network. A fully connected network doesn't need to use [[packet switching]] or [[Broadcasting (networks)|broadcasting]]. However, since the number of connections grows quadratically with the number of nodes:

&lt;math&gt;c= \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This makes it impractical for large networks.  This kind of topology does not trip and affect other nodes in the network.

====Partially connected network====
[[File:NetworkTopology-Mesh.svg|thumb|Partially connected mesh topology]]
In a partially connected network, certain nodes are connected to exactly one other node; but some nodes are connected to two or more other nodes with a point-to-point link. This makes it possible to make use of some of the redundancy of mesh topology that is physically fully connected, without the expense and complexity required for a connection between every node in the network.

===Hybrid===
Hybrid topology is also known as hybrid network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orosk.com/hybrid-topology/|title=What is Hybrid Topology ? Advantages and Disadvantages|website=OROSK.COM|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hybrid networks combine two or more topologies in such a way that the resulting network does not exhibit one of the standard topologies (e.g., bus, star, ring, etc.). For example, a [[tree network]] (or ''star-bus network'') is a hybrid topology in which [[star network]]s are interconnected via [[bus network]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sosinsky&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Networking Bible |last=Sosinsky |first=Barrie A. |page=16 |date=2009 |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Wiley Publishing |isbn=978-0-470-43131-3 |oclc=359673774 |chapter=Network Basics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3DOREqRZejcC&amp;pg=PA16 |access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gnuwPpBcO-MC&amp;pg=RA1-PT12 |title=Understanding Computer Science (for Advanced Level): The Study Guide |last=Bradley |first=Ray |location=Cheltenham |publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]] |page=244 |isbn=978-0-7487-6147-0 |oclc=47869750 |access-date=2016-03-26|year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a tree network connected to another tree network is still topologically a tree network, not a distinct network type. A hybrid topology is always produced when two different basic network topologies are connected.

A ''star-ring'' network consists of two or more ring networks connected using a [[Media Access Unit|multistation access unit]] (MAU) as a centralized hub.

Snowflake topology is a star network of star networks.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Two other hybrid network types are ''hybrid mesh'' and ''hierarchical star''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sosinsky&quot;/&gt;

==Centralization==
The '''[[Star network|star topology]]''' reduces the probability of a network failure by connecting all of the peripheral nodes (computers, etc.) to a central node.  When the physical star topology is applied to a logical bus network such as [[Ethernet]], this central node (traditionally a hub) rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node to all peripheral nodes on the network, sometimes including the originating node. All [[peripheral]] nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to, and receiving from, the central node only.  The [[failure]] of a [[transmission line]] linking any peripheral node to the central node will result in the isolation of that peripheral node from all others, but the remaining peripheral nodes will be unaffected. However, the disadvantage is that the failure of the central node will cause the failure of all of the peripheral nodes.

If the central node is ''passive'', the originating node must be able to tolerate the reception of an [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] of its own transmission, delayed by the two-way [[round-trip time|round trip]] [[transmission time]]  (i.e. to and from the central node) plus any delay generated in the central node. An ''active'' star network has an active central node that usually has the means to prevent echo-related problems.

A '''[[tree topology]]''' (a.k.a. '''hierarchical topology''') can be viewed as a collection of star networks arranged in a [[hierarchy]].  This [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] has individual peripheral nodes (e.g. leaves) which are required to transmit to and receive from one other node only and are not required to act as repeaters or regenerators.  Unlike the star network, the functionality of the central node may be distributed.

As in the conventional star network, individual nodes may thus still be isolated from the network by a single-point failure of a transmission path to the node. If a link connecting a leaf fails, that leaf is isolated; if a connection to a non-leaf node fails, an entire section of the network becomes isolated from the rest.

To alleviate the amount of network traffic that comes from broadcasting all signals to all nodes, more advanced central nodes were developed that are able to keep track of the identities of the nodes that are connected to the network.  These [[network switch]]es will &quot;learn&quot; the layout of the network by &quot;listening&quot; on each port during normal data transmission, examining the [[data packets]] and recording the address/identifier of each connected node and which port it is connected to in a [[lookup table]] held in memory. This lookup table then allows future transmissions to be forwarded to the intended destination only.

==Decentralization==
In a partially connected mesh topology, there are at least two nodes with two or more paths between them to provide redundant paths in case the link providing one of the paths fails. Decentralization is often used to compensate for the single-point-failure disadvantage that is present when using a single device as a central node (e.g., in star and tree networks). A special kind of mesh, limiting the number of hops between two nodes, is a [[hypercube]]. The number of arbitrary forks in mesh networks makes them more difficult to design and implement, but their decentralized nature makes them very useful.

This is similar in some ways to a [[grid network]], where a linear or ring topology is used to connect systems in multiple directions.  A multidimensional ring has a [[torus|toroidal]] topology, for instance.

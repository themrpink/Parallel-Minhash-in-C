== 1290 to c.1500 ==
The poets of this period are known as Beirdd yr Uchelwyr. The list is fairly chronological but not exhaustive as the work of some minor poets of the late 15th and 16th centuries remains in manuscript and a large corpus of late medieval [[Darogan]], prophetic verse, is anonymous or attributed to early poets. Traditional patronage dwindled in the late 16th century but a handful of bards still received patronage from the gentry into the 17th century. Free verse by individuals composing &quot;freelance&quot; gradually took over from the mid-16th century onwards.

'''Llywelyn the Great''' ({{lang-cy|Llywelyn Fawr}}, {{IPA-cy|ɬəˈwɛlɪn vaʊ̯r|}}), full name '''Llywelyn ap Iorwerth''', (c. 1173{{spaced ndash}}11 April 1240) was a King of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] in north [[Wales]] and eventually ruler of all Wales. By a combination of war and diplomacy he dominated Wales for 45 years.

During Llywelyn's childhood, Gwynedd was ruled by two of his uncles, who split the kingdom between them, following the death of Llywelyn's grandfather, [[Owain Gwynedd]], in 1170. Llywelyn had a strong claim to be the legitimate ruler and began a campaign to win power at an early age. He was sole ruler of Gwynedd by 1200 and made a treaty with King [[John of England]] that year. Llywelyn's relations with John remained good for the next ten years. He married John's natural daughter [[Joan, Lady of Wales|Joan]] in 1205, and when John arrested [[Gwenwynwyn ap Owain]] of [[Powys]] in 1208, Llywelyn took the opportunity to annex southern Powys. In 1210, relations deteriorated, and John invaded Gwynedd in 1211. Llywelyn was forced to seek terms and to give up all lands east of the River Conwy, but was able to recover them the following year in alliance with the other Welsh princes. He allied himself with the barons who forced John to sign [[Magna Carta]] in 1215. By 1216, he was the dominant power in Wales, holding a council at [[Aberdyfi]] that year to apportion lands to the other princes.

Following King John's death, Llywelyn concluded the Treaty of Worcester with his successor, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], in 1218. During the next fifteen years, Llywelyn was frequently involved in fights with [[Welsh Marches|Marcher]] lords and sometimes with the king, but also made alliances with several major powers in the Marches. The Peace of Middle in 1234 marked the end of Llywelyn's military career, as the agreed truce of two years was extended year by year for the remainder of his reign. He maintained his position in Wales until his death in 1240 and was succeeded by his son [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]].

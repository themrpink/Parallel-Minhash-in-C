==Jitter conversions==
Phase noise is sometimes also measured and expressed as a power obtained by integrating {{math|ℒ(''f'')}} over a certain range of offset frequencies. For example, the phase noise may be −40&amp;nbsp;dBc integrated over the range of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz to 100&amp;nbsp;kHz. This integrated phase noise (expressed in degrees) can be converted to jitter (expressed in seconds) using the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{jitter (seconds}) = \frac{\text{phase error (} {}^\circ \text{)}}{360^\circ \times \text{frequency (hertz)}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the absence of [[1/f noise]] in a region where the phase noise displays a –20{{nbsp}}dBc/decade slope ([[Leeson's equation]]), the [[root-mean-square|RMS]] cycle jitter can be related to the phase noise by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=An Overview of Phase Noise and Jitter|date=May 17, 2001|url=http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5990-3108EN.pdf|publisher=Keysight Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_c = \frac{f^2 \mathcal{L}\left(f\right)}{f_\text{osc}^3}&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left(f\right) = \frac{f_\text{osc}^3 \sigma_c^2}{f^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Measurement==
Phase noise can be measured using a [[spectrum analyzer]] if the phase noise of the device under test (DUT) is large with respect to the spectrum analyzer's [[local oscillator]]. Care should be taken that observed values are due to the measured signal and not the shape factor of the spectrum analyzer's filters. Spectrum analyzer based measurement can show the phase-noise power over many decades of frequency; e.g., 1&amp;nbsp;Hz to 10&amp;nbsp;MHz.  The slope with offset frequency in various offset frequency regions can provide clues as to the source of the noise; e.g., low frequency [[flicker noise]] decreasing at 30&amp;nbsp;dB per decade (= 9&amp;nbsp;dB per octave).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cerda |first=Ramon M. |title=Impact of ultralow phase noise oscillators on system performance |date=July 2006 |journal=[[RF Design]] |pages=28&amp;ndash;34 |url=http://rfdesign.com/mag/607RFDF2.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase noise measurement systems are alternatives to spectrum analyzers. These systems may use internal and external references and allow measurement of both residual (additive) and absolute noise.  Additionally, these systems can make low-noise, close-to-the-carrier, measurements.

==Spectral purity==
The sinewave output of an ideal [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] is a single line in the frequency spectrum. Such perfect spectral purity is not achievable in a practical oscillator. Spreading of the spectrum line caused by phase noise must be minimised in the local oscillator for a [[superheterodyne receiver]] because it defeats the aim of restricting the receiver frequency range by filters in the IF (intermediate frequency) amplifier.

{{Modulation techniques}}
'''Phase-shift keying''' ('''PSK''') is a [[digital modulation]] process which conveys [[Data (computing)|data]] by changing (modulating) the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a constant [[frequency]] reference [[signal]] (the [[carrier wave]]). The modulation is accomplished by varying the [[sine wave|sine]] and [[cosine wave|cosine]] inputs at a precise time. It is widely used for [[wireless LAN]]s, [[RFID]] and [[Bluetooth]] communication.

Any digital modulation scheme uses a finite number of distinct signals to represent digital data. PSK uses a finite number of phases, each assigned a unique pattern of [[bit|binary digit]]s. Usually, each phase encodes an equal number of bits. Each pattern of bits forms the [[symbol rate|symbol]] that is represented by the particular phase. The [[demodulator]], which is designed specifically for the symbol-set used by the modulator, determines the phase of the received signal and maps it back to the symbol it represents, thus recovering the original data. This requires the receiver to be able to compare the phase of the received signal to a reference signal{{snd}} such a system is termed coherent (and referred to as CPSK).

CPSK requires a complicated demodulator, because it must extract the reference wave from the received signal and keep track of it, to compare each sample to.  Alternatively, the phase shift of each symbol sent can be measured with respect to the phase of the previous symbol sent.  Because the symbols are encoded in the difference in phase between successive samples, this is called '''differential phase-shift keying (DPSK)'''.  DPSK can be significantly simpler to implement than ordinary PSK, as it is a 'non-coherent' scheme, i.e. there is no need for the demodulator to keep track of a reference wave.   A trade-off is that it has more demodulation errors.

==Introduction==
There are three major classes of [[modulation#Digital modulation methods|digital modulation]] techniques used for transmission of [[Digital data|digital]]ly represented data:

* [[Amplitude-shift keying]] (ASK)
* [[Frequency-shift keying]] (FSK)
* Phase-shift keying (PSK)

All convey data by changing some aspect of a base signal, the [[carrier wave]] (usually a [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]), in response to a data signal. In the case of PSK, the phase is changed to represent the data signal. There are two fundamental ways of utilizing the phase of a signal in this way:

* By viewing the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] itself as conveying the information, in which case the [[demodulator]] must have a reference signal to compare the received signal's phase against; or
* By viewing the ''change'' in the phase as conveying information{{snd}} [[#Differential encoding|''differential'']] schemes, [[#Differential phase-shift keying .28DPSK.29|some]] of which do not need a reference carrier (to a certain extent).

A convenient method to represent PSK schemes is on a [[constellation diagram]]. This shows the points in the [[complex plane]] where, in this context, the [[real number|real]] and [[imaginary number|imaginary]] axes are termed the in-phase and quadrature axes respectively due to their 90° separation. Such a representation on perpendicular axes lends itself to straightforward implementation. The amplitude of each point along the in-phase axis is used to modulate a cosine (or sine) wave and the amplitude along the quadrature axis to modulate a sine (or cosine) wave.  By convention, in-phase modulates cosine and quadrature modulates sine.

In PSK, the [[constellation diagram|constellation points]] chosen are usually positioned with uniform [[angle|angular]] spacing around a [[circle]]. This gives maximum phase-separation between adjacent points and thus the best immunity to corruption. They are positioned on a circle so that they can all be transmitted with the same energy. In this way, the moduli of the complex numbers they represent will be the same and thus so will the amplitudes needed for the cosine and sine waves. Two common examples are &quot;binary phase-shift keying&quot; ([[#Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)|BPSK]]) which uses two phases, and &quot;quadrature phase-shift keying&quot; ([[#Quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)|QPSK]]) which uses four phases, although any number of phases may be used. Since the data to be conveyed are usually binary, the PSK scheme is usually designed with the number of constellation points being a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of two.

===Definitions===
For determining error-rates mathematically, some definitions will be needed:

* &lt;math&gt;E_b&lt;/math&gt;,            energy per [[bit]]
* &lt;math&gt;E_s = nE_b&lt;/math&gt;,     energy per symbol with ''n'' bits
* &lt;math&gt;T_b&lt;/math&gt;,            [[bit rate|bit duration]]
* &lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt;,            [[symbol rate|symbol duration]]
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}N_0&lt;/math&gt;, [[signal noise|noise]] [[spectral density|power spectral density]] ([[watt|W]]/[[hertz|Hz]])
* &lt;math&gt;P_b&lt;/math&gt;,            [[probability]] of ''bit-error''
* &lt;math&gt;P_s&lt;/math&gt;,            probability of symbol-error

&lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; will give the probability that a single sample taken from a random process with zero-mean and unit-variance [[Normal distribution|Gaussian probability density function]] will be greater or equal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. It is a scaled form of the [[Error function|complementary Gaussian error function]]:

: &lt;math&gt;Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_x^\infty e^{-\frac{1}{2}t^2} \,dt = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right),\ x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The error rates quoted here are those in [[additive white Gaussian noise]] (AWGN). These error rates are lower than those computed in [[fading channel]]s, hence, are a good theoretical benchmark to compare with.

==Applications==
Owing to PSK's simplicity, particularly when compared with its competitor [[quadrature amplitude modulation]], it is widely used in existing technologies.

The [[wireless LAN]] standard, [[IEEE 802.11b-1999]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ref80211&quot;&gt;[http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-1999.pdf IEEE Std 802.11-1999: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications]{{snd}} the overarching IEEE 802.11 specification. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828223638/http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-1999.pdf |date=August 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;80211b&quot;&gt;[http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11b-1999.pdf IEEE Std 802.11b-1999 (R2003)]{{snd}} the IEEE 802.11b specification.&lt;/ref&gt; uses a variety of different PSKs depending on the data rate required. At the basic rate of 1{{nbsp}}[[Mbit]]/s, it uses DBPSK (differential BPSK). To provide the extended rate of 2{{nbsp}}Mbit/s, DQPSK is used. In reaching 5.5{{nbsp}}Mbit/s and the full rate of 11{{nbsp}}Mbit/s, QPSK is employed, but has to be coupled with [[complementary code keying]]. The higher-speed wireless LAN standard, [[IEEE 802.11g-2003]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ref80211&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;80211g&quot;&gt;[http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11g-2003.pdf IEEE Std 802.11g-2003]{{snd}} the IEEE 802.11g specification.&lt;/ref&gt; has eight data rates: 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54{{nbsp}}Mbit/s. The 6 and 9{{nbsp}}Mbit/s modes use [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]] modulation where each sub-carrier is BPSK modulated. The 12 and 18{{nbsp}}Mbit/s modes use OFDM with QPSK. The fastest four modes use OFDM with forms of [[quadrature amplitude modulation]].

Because of its simplicity, BPSK is appropriate for low-cost passive transmitters, and is used in [[RFID]] standards such as [[ISO/IEC 14443]] which has been adopted for [[biometric passport]]s, credit cards such as [[American Express]]'s [[ExpressPay]], and many other applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2056.pdf Understanding the Requirements of ISO/IEC 14443 for Type B Proximity Contactless Identification Cards], Application Note, Rev. 2056B–RFID–11/05, 2005, ATMEL.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bluetooth]] 2 uses &lt;math&gt;\pi/4&lt;/math&gt;-DQPSK at its lower rate (2{{nbsp}}Mbit/s) and 8-DPSK at its higher rate (3{{nbsp}}Mbit/s) when the link between the two devices is sufficiently robust. Bluetooth 1 modulates with [[Minimum-shift keying|Gaussian minimum-shift keying]], a binary scheme, so either modulation choice in version 2 will yield a higher data-rate. A similar technology, [[IEEE 802.15.4]] (the wireless standard used by [[ZigBee]]) also relies on PSK using two frequency bands: 868–915{{nbsp}}[[Megahertz|MHz]] with BPSK and at 2.4{{nbsp}}[[Hertz|GHz]] with OQPSK.

Both QPSK and 8PSK are widely used in satellite broadcasting. QPSK is still widely used in the streaming of SD satellite channels and some HD channels. High definition programming is delivered almost exclusively in 8PSK due to the higher bitrates of HD video and the high cost of satellite bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://planetfox.net/microwaves/howitworks.html | title = How Communications Satellites Work | website = Planet Fox | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DVB-S2]] standard requires support for both QPSK and 8PSK. The chipsets used in new satellite set top boxes, such as [[Broadcom]]'s 7000 series support 8PSK and are backward compatible with the older standard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcom.com/products/set-top-box-and-media-processors/satellite/bcm7325&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, voice-band synchronous [[modems]] such as the Bell 201, 208, and 209 and the CCITT V.26, V.27, V.29, V.32, and V.34 used PSK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.blackbox.com/resource/files/productdetails/19558.PDF|title = Local and Remote Modems|access-date = December 20, 2015|website = Black Box|publisher = Black Box Network Services|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222112409/http://www.blackbox.com/resource/files/productdetails/19558.PDF|archive-date = December 22, 2015|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)==
{{Anchor|BPSK}}
[[File:BPSK Gray Coded.svg|200px|right|thumb|[[Constellation diagram]] example for BPSK]]

BPSK (also sometimes called PRK, phase reversal keying, or 2PSK) is the simplest form of phase shift keying (PSK). It uses two phases which are separated by 180° and so can also be termed 2-PSK. It does not particularly matter exactly where the constellation points are positioned, and in this figure they are shown on the real axis, at 0° and 180°. Therefore, it handles the highest noise level or distortion before the [[demodulator]] reaches an incorrect decision. That makes it the most robust of all the PSKs. It is, however, only able to modulate at 1{{nbsp}}bit/symbol (as seen in the figure) and so is unsuitable for high data-rate applications.

In the presence of an arbitrary phase-shift introduced by the [[communications channel]], the demodulator (see, e.g. [[Costas loop]])  is unable to tell which constellation point is which. As a result, the data is often [[#Differential encoding|differentially encoded]] prior to modulation.

BPSK is functionally equivalent to [[Quadrature amplitude modulation|2-QAM]] modulation.

===Implementation===
The general form for BPSK follows the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;s_n(t) =   \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{T_b}} \cos(2 \pi f t + \pi(1-n )),\quad n = 0,1. &lt;/math&gt;

This yields two phases, 0 and π.
In the specific form, binary data is often conveyed with the following signals:{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

:&lt;math&gt;s_0(t) =   \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{T_b}} \cos(2 \pi f t + \pi )
              = - \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{T_b}} \cos(2 \pi f t)&lt;/math&gt; for binary &quot;0&quot;
:&lt;math&gt;s_1(t) = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{T_b}} \cos(2 \pi f t) &lt;/math&gt; for binary &quot;1&quot;

where ''f'' is the frequency of the base band.

Hence, the signal space can be represented by the single [[basis function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{T_b}} \cos(2 \pi f t) &lt;/math&gt;

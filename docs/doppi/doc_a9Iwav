'''Charles Hoy Fort''' (August 6, 1874 – May 3, 1932) was an American writer and researcher who specialized in [[Anomalistics|anomalous phenomena]]. The terms ''Fortean'' and ''Forteana'' are sometimes used to characterize various such phenomena. Fort's books sold well and are still in print. His work continues to inspire admirers, who refer to themselves as &quot;Forteans&quot;, and has influenced some aspects of science fiction.

Fort's collections of scientific anomalies, including ''[[The Book of the Damned]]'' (1919), influenced numerous science fiction writers with their [[skepticism]] and as sources of ideas. &quot;Fortean&quot; phenomena are events which seem to challenge the boundaries of accepted scientific knowledge, and the ''[[Fortean Times]]'' (founded as ''The News'' in 1973 and renamed in 1976) investigates such phenomena.

==Biography==

Fort was born in Albany, New York in 1874,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadersDigest&quot;/&gt; of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ancestry. His father, a grocer, was an authoritarian and, in his unpublished autobiography ''Many Parts,'' Fort mentions the physical abuse he endured from his father. Fort's biographer, [[Damon Knight]], suggested that his distrust of authority began in his treatment as a child. Fort developed a strong sense of independence during his early years.

As a young adult, Fort wanted to be a [[natural history|naturalist]], collecting [[sea shell]]s, minerals, and birds. Although Fort was described as curious and intelligent, he was not a good student. An [[autodidact]], his considerable knowledge of the world was due mainly to his extensive personal reading.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

At age 18, Fort left New York to embark on a world tour to &quot;put some capital in the bank of experience&quot;. He travelled through the western United States, Scotland, and England, until becoming ill in Southern Africa. When he returned home, he was nursed by Anna Filing, whom he had known since childhood. They were married on October 26, 1896. Anna, four years older than Fort, was non-literary, a lover of movies and of parakeets. For a couple years, the newly-married couple lived in poverty in the Bronx while Fort tried to earning a living writing stories for newspapers and magazines. In 1906, he began to collect accounts of anomalies.&lt;ref name=&quot;mingren&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/charles-fort-pioneer-search-scientific-anomalies-or-anti-dogmatist-who-020782 |title=Charles Fort: Pioneer in the Search for Scientific Anomalies or Anti-dogmatist who Collected Bizarre Stories? |last=Mingren |first=Wu |date=25 March 2016 |website=Ancient Origins |access-date=29 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career as a full-time writer===

His uncle died in 1916,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} and a modest inheritance gave Fort enough money to quit his various [[day job]]s and to write full-time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadersDigest&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bill Bradbury|title=Tiedon rajamailla|trans-title=Into the Unknown|date=1982|language=Finnish|publisher=[[Reader's Digest]]|isbn=978-951-9078-89-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Fort's brother Clarence died; his portion of the same inheritance was divided between Fort and Raymond.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Fort's experience as a journalist,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadersDigest&quot;/&gt; coupled with his wit and contrarian nature, prepared him for his real-life work, ridiculing the pretensions of scientific [[logical positivism|positivism]] and the tendency of journalists and editors of newspapers and [[scientific journal]]s to rationalize.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Fort wrote ten novels, although only one, ''[[The Outcast Manufacturers]]'' (1909), a tenement tale, was published. Reviews were mostly positive, but it was unsuccessful commercially. During 1915, Fort began to write two books, titled ''X'' and ''Y'', the first dealing with the idea that beings on [[Mars]] were controlling events on Earth, and the second with the postulation of a sinister civilization extant at the South Pole. These books caught the attention of writer [[Theodore Dreiser]], who tried to get them published, but to no avail. Discouraged, Fort burnt the manuscripts, but soon began work on the book that would change the course of his life, ''[[The Book of the Damned]]'' (1919), which Dreiser helped to get published. The title referred to &quot;damned&quot; data that Fort collected, phenomena for which science could not account and that was thus rejected or ignored.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley&quot;&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1931/03/01/archives/charles-fort-enfant-terrible-of-science.html?searchResultPosition=1 &quot;Charles Fort, Enfant Terrible of Science,&quot;] [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1931/03/01/118400918.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&amp;ip=0 | Archived] via the [[The New York Times#TimesMachine|TimesMachine]],''[[The New York Times]]'', 29 July 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fort and Anna lived in London from 1924 to 1926, having relocated there so Fort could peruse the files of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadersDigest&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://stutteringhand.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/charles-fort/ Charles Fort], Shutteringhand, April 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Although born in Albany, Fort lived most of his life in the Bronx. He was, like his wife, fond of movies, and would often take her from their Ryer Avenue apartment to a movie theater nearby, stopping at an adjacent newsstand for an armful of various newspapers. Fort frequented the parks near the Bronx, where he would sift through piles of clippings. He would often ride the subway down to the main Public Library on Fifth Avenue, where he would spend many hours reading scientific journals, newspapers, and periodicals from around the world. Fort also had literary friends who would gather at various apartments, including his own, to drink and talk.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Death===

Suffering from poor health and failing eyesight, Fort was pleasantly surprised to find himself the subject of a [[cult following]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} There was talk of the formation of a formal organization to study the type of odd events related by his books. Clark writes, &quot;Fort himself, who did nothing to encourage any of this, found the idea hilarious. Yet he faithfully corresponded with his readers, some of whom had taken to investigating reports of anomalous phenomena and sending their findings to Fort&quot; (Clark 1998, 235). Fort distrusted doctors and did not seek medical help for his worsening health. Rather, he emphasized completing ''Wild Talents''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

After he collapsed on May 3, 1932, Fort was rushed to [[Royal Hospital, The Bronx|Royal Hospital]] in [[The Bronx]]. Later that same day, Fort's publisher visited him to show him the advance copies of ''Wild Talents''. Fort died only hours afterward, probably of [[leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forteana.org/html/fortbiog.html &quot;Charles Fort: His Life and Times&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408071240/http://www.forteana.org/html/fortbiog.html |date=April 8, 2007 }} by Bob Rickard; 1995, revised 1997. Retrieved March 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the Fort family plot in Albany, New York. His more than 60,000 notes were donated to the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYPL-Thayer/Fort&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Tiffany Thayer papers. (MssCol 2971) |url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/2971 |website=The New York Public Library Archives &amp; Manuscripts |accessdate=July 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725153359/http://archives.nypl.org/mss/2971 |archive-date=July 25, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort and the unexplained==

===Overview===
For more than thirty years, Charles Fort visited libraries in New York City and London, assiduously reading scientific journals, newspapers, and magazines, collecting notes on [[phenomena]] that were not explained well by the accepted theories and beliefs of the time.

Fort took thousands of notes during his lifetime. In his short story &quot;The Giant, the Insect and The Philanthropic-looking Old Gentleman&quot; (first published by the [[International Fortean Organization]] in issue No. 70 of the ''INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown''), Fort spoke of sitting on a park bench at [[The Cloisters]] in New York City and tossing some 48,000 notes, not all of his collection by any means, into the wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Giant, the Insect, and the Philanthropic-looking Old Gentleman&quot; by Charles Hoy Fort|url=http://www.resologist.net/story29.htm|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notes were kept on cards and scraps of paper in shoeboxes, in a cramped [[shorthand]] of Fort's own invention, and some of them survive in the collections of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. More than once, depressed and discouraged, Fort destroyed his work, but began anew. Some notes were published by the [[Fortean Society]] magazine ''Doubt'' and, upon the death of its editor [[Tiffany Thayer]] in 1959 most were donated to the New York Public Library, where they are still available to researchers of the unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives and manuscripts Fort, Charles, 1874–1932|url=http://archives.nypl.org/controlaccess/13206?term=Fort,%20Charles,%201874-1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this research, Fort wrote four books. These are: ''The Book of the Damned'' (1919), ''[[New Lands]]'' (1923), ''[[Lo!]]'' (1931) and ''[[Wild Talents]]'' (1932); one book was written between ''New Lands'' and ''Lo!'' but it was abandoned and absorbed into ''Lo!.''

===Fort's writing style===
Fort suggested that there is a Super-Sargasso Sea into which all lost things go,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadersDigest&quot;/&gt; and justified his theories by noting that they fit the data as well as the conventional explanations. As to whether Fort ''believed'' this theory, or any of his other proposals, he himself noted, &quot;I believe nothing of my own that I have ever written.&quot;

Notable literary contemporaries of Fort openly admired his writing style and befriended him. Among these were: [[Ben Hecht]], [[John Cowper Powys]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Clarence Darrow]], and [[Booth Tarkington]].

After Fort's death, the writer [[Colin Wilson]] said that he suspected that Fort took few if any of his &quot;explanations&quot; seriously and noted that Fort made &quot;no attempt to present a coherent argument&quot;. He described Fort as &quot;a patron saint of cranks&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Wilson|Wilson, Colin]], ''Mysteries'', Putnam ({{ISBN|0-399-12246-X}}), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; while at the same time he compared Fort to [[Robert Ripley]], a popular contemporary [[cartoonist]] and writer who found major success publishing similar oddities in a syndicated newspaper panel series named ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]''

Wilson called Fort's writing style &quot;atrocious&quot; and &quot;almost unreadable&quot;, yet despite his objections to Fort's prose, he allowed that &quot;the facts are certainly astonishing enough.&quot; In the end, Fort's work gave him &quot;the feeling that no matter how honest scientists ''think'' they are, they are still influenced by various ''unconscious'' assumptions that prevent them from attaining true objectivity. Expressed in a sentence, Fort's principle goes something like this: People with a psychological need to ''believe'' in marvels are no more prejudiced and gullible than people with a psychological need ''not'' to believe in marvels.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Colin: ''ibid.'', p. 201 (emphasis in original).&lt;/ref&gt;

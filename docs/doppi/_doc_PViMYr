      <text bytes="1272" xml:space="preserve">A '''T-interface'''  or '''T reference point''' is used for [[basic rate access]] in an [[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN) environment.  It is a [[User–network interface]] [[Integrated_Services_Digital_Network#Reference_points|reference point]] that is characterized by a four-wire, 144 [[kilobit|kbit]]/s (2B+D) user rate.

Other characteristics of a T-interface are:
* it accommodates the [[link access]] and [[transport layer]] function in the ISDN architecture
* it is located at the user premises
* it is distance sensitive to the servicing [[Network termination 1]]
* it functions in a manner similar to that of the [[Channel service unit]]s (CSUs) and the [[Data service unit]]s (DSUs).&lt;ref name=&quot;FS1037C&quot;&gt;{{FS1037C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="17333" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|The distortion produced by an amplifier, as measured in terms of the harmonics of the sinusoidal components of the signal that it introduces.}}
The '''total harmonic distortion''' ('''THD''' or '''THDi''') is a measurement of the [[harmonic distortion]] present in a signal and is defined as the ratio of the sum of the powers of all harmonic components to the power of the [[fundamental frequency]]. '''Distortion factor''', a closely related term, is sometimes used as a synonym.

In audio systems, lower distortion means the components in a loudspeaker, amplifier or microphone or other equipment produce a more accurate reproduction of an audio recording.

In radio communications, devices with lower THD tend to produce less unintentional interference with other electronic devices. Since harmonic distortion tends to widen the frequency spectrum of the output emissions from a device by adding signals at multiples of the input frequency, devices with high THD are less suitable in applications such as [[spectrum sharing]] and [[spectrum sensing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iaroslav_04&quot;&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260672713_Analytic_Method_for_the_Computation_of_the_Total_Harmonic_Distortion_by_the_Cauchy_Method_of_Residues Iaroslav Blagouchine and Eric Moreau. ''Analytic Method for the Computation of the Total Harmonic Distortion by the Cauchy Method of Residues.'' IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 59, no. 9, pp. 2478–2491, September 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In power systems, lower THD implies lower peak currents, less heating, lower electromagnetic emissions, and less core loss in motors.&lt;ref name=&quot;aspowertechnologies.com&quot;&gt;[https://www.aptsources.com/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/Total-Harmonic-Distortion-and-Effects-in-Electrical-Power-Systems.pdf Total Harmonic Distortion and Effects in Electrical Power Systems – Associated Power Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; IEEE std 519-2014  covers the recommended practice and requirements for harmonic control in electric power systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://standards.ieee.org/standard/519-2014.html Recommended Practice and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and examples==
To understand a system with an input and an output, such as an audio amplifier, we start with an ideal system where the [[Transfer Function|transfer function]] is [[LTI system theory|linear and time-invariant]]. When a sinusoidal signal of frequency ω passes through a non-ideal, non-linear device, additional content is added at multiples nω (harmonics) of the original frequency. THD is a measure of that additional signal content not present in the input signal.

When the main performance criterion is the ″purity″ of the original sine wave (in other words, the contribution of the original frequency with respect to its harmonics), the measurement is most commonly defined as the ratio of the RMS amplitude of a set of higher [[harmonic]] frequencies to the [[RMS amplitude]] of the first harmonic, or [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]], frequency&lt;ref name=&quot;iaroslav_04&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aspowertechnologies.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eng.tau.ac.il&quot;&gt;[http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~shmilo/10.pdf On the Definition of Total Harmonic Distortion and Its Effect on Measurement Interpretation], Doron Shmilovitz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the RMS voltage of the ''n''th harmonic and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is the fundamental frequency.

In practice, the THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is commonly used in audio distortion specifications (percentage THD); however, THD is a non-standardized specification and the results between manufacturers are not easily comparable. Since individual harmonic amplitudes are measured, it is required that the manufacturer disclose the test signal frequency range, level and gain conditions, and number of measurements taken. It is possible to measure the full 20–20&amp;nbsp;kHz range using a sweep (though distortion for a fundamental above 10&amp;nbsp;kHz is inaudible).

Measurements for calculating the THD are made at the output of a device under specified conditions. The THD is usually expressed in [[percent]] or in [[Decibel|dB]] relative to the fundamental as distortion attenuation.

A variant definition uses the fundamental plus harmonics as the reference, though usage is discouraged:&lt;ref name=&quot;eng.tau.ac.il&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrepq.com/pdfs/BAPTISTA317.pdf VOLTAGE WAVE QUALITY IN LOW VOLTAGE POWER SYSTEMS José M. R. Baptista, Manuel R. Cordeiro, and A. Machado e Moura]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xxbvM40Wwa8C&amp;dq=thdf+thdr&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Power Electronics Handbook] edited by Timothy L.

&lt;/math&gt;
These can be distinguished as '''THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''' (for &quot;fundamental&quot;), and '''THD&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''' (for &quot;root mean square&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://panelmeters.weschler.com/Asset/AEMC-605-UserManual.pdf AEMC 605 User Manual] &quot;THDf: Total harmonic distortion with respect to the fundamental.

At low distortion levels, the difference between the two calculation methods is negligible.  For instance, a signal with THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; of 10% has a very similar THD&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; of 9.95%.  However, at higher distortion levels the discrepancy becomes large.  For instance, a signal with THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; 266% has a THD&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; of 94%.&lt;ref name=&quot;eng.tau.ac.il&quot;/&gt; A pure [[square wave]] with infinite harmonics has THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; of 48.3%,&lt;ref name=&quot;iaroslav_04&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eletrica.ufpr.br/edu/artigos/TeD2004_artigo282.pdf Total Harmonic Distortion Calculation by Filtering for Power Quality Monitoring]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_LhFxN7sUXEC&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;ots=ovMKpXD1QA&amp;dq=43.5%20%22square%20wave%22%20THD&amp;pg=PA178#v=onepage&amp;q=43.5%20%22square%20wave%22%20THD&amp;f=false Electric Machines By Charles A.

The IEC defines the term &quot;total harmonic factor&quot; as :&lt;math&gt; d = \frac{ \sqrt{E^2_\mathrm{eff} - E^2_\mathrm{eff\,1}}}{E_\mathrm{eff}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=103-07-32&lt;/ref&gt;

==THD+N==
'''THD+N''' means total harmonic distortion plus noise. This measurement is much more common and more comparable between devices. It is usually measured by inputting a [[sine wave]], [[notch filter]]ing the output, and comparing the ratio between the output signal with and without the sine wave:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rane.com/note145.html Rane audio's definition of both THD and THD+N]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{THD\!\!+\!\!N} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{n=2}^\infty{\text{harmonics}} + \text{noise}}{\text{fundamental}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Like the THD measurement, this is a ratio of RMS amplitudes,&lt;ref name=&quot;MT-003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-053.pdf Op Amp Distortion: HD, THD, THD + N, IMD, SFDR, MTPR]&lt;/ref&gt; and can be measured as THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; (bandpassed or calculated fundamental as the denominator) or, more commonly, as THD&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; (total distorted signal as the denominator).  Audio Precision measurements are THD&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ap.com/solutions/introtoaudiotest/thd+n Introduction to the Basic Six Audio Tests] &quot;Since the sum of the distortion products will always be less than the total signal, the THD+N Ratio will always be a negative decibel value, or a percent value less than 100%.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A meaningful measurement must include the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of measurement. This measurement includes effects from [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] power line hum, high-frequency interference, [[intermodulation distortion]] between these tones and the fundamental, and so on, in addition to harmonic distortion. For psychoacoustic measurements, a weighting curve is applied such as [[A-weighting]] or [[ITU-R BS.468]], which is intended to accentuate what is most audible to the human ear, contributing to a more accurate measurement.

For a given input frequency and amplitude, THD+N is reciprocal to [[SINAD]], provided that both measurements are made over the same bandwidth.

==Measurement==
The distortion of a [[waveform]] relative to a pure sinewave can be measured either by using a [[THD analyzer]] to [[Fourier analysis|analyse the output wave into its constituent harmonics]] and noting the amplitude of each relative to the fundamental; or by cancelling out the fundamental with a [[notch filter]] and measuring the remaining signal, which will be total aggregate harmonic distortion plus noise.

Given a sinewave generator of very low inherent distortion, it can be used as input to amplification equipment, whose distortion at different frequencies and signal levels can be measured by examining the output waveform.

There is electronic equipment both to generate sinewaves and to measure distortion; but a general-purpose [[digital computer]] equipped with a [[sound card]] can carry out harmonic analysis with suitable software. Different software can be used to generate sinewaves, but the inherent distortion may be too high for measurement of very low-distortion amplifiers.

=== Interpretation ===
For many purposes different types of harmonics are not equivalent.  For instance, crossover distortion at a given THD is much more audible than clipping distortion at the same THD, since the harmonics produced are at higher frequencies, which are not as easily [[Auditory masking|masked]] by the fundamental.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sound.whsites.net/valves/valve-trans.html#s33 Distortion – Valves vs. Transistors]&lt;/ref&gt;  A single THD number is inadequate to specify audibility, and must be interpreted with care.  Taking THD measurements at different output levels would expose whether the distortion is clipping (which increases with level) or crossover (which decreases with level).

THD is an average of a number of harmonics equally weighted, even though research performed decades ago identifies that lower order harmonics are harder to hear at the same level, compared with higher order ones. In addition, even order harmonics are said to be generally harder to hear than odd order.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gearslutz.com/board/so-much-gear-so-little-time/382595-odd-vs-even-harmonic-distortion.html]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of formulas that attempt to correlate THD with actual audibility have been published, however none have gained mainstream use.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Examples==
For many standard signals, the above criterion may be calculated analytically in a closed form.&lt;ref name=&quot;iaroslav_04&quot; /&gt; For example, a pure [[square wave]] has THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; equal to
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{THD_F} \,= \,\sqrt{\frac{\,\pi^2}{8}-1\,}\approx \, 0.483\,=\,48.3\%
&lt;/math&gt;
The [[Sawtooth wave|sawtooth signal]] possesses
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{THD_F} \,= \,\sqrt{\frac{\,\pi^2}{6}-1\,}\approx \, 0.803\,=\,80.3\%
&lt;/math&gt;
The pure symmetrical [[triangle wave]] has THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{THD_F} \,= \,\sqrt{\frac{\,\pi^4}{96}-1\,}\approx\,0.121\,= \, 12.1\%
&lt;/math&gt;
For the rectangular [[pulse train]] with the ''[[duty cycle]]'' ''μ'' (called sometimes the ''cyclic ratio''),
the THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; has the form
: &lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{THD_F}\,(\mu)=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-\mu)\pi^2\,}{2\sin^2\pi\mu}-1\;}\,,\qquad 0&lt;\mu&lt;1
&lt;/math&gt;
and logically, reaches the minimum (≈0.483) when the signal becomes symmetrical ''μ''=0.5, ''i.e.'' the pure [[square wave]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iaroslav_04&quot; /&gt; Appropriate filtering of these signals may drastically reduce the resulting THD. For instance, the pure [[square wave]] filtered by the [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth low-pass filter]] of the second-order (with the [[cutoff frequency]] set equal to the fundamental frequency) has THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; of 5.3%, while the same signal filtered by the fourth-order filter has THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;iaroslav_04&quot; /&gt; However, analytic computation of the THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; for complicated waveforms and filters often represents a difficult task, and the resulting expressions may be quite laborious to obtain. For example, the closed-form expression for the THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[sawtooth wave]] filtered by the first-order [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth low-pass filter]] is simply
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{THD_F}\,= \,
\sqrt{\frac{\,\pi^2}{3} - \pi\coth\pi\,}\,\approx\,0.370\,= \, 37.0\%
&lt;/math&gt;
while that for the same signal filtered by the second-order [[Butterworth filter]] is given by
a rather cumbersome formula&lt;ref name=&quot;iaroslav_04&quot; /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{THD_F}\,=
\sqrt{\pi\,\frac{\;
\cot\dfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{2\,}}\cdot\coth^{2\!}\dfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{2\,}}
-\cot^{2\!}\dfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{2\,}}\cdot\coth\dfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{2\,}}
-\cot\dfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{2\,}} - \coth\dfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{2\,}}\;}
{\sqrt{2\,}\left(\!\cot^{2\!}\dfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{2\,}}
+\coth^{2\!}\dfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{2\,}}\!\right)}
\,+\,\frac{\,\pi^2}{3} \,-\, 1\;}
\;\approx\;0.181\,= \, 18.1\%
&lt;/math&gt;
Yet, the closed-form expression for the THD&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[pulse train]] filtered by the ''p''th-order [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth low-pass filter]] is even more complicated and has the following form
: &lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{THD_F}\,(\mu, p)= \csc\pi\mu\,\cdot \!\sqrt{\mu(1-\mu)\pi^2-\,\sin^2\!\pi\mu\,
-\,\frac{\,\pi}{2}\sum_{s=1}^{2p} \frac{\cot \pi z_s}{z_s^2}
\prod\limits_{\scriptstyle l=1\atop\scriptstyle l\neq s}^{2p}\!\frac{1}{\,z_s-z_l\,}\,
+\,\frac{\,\pi}{2}\,\mathrm{Re}\sum_{s=1}^{2p} \frac{e^{i\pi z_s(2\mu-1)}}{z_s^2\sin \pi z_s}
\prod\limits_{\scriptstyle l=1\atop\scriptstyle l\neq s}^{2p}\!\frac{1}{\,z_s-z_l\,}\,}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''μ'' is the [[duty cycle]], 0&lt;''μ''&lt;1,  and
: &lt;math&gt;
z_l\equiv \exp{\frac{i\pi(2l-1)}{2p}}\,, \qquad l=1, 2,\ldots, 2p
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[telecommunication]] networks, '''traffic intensity''' is a measure of the average occupancy of a server or resource during a specified period of [[time]], normally a [[busy hour]]. It is measured in [[Teletraffic|traffic]] units ([[Erlang unit|erlang]]s) and defined as the ratio of the time during which a facility is cumulatively occupied to the time this facility is available for occupancy.  

In a digital network, the traffic intensity is:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''a'' is the average arrival rate of packets (e.g. in packets per second)
:''L'' is the average packet length (e.g. in bits), and
:''R'' is the transmission rate (e.g. bits per second)

A traffic intensity greater than one erlang means that the rate at which bits arrive exceeds the rate bits can be transmitted and [[queuing delay]] will grow without bound (if the traffic intensity stays the same). If the traffic intensity is less than one erlang, then the router can handle more average traffic. 

Telecommunication operators are vitally interested in traffic intensity, as it dictates the amount of equipment they must supply.

{{inline|date=August 2020}}
In [[Radio|radio communication]], a '''transceiver''' is a device that is able to both transmit and receive information through a [[transmission medium]]. It is a combination of a [[transmitter|''trans''mitter]] and a [[Radio receiver|re''ceiver'']], hence the name ''transceiver''.  Transmission is usually accomplished via [[radio wave]]s, but [[communications satellite]]s, [[Wired communication|wired connections]], and [[optical fiber]] systems can also be used.

[[Radio frequency]] (RF) transceivers are widely used in [[wireless devices]].  For example, [[cell phones]] use them to connect to [[cellular network]]s.  Other common examples include [[walkie-talkie]]s and [[CB radio]]s.  By combining a receiver and transmitter in one consolidated device, a transceiver allows for greater flexibility than what either of these could provide individually.

Despite the widespread use of transceivers, one common system that does not use them is [[FM radio]].  In FM radio, receiving and transmitting data are intentionally two separate jobs.  Radio stations transmit music, news, and other data over analog radio wave signals (and, more recently, digital signals) and FM radios in homes and cars receive these signals for listeners to enjoy.  This system restricts who is allowed to broadcast.

==History==
[[File:Icom.png|thumb|A modern [[High frequency|HF]] transceiver with a [[spectrum analyzer]] and [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] capabilities]]
The transceiver first appeared in the 1920s.  Before then, receivers and transmitters were manufactured separately and devices that wanted to receive and transmit data required both components.  Almost all amateur radio equipment today uses transceivers, but there is an active market for pure radio receivers, which are mainly used by [[shortwave listening]] operators. 

===Analog===
Analog transceivers use [[frequency modulation]] to send and receive data.  Although this technique limits the complexity of the data that can be broadcast, analog transceivers operate very reliably and are used in many emergency communication systems.  They are also cheaper than digital transceivers, which makes them popular with the [[Citizens band radio|CB]] and [[HAM radio]] communities.

===Digital===
Digital transceivers send and receive [[binary data]] over radio waves.  This allows more types of data to be broadcast, including video and encrypted communication, which is commonly used by police and fire departments.  Digital transmissions tend to be clearer and more detailed than their analog counterparts. Many modern wireless devices operate on digital transmissions.

===Telephony===

&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Headphones]]. --&gt;
In a wired [[telephone]], the handset contains the transmitter (for speaking) and receiver (for listening).  Despite being able to transmit and receive data, the whole unit is colloquially referred to as a &quot;receiver&quot;.  On a [[mobile telephone]] or other [[radiotelephone]], the entire unit is a transceiver for both audio and radio.

A [[cordless telephone]] uses an audio and radio transceiver for the handset, and a radio transceiver for the [[base station]]. If a [[speakerphone]] is included in a wired telephone base or in a cordless base station, the base also becomes an audio transceiver.

As per their website, Friends of the Earth groups are required to act independently of party political, religious or other influences; be open, [[democracy|democratic]] and non-discriminatory in their internal structures; and be willing to cooperate with other organizations who are working for the same goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOEI Membership Criteria&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foei.org/en/who-we-are/about/membercriteria.html|title=Home - Friends of the earth international|accessdate=25 May 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831113748/http://www.foei.org/en/who-we-are/about/membercriteria.html|archivedate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are conditions of remaining a member of FOEI.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOEI Membership Criteria&quot;/&gt;

The national groups work on the main issues affecting their own country and choose to participate in the international campaigns of FoEI which are relevant to them. In turn, the local campaigners can work on local, national and/or international campaigns.

== Structure of the network ==
The member organization in a particular country may name itself Friends of the Earth or an equivalent translated phrase in the national language, e.g., [[Friends of the Earth (US)]], [[Friends of the Earth (EWNI)]] (England Wales and Northern Ireland), [[Amigos de la Tierra]] (Spain and Argentina). However, roughly half of the member groups work under their own names, sometimes reflecting an independent origin and subsequent accession to the network, such as [[Pro Natura (Switzerland)]], the [[Korean Federation for Environmental Movement]], [[Environmental Rights Action (FOE Nigeria)]] and [[WALHI]] (FOE Indonesia).

Friends of the Earth International (FoEI) is supported by a secretariat based in [[Amsterdam]], and an executive committee known as ExCom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foei.org/en/who-we-are/about/staff.html|title=International secretariat|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ExCom is elected by all member groups at a [[general meeting]] held every two years, and it is the ExCom which employs the secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foei.org/en/who-we-are/about/structure.html|title=Home - Friends of the earth international|accessdate=25 May 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409015123/http://www.foei.org/en/who-we-are/about/structure.html|archivedate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same general meeting, overall policies and priority activities are agreed.

In addition to work which is coordinated at the FoEI level, national member groups are free to carry out their own campaigns and to work bi- or multi-laterally as they see fit, as long as this does not go against agreed policy at the international level.

== Publications ==
[[File:Meat Atlas 2014 – Cover.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Meat Atlas|'Friends of the Earth' publication ''Meat Atlas'' includes graphs on the consumption and production of meat.]]

Friends of the Earth supported the publication of [[Frances Moore Lappé]]'s 1971 book [[Diet for a Small Planet]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The ''[[Meat Atlas]]'' is an annual report on the methods and impact of [[Intensive animal farming|industrial animal agriculture]]. The publication consists of 27 short essays and, with the help of graphs, visualises facts about the production and consumption of meat. The Meat Atlas is jointly published by Friends of the Earth and [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.foeeurope.org/meat-atlas ''Meat Atlas''], Friends of the Earth, download [https://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/publications/foee_hbf_meatatlas_jan2014.pdf Meat Atlas] as pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Document Style Semantics and Specification Language''' ('''DSSSL''') is an international standard developed to provide [[Style sheet language|stylesheets]] for [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]] documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;stylesheets&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ossenbruggen|first=Jacco van|author2=Lynda Hardman |author3=Lloyd Rutledge |author4=Anton Eliens |title=Style Sheet Languages for Hypertext|url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jrvosse/publications/1997/dv:siglink.pdf|publisher=Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI)|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DSSSL consists of two parts: a tree transformation process that can be used to manipulate the tree structure of documents prior to presentation, and a formatting process that associates the elements in the source document with specific nodes in the target representation—the flow object tree. DSSSL specifications are device-independent pieces of information that can be interchanged between different platforms. DSSSL does not standardize the back-end formatters that generate the language's output. Such formatters may render the output for on-screen display, or write it to a [[computer file]] in a specific [[File format|format]] (such as [[PostScript]] or [[Rich Text Format]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stylesheets&quot;/&gt;

Based on a subset of the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme programming language]], it is specified by the standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 10179:1996. It was developed by [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34]] (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 - Document description and processing languages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_technical_committee.html?commid=45374 | title=JTC 1/SC 34 - Document description and processing languages | author=ISO | publisher=ISO | accessdate=2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kikaku.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc34/ |title=JTC 1/SC 34 - Document Description and Processing Languages |author=ISO JTC1/SC34 |accessdate=2009-12-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506050220/http://kikaku.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc34/ |archivedate=2014-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SGML contains information in a machine-readable but not very [[human-readable]] format. A &quot;stylesheet&quot; is used to present the information stored in SGML in a more pleasing or accessible way. DSSSL can convert to a wide range of formats, including [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], [[HTML]], and [[LaTeX]].

DSSSL is compatible with any SGML-based document type,&lt;ref name=&quot;stylesheets&quot;/&gt; but it has been used most often with [[DocBook]]. In 1997, software engineer Geir Ove Grønmo published a [[syntax highlighting]] language definition for [[KEDIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xml.coverpages.org/dssslKedit0-kld.txt |title=DSSSL.KLD - KEDIT Language Definition for DSSSL Specifications|date=March 1997|first=Geir Ove |last=Grønmo|work=XML Coverpages|publisher=[[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]|accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the appearance of [[XML]] as an alternative to SGML, XML's associated stylesheet language [[XSL]] was also widely and rapidly adopted, from around 1999. Although DSSSL continued to be in use within the shrinking SGML field, XSL was very soon in use more extensively, and by more coders, than DSSSL had ever achieved. This was emphasised when previous SGML strongholds such as [[DocBook]] converted from SGML to XML, and also converted their favoured stylesheet language from DSSSL to XSL.

Sometime in or before 1994, [[Opera Software]] began drafting a &quot;DSSSL Lite&quot; specification for the consideration of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]], since DSSSL was thought to be too complex for the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DSSSL Lite Specification preliminary draft|url=http://people.opera.com/howcome/2006/phd/archive/dsssl-lite.pdf|author=[[Opera Software]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428140616/http://people.opera.com/howcome/2006/phd/archive/dsssl-lite.pdf |archive-date=2016-04-28 |accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ezra Pound by Alvin Langdon Coburn, 1913.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=photograph of Ezra H. Pound|Ezra Pound photographed in 1913 by [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]]]]

'''Ezra Weston Loomis Pound''' (30 October 1885&amp;nbsp;– 1 November 1972) was an [[expatriate]] American poet and critic, a major figure in the early [[modernist poetry]] movement, and a [[Fascism|fascist]] collaborator in Italy during [[World War II]]. His works include ''[[Ripostes]]'' (1912), ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' (1920), and his 800-page [[Epic poetry|epic poem]], ''[[#The Cantos|The Cantos]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1917–1962).&lt;ref&gt;Stoicheff (1995), 6; Beach (2003), 32. The first cantos were published in 1917, and the final complete canto was first published in 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound's contribution to poetry began in the early 20th century with his role in developing [[Imagism]], a movement stressing precision and economy of language. Working in London as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, he helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and [[James Joyce]]. He was responsible for the 1914 serialization of Joyce's ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', the 1915 publication of Eliot's &quot;[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]&quot;, and the serialization from 1918 of Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. Hemingway wrote in 1932 that, for poets born in the late 19th or early 20th century, not to be influenced by Pound would be like passing through a great blizzard and not feeling its cold.{{efn|name=Hemingway1932|On 21 November 1932 Hemingway wrote (&quot;Statement on Ezra Pound&quot;, ''The Cantos of Ezra Pound: Some Testimonies'', New York: Farrar &amp; Rinehart, 1933): &quot;Any poet born in this century or in the last ten years of the preceding century who can honestly say that he has not been influenced by or learned greatly from the work of Ezra Pound deserves to be pitied rather than rebuked. It is as if a prose writer born in that time should not have learned from or been influenced by James Joyce or that a traveller should pass through a great blizzard and not have felt its cold or a sandstorm and not have felt the sand and the wind. The best of Pound's writing—and it is in the CANTOS—will last as long as there is any literature.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hemingway2006pp24–25&gt;Hemingway (2006), 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Angered by the carnage of [[World War I]], Pound blamed the war on [[finance capitalism]], which he called &quot;[[usury]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Preda2005bp90&gt;Preda (2005b), 90&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Italy in 1924 and through the 1930s and 1940s promoted an economic theory known as [[social credit]], wrote for publications owned by the British fascist Sir [[Oswald Mosley]], embraced [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|fascism]], and expressed support for [[Adolf Hitler]]. During World War II and the [[Holocaust in Italy]], he made hundreds of paid [[Ezra Pound's radio broadcasts, 1941–1945|radio broadcasts for the Italian government]], including in [[German-occupied Italy]], attacking the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and, above all, [[Jew]]s, as a result of which he was arrested in 1945 by American forces in Italy on charges of [[treason]]. He spent months in a U.S. military camp in [[Pisa]], including three weeks in an outdoor steel cage. Deemed unfit to stand trial, he was incarcerated in [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|St. Elizabeths]] psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C., for over 12 years.

While in custody in Italy, Pound began work on sections of ''The Cantos'' that were published as ''[[The Pisan Cantos]]'' (1948), for which he was awarded the [[Bollingen Prize|Bollingen Prize for Poetry]] in 1949 by the [[Library of Congress]], causing enormous controversy. After a campaign by his fellow writers, he was released from St. Elizabeths in 1958 and lived in Italy until his death in 1972. His political views have ensured that his life and work remain controversial.

The '''National Information Infrastructure''' ('''NII''') was the product of the [[High Performance Computing Act of 1991]]. It was a [[telecommunication]]s policy [[buzzword]], which was popularized during the [[Clinton Administration]] under the leadership of Vice-President [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpsr.org/prevsite/publications/newsletters/old/1990s/Summer1993.txt/ Summer1993.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

It proposed to build [[telecommunication|communications]] networks, interactive services, interoperable [[computer hardware]] and [[software]], computers, databases, and [[consumer electronics]] in order to put vast amounts of [[information]] available to both public and private sectors.  NII was to have included more than just the physical facilities (more than the cameras, scanners, keyboards, telephones, fax machines, computers, switches, compact disks, [[video]] and audio tape, [[Electrical cable|cable]], wire, satellites, [[optical fiber]] [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] lines, [[microwave]] nets, switches, televisions, monitors, and printers) used to transmit, store, process, and display voice, [[data]], and images; it was also to encompass a wide range of interactive functions, [[User (telecommunications)|user]]-tailored services, and [[multimedia]] databases that were interconnected in a technology-neutral manner that will favor no one industry over any other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm National Information Infrastructure (NII)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses}}
{{refimprove|date=December 2018}}
The '''neper''' (symbol: '''Np''') is a [[logarithmic unit]] for [[ratio]]s of measurements of physical field and power quantities, such as [[gain (electronics)|gain]] and loss of electronic signals. The unit's name is derived from the name of [[John Napier]], the inventor of logarithms. As is the case for the [[decibel]] and bel, the neper is a unit defined in the [[international standard]] [[ISO 80000]]. It is not part of the [[International System of Units]] (SI), but is accepted for use alongside the SI.&lt;ref name=BIPM&gt;Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (2006), [http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf The International System of Units (SI) Brochure, 8th edition], pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Like the [[decibel]], the neper is a unit in a [[logarithmic scale]]. While the bel uses the decadic (base-10) [[logarithm]] to compute ratios, the neper uses the [[natural logarithm]], based on [[Euler's number]] ({{nowrap|[[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']] ≈ 2.71828}}). The value of a ratio in nepers is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
L_{\rm Np} = \ln\frac{x_1}{x_2} = \ln x_1 - \ln x_2. 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; are the values of interest (amplitudes), and {{math|ln}} is the natural logarithm.  When the values are quadratic in the amplitude (e.g. power), they are first linearised by taking the square root before the logarithm is taken, or equivalently the result is halved.{{citation needed|reason=It is clear from references (e.g. BIPM brochure) that this is true for amplitudes.  That there is a convention of referring power-like quantities to field-like quantities with the associated halving to determine a quantity in Np (the reverse of the established convention for dB) is not obvious, and I'm not even convinced that this is the case.  We must not assume from electronic texts that this is so.  We should have an authoritative reference.|date=July 2017}}

In the [[International System of Quantities]], the neper is defined as {{nowrap|1=1 Np = 1}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0026-1394/30/5/010/pdf Thor, A. J. (1994). New International Standards for Quantities and Units. Metrologia, 30(5), 517.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units==
{{main|Level (logarithmic quantity)}}

The neper is defined in terms of ratios of [[power, root-power, and field quantities|field quantities]] — also called ''root-power quantities'' — (for example, [[voltage]] or [[Current (electricity)|current]] amplitudes in electrical circuits, or [[sound pressure|pressure]] in [[acoustics]]), whereas the decibel was originally defined in terms of [[power (physics)|power]] ratios.  A power ratio 10 log ''r'' dB is equivalent to a field-quantity ratio 20 log ''r'' dB, since power in a linear system is proportional to the square ([[Joule's first law|Joule's laws]]) of the amplitude.  Hence the decibel and the neper have a fixed ratio to each other:

:&lt;math&gt;
1\ \text{Np} = 20 \log_{10} e\ \text{dB} \approx \text{8.685889638 dB} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
1\ \mathrm{dB} = \frac{1}{20} \ln(10)\ \mathrm{Np} \approx \text{0.115129255 Np}. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The (voltage) level ratio is

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
L &amp; = 10 \log_{10} \frac{x_1^2}{x_2^2} &amp; \text{dB} \\
  &amp; = 10 \log_{10} {\left(\frac{x_1}{x_2}\right)}^2 &amp; \text{dB} \\
  &amp; = 20 \log_{10} \frac{x_1}{x_2} &amp; \text{dB} \\
  &amp; = \ln \frac{x_1}{x_2} &amp; \text{Np}. \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Like the decibel, the neper is a dimensionless unit. The [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) recognizes both units. Only the neper is [[coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]] with the SI.&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO 80000]]-3:2007 §0.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The neper is a natural linear unit of [[relative difference]], meaning in nepers (logarithmic units) relative differences add rather than multiply. This property is shared with logarithmic units in other bases, such as the bel.

Particular to the neper, however, is that the derived unit of '''centineper''' is [[asymptotically]] equal to percentage difference for very small differences – since the derivative of the natural log (at 1) is 1; this is not shared with other logarithmic units, which introduce a scaling factor due to the derivative not being unity. The centineper can thus be used as a linear replacement for percentage differences.{{citation needed|reason=It is unclear that this is of practical benefit, nor that this is an established practice; we need an authoritative reference.|date=December 2018}} The linear approximation for small percentage differences,
:&lt;math&gt;(1+\delta)(1+\epsilon) = 1 + \delta + \epsilon + \delta\epsilon \approx 1 + \delta + \epsilon,&lt;/math&gt;
is widely used, particularly in finance—see for example the [[Fisher equation]]. However, it is only approximate, with error increasing for large percentage changes. Measured instead in centinepers, these linear approximations can be replaced with exact equalities{{OR|date=December 2018}}, and applicable to any magnitude change, by defining the following centineper quantity for any change &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
D_{\delta} = 100 \ln\frac{(1+\delta) -1}{1} = 100 \ln\delta
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text bytes="1060" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunications]], '''net gain''' is the overall [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of a [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] [[Telecommunication circuit|circuit]]. Net gain is measured by applying a test [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] at an appropriate [[Power (physics)|power]] level at the input [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] of a circuit and measuring the power delivered at the output port. The net gain in [[decibel|dB]] is calculated by taking 10 times the [[common logarithm]] of the ratio of the output power to the input power.

The net gain expressed in dB may be positive or negative.  If the net gain expressed in dB is negative, it is also called the '''net loss'''.  If the net gain is expressed as a ratio, and the ratio is less than unity, a net loss is indicated.

The test signal must be chosen so that its power level is within the usual operating range of the circuit being tested.

      <text bytes="14168" xml:space="preserve">A '''radio net''' is three or more radio stations communicating with each other on a common [[Communication channel|channel]] or [[frequency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mars.af.mil/Portals/59/documents/Regs/AFMARS%20NTM%202016%20RevA.pdf|title=Air Force MARS National Training Manual 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A net is essentially a moderated conference call conducted over two-way radio, typically in half-duplex operating conditions. The use of half-duplex operation requires a very particular set of operating procedures to be followed in order to avoid inefficiencies and chaos.

Nets operate either on schedule or continuously (continuous watch). Nets operating on schedule handle traffic only at definite, prearranged times and in accordance with a prearranged schedule of intercommunication. Nets operating continuously are prepared to handle traffic at any time; they maintain operators on duty at all stations in the net at all times. When practicable, messages relating to schedules will be transmitted by a means of signal communication other than radio.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Field Manual FM 24-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Net operations:
* allow participants to conduct ordered conferences among participants who usually have common [[information]] needs or related functions to perform
* are characterized by adherence to [[standardization|standard]] formats and procedures, and
* are responsive to a common supervisory [[station (telecommunication)|station]], called the ''&quot;[[net control station]]&quot;,'' which permits access to the net and maintains net operational discipline.

== Net manager ==
A net manager is the person who supervises the creation and operation of a net over multiple sessions. This person will specify the format, date, time, participants, and the net control script. The net manager will also choose the Net Control Station for each net, and may occasionally take on that function, especially in smaller organizations.

== Net Control Station ==
Radio nets are like conference calls in that both have a moderator who initiates the group communication, who ensures all participants follow the standard procedures, and who determines and directs when each other station may talk. The moderator in a radio net is called the Net Control Station, formally abbreviated NCS, and has the following duties:&lt;ref name=&quot;:182&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mars.af.mil/Portals/59/documents/Regs/AFMARS%20NTM%202016%20RevA.pdf|title=Air Force MARS National Training Manual 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Establishes the net and closes the net;
* Directs Net activities, such as passing traffic, to maintain optimum efficiency;
* Chooses net frequency, maintains circuit discipline and frequency accuracy;
* Maintains a net log and records participation in the net and movement of messages; (always knows who is on and off net)
* Appoints one or more Alternate Net Control Stations (ANCS);
* Determines whether and when to conduct network continuity checks;
* Determines when full procedure and full call signs may enhance communications;
* Subject to Net Manager guidance, directs a net to be directed or free.
The Net Control Station will, for each net, appoint at least one Alternate Net Control Station, formally abbreviated ANCS (abbreviated NC2 in WWII procedures), who has the following duties:&lt;ref name=&quot;:182&quot; /&gt;
* Assists the NCS to maintain optimum efficiency;
* Assumes NCS duties in event that the NCS develops station problems;
* Assumes NCS duties for a portion of the net, as directed or as needed;
* Serves as a resource for the NCS; echoes transmissions of the NCS if, and only if, directed to do so by the NCS;
* Maintains a duplicate net log

== Structure of the net ==
Nets can be described as always having a net opening and a net closing, with a roll call normally following the net opening, itself followed by regular net business, which may include announcements, official business, and message passing. Military nets will follow a very abbreviated and opaque version of the structure outlined below, but will still have the critical elements of opening, roll call, late check-ins, and closing.

A net should always operate on the same principle as the [[Inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]] used in journalism—the most important communications always come first, followed by content in ever lower levels of priority.
# Net opening
## Identification of the NCS
## Announcement of the regular date, time, and frequency of the net
## Purpose of the net
# Roll call
## A call for stations to check in, oftentimes from a roster of regular stations
## A call for late check-ins (stations on the roster who did not respond to the first check-in period)
## A call for guest stations to check in
# Net business
# Optional conversion to a free net
# Net closing
Each net will typically have a main purpose, which varies according to the organization conducting the net, which occurs during the net business phase. For amateur radio nets, it's typically for the purpose of allowing stations to discuss their recent operating activities (stations worked, antennas built, etc.) or to swap equipment. For [[Military Auxiliary Radio System]] and [[National Traffic System]] nets, net business will involve mainly the passing of formal messages, known as [[Radiogram (message)|radiograms]].

== Two modes of net operation ==
* Directed Net
** A net in which no station other than the net control station can communicate with any other station, except for the transmission of urgent messages, without first obtaining the permission of the net control station.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=iBFG-jvJwRI%3D&amp;portalid=59|title=MCRP 3-40.3B Radio Operator's Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Free net
** A net in which any station may communicate with any other station in the same net without first obtaining permission from the net control station to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

=== Civil Air Patrol nets ===
The [[Civil Air Patrol]] defines a different set of nets:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Type
!Usage
|-
|'''Command and Control (C2) Nets'''
|For conveying messages and information between different locations and levels of command. This is where formal messages are exchanged, so it serves the same purpose as an IARU Traffic net.
|-
|'''Tactical Net'''
|A Tactical Net is established whenever a requirement exists to coordinate the actions of deployed units in a mobile or portable environment. The primary purpose is to support deployed units, and it would generally be conducted from an [[Incident Command Post]]
|-
|'''Liaison Nets'''
|Anytime CAP is involved with other agencies, CAP may be invited to participate on their frequencies or a previously signed agreement may allow the other agencies on CAP frequencies.
|-
|'''Contingency Nets'''
|Communications managers at each level have the authority to initiate stand-by nets, placing CAP radio stations within their span of control on alert to be available for developing conditions that may result in mission activity.
|-
|'''Training Net'''
|Communication managers may establish nets for training purposes, such as to teach radio procedures to novice operators, or new skills and procedures to more advanced operators.
|}

=== Amateur radio nets ===
The [[International Amateur Radio Union]] defines six different types of nets in its IARU Emergency Telecommunications Guide:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaru.org/uploads/1/3/0/7/13073366/emcommguide_1sept2016.pdf|title=IARU Emergency Telecommunications Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Type
!Usage
|-
|'''Traffic net'''
|Handles formal written messages ([[Radiogram (message)|radiograms]])
|-
|'''Resource net'''
|Used for incoming operators to receive assignments, and to be reassigned as needs changed. Can also be used to locate equipment and operators with special skills. More than one resource net may be created in large-scale events if the traffic warrants.
|-
|'''Logistics net'''
|A type of resource net specifically tasked with logistical needs separate from those of the communications teams.
|-
|'''Tactical net'''
|Handle the primary on-site emergency communication.
|-
|'''Information net'''
|Used to disseminate official bulletins, answer general questions, etc.
|-
|'''Health and Welfare (H&amp;W) net'''
|Handle messages among those people impacted by or in the vicinity of a disaster and their friends and family living outside the disaster zone.

|-
|'''[[Skywarn]] net'''
|Used to coordinate Amateur radio weather spotters, exchange weather reports, and coordinate ham radio responses to weather disasters—especially [[tornado]]s.
|-
|'''Club net'''
|A common practice among Amateur radio clubs, where a portion of the club membership meets on a defined frequency, on a defined schedule (often once a week) to conduct official club business, share recent radio operating activity and equipment builds or purchases, etc.
|-
|Hospital net
|Conducts official communications for one or more county Departments of Public Health, to provide back-up and auxiliary communications during a time of crisis.

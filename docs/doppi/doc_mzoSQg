In [[telecommunications]], '''return loss''' is the loss of [[power (physics)|power]] in the [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] returned/reflected by a discontinuity in a [[transmission line]] or [[optical fiber]].  This discontinuity can be a mismatch with the terminating load or with a device inserted in the line.  It is usually expressed as a ratio in [[decibel]]s (dB);

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''RL''(dB) is the return loss in dB, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the incident power and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the reflected power.
Return loss is related to both [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR) and [[reflection coefficient]] (Γ).  Increasing return loss corresponds to lower SWR.  Return loss is a measure of how well devices or lines are matched.  A match is good if the return loss is high.  A high return loss is desirable and results in a lower [[insertion loss]].

Return loss is used in modern practice in preference to SWR because it has better resolution for small values of reflected wave.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;

==Sign==
Properly, loss quantities, when expressed in decibels, should be positive numbers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Except for cases where an active device succeeds in reflecting back more power than was sent into it.  This is the case, for instance, with the [[negative resistance#Amplifiers|tunnel diode amplifier]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, return loss has historically been expressed as a negative number, and this convention is still widely found in the literature.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;Trevor S. Bird, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5162049 &quot;Definition and Misuse of Return Loss&quot;], ''IEEE Antennas &amp; Propagation Magazine'', '''vol.51''', iss.2, pp. 166–167, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct definition of return loss is the difference in dB between the incident power sent towards the Device Under Test (DUT) and the power reflected, resulting in a positive sign:

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;

However taking the ratio of '''reflected''' to '''incident''' power results in a negative sign for return loss;

:&lt;math&gt;RL'(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm r \over P_\mathrm i}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''RL'''(dB) is the negative of ''RL''(dB).
Return loss with a positive sign is identical to the magnitude of Γ when expressed in decibels but of opposite sign.  That is, return loss with a negative sign is more properly called reflection coefficient.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt; The [[S-parameter]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; from [[two-port network]] theory is frequently also called return loss,&lt;ref&gt;Noel G. Barton, Jacques Periaux, &quot;Coupling of fluids, structures, and waves in aeronautics&quot;, proceedings of a French-Australian workshop in Melbourne, Australia, 3–6 December 2001, p. 187, Springer, 2003 {{ISBN|3-540-40222-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but is actually equal to Γ.

Caution is required when discussing increasing or decreasing return loss since these terms strictly have the opposite meaning when return loss is defined as a negative quantity.

==Electrical==
In metallic conductor systems, reflections of a signal traveling down a conductor can occur at a discontinuity or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] mismatch. The ratio of the amplitude of the reflected wave ''V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the amplitude of the incident wave ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is known as the [[reflection coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit \Gamma = {V_\mathrm r \over V_\mathrm i}&lt;/math&gt;

When the source and load impedances are known values, the reflection coefficient is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit \Gamma = { {Z_\mathrm L - Z_\mathrm S} \over {Z_\mathrm L + Z_\mathrm S} }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the impedance toward the [[voltage source|source]] and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the impedance toward the [[Electrical load|load]].

Return loss is the negative of the magnitude of the reflection coefficient in dB. Since power is proportional to the square of the voltage, return loss is given by,

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = -20 \log_{10} \left| \mathit \Gamma \right|&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[vertical direction|vertical]] bars indicate [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]. Thus, a large positive return loss indicates the reflected power is small relative to the incident power, which indicates good impedance match from source to load.

When the actual transmitted (incident) power and the reflected power are known (i.e., through measurements and/or calculations), then the return loss in dB can be calculated as the difference between the incident power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (in absolute [[decibel]] units, e.g., [[dBm]]) and the reflected power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (also in absolute [[decibel]] units),

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = P_\mathrm i(\mathrm{dB}) - P_\mathrm r(\mathrm{dB})\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Optical==
In [[optics]] (particularly in [[optical fiber|fiberoptics]]) a loss that takes place at discontinuities of [[refractive index]], especially at an air-[[glass]] [[wiktionary:interface|interface]] such as a fiber endface. At those interfaces, a fraction of the optical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] is reflected back toward the source.  This reflection phenomenon is also called &quot;'''[[Fresnel reflection]] loss''',&quot; or simply &quot;'''Fresnel loss'''.&quot;

Fiber optic transmission systems use [[laser]]s to transmit signals over optical fiber, and a high optical return loss (ORL) can cause the laser to stop transmitting correctly. The measurement of ORL is becoming more important in the characterization of optical networks as the use of [[wavelength-division multiplexing]] increases.  These systems use lasers that have a lower tolerance for ORL, and introduce elements into the network that are located in close proximity to the laser.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{ORL}(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_\mathrm r&lt;/math&gt; is the reflected power and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_\mathrm i&lt;/math&gt; is the incident, or input, power.

In [[telephony]], '''ringdown''' is a method of [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]] an operator in which [[telephone]] ringing current is sent over the [[telephone line|line]] to operate a lamp or cause the operation of a self-locking [[relay]] known as a ''drop''.

Ringdown is used in manual operation, as distinguished from automatic signaling by [[Dialling (telephony)|dialing]] a number. The signal consists of a continuous or pulsed alternating current (AC) [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] transmitted over the line. It may be used with or without a [[telephone switchboard]].  The term originated in [[telephone magneto|magneto]] telephone signaling in which cranking the magneto generator, either integrated into the telephone set or housed in a connected ringer box,  would not only ''ring'' its bell but also cause a drop to fall ''down'' at the [[telephone exchange]] switchboard, marked with the number of the line to which the magneto telephone instrument was connected.  

The last ringdown telephone exchange in the United States was located at [[Bryant Pond, Maine]], had 400+ subscribers, and converted to dial service in October 1983.

== Ringdown operator ==
In telephone systems where calls from distant automated exchanges arrive for manual subscribers or [[non-dialable point]]s, there often would be a ringdown operator (reachable from the distant operator console by dialling NPA+181) who would manually ring the desired subscriber on a [[party line (telephony)|party line]] or toll station. On some systems, this function was carried out by the [[switchboard operator|inward operator]] (NPA+121). In both cases, this is a telephone operator at the destination who provides assistance solely to other operators on inbound toll calls; the ringdown operator nominally cannot be dialled directly by the subscriber.

==Non-operator use==
[[Image:Jimmy Carter Library and Museum 99.JPG|thumb|Hotline telephone without dial]]
In an application ''not'' involving a telephone operator, a two-point '''automatic ringdown circuit''', or '''ringdown''', has a telephone at each end. When the telephone at one end goes off-hook, the phone at the other end instantly rings. No dialing is involved and therefore telephone sets without dials are sometimes used.

Many ringdown circuits work in both directions. In some cases a circuit is designed to work in one direction only. That is, going off-hook at one end (end A) rings the other (end B). Going off-hook at end B has no effect at end A.

Ringdown features are often part of a [[key telephone system]].  In the [[wire spring relay]] key service units of the [[Bell System]] [[1A2]], a model 216 automatic ringdown was used to operate the circuit. In the 400-series units, a number of different [[Key Telephone Unit|KTU]]s operate (supervise) a ringdown, including the model 415. In other situations, the ringdown is powered and operated by equipment inside the [[telephone exchange]].

In the case of enterprises with a [[private branch exchange]] (PBX) switch, the ringdown can be operated by the PBX key. The switch is programmed to ring a specific extension (the called phone) when a defined extension (the calling phone) goes off-hook. The PBX does not offer dial tone to the calling extension: it only detects [[on-hook]] or [[off-hook]] status.

[[Voice over IP]] [[analog telephone adapter|adapters]] can be networked and configured to provide automatic ringdown by selecting a dial plan which replaces the empty string with a predefined number or [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP address]], dialed immediately. (Some Cisco VoIP phones and analog adapters treat a dial plan of '''(S0 &lt;:1234567890&gt;)''' as a [[hotline]] configuration which dials 1-234-567890 zero seconds after the telephone is taken off-hook, for instance).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10033/products_qanda_item09186a0080a35977.shtml Getting to Know Dial Plans Sequences]: Document ID #108719, Cisco, Dec 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

These circuits are used:

* over high-volume routes where one site calls another very frequently.
:''Example: an information desk and the information desk staff supervisor's desk.''

* where a tamper-proof ability to call from one point to another is needed.
:''Example: a phone used to summon a taxicab to an airport or hotel.''

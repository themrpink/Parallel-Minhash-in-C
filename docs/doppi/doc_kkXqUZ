According to [[Claude Shannon|Shannon's]] [[source coding theorem]], the optimal code length for a symbol is &amp;minus;log''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;P'', where ''b'' is the number of symbols used to make output codes and ''P'' is the probability of the input symbol.

Two of the most common entropy encoding techniques are [[Huffman coding]] and [[arithmetic coding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffman 1952 pp. 1098–1101&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Huffman | first=David | title=A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes | journal=Proceedings of the IRE | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=40 | issue=9 | year=1952 | issn=0096-8390 | doi=10.1109/jrproc.1952.273898 | pages=1098–1101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If the approximate entropy characteristics of a data stream are known in advance (especially for [[signal compression]]), a simpler static code may be useful.
These static codes include [[Universal code (data compression)|universal codes]] (such as [[Elias gamma coding]] or [[Fibonacci coding]]) and [[Golomb coding|Golomb codes]] (such as [[unary coding]] or [[Rice coding]]).

Since 2014, data compressors have started using the [[Asymmetric Numeral Systems]] family of entropy coding techniques, which allows combination of the compression ratio of [[arithmetic coding]] with a processing cost similar to [[Huffman coding]].

== Entropy as a measure of similarity ==

Besides using entropy encoding as a way to compress digital data, an entropy encoder can also be used to measure the amount of [[Similarity measure|similarity]] between [[data stream|streams of data]] and already existing classes of data.  This is done by generating an entropy coder/compressor for each class of data; unknown data is then [[Statistical classification|classified]] by feeding the uncompressed data to each compressor and seeing which compressor yields the highest compression.  The coder with the best compression is probably the coder trained on the data that was most similar to the unknown data.

It lies at the mouth of a deep [[ravine]], at the foot of Monte Cerreto (1,315 metres, 4,314 feet), surrounded by dramatic [[cliff]]s and coastal scenery. The town of Amalfi was the capital of the [[maritime republic]] known as the [[Duchy of Amalfi]], an important trading power in the Mediterranean between 839 and around 1200.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Amalfi was a popular holiday destination for the British [[upper class]] and [[aristocracy]].

Amalfi is the main town of the coast on which it is located, named ''[[Amalfi Coast|Costiera Amalfitana]]'' (Amalfi Coast), and is today an important tourist destination together with other towns on the same coast, such as [[Positano]], [[Ravello]] and others. Amalfi is included in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s.

A [[patron saint]] of Amalfi is [[Saint Andrew]], the [[Apostle]], whose [[relics]] are kept here at [[Amalfi Cathedral]] (Cattedrale di Sant'Andrea/Duomo di Amalfi).

==History==
{{see also|Duchy of Amalfi}}
[[File:View of Amalfi.JPG|thumb|left|View of Amalfi.]] 

Amalfi held importance as a maritime power, trading grain from its neighbours, salt from Sardinia  and slaves from the interior, and even timber, in exchange for the [[gold]] [[dinar]]s minted in [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]], in order to buy the [[Byzantine silk]]s that it resold in the West. Grain-bearing Amalfi traders enjoyed privileged positions in the Islamic ports, [[Fernand Braudel]] notes. The Amalfi tables (''{{Interlanguage link multi|Tavole amalfitane|it}}'') provided a maritime code that was widely used by the Christian port cities. Merchants of Amalfi were using gold coins to purchase land in the 9th century, while most of Italy worked in a [[barter]] economy. In the 8th and 9th century, when Mediterranean trade revived it shared with [[Gaeta]] the Italian trade with the East, while [[Venice]] was in its infancy, and in 848 its fleet went to the assistance of [[Pope Leo IV]] against the [[Saracens]].

An independent republic from the 7th century until 1075, Amalfi extracted itself from Byzantine vassalage in 839&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Kreutz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=P-ucSSZrJ0YC&amp;pg=PA81 Before the Normans – Southern Italy in the Ninth and Tenth Centuries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517104553/https://books.google.com/books?id=P-ucSSZrJ0YC&amp;pg=PA81 |date=17 May 2016 }}'', p.81&lt;/ref&gt; and first elected a duke in 958; it rivalled [[Pisa]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] in its domestic prosperity and maritime importance before the rise of the [[Republic of Venice]]. In spite of some devastating setbacks it had a population of some 70,000 to 80,000 reaching a peak about the turn of the millennium, during the reign of [[Manso I, Duke of Amalfi|Duke Manso]] (966–1004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVUvAczJgsYC&amp;pg=PT910|title=501 Must-Visit Destinations|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426152940/https://books.google.com/books?id=zVUvAczJgsYC&amp;pg=PT910|archive-date=26 April 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cg7JYZO_nEMC&amp;pg=PA161|title=Cities and Economic Development|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722195346/http://books.google.com/books?id=Cg7JYZO_nEMC&amp;pg=PA161|archive-date=22 July 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=PA270|title=Urban World History|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521160721/https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=PA270|archive-date=21 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt; Under his line of dukes, Amalfi remained independent, except for a brief period of [[Salerno|Salernitan]] dependency under [[Guaimar IV of Salerno|Guaimar IV]].

In 1073 the republic fell to the [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] countship of [[Apulia]], but was granted many rights. A prey to the Normans who encamped in the south of Italy, it became one of their principal posts. However, in 1131, it was reduced by King [[Roger II of Sicily]], who had been refused the keys to its citadel. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], fighting in favour of Pope [[Innocent II]] against Roger, who sided with the [[Antipope Anacletus]], took him prisoner in 1133, assisted by forty-six Pisan ships. The Pisans, commercial rivals of the Amalfitani, sacked the city;  Lothair claimed as part of the booty a copy of the [[Pandects of Justinian]] which was found there.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

In 1135 and 1137, it was taken by the [[Pisa]]ns and rapidly declined in importance, though its maritime code, known as the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Tavole amalfitane|it}}'', was recognized in the [[Mediterranean]] until 1570. A [[Earthquake of 1343|tsunami in 1343]] destroyed the port and lower town,&lt;ref&gt;Braudel p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; and Amalfi never recovered to anything more than local importance.

In medieval culture Amalfi was famous for its flourishing schools of law and mathematics. [[Flavio Gioia]], traditionally considered the first to introduce the [[mariner's compass]] to Europe, is said to have been a native of Amalfi.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

Amalfi has a long history of catering for visitors, with two former monasteries being converted to hotels at a relatively early date, the Luna Convento in the second decade of the 19th century and the Cappuccini Convento in the 1880s.  Celebrated visitors to Amalfi included the composer [[Richard Wagner]] and the playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]], both of whom completed works whilst staying in Amalfi. Author [[Gore Vidal]] was a long time resident.

==Main sights==
Amalfi occupied a high position in medieval architecture; its cathedral of Sant'Andrea ([[Saint Andrew]], 11th century), the [[campanile]], the convent of the Cappuccini, founded by the Amalfitan Cardinal [[Pietro Capuano]], richly represent the artistic movement prevailing in Southern Italy at the time of the Normans, with its tendency to blend the Byzantine style with the forms and sharp lines of the northern architecture.&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;{{Catholic|wstitle=Amalfi|inline=1| last =Buonaiuti | first =Ernesto | year =1907 | volume =I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cathedral===
{{Main|Amalfi Cathedral}}
At the top of a staircase, [[Amalfi Cathedral|Saint Andrew's Cathedral]] ([[Duomo]]) overlooks the Piazza Duomo, the heart of Amalfi. The cathedral dates back to the 11th century; its interior is adorned in the [[Rococo|late Baroque]] style with a nave and two aisles divided by 20 columns. The façade of the cathedral is Byzantine in style and is adorned with various paintings of saints, including a large fresco of Saint Andrew.

The gold caisson ceiling has four large paintings by [[Andrea dell'Asta]]. They depict the flagellation of [[Saint Andrew]], the miracle of Manna, the crucifixion of Saint Andrew and the Saint on the cross. From the left hand nave there is a flight of stairs which leads to the crypt. These stairs were built in  1203 for Cardinal [[Pietro Capuano]], who, on 18 May 1208, brought Saint Andrew's remains to the cathedral from [[Constantinople]].

The bronze statue of Saint Andrew in the cathedral was sculpted by [[Michelangelo Naccherino]], a pupil of [[Michelangelo]]; also present are [[Pietro Bernini]] marble sculptures of St. Stephen and  St. Lawrence.

In 1206, [[Saint Andrew]]'s relics were brought to Amalfi from Constantinople by the Pietro Capuano following the [[Sack of Constantinople]] (an event of the [[4th Crusade]]) after the completion of the town's cathedral.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt; The cathedral contains a tomb in its crypt that it maintains still holds a portion of  the [[relic]]s of the [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]]. A golden [[reliquary]] which originally housed his skull and another one used for [[procession]]s through Amalfi on holy days can also be seen.
[[File:Amalfi Piazza del Duomo Italy 3.JPG|thumb|left|View of Piazza del Duomo.]]
===Arsenal of the Maritime Republic (''Gli Arsenali della Repubblica'')===
The structure of the arsenal consists of two large stone-built halls with vaulting supported by repeated pointed arches. The vaulting rests on ten piers, originally there were twenty two, the missing twelve and the structure they supported having been lost to centuries of coastal erosion.  The main function of the arsenal was  the building, repair and storage of warships.  Amalfitan war-galleys were among the largest to be found in the Mediterranean during the Early Middle Ages.  The building now contains architectural and sculptural remains, a row-barge used in the Historical Regatta, a number of models of ships and it also acts as a venue for visual art exhibitions. Starting from December 2010, the Ancient Arsenals of Amalfi host the Compass Museum on the premises of the two aisles of the building, which were spared by the Amalfi seaquake of 1343.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://amalfi-coast.com/amalfi-ancient-arsenals|title= The Ancient Arsenals of Amalfi|accessdate= 25 January 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120109060637/http://amalfi-coast.com/amalfi-ancient-arsenals|archive-date= 9 January 2012|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum of Handmade Paper (''Museo della Carta'')===

The Museum of Handmade Paper, located in Mill Valley in the northern part of the modern town, celebrates the long-established paper making tradition in Amalfi. The town was one of the first centres of paper making in Europe, the skill having been acquired by the Amalfitans from the Arabs. The museum is housed in an ancient paper mill which was once owned by the Milano family, a family famous in Amalfi for its involvement in the production and manufacture of paper. In 1969 the building was converted into a museum  as a result of the will of Nicholas Milano, the mill's then owner. The museum contains the machinery and equipment (restored and fully functional) that was once used to manufacture paper by hand.

==Culture==
The Amalfi coast is famed for its production of [[Limoncello]] liqueur and the area is a known cultivator of [[lemon]]s. The correct name is &quot;sfusato amalfitano&quot;, and they are typically long and at least double the size of other lemons, with a thick and wrinkled skin and a sweet and juicy flesh without many pips. It is common to see lemons growing in the terraced gardens along the entire Amalfi coast between February and October. Amalfi is also a known maker of a hand-made thick paper which is called &quot;[[bambagina]]&quot;. It is exported to many European countries and to America and has been used throughout Italy for wedding invitations, visiting cards and elegant writing paper. The paper has a high quality and has been used by artists such as [[Giuseppe Leone]], who described it: &quot;There is a whole world that the Amalfi paper evokes and an artist who is sensitive to the suggestion of these places is aware that it is unique and exciting&quot;.

Three traditional events draw numerous visitors to Amalfi. First are the [[feast day]]s of [[Saint Andrew]] (25–27 June, and 30 November), celebrating the city's [[patron saint]]. Then there is &quot;Byzantine New Year's Eve&quot; (31 August) celebrating the beginning of the New Year according to the old civil calendar of the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] continues to celebrate the beginning of the [[liturgical year]] on 1 September, a date chosen because of its proximity to the [[Jewish New Year]].&lt;/ref&gt; The third event is the Historical [[Regatta]] (first Sunday in June), a traditional rowing competition among the four best known Italian historical [[maritime republics]]: Amalfi, [[history of Genoa|Genoa]], [[history of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[History of the Republic of Venice|Venice]]. This event is hosted by a different city every year, so it comes to Amalfi once every four years.

'''Anne''' (6 February 1665 – 1 August 1714){{efn|All dates in this article are in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] [[Julian calendar]] used in Great Britain throughout Anne's lifetime, except that years are assumed to start on 1 January rather than 25 March, which was the English New Year.}} was [[List of English monarchs|Queen of England]], [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scotland]] and [[List of Irish monarchs|Ireland]] between 8 March 1702 and 1 May 1707. On 1 May 1707, under the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] united as a single [[sovereign state]] known as [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. She continued to reign as [[List of British monarchs|Queen of Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] until her death in 1714.

Anne was born in the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to his younger brother and [[heir presumptive]], [[James II of England|James]], whose suspected [[Roman Catholicism]] was unpopular in England. On Charles's instructions, Anne and her elder sister, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], were raised as [[Anglicans]]. Mary married their Dutch [[Protestant]] cousin, [[William III of Orange]], in 1677, and Anne married [[Prince George of Denmark]] in 1683. On Charles's death in 1685, James succeeded to the throne, but just three years later he was deposed in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. Mary and William became joint monarchs. Although the sisters had been close, disagreements over Anne's finances, status, and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary's accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary's death in 1694, William reigned alone until his own death in 1702, when Anne succeeded him.

During her reign, Anne favoured moderate [[Tories (British political party)|Tory politicians]], who were more likely to share her Anglican religious views than their opponents, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]]. The Whigs grew more powerful during the course of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], until 1710 when Anne dismissed many of them from office. Her close friendship with [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]], turned sour as the result of political differences. The Duchess took revenge with an unflattering description of the Queen in her memoirs, which was widely accepted by historians until Anne was re-assessed in the late 20th century.

Anne was plagued by ill health throughout her life, and from her thirties, she grew increasingly ill and obese. Despite seventeen pregnancies she died without surviving issue and was the last monarch of the [[House of Stuart]]. Under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded all Catholics, she was succeeded by her second cousin [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] of the [[House of Hanover]].

Anne was born at 11:39&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 6 February 1665 at [[St James's Palace]], London, the fourth child and second daughter of the Duke of York (afterwards [[James II and VII]]), and his first wife, [[Anne Hyde]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 12–17; Gregg, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was the younger brother of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], who ruled the three kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], and her mother was the daughter of [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]]. At her [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] baptism in the [[Chapel Royal]] at St James's, her older sister, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], was one of her godparents, along with the [[Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch|Duchess of Monmouth]] and the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Gilbert Sheldon]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke and Duchess of York had eight children, but Anne and Mary were the only ones to survive into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 17; Gregg, p. 6; Waller, pp. 293–295&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Anne suffered from an eye condition, which manifested as excessive watering known as &quot;defluxion&quot;. For medical treatment, she was sent to France, where she lived with her paternal grandmother, [[Henrietta Maria of France]], at the Château de Colombes near Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 19–21; Green, p. 20; Gregg, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Following her grandmother's death in 1669, Anne lived with an aunt, [[Henrietta Anne, Duchess of Orléans]]. On the sudden death of her aunt in 1670, Anne returned to England. Her mother died the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 21–23; Gregg, p. 8; Somerset, pp. 11–13; Waller, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

As was traditional in the royal family, Anne and her sister were brought up separated from their father in their own establishment at [[Richmond, London]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; On the instructions of Charles II, they were raised as Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 23–24; Gregg, p. 13; Somerset, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Placed in the care of Colonel [[Edward Villiers (1620–1689)|Edward and Lady Frances Villiers]],&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 21; Gregg, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; their education was focused on the teachings of the Anglican church.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 28; Gregg, p. 13; Waller, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]], [[Bishop of London]], was appointed as Anne's [[preceptor]].&lt;ref&gt;Somerset, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1671, Anne first made the acquaintance of [[Sarah Jennings]], who later became her close friend and one of her most influential advisors.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 27; Green, p. 21; Gregg, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Jennings married [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill]] (the future Duke of Marlborough) in about 1678. His sister, [[Arabella Churchill (royal mistress)|Arabella Churchill]], was the Duke of York's mistress, and he was to be Anne's most important general.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 34; Green, p. 29; Gregg, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1673, the Duke of York's conversion to Catholicism became public, and he married a Catholic princess, [[Mary of Modena]], who was only six and a half years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so the Duke of York was next in the line of succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess of York had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, pp. 260–261&lt;/ref&gt; There is every indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on well together,&lt;ref&gt;Somerset, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; and the Duke of York was a conscientious and loving father.&lt;ref&gt;Somerset, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1677, Anne's elder sister, Mary, married their Dutch first cousin, [[William III of Orange]], at St James's Palace, but Anne could not attend the wedding because she was confined to her room with [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 30; Green, p. 27; Gregg, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; By the time she recovered, Mary had already left for her new life in the Netherlands. Lady Frances Villiers contracted the disease, and died. Anne's aunt [[Henrietta Hyde, Countess of Rochester|Lady Henrietta Hyde]] (the wife of [[Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester|Laurence Hyde]]) was appointed as her new governess.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 28; Gregg, p. 17; Somerset, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Anne and her stepmother visited Mary in Holland for two weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;visits&quot; /&gt;

Anne's father and stepmother retired to Brussels in March 1679 in the wake of anti-Catholic hysteria fed by the [[Popish Plot]], and Anne visited them from the end of August.&lt;ref name=&quot;visits&quot;&gt;Green, p. 28: Gregg, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In October, they returned to Britain, the Duke and Duchess to Scotland and Anne to England.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 29; Gregg, p. 22; Somerset, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; She joined her father and stepmother at [[Holyrood Palace]] in [[Edinburgh]] from July 1681 until May 1682.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 32; Gregg, p. 26; Somerset, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; It was her last journey outside England.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne's second cousin [[George I of Great Britain|George of Hanover]] visited London for three months from December 1680, sparking rumours of a potential marriage between them.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 35–37; Green, p. 31; Gregg, p. 24; Somerset, pp. 34, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Edward Gregg dismissed the rumours as ungrounded, as her father was essentially exiled from court, and the Hanoverians planned to marry George to his first cousin [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle]] as part of a scheme to unite the Hanoverian inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Other rumours claimed she was courted by [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Lord Mulgrave]], although he denied it. Nevertheless, as a result of the gossip, he was temporarily dismissed from court.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 37; Green, pp. 32–33; Gregg, p. 27; Somerset, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

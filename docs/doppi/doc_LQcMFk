==== 1st century BC ====
The Dacia of King [[Burebista]] (82–44 BC), stretched from the [[Black Sea]] to the source of the river Tisa and from the [[Balkan Mountains]] to [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Romania – Antiquity – The Dacians |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/508461/Romania/214504/History#ref=ref476941}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, the Geto-Dacians conquered a wider territory and Dacia extended from the Middle Danube to the Black Sea littoral (between Apollonia and Olbia) and from present-day Slovakia's mountains to the Balkan mountains.{{sfn|Murray|2001|p=1120}} In 53 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] stated that the lands of the Dacians started on the eastern edge of the Hercynian Forest (Black Forest).{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}} After Burebista's death, his kingdom split in four states, later five.

==== 1st century AD ====
Strabo, in his Geography written around AD 20, says:&lt;ref name=Strabo1&gt;Strabo, ''Geography''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;″As for the southern part of Germany beyond the Albis, the portion which is just contiguous to that river is occupied by the Suevi; then immediately adjoining this is the land of the Getae, which, though narrow at first, stretching as it does along the Ister on its southern side and on the opposite side along the mountain-side of the Hercynian Forest (for the land of the Getae also embraces a part of the mountains), afterwards broadens out towards the north as far as the Tyregetae; but I cannot tell the precise boundaries″&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On this basis, Lengyel and Radan (1980), Hoddinott (1981) and Mountain (1998) consider that the Geto-Dacians inhabited both sides of the [[Tisza]] river prior to the rise of the Celtic [[Boii]], and again after the latter were defeated by the Dacians.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=215}}&lt;!-- STRABO IS A PRIMARY SOURCE: {{sfn | Strabo | VII.3.1 |ps=: As for the southern part of Germany beyond the Albis, the portion which is just contiguous to that river is occupied by the Suevi; then immediately adjoining this is the land of the Getae, which, though narrow at first, stretching as it does along the Ister on its southern side and on the opposite side along the mountain-side of the Hercynian Forest (for the land of the Getae also embraces a part of the mountains), afterwards broadens out towards the north as far as the Tyregetae; but I cannot tell the precise boundaries.}}&lt;ref&gt;Strabo (20 AD) v. 1.6; vii 1.3; vii 5.2&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; The hold of the Dacians between the Danube and Tisza was tenuous.{{sfn|Lengyel|Radan|1980|p=87|ps=: &quot;No matter where the Boii first settled after they left Italia, however, when they arrived at the Danube they had to fight the Dacians who held the entire territory — or at least part of it. Strabo tells us that later animosity between the Dacians and the Boii stemmed from the fact that the Dacians demanded the land from the latter which the Dacians pretended to have possessed earlier.&quot;}} However, the archaeologist Parducz argued a Dacian presence west of the Tisa dating from the time of Burebista.{{sfn|Ehrich|1970|p=228}} According to [[Tacitus]] (AD 56 – AD 117) Dacians bordered Germania in the south-east, while Sarmatians bordered it in the east.{{sfn|Gruen|2011|p=204|ps=: Germany as a whole is separated from the Gauls and from the Raetians and Pannonians by the rivers Rhine and Danube, from the Sarmatians and Dacians by mutual fear or mountains; the ocean surrounds the rest of it}}

In the 1st century AD, the [[Iazyges]] settled West of Dacia, on the plain between the Danube and the Tisa rivers, according to the scholars' interpretation of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s text: &quot;The higher parts between the Danube and the Hercynian Forest (Black Forest) as far as the winter quarters of Pannonia at Carnutum and the plains and level country of the German frontiers there are occupied by the Sarmatian Iazyges, while the Dacians whom they have driven out hold the mountains and forests as far as the river Theiss&quot;.{{sfn|Hrushevskyi|1997|p=93}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1980|p=60}}&lt;!-- PLINY IS A PRIMARY SOURCE: {{sfn|Pliny's Natural History|2000|p=179}} --&gt;{{sfn|Carnap-Bornheim|2003|p=228}}{{sfn|Scott Shelley|1997|p=10}}

==== 2nd century AD ====
{{Main|Trajan's Dacian Wars|Roman Dacia}}

Written a few decades after Emperor [[Trajan]]'s Roman conquest of parts of Dacia in AD 105–106,{{sfn|Mattern|2002|p=61}} Ptolemy's ''[[Geographia]]'' included the boundaries of Dacia. According to the scholars' interpretation of Ptolemy (Hrushevskyi 1997, Bunbury 1879, Mocsy 1974, Barbulescu and Nagler 2005) Dacia was the region between the rivers [[Tisza]], Danube, upper Dniester, and Siret.{{sfn|Hrushevskyi|1997|p=97|ps=: &quot;Dacia, as described by Ptolemy, occupied the region between the Tisa, Danube, upper Dnister, and Seret, while the Black Sea coast — namely, the Greek colonies of Tyras, Olbia, and others — were included in Lower Moesia.&quot;}}{{sfn|Bunbury|1979|p=517}}{{sfn |Mocsy|1974|p=21}}{{sfn|Barbulescu|Nägler|2005|p=71}} Mainstream historians accept this interpretation: Avery (1972) Berenger (1994) Fol (1996) Mountain (1998), Waldman Mason (2006).{{sfn|Berenger|1994|p=25}}{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}}{{sfn |Waldman|Mason|2006|p=205}}{{sfn|Avery|1972|p=113}}{{sfn|Fol|1996|p=223}}

Ptolemy also provided a couple of Dacian [[toponyms]] in south Poland in the Upper [[Vistula]] (Polish: Wisla) river basin: [[Susudava]] and [[Setidava]] (with a manuscript variant [[Getidava]]).{{sfn|Dobiás|1964|p=70}}{{sfn|Berindei|Candea|2001|p=429}}{{sfn|Shutte|1952|p=270}}{{sfn|Giurescu C|Giurescu D |1974|p=31}} This could have been an &quot;echo&quot; of Burebista's expansion.{{sfn|Berindei|Candea|2001|p=429}} It seems that this northern expansion of the Dacian language, as far as the [[Vistula]] river, lasted until AD 170–180 when the migration of the Vandal [[Hasdingi]] pushed out this northern Dacian group.{{sfn|Gordon Childe|1930|p=245}}{{sfn|Shutte|1917|p=109 &amp; 143}} This Dacian group, possibly the [[Costoboci]]/[[Lipiţa culture]], is associated by [[Gudmund Schütte]] with towns having the specific Dacian language ending &quot;[[Dava (Dacia)|dava]]&quot; i.e. [[Setidava]].{{sfn|Shutte|1952|p=270}}

The [[Roman province]] ''Dacia Traiana'', established by the victors of the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]] during AD 101–106, initially comprised only the regions known today as [[Banat]], [[Oltenia]], [[Transylvania]], and was subsequently gradually extended to southern parts of [[Moldavia]], while [[Dobruja]] and [[Budjak]] belonged the Roman province of [[Moesia]].

In the 2nd century AD, after the Roman conquest, [[Ptolemy]] puts the eastern boundary of ''[[Dacia Traiana]]'' (the Roman province) as far east as the ''Hierasus'' ([[Siret River|Siret]]) river, in the middle of modern [[Romania]]. Roman rule extended to the south-western area of the Dacian Kingdom (but not to what later became known as [[Maramureş]]), to parts of the later [[Principality of Moldavia]] east of the Siret and north of the [[Upper Trajan Wall]], and to areas in modern [[Muntenia]] and Ukraine, except the Black Sea shore.

After the [[Marcomannic Wars]] (AD 166–180), Dacian groups from outside Roman Dacia had been set in motion. So were the 12,000 Dacians 'from the neighbourhood of Roman Dacia sent away from their own country'. Their native country could have been the Upper Tisa region, but other places cannot be excluded.{{sfn|Opreanu|1997|p=249}}

The later Roman province ''[[Dacia Aureliana]]'', was organized inside former [[Moesia Superior]] after the retreat of the Roman army from Dacia, during the reign of emperor [[Aurelian]] during AD 271–275. It was reorganized as [[Dacia Ripensis]] (as a military province) and [[Dacia Mediterranea]] (as a civil province).{{sfn|Odahl|2003}}

=== Cities ===
{{Main|Davae|List of Dacian towns}}

Ptolemy gives a list of 43 names of towns in Dacia, out of which arguably 33 were of Dacian origin. Most of the latter included the added suffix ‘dava’ (meaning settlement, village). But, other Dacian names from his list lack the suffix (e.g. Zarmisegethusa regia = Zermizirga) In addition, nine other names of Dacian origin seem to have been Latinised.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=114}}

The cities of the Dacians were known as ''-dava'', ''-deva'', -δαυα (&quot;-dawa&quot; or &quot;-dava&quot;, [[Ancient Greek|Anc. Gk.]]), -δεβα (&quot;-deva&quot;, [[Byzantine Greek|Byz. Gk.]]) or -δαβα (&quot;-dava&quot;, [[Byzantine Greek|Byz. Gk.]]), etc. .

#In Dacia: ''[[Acidava]]'', ''[[Argedava]]'', ''[[Buridava]]'', ''Dokidava'', ''Carsidava'', ''Clepidava'', ''[[Cumidava]]'', ''Marcodava'', ''Netindava'', ''Patridava'', ''[[Craiova|Pelendava]]'', ''*Perburidava'', ''Petrodaua'', ''Piroboridaua'', ''Rhamidaua'', ''Rusidava'', ''Sacidava'', ''Sangidava'', ''Setidava'', ''Singidava'', ''Tamasidava'', ''Utidava'', ''Zargidava'', ''[[Ziridava]]'', ''Sucidava''—26 names altogether.
# In Lower Moesia (the present Northern [[Bulgaria]]) and Scythia minor ([[Dobrudja]]): ''[[Aedeba]]'', ''*Buteridava'', ''*Giridava'', ''Dausadava'', ''Kapidaua'', ''Murideba'', ''Sacidava'', ''Scaidava'' (''Skedeba''), ''Sagadava'', ''Sukidaua'' (''Sucidava'')—10 names in total.
#In Upper Moesia (the districts of Nish, Sofia, and partly Kjustendil): ''[[Aiadaba]]'', ''Bregedaba'', ''Danedebai'', ''Desudaba'', ''Itadeba'', ''Kuimedaba'', ''Zisnudeba''—seven names in total.

''Gil-doba'', a village in [[Thracia]], of unknown location.

''Thermi-daua'', a town in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. Probably a Grecized form of ''*Germidava''.

''Pulpu-deva'', (Phillipopolis) today [[Plovdiv]] in [[Bulgaria]].

== Political entities ==

=== Rubobostes ===
{{Main|Rubobostes}}

Geto-Dacians inhabited both sides of the Tisa river prior to the rise of the Celtic [[Boii]] and again after the latter were defeated by the Dacians under the king Burebista.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=215}} It seems likely that the Dacian state arose as a tribal confederacy, which was united only by charismatic leadership in both military-political and ideological-religious domains.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=215}} At the beginning of the 2nd century BC, under the rule of [[Rubobostes]], a Dacian king in present-day [[Transylvania]], the Dacians' power in the [[Carpathian basin]] increased after they defeated the [[Celts]], who previously held power in the region.

=== Oroles ===
{{Main|Oroles}}

A kingdom of Dacia also existed as early as the first half of the 2nd century BC under King [[Oroles]]. Conflicts with the [[Bastarnae]] and the Romans (112–109 BC, 74 BC), against whom they had assisted the [[Scordisci]] and [[Dardani]], greatly weakened the resources of the Dacians.

=== Burebista ===
{{Main|Burebista}}

[[Burebista]] (Boerebista), a contemporary of [[Julius Caesar]], ruled Geto-Dacian tribes between 82 BC and 44 BC. He thoroughly reorganised the army and attempted to raise the moral standard and obedience of the people by persuading them to cut their vines and give up drinking wine.&lt;ref name=&quot;StraboVII.3.11&quot;&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'', VII:3.11&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, the limits of the Dacian Kingdom were extended to their maximum. The [[Bastarnae]] and [[Boii]] were conquered, and even the Greek towns of [[Olbia]] and [[Apollonia, Thrace|Apollonia]] on the [[Black Sea]] (''Pontus Euxinus'') recognized [[Burebista]]'s authority. In 53 BC, Caesar stated that the Dacian territory was on the eastern border of the [[Hercynian Forest]].{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}}

Burebista suppressed the indigenous minting of coinages by four major tribal groups, adopting imported or copied Roman denarii as a monetary standard{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=215}} During his reign, Burebista transferred Geto-Dacians capital from [[Argedava]] to [[Sarmizegetusa Regia]].{{sfn|MacKendrick|1975|p=48}}{{sfn|Goodman|Sherwood|2002|p=227}} For at least one and a half centuries, Sarmizegetusa was the Dacians' capital and reached its peak under King [[Decebalus]]. The Dacians appeared so formidable that Caesar contemplated an expedition against them, which his death in 44 BC prevented. In the same year Burebista was murdered, and the kingdom was divided into four (later five) parts under separate rulers.

=== Cotiso ===
{{Main|Cotiso}}

One of these entities was [[Cotiso]]'s state, to whom Augustus betrothed his own five-year-old daughter Julia. He is well known from the line in [[Horace]] (''Occidit Daci Cotisonis agmen'', Odes, III. 8. 18).

The Dacians are often mentioned under Augustus, according to whom they were compelled to recognize Roman supremacy. However they were by no means subdued, and in later times to maintain their independence they seized every opportunity to cross the frozen Danube during the winter and ravaging the Roman cities in the province of [[Moesia]], which was under Roman occupation.

Strabo testified: &quot;although the Getae and Daci once attained to very great power, so that they actually could send forth an expedition of two hundred thousand men, they now find themselves reduced to as few as forty thousand, and they have come close to the point of yielding obedience to the Romans, though as yet they are not absolutely submissive, because of the hopes which they base on the Germans, who are enemies to the Romans.&quot;&lt;ref name=Strabo1/&gt;

In fact, this occurred because [[Burebista]]'s empire split after his death into four and later five smaller states, as Strabo explains, &quot;only recently, when [[Augustus Caesar]] sent an expedition against them, the number of parts into which the empire had been divided was five, though at the time of the insurrection it had been four. Such divisions, to be sure, are only temporary and vary with the times&quot;.

=== Decebalus ===
{{Main|Decebalus}}

Decebalus ruled the Dacians between AD 87 and 106. The frontiers of Decebal's Dacia were marked by the Tisa River to the west, by the trans-Carpathians to the north and by the Dniester River to the east.{{sfn|Vico|Pinton|2001|p=325}} His name translates into &quot;''strong as ten men''&quot;.

When [[Trajan]] turned his attention to Dacia, it had been on the Roman agenda since before the days of [[Julius Caesar]]{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2004|p=322}}{{sfn|Matyszak|2004|p=213}} when a Roman army had been beaten at the [[Battle of Histria]].{{sfn|Matyszak|2004|p=215}}

From AD 85 to 89, the Dacians under [[Decebalus]] were engaged in two wars with the Romans.

|quote= Battle of Sarmizegetusa (Sarmizegetuza), AD 105. During Trajan's reign Rome achieved victory over the Dacians. The first important confrontation between the Romans and the Dacians took place in the year AD 87 and was initiated by Domitian. The [[praetorian prefect]] [[Cornelius Fuscus|Cornelius]] led five or six legions across the Danube on a bridge of ships and advanced towards [[Banat]] (in Romania). The Romans were surprised by a Dacian attack at Tapae (near the village of [[Bucova]], in Romania). Legion V Alaude was crushed and Cornelius Fuscus was killed. The victorious general was originally known as [[Diurpaneus]] (see Manea, p.109), but after this victory he was called Decebalus (the brave one).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, AD 88, new Roman troops under [[Tettius Julianus]], gained a significant advantage, but were obligated to make peace following the defeat of [[Domitian]] by the [[Marcomanni]], leaving the Dacians effectively independent. Decebalus was given the status of &quot;king client to Rome&quot;, receiving military instructors, craftsmen and money from Rome.

To increase the glory of his reign, restore the finances of Rome, and end a treaty perceived as humiliating, Trajan resolved on the conquest of Dacia, the capture of the famous Treasure of Decebalus, and control over the Dacian gold mines of [[Transylvania]]. The result of his first campaign (101–102) was the siege of the Dacian capital Sarmizegethusa and the occupation of part of the country. Emperor Trajan recommenced hostilities against Dacia and, following an uncertain number of battles,{{sfn|Matyszak|2004|p=219}} and with Trajan's troops pressing towards the Dacian capital [[Sarmizegethusa]], Decebalus once more sought terms.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2004|p=329}}

[[File:Roman province of Dacia (106 - 271 AD).svg|300px|thumb|left|[[Roman Dacia]] and [[Moesia Inferior]].]]
Decebalus rebuilt his power over the following years and attacked Roman garrisons again in AD 105. In response Trajan again marched into Dacia,{{sfn|Matyszak|2004|p=222}} attacking the Dacian capital in the [[Siege of Sarmizegethusa]], and razing it to the ground;{{sfn|Matyszak|2004|p=223}} the defeated Dacian king [[Decebalus]] committed suicide to avoid capture.{{sfn|Luttwak|1976|p=54}} With part of Dacia quelled as the [[Roman province]] [[Roman Dacia|Dacia Traiana]].{{sfn|Stoica|1919|p=52}} Trajan subsequently [[Trajan's Parthian War|invaded the Parthian empire]] to the east. His conquests brought the Roman Empire to its greatest extent. Rome's borders in the east were governed indirectly in this period, through a system of [[client states]], which led to less direct campaigning than in the west.{{sfn|Luttwak|1976|p=39}}

The history of the war is given by [[Cassius Dio]], but the best commentary upon it is the famous [[Trajan's Column|Column of Trajan]] in [[Rome]].

===Provincial history===
[[File:Roman provinces of Illyricum, Macedonia, Dacia, Moesia, Pannonia and Thracia.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Dacia and environs]]
Although the Romans conquered and destroyed the ancient Kingdom of Dacia, a large remainder of the land remained outside of Roman Imperial authority. Additionally, the conquest changed the balance of power in the region and was the catalyst for a renewed alliance of Germanic and Celtic tribes and kingdoms against the Roman Empire. However, the material advantages of the Roman Imperial system was attractive to the surviving aristocracy. Afterwards, many of the Dacians became Romanised (see also [[Origin of Romanians]]). In AD 183, war broke out in Dacia: few details are available, but it appears two future contenders for the throne of emperor [[Commodus]], [[Clodius Albinus]] and [[Pescennius Niger]], both distinguished themselves in the campaign.

According to [[Lactantius]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Of the Manner in which the persecutors died&quot; by [[Lactantius]] (early Christian author AD 240–320)&lt;/ref&gt; the Roman emperor [[Decius]] (AD 249–251) had to restore Roman Dacia from the [[Carpo-Dacians]] of [[Zosimus]] &quot;having undertaken an expedition against the Carpi, who had then possessed themselves of Dacia and Moesia&quot;.

[[File:Rome-JA1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Tarabostes on the [[Arch of Constantine]]]]
Even so, the Germanic and Celtic kingdoms, particularly the [[Gothic tribes]], slowly moved toward the Dacian borders, and within a generation were making assaults on the province. Ultimately, the [[Goths]] succeeded in dislodging the Romans and restoring the &quot;independence&quot; of Dacia following Emperor [[Aurelian]]'s withdrawal, in 275.

In AD 268–269, at [[Naissus]], [[Claudius II]] (Gothicus Maximus) obtained a decisive victory over the Goths. Since at that time Romans were still occupying [[Roman Dacia]] it is assumed that the Goths didn't cross the Danube from the Roman province. The Goths who survived their defeat didn't even attempt to escape through Dacia, but through [[Thrace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Battle of Naissus]] and [[Cladius Gothicus]]. Beside Zosimuss account there is also Historia Augusta, The Life of Claudius.&lt;/ref&gt; At the boundaries of [[Roman Dacia]], [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]] ([[Free Dacians]]) were still strong enough to sustain five battles in eight years against the Romans from AD 301–308. Roman Dacia was left in AD 275 by the Romans, to the Carpi again, and not to the Goths. There were still Dacians in AD 336, against whom [[Constantine the Great]] fought.

The province was abandoned by Roman troops, and, according to the ''Breviarium historiae Romanae'' by [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], Roman citizens &quot;from the towns and lands of Dacia&quot; were resettled to the interior of Moesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/p/pearse/morefathers/eutropius_breviarium_2_text.htm|title=Eutropius, Abridgment of Roman History (Historiae Romanae Breviarium)|last=EUTROPIUS|website=www.ccel.org|access-date=2008-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220200338/http://www.ccel.org/p/pearse/morefathers/eutropius_breviarium_2_text.htm|archive-date=2009-02-20|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Diocletian]], c.

== Dacia after the Romans ==
{{Main|Romania in the Early Middle Ages}}
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2013}}
[[Victohali]], [[Taifals]] and [[Tervingi|Thervingians]] are tribes mentioned for inhabiting Dacia in 350, after the Romans left. Archeological evidence suggests that [[Gepids]] were disputing [[Transylvania]] with Taifals and Tervingians. Taifals, once independent from Gothia became federati of the Romans, from whom they obtained the right to settle [[Oltenia]].

In 376 the region was conquered by [[Huns]], who kept it until the death of Attila in 453. The Gepid tribe, ruled by [[Ardaric]], used it as their base, until in 566 it was destroyed by [[Lombards]]. Lombards abandoned the country and the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] (second half of the 6th century) dominated the region for 230 years, until their kingdom was destroyed by [[Charlemagne]] in 791. At the same time [[Slavic people]] arrived.

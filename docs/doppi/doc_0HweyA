{{main|French Dahomey}}
Dahomey was a French colony of and a part of French West Africa from 1904 to 1959. Under the French, a port was constructed at [[Cotonou]], and railroads were built. School facilities were expanded by [[Roman Catholic]] missions. In 1946, Dahomey became an overseas territory with its own [[parliament]] and representation in the French national assembly.  On December 4, 1958, it became the [[Republic of Dahomey]].
Between 1960 and 1972, a succession of military coups brought about many changes of government.  The last of these brought to power Major Mathieu Kérékou as the head of a regime professing strict Marxist-Leninist principles. By 1975 the Republic of Dahomey changed its name to the People's Republic of Benin.The People's Revolutionary Party of Benin remained in complete power until the beginning of the 1990s. Kérékou, encouraged by France and other democratic powers, convened a national conference that introduced a new democratic constitution and held presidential and legislative elections. Kérékou's principal opponent at the presidential poll, and the ultimate victor, was Prime Minister Nicéphore Soglo. Supporters of Soglo also secured a majority in the National Assembly Benin was thus the first African country to effect successfully the transition from dictatorship to a pluralistic political system

Kérékou, encouraged by France and other democratic powers, convened a national conference that introduced a new democratic constitution and held presidential and legislative elections. Kérékou's principal opponent at the presidential poll, and the ultimate victor, was Prime Minister [[Nicéphore Soglo]]. Supporters of Soglo also secured a majority in the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=bn&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6761.htm &quot;Background Note: Benin&quot;].

Countries of the world and their leaders yearbook 2007, Volume 1. Thomson Gale, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7876-8104-0}}, p212&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second round of National Assembly elections held in March 1995, Zoglo's political vehicle, the Parti de la Renaissance du Benin, was the largest single party but lacked an overall majority. The success of a party formed by supporters of ex-president Kérékou, who had officially retired from active politics, allowed him to stand successfully at both the 1996 and 2001 presidential elections.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

During the 2001 elections, however, alleged irregularities and dubious practices led to a boycott of the run-off poll by the main opposition candidates. The four top-ranking contenders following the first round presidential elections were Mathieu Kérékou (incumbent) 45.4%, Nicephore Soglo (former president) 27.1%, [[Adrien Houngbédji]] (National Assembly Speaker) 12.6%, and [[Bruno Amoussou]] (Minister of State) 8.6%. The second round balloting, originally scheduled for March 18, 2001, was postponed for days because both Soglo and Houngbedji withdrew, alleging electoral fraud. This left Kérékou to run against his own Minister of State, Amoussou, in what was termed a &quot;friendly match.&quot;&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

In December 2002, Benin held its first municipal elections since before the institution of Marxism-Leninism. The process was smooth with the significant exception of the 12th district council for Cotonou, the contest that would ultimately determine who would be selected for the mayoralty of the capital city. That vote was marred by irregularities, and the electoral commission was forced to repeat that single election. Nicephore Soglo's [[Benin Rebirth Party|Renaissance du Benin]] (RB) party won the new vote, paving the way for the former president to be elected Mayor of Cotonou by the new city council in February 2002.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

National Assembly elections took place in March 2003 and were generally considered to be free and fair. Although there were some irregularities, these were not significant and did not greatly disrupt the proceedings or the results. These elections resulted in a loss of seats by RB—the primary opposition party. The other opposition parties, the [[Democratic Renewal Party (Benin)|Party for Democratic Renewal]] (PRD) led by the former Prime Minister Adrien Houngbedji and the Alliance Etoile (AE), joined the government coalition.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

Former [[West African Development Bank]] Director [[Yayi Boni]] won the March 2006 election for the presidency in a field of 26 candidates. International observers including the [[United Nations]], [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), and others called the election free, fair, and transparent. President Kérékou was barred from running under the 1990 constitution due to term and age limitations. President Yayi was inaugurated on April 6, 2006.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

Benin held legislative elections on March 31, 2007, for the 83 seats in the National Assembly. The Force Cowrie for an Emerging Benin (FCBE), a coalition of parties, closely linked to President Yayi, won a plurality of the seats in the National Assembly, providing the president with considerable influence over the legislative agenda.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

[[File:Pea Whistle.jpg|thumb|A metal pea whistle.]]

A '''whistle''' is an instrument which produces sound from a stream of gas, most commonly air. It may be mouth-operated, or powered by air pressure, steam, or other means. Whistles vary in size from a small slide whistle or [[nose flute]] type to a large multi-piped [[Organ (music)|church organ]].

Whistles have been around since early humans first carved out a gourd or branch and found they could make sound with it. In [[prehistoric Egypt]], small shells were used as whistles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arroyos |first1=Rafael Pérez |title=Egypt: Music in the Age of the Pyramids |date=2003 |publisher=Centro de Estudios Egipcios |location=Madrid |isbn=978-8493279615 |page=28 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many present day wind instruments are inheritors of these early whistles. With the rise of more mechanical power, other forms of whistles have been developed.

One characteristic of a whistle is that it creates a pure, or nearly pure, tone. The conversion of flow energy to sound comes from an interaction between a solid material and a fluid stream. The forces in some whistles are sufficient to set the solid material in motion. Classic examples are [[wikt:Aeolian|Aeolian]] tones that result in [[Conductor gallop|galloping power lines]], or the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] (the so-called &quot;Galloping Gertie&quot; of popular media). Other examples are circular disks set into vibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chanaud |first1=Robert C. |title=Observations of Oscillatory Radial Flow between a Fixed Disk and a Free Disk |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |date=1970 |volume=47 |issue=5B |pages=1471–2 |doi=10.1121/1.1912065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the geometry, there are two basic types of whistles: those that generate sound through oscillations of fluid mass flow, and those that generate sound through oscillations of the force applied to the surrounding medium.

==History==

===Early whistles===

[[File:Carved whalebone whistle dated 1821. London. 8 cm long.jpg|thumb|Carved [[whalebone]] whistle dated 1821. 8&amp;nbsp;cm long.]]
Whistles made of bone or wood have been used for thousands of years.

Whistles were used by the Ancient Greeks to keep the stroke of [[galley]] slaves. The English used whistles during the [[Crusades]] to signal orders to archers. Boatswain pipes were also used in the [[age of sail]] aboard naval vessels to issue commands and salute dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whistle|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-4/Whistle.html|website=How Products are Made|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseph Hudson===

[[Joseph Hudson (inventor)|Joseph Hudson]] set up J Hudson &amp; Co in Birmingham, UK in 1870. With his younger brother James, he designed the 'Acme City' brass whistle. This became the first referee whistle used at association football matches during the [[1878–79 FA Cup|1878–79 Football Association Cup]] match between Nottingham Forest and Sheffield. Prior to the introduction of the whistle, handkerchiefs were used by the umpires to signal to the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gdfra.org.au/history_of_the_whistle.htm|title=History of the Whistle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bobbypfeife.ogg|thumb|A police whistle being blown]]
In 1883 he began experimenting with pea-whistle designs that could produce an intense sound that could grab attention from over a mile away. His invention was discovered by accident, when he accidentally dropped his violin and it shattered on the floor. Observing how the discordant sound of the breaking strings travelled ([[Trill (music)|trill effect]]), Hudson had the idea to put a pea in the whistle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gdfra.org.au/history_of_the_whistle.htm History of the Whistle]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, whistles were much quieter, and were only thought of as musical instruments or toys for children. After observing the problems that local police were having with effectively communicating with rattles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cross|first=David|title=On the Beat in Birmingham - Rules and regulations|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/beat_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 March 2014|date=2011-02-17|quote=Police whistles came much later; the early Victorian constable would have carried a small wooden rattle.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor&quot;&gt;Taylor, J. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050218125210/http://www.constabulary.com/mystery/rattle.htm &quot;The Victorian Police Rattle Mystery&quot;]

''The Constabulary'' (2003) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218043036/http://www.constabulary.com/mystery/rattle.htm |date=February 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he realised that his whistle designs could be used as an effective aid to their work.&lt;ref name=&quot;acme&quot;&gt;[https://www.acmewhistles.co.uk/the-first-whistle ACME Whistles]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudson demonstrated his whistle to [[Scotland Yard]] and was awarded his first contract in 1884. Both Ratchet rattles and whistles were used to call for back-up in areas where neighbourhood beats overlapped, and following their success in London, the whistle was adopted by most police in the United Kingdom (UK).

This police whistle monopoly gradually made Hudson the largest whistle manufacturer in the world, supplying police forces and other general services everywhere. His whistle is still used by many forces worldwide. His design, was improved as the 'Acme Thunderer', the first ever pea whistle, which remains the most used whistle in the world; for train guards, dog handlers and police officers. From the 1880s and 1890s, J. Hudson &amp; Co began facing greater competition, as other whistle manufacturing companies were established, including W. Dowler &amp; Sons, J. Barrall, R. A. Walton, H. A. Ward and A. De Courcy &amp; Co. In 1987, Ron Foxcroft released the Fox 40 pealess whistle, designed to replace the pea whistle and be more reliable.

==Typical sources and uses==

Human [[whistling]] unaided by any instrument can be used for musical recreation or as a [[whistled language]] for communication over distances too great for articulate speech, among many other purposes.  Musical instruments include the [[nose whistle]] or [[nose flute]], the [[tin whistle]] and the [[slide whistle]].  Since a whistle produces a loud sound that carries over a great distance, whistles are useful for signalling.  On ships, the [[boatswain's call]] is used to alert members of the crew. A [[dog whistle]] can be used to train a dog for hunting, herding, or other occupations. Industrial plants often use a [[steam whistle]] to signal shift changes or to give alarms of emergencies; steam locomotives were equipped with [[train whistle]]s for warning and signalling. A small-scaled steam whistle is found on a [[whistling kettle]], to alert the user that the water is boiling.  Storage tanks may be equipped with a whistle vent which sounds continually as the tank is being filled; when the tank level covers the vent pipe, the whistle stops and the tank is full.

They also occur as accidental byproducts of fluid flow such as supersonic jets, cavity resonances, whistling telephone wires, and idling circular saws.

[[File:Bermuda-CIA_WFB_Map.png|right|thumb|Map of the island of Bermuda]]

[[Bermuda]] was originally discovered in 1503 by Spanish explorer [[Juan de Bermúdez]]. In 1609, the English [[Virginia Company]], which had established [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew and passengers of {{ship||Sea Venture}} steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent it from sinking, then landed ashore. Bermuda's first capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|St.&amp;nbsp;George's]], was established in 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Bermuda – History and Heritage|date=6 November 2007|work=Smithsonian|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/destination-hunter/bermuda-history-heritage.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120524174308/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/destination-hunter/bermuda-history-heritage.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 May 2012|accessdate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia Company administered the island as an extension of Virginia until 1614; its [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]], the [[Somers Isles Company]], took over in 1615 and managed the island until 1684, when the company's charter was revoked and Bermuda became an English [[Crown Colony]]. Following the [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 unification]] of the parliaments of Scotland and England, which created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the islands of Bermuda became a [[British Overseas Territory#Collective titles|British Crown Colony]].

When [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] joined Canada in 1949, Bermuda became the oldest remaining British colony. It has been the most populous remaining dependent territory since the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|return of Hong Kong to China]] in 1997. Bermuda became known as a &quot;[[British Overseas Territory]]&quot; in 2002, as a result of the [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]].

==Initial discovery and early colony==
[[File:Map_of_Bermuda_1511_legatio_babylonica.jpg|right|thumb|270x270px|First map of the island of Bermuda in 1511, made by [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] in his book ''Legatio Babylonica'']]

The earliest depiction of the island is the inclusion of &quot;La Bermuda&quot; in the map of [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera|Pedro Martyr]]'s 1511 ''Legatio Babylonica''. The earliest description of the island was [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]]' account of his 1515 visit with [[Juan de Bermudez]] aboard ''La Garza''. [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]] in 1527 affirms the island was named after the captain who discovered it. [[Henry Harrisse]] documents earlier voyages by Juan Bermúdez in 1498, 1502, and 1503, though [[John Henry Lefroy]] noted Bermúdez left no account of visiting the island. [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] lists a 1505 discovery by Juan Bermúdez, citing the investigation into the ''Archivo de Indias'' by Roberto Barreiro-Meiro. Compounding the confusion is the record of a Francisco Bermudez accompanying [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage, a Diego Bermudez accompanying Columbus on his fourth voyage, and Juan's brother Diego Bermudez accompanying [[Ponce de León]] in a 1513 voyage. Thus, the only clearly documented account is of Juan Bermudez visiting the island in 1515, with the implication he had discovered the island on an earlier voyage. The island was definitely on the homeward course for returning Spaniards, as they followed the [[Gulf Stream]] north followed by the [[Westerlies]] just north of Bermuda. The Spanish avoided the uninhabited island's reefs and hurricanes, calling it Demoniorum Insulam. Yet, Spanish Rock bears the date of 1543, but little further details. A Frenchman called Russell was wrecked there in 1570, followed by the Englishman Henry May in 1593, but both managed to escape. Spanish Capt. Diego Ramirez was stranded on the rocks of Bermuda after a storm in 1603, when he discovered the &quot;devils reported to be about Bermuda&quot; were actually the outcry of the [[Bermuda petrel]]. He did note the former presence of men, including remnants of a wreck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrisse|first1=Henry|title=The Discovery of North America|date=1892|publisher=James Clegg, Aldine Press|location=Rochdale|pages=665, 676, 691, 695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lefroy|first1=John|title=Memorial of the Discovery and Early Settlement of the Bermudas or Somers Islands|date=1877|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|location=London|pages=1–3, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Henry|title=The Adventurers of Bermuda|date=1958|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|pages=18–24, 29–34|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison|first=Samuel|title=The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages, 1492–1616|url=https://archive.org/details/europeandiscover00mori_2|url-access=registration|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1974|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/europeandiscover00mori_2/page/499 499]–501, 238, 506, 528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barreiro-Meiro|first1=Roberto|title=Las Islas Bermudas Y Juan Bermudez|date=1970|publisher=Instituto Historico De Marina|location=Madrid|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityandculture.bm/pages/portuguese-rock|title=Department of Community &amp; Cultural Affairs – Portuguese Rock|work=communityandculture.bm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 1585, an English ship ''Tiger'' commanded by [[Richard Grenville]] on his return from the [[Roanoke Colony]], fought and [[Action off Bermuda (1585)|captured a larger Spanish ship]] ''Santa Maria de San Vicente'' off the shores of Bermuda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hakluyt&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hakluyt Society|title=Works, Volumes 104–105|year=1967|pages=169 &amp; 786|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHngAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=|author1-link=Hakluyt Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 1609 shipwreck of ''Sea Venture'' ===

[[File:Sylvester Jordain - Discovery of the Barmudas.jpg|right|thumb|267x267px|Sylvester Jordain's ''A Discovery of the Barmudas''.]]
[[File:Bermuda-The State House.jpg|thumb|The [[State House, Bermuda|State House]], the building that housed the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]] from 1620 until 1815.]]

On 2 June 1609, Sir [[George Somers]] had set sail aboard {{ship||Sea Venture}}, the new [[flagship]] of the [[London Company|Virginia Company]], leading a fleet of nine vessels, loaded with several hundred settlers, food and supplies for the new English colony of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir George Somers (1554–1610)|author=Mark Nicholls|publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia|url=http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Somers_Sir_George_1554-1610|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somers had previous experience sailing with both Sir [[Francis Drake]] and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]. The fleet was caught in a storm on 24 July, and ''Sea Venture'' was separated and began to founder. When the reefs to the East of Bermuda were spotted, the ship was deliberately driven on them to prevent its sinking, thereby saving all aboard, 150 sailors and settlers, and one dog. [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', in which the character [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]] refers to the &quot;still-vex'd Bermoothes&quot; (I.ii.229), is thought to have been inspired by [[William Strachey]]'s account of this shipwreck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodward|first=Hobson|title=A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest|url=https://archive.org/details/bravevesseltruet0000wood|url-access=registration|publisher=Viking|year=2009|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bravevesseltruet0000wood/page/191 191–199]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survivors spent nine months on Bermuda. The [[master's mate]] was lost at sea when ''Sea Venture''{{'}}s longboat was [[pinnace (ship's boat)|rigged with a mast]] and sent in search of Jamestown. He was not seen again. The remainder built two new ships: ''Deliverance'' at {{convert|40|ft|m}} and 80&amp;nbsp;tons, and ''Patience'' at {{convert|29|ft|m}} and 30&amp;nbsp;tons, mostly from [[Bermuda cedar]]. When the two new vessels were complete, most of the survivors set sail on 10 May, completing their journey to Jamestown on 8 June 1610. Christopher Carter and Edward Waters remained, the latter being accused of murder, while four others had died, including [[John Rolfe]]'s infant daughter. Later in Jamestown, Rolfe's wife died and he married [[Pocahontas]], daughter of [[Chief Powhatan]]. They arrived only to find the colony's population almost annihilated by the [[Starving Time (Jamestown)|Starving Time]], which had left only sixty survivors. According to [[William Monson (Royal Navy officer)|Sir William Monson]], the &quot;swine brought from Bermuda&quot; saved Virginia until the timely arrival of [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord De La Warre]].&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|43–56}}

Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'' in June and found Carter and Waters alive. Somers soon died, however, and while his heart was buried at Saint Georges, his nephew, Captain Matthew Somers, returned his embalmed body to England for burial at [[Dorset]].&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|51–52}}

Two years later, in 1612, the Virginia Company's Royal Charter was officially extended to include the island, and a party of sixty settlers was sent on ''Plough'', under the command of Sir [[Richard Moore (Governor)|Richard Moore]], the island's first governor. Joining the three men left behind by ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' (who had taken up residence on Smith's Island), they founded and commenced construction of the town of [[St. George, Bermuda|St. George]], designated as Bermuda's first capital, the oldest continually inhabited English town in the [[New World]].&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;

Bermuda struggled throughout the following seven decades to develop a viable economy. The Virginia Company, finding the colony unprofitable, briefly handed its administration to the Crown in 1614. The following year, 1615, King [[James I of England|James I]] granted a charter to a new company, the [[Somers Isles Company]], formed by the same shareholders, which ran the colony until it was dissolved in 1684. (The Virginia Company itself was dissolved after its charter was revoked in 1624). Representative government was introduced to Bermuda in 1620, when its [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]] held its first session, and it became a self-governing colony.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;{{rp|76–77,138–139,178–179}}

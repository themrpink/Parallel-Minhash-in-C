The output of the ANFIS system isn't providing correct information, but only a [[Fuzzy set]] notation, for example [0,0.2,0.4,0]. After converting the set notation back into numerical values the accuracy get worse. This makes Fuzzy qualitative simulation a bad choice for practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fuzzy qualitative trigonometry |author=Liu, Honghai and Coghill, George M and Barnes, Dave P |journal=International Journal of Approximate Reasoning |volume=51 |number=1 |pages=71–88 |year=2009 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/j.ijar.2009.07.003|s2cid=47212 |url=http://pure.aber.ac.uk/ws/files/124705/Published_Fuzzy_Qualitative_Trigonometry_IJAR.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''statistician''' is a person who works with theoretical or applied [[statistics]]. The profession exists in both the [[private sector|private]] and [[public sector]]s. It is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects, and statisticians may work as employees or as [[statistical consultant]]s.&lt;ref name=ONET&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-2041.00 |title=O*NET OnLine: 15-2041.00 - Statisticians  |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statslife.org.uk/careers/types-of-job |title=Royal Statistical Society StatsLife Types of Job |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the work==
According to the United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], as of 2014, 26,970 jobs were classified as ''statistician'' in the United States. Of these people, approximately 30 percent worked for governments (federal, state, or local).&lt;ref name=bls&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/statisticians.htm |author=Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor  |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |edition=2016-17 |title=Statisticians |accessdate=30 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2016, the median pay for statisticians in the United States was $80,500.&lt;ref name=bls/&gt;  Additionally, there is a substantial number of people who use statistics and data analysis in their work but have job titles other than ''statistician'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |title=Statisticians |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514232329/http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |archivedate=14 May 2011 |author=Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |edition=2010-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Actuary|actuaries]], [[Applied mathematics|applied mathematicians]], [[economist]]s, data scientists, data analysts (predictive analytics), [[financial analyst]]s, [[psychometrician]]s, [[sociologist]]s, [[epidemiologist]]s, and [[Quantitative psychology|quantitative psychologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |title=Statisticians |author=Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |edition=2006-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001105634/http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |archivedate=1 October 2007 |accessdate=3 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statisticians are included with the [[profession|professions]] in various national and international occupational classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/docs/resol08.pdf |title=International Labour Organisation (ILO) International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) ISCO-08 classification structure |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&amp;TVD=122372&amp;CVD=122374&amp;CPV=21&amp;CST=01012011&amp;CLV=2&amp;MLV=4 |title=Canadian National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2011 21 - Professional occupations in natural and applied sciences |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the BLS, &quot;Overall employment is projected to grow 33% from 2016 to 2026, much faster than average for all occupations.

A '''computer number format''' is the internal representation of numeric values in digital device hardware and software, such as in programmable [[computer]]s and [[calculator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

The encoding between numerical values and bit patterns is chosen for convenience of the operation of the computer;{{cn|date=June 2020}} the encoding used by the computer's instruction set generally requires conversion for external use, such as for printing and display. Different types of processors may have different internal representations of numerical values and different conventions are used for integer and real numbers. Most calculations are carried out with number formats that fit into a processor register, but some software systems allow representation of arbitrarily large numbers using multiple words of memory.

==Binary number representation==
{{See also|Integer (computer science)}}
Computers represent data in sets of binary digits.  The representation is composed of bits, which in turn are grouped into larger sets such as bytes.

A ''[[bit]]'' is a [[Binary numeral system|binary]] [[Numerical digit|digit]] that represents one of two [[state (computer science)|states]].  The concept of a bit can be understood as a value of either ''1'' or ''0'', ''on'' or ''off'', ''yes'' or ''no'', ''true'' or ''false'', or [[encoding|encoded]] by a switch or [[Toggle switch|toggle]] of some kind.

While a single bit, on its own, is able to represent only two values, a [[Bit string|string of bits]] may be used to represent larger values.  For example, a string of three bits can represent up to eight distinct values as illustrated in Table 1.

As the number of bits composing a string increases, the number of possible ''0'' and ''1'' combinations increases [[Exponentiation|exponentially]].  While a single bit allows only two value-combinations and two bits combined can make four separate values and so on.  The amount of possible combinations doubles with each binary digit added as illustrated in Table 2.

Groupings with a specific number of bits are used to represent varying things and have specific names.

A ''[[byte]]'' is a bit string containing the number of bits needed to represent a [[Character (computing)|character]].  On most modern computers, this is an eight bit string.  Because the definition of a byte is related to the number of bits composing a character, some older computers have used a different bit length for their byte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=byte definition|url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/B/byte.html|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many [[Computer Architecture|computer architectures]], the byte is the smallest [[Byte addressing|addressable unit]], the atom of addressability, say.&lt;!-- Find an external source for this --&gt;  For example, even though 64-bit processors may address memory sixty-four bits at a time, they may still split that memory into eight-bit pieces.  This is called byte-addressable memory.  Historically, many [[CPU]]s read data in some multiple of eight bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microprocessor and CPU (Central Processing Unit)|url=http://www.networkdictionary.com/hardware/mc.php|publisher=Network Dictionary|accessdate=1 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003225434/http://www.networkdictionary.com/hardware/mc.php|archive-date=3 October 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the byte size of eight bits is so common, but the definition is not standardized, the term [[Octet (computing)|octet]] is sometimes used to explicitly describe an eight bit sequence.

A ''[[nibble]]'' (sometimes ''nybble''), is a number composed of four bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=nybble definition|url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/N/nybble.html|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Being a [[half-byte]], the nibble was named as a play on words.  A person may need several nibbles for one bite from something; similarly, a nybble is a part of a byte.  Because four bits allow for sixteen values, a nibble is sometimes known as a [[hexadecimal digit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nybble|url=http://www.techterms.com/definition/nybble|publisher=TechTerms.com|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Octal and hexadecimal number display==
{{See also|Base64}}
[[Octal]] and hexadecimal encoding are convenient ways to represent binary numbers, as used by computers. Computer engineers often need to write out binary quantities, but in practice writing out a binary number such as 1001001101010001 is tedious and prone to errors. Therefore, binary quantities are written in a base-8, or &quot;octal&quot;, or, much more commonly, a base-16, &quot;hexadecimal&quot; (''hex''), number format.  In the decimal system, there are 10 digits, 0 through 9, which combine to form numbers. In an octal system, there are only 8 digits, 0 through 7.  That is, the value of an octal &quot;10&quot; is the same as a decimal &quot;8&quot;, an octal &quot;20&quot; is a decimal &quot;16&quot;, and so on.   In a hexadecimal system, there are 16 digits, 0 through 9 followed, by convention, with A through F.  That is, a hexadecimal &quot;10&quot; is the same as a decimal &quot;16&quot; and a hexadecimal &quot;20&quot; is the same as a decimal &quot;32&quot;.  An example and comparison of numbers in different bases is described in the chart below.

When typing numbers, formatting characters are used to describe the number system, for example 000_0000B or 0b000_00000 for binary and 0F8H or 0xf8 for hexadecimal numbers.

Each of these number systems is a positional system, but while decimal weights are powers of 10, the octal weights are powers of 8 and the hexadecimal weights are powers of 16. To convert from hexadecimal or octal to decimal, for each digit one multiplies the value of the digit by the value of its position and then adds the results. For example:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \text{octal } 756 \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; (7 \times 8^2) + (5 \times 8^1) + (6 \times 8^0) \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; (7 \times 64) + (5 \times 8) + (6 \times 1) \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; 448 + 40 + 6 \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; \text{decimal } 494
\end{align}
\qquad
\begin{align}
&amp; \text{hex } \mathrm{3b2} \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; (3 \times 16^2) + (11 \times 16^1) + (2 \times 16^0) \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; (3 \times 256) + (11 \times 16) + (2 \times 1) \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; 768 + 176 + 2 \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; \text{decimal } 946
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Representing fractions in binary==

===Fixed-point numbers===

[[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] formatting can be useful to represent fractions in binary.

The number of bits needed for the precision and range desired must be chosen to store the fractional and integer parts of a number. For instance, using a 32-bit format, 16 bits may be used for the integer and 16 for the fraction.

The eight's bit is followed by the four's bit, then the two's bit, then the one's bit.  The fractional bits continue the pattern set by the integer bits.  The next bit is the half's bit, then the quarter's bit, then the ⅛'s bit, and so on.  For example:
{| class=&quot;toccolours&quot;
|- style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!       || ||  || || integer bits   || fractional bits
|-
| 0.500 ||=||  {{sfrac|1|2}}||=||colspan=2| 00000000 00000000.10000000 00000000
|-
| 1.250 ||=||{{sfrac|1|1|4}}||=||colspan=2| 00000000 00000001.01000000 00000000
|-
| 7.375 ||=||{{sfrac|7|3|8}}||=||colspan=2| 00000000 00000111.01100000 00000000
|}
This form of encoding cannot represent some values in binary. For example, the fraction {{sfrac|1|5}}, 0.2 in decimal, the closest approximations would be as follows:
{| class=&quot;toccolours&quot;
|-
|  13107 / 65536 ||=|| 00000000 00000000.00110011 00110011 ||=|| 0.1999969... in decimal
|-
|  13108 / 65536 ||=|| 00000000 00000000.00110011 00110100 ||=|| 0.2000122... in decimal
|}

Even if more digits are used, an exact representation is impossible. The number {{sfrac|1|3}}, written in decimal as 0.333333333..., continues indefinitely. If prematurely terminated, the value would not represent {{sfrac|1|3}} precisely.

===Floating-point numbers===
While both unsigned and signed integers are used in digital systems, even a 32-bit integer is not enough to handle all the range of numbers a calculator can handle, and that's not even including fractions. To approximate the greater range and precision of [[real number]]s, we have to abandon signed integers and fixed-point numbers and go to a &quot;[[floating point|floating-point]]&quot; format.

In the decimal system, we are familiar with floating-point numbers of the form ([[scientific notation]]):

: 1.1030402 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.1030402 &amp;times; 100000 = 110304.02

or, more compactly:

: 1.1030402E5

which means &quot;1.1030402 times 1 followed by 5 zeroes&quot;. We have a certain numeric value (1.1030402) known as a &quot;[[significand]]&quot;, multiplied by a power of 10 (E5, meaning 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; or 100,000), known as an &quot;[[exponentiation|exponent]]&quot;. 
If we have a negative exponent, that means the number is multiplied by a 1 that many places to the right of the decimal point. For example:

: 2.3434E&amp;minus;6 = 2.3434 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.3434 &amp;times; 0.000001 = 0.0000023434

The advantage of this scheme is that by using the exponent we can get a much wider range of numbers, even if the number of digits in the significand, or the &quot;numeric precision&quot;, is much smaller than the range. 
Similar binary floating-point formats can be defined for computers. There is a number of such schemes, the most popular has been defined by [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE). The [[IEEE floating point|IEEE 754-2008]] standard specification defines a 64 bit floating-point format with:

* an 11-bit binary exponent, using &quot;excess-1023&quot; format. Excess-1023 means the exponent appears as an unsigned binary integer from 0 to 2047; subtracting 1023 gives the actual signed value
* a 52-bit significand, also an unsigned binary number, defining a fractional value with a leading implied &quot;1&quot;
* a sign bit, giving the sign of the number.

Let's see what this format looks like by showing how such a number would be stored in 8 bytes of memory:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! byte 0 
| S || x10 || x9 || x8 || x7 || x6 || x5 || x4
|-
! byte 1 
| x3 || x2 || x1 || x0 || m51 || m50 || m49 || m48
|-
! byte 2 
| m47 || m46 || m45 || m44 || m43 || m42 || m41 || m40
|-
! byte 3 
| m39 || m38 || m37 || m36 || m35 || m34 || m33 || m32
|-
! byte 4 
| m31 || m30 || m29 || m28 || m27 || m26 || m25 || m24
|-
! byte 5 
| m23 || m22 || m21 || m20 || m19 || m18 || m17 || m16
|-
! byte 6 
| m15 || m14 || m13 || m12 || m11 || m10 || m9 || m8
|-
! byte 7 
| m7 || m6 || m5 || m4 || m3 || m2 || m1 || m0

where &quot;S&quot; denotes the sign bit, &quot;x&quot; denotes an exponent bit, and &quot;m&quot; denotes a significand bit. Once the bits here have been extracted, they are converted with the computation:

:   &amp;lt;sign&amp;gt; &amp;times; (1 + &amp;lt;fractional significand&amp;gt;) &amp;times; 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lt;exponent&amp;gt; &amp;minus; 1023&lt;/sup&gt;

This scheme provides numbers valid out to about 15 decimal digits, with the following range of numbers:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{ts|ar|font-family:monospace}}
|-
!
! maximum
! minimum
|-
! positive
| 1.797693134862231E+308
| 4.940656458412465E-324
|-
! negative
| -4.940656458412465E-324
| -1.797693134862231E+308

The specification also defines several special values that are not defined numbers, and are known as ''[[NaN]]s'', for &quot;Not A Number&quot;. These are used by programs to designate invalid operations and the like. 
 
Some programs also use 32-bit floating-point numbers. The most common scheme uses a 23-bit significand with a sign bit, plus an 8-bit exponent in &quot;excess-127&quot; format, giving seven valid decimal digits.

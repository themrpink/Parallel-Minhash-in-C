Civil engineers and construction managers work alongside [[architect]]s and supervisors, planners, [[quantity surveyor]]s, the general workforce, as well as subcontractors.  Typically, most jurisdictions have some body of [[drainage law]] to govern to what degree a landowner can alter the drainage from his parcel.

Drainage options for the construction industry include: 
* Point drainage, which intercepts water at gullies (points). Gullies connect to drainage pipes beneath the ground surface and deep excavation is required to facilitate this system. Support for deep trenches is required in the shape of planking, strutting or shoring.
* Channel drainage, which intercepts water along the entire run of the channel. Channel drainage is typically manufactured from concrete, steel, polymer or composites. The interception rate of channel drainage is greater than point drainage and the excavation required is usually much less deep.
The surface opening of channel drainage usually comes in the form of gratings (polymer, plastic, steel or iron) or a single slot (slot drain) that runs along the ground surface (typically manufactured from steel or iron).

=== Drainage in retaining walls ===
Earth retaining structures such as [[retaining wall]]s also need to consider [[groundwater]] drainage. Typical retaining walls are constructed of impermeable material which can block the path of groundwater. When groundwater flow is obstructed, hydrostatic [[water pressure]] buildups against the wall and may cause significant damage. If the water pressure is not drained appropriately, retaining walls can bow, move, fracture and seams separate. The water pressure can also erode soil particles leading to voids behind the wall and [[sinkhole]]s in the above soil. Traditional retaining wall drainage systems can include, [[French Drain]]s, drain pipes or weep holes. To prevent soil erosion, Geotextile filter fabrics are installed with the drainage system.

==Reasons for artificial drainage==
[[Image:MagomeDrainage.jpg|thumb|upright|An agricultural drainage channel outside [[Magome-juku|Magome]], [[Japan]] after a heavy rain. Note that protuberances create turbulent water, preventing sediment from settling in the channel.]]

Wetland soils may need drainage to be used for [[agriculture]]. In the northern United States and Europe, [[glaciation]] created numerous small [[lake]]s which gradually filled with [[humus]] to make [[marsh]]es. Some of these were drained using open [[ditch]]es and trenches to make [[muck (soil)|muckland]]s, which are primarily used for high value crops such as [[vegetable]]s.

The largest project of this type in the world has been in process for centuries in the [[Netherlands]]. The area between [[Amsterdam]], [[Haarlem]] and [[Leiden]] was, in [[prehistoric]] times swampland and small lakes. Turf cutting ([[Peat]] [[mining]]), [[subsidence]] and shoreline [[erosion]] gradually caused the formation of one large lake, the [[Haarlemmermeer]], or lake of Haarlem. The invention of wind-powered [[Windpump|pumping engines]] in the 15th century permitted drainage of some of the marginal land, but the final drainage of the lake had to await the design of large, [[steam power]]ed pumps and agreements between regional authorities. The elimination of the lake occurred between 1849 and 1852, creating thousands of km² of new land.

Coastal plains and river deltas may have seasonally or permanently high [[water table]]s and must have drainage improvements if they are to be used for agriculture. An example is the flatwoods [[citrus]]-growing region of [[Florida]]. After periods of high rainfall, drainage pumps are employed to prevent damage to the citrus groves from overly wet soils. [[Rice]] production requires complete control of water, as fields need to be flooded or drained at different stages of the crop cycle. The Netherlands has also led the way in this type of drainage, not only to drain lowland along the shore, but actually pushing back the sea until the original nation has been greatly enlarged.

In moist climates, soils may be adequate for cropping with the exception that they become [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogged]] for brief periods each year, from [[snow]] melt or from heavy [[rain]]s. Soils that are predominantly [[clay]] will pass water very slowly downward, meanwhile plant roots suffocate because the excessive water around the roots eliminates air movement through the soil.&lt;br&gt;
Other soils may have an [[impervious]] layer of mineralized soil, called a [[hardpan]] or relatively impervious rock layers may underlie shallow soils. Drainage is especially important in [[Fruit tree|tree fruit]] production. Soils that are otherwise excellent may be waterlogged for a week of the year, which is sufficient to kill fruit trees and cost the productivity of the land until replacements can be established. In each of these cases appropriate drainage carries off temporary flushes of water to prevent damage to [[annual plant|annual]] or [[perennial plant|perennial]] crops.

Drier areas are often farmed by [[irrigation]], and one would not consider drainage necessary. However, irrigation water always contains minerals and [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, which can be concentrated to toxic levels by [[evapotranspiration]]. Irrigated land may need periodic flushes with excessive irrigation water and drainage to control [[soil salinity]].

[[File:A-Train w-Time2013 Web.jpg|thumb|upright=1.40|Six Earth observation satellites comprising the [[A-train (satellite constellation)|A-train]] satellite constellation as of 2014.]]

An '''Earth observation satellite''' or '''Earth remote sensing satellite''' is a [[satellite]] used or designed for [[Earth observation]] (EO) from [[orbit]], including [[spy satellite]]s and similar ones intended for non-military uses such as [[natural environment|environment]]al monitoring, [[meteorology]], [[cartography]] and others. The most common type are '''Earth imaging satellites''', that take [[satellite image]]s, analogous to [[aerial photograph]]s; some EO satellites may perform [[remote sensing]] without forming pictures, such as in [[GNSS radio occultation]].

The first occurrence of satellite remote sensing can be dated to the launch of the first artificial satellite, [[Sputnik 1]], by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatem&quot;/&gt; Sputnik 1 sent back radio signals, which scientists used to study the [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuznetsov&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznetsov|first1=V.D.|last2=Sinelnikov|first2=V.M.|last3=Alpert|first3=S.N.|title=Yakov Alpert: Sputnik-1 and the first satellite ionospheric experiment|journal=Advances in Space Research|date=June 2015|volume=55|issue=12|pages=2833–2839|doi=10.1016/j.asr.2015.02.033|bibcode=2015AdSpR..55.2833K}}&lt;/ref&gt;
NASA launched the first American satellite, [[Explorer 1]], on January 31, 1958. The information sent back from its radiation detector led to the discovery of the Earth's [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=James A. Van Allen|url=http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=86|website=nmspacemuseum.org|publisher=New Mexico Museum of Space History|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[TIROS-1]] spacecraft, launched on April 1, 1960 as part of NASA's [[Television Infrared Observation Satellite]] (TIROS) program, sent back the first television footage of weather patterns to be taken from space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatem&quot;/&gt;

{{As of|2008}}, more than 150 Earth observation satellites were in orbit, recording data with both passive and active sensors and acquiring more than 10 terabits of data daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatem&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tatem|first1=Andrew J.|last2=Goetz|first2=Scott J.|last3=Hay|first3=Simon I.|title=Fifty Years of Earth-observation Satellites|journal=American Scientist|date=2008|volume=96|issue=5|pages=390–398 |doi=10.1511/2008.74.390|pmid=19498953|pmc=2690060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Earth]] observation satellites carry instruments that should be operated at a relatively low altitude. Altitudes below 500-600 kilometers are in general avoided, though, because of the significant [[Drag (physics)|air-drag]] at such low altitudes making frequent orbit [[reboost]] maneuvres necessary. The Earth observation satellites [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS-1, ERS-2]] and [[Envisat]] of [[European Space Agency]] as well as the [[MetOp]] spacecraft of [[EUMETSAT]] are all operated at altitudes of about 800&amp;nbsp;km. The [[PROBA|Proba-1]], [[Proba-2]] and [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite|SMOS]] spacecraft of European Space Agency are observing the Earth from an altitude of about 700&amp;nbsp;km. The Earth observation satellites of UAE, [[DubaiSat-1]] &amp; [[DubaiSat-2]] are also placed in [[Low Earth orbit|Low Earth Orbits (LEO)]] orbits and providing [[satellite imagery]] of various parts of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DubaiSat-2, Earth Observation Satellite of UAE |url=http://mbrsc.ae/en/page/dubai-sat-2|publisher=Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DubaiSat-1, Earth Observation Satellite of UAE|url=http://mbrsc.ae/en/page/dubai-sat-1 |publisher=Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To get (nearly) global coverage with a low orbit it must be a [[polar orbit]] or nearly so. A low orbit will have an orbital period of roughly 100 minutes and the Earth will rotate around its polar axis with about 25° between successive orbits, with the result that the [[ground track]] is shifted towards west with these 25° in longitude. Most are in [[Sun-synchronous orbit]]s.

Spacecraft carrying instruments for which an altitude of 36000 km is suitable sometimes use a [[geostationary orbit]]. Such an orbit allows uninterrupted coverage of more than 1/3 of the Earth. Three geostationary spacecraft at longitudes separated with 120° can cover the whole Earth except the extreme polar regions. This type of orbit is mainly used for [[Weather satellite|meteorological satellites]].

== History ==
{{see also|Remote sensing#History}}

[[Herman Potočnik]] explored the idea of using orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground in his 1928 book, ''The Problem of Space Travel''. He described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments. The book described [[geostationary]] satellites (first put forward by [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]]) and discussed communication between them and the ground using radio, but fell short of the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sasmac.cn/portal/html/fc4f335929b0df0d0129b0e348f90003/_content/10_07/09/1278668367217.html|title=Introduction to satellite|website=www.sasmac.cn|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GOES 8 Spac0255.jpg|thumb|300px|[[GOES-8]], a [[United States]] weather satellite.]]

A weather satellite is a type of [[satellite]] that is primarily used to monitor the [[weather]] and [[climate]] of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NESDIS&quot;&gt;NESDIS, [http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/satellites.html Satellites.] Retrieved on 4 July 2008 {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; These meteorological satellites, however, see more than [[cloud]]s and cloud systems. City lights, [[fire]]s, effects of [[pollution]], [[auroral light|aurora]]s, [[Dust storm|sand and dust storms]], [[snow]] cover, [[ice]] mapping, boundaries of [[ocean current]]s, [[energy]] flows, etc., are other types of environmental information collected using weather satellites.

Weather satellite images helped in monitoring the volcanic ash cloud from [[Mount St. Helens]] and activity from other volcanoes such as [[Mount Etna]].&lt;ref&gt;NOAA, [http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=15216 NOAA Satellites, Scientists Monitor Mt. St. Helens for Possible Eruption.] Retrieved on 4 July 2008 {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoke from fires in the western United States such as [[Colorado]] and [[Utah]] have also been monitored.

=== Environmental monitoring ===
[[File:Blue Marble 2002.png|thumb|upright=1.40|left|Composite satellite image of the Earth, showing its entire surface in [[equirectangular projection]]]]

Other environmental satellites can assist [[environmental monitoring]] by detecting changes in the Earth's vegetation, atmospheric trace gas content, sea state, ocean color, and ice fields. By monitoring vegetation changes over time, droughts can be monitored by comparing the current vegetation state to its long term average.&lt;ref&gt;NASA, [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Drought/ Drought.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819121047/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Drought/|date=19 August 2008}} Retrieved on 4 July 2008 {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 2002 oil spill off the northwest coast of [[Spain]] was watched carefully by the European [[Envisat|ENVISAT]], which, though not a weather satellite, flies an instrument (ASAR) which can see changes in the sea surface. Anthropogenic emissions can be monitored by evaluating data of tropospheric NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

These types of satellites are almost always in [[Sun-synchronous orbit|Sun-synchronous]] and [[Frozen orbit|&quot;frozen&quot;]] orbits. The sun-synchronous orbit is in general sufficiently close to polar to get the desired global coverage while the relatively constant geometry to the [[Sun]] mostly is an advantage for the instruments. The [[Frozen orbit|&quot;frozen&quot;]] orbit is selected as this is the closest to a circular orbit that is possible in the [[Geopotential model|gravitational field]] of the Earth.

=== Mapping ===
Terrain can be mapped from space with the use of satellites, such as [[Radarsat-1]]&lt;ref&gt;Grunsky, E.C. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/7969/22036/01024985.pdf?arnumber=1024985 The use of multi-beam Radarsat-1 satellite imagery for terrain mapping.] Retrieved on 4 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TerraSAR-X]].

[[File:Gem-Leiden-OpenTopo.jpg|{{largethumb}}|right|Topographic map of Leiden.]]

'''Leiden''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|d|ən}}, {{IPA-nl|ˈlɛi̯də(n)|lang|Nl-Leiden.ogg}}; in [[English language|English]] and [[Archaism|archaic]] [[Dutch language|Dutch]] also ''Leyden'') is a [[List of cities in the Netherlands by province|city]] and [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[South Holland]], [[Netherlands]]. The municipality of Leiden had a population of 123,856 in August 2017, but the city forms one densely connected agglomeration with its suburbs [[Oegstgeest]], [[Leiderdorp]], [[Voorschoten]] and [[Zoeterwoude]] with 206,647 inhabitants. The [[Statistics Netherlands|Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS) further includes [[Katwijk]] in the agglomeration which makes the total population of the Leiden urban agglomeration 270,879, and in the larger Leiden urban area also [[Teylingen]], [[Noordwijk]], and [[Noordwijkerhout]] are included with in total 348,868 inhabitants. Leiden is located on the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Oude Rijn]], at a distance of some {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} from [[The Hague]] to its south and some {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Amsterdam]] to its north. The recreational area of the Kaag Lakes ([[Kagerplassen]]) lies just to the northeast of Leiden.

A university city since 1575, Leiden has been one of [[Europe]]'s most prominent scientific centres for more than four centuries. Leiden is a typical university city, university buildings are scattered throughout the city and the many students from all over the world give the city a bustling, vivid and international atmosphere. Many important scientific discoveries have been made here, giving rise to Leiden's motto: ‘City of Discoveries’. The city houses [[Leiden University]], the oldest university of the Netherlands, and [[Leiden University Medical Center]]. Leiden University is one of Europe's top universities, with thirteen Nobel Prize winners. It is a member of the League of European Research Universities and positioned highly in all international academic rankings. It is twinned with [[Oxford]], the location of the United Kingdom's oldest [[University of Oxford|university]]. Leiden University and Leiden University of Applied Sciences (Leidse Hogeschool) together have around 35,000 students. Modern scientific medical research and teaching started in the early 18th century in Leiden with Boerhaave.

Leiden is a city with a rich cultural heritage, not only in science, but also in the arts. One of the world's most famous painters, [[Rembrandt]], was born and educated in Leiden. Other famous Leiden painters include [[Lucas van Leyden]], [[Jan van Goyen]] and [[Jan Steen]].

Leiden was formed on an artificial hill (today called the [[Burcht van Leiden]]) at the confluence of the rivers Oude and Nieuwe Rijn (Old and New Rhine). In the oldest reference to this, from circa 860, the settlement was called ''Leithon''. The name is said to be from Germanic *leitha- &quot;canal&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Leyden+jar&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title = Online Etymology Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[dative]] [[pluralis]], thus meaning &quot;at the canals&quot;. &quot;Canal&quot; is actually not the completely proper word. A leitha (later &quot;lede&quot;) was a human-modified natural river, partly natural, partly artificial.

Leiden has in the past erroneously been associated with the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[castellum|outpost]] [[Brittenburg|Lugdunum Batavorum]]. This particular ''castellum'' was thought to be located at the Burcht of Leiden, and the city's name was thought to be derived from the Latin name Lugdunum. However the castellum was in fact closer to the town of [[Katwijk]], whereas the Roman settlement near modern-day Leiden was called [[Matilo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Jona Lendering |url = https://www.livius.org/ga-gh/germania/lugdunum.html |title = Towns in Germania Inferior: Lugdunum (Brittenburg) |publisher = Livius.org |accessdate = 11 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landlord of Leiden, situated in a stronghold on the hill (motte), was initially subject to the Bishop of [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] but around 1100 the [[burgrave]]s became subject to the county of Holland. This county got its name in 1101 from a domain near the stronghold: ''Holtland'' or ''Holland''.

Leiden was sacked in 1047 by Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]]. Early 13th century, [[Ada, Countess of Holland]] took refuge here when she was fighting in a civil war against her uncle, [[William I, Count of Holland]]. He besieged the stronghold and captured Ada.

Leiden received [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in 1266. In 1389, its population had grown to about 4,000 persons.

=== Siege of 1420 ===

In 1420, during the [[Hook and Cod wars]], [[John III, Duke of Bavaria|Duke John III of Bavaria]] along with his army marched from [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]] in the direction of Leiden in order to conquer the city since Leiden did not pay the new [[Count of Holland]] [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]], his niece and only daughter of [[William II, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing|Count William VI of Holland]].

Burgrave Filips of Wassenaar and the other local noblemen of the Hook faction assumed that the duke would besiege Leiden first and send small units out to conquer the surrounding citadels. But [[John of Bavaria-Straubing|John of Bavaria]] chose to attack the citadels first.

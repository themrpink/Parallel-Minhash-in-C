==Geography and territorial organization==
[[File:Vista_panoramica_de_la_ciudad_de_Sucre.png|thumb|center|280px|Sucre, Bolivia]]
Sucre is divided into eight numbered districts: the first five of these are urban districts, while Districts 6, 7, and 8 are rural districts. Each is administered by a Sub-Mayor ({{lang-es|Subalcalde|links=no}}), appointed by the Mayor of Sucre. The rural districts include numerous rural communities outside the urban area.

Sucre is served by [[Alcantari Airport]], situated {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} to the South.

==Climate==
Sucre has a [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: Cwb),&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate-Data.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/3849/ |title=Climate: Sucre - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=2014-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with mild temperatures year round.

The highest record temperature was {{convert|34.7|C}}  while the lowest record temperature was {{convert|-6|C}}

==The City of Four Names==
Each of the well known names represent a specific era of the city's history.

* ''Charcas'' was the indigenous name for the place upon which the Spaniards built the colonial city.
* ''La Plata'' was the name given to the emerging Hispanic city of privilege and honor.
* The name ''Chuquisaca'' was bestowed upon the city during the independence era.
* ''Sucre'' honors the great marshal of the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] (December 9, 1824), [[Antonio José de Sucre]].
* &quot;La Ciudad Blanca&quot; is a nickname that was bestowed upon the city because many of the colonial style houses and structures are painted white.

==Sports==
Sucre has the most important sport facilities in Bolivia, and the most practiced sport in the city is [[association football|football]]. Sucre has the second-biggest football and Olympic stadium in the country, the [[Estadio Olímpico Patria|Estadio Patria]]. As of the 2019 Apertura, the 2008 champion club [[Universitario de Sucre]] was relegated from the [[Liga de Fútbol Profesional Boliviano|Bolivian professional league]], leaving the city without a first-division team.

Other sports are also practiced, such as swimming at la Piscina Bolivariana, basketball at numerous courts around the city, as well as [[taekwondo]], [[kung fu]], [[volleyball]], [[tennis]] and [[racquetball]].

==Education==
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}

Sucre is home to the second oldest public university in the Americas, the [[Universidad Mayor Real y Pontificia de San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca]]; often abbreviated USFX. The university draws students both nationally and internationally, and different departments can be found scattered around the city. Degree areas at USFX include law, political science, medicine, odontology, chemistry, business administration, financial sciences, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facultades |url=https://www.usfx.bo/principal/facultades/ |website=Universidad de San Francisco Xavier |publisher=Universidad de San Francisco Xavier |accessdate=December 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city also features other academic institutions such as a campus of the private university [[Universidad Privada del Valle]] also known as Univalle, the National Teachers School (Escuela Nacional de Maestros &quot;Mariscal Sucre&quot;), the Universidad Privada Domingo Savio, and the [[Universidad Andina Simón Bolívar]].

==Architecture==
The city of Sucre contains many old and classic buildings:

===The House of Freedom ===

[[File:Freedomhouse.jpg|thumb|200px|View of House of Freedom from the main square]]
[[File:The 25th of May Plaza.jpg|thumb|200x200px|May 25th square]]
Built in 1621, it is perhaps the most important building of the nation. The republic was founded in this building by [[Simón Bolivar|Simón Bolívar]] who wrote the Bolivian Constitution.&lt;br/&gt;
The &quot;Salón de la Independencia&quot; houses the Bolivian Declaration of Independence.

===National Library===
Built on the same year of the foundation of the Republic, it is the first and the most important historical, bibliographical and documentation center of the country. The National Library has documents that date from 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Archivo y Biblioteca Nacionales de Bolivia, Anuario de Estudios Bolivianos, Archivisticos y Bibliograficos. No.14 - 2008, p.301ff&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolitan Cathedral===
{{main|Cathedral of Sucre}}
Built between 1559 and 1712, the cathedral has the &quot;Museo Catedraliceo&quot; which is the first and most important religious museum of the country. The &quot;Pinacoteca&quot; has a vast collection of paintings by Colonial and Republican masters and also by Europeans such as Bitti, Fourchaudt and Van Dyck. The Cathedral contains a vast amount of jewelry made of gold, silver and gemstones.

===Archbishop's Palace===

Built in 1609, was an important religious and historic institution during colonial times.

=== Departmental Autonomous Government of Chuquisaca===
[[File:20170806 Bolivia 1293 crop Sucre sRGB (24128466548).jpg|thumb|200px|View of the Chuquisaca Governorship from the main square]]

One of the best buildings of republican architecture, this was completed in 1896. It was the first Palace of Government of Bolivia but when the government was moved to La Paz it became the Chuquisaca Governorship Palace.

===Supreme Court of Justice===

On July 16, 1827 the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court of the Nation]] was established. Its first president was Dr. Manuel Maria Urcullo. Others prominent in its history include Dr. Pantaleon Dalence, who was twice president of the Supreme Court and through his qualities became known as the 'Father of Bolivian Justice'. This institution was installed in several places before moving to its current building. It was designed in the neoclassical style under the canons of French academicism and was inaugurated on May 25, 1945.

===General Cemetery===
Some of the areas date from the late nineteenth century. Ornate mausoleums, tombs and gardens with magnificent old trees populate the space that is home to the graves of important people in the arts, sciences and the history both of Bolivia and of Latin America. Because of the tranquility offered by the site, many students choose to study here.

===Churches and Convents===

'''Guar gum''', also called '''guaran''', is a [[galactomannan]] [[polysaccharide]] extracted from [[Guar|guar bean]]s that has thickening and stabilizing properties useful in food, feed, and industrial applications. The guar seeds are mechanically dehusked, hydrated, milled and screened according to application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/agn/jecfa-additives/specs/monograph3/additive-218.pdf |title=foa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically produced as a free-flowing, off-white powder.

==Production and trade==

The guar bean is principally grown in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[United States|U.S.]], [[Australia]] and [[Africa]]. India produces about 2.5 - 3 million tons of guar annually, making it the largest producer, with about 80% of world production. In India, [[Rajasthan]], [[Gujarat]] and [[Haryana]] are the main producing regions, and [[Jodhpur]], [[Sri Ganganagar]] and [[Hanumangarh]] in Rajasthan are the major Guar trading markets. The US has produced 4,600 to 14,000 tonnes of guar over the last 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;Guar in West Texas http://lubbock.tamu.edu/files/2013/06/Guar-Production-Industry-Texas-May2013-Trostle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Texas acreage since 1999 has fluctuated from about 7,000 to 50,000 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trostle|first1=Calvin|title=Guar Update, West Texas|url=http://lubbock.tamu.edu/files/2012/05/Guar-Production-Industry-Prospects-18May2012-Texas.pdf|publisher=Texas AgriLife Research &amp; Extension Center|accessdate=5 February 2017|date=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world production for guar gum and its derivatives is about 1.0 Million tonnes. Non-food guar gum accounts for about 40% of the total demand.

==Properties==

===Chemical composition===
[[File:Guaran.svg|thumb]]

Chemically, guar gum is an exo-[[polysaccharide]] composed of the [[sugar]]s [[galactose]] and [[mannose]].{{cn|date=March 2019}} The backbone is a linear chain of β 1,4-linked mannose residues to which galactose residues are 1,6-linked at every second mannose, forming short side-branches. Guar gum has the ability to withstand temperatures of 80 °C (176 °F) for five minutes.

===Solubility and viscosity===
Guar gum is more soluble than [[locust bean gum]] due to its extra [[galactose]] branch points. Unlike locust bean gum, it is not self-gelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;LSBU&quot;&gt;Martin Chaplin &quot;Water Structure and Behavior: Guar Gum&quot;. April 2012. London South Bank University&lt;/ref&gt; Either [[borax]] or [[calcium]] can [[cross-link]] guar gum, causing it to [[gel]]. In water, it is [[nonionic]] and [[hydrocolloid]]al. It is not affected by ionic strength or [[pH]], but will degrade at extreme pH and temperature (e.g. pH 3 at 50&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=&quot;LSBU&quot; /&gt; It remains stable in solution over pH range 5-7. Strong [[acid]]s cause [[hydrolysis]] and loss of viscosity and alkalies in strong concentration also tend to reduce viscosity. It is insoluble in most hydrocarbon solvents. The viscosity attained is dependent on time, temperature, concentration, pH, rate of agitation and particle size of the powdered gum used. The lower the temperature, the lower the rate at which viscosity increases, and the lower the final viscosity. Above 80°, the final viscosity is slightly reduced. Finer guar powders swell more rapidly than larger particle size coarse powdered gum.

Guar gum shows a clear low shear plateau on the flow curve and is strongly shear-thinning. The rheology of guar gum is typical for a random coil polymer. It does not show the very high low shear plateau viscosities seen with more rigid polymer chains such as xanthan gum. It is very [[thixotropic]] above 1% concentration, but below 0.3%, the thixotropy is slight. Guar gum shows viscosity synergy with [[xanthan gum]]. Guar gum and [[micellar casein]] mixtures can be slightly thixotropic if a biphase system forms.&lt;ref name=&quot;LSBU&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn A. Kuntz. &quot;Special Effects With Gums&quot;. December 1999. Food Product Design&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thickening===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
One use of guar gum is a thickening agent in foods and medicines for humans and animals. Because it is gluten-free, it is used as an additive to replace wheat flour in baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fenster|first=Carol|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrCZAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|title=Gluten-Free 101: The Essential Beginner's Guide to Easy Gluten-Free Cooking|date=2014-01-08|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-1-118-53912-5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:41&lt;/sup&gt; It has been shown to be beneficial to health. It has been shown to reduce serum cholesterol and lower blood glucose levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.drugs.com/npp/guar-gum.html|title=Guar Gum Uses, Benefits &amp; Dosage - Drugs.com Herbal Database|work=Drugs.com|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional benefits have been seen in one's efforts to lose weight where, when ingested, its water-absorbing properties cause it to swell in the stomach causing a 'full' sensation sooner.

Guar gum is economical as well. Because it has almost eight times the water-thickening ability of other agents (e.g.[[cornstarch]]), only a small quantity is needed for producing sufficient [[viscosity]].{{clarify|reason=for thickening what foodstuffs for people, animals, as well as medicines for both.|date=February 2016}}{{cn|date=March 2019}} Because less is required, costs are reduced.

[[Inspection]] is a major component of quality control, where physical product is examined visually (or the end results of a service are analyzed). Product inspectors will be provided with lists and descriptions of unacceptable [[product defect]]s such as [[Fracture|cracks]] or surface [[wikt:blemish|blemish]]es for example.&lt;ref name=&quot;AftFunda97&quot; /&gt;

== History and introduction ==
{{See also|History of technology}}
Early [[stone tools]] such as [[anvil]]s had no holes and were not designed as [[interchangeable parts]]. [[Mass production]] established processes for the creation of parts and system with identical dimensions and design, but these processes are not uniform and hence some customers were unsatisfied with the result. Quality control separates the act of [[test method|testing]] [[product (business)|product]]s to uncover defects from the decision to allow or deny product release, which may be determined by fiscal constraints.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shewhart&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shewhart|first1=Walter A. (Walter Andrew)|last2=Deming|first2=W. Edwards (William Edwards)|title=Statistical method from the viewpoint of quality control|date=1939|publisher=The Graduate School, The Department of Agriculture|location=Washington|pages=1–5|url=https://archive.org/stream/CAT10502416#page/2/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; For contract work, particularly work awarded by government agencies, quality control issues are among the top reasons for not renewing a contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs1910.pdf |title=Position Classification Standard for Quality Assurance Series, GS-1910 |date=March 1983 |publisher=US Office of Personnel Management |access-date=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest form of quality control was a sketch of the desired item. If the sketch did not match the item, it was rejected, in a simple [[Go/no go]] procedure. However, manufacturers soon found it was difficult and costly to make parts be exactly like their depiction; hence around 1840 tolerance limits were introduced, wherein a design would function if its parts were measured to be within the limits. Quality was thus precisely defined using devices such as [[plug gauge]]s and [[ring gauge]]s. However, this did not address the problem of defective items; recycling or disposing of the [[waste]] adds to the cost of production, as does trying to reduce the defect rate. Various methods have been proposed to prioritize quality control issues and determine whether to leave them unaddressed or use [[quality assurance]] techniques to improve and stabilize production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shewhart&quot; /&gt;

==Notable approaches==
There is a tendency for individual consultants and organizations to name their own unique approaches to quality control—a few of these have ended up in widespread use:

In [[telecommunication]], a '''quasi-analog signal''' is a [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]] that has been converted to a form suitable for [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] over a specified analog [[Communication channel|channel]].  

The [[specification]] of the analog channel should include [[frequency range]], [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[signal-to-noise ratio]], and [[envelope delay distortion]]. When quasi-analog form of [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]] is used to convey [[message]] [[traffic]] over [[dial-up]] [[telephone]] systems, it is often referred to as voice-[[data]]. A [[modem]] may be used for the conversion process.

      <text bytes="5398" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]] and [[computer engineering]], the '''queuing delay''' or '''queueing delay''' is the time a job waits in a [[Queue (data structure)|queue]] until it can be executed. It is a key component of [[network delay]]. In a switched network, queuing delay is the time between the completion of signaling by the call originator and the arrival of a ringing signal at the call receiver. Queuing delay may be caused by delays at the originating switch, intermediate switches, or the call receiver servicing switch. In a data network, queuing delay is the sum of the delays between the request for service and the establishment of a circuit to the called data terminal equipment (DTE). In a packet-switched network, queuing delay is the sum of the delays encountered by a packet between the time of insertion into the network and the time of delivery to the address. &lt;ref name=Gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Queuing Delay|url=http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-029/_4318.htm|accessdate=2012-02-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219004715/http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-029/_4318.htm|archive-date=2012-12-19|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This term is most often used in reference to [[router (computing)|router]]s. When [[Packet (information technology)|packet]]s arrive at a router, they have to be processed and transmitted. A router can only process one packet at a time. If packets arrive faster than the router can process them (such as in a [[burst transmission]]) the router puts them into the queue (also called the [[Buffer (computer science)|buffer]]) until it can get around to transmitting them. Delay can also vary from packet to packet so averages and statistics are usually generated when measuring and evaluating queuing delay. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delay and Loss in Packet-Switched Networks|url=http://59.67.152.66:8000/newenglish/delay.htm|accessdate=2012-02-12|author=Keith W. Ross|author2=James F. Kurose|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130114163812/http://59.67.152.66:8000/newenglish/delay.htm|archivedate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a queue begins to fill up due to traffic arriving faster than it can be processed, the amount of delay a packet experiences going through the queue increases. The speed at which the contents of a queue can be processed is a function of the transmission rate of the facility. This leads to the classic delay curve. The average delay any given packet is likely to experience is given by the formula 1/(μ-λ) where μ is the number of packets per second the facility can sustain and λ is the average rate at which packets are arriving to be serviced. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queueing Delay|url=http://www.hill2dot0.com/wiki/index.php?title=Queuing_delay|publisher=Hill Association|accessdate=2 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904041151/http://www.hill2dot0.com/wiki/index.php?title=Queuing_delay|archive-date=4 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This formula can be used when no packets are dropped from the queue. 

The maximum queuing delay is proportional to buffer size. The longer the line of packets waiting to be transmitted, the longer the average waiting time is. The router queue of packets waiting to be sent also introduces a potential cause of packet loss. Since the router has a finite amount of buffer memory to hold the queue, a router which receives packets at too high a rate may experience a full queue. In this case, the router has no other option than to simply discard excess packets.

When the transmission protocol uses the dropped-packets symptom of filled buffers to regulate its transmit rate, as the Internet's TCP does, bandwidth is fairly shared at near theoretical capacity with minimal [[network congestion]] delays. Absent this feedback mechanism the delays become both unpredictable and rise sharply, a symptom also seen as freeways approach capacity; metered onramps are the most effective solution there, just as TCP's self-regulation is the most effective solution when the traffic is packets instead of cars). This result is both hard to model mathematically and quite counterintuitive to people who lack experience with mathematics or real networks.  Failing to drop packets, choosing instead to buffer an ever-increasing number of them, produces [[bufferbloat]].

In [[Kendall's notation]], the M/M/1/K queuing model, where K is the size of the buffer, may be used to analyze the queuing delay in a specific system. Kendall's notation should be used to calculate the queuing delay when packets are dropped from the queue.  The M/M/1/K queuing model is the most basic and important queuing model for network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://streaming.stat.iastate.edu/~stat330/notes/day30.pdf |accessdate=November 7, 2008 |title=stat.iastate.edu}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fiber optics]], the '''radiation angle''' is half the [[vertex angle]] of the cone of [[light]] emitted at the exit face of an [[optical fiber]].  

The cone boundary is usually defined (a) by the angle at which the [[far-field]] [[irradiance]] has decreased to a specified fraction of its maximum value or (b) as the cone within which there is a specified fraction of the total radiated [[Power (physics)|power]] at any point in the [[far field]].

      <text bytes="951" xml:space="preserve">For an [[optical fiber]] or [[waveguide]], a '''radiation mode''' or '''unbound mode''' is a mode which is not confined by the fiber core. Such a mode has fields that are transversely oscillatory everywhere external to the waveguide, and exists even at the limit of zero [[wavelength]].

Specifically, a radiation mode is one for which 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \sqrt{n^2(a) k^2 -(l/a)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''β'' is the imaginary part of the axial [[propagation constant]], integer ''l'' is the azimuthal index of the mode, ''n''(''r'') is the [[refractive index]] at radius ''r'', ''a'' is the [[Fiber_optics#Principle_of_operation|core]] radius, and ''k'' is the free-space wave number, ''k'' = 2π/''λ'', where ''λ'' is the wavelength. Radiation modes correspond to [[refracted ray]]s in the terminology of [[geometric optics]].

In the field of [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] design the term '''radiation pattern''' (or '''antenna pattern''' or '''far-field pattern''') refers to the ''directional'' (angular) dependence of the strength of the [[radio waves]] from the antenna or other source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balanis&quot;&gt;Constantine A.

Jordan &amp; Keith G. Balmain; “Electromagnetic Waves and Radiating Systems” (2nd ed. 1968) Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|81-203-0054-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly in the fields of [[fiber optics]], [[laser]]s, and [[integrated optics]], the term radiation pattern may also be used as a synonym for the '''[[Near and far field|near-field]] pattern''' or '''Fresnel pattern'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEEdict1997&quot;&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, “The IEEE standard dictionary of electrical and electronics terms”; 6th ed.

Standards Coordinating Committee 10, Terms and Definitions; Jane Radatz, (chair)]&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to the ''positional'' dependence of the [[electromagnetic field]] in the [[Near and far field|near-field]], or Fresnel region of the source. The near-field pattern is most commonly defined over a plane placed in front of the source, or over a cylindrical or spherical surface enclosing it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balanis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEEdict1997&quot;/&gt;

The far-field pattern of an antenna may be determined experimentally at an [[antenna measurement|antenna range]], or alternatively, the near-field pattern may be found using a '''[[Electromagnetic near-field scanner|near-field scanner]]''', and the radiation pattern deduced from it by computation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balanis&quot;/&gt;  The far-field radiation pattern can also be calculated from the antenna shape by computer programs such as [[Numerical Electromagnetics Code|NEC]]. Other software, like [[HFSS]] can also compute the near field.

The far field radiation pattern may be represented graphically as a plot of one of a number of related variables, including; the [[field strength]] at a constant (large) radius (an '''amplitude pattern''' or '''field pattern'''), the power per unit solid angle ('''power pattern''') and the [[Antenna gain|directive gain]]. Very often, only the relative amplitude is plotted, normalized either to the amplitude on the antenna [[Antenna boresight|boresight]], or to the total radiated power. The plotted quantity may be shown on a linear scale, or in [[Decibel|dB]].  The plot is typically represented as a three-dimensional graph (as at right), or as separate graphs in the [[vertical plane]] and [[horizontal plane]]. This is often known as a '''polar diagram'''.

==Reciprocity==
It is a fundamental property of antennas that the '''receiving pattern''' (sensitivity as a function of direction) of an antenna when used for [[Radio receiver|receiving]] is identical to the far-field radiation pattern of the antenna when used for [[Transmitter|transmitting]]. This is a consequence of the [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocity theorem]] of electro-magnetics and is proved below.  Therefore, in discussions of radiation patterns the antenna can be viewed as either transmitting or receiving, whichever is more convenient.  Note however that this applies only to the passive antenna elements.  Active antennas that include amplifiers or other components are no longer reciprocal devices.

==Typical patterns==
[[Image:Sidelobes en.svg|thumb|Typical polar radiation plot.  Most antennas show a pattern of &quot;lobes&quot; or maxima of radiation.  In a [[Directional antenna|directive antenna]], shown here, the largest lobe, in the desired direction of propagation, is called the &quot;[[main lobe]]&quot;.  The other lobes are called &quot;[[sidelobe]]s&quot; and usually represent radiation in unwanted directions.]]

Since [[electromagnetic radiation]] is [[dipole radiation]], it is not possible to build an antenna that radiates coherently equally in all directions, although such a hypothetical [[isotropic antenna]] is used as a reference to calculate [[antenna gain]].

The simplest antennas, [[Monopole antenna|monopole]] and [[dipole antenna]]s, consist of one or two straight metal rods along a common axis.  These [[Axial symmetry|axially symmetric]] antennas have radiation patterns with a similar symmetry, called [[Omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] patterns; they radiate equal power in all directions perpendicular to the antenna, with the power varying only with the angle to the axis, dropping off to zero on the antenna's axis.  This illustrates the general principle that if the shape of an antenna is symmetrical, its radiation pattern will have the same symmetry.

In most antennas, the radiation from the different parts of the antenna [[Interference (wave propagation)|interferes]] at some angles; the radiation pattern of the antenna can be considered an [[interference pattern]].  This results in zero radiation at certain angles where the radio waves from the different parts arrive [[out of phase]],  and  [[local maximum|local maxima]] of radiation at other angles where the radio waves arrive [[in phase]].  Therefore, the radiation plot of most antennas shows a pattern of maxima called &quot;''lobes''&quot; at various angles, separated by &quot;''[[null (radio)|null]]s''&quot; at which the radiation goes to zero.  The larger the antenna is compared to a wavelength, the more lobes there will be.

In a [[directional antenna]] in which the objective is to emit the radio waves in one particular direction, the antenna is designed to radiate most of its power in the lobe directed in the desired direction.  Therefore in the radiation plot this lobe appears larger than the others; it is called the &quot;''[[main lobe]]''&quot;.  The axis of maximum radiation, passing through the center of the main lobe, is called the &quot;''beam axis''&quot; or ''[[Antenna boresight|boresight axis]]''&quot;. In some antennas, such as split-beam antennas, there may exist more than one major lobe.  A minor lobe is any lobe except a major lobe.

The other lobes, representing unwanted radiation in other directions, are called &quot;''[[side lobe]]s''&quot;.  The side lobe in the opposite direction (180°) from the main lobe is called the &quot;''back lobe''&quot;.

Minor lobes usually represent radiation in undesired directions, so in directional antennas a design goal is usually to reduce the minor lobes. Side lobes are normally the largest of the minor lobes. The level of minor lobes is usually expressed as a ratio of the power density in the lobe in question to that of the major lobe. This ratio is often termed the side lobe ratio or side lobe level. Side lobe levels of −20&amp;nbsp;dB or greater are usually not desirable in many applications. Attainment of a side lobe level smaller than −30&amp;nbsp;dB usually requires very careful design and construction. In most radar systems, for example, low side lobe ratios are very important to minimize false target indications through the side lobes.

==Proof of reciprocity==
{{Antennas|characteristics}}

For a complete proof, see the [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)]] article.  Here, we present a common simple proof limited to the approximation of two antennas separated by a large distance compared to the size of the antenna, in a homogeneous medium. The first antenna is the test antenna whose patterns are to be investigated; this antenna is free to point in any direction. The second antenna is a reference antenna, which points rigidly at the first antenna.

Each antenna is alternately connected to a transmitter having a particular source impedance, and a receiver having the same input impedance (the impedance may differ between the two antennas).

It is assumed that the two antennas are sufficiently far apart that the properties of the transmitting antenna are not affected by the load placed upon it by the receiving antenna. Consequently, the amount of power transferred from the transmitter to the receiver can be expressed as the product of two independent factors; one depending on the directional properties of the transmitting antenna, and the other depending on the directional properties of the receiving antenna.

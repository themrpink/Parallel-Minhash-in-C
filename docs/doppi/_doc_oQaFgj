The 1969 Lunokhod 1A (Lunokhod 0, Lunokhod No.&amp;nbsp;201) was destroyed during launch, the 1970 ''[[Lunokhod 1]]'' and the 1973 ''[[Lunokhod 2]]'' landed on the Moon, and ''Lunokhod 3'' (Lunokhod No.&amp;nbsp;205, planned for 1977) was never launched. The successful missions were in operation concurrently with the [[Zond program|Zond]] and [[Luna programme|Luna]] series of Moon flyby, [[orbiter]] and landing missions.

The Lunokhods were primarily designed to support the [[Soviet crewed lunar programs|Soviet human Moon missions]] during the [[Moon race]]. Instead, they were used as remote-controlled [[robot]]s for exploration of the lunar surface and return its pictures after the successful [[Apollo program|Apollo]] human lunar landings and cancellation of the Soviet human Moon programme.

The Lunokhods were transported to the lunar surface by [[Luna programme|Luna]] spacecraft, which were launched by [[Proton-K]] rockets. The Moon lander part of the Luna spacecraft for Lunokhods was similar to the one for [[sample-return mission]]s. The Lunokhods were designed by [[Alexander Kemurdzhian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Cosmic Mirror|date=March 6, 2003|issue=250|url=http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~dfischer/mirror/250.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030501225021/http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~dfischer/mirror/250.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 1, 2003|title=Lunochod's chief designer is dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Lavochkin]].

Lunokhod's original primary mission was the back-up for [[Soviet crewed lunar programs|L3 crewed Moon expeditions]] and for the later [[Zvezda (moonbase)|Zvezda]] [[Colonization of the Moon|lunar base]].{{cn|date=April 2019}}

For mission safety, weeks before the human mission on a [[LK (spacecraft)|LK lander]], an LK-R uncrewed lander from the L3 lunar expedition complex and two Lunokhod automated rovers would be sent to the Moon for a preliminary study of the surface around LK-R and LK sites, to act as radio beacons for precision landings of LK-R and LK, and for a visual evaluation of the status of the site.  Should the craft (either the LK or the Lunokhod) used by the cosmonauts fail, the LK-R could be used as a reserve escape craft in case of failure to start and lift off from the Moon. They could also be used for regular research. The crewed version of Lunokhod was additionally equipped with a stock of oxygen with hose socket, standing pads and manual pilot control for the cosmonaut in forward section.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

==''Lunokhod 1''==
{{Main|Lunokhod 1}}
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2019}}
After the destruction of the original Lunokhod, Soviet engineers began work immediately on another lunar vehicle.  ''[[Lunokhod 1]]'' (vehicle 8ЕЛ№203) was the first of two uncrewed lunar rovers successfully landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union as part of its Lunokhod programme. The spacecraft which carried ''Lunokhod 1'' was named ''[[Luna 17]]''. ''Lunokhod 1'' was the first roving remote-controlled robot to land on another world.

''Luna 17'' was launched on November 10, 1970 at 14:44:01 UTC. After reaching Earth [[parking orbit]], the final stage of ''Luna 17''{{'}}s launching rocket fired to place it into a trajectory towards the Moon (November 10, 1970 at 14:54 UTC). After two course correction manoeuvres (on November 12 and 14) it entered lunar orbit on November 15, 1970 at 22:00 UTC.

The spacecraft soft-landed on the Moon in the [[Mare Imbrium|Sea of Rains]] on November 17, 1970 at 03:47 UTC. The lander had dual ramps from which the payload, ''Lunokhod 1'', could descend to the surface. At 06:28 UT the rover moved down the ramps and onto the Moon.

To be able to work in a vacuum a special fluoride based lubricant was used for the rover's mechanical parts, and the electric motors, one in each wheel hub, were enclosed in pressurised containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|network=[[SVT2]]|series=Vetenskapens värld|title=Den ryska månbilen|airdate=11 February 2008|url= http://www.svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=32313&amp;a=1049140&amp;lid=is_search527895&amp;lpos=0&amp;queryArt527895=m%E5nbil&amp;sortOrder527895=0&amp;doneSearch=true&amp;sd=47225&amp;from=siteSearch&amp;pageArt527895=0|language=Swedish}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.synlube.com/moon.htm |publisher=Synlube Lube-4-Life |title=Moon applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rover ran during the lunar day, stopping occasionally to recharge its batteries using its solar panels. At night, it hibernated until the next sunrise, heated by the [[radioisotope heater unit]].

===Rover description===
[[Image:Lunokhod-2 model.jpg|thumb|Model of Lunokhod vehicle]]
[[Image:Lunokhod-2 model, detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of Lunokhod's wheels]]

''Lunokhod 1'' was a lunar vehicle formed of a tub-like compartment with a large convex lid on eight independently-powered wheels. Its length was 2.3 metres. It was equipped with a cone-shaped antenna, a highly directional [[helical antenna]], four [[television cameras]], and special extendable devices to impact the lunar soil for density measurements and mechanical property tests.

An [[X-ray spectrometer]], [[X-ray telescope]], Cosmic Ray Detector, and a [[laser]] device were also included. The vehicle was powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] which were recharged during the lunar day by a [[solar cell]] array mounted on the underside of the lid. During the lunar nights, the lid was closed and a [[polonium]]-210 heat source kept the internal components at [[operating temperature]].

The rover stood 135&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;ft 5 in) high and had a mass of 840&amp;nbsp;kg (1,850&amp;nbsp;lb). It was about 170&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;ft 7 in) long and 160&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;ft 11 in) wide and had eight wheels each with an independent suspension, motor and brake. The rover had two speeds, approximately {{convert|1|and|2|km/h|mph|abbr=on|1}}.

====Payload====
The rover's payload included cameras (two television and four panoramic telephotometers), a RIFMA X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, an RT-1 X-ray telescope, a PrOP odometer/penetrometer, a RV-2N radiation detector, and a TL laser retroreflector.{{cn|date=April 2019}}

==''Lunokhod 2''==
{{Main|Lunokhod 2}}
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2019}}
''[[Lunokhod 2]]'' (vehicle 8ЕЛ№204) was the second and more advanced of the two Lunokhod rovers. The launcher put the spacecraft into Earth parking orbit on January 8, 1973, followed by a [[translunar injection]]. On January 12, 1973, ''[[Luna 21]]'' was braked into a {{convert|90|by|100|km|mi|abbr=in|0}} [[lunar orbit]].

The ''[[Luna 21]]'' spacecraft landed on the Moon to deploy the second Soviet lunar rover, ''Lunokhod 2''. The primary objectives of the mission were to collect images of the lunar surface, examine ambient light levels to determine the feasibility of astronomical observations from the Moon, perform laser ranging experiments from Earth, observe solar X-rays, measure local magnetic fields, and study mechanical properties of the lunar surface material.

The landing occurred on January 15, 1973 at 23:35 UT in [[Le Monnier (crater)|Le Monnier crater]] (25.85 degrees N, 30.45 degrees E).

After landing the ''Lunokhod 2'' took television images of the surrounding area, then rolled down a ramp to the surface at 01:14 UT on 1973-01-16. It then took pictures of the ''Luna 21'' lander and landing site.

===Rover description===
The rover was equipped with three [[slow-scan television]] cameras, one mounted high on the rover for navigation, which could return high resolution images at different rates&amp;mdash;3.2, 5.7, 10.9 or 21.1 seconds per frame (not frames per second). These images were used by the five-man team of controllers on Earth who sent driving commands to the rover in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronaut.ru/luna/crew.htm|title=Экипажи Лунохода|author=|date=|website=www.astronaut.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were four panoramic cameras mounted on the rover.

Power was supplied by a [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]] on the inside of a round hinged lid which covered the instrument bay, which would charge the batteries when opened. A [[polonium]]-210 radioactive heat source was used to keep the rover warm during the long lunar nights.

Scientific instruments included a [[soil mechanics]] tester, solar X-ray experiment, an [[photometer|astrophotometer]] to measure visible and [[ultraviolet]] light levels, a [[magnetometer]] deployed in front of the rover on the end of a 2.5 [[metre|m]] (8&amp;nbsp;ft 2 in) boom, a [[radiometer]], a [[photodetector]] (Rubin-1) for laser detection experiments, and a French-supplied laser [[corner reflector]].

==Chernobyl legacy==
According to a French documentary television film ''[[Tank on the Moon]]'' by Jean Afanassieff, the Lunokhod design returned to the limelight 15 years later due to the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster]] on April 26, 1986.&lt;ref name=rightpundits&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rightpundits.com/?p=8415 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318020753/http://www.rightpundits.com/?p=8415 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 18, 2011 |title=Lunokhod: From the Moon to Chernobyl, the Little Robot That Could! |first=Andrew |last=Zarowny |website=Right Pundits |date=March 16, 2011 |access-date=June 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[East German]]-built remote controlled [[bulldozer]]s available to Soviet [[civil defense]] troops weighed dozens of tons{{snd}} too heavy to operate on the remaining parts of the partially collapsed reactor building roof. Human labourers could not be employed to shovel debris since work shifts were limited to 90-second intervals due to intense [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cabinet-of-wonders.blogspot.com/2009/02/lunokhod-and-art-of-space.html |title=Lunokhod and the Art of Space |first=Heather |last=McDougal |work=Cabinet of Wonders |date=February 19, 2009 |access-date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lunokhod designers were called back from retirement, and in two weeks rovers were made which used [[nuclear decay]] heat sources for internal rack climate control, their electronic systems were already hardened to partly resist radiation.&lt;ref name=rightpundits/&gt; This benefit allowed the 1986 designers to quickly devise a derived vehicle type for nuclear disaster recovery work. On July 15, two rovers, called STR-1,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; were delivered to the Chernobyl accident zone and proved useful for clearing debris, earning awards for the designers. Due to extremely high radiation levels, both STR-1 rovers eventually failed, and human workers (later named [[Liquidator (Chernobyl)|liquidators]]) were called in once again.&lt;ref name=rightpundits/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/10861/title/Soviet-Official-Admits-That-Robots-Couldn-t-Handle-Chernobyl-Cleanup/ |title=Soviet Official Admits That Robots Couldn't Handle Chernobyl Cleanup |first=Christopher |last=Anderson |journal=The Scientist |location=Canada |date=January 20, 1990 |access-date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lunokhod 1''''' ([[Russian language|Russian:]] '''Луноход-1''' (&quot;Moonwalker 1&quot;), also known as '''Аппарат 8ЕЛ № 203''' (&quot;Device 8EL No. 203&quot;)) was the first of two robotic [[lunar rover]]s landed on the [[Moon]] by the [[Soviet Union]] as part of its [[Lunokhod program]]. The ''[[Luna 17]]'' [[spacecraft]] carried ''Lunokhod 1'' to the Moon in 1970. ''Lunokhod 1'' was the first [[rover (space exploration)|remote-controlled robot &quot;rover&quot;]] to freely move across the surface of an [[astronomical object]] beyond the Earth. It was also the first wheeled craft on another celestial body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404|isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lunokhod programme#Lunokhod 201|Lunokhod 0 (No.201)]], the previous and first attempt to do so, launched in February 1969 but failed to reach orbit.

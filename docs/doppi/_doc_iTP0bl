The Spanish language can be traced back to the monastery of Valpuesta located {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of the city of Burgos. The [[Cartularies of Valpuesta|Valpuesta cartularies]] are significant in the history of the Spanish language, and their status as manuscripts containing the earliest words written in Spanish has been officially recognised.
The first utterings of Spanish continued in the &quot;[[Glosas Emilianenses|Silos Glosses]]&quot;, recorded in the Burgos monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spain.info/en/conoce/grandes-rutas/rutas/camino_de_la_lengua_castellana/ |title=Travel routes in Spain: The Route of the Spanish language in Spain &amp;#124; Spain.info in english |publisher=Spain.info |accessdate=26 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326163556/http://www.spain.info/en/conoce/grandes-rutas/rutas/camino_de_la_lengua_castellana |archivedate=26 March 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Queso de Burgos''', a white cheese which is soft and unctuous (because it is made with [[whey]]). Although originally made with sheep's milk, now cow's milk or mixtures are more common. Each ''[[comarca]]'' (rural district) produces a minor variation, and the major dairies produce an industrial product that is acceptable for people with sensitive digestion.

Burgos is blessed with a moderate climate and this fresh cheese was able to be conserved there without the need for curing of more than 10 days. With the improvement of aseptic industrial production processes this can be extended to about 30 days at a cool 6&amp;nbsp;°C. Its production reaches 35,000 tons annually.

'''Morcilla de Burgos''', a pig's-blood sausage ([[black pudding]]), is a staple country food known across the Iberian peninsula. Spiced with onions and herbs its most noticeable content is rice (often mistaken for fat) which makes it one of the lightest and healthiest products of its kind. Oral tradition says that it must be &quot;salty, smooth and piquant&quot; (see Spanish pages {{ill|Burgos (desambiguación)|es}} for details). As with the Queso de Burgos, several comarcas or towns in the province ([[Cardeñadijo]], [[Sotopalacios]], Aranda de Duero, [[Briviesca]], [[Chalco de Díaz Covarrubias|Covarrubias]], [[Villarcayo]], [[Trespaderne]], [[Miranda de Ebro]]...) made their own morcillas, with minor variations between them.

Even though Burgos is not on a D.O.  wine is a fundamental piece in local gastronomy thanks to nearby wine cellars from Ribera de Duero, Rioja and [[Arlanza (comarca)|Arlanza]] D.O.

=== Festivals ===

The city's main festival is San Pedro y San Pablo, on June 29. Every year, for about two weeks, the city celebrates with fireworks, concerts, sports, folklore, games for children, theater and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aytoburgos.es/cultura/fiestas/san-pedro-y-san-pablo|title=San Pedro y San Pablo {{!}} Ayuntamiento de Burgos|website=www.aytoburgos.es|access-date=2020-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Transportation ==

=== Burgos Airport ===

[[Burgos Airport]] is located only {{convert|5|km|2|abbr=on}} from the city centre, with daily flights to [[Barcelona]] International Airport, and during spring and summer to [[Palma de Mallorca]] and [[Paris Orly]].

[[File:Burgos Rosa de Lima train station.jpg|thumb|Burgos Rosa de Lima train station]]

=== Railway ===

[[File:HighSpeedSpain.svg|thumb|right|Map of the Spanish high-speed railway network.]]
The city is considered a first-class rail route through which one rail lines circulate, operated by [[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]]: [[Madrid–Hendaye railway]]. The faster trains use the AVE line between Madrid and Valladolid.

2010 marked 150 years since the arrival of the first railway to the city; the first train was present on 25 October 1860. Madrid was joined with the French border and this was considered the main route of railway communication between Spain and Europe. Located at the halfway point, Burgos soon become an important hub of communications between the centre and the north.

Since December 2007, the city has been connected to the main provincial capitals by high-speed service [[Alvia]]. It also provides other services, middle and long distance, which connect with the main population centres of the country. 18 long distance trains and 12 middle distance trains circulate through the station each day, which results in around 330,000 yearly users.

The new railway station was opened on 12 December 2008 under the name [[Burgos-Rosa de Lima railway station|Burgos-Rosa de Lima]], belonging to ADIF. It is located in the neighbourhood of Villímar, northeast of the city, and has been adapted for the future arrival of the [[AVE]]. Bus 25 will take you direct to the city centre.

In 2017, [[AVE]] high speed trains will serve the city, connecting it to cities such as [[Madrid]] in only 84 minutes, or [[Bilbao]] in 70 minutes.

=== Trams ===

A project to implement a tram for the city has been planned, which would run the length of the Boulevard, officially called the Avenida de Valencia. It would consist of a line of about {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} long and will originate from the Burgos-Rosa de Lima railway station and end at the [[University of Burgos]]. Its cost is estimated between 80 and 120 million euros.

Due to the economic crisis and real estate, the project has been postponed temporarily until further funding becomes available. In February 2010 work began on the development of the Boulevard, which reserves a lane for public transport: first buses, and eventually the tram.

=== Bus ===

Burgos has an international bus station located in the city centre, just one hundred meters from the [[Cathedral of Burgos|Cathedral]]. It connects the city with nearly every region of Spain, as well as with a wide number of European ([[Amsterdam]], [[Basel]], [[Bern]], [[Bratislava]], [[Brussels]], [[Cologne]], [[Hamburg]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Geneva]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Kyiv]], [[Lisbon]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Lviv]], [[Łódź]], [[London]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Moscow]], [[Munich]], [[Nice]], [[Paris]], [[Porto]], [[Prague]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Sofia]], [[The Hague]], [[Warsaw]], [[Zürich]]) and even [[North African]] ([[Casablanca]], [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]]) cities.

=== Bicycle ===

The city has its own public bicycle rental system, called ''Bicibur''. It has been designed by a local company and has more than 20 points of distribution throughout the city. A network of over {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} of bicycle lanes net the city making it the 6th largest bicycle lane network in Spain and the first in kilometres per resident.

=== Sustainable mobility ===

Burgos has undertaken many efforts concerning sustainable mobility, and it won the CiViTAs City of the Year in 2007, the most important Award at the European level and the Energy Globe Award in 2008 (the sustainability Nobel awards) in the Air Category for the same reason. The city is the leader among Spanish cities in terms of sustainable mobility with big efforts for a city centre free of cars, a free bicycle loan system and 100% clean public transport. Burgos now leads the CiViNET Network of cities concerned with sustainable mobility in Spain and Portugal.

The mayors of Bruges in [[Belgium]]'s [[Flemish Region]] and Burgos signed a treaty on 29 January 2007 in Bruges's city hall for future cooperation. This engagement could be seen as a prologue on the opening of the exhibition Comeliness and Madness. This exhibition on king [[Philip the Handsome]] -who also ruled the Burgundian countries- took place in the Casa del Cordón in Burgos where the monarch died. On 30 January 2007, the exhibition opened in Bruges, the city where Philip the Handsome was born and where the urn with his heart is kept in [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges|Onthaalkerk O.L.V.

=== Chemical ===
Conjunctivitis due to chemicals is treated via [[Therapeutic irrigation|irrigation]] with [[Ringer's lactate]] or [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]]. Chemical injuries, particularly alkali burns, are medical emergencies, as they can lead to severe scarring and intraocular damage. People with chemically induced conjunctivitis should not touch their eyes to avoid spreading the chemical.

== Epidemiology ==
Conjunctivitis is the most common eye disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smeltzer |first1=Suzanne C. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Brunner &amp; Suddarth's textbook of medical-surgical nursing. |date=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia |isbn=9780781785891 |page=1787 |edition=12th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmtjSD1x688C&amp;pg=RA1-PA1787 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815203433/https://books.google.ca/books?id=SmtjSD1x688C&amp;pg=RA1-PA1787|archive-date=15 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of disease is related to the underlying cause which varies by the age as well as the time of year.

It is estimated that acute conjunctivitis affects 6 million people annually in the United States.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt;

Some seasonal trends have been observed for the occurrence of different forms of conjunctivitis. The occurrence of bacterial conjunctivitis peaks from December to April, viral conjunctivitis peaks in the summer months and allergic conjunctivitis is more prevalent throughout the spring and summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- Include more on epidemiology if more info can be found. --&gt;

Conjunctivitis imposes economic and social burdens. The cost of treating bacterial conjunctivitis alone was estimated to be $377 million to $857 million per year.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Approximately 1% of all primary care office visits in the United States are related to conjunctivitis.

'''Sedimentary rocks''' are types of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] that are formed by the accumulation or deposition of [[mineral]] or [[organic matter|organic]] particles at the [[Earth's surface]], followed by [[Cementation (geology)|cementation]]. [[Sedimentation]] is the collective name for processes that cause these particles to settle in place. The particles that form a sedimentary rock are called [[sediment]], and may be composed of [[Detritus (geology)|geological detritus]] (minerals) or [[Detritus|biological detritus]] (organic matter). The geological detritus originated from [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] of existing rocks, or from the solidification of molten lava blobs erupted by volcanoes. The geological detritus is transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice or [[Mass wasting|mass movement]], which are called agents of [[denudation]]. Biological detritus was formed by bodies and parts (mainly shells) of dead aquatic organisms, as well as their fecal mass, suspended in water and slowly piling up on the floor of water bodies ([[marine snow]]). Sedimentation may also occur as dissolved minerals precipitate from water solution.

The sedimentary rock cover of the continents of the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] is extensive (73% of the Earth's current land surface&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Global geologic maps are tectonic speedometers – Rates of rock cycling from area-age frequencies | first1=Bruce H. | last1=Wilkinson | first2=Brandon J. | last2=McElroy | first3=Stephen E. | last3=Kesler | first4=Shanan E. | last4=Peters | first5=Edward D. | last5=Rothman | journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin | year=2008 | volume=121 | issue=5–6 | pages=760–779 | doi=10.1130/B26457.1 | bibcode=2009GSAB..121..760W}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but sedimentary rock is estimated to be only 8% of the volume of the crust.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Buchner|Buchner &amp; Grapes (2011)]], p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Sedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer over a crust consisting mainly of [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s. Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers as [[stratum|strata]], forming a structure called [[bed (geology)|bedding]]. Sedimentary rocks are often deposited in large structures called [[sedimentary basin]]s. Sedimentary rocks have also been found on [[Mars]].

The study of sedimentary rocks and rock strata provides information about the subsurface that is useful for [[civil engineering]], for example in the construction of [[road]]s, [[house]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[canal]]s or other structures. Sedimentary rocks are also important sources of [[natural resource]]s including [[coal]], [[fossil fuel]]s, [[drinking water]] and [[ore]]s.

The study of the sequence of sedimentary rock strata is the main source for an understanding of the [[History of the Earth|Earth's history]], including [[palaeogeography]], [[paleoclimatology]] and the [[Evolutionary history of life|history of life]]. The [[List of academic disciplines|scientific discipline]] that studies the properties and origin of sedimentary rocks is called [[sedimentology]]. Sedimentology is part of both [[geology]] and [[physical geography]] and overlaps partly with other disciplines in the [[Earth science]]s, such as [[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]], [[geomorphology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[structural geology]]. 

==Classification based on origin==

[[File:Uluṟu (Ayers Rock), Sunset.jpg|thumb| [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock) is a large [[sandstone]] formation in [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]].]]

Sedimentary rocks can be subdivided into four groups based on the processes responsible for their formation: clastic sedimentary rocks, biochemical (biogenic) sedimentary rocks, chemical sedimentary rocks, and a fourth category for &quot;other&quot; sedimentary rocks formed by impacts, [[volcanism]], and other minor processes.

===Clastic sedimentary rocks===
{{main|Clastic rock}}
[[File:GLMsed.jpg|thumb|[[Claystone]] deposited in [[Glacial Lake Missoula]], [[Montana]], [[United States]]. Note the very fine and flat bedding, common for deposits coming from [[lake]] beds further away from the source of sediment.]]
Clastic sedimentary rocks are composed of rock fragments (''clasts'') that have been cemented together. The clasts are commonly individual grains of [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], [[clay minerals]], or [[mica]]. However, any type of mineral may be present. Clasts may also be ''lithic fragments'' composed of more than one mineral.

Clastic sedimentary rocks are subdivided according to the dominant particle size. Most geologists use the [[Particle size (grain size)#Wentworth|Udden-Wentworth]] grain size scale and divide unconsolidated sediment into three fractions: [[gravel]] (&gt;2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter), [[sand]] (1/16 to 2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter), and [[mud]] (&lt;1/256&amp;nbsp;mm diameter). Mud is further divided into [[silt]] (1/16 to 1/256&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) and [[clay]] (&lt;1/256&amp;nbsp;mm diameter). The classification of clastic sedimentary rocks parallels this scheme; [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] and [[breccia]]s are made mostly of [[gravel]], [[sandstone]]s are made mostly of [[sand]], and [[mudrock]]s are made mostly of mud. This tripartite subdivision is mirrored by the broad categories of [[rudite]]s, [[arenite]]s, and [[lutite]]s, respectively, in older literature.

The subdivision of these three broad categories is based on differences in clast shape ([[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] and [[breccia]]s), composition ([[sandstone]]s), or grain size or texture ([[mudrock]]s).

====Conglomerates and breccias====
{{main|Conglomerate}}
Conglomerates are dominantly composed of rounded [[gravel]], while [[breccia]]s are composed of dominantly angular [[gravel]].

====Sandstones====
[[File:Sedimentgesteine auf Malta.JPG|thumb|Sedimentary rock with sandstone in [[Malta]]]]
[[File:Lower antelope 3 md.jpg|thumb|[[Antelope Canyon|Lower Antelope Canyon]] was carved out of the surrounding [[sandstone]] by both mechanical weathering and chemical weathering. Wind, sand, and water from [[flash flood]]ing are the primary weathering agents.]]
{{main|Sandstone}}
Sandstone classification schemes vary widely, but most geologists have adopted the Dott scheme,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dott&quot;&gt;[[#Dott|Dott (1964)]]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses the relative abundance of quartz, feldspar, and lithic framework grains and the abundance of a muddy matrix between the larger grains.

:''Composition of framework grains''
:The relative abundance of sand-sized framework grains determines the first word in a sandstone name. Naming depends on the dominance of the three most abundant components [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], or the lithic fragments that originated from other rocks. All other minerals are considered accessories and not used in the naming of the rock, regardless of abundance.

::* Quartz sandstones have &gt;90% quartz grains
::* Feldspathic sandstones have &lt;90% quartz grains and more feldspar grains than lithic grains
::* Lithic sandstones have &lt;90% quartz grains and more lithic grains than feldspar grains

:''Abundance of muddy matrix material between sand grains''
::When sand-sized particles are deposited, the space between the grains either remains open or is filled with mud (silt and/or clay sized particle).
::* &quot;Clean&quot; sandstones with open pore space (that may later be filled with matrix material) are called arenites.
::* Muddy sandstones with abundant (&gt;10%) muddy matrix are called wackes.

Six [[sandstone]] names are possible using the descriptors for grain composition (quartz-, feldspathic-, and lithic-) and the amount of matrix (wacke or arenite). For example, a quartz arenite would be composed of mostly (&gt;90%) quartz grains and have little or no clayey matrix between the grains, a lithic wacke would have abundant lithic grains and abundant muddy matrix, etc.

Although the Dott classification scheme&lt;ref name=&quot;Dott&quot;/&gt; is widely used by sedimentologists, common names like [[greywacke]], [[arkose]], and quartz sandstone are still widely used by non-specialists and in popular literature.

====Mudrocks====
{{main|Mudrock}}
Mudrocks are sedimentary rocks composed of at least 50% [[silt]]- and [[clay]]-sized particles. These relatively fine-grained particles are commonly transported by [[turbulence|turbulent flow]] in water or air, and deposited as the flow calms and the particles settle out of [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]].

Most authors presently use the term &quot;mudrock&quot; to refer to all rocks composed dominantly of mud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blatt1980&quot;&gt;[[#Blatt|Blatt ''et al.'' (1980)]], p. 782&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prothero&quot;&gt;[[#Prothero|Prothero &amp; Schwab (2004)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boggs2006&quot;&gt;[[#Boggs2006|Boggs (2006)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stow&quot;&gt;[[#Stow|Stow (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mudrocks can be divided into siltstones, composed dominantly of silt-sized particles; mudstones with subequal mixture of silt- and clay-sized particles; and claystones, composed mostly of clay-sized particles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blatt1980&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prothero&quot;/&gt; Most authors use &quot;[[shale]]&quot; as a term for a [[Fissility (geology)|fissile]] mudrock (regardless of grain size) although some older literature uses the term &quot;shale&quot; as a synonym for mudrock.

===Biochemical sedimentary rocks===
[[File:OilShaleEstonia.jpg|thumb|Outcrop of [[Ordovician]] [[oil shale]] ([[kukersite]]), northern Estonia]]
Biochemical sedimentary rocks are created when organisms use materials dissolved in air or water to build their tissue. Examples include:
* Most types of [[limestone]] are formed from the calcareous skeletons of organisms such as [[coral]]s, [[mollusk]]s, and [[foraminifera]].
* [[Coal]], formed from plants that have removed [[carbon]] from the atmosphere and combined it with other elements to build their tissue.
* Deposits of [[chert]] formed from the accumulation of siliceous skeletons of microscopic organisms such as [[Radiolarian|radiolaria]] and [[diatom]]s.

===Chemical sedimentary rocks===
Chemical sedimentary rock forms when mineral constituents in [[solution]] become [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] and inorganically [[precipitate]]. Common chemical sedimentary rocks include [[Oolite|oolitic limestone]] and rocks composed of [[evaporite]] minerals, such as [[halite]] (rock salt), [[sylvite]], [[baryte]] and [[gypsum]].

===Other sedimentary rocks===
This fourth miscellaneous category includes volcanic [[tuff]] and [[Breccia#Volcanic|volcanic breccias]] formed by deposition and later cementation of lava fragments erupted by volcanoes, and [[Breccia#Impact|impact breccias]] formed after [[impact events]].

==Classification based on composition==
[[File:Cretaceous Gastropod Fossils Lebanon.jpg|thumb|[[Fossils]] of [[Nerinea]] marine [[gastropods]] of [[Late Cretaceous]] ([[Cenomanian]]) age, in [[limestone]] in [[Lebanon]].]]

Alternatively, sedimentary rocks can be subdivided into compositional groups based on their mineralogy:
* '''[[Clastic rock|Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks]]''', are dominantly composed of [[silicate minerals]]. The sediment that makes up these rocks was transported as [[Sediment transport#Bed Load|bed load]], [[Sediment transport#Suspended load|suspended load]], or by [[sediment gravity flows]]. Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks are subdivided into [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] and [[breccia]]s, [[sandstone]], and [[mudrock]]s.
* '''[[Carbonate rock|Carbonate sedimentary rocks]]''' are composed of calcite (rhombohedral {{chem|CaCO|3}}), aragonite (orthorhombic {{chem|CaCO|3}}), dolomite ({{chem|CaMg(CO|3|)|2}}), and other carbonate minerals based on the {{chem|CO|3|2-}} ion. Common examples include [[limestone]] and the rock [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]].
* '''[[Evaporite|Evaporite sedimentary rocks]]''' are composed of minerals formed from the evaporation of water. The most common evaporite minerals are [[carbonate minerals|carbonates]] (calcite and others based on {{chem|CO|3|2-}}), [[Chlorine#Occurrence|chlorides]] ([[halite]] and others built on {{chem|Cl|-}}), and [[sulfate mineral|sulfates]] ([[gypsum]] and others built on {{chem|SO|4|2-}}). Evaporite rocks commonly include abundant [[halite]] (rock salt), [[gypsum]], and [[anhydrite]].
* '''[[Organic-rich sedimentary rocks]]''' have significant amounts of organic material, generally in excess of 3% [[total organic carbon]]. Common examples include [[coal]], [[oil shale]] as well as [[source rocks]] for oil and natural gas.
* '''[[Siliceous rock|Siliceous sedimentary rocks]]''' are almost entirely composed of silica ({{chem|SiO|2}}), typically as [[chert]], [[opal]], [[chalcedony]] or other microcrystalline forms.
* '''[[Iron-rich sedimentary rocks]]''' are composed of &gt;15% iron; the most common forms are [[banded iron formation]]s and [[ironstone]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prothero&quot;/&gt;
* '''[[Phosphorite|Phosphatic sedimentary rocks]]''' are composed of phosphate minerals and contain more than 6.5% [[phosphorus]]; examples include deposits of [[phosphate nodule]]s, bone beds, and phosphatic mudrocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boggs2006&quot;/&gt;

== Deposition and transformation ==

=== Sediment transport and deposition ===
[[File:Logan Formation Cross Bedding Scour.jpg|thumb|Cross-bedding and scour in a fine [[sandstone]]; the [[Logan Formation]] ([[Mississippian age|Mississippian]]) of Jackson County, [[Ohio]]]]
Sedimentary [[rock (geology)|rocks]] are formed when [[sediment]] is [[deposition (geology)|deposited]] out of air, ice, wind, gravity, or water flows carrying the particles in [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]. This sediment is often formed when [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] break down a rock into loose material in a source area. The material is then [[Sediment transport|transported]] from the source area to the deposition area. The type of sediment transported depends on the geology of the [[hinterland]] (the source area of the sediment). However, some sedimentary rocks, such as [[evaporite]]s, are composed of material that form at the place of deposition. The nature of a sedimentary rock, therefore, not only depends on the sediment supply, but also on the [[sedimentary depositional environment]] in which it formed.

=== Transformation (Diagenesis) ===
[[File:Pressure solution sandstone.svg|thumb|[[Pressure solution]] at work in a [[clastic rock]]. While material dissolves at places where grains are in contact, that material may recrystallize from the solution and act as cement in open pore spaces. As a result, there is a net flow of material from areas under high stress to those under low stress, producing a sedimentary rock that is more compact and harder. Loose sand can become sandstone in this way.]]
{{main|diagenesis}}

The term [[diagenesis]] is used to describe all the chemical, physical, and biological changes, exclusive of surface weathering, undergone by a sediment after its initial deposition. Some of those processes cause the sediment to [[consolidation (soil)|consolidate]] into a compact, solid substance from the originally loose material. Young sedimentary rocks, especially those of [[Quaternary]] age (the most recent period of the [[geologic time scale]]) are often still unconsolidated. As sediment deposition builds up, the [[overburden pressure|overburden (lithostatic) pressure]] rises, and a process known as [[lithification]] takes place.

Sedimentary rocks are often saturated with seawater or [[groundwater]], in which minerals can dissolve, or from which minerals can [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]]. Precipitating minerals reduce the [[Porosity|pore space]] in a rock, a process called [[cementation (geology)|cementation]]. Due to the decrease in pore space, the original [[connate fluids]] are expelled. The precipitated minerals form a cement and make the rock more compact and [[Competence (geology)|competent]]. In this way, loose clasts in a sedimentary rock can become &quot;glued&quot; together.

When sedimentation continues, an older rock layer becomes buried deeper as a result. The lithostatic pressure in the rock increases due to the weight of the overlying sediment. This causes compaction, a process in which grains mechanically reorganize. Compaction is, for example, an important diagenetic process in clay, which can initially consist of 60% water. During compaction, this interstitial water is pressed out of pore spaces. Compaction can also be the result of dissolution of grains by [[pressure solution]]. The dissolved material precipitates again in open pore spaces, which means there is a net flow of material into the pores. However, in some cases, a certain mineral dissolves and does not precipitate again. This process, called [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaching]], increases pore space in the rock.

Some [[biochemistry|biochemical]] processes, like the activity of [[bacteria]], can affect minerals in a rock and are therefore seen as part of diagenesis. [[Fungi]] and [[plant]]s (by their [[root]]s) and various other organisms that live beneath the surface can also influence diagenesis.

Burial of rocks due to ongoing sedimentation leads to increased pressure and temperature, which stimulates certain chemical reactions. An example is the reactions by which [[organic material]] becomes [[lignite]] or [[coal]]. When temperature and pressure increase still further, the realm of diagenesis makes way for [[metamorphism]], the process that forms [[metamorphic rock]].

==Properties==
[[File:Banded Iron Formation Barberton.jpg|thumb|A piece of a [[banded iron formation]], a type of rock that consists of alternating layers with [[iron(III) oxide]] (red) and [[iron(II) oxide]] (grey). BIFs were mostly formed during the [[Precambrian]], when the atmosphere was not yet rich in oxygen. [[Moories Group]], [[Barberton Greenstone Belt]], [[South Africa]]]]

=== Color ===
The color of a sedimentary rock is often mostly determined by [[iron]], an element with two major oxides: [[iron(II) oxide]] and [[iron(III) oxide]]. Iron(II) oxide (FeO) only forms under low oxygen ([[Anoxic waters|anoxic]]) circumstances and gives the rock a grey or greenish colour. Iron(III) oxide (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in a richer oxygen environment is often found in the form of the mineral [[hematite]] and gives the rock a reddish to brownish colour. In arid continental climates rocks are in direct contact with the atmosphere, and oxidation is an important process, giving the rock a red or orange colour. Thick sequences of red sedimentary rocks formed in arid climates are called [[red beds]]. However, a red colour does not necessarily mean the rock formed in a continental environment or arid climate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levin_p57&quot;&gt;[[#Levin|Levin (1987)]], p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of organic material can colour a rock black or grey. Organic material is formed from dead organisms, mostly plants. Normally, such material eventually [[decomposition|decays]] by oxidation or bacterial activity. Under anoxic circumstances, however, organic material cannot decay and leaves a dark sediment, rich in organic material. This can, for example, occur at the bottom of deep seas and lakes. There is little water mixing in such environments; as a result, oxygen from surface water is not brought down, and the deposited sediment is normally a fine dark clay. Dark rocks, rich in organic material, are therefore often [[shale]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levin_p57&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tarbuck|Tarbuck &amp; Lutgens (1999)]], pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Texture ===
[[File:Sorting in sediment.svg|thumb|Diagram showing [[sorting (sediment)|well-sorted]] (left) and poorly sorted (right) grains]]

The [[grain size|size]], form and orientation of clasts (the original pieces of rock) in a sediment is called its [[texture (geology)|texture]]. The texture is a small-scale property of a rock, but determines many of its large-scale properties, such as the [[density]], [[porosity]] or [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boggs1987|Boggs (1987)]], p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3D orientation of the clasts is called the [[fabric]] of the rock. Between the clasts, the rock can be composed of a [[matrix (geology)|matrix]] (a cement) that consists of crystals of one or more precipitated minerals. The size and form of clasts can be used to determine the velocity and direction of [[current (stream)|current]] in the sedimentary environment that moved the clasts from their origin; fine, [[calcareous mud]] only settles in quiet water while gravel and larger clasts are moved only by rapidly moving water.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tarbuck|Tarbuck &amp; Lutgens (1999)]], pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levin|Levin (1987)]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The grain size of a rock is usually expressed with the [[Wentworth scale]], though alternative scales are sometimes used. The grain size can be expressed as a diameter or a volume, and is always an average value&amp;nbsp;– a rock is composed of clasts with different sizes. The [[Distribution (mathematics)|statistical distribution]] of grain sizes is different for different rock types and is described in a property called the [[sorting (sediment)|sorting]] of the rock. When all clasts are more or less of the same size, the rock is called 'well-sorted', and when there is a large spread in grain size, the rock is called 'poorly sorted'.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boggs1987|Boggs (1987)]], pp. 112–115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blatt|Blatt ''et al.''

Regardless of age or gender, this day is also an opportunity to reaffirm that traditional filial piety is a crucial norm and cultural value in modern society. The ceremony to mark Parents' Day as an anniversary and put on carnations stems from a Christian culture. As Western religions and cultures entered, this holiday, which was introduced together, became the most traditional holiday combined with Confucian filial piety in the process of establishing itself.

===Taiwan===
{{Main|Public holidays in Taiwan}}

In [[Taiwan]], Father's Day is not an official holiday, but is widely observed on August 8, the eighth day of the eighth month of the year. In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], the pronunciation of the number eight is ''bā'', and the pronunciation is very similar to the character {{Lang-zh|c=爸|s=|t=|labels=no|p=}} (''bà''), which means &quot;Pa&quot; or &quot;dad&quot;. The eighth day of the eighth month ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=|p=bā-bā|labels=no}}) is a pun for dad ({{Lang-zh|c=爸爸|s=|t=|p=bàba|labels=no}}).  The Taiwanese, therefore, sometimes refer to August 8 as &quot;Bābā Holiday&quot; as a pun for &quot;Dad's Holiday&quot; ({{Lang-zh|c=爸爸節|s=|t=|labels=no}}) or the more formal &quot;Father's Day&quot; ({{Lang-zh|c=父親節|s=|t=|labels=no|p=}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Father's Day in Taiwan|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/taiwan/fathers-day|access-date=2020-06-26|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
In [[Thailand]], the birthday of the king, is set as Father's Day.&lt;ref name=&quot;smiles&quot; /&gt; December 5 is the birthday of the late king [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] (Rama IX). Traditionally, Thais celebrate by giving their father or grandfather a [[Canna (plant)|canna]] flower ({{Lang-th|ดอกพุทธรักษา|translit=Dok Buddha Raksa|label=none}}), which is considered a masculine flower; however, this is not as commonly practiced today. Thai people will wear yellow on this day to show respect for the late king, because yellow is the [[color of the day]] for Monday, the day King Bhumibol Adulyadej was born. Thais flood the [[Sanam Luang]], a massive park in front of the palace, to watch the king give his annual speech, and often stay until the evening, when there is a national ceremony. Thais will light candles and show respect to the king by declaring their faith. This ceremony happens in almost every village in Thailand, and even overseas at Thai organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-12-04|title=King Bhumibol's Birthday and Father's Day in Thailand|url=https://www.expique.com/article/fathers-day-kings-birthday-thailand/|access-date=2020-06-26|website=Experience Unique Bangkok|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their slogan « Nos papas nous l'ont dit, pour la fête des pères, ils désirent tous un Flaminaire » (Our daddies told us, for father's day, they all want a Flaminaire). In 1952, the holiday was officially decreed. A national father's day committee was set up to give a prize for fathers that deserved it most (originally, candidates were nominated by the social services of each town hall's/mayor's office); This complements &quot;la Fête des Mères&quot; (Mother's day) which was made official in France in 1928 and added to the calendar in Vichy in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Father's Day in France|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/france/father-day#:~:text=Father%27s%20Day%20is%20not%20a,third%20Sunday%20June%20in%20France.|access-date=2020-06-30|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because this day is new to the country it does not have established unique traditions, but people borrow ideas from other country's Father's Day traditions to congratulate fathers in Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Fathers' Day in Latvia|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/latvia/fathers-day|access-date=2020-06-30|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''A'' is the amplitude of the source wave
: &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavenumber]]
: ''S'' is the unobstructed surface.

The first term outside of the integral represents the oscillations from the source wave at a distance ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, the term inside the integral represents the oscillations from the secondary wavelets at distances ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

In order to derive the intensity behind the circular obstacle using this integral one assumes that the experimental parameters fulfill the requirements of the [[Fresnel diffraction|near-field diffraction]] regime (the size of the circular obstacle is large compared to the wavelength and small compared to the distances ''g''=P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;C and ''b''=CP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Going to [[polar coordinates]] then yields the integral for a circular object of radius a (see for example Born and Wolf&lt;ref name=&quot;bornwolf&quot;/&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;
U(P_1) = - \frac{\mathbf{i}}{\lambda}  \frac{A e^{\mathbf{i} k (g+b)}}{g b}  2\pi \int_a^\infty  e^{\mathbf{i} k \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{g} + \frac{1}{b}\right)r^2} r \, dr.
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:poissonspotintensity.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The on-axis intensity at the center of the shadow of a small circular obstacle converges to the unobstructed intensity.]]

This integral can be solved numerically (see below). If ''g'' is large and ''b'' is small so that the angle &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; is not negligible one can write the integral for the on-axis case (P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is at the center of the shadow) as (see &lt;ref name=&quot;sommerfeldp186&quot;/&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;
U(P_1) = \frac{A e^{\mathbf{i} k g}}{g} \frac{b}{\sqrt{b^2+a^2}}  e^{\mathbf{i} k \sqrt{b^2+a^2}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The source [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]], which is the square of the field amplitude, is  &lt;math&gt;I_0=\left|\frac{A e^{\mathbf{i} k g}}{g}\right|^2&lt;/math&gt; and the intensity at the screen &lt;math&gt;I = \left | U(P_1) \right |^2&lt;/math&gt;. The on-axis intensity as a function of the distance ''b'' is hence given by:

:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{b^2}{b^2+a^2} I_0.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that the on-axis intensity at the center of the shadow tends to the source intensity, as if the circular object was not present at all. Furthermore, this means that the Arago spot is present even just a few obstacle diameters behind the disc.

===Calculation of diffraction images===

To calculate the full diffraction image that is visible on the screen one has to consider the surface integral of the previous section. One cannot exploit circular symmetry anymore, since the line between the source and an arbitrary point on the screen does not pass through the center of the circular object. With the aperture function &lt;math&gt;g(r,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; which is 1 for transparent parts of the object plane and 0 otherwise (i.e. It is 0 if the direct line between source and the point on the screen passes through the blocking circular object.) the integral that needs to be solved is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
U(P_1) \propto  \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\infty g(r,\theta) e^{\frac{\mathbf{i} \pi \rho^2}{\lambda} \left( \frac{1}{g} + \frac{1}{b} \right)}  \rho \, d\rho \, d\theta.
&lt;/math&gt;

Numerical calculation of the integral using the [[trapezoidal rule]] or [[Simpson's rule]] is not efficient and becomes numerically unstable especially for configurations with large [[Fresnel number]]. However, it is possible to solve the radial part of the integral so that only the integration over the azimuth angle remains to be done numerically.&lt;ref name=&quot;dauger&quot;/&gt; For a particular angle one must solve the line integral for the ray with origin at the intersection point of the line P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with the circular object plane. The contribution for a particular ray with azimuth angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; and passing a transparent part of the object plane from &lt;math&gt;r=s&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;r=t&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;
R(\theta_1) \propto e^{\pi \mathbf{i} s^2/2} - e^{\pi \mathbf{i} t^2/2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

So for each angle one has to compute the intersection point(''s'') of the ray with the circular object and then sum the contributions &lt;math&gt;I(\theta_1)&lt;/math&gt; for a certain number of angles between 0 and &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. Results of such a calculation are shown in the following images.

The images show simulated Arago spots in the shadow of a disc of varying diameter (4&amp;nbsp;mm, 2&amp;nbsp;mm, 1&amp;nbsp;mm – left to right) at a distance of 1&amp;nbsp;m from the disc. The point source has a wavelength of 633&amp;nbsp;nm (e.g. He-Ne Laser) and is located 1&amp;nbsp;m from the disc. The image width corresponds to 16&amp;nbsp;mm.

==Experimental aspects==
===Intensity and size===

For an ideal [[point source]], the intensity of the Arago spot equals that of the undisturbed [[wave front]]. Only the width of the Arago spot intensity peak depends on the distances between source, circular object and screen, as well as the source's wavelength and the diameter of the circular object. &lt;!--The shape of the Poisson spot's intensity distribution will in fact be similar for experimental setups with the same Fresnel number.--&gt; This means that one can compensate for a reduction in the source's [[wavelength]] by increasing the distance l between circular object and screen or reducing the circular object's diameter.

The lateral intensity distribution on the screen has in fact the shape of a squared [[Bessel function|zeroth Bessel function of the first kind]] when close to the [[optical axis]] and using a [[plane wave|plane wave source]] (point source at infinity):&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey1984&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
U(P_1,r) \propto  J_0^2 \left(\frac{\pi r d}{\lambda b}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
: ''r'' is the distance of the point ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the screen from the optical axis
: ''d'' is the diameter of circular object
: ''&amp;lambda;'' is the wavelength
: ''b'' is the distance between circular object and screen.

The following images show the radial intensity distribution of the simulated Arago spot images above:

[[File:poissonspot simulation d4mm lateral.jpg|200px]]
[[File:poissonspot simulation d2mm lateral.jpg|200px]]
[[File:poissonspot simulation d1mm lateral.jpg|200px]]

The red lines in these three graphs correspond to the simulated images above, and the green lines were computed by applying the corresponding parameters to the squared Bessel function given above.

===Finite source size and spatial coherence===

The main reason why the Arago spot is hard to observe in circular shadows from conventional light sources is that such light sources are bad approximations of point sources. If the wave source has a finite size ''S'' then the Arago spot will have an extent that is given by ''S''×''b''/''g'', as if the circular object acted like a lens.&lt;ref name=&quot;sommerfeld&quot;/&gt; At the same time the intensity of the Arago spot is reduced with respect to the intensity of the undisturbed wave front. Defining the relative intensity &lt;math&gt;I_{rel}&lt;/math&gt;as the intensity divided by the intensity of the undisturbed wavefront, the relative intensity for an extended circular source of diameter w can be expressed exactly using the following equation:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reisinger|first=T|last2=Leufke|first2=P M|last3=Gleiter|first3=H|last4=Hahn|first4=H|date=2017-03-14|title=On the relative intensity of Poisson's spot|journal=New Journal of Physics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=033022|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/aa5e7f|issn=1367-2630|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
I_{rel}(w) = J_0^2(\frac{w R \pi}{g \lambda} ) + J_1^2(\frac{w R \pi}{g \lambda})
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_0&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt;are the Bessel functions of the first kind. R is the radius of the disc casting the shadow, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;the wavelength and ''g'' the distance between source and disc. For large sources the following asymptotic approximation applies:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
I_{rel}(w) \approx \frac{2 g \lambda }{\pi^2 w R}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Deviation from circularity===

If the cross-section of the circular object deviates slightly from its circular shape (but it still has a sharp edge on a smaller scale) the shape of the point-source Arago spot changes. In particular, if the object has an ellipsoidal cross-section the Arago spot has the shape of an [[evolute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coulson1922&quot;/&gt; Note that this is only the case if the source is close to an ideal point source. From an extended source the Arago spot is only affected marginally, since one can interpret the Arago spot as a [[point-spread function]]. Therefore, the image of the extended source only becomes washed out due to the convolution with the point-spread function, but it does not decrease in over all intensity.

===The circular object's surface roughness===

The Arago spot is very sensitive to small-scale deviations from the ideal circular cross-section. This means that a small amount of surface roughness of the circular object can completely cancel out the bright spot. This is shown in the following three diagrams which are simulations of the Arago spot from a 4&amp;nbsp;mm diameter disc (''g''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;m):

[[File:poissonspot simulation d4mm lateral cor10.jpg|200px]]
[[File:poissonspot simulation d4mm lateral cor50.jpg|200px]]
[[File:poissonspot simulation d4mm lateral cor100.jpg|200px]]

The simulation includes a regular sinusoidal corrugation of the circular shape of amplitude 10&amp;nbsp;μm, 50&amp;nbsp;μm and 100&amp;nbsp;μm, respectively. Note, that the 100&amp;nbsp;μm edge corrugation almost completely removes the central bright spot.

This effect can be best understood using the [[Fresnel zone|Fresnel zone concept]]. The field transmitted by a radial segment that stems from a point on the obstacle edge provides a contribution whose phase is tight to the position of the edge point relative to Fresnel zones. If the variance in the radius of the obstacle are much smaller than the width of Fresnel zone near the edge, the contributions form radial segments are approximately in phase and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] constructively. However, if random edge corrugation have amplitude comparable to or greater than the width of that adjacent Fresnel zone, the contributions from radial segments are no longer in phase and cancel each other reducing the Arago spot intensity.

The adjacent Fresnel zone is approximately given by:&lt;ref name=&quot;reisinger2009&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta r \approx \sqrt{r^2 + \lambda \frac{g b}{g+b}} - r.
&lt;/math&gt;

The edge corrugation should not be much more than 10% of this width to see a close to ideal Arago spot. In the above simulations with the 4&amp;nbsp;mm diameter disc the adjacent Fresnel zone has a width of about 77&amp;nbsp;μm.

==Arago spot with matter waves==

In 2009, the Arago spot experiment was demonstrated with a supersonic expansion beam of [[deuterium]] molecules (an example of neutral [[matter waves]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;reisinger2009&quot;/&gt; Material particles behaving like waves is known from [[quantum mechanics]]. The wave-nature of particles actually dates back to [[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie's]] hypothesis&lt;ref name=&quot;debroglie&quot;/&gt; as well as [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson and Germer's experiments]].&lt;ref name=&quot;davisson&quot;/&gt; An Arago spot of electrons, which also constitute matter waves, can be observed in [[transmission electron microscope]]s when examining circular structures of a certain size.

The observation of an Arago spot with large molecules, thus proving their wave-nature, is a topic of current research.&lt;ref name=&quot;reisinger2009&quot;/&gt;

==Other applications==

Beside the demonstration of wave-behavior, the Arago spot also has a few other applications. One of the ideas is to use the Arago spot as a straight line reference in alignment systems (see [http://www.slac.stanford.edu/econf/C971013/papers/047.PDF Feier et al.]). Another is to probe aberrations in laser beams by using the spot's sensitivity to beam [[optical aberration|aberrations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey1984&quot;/&gt;  Finally, the [[aragoscope]] has been proposed as a method for dramatically improving the diffraction-limited resolution of space-based telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aragoscope: Ultra-High Resolution Optics at Low Cost|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/the-aragoscope-ultra-high-resolution-optics-at-low-cost/#.U5givlKSz8s|website=NASA|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/today/2015/01/23/new-space-telescope-concept-could-image-objects-far-higher-resolution-hubble|website=CU Bolder Today|accessdate=9 February 2017|title=New space telescope concept could image objects at far higher resolution than Hubble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mantua''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|n|tj|u|ə}}; {{lang-it|Mantova}} {{IPA-it|ˈmantova||It-Mantova.ogg}}; [[Lombard language|Lombard]] and {{lang-la|Mantua}}) is a city and ''[[comune]]'' in [[Lombardy]], Italy, and capital of the [[Province of Mantua|province of the same name]].

In 2016, Mantua was designated as the Italian Capital of Culture. In 2017, it was named as the European Capital of Gastronomy, included in the Eastern Lombardy District (together with the cities of [[Bergamo]], [[Brescia]], and [[Cremona]]).

In 2006, Mantua's ''centro storico'' (old town) and [[Sabbioneta]] were declared by [[UNESCO]] to be a [[World Heritage Site]]. Mantua's historic power and influence under the [[Gonzaga family]] has made it one of the main artistic, [[culture|cultural]], and especially musical hubs of Northern Italy and the country as a whole. Having one of the most splendid courts of  Europe of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and early seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mantua {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/spain-portugal-italy-greece-and-balkans/italian-political-geography/mantua|access-date=2020-10-07|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mantua is noted for its significant role in the history of [[opera]]; the city is also known for its architectural treasures and artifacts, elegant palaces, and the medieval and [[Renaissance]] cityscape. It is the city where the composer [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]] premiered his opera ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' and to where [[Romeo]] was banished in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. It is the nearest town to the birthplace of the Roman poet [[Virgil]], who is commemorated by a statue at the lakeside park &quot;Piazza Virgiliana&quot;.

Mantua is surrounded on three sides by artificial [[lake]]s, created during the 12th century as the city's defence system. These lakes receive water from the [[Mincio]] River, a tributary of the [[Po (river)|Po]] River which descends from [[Lake Garda]]. The three lakes are called ''Lago Superiore'', ''Lago di Mezzo'', and ''Lago Inferiore'' (&quot;Upper&quot;, &quot;Middle&quot;, and &quot;Lower&quot; Lakes, respectively). A fourth lake, Lake Pajolo, which once served as a defensive water ring around the city, dried up at the end of the 18th century.

The area and its environs are important not only in naturalistic terms, but also [[anthropology|anthropologically]] and historically; research has highlighted a number of human settlements scattered between Barche di [[Solferino]] and Bande di [[Cavriana]], Castellaro and Isolone del Mincio. These dated, without interruption, from [[Neolithic]] times (5th–4th millennium BC) to the [[Bronze Age]] (2nd–1st millennium BC) and the [[Gauls|Gallic]] phases (2nd–1st centuries BC), and ended with Roman residential settlements, which could be traced to the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century AD.

In 2017, [[Legambiente]] ranked Mantua as the best Italian city for the quality of the life and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legambiente.it/ecosistema-urbano/|title=Ecosistema Urbano ⋆ Legambiente|date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Mantua|Duchy of Mantua}}

Mantua was an island settlement which was first established about the year 2000 BC on the banks of River [[Mincio]], which flows from [[Lake Garda]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In the 6th century BC, Mantua was an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] village which, in the Etruscan tradition, was re-founded by [[Ocnus]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagles, Robert, ed.: ''The Aeneid'' (2006), 10.242, Penguin Group, {{ISBN|0-670-03803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucchini, Daniele: ''Rise and fall of a capital. The history of Mantua in the words of who wrote about it'' (2013), {{ISBN|978-1-291-78388-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name may derive from the Etruscan god [[Mantus]]. After being conquered by the [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Cenomani]], a [[Gaul|Gallic]] tribe, Mantua was subsequently fought between the first and second [[Punic wars]] against the [[Rome|Romans]], who attributed its name to [[Manto (mythology)|Manto]], a daughter of [[Tiresias]]. This territory was later populated by veteran soldiers of [[Augustus]]. Mantua's most famous ancient citizen is the poet [[Virgil]], or Publius Vergilius Maro (''Mantua me genuit''), who was born in the year 70 BC at a village near the city which is now known as Virgilio.&lt;ref&gt;Conte, Gian Biagio. Trans. Joseph B. Solodow ''Latin Literature: A History'' Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the Fall of the Roman Empire===
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] at the hands of [[Odoacer]] in 476&amp;nbsp;AD, Mantua was, along with the rest of Italy, conquered by the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogoths]]. It was retaken by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] in the middle of the 6th century following the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic war]] but was subsequently lost again to the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombards]]. They were in turn conquered by [[Charlemagne]] in 774, thus incorporating Mantua into the [[Frankish Empire]]. Partitions of the empire (due to the Franks' use of [[partible inheritance]]) in the [[Treaty of Verdun|Treaties of Verdun]] and [[Treaty of Prüm|Prüm]] led to Mantua passing to [[Middle Francia]] in 843, then the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 855. In 962 Italy was invaded by King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]], and Mantua thus became a vassal of the newly formed [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In the 11th century, Mantua became a possession of [[Boniface of Canossa]], [[Marquess|marquis]] of [[March of Tuscany|Tuscany]]. The last ruler of that family was the countess [[Matilda of Tuscany|Matilda of Canossa]] (d. 1115), who, according to legend, ordered the construction of the precious [[Rotonda di San Lorenzo]] (or St. Lawrence's Roundchurch) in 1082. The Rotonda still exists today and was renovated in 2013.

==== Free Imperial City of Mantua ====
After the death of Matilda of Canossa, Mantua became a [[Free Imperial City|free]] [[medieval commune|commune]] and strenuously defended itself from the influence of the Holy Roman Empire during the 12th and 13th centuries. In 1198, Alberto Pitentino altered the course of River Mincio, creating what the Mantuans call &quot;the four lakes&quot; to reinforce the city's natural protection. Three of these lakes still remain today and the fourth one, which ran through the centre of town, was reclaimed during the 18th century.

====Podesteria Rule====

From 1215, the city was ruled under the ''[[podestà|podesteria]]'' of the Guelph poet-statesman [[Rambertino Buvalelli]].
[[File:Domenico morone, la cacciata dei bonacolsi da mantova, 1494.jpg|thumb|left|''Expulsion of the Bonacolsi in 1328, scene of Piazza Sordello'', canvas of [[Domenico Morone]].]]

During the struggle between the Guelphs and the [[Ghibellines]], Pinamonte Bonacolsi took advantage of the chaotic situation to seize power of the podesteria in 1273. He was declared the ''Captain General of the People''. The [[Bonacolsi]] family ruled Mantua for the next two generations and made it more prosperous and artistically beautiful. On August 16, 1328, Luigi Gonzaga, an official in Bonacolsi's podesteria, and his family staged a public revolt in Mantua and forced a [[coup d'état]] on the last Bonacolsi ruler, Rinaldo.

===House of Gonzaga===

Ludovico Gonzaga, who had been [[Podestà]] of Mantua since 1318, was duly elected '''Captain General of the People'''. The Gonzagas built new walls with five gates and renovated the city in the 14th century; however, the political situation did not settle until the third ruler of Gonzaga, [[Ludovico III Gonzaga]], who eliminated his relatives and centralised power to himself. During the Italian Renaissance, the Gonzaga family softened their despotic rule and further raised the level of culture and refinement in Mantua.&lt;ref&gt;Henry S. Lucas, ''The Renaissance and the Reformation'' (Harper &amp; Bros. Publishers: New York, 1960) pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Mantua became a significant center of Renaissance art and humanism. Marquis [[Gianfrancesco Gonzaga]] had brought [[Vittorino da Feltre]] to Mantua in 1423 to open his famous humanist school, the Casa Giocosa.

[[Isabella d'Este]], Marchioness of Mantua, married Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of [[March of Mantua|Mantua]] in 1490. When she moved to Mantua from [[Ferrara]] (she was the daughter of [[Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Duke Ercole]] the ruler of [[Duchy of Ferrara|Ferrara]]) she created her famous [[studiolo]] firstly in [[Castello di San Giorgio]] for which she commissioned paintings from [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Perugino]] and [[Lorenzo Costa]]. She later moved her studiolo to the Corte Vecchia and commissioned two paintings from [[Correggio]] to join the five from Castello di San Giorgio. It was unusual for a woman to have a studiolo in 15th century Italy given they were regarded as masculine spaces. Isabella was a vociferous collector and such was her reputation that Niccolò da Corregio called her 'la prima donna del mondo'.

[[File:Palazzo Te Mantova 4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo del Te|Palazzo Te]].]]

Through a payment of 120,000 golden [[Italian coin florin|florins]] in 1433, [[Gianfrancesco I Gonzaga|Gianfrancesco I]] was appointed Marquis of Mantua by the [[Emperor Sigismund]], whose niece [[Barbara of Brandenburg, Marquise of Mantua|Barbara of Brandenburg]] married his son, Ludovico. In 1459, [[Pope Pius II]] held the [[Council of Mantua (1459)|Council of Mantua]] to proclaim a crusade against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. Under Ludovico and his heirs, the famous [[Renaissance]] painter [[Andrea Mantegna]] worked in Mantua as court painter, producing some of his most outstanding works.

====Duchy of Mantua====

The first Duke of [[Duchy of Mantua|Mantua]] was [[Federico II Gonzaga]], who acquired the title from the Holy Roman Emperor [[Emperor Charles V|Charles V]] in 1530. Federico commissioned [[Giulio Romano]] to build the famous [[Palazzo Te]], on the periphery of the city, and profoundly improved the city. In the late 16th century, [[Claudio Monteverdi]] came to Mantua from his native Cremona. He worked for the court of [[Vincenzo I Gonzaga]], first as a singer and violist, then as music director, marrying the court singer Claudia Cattaneo in 1599.

===From Gonzaga to Habsburg===

In 1627, the direct line of the Gonzaga family came to an end with the vicious and weak [[Vincenzo II Gonzaga|Vincenzo II]], and Mantua slowly declined under the new rulers, the [[Charles Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua and Montferrat|Gonzaga-Nevers]], a cadet French branch of the family. The [[War of the Mantuan Succession]] broke out, and in 1630 an [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] army of 36,000 [[Landsknecht]] mercenaries besieged Mantua, bringing the plague with them. [[Charles IV, Duke of Mantua|Ferdinand Carlo IV]], an inept ruler, whose only interest was in holding parties and theatrical shows, allied with France in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. After the French defeat, he took refuge in [[Venice]] and carried with him a thousand pictures. At his death in 1708, the Duke of Mantua was declared deposed and his family of Gonzaga lost Mantua forever in favour of the [[Habsburg]]s of Austria.

Under Austrian rule, Mantua enjoyed a revival and during this period the Royal Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts, the Scientific Theatre, and numerous palaces were built.

====Napoleonic Wars====

In 1786, ten years before [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s campaign of Europe, the Austrian Duchy of Mantua briefly united with the [[Duchy of Milan]] until 1791.

On June 4, 1796, Mantua was [[Siege of Mantua (1796–97)|besieged]] by Napoleon's army as a move against Austria, who had joined the [[First Coalition|First Coalition against France]]. Austrian and Russian attempts to break the siege failed, but they were able to spread the French forces thinly enough that the siege was abandoned on 31 July. After diverting the French forces elsewhere, the French resumed the siege on August 24. In early February 1797, the city surrendered and the region came under French administration. Two years later, in 1799, the city was recaptured by the Austrians after the [[Siege of Mantua (1799)]].

Later, the city again passed into Napoleon's control and became a part of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy. In 1810 [[Andreas Hofer]] was shot by Porta Giulia, a gate of the town at Borgo di Porto (Cittadella) for leading the insurrection in the [[County of Tyrol]] against Napoleon.

====Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia====

After the brief period of French rule, Mantua returned to Austria in 1814, becoming one of the [[Quadrilatero]] fortress cities in northern Italy. Under the [[Congress of Vienna (1815)]], Mantua became a province in the Austrian Empire's [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]]. Agitation against Austria, however, culminated in a revolt which lasted from 1851 to 1855, but it was finally suppressed by the Austrian army. One of the most famous episodes of the Italian [[Risorgimento]] took place in the valley of the Belfiore, where a group of rebels was hanged by the Austrians.

===Unification of Italy===

At the [[Battle of Solferino]] ([[Second Italian War of Independence]]) in 1859, the [[House of Savoy]]'s Piedmont-Sardinia sided with the French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] against the Austrian Empire. Following Austria's defeat, Lombardy was ceded to France, who transferred Lombardy to Piedmont-Sardinia in return for [[Nice]] and [[Savoy]].

Mantua, although a constituent province of Lombardy, still remained under the Austrian Empire along with Venetia. In 1866, Prussia-led [[North German Confederation]] sided with the newly established, Piedmont-led Kingdom of Italy against the Austrian Empire in the [[Third Italian War of Independence]]. The quick defeat of Austria led to its withdrawal of the Kingdom of Venetia (including the capital city, [[Venice]]). Mantua reconnected with the region of Lombardy and was incorporated into the [[Italian Unification|Kingdom of Italy]].

The Gonzagas protected the arts and culture, and were hosts to several important artists such as [[Leone Battista Alberti]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Giulio Romano]], [[Donatello]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Pisanello]], [[Domenico Fetti]], [[Luca Fancelli]] and Nicolò Sebregondi. Though many of the masterworks have been dispersed, the cultural value of Mantua is nonetheless outstanding, with many of Mantua's patrician and ecclesiastical buildings being uniquely important examples of Italian architecture.

==Miscellaneous==
* An annual survey of Legambiente (an ecologist movement of Italy) in 2005 declared Mantua the most 'liveable' city of the country. The study was based on levels of pollution, quality of life, traffic, and public transport, among other criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.corriere.it/english/articoli/2005/11_Novembre/22/mantova.shtml|title=Corriere.it|website=www.corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The body of [[Saint Longinus]], twice recovered and lost, was asserted to have been found once more at Mantua in 1304, together with the Holy Sponge stained with Christ's blood.
* The composer [[Claudio Monteverdi]] was employed by [[Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]], ruler of the [[Duchy of Mantua]], when he wrote the ''[[Vespro della Beata Vergine]]'', published in 1610.

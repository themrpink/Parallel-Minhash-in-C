==Economy==

The three spires are: [[Holy Trinity Church, Coventry|Holy Trinity]] (left), remaining spire of the ruined (bombed) [[Coventry Cathedral|cathedral]] and the remaining spire of the ruined Christ Church (right).]]

Historically Coventry was the most important seat of ribbon-making in the UK. In this industry it competed locally with Norwich and Leicester and internationally with [[St Etienne]] in France.

Coventry has been a centre of motor and cycle manufacturing from 1896.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Starting with [[The Coventry Motor Company|Coventry Motette]], [[The Great Horseless Carriage Company]], [[Swift Motor Company]], [[Humber Limited|Humber]], [[Hillman]], [[Riley (automobile)|Riley]], [[Francis-Barnett]] and [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] and the [[Triumph Motorcycles Ltd|Triumph motorcycle]] having its origins in 1902 in a Coventry factory. The [[Massey-Ferguson]] tractor factory was situated on [[Banner Lane]], [[Tile Hill]], until it closed in the late 1990s.

Although the motor industry has declined almost to the point of extinction, the [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]
company has retained its corporate headquarters in the city (at Whitley) and an Advanced R&amp;D team at the University of Warwick, while [[Peugeot]] still have a large parts centre in Humber Road despite the closure of its [[Ryton plant|Ryton factory]] (formerly owned by the [[Rootes Group]]) just outside the city in December 2006 with the loss of more than 2,000 jobs - denting the economy of Coventry shortly before the onset of a [[Late 2000s recession|recession]] which sparked further economic decline and high unemployment.

The [[Standard Motor Company]] opened a car factory at [[Canley]] in the south of the city in 1918, occupying a former munitions factory. This site was later expanded and produced Triumph cars after the Standard brand was phased out by [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] during the 1960s. In August 1980, however, it was closed down as part of [[British Leyland|British Leyland's]] rationalisation process, although the Triumph brand survived for another four years on cars produced at other British Leyland factories. The closure of the Triumph car factory was perhaps the largest blow to Coventry's economy during the early 1980s economic decline.

The famous London [[Hackney carriage|black cab taxis]] are produced in Coventry by [[London Taxis International|LTI]] and these are now the only vehicles still wholly built in Coventry.

The manufacture of [[machine tools]] was once a major industry in Coventry. [[Alfred Herbert (company)|Alfred Herbert Ltd]] became one of the largest machine tool companies in the world. In later years the company faced competition from foreign machine tool builders and ceased trading in 1983. Other Coventry machine tool manufacturers included A.C. Wickman, and Webster &amp; Bennett. The last Coventry machine tool manufacturer was [[Arms-to-Iraq|Matrix Churchill]] which was forced to close in the wake of the [[Project Babylon|Iraqi Supergun (Project Babylon)]] scandal.

Coventry's main industries include: cars, electronic equipment, machine tools, agricultural machinery, man-made fibres, aerospace components and telecommunications equipment. In recent years, the city has moved away from manufacturing industries towards business services, finance, research, design and development, creative industries as well as logistics and leisure.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Major improvements continue to regenerate the city centre. The Phoenix Initiative, which was designed by [[MJP Architects]], reached the final shortlist for the 2004 [[Stirling Prize|RIBA Stirling Prize]] and has now won a total of 16 separate awards. It was published in the book 'Phoenix : Architecture/Art/Regeneration' in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoenix&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackdogonline.com/all-books/phoenix.html|title=Phoenix : Architecture/Art/Regeneration|accessdate=27 August 2009|year=2004|work=Black Dog Publishing|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708012456/http://blackdogonline.com/all-books/phoenix.html|archivedate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further major developments are potentially afoot, particularly the Swanswell Project, which is intended to deepen Swanswell Pool and link it to [[Coventry Canal#Coventry Canal Basin|Coventry Canal Basin]], coupled with the creation of an urban marina and a wide Parisian-style boulevard. A possible second phase of the Phoenix Initiative is also in the offing, although both of these plans are still on the drawing-board. On 16 December 2007, [[IKEA]]'s first city centre store in the UK was opened, in Coventry.&lt;ref name=&quot;ikeapress&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/press_room/press_release/national/southampton_opening.html|title=IKEA set to open City Centre Store in Southampton|publisher=[[IKEA]]|accessdate=17 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924162920/http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/press_room/press_release/national/southampton_opening.html|archive-date=24 September 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shopping&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcoventryandwarwickshire.co.uk/shopping/coventry.aspx|title=Shopping in Coventry|work=visitcoventryandwarwickshire.co.uk|publisher=Coventry City Council|accessdate=17 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404090031/http://www.visitcoventryandwarwickshire.co.uk/shopping/coventry.aspx|archive-date=4 April 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[River Sherbourne]] runs under Coventry's city centre; the river was paved over during the rebuilding after the Second World War and is not commonly known. When the new rebuild of Coventry city centre takes place from 2017 onwards, it is planned that river will be re-opened, and a river walk way will be placed alongside it in parts of the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Electricity ===
Electricity was first supplied to Coventry in 1895 from [[Coventry power stations|Coventry power station]] off Sandy Lane adjacent to the canal (now Electric Wharf). A larger 130&amp;nbsp;MW power station was built at Longford in 1928, this operated until 1976, and was subsequently demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The City of Coventry - water, gas and electricity|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/warks/vol8/pp275-298#h3-0005|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 October 2020|website=British history online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste management===

==Transport==

===Road===

Coventry is near the [[M1 motorway|M1]], [[M6 motorway|M6]], [[M40 motorway|M40]], [[M45 motorway|M45]] and [[M69 motorway]]s. The M45, which is situated a few miles to the south-east of the city, was opened in 1959 as a spur to the original section of the [[M1 motorway]], which linked [[London]] with the Midlands. This was, in effect, the first motorway to serve Coventry, as the section of the M6 north of the city did not open until 1971 and the M69 between Coventry and [[Leicester]] opened five years later. The M40, which is connected to the city via the [[A46 road|A46]], is more than {{convert|10|mi|abbr=off}} south of the city centre, south of [[Warwick]] and gives the city's residents an alternative dual carriageway and motorway route to London.

It is served by the [[A45 road|A45]] and [[A46 road|A46]] dual carriageways. The A45 originally passed through the centre of the city, but was re-routed in the 1930s on the completion of the Coventry Southern By-pass, with westbound traffic heading in the direction of [[Birmingham]] and eastbound traffic in the direction of [[Northampton]]. The A46 was re-routed to the east of the city in 1989 on completion of the Coventry Eastern Bypass, which directly leads to the M6/M69 interchange. To the south, it gives a direct link to the M40, making use of the existing Warwick and [[Kenilworth]] by-passes.

Coventry has an inner [[A4053 road|ring road]] which was completed in the early 1970s and [[Phoenix Way (road)|Phoenix Way]], a dual-carriageway running north–south completed in 1995, linking the city centre with the M6 motorway.

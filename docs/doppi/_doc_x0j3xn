In short, similar differences in width are observed for all interval types, except for unisons and octaves, and they are all multiples of ε, the difference between the Pythagorean fifth and the average fifth.

Notice that, as an obvious consequence, each augmented or diminished interval is exactly 12ε (≈ 23.460) cents narrower or wider than its enharmonic equivalent. For instance, the d6 (or wolf fifth) is 12ε cents narrower than each P5, and each A2 is 12ε cents wider than each m3. This interval of size 12ε is known as a [[Pythagorean comma]], exactly equal to the opposite of a [[diminished second]] (≈ &amp;minus;23.460 cents). This implies that ε can be also defined as one twelfth of a Pythagorean comma.

{{Main|Pythagorean interval|Interval (music)}}
Four of the above-mentioned intervals take a specific name in Pythagorean tuning. In the following table, these specific names are provided, together with alternative names used generically for some other intervals. Notice that the Pythagorean comma does not coincide with the diminished second, as its size (524288:531441) is the reciprocal of the Pythagorean diminished second (531441:524288). Also ''ditone'' and ''semiditone'' are specific for Pythagorean tuning, while ''tone'' and ''tritone'' are used generically for all tuning systems. Despite its name, a semiditone (3 semitones, or about 300 cents) can hardly be viewed as half of a ditone (4 semitones, or about 400 cents). All the intervals with prefix ''sesqui-'' are [[just intonation|justly]] tuned, and their [[Interval ratio|frequency ratio]], shown in the table, is a [[superparticular number]] (or epimoric ratio). The same is true for the octave.

==History and usage==
Because of the [[wolf interval]] when using a 12-tone Pythagorean temperament, this tuning is rarely used today, although it is thought to have been widespread. In music which does not change [[key (music)|key]] very often, or which is not very [[harmony|harmonically]] adventurous, the wolf interval is unlikely to be a problem, as not all the possible fifths will be heard in such pieces. In extended Pythagorean tuning there is no wolf interval, all perfect fifths are exactly 3:2.

Because most fifths in 12-tone Pythagorean temperament are in the simple ratio of 3:2, they sound very &quot;smooth&quot; and consonant. The thirds, by contrast, most of which are in the relatively complex ratios of 81:64 (for major thirds) and 32:27 (for minor thirds), sound less smooth depending on the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;However, 3/2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; is described as &quot;almost exactly a just major third.&quot; Sethares (2005), p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1510 onward, as thirds came to be treated as consonances, [[meantone temperament]], and particularly [[quarter-comma meantone]], which tunes thirds to the relatively simple ratio of [[sesquiquartum|5:4]], became the most popular system for tuning keyboards. At the same time, syntonic-diatonic [[just intonation]] was posited first by [[Bartolomé Ramos de Pareja|Ramos]] and then by [[Zarlino]] as the normal tuning for singers.

However, meantone presented its own harmonic challenges. Its wolf intervals proved to be even worse than those of the Pythagorean tuning (so much so that it often required 19 keys to the octave as opposed to the 12 in Pythagorean tuning). As a consequence, meantone was not suitable for all music. From around the 18th century, as the desire grew for instruments to change key, and therefore to avoid a wolf interval, this led to the widespread use of [[well temperament]]s and eventually [[equal temperament]].

Pythagorean temperament can still be heard in some parts of modern classical music from singers and from instruments with no fixed tuning such as the [[violin family]]. Where a performer has an unaccompanied passage based on scales, they will tend towards using Pythagorean intonation as that will make the scale sound best in tune, then reverting to other temperaments for other passages (just intonation for chordal or arpeggiated figures, and equal temperament when accompanied with piano or orchestra).  This can be seen in the first bar of Bach's Sonata no.1 for unaccompanied violin, where the b-flat in the opening chord is played naturally in just intonation and sounds flatter than the subsequent b-flat which appears in a descending scale and is naturally Pythagorean. Such changes are never explicitly notated and are scarcely noticeable to the audience, just sounding 'in tune'.

[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Fur trade|Fur trading]] at Fort Nez Percés in 1841.]]
The '''Native American Trade''' refers to historic [[trade]] between Europeans and their North American descendants and the [[Indigenous people of North America]] (today known as [[Native Americans in the United States]], and [[First Nations in Canada]], but should be referd to as natives), beginning before the colonial period and continuing through the 19th century, although declining it around 1937.

The term Indian Trade describes the people involved in the trade. The products involved varied by region and era. In most of Canada the term is synonymous with the [[fur trade in North America|fur trade]], since fur for making [[beaver hats]] was by far the most valuable product of the trade, from the European point of view. Demand for other products resulted in trade in those items: Europeans asked for [[deerskin trade|deerskin]] in the Southeast coast of the United States, and for [[American bison|buffalo]] skins and meat, and [[pemmican]] on the [[Great Plains]]. In turn, Native America demand influenced the trade goods brought by Europeans.

Economic contact between Native Americans and European colonists began in the early stages of European settlement. From the 17th to the 19th century, the [[English people|English]] and [[French people|French]] mainly traded for animal pelts and fur with Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan 1929, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, trading between the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and Native Americans was sporadic and lasted only for a couple of decades.&lt;ref&gt;Pritzker 1998, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, wars, the dwindling of Native American populations and the westward expansion of the [[United States]] led to the confinement of tribes to reservations and the end of this kind of economic relations between Indians and European Americans.

Other economic relations continued, especially in the alcohol trade around many reservations, and for Native American arts and crafts that are now shown for everyone to see. Today, many Native Americans satisfy a different kind of demand with the associated trades of their gaming casinos on reservations. These have been developed as entertainment and conference resorts, serving a wide market of customers, and generating very little revenues for tribes to use for economic development, as well as welfare and education of their people.

The first explorers to conduct trade with Native Americans were [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] and [[Jacques Cartier]] in the 1520s-1540s. Verrazzano noted in his book, &quot;If we wanted to trade with them for some of their things, they would come to the seashore on some rocks where the breakers were most violent while we remained on the little boat, and they sent us what they wanted to give on a rope, continually shouting to us not to approach the land.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Dolin 2010, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; As visits from Europeans became more frequent and some Europeans began to settle in North America, Natives began to establish regular trade relations with these new colonists. The ideal locations for fur trading were near harbors where ships could come in.

==Trade with early European settlers==
'''Plymouth and Jamestown'''

In order to set up a thriving colony, settlers in the New World needed the five factors of production that contribute to the creation of wealth: land (natural resources), labor, capital, entrepreneurship and knowledge.  Often, trading with Native Americans resulted in colonists gaining needed knowledge and natural resources. Examples of this can be seen in the English settlements of Plymouth Bay and Jamestown. [[Chief Massasoit]], a Wampanoag, and [[Squanto]], a Patuxet Natives, helped the [[Pilgrims]] of [[Plymouth Bay]] establish their colony by teaching them skills in cultivating this land and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan 1929, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; In return for weapons and tools, these Native Americans provided the colonists with important natural resources, including food.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan 1929, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1621 Chief Massasoit established one of the earliest trading pacts between Europeans and Natives by signing a treaty with Plymouth Colony to engage in peaceful trade.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan 1929, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of English colonists in the [[New England]] area began to grow, the Wampanoag became uneasy of losing their land to these new settlers. Gradually, tensions escalated, leading to [[King Philip's War]], an armed conflict between the Pilgrims and the Native Americans in the area. The war ended with the defeat of the Native tribe, causing a serious fracture amongst relations between the Pilgrims and Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan 1929, p.320&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between settlers in the Jamestown area and Native Americans ended similarly. Initially, the Powahatan aided the English settlers with food and clothing, helping them survive the early difficult years. However, relations between the two groups deteriorated after three years, resulting in a war.

'''Fur trading posts'''

Fur trading was one of the main economic activities in Northern America from the late 16th century to the mid-19th century. At the time, demand for fur was surging in Europe as it was used to make cloth and fancy hats.  Data collected from England in the 18th century highlights that the years from 1746 to 1763 saw an increase of 12 shillings per pelt. It has been calculated that over 20 million beaver hats were exported from England alone from 1700 to 1770.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos&lt;/ref&gt; Both trading partners, Native Americans and Europeans, provided the other a comparative advantage in the fur trade industry. The opportunity cost of hunting beavers in Europe was extremely high: by the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Eurasian beaver was near extinction in England and France.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, traders and trappers thought the wildlife in the New World was essentially limitless. Native Americans made use of the trade goods received, particularly knives, axes, and guns. The fur trade provided a stable source of income for many Native Americans until the mid-19th century, when changing fashion trends in Europe and a decline in the beaver population in North America brought about a collapse in demand for fur.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trade with the Spanish'''
Trading between Spanish settlers and Native Americans was rare and occurred in parts of New Mexico and California. The Spanish mainly intended to spread the Christian faith to Natives and to establish encomienda. The most significant effect of trading with the Spanish was the introduction of the horse to the [[Ute people|Ute]] in New Mexico. Gradually, horses bred and their use was adopted across the Great Plains, dramatically altering the lifestyles and customs of many Native American tribes. Many Natives switched from a hunter- gatherer economy to a nomadic lifestyle after they began using horses for transportation. They had a greater range for hunting bison and trading with other tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Pritzker, 88&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relationship between Europeans and Natives'''
It took time for Europeans and Native Americans to learn the customs of the other side. When Europeans first encountered a tribe, they would often be offered fur, food or other items as gifts. The Europeans did not understand they were supposed to take on an alliance with the natives, including helping them against their enemies. Native American tribes regularly practice gift giving as part of their social relations. Because the Europeans did not (or most of them), they were considered to be rude and crude.

After observing that Europeans wanted to trade goods for the skins and other items, Native Americans entered into that. Both sides became involved in the conflicts of the other. In New France, in Carolina, Virginia, and New England and in New Netherland, the Europeans became drawn into the endemic warfare of their trading partners. As Native Americans were pressed into alliances by the Europeans for Queen Anne's War, the Seven Years' War, the Nine Years' War, and other standing competitions among the European powers: France, Great Britain and Spain, with whom they were dealing in North America, they felt drawn into the Europeans' endemic warfare.

==Late 19th century to present==
After the United States became independent, it enacted legislation to regulate trading with the Indians/Native Americans, under the [[Trade and Intercourse Act]], first passed on July 22, 1790. Later the [[Bureau of Natives Affairs|Natives Office]], which was then part of the War Department, issued licenses to traders in the [[Native Territory]]. Under removal, the largest tribes from the Southeast and north of the Ohio were moved west of the Mississippi river. By 1834 Native Territory had been designated as what was then most of the United States west of the Mississippi, primarily what became Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma. Territories of the upper West were still occupied by native tribes as well. Mountain men and traders from Mexico freely operated there independently of the US.

After the formation of the United States, the commerce clause of the constitution gave Congress the power to &quot;regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Native tribes.&quot; In the 19th century, the American government passed legislation to support relocation of tribes to reservations in order to extinguish their title to lands that could be sold to European Americans. The [[Native Removal Act of 1830]] forced tribes such as the Cherokee and the Choctaw to move out of their homelands.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance by Native Americans to relocate resulted in conflicts such as the [[Second Seminole War]], that caused the deaths of 3000 Native Americans. Forcing tribes to relocate and to adjust to isolated reservations often unsuitable for the subsistence farming they were encouraged to undertake, made many of them dependent on the U.S. government for annuities and supplies. They had difficulty trying to develop economic systems of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue&lt;/ref&gt;

As outlined by Kalt and Cornell in their book, ''What Can Tribes Do? Strategies and Institutions in American Native Economic Development,'' on reservations, tribes lacked access to capital, were assigned to areas with poor natural resources (or had their resources stolen or kept from their control), and did not possess skilled labor.

Today, many programs, such as the [[Harvard Project on American Native Economic Development]], exist to foster conditions that will help reservations become independent and financially stable communities. Since the late 20th century, many tribes have established gaming casinos. The most successful ones use part of the revenues for economic development of their nations, as well as for welfare and education for all their tribal members.

      <text bytes="33076" xml:space="preserve">'''Meantone temperament''' is a [[musical temperament]], that is a [[Musical tuning#Tuning systems|tuning system]], obtained by slightly compromising the fifths in order to improve the thirds. Meantone temperaments are constructed the same way as [[Pythagorean tuning]], as a stack of equal fifths, but in meantone each fifth is ''narrow'' compared to the [[perfect fifth]] of ratio 3:2.
[[Image:Meantone.jpg|500px|thumb|right|Comparison between [[Pythagorean tuning]] (blue), [[equal-tempered]] (black), [[quarter-comma meantone]] (red) and third-comma meantone (green). For each, the common origin is arbitrarily chosen as C. The degrees are arranged in the order of the cycle of fifths; as in each of these tunings all fifths are of the same size, the tunings appear as straight lines, the slope indicating the relative tempering with respect to Pythagorean, which has pure fifths (3:2, 702 cents). The Pythagorean A{{music|flat}} (at the left) is at 792 cents, G{{music|sharp}} (at the right) at 816 cents; the difference is the [[Pythagorean comma]]. Equal temperament by definition is such that A{{music|flat}} and G{{music|sharp}} are at the same level. Quarter-comma meantone produces the &quot;just&quot; major third (5:4, 386 cents, a [[syntonic comma]] lower than the Pythagorean one of 408 cents). Third-comma meantone produces the &quot;just&quot; minor third (6:5, 316 cents, a syntonic comma higher than the Pythagorean one of 294 cents). In both these meantone temperaments, the enharmony, here the difference between A{{music|flat}} and G{{music|sharp}}, is much larger than in Pythagorean, and with the flat degree higher than the sharp one.]]

==Expressed in terms of the Dynamic Tonality paradigm==
Using the terminology and concepts of the [[Dynamic Tonality]] paradigm, the meantone temperament is defined as &quot;the [[syntonic temperament]] with its tuning range constrained to be from P5=694.79¢ to P5=701.96¢.&quot; This constraint is an artifact of the [[Dynamic_tonality#The_Static_Timbre_paradigm|Static Timbre Paradigm]], which was the dominant paradigm, especially for keyboard instruments, up to the present day. In the Static Timbre Paradigm, a tuning's notes are tempered away from Just Intonation, but a timbres' partials are not tempered away from the Harmonic Series.

Tempering a tuning's notes, but not the partials of the timbres in which that tuning is played, inevitably results in a mis-alignment of notes and partials, thus making the tuning and timbre less &quot;related.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Relating&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The less related a tuning and timbre are, the less consonant they are when played together. This misalignment constrained meantone to the range of tunings which were consonant when played using Harmonic timbres.

Because the meantone temperament is a subrange of the syntonic temperament, which is a rank-2 temperament, this article will briefly discuss rank-2 temperaments and the syntonic temperament.

===Rank-2 temperaments===
In the [[Dynamic Tonality]] paradigm, a given rank-2 temperament is defined by a period α, a generator β, and a [[Comma_(music)#Comma_sequence|comma sequence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fingering&quot;&gt; {{Cite journal |title=Invariant Fingerings Across a Tuning Continuum

&lt;/ref&gt; A rank-2 temperament defines a rank-2 (''i.e.'', two-dimensional) note-space, as shown in Video 1.
[[File:Note-space.webm|thumb|Video 1: Generating a rank-2 note-space.]]

===The syntonic temperament===
The syntonic temperament is a rank-2 temperament defined by its period (the just perfect octave, 1/2), its generator (the just perfect fifth, 3/2) and its comma sequence (that starts with the [[syntonic comma]], 81/80, which names the temperament). The construction of the syntonic temperament's note-space is shown in Video 2.
[[File:Syntonic_space_%281080%29.webm|thumb|Video 2: Generating the syntonic temperament's note-space (which is the same as the meantone temperament's note-space).]]

The valid tuning range of the syntonic temperament is shown in Figure 1 as extending from P5=686¢ to P5=720¢, a range of (720-686=) 34¢.

===The meantone temperament===
The meantone temperament is exactly the same as the syntonic temperament: that is, they have the same period (the octave), generator (the perfect fifth), and comma sequence (starting with the syntonic comma). The only difference is that the meantone temperament's tuning range is constrained to be a subrange of the syntonic temperament's valid tuning range, equivalent to the &quot;Purer-Tuning Range&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;X_System&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which extends from P5=686¢ to P5=720¢, and the subrange of meantone tunings extending from P5=694.79¢ to P5=701.96¢ (labeled as the &quot;Purer-Tuning Range&quot;). Notable meantone tunings are labeled, at center-left, with names of the form &quot;{{frac|''n''|''d''}}-comma&quot;.]]

===Why does meantone have a narrower tuning range?===
Tempering a timbre's partials such that they align with the tuning's notes, as per [[Dynamic Tonality]], maximizes [[Consonance_and_dissonance|consonance]] across the entire tuning range of the syntonic temperament.

The meantone temperament's narrower range is an artifact of the [[Dynamic_tonality#The_Static_Timbre_paradigm | Static Timbre Paradigm]], in which Just tunings are tempered to be [[Dynamic_tonality#Just_tunings|pseudo-Just]], but the [[Dynamic_tonality#Harmonic_timbres|Harmonic timbres]] in which those tunings are played are untempered. This inevitably misaligns the tuning's notes and timbre's partials, making them less related{{r|Relating|}} and hence less consonant. The farther one tunes away from the meantone temperament's defined tuning subrange, the less related the tuning &amp; timbre will be, and hence the less consonant, when using untempered Harmonic timbres.

Outside of this section, this article discusses the meantone temperament primarily within the context of the Static Timbre Paradigm.

==Notable meantone temperaments==
[[Equal temperament]], obtained by making all semitones the same size, each equal to one-twelfth of an octave (with ratio the 12th root of 2 to one ({{radic|2|12}}:1), narrows the fifths by about 2 cents or 1/12 of a [[Pythagorean comma]], and produces thirds that are only slightly better than in Pythagorean tuning. Equal temperament is roughly the same as 1/11 comma meantone tuning.

[[Quarter-comma meantone]], which tempers the fifths by 1/4 comma, is the best known type of meantone temperament, and the term ''meantone temperament'' is often used to refer to it specifically. Four ascending fifths (as C–G–D–A–E) tempered by 1/4 comma produce a perfect [[major third]] (C–E), one [[syntonic comma]] narrower than the Pythagorean third that would result from four [[perfect fifth]]s. Quarter-comma meantone has been practiced from the early 16th century to the end of the 19th.

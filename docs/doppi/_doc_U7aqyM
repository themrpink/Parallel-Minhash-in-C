Lviv is one of the most important cultural centres of Ukraine. The city is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre. Nowadays, the indisputable evidence of the city cultural richness is a big number of theatres, concert halls, creative unions, and also the high number of many artistic activities (more than 100 festivals annually, 60 museums, 10 theatres).

[[Old Town (Lviv)|Lviv's historic centre]] has been on the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage list]] since 1998. UNESCO gave the following reasons&lt;ref&gt;[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/865 L'viv&amp;nbsp;– the Ensemble of the Historic Centre], UNESCO&amp;nbsp;– World Heritage. URL Accessed: 30 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; for its selection:

{{quote|Criterion II: In its urban fabric and its architecture, Lviv is an outstanding example of the fusion of the architectural and artistic traditions of central and eastern Europe with those of Italy and Germany.}}

{{quote|Criterion V: The political and commercial role of Lviv attracted to it a number of ethnic groups with different cultural and religious traditions, who established separate yet interdependent communities within the city, evidence for which is still discernible in the modern town's landscape.}}

=== Architecture ===
[[File:ProspektSvobodyLviv.jpg|thumb|right|Early 20th century architecture in Lviv]]
Lviv's historic churches, buildings and relics date from the 13th century – early 20th century (Polish and Austro-Hungarian rule). In recent centuries Lviv was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other [[List of cities in Ukraine|Ukrainian cities]]. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. 
After the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its [[gothic architecture|gothic]]-style buildings but it retains many buildings in [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and the [[classical architecture|classic]] styles. There are works by artists of the [[Vienna Secession]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].

The buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the [[architectural style]] changes radically as Soviet-era [[high-rise]] blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.

=== Monuments ===
[[File:Lviv - Church of Transfiguration 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the [[Church of Transfiguration, Lviv|Church of the Transfiguration]]]]
[[File:Успенская церковь в Львов.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Dormition Church, Lviv|Church of the Assumption]]]]
[[File:Chapel-of-Boim-family.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chapel of the Boim family]]]]

Outdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex [[history of Lviv]]. There are monuments to [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Ivan Franko]], [[Daniel of Galicia|King Danylo]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], [[Ioan Potcoavă|Ivan Pidkova]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Jan Kiliński]], [[Ivan Trush]], [[Saint George]], [[Wojciech Bartosz Głowacki|Bartosz Głowacki]], the monument to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], to [[Nikifor]], [[The Good Soldier Švejk]], [[Stepan Bandera]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], and many others.

During the [[interwar period]] there were monuments commemorating important figures of the history of Poland. Some of them were moved to the Polish &quot;[[Recovered Territories]]&quot; after World War II, like the monument to [[Aleksander Fredro]] which now is in [[Wrocław]], the monument of King [[John III Sobieski]] which after 1945 was moved to [[Gdańsk]], and the monument of [[Kornel Ujejski]] which is now in [[Szczecin]]. A book market takes place around the monument to [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fеdorovych]], a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.

New ideas came to Lviv during the Austro–Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many [[publishing]] houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the [[Ossolineum]] which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local Jesuit church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to return these documents to Poland. Subsequently, in 2003 Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006 an office of the Ossolineum (which now is located in [[Wrocław]]) was opened in Lviv and began a process to scan all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian]], Yiddish, and [[Polish literature]], with a multitude of translations.

=== Religion ===
Lviv is a city of religious variety. [[Religion]] (2012): Catholic: 57% ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] 56% and [[Roman Catholic Church]] 1%) [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]]: 32%, [[Protestantism]]: 2% [[Judaism]] : 0.1% Other religion: 3% Indifferent to religious matters: 4% [[Atheism]]: 1.9%&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045226/http://city-institute.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=231:who-is-he-the-citizen-of-lviv&amp;catid=1:latest Who is he, the citizen of Lviv?| Lviv City Institute].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christianity ====
At one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. The largest [[Christian Church]]es have existed in the city since the 13th century. The city has been the seat of the Catholic Church in 3 rites: The [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv]], the [[Roman Catholics]], and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]]. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the Orthodox community in Ukraine [[Union of Brest|transferred their allegiance]] to the [[Pope]] in Rome and became the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival.

Lviv is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], the centre of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine]] and until 21 August 2005 was the centre of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], 9 per cent to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate]] and 6 per cent to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].

Until 2005, Lviv was the only city with two Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]]: [[Lubomyr Husar]] ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Byzantine Rite]]) and [[Marian Jaworski]] ([[Catholic Church|Latin Rite]]).

In June 2001, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the [[Latin Cathedral, Lviv|Latin Cathedral]], [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] and the [[Armenian Cathedral, Lviv|Armenian Cathedral]].

==== Judaism ====
Lviv historically had a large and active [[Jewish community]] and until 1941 at least 45 [[synagogue]]s and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the [[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]. The [[Golden Rose Synagogue (Lviv)|Golden Rose Synagogue]] was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more [[cultural assimilation]] and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm#vip2|title=International Forum:&quot;Challenge of Holocaust and Its Lessons&quot;|work=Lviv Polytechnic National University Regional Holocaust Study Center: Ukrainian Holocaust History Study Center|date=November 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308035832/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. Only since the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.

Currently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the [[Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue]].

=== Arts ===
[[File:Lwowska Galeria Sztuki - Wnętrza 01.JPG|thumb|left|A room in the &lt;br /&gt; [[Lviv National Art Gallery]]]]

The range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, [[Johann Georg Pinsel|Johann Georg Pinzel]], whose works can be seen on the façade of the [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], who began her career as a singer of Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of La Scala Opera in Milan.

The &quot;Group Artes&quot; was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: [[Futurism]], [[Cubism]], [[New Objectivity]] and [[Surrealism]]. Co–operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by &quot;''Artes''&quot; took place in Warsaw, Kraków, Łódz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Kosmolinska, Natalia (2007). &quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFbmtdibpIMC&amp;pg=PA224 Ein Fenster zur Moderne: Das Atelier der Sielskis].&quot; In: Hermann Simon, Irene Stratenwerth, &amp; Ronald Hinrichs (Eds.), ''Lemberg: Eine Reise nach Europa'' Berlin: Christoph Links Verlag. pp. 218–227; here: p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900–1980) and Roman Sielski (1903–1990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as [[Aleksander Fredro]], [[Gabriela Zapolska]], [[Leopold Staff]], [[Maria Konopnicka]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]] living in Lviv.

Today Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries (The &quot;Dzyga&quot; Gallery, Аrt-Gallery &quot;Primus&quot;, Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art &quot;Zelena Kanapa&quot; and others). [[Lviv National Art Gallery]] is the largest museum of arts in Ukraine, with approximately 50,000 artworks, including paintings, sculptures and works of graphic art of Western and Eastern Europe, from the Middle Ages to modern days.

=== Theatre and opera ===
[[File:46-101-1483 Lviv Opera SAM 7712 Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre]], an important cultural centre for residents and visitors]]

In 1842 the [[Skarbek Theatre]] was opened making it the third-largest theatre in [[Central Europe]]. In 1903 the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv National Opera]] house, which at that time was called the City-Theatre, was opened emulating the [[Vienna State Opera]] house. The house initially offered a changing repertoire such as classical dramas in German and [[Polish language]], opera, operetta, comedy and theatre.
The opera house is named after the Ukrainian opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Krushelnytska]] who worked here.

In the [[Janowska concentration camp]], the Nazis conducted torture and executions to music. To do so they brought almost the whole Lviv National Opera to the camp. Professor Shtriks, opera conductor Mund and other famous Jewish musicians were among the members. From 1941 to 1944 the Nazis massacred 200,000 people including all 40 musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Tango-Death-Story-Holocaust-Survivors/dp/B085HHMGMT/|title=Tango of Death. A True Story of Holocaust Survivors|last=Baranovskiy|first=Mikhail|date=202|website=ISBN 979-8620147014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] has a large creative group of performers who strive to maintain traditions of Ukrainian opera and classical ballet. The Theatre is a well-organized creative body where over 500 people work towards a common goal. The repertoire includes 10 Ukrainian music compositions. No other similar theatre in Ukraine has such a large number of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] productions. There are also many operas written by foreign composers, and most of these operas are performed in the original language: ''Othello'', ''Aida'', ''La Traviata'', ''Nabucco'', and ''A Masked Ball'' by G. Verdi, ''Tosca'', ''La Bohème'' and ''Madame Butterfly'' by G. Puccini, ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' by P. Mascagni, and ''Pagliacci'' by R. Leoncavallo (in Italian); ''Carmen'' by G. Bizet (in French), ''The Haunted Manor'' by S. Moniuszko (in Polish)

=== Museums and art galleries ===
Museum Pharmacy &quot;Pid Chornym Orlom&quot; (Beneath the Black Eagle) was founded in 1735; it is the oldest pharmacy in Lviv. A museum related to pharmaceutical history was opened on the premises of the old pharmacy in 1966. The idea of creating such a museum had already come up in the 19th century. The Galician Association of Pharmacists was created in 1868; members managed to assemble a small collection of exhibits, thus making the first step towards creating a new museum. Nowadays, the exhibition has expanded considerably, with 16 exhibit rooms and a general exhibition surface totalling 700 sq. m. There are more than 3,000 exhibits in the museum. This is the only operating Museum Pharmacy in Ukraine and Europe.
[[File:Промышленный музей.jpg|thumb|left|The main building of [[Lviv National Museum]]]]

The most notable of the museums are [[Lviv National Museum]] which houses the National Gallery. Its collection includes more than 140,000 unique items. The museum takes special pride in presenting the largest and most complete collection of medieval sacral art of the 12th to 18th centuries: icons, manuscripts, rare ancient books, decoratively carved pieces of art, metal and plastic artworks, and fabrics embroidered with gold and silver. The museum also boasts a unique monument of [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style: the Bohorodchansky Iconostasis. Exhibits include: Ancient Ukrainian art from the 12th to 15th centuries; Ukrainian art from the 16th to 18th centuries; and Ukrainian art from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 20th centuries.

=== Music ===
Lviv has an active musical and cultural life. Apart from the Lviv Opera, it has symphony orchestras, chamber orchestras and the Trembita Chorus. Lviv has one of the most prominent music academies and music colleges in Ukraine, the [[Lviv Conservatory]], and also has a factory for the manufacture of stringed musical instruments. Lviv has been the home of numerous composers such as Mozart's son [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart]], [[Stanyslav Lyudkevych|Stanislav Liudkevych]], [[Wojciech Kilar]] and [[Mykola Kolessa]].

Flute virtuoso and composer [[Franz Doppler|Albert Franz Doppler]] (1821–1883) was born and spent his formative years here, including flute lessons from his father. The classical pianist [[Mieczysław Horszowski]] (1892–1993) was born here. The opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Kruszelnicka]] called Lviv her home in the 1920s to 1930s. The classical violinist Adam Han Gorski was born here in 1940. &quot;''[[Polish Radio Lwów]]''&quot; was a [[Polskie Radio|Polish radio]] station that went on-air on 15 January 1930. The programme proved very popular in Poland. [[Classical music]] and entertainment was aired as well as lectures, readings, youth-programmes, news and liturgical services on Sunday.
[[File:PikkardiyskaTertsia01.jpg|thumb|[[Pikkardiyska Tertsiya]] – Ukrainian a cappella musical formation]]
Popular throughout Poland was the [[Wesoła Lwowska Fala|Comic Lwów Wave]] a [[cabaret]]-revue with [[musical composition|musical pieces]]. Jewish artists contributed a great part to this artistic activity. Composers such as [[Henryk Wars]], songwriters [[Emanuel Szlechter]] and [[Wiktor Budzyński]], the actor [[Wesoła Lwowska Fala|Mieczysław Monderer]] and [[Wesoła Lwowska Fala|Adolf Fleischer]] (&quot;''Aprikosenkranz und Untenbaum''&quot;) worked in Lviv. The most notable stars of the shows were [[Henryk Vogelfänger]] and [[Kazimierz Wajda]] who appeared together as the comic duo &quot;Szczepko and Tońko&quot; and were similar to [[Laurel and Hardy]].

The Lviv Philharmonic is a major cultural centre with its long history and traditions that complement the entire culture of [[Ukraine]]. Exactly from the stage of Lviv Philharmonic began their way to the great art world-famous Ukrainian musicians – [[Oleh Krysa]], Oleksandr Slobodyanik, Yuriy Lysychenko, Maria Chaikovska, also the musicians of new generation – E. Chupryk, Y. Ermin, Oksana Rapita, Olexandr Kozarenko.

=== Universities and academia ===
[[File:University Lviv 2009 1.JPG|thumb|left|The front [[Facade|façade]] of the [[Lviv University]], the oldest university in Ukraine]]
[[Lviv University]] is one of the oldest in Central Europe and was founded as a [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuit) school in 1608. Its prestige greatly increased through the work of philosopher [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866–1938) who was one of the founders of the [[Lwów-Warsaw School of Logic]]. This [[school of thought]] set benchmarks for academic research and [[education]] in Poland. The Polish politician of the interbellum period [[Stanisław Głąbiński]] had served as dean of the law department (1889–1890) and as the University rector (1908–1909). In 1901 the city was the seat of the [[Lwów Scientific Society]] among whose members were major scientific figures. The most well-known were the mathematicians [[Stefan Banach]], [[Juliusz Schauder]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam|Stanisław Ulam]] who were founders of the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]] turning Lviv in the 1930s into the &quot;World Centre of Functional Analysis&quot; and whose share in Lviv academia was substantial.

In 1852 in [[Dublany, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Dublany]] ({{convert|8|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the outskirts of Lviv) the [[Agricultural Academy in Dublany|Agricultural Academy]] was opened and was one of the first Polish agricultural colleges. The Academy was merged with the [[Lviv Polytechnic]] in 1919. Another important college of the interbellum period was the [[Academy of Foreign Trade in Lwów]].

In 1873 in Lviv was founded [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] from the beginning it attracted the financial and intellectual support of writers and patrons of [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian]] background.

In 1893 due to the change in its statute, the Shevchenko Scientific Society was transformed into a real scholarly multidisciplinary academy of sciences. Under the presidency of the historian, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], it greatly expanded its activities, contributing to both the humanities and the physical sciences, law and medicine, but most specifically once again it was concentrated onto the Ukrainian studies.
The Soviet Union annexed the eastern half of the Second Polish Republic including the city of Lwów which capitulated to the Red Army on 22 September 1939. Upon their occupation of Lviv, the Soviets dissolved the Shevchenko society. Many of its members were arrested and either imprisoned or executed.

=== Mathematics ===
Lviv was the home of the [[Scottish Café]], where in the 1930s and the early 1940s, Polish [[mathematician]]s from the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]] met and spent their afternoons discussing mathematical problems. [[Stanislaw Ulam|Stanisław Ulam]] who was later a participant in the [[Manhattan Project]] and the proposer of the [[Teller–Ulam design|Teller-Ulam design]] of [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapons]], [[Stefan Banach]] one of the founders of [[functional analysis]], [[Hugo Steinhaus]], [[Karol Borsuk]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], [[Mark Kac]] and many other notable mathematicians would gather there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulam&quot;&gt;Stanislaw M.

[[File:So Cal Coastline photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[California State Route 1|State Route 1]] winds down the coast over Corona Del Mar State Beach]]
Ground transportation in Orange County relies heavily on three major interstate highways: the [[Santa Ana Freeway]] (I-5), the [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway]] (I-405 and [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]] south of Irvine), and the [[San Gabriel River Freeway]] ([[Interstate 605 (California)|I-605]]), which briefly passes through northwestern Orange County. The other freeways in the county are state highways, and include the [[Riverside Freeway|Riverside]] and [[Artesia Freeway]] ([[California State Route 91|SR 91]]) and the [[Garden Grove Freeway]] ([[California State Route 22|SR 22]]) running east–west, and the [[Orange Freeway]] ([[California State Route 57|SR 57]]), the [[Costa Mesa Freeway]] ([[California State Route 55|SR 55]]), the Laguna Freeway ([[California State Route 133|SR 133]]), the [[San Joaquin Hills Toll Road|San Joaquin Transportation Corridor]] ([[California State Route 73|SR 73]]), the [[Eastern Toll Road (California)|Eastern Transportation Corridor]] ([[California State Route 261|SR 261]], [[California State Route 133|SR 133]], [[California State Route 241|SR 241]]), and the [[Foothill Toll Road|Foothill Transportation Corridor]] ([[California State Route 241|SR 241]]) running north–south.

[[File:Anaheim-streetbanners-ducksangels.JPG|thumb|Street banners promoting the county's two major league teams, the Ducks and the Angels.]]

The [[Major League Baseball]] team in Orange County is the [[Los Angeles Angels]].  The team won the [[World Series]] under manager [[Mike Scioscia]] in [[2002 World Series|2002]].  In 2005, new owner [[Arte Moreno]] wanted to change the name to &quot;Los Angeles Angels&quot; in order to better tap into the Los Angeles media market, the second largest in the country. However, the standing agreement with the city of Anaheim demanded that they have &quot;Anaheim&quot; in the name, so they became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. This name change was hotly disputed by the city of Anaheim, but the change stood and still stands today, which [[City of Anaheim v. Angels Baseball LP|prompted a lawsuit]] by the city of Anaheim against Arte Moreno, won by the latter.

The county's [[National Hockey League]] team, the [[Anaheim Ducks]], won the 2007 [[Stanley Cup]] beating the [[Ottawa Senators]].  They also came close to winning the 2003 Stanley Cup finals after losing in Game 7 against the [[New Jersey Devils]].

Past champions include Fred Couples (2010), Hale Irwin (1998 and 2002), Nick Price (2011), Bernhard Langer (2008) and Jay Haas (2007).  The tournament benefits the Hoag Hospital Foundation and has raised over $16&amp;nbsp;million in its first 16 years.

[[Orange County SC]] is a [[United Soccer League]] team and are the only professional soccer club in Orange County. The team's first season was in 2011 and it was successful as [[Charlie Naimo]]'s team made it to the quarter-finals of the playoffs. With home games played at Championship Soccer Stadium in [[Orange County Great Park]] the team looks to grow in the Orange County community and reach continued success. Former and current Orange County SC players include [[Richard Chaplow]], [[Bright Dike]], [[Maykel Galindo]], [[Carlos Borja (American soccer)|Carlos Borja]], and goalkeeper [[Amir Abedzadeh]].

The [[National Football League]] left the county when the [[Los Angeles Rams]] relocated to [[St. Louis]] in 1995. They relocated back to Southern California in January 2016.

The [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Los Angeles Clippers]] played some home games at The Arrowhead Pond, now known as the [[Honda Center]], from 1994 to 1999, before moving to [[Staples Center]], which they share with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].

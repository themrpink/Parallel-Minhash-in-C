{{as of|July 2019}}, 7-Eleven has stores in all 47 prefectures of Japan with the opening of 14 new locations in Okinawa Prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.okinawa.org/blog/seven-eleven-opening-at-7-a-m-on-7-11-2019.51/|title=Seven-Eleven Opening at 7&amp;nbsp;am.

The aesthetics of the store are somewhat different from that of 7-Eleven stores in other countries as the stores offer a wider selection of products and services. 7-Eleven stores in Japan are also popular among tourists from other countries, as the [[Seven Bank]] [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] machines at branches will accept foreign [[debit cards|debit]] and [[credit card]]s for withdrawing cash in Japanese yen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=You can withdraw Japanese yen from ATMs at 7-Eleven stores |url=https://www.sevenbank.co.jp/intlcard/index2.html |website=[[Seven Bank]] Ltd. |access-date=September 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the example of other convenience stores in Japan, 7-Eleven has solar panels and LEDs installed in about 1,400 of its stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |newspaper= Tokyo Weekender | url = http://www.tokyoweekender.com/2012/05/solar-convenience-stores/ | title = Solar Convenience Stores | date = May 9, 2012 | access-date = September 26, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2019, 7-Eleven launched then almost immediately suspended a mobile payment service, 7pay.  The service was hacked upon launch, and attackers were able to spend money from affected customers' accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/07/04/business/corporate-business/users-7-elevens-mobile-payment-service-lose-total-%C2%A555-million-900-accounts-hacked/#.XU9xQehKi72 Users of 7-Eleven's mobile payment service lose total of ¥55 million after 900 accounts hacked]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Macau ====

7-Eleven entered the [[Macau]] market in 2005 under the ownership of [[Dairy Farm International Holdings|Dairy Farm]], the same conglomeration group operating Hong Kong's 7-Eleven. With only 25.9 square kilometers, Macau has 45 stores, making it the single market with the highest density of 7-Eleven stores, containing one store per 0.65 square kilometers.

==== Mainland China ====

7-Eleven opened its first store in China in [[Shenzhen]], Guangdong in 1992 and later expanded to [[Beijing]] in 2004, [[Tianjin]] and [[Shanghai]] in 2009, [[Chengdu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2013-06/18/content_16635887.htm|title=7-Eleven to open 300 stores in Chongqing|author =关晓萌}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011, [[Qingdao]] in 2012, [[Chongqing]] in 2013, [[Hangzhou]] and [[Ningbo]] in 2017, [[Nanjing]] in 2018, and [[Wuhan]], [[Xi'an]], and [[Fuzhou]] in 2019. In China's 7-Eleven stores where Slurpees are offered, the Chinese name [[:zh:思乐冰|思乐冰]] (sīlèbīng) is used. They also offer a wide array of warm food, including traditional items like steamed buns, and stores in Chengdu offer a full variety of onigiri (饭团). Beverages, alcohol, candy, periodicals, and other convenience items are available as well. The majority of these stores are open for 24 hours a day.

==== Malaysia ====
[[File:7-Eleven in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.jpg|thumb|A 7-Eleven store in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]|210x210px]]
Malaysian 7-Eleven stores are owned by 7-Eleven Malaysia Sdn. Bhd., which operates 2,225 stores nationwide. 7-Eleven in Malaysia was incorporated on June 4, 1984, by the [[Berjaya Group|Berjaya Group Berhad]]. The first 7-Eleven store was opened in October 1984, in [[Jalan Bukit Bintang]], Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Company Overview of 7-Eleven Malaysia Sdn Bhd|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=22400508|magazine=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|access-date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmetro.com.my/node/153103|title=7-Eleven buka cawangan ke 2,000|access-date=October 29, 2016|date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Philippines ====

In the [[Philippines]], 7-Eleven is run by the Philippine Seven Corporation (PSC). Its first store, located in [[Quezon City]], opened in 1984. In 2000, [[Uni-President Enterprises Corporation|President Chain Store Corporation (PCSC)]] of [[Taiwan]], also a licensee of 7-Eleven, purchased the majority shares of PSC and thus formed a strategic alliance for the convenience store industry within the area. The number of stores reached 1,602 at the end of 2015. As of 2017, there are 2,285 7-Eleven stores all over the Philippines.

Starting Oct 2019, 7-Eleven signed an agreement with Caltex to use the former as its convenience stores in its gas stations nationwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Caltex Stations Offers More Convenience with 7-El|url=https://www.caltex.comhttps//www.caltex.com/ph/about-us/news/2009/caltex-stations-offers-more-convenience-with-7-eleven-stores.html|access-date=2020-10-06|website=Caltex Philippines|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus rapidly increasing 7-Eleven  store chains count in a short span of time.

==== Singapore ====

In Singapore, 7-Eleven forms the largest chain of [[convenience stores]] island-wide. There are 393 7-Eleven stores scattered throughout the country as of February 2018. Stores in Singapore are operated by [[Dairy Farm International Holdings]], franchised under a licensing agreement with 7-Eleven Incorporated. The first 7-Eleven store in Singapore was opened along Upper Changi Road in 1983, and in 1986 the first franchised 7-Eleven store (under the [[Jardine Matheson Group]]) was opened. The license was then acquired by [[Cold Storage (supermarket)|Cold Storage]] Singapore, a subsidiary of the [[Dairy Farm International Holdings|Dairy Farm Group]], in 1989.

In 2006, [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Singapore]] and 7-Eleven agreed to rebrand all 68 of its Shell Select convenience stores into 7-Eleven. The partnership was terminated in October 2017, and the remaining 52 7-Eleven stores in Shell petrol stations will be gradually rebranded back into Shell Select.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/shell-to-end-partnership-with-7-eleven-chain|title=Shell to end partnership with 7-Eleven chain|first=Christopher|last=Tan|date=October 2, 2017|access-date=October 5, 2017|work=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 9,231 7-Eleven stores in the Republic of Korea; with only Japan and [[Thailand]] hosting more stores. The first 7-Eleven store in the Republic of Korea opened in 1989 in [[Songpa-gu]] in [[Seoul]] with a franchise license under the [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte Group]].

==== Taiwan ====

7-Eleven is the largest convenience store chain In [[Taiwan]], and is owned by [[:zh:統一超商|President Chain Store Corporation]] under [[Uni-President Enterprises Corporation]]. The first fourteen stores opened in 1979, and struggled to make a profit. Southland Corporation partnered with Uni-President to modernize the stores. However, business was still slow, and Uni-President opted to stock Asian foods. In 1986, 7-Eleven made its first profit in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Han Cheung|title=Taiwan in Time: The fledgling days of 7-Eleven in Taiwan|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2018/02/04/2003687006/2|access-date=February 4, 2018|work=Taipei Times|date=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5,000th store was opened in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Maranda Hsu|author2=Lilian Wu|title=Taiwan's 5,000th 7-Eleven convenience store opens for business|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201407110031.aspx|access-date=October 29, 2014|work=Focus Taiwan News Channel|date=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, an experimental and unstaffed shop branded the X-Store was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Everington|first1=Keoni|title=7-Eleven Taiwan opens first unmanned 'X-Store'|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3352033|access-date=February 5, 2018|work=Taiwan News|date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7-Eleven announced a plan's to operate a combination store in partnership with [[Domino's Pizza]] in February 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tsai |first1=Peng-min |last2=Kao |first2=Evelyn |title=7-Eleven to sell Domino's pizza |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201902250016.aspx |access-date=February 26, 2019 |agency=Central News Agency |date=February 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Everington |first1=Keoni |title=7-Eleven Taiwan to sell freshly-baked Domino's Pizza |url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3646431 |access-date=February 27, 2019 |work=Taiwan News |date=February 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

The first European 7-Eleven store was opened in [[Stockholm]], Sweden in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;Retro rebrand for 7-Eleven&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.insideretail.com.au/blog/2013/01/28/retro-rebrand-for-7-eleven/ | title=Retro rebrand for 7-Eleven |work=Inside Retail | date=January 28, 2013 | access-date=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7-Eleven stores are now solely located in the Scandinavian region of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Franchise Europe Top 500: 7-Eleven – FranchiseDirect.co.uk|url = http://www.franchisedirect.co.uk/top500/7eleven/1/347/|access-date = April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the [[master franchise]] for 7-Eleven in Scandinavia is Reitan Servicehandel, an arm of the Norwegian retail group, [[Reitan Group]]. After Reitangruppen bought the filling station chain, [[HydroTexaco]] (now YX Energy), in [[Norway]] and Sweden in 2006, it announced that several of the stores at the petrol stations would be rebranded as 7-Elevens and that the petrol would be supplied by Shell. Other stores remain under the YX brand.

==== Denmark ====

[[File:7-Eleven Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|7-Eleven in [[Strøget]], Copenhagen, Denmark]]

The first 7-Eleven store in [[Denmark]] was opened at [[Østerbro]] in Copenhagen on September 14, 1993.

==== Norway ====

[[File:7 eleven Bergen Nygardsgaten.JPG|thumb|7-Eleven in [[Bergen]], Norway]]

The first 7-Eleven store in Norway was opened at [[Grünerløkka]] in Oslo on September 13, 1986. As of January 2018, there are 153 7-Eleven stores in Norway, more than 50% located in Oslo. Norway has the northernmost 7-Eleven in the world, situated in [[Tromsø]].

==== Sweden ====

[[File:7-Eleven på Mårtenstorget i Lund.jpg|thumb|7-Eleven at Mårtenstorget in [[Lund]], Sweden]]

The [[Reitan Group]] has held the license in Sweden since December 1997. In the mid-1990s period, 7-Eleven in Sweden received adverse publicity due to the unfavourable labor contracts offered by its then-licensee, ''Small Shops,'' an American-based company, resulting in many stores being sold and closed down. For a time, there were only 7-Elevens in Stockholm and [[Gothenburg]].

7-Eleven returned to the south of Sweden in 2001, when a convenience store opened in [[Lund]]. Later in the 2000s, the Swedish 7-Eleven chain was involved in controversy when the Swedish TV channel [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] exposed widespread fraud on the part of the Reitan Group in its management of the 7-Eleven franchise, which the Reitan Group eventually admitted to on its website.

On August 27, 2007, the Reitan Group and Shell, announced a ten-year agreement to re-brand some 269 service stations across Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark, as 7-Elevens. The contract meant that 7-Eleven would expand from 77 stores to 189 stores in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Mahony|first1=Paul|title=Shell and 7-Eleven strike store deal|url=https://www.thelocal.se/20070827/8303|website=[[The Local]]|access-date=January 5, 2018|date=August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country now has 187 stores.

==== Former locations: Spain and the United Kingdom ====
7-Eleven was available in [[Spain]] until 2000 with many stores inside [[Repsol]] petrol stations, as well as some other petrol-stations across the country.

During the 1980s, small 7-Eleven convenience stores were common in London and the South East of England. The first shop opened in London, in Sydenham South East London in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-food.com/news/7-eleven-plays-down-uk-re-entry-talk_id126350.aspx|title=US/UK: 7-Eleven plays down UK re-entry talk|date=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company ceased trading operations in 1997, but considered resuming UK trading in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/7-eleven-considers-uk-convenience-market-entry/355962.article|title=7-Eleven considers UK convenience market entry|work=TheGrocer.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

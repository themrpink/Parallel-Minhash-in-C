Multi-agent systems sometimes use speech act labels to express the intent of an agent when it sends a message to another agent. For example, the intent &quot;inform&quot; in the message &quot;inform(content)&quot; may be interpreted as a request that the receiving agent adds the item &quot;content&quot; to its knowledge-base; this is in contrast to the message &quot;query(content)&quot; which may be interpreted (depending on the semantics employed) as a request to see if the item content is currently in the receiving agents knowledge base. There are at least two standardisations of speech act labelled messaging [[KQML]] and [[Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents|FIPA]].

KQML and FIPA are based on the Searlian, that is, psychological semantics of speech acts. [[Munindar P. Singh]] has long advocated moving away from the psychological to a social semantics of speech acts—one that would be in tune with Austin's conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social and Psychological Commitments in Multiagent Systems|url=http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/mpsingh/papers/mas/fall-symp-91-longer.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jones&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/ajijones/ Andrew J. I. Jones]&lt;/ref&gt; has also been a critic of the psychological conception. A recent collection of manifestos by researchers in agent communication reflects a growing recognition in the multiagent systems community of the benefits of a social semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Directions in Agent Communication|url=http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/mpsingh/papers/mas/TIST-13-AC-manifestos.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In political science==
In political science, the [[Copenhagen School (international relations)|Copenhagen School]] adopts speech act as a form of felicitous speech act (or simply 'facilitating conditions'), whereby the speaker, often politicians or players, act in accordance to the truth but in preparation for the audience to take action in the directions of the player that are driven or incited by the act. This forms an observable framework under a specified subject matter from the player, and the audience who are 'under-theorised [would] remain outside of the framework itself, and would benefit from being both brought in and drawn out.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1232/1/WRAP_McDonald_0671572-pais-270709-mcdonald_securitisation_and_construction_of_security_ejir_forthcoming_2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It is because the audience would not be informed of the intentions of the player, except to focus on the display of the speech act itself. Therefore, in the perspective of the player, the truth of the subject matter is irrelevant except the result produced via the audience.&lt;ref&gt;''Barry Buzan, Ole Waever and Jaap de Wilde'' (1998) where he discussed the lens of perseption in speech act''&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of speech acts is prevalent in legal theory since laws themselves can be interpreted as speech acts. Laws issue out a command to their constituents which can be realized as an action. When forming a legal contract, speech acts can be made when people are making or accepting an offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lsolum.typepad.com/legaltheory/2012/03/legal-theory-lexicon-speech-acts.html|title=Legal Theory Lexicon: Speech Acts|website=Legal Theory Blog|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the theory of freedom of speech, some speech acts may not be legally protected. For example, a death threat is a type of speech act and is considered to exist outside of the protection of freedom of speech as it is treated as a criminal act.

==Economic sociology==
In a sociological perspective, Nicolas Brisset adopts the concept of speech act in order to understand how economic models participate in the making and the spreading of representations inside and outside of the scientific field. Brisset argues that models perform actions in different fields (scientific, academic, practical, and political). This multiplicity of fields induces a variety of felicity conditions and types of performed actions. This perspective is a criticism of the essentialism of philosophical modelling studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|date=2018-01-02|title=Models as speech acts: the telling case of financial models|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|volume=25|issue=1|pages=21–41|doi=10.1080/1350178X.2018.1419105|s2cid=148612438|issn=1350-178X|url=http://www.gredeg.cnrs.fr/working-papers/GREDEG-WP-2017-25.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In finance, it is possible to understand mathematical models as speech acts: the notion of &quot;financial Logos&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ribaf.2016.01.022 |title=The financial Logos : The framing of financial decision-making by mathematical modelling |journal=Research in International Business and Finance |volume=37 |pages=597–604 |year=2016 |last1=Walter |first1=Christian }}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined in Walter (2016) as the speech act of mathematical financial risk models. The action of the financial Logos on financial practices is the following: the framing of financial decision-making by risk modelling.

In [[mathematics]], the '''limit inferior''' and '''limit superior''' of a [[sequence]] can be thought of as limiting (i.e., eventual and extreme) bounds on the sequence. They can be thought of in a similar fashion for a [[function (mathematics)|function]] (see [[limit of a function]]). For a set, they are the [[infimum and supremum]] of the set's [[limit point]]s, respectively. In general, when there are multiple objects around which a sequence, function, or set accumulates, the inferior and superior limits extract the smallest and largest of them; the type of object and the measure of size is context-dependent, but the notion of extreme limits is invariant. 
Limit inferior is also called '''infimum limit''', '''limit infimum''', '''liminf''', '''inferior limit''', '''lower limit''', or '''inner limit'''; limit superior is also known as '''supremum limit''', '''limit supremum''', '''limsup''', '''superior limit''', '''upper limit''', or '''outer limit'''.

[[Image:Lim sup example 5.png|right|thumb|300px|An illustration of limit superior and limit inferior. The sequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is shown in blue. The two red curves approach the limit superior and limit inferior of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, shown as dashed black lines. In this case, the sequence ''accumulates'' around the two limits. The superior limit is the larger of the two, and the inferior limit is the smaller of the two. The inferior and superior limits agree if and only if the sequence is convergent (i.e., when there is a single limit).]]

The limit inferior of a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}x_n\quad\text{or}\quad \varliminf_{n\to\infty}x_n.&lt;/math&gt;
The limit superior of a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty}x_n\quad\text{or}\quad \varlimsup_{n\to\infty}x_n.&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition for sequences==
The limit inferior of a sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}x_n := \lim_{n\to\infty}\Big(\inf_{m\geq n}x_m\Big)&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}x_n := \sup_{n\geq 0}\,\inf_{m\geq n}x_m=\sup\{\,\inf\{\,x_m:m\geq n\,\}:n\geq 0\,\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the limit superior of (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty}x_n := \lim_{n\to\infty}\Big(\sup_{m\geq n}x_m\Big)&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty}x_n := \inf_{n\geq 0}\,\sup_{m\geq n}x_m=\inf\{\,\sup\{\,x_m:m\geq n\,\}:n\geq 0\,\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the notations &lt;math&gt;\varliminf_{n\to\infty}x_n:=\liminf_{n\to\infty}x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varlimsup_{n\to\infty}x_n:=\limsup_{n\to\infty}x_n&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used.

The limits superior and inferior can equivalently be defined using the concept of subsequential limits of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=W.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=007054235X|location=New York|pages=56|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An element &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; of the extended real numbers &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''subsequential limit'' of &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;(n_k)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\xi=\lim_{k\to\infty} x_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;E\subset\overline{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all subsequential limits of &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, then 

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty} x_n = \sup E &lt;/math&gt; 

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n=\inf E.&lt;/math&gt;

If the terms in the sequence are real numbers, the limit superior and limit inferior always exist, as the real numbers together with ±∞ (i. e. the [[extended real number line]]) are [[Complete metric space|complete]]. More generally, these definitions make sense in any [[partially ordered set]], provided the [[supremum|suprema]] and [[infimum|infima]] exist, such as in a [[complete lattice]].

Whenever the ordinary limit exists, the limit inferior and limit superior are both equal to it; therefore, each can be considered a generalization of the ordinary limit which is primarily interesting in cases where the limit does ''not'' exist. Whenever lim inf ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and lim sup ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; both exist, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}x_n\leq\limsup_{n\to\infty}x_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Limits inferior/superior are related to [[big-O notation]] in that they bound a sequence only &quot;in the limit&quot;; the sequence may exceed the bound. However, with big-O notation the sequence can only exceed the bound in a finite prefix of the sequence, whereas the limit superior of a sequence like e&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; may actually be less than all elements of the sequence. The only promise made is that some tail of the sequence can be bounded above by the limit superior plus an arbitrarily small positive constant, and bounded below by the limit inferior minus an arbitrarily small positive constant.

The limit superior and limit inferior of a sequence are a special case of those of a function (see below).

== The case of sequences of real numbers ==

In [[mathematical analysis]], limit superior and limit inferior are important tools for studying sequences of [[real number]]s. Since the supremum and infimum of an unbounded set of real numbers may not exist (the reals are not a complete lattice), it is convenient to consider sequences in the [[affinely extended real number system]]: we add the positive and negative infinities to the real line to give the complete [[totally ordered set]] [−∞,∞], which is a complete lattice.

=== Interpretation ===

Consider a sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of real numbers. Assume that the limit superior and limit inferior are real numbers (so, not infinite).
* The limit superior of &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest real number &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that, for any positive real number &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;b+\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, any number larger than the limit superior is an eventual upper bound for the sequence. Only a finite number of elements of the sequence are greater than &lt;math&gt;b+\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
* The limit inferior of &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is the largest real number &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that, for any positive real number &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a natural number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_n&gt;b-\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, any number below the limit inferior is an eventual lower bound for the sequence. Only a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than &lt;math&gt;b-\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Properties ===
[[File:Illustration of Limes superior and Limes Inferior.svg|thumb|300px|In case the sequence is bounded, for all &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; almost all sequence members lie in the open interval &lt;math&gt;(\liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n-\epsilon,\limsup_{n\to\infty} x_n+\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The relationship of limit inferior and limit superior for sequences of real numbers is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty} (-x_n) = -\liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt;

As mentioned earlier, it is convenient to extend &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to [−∞,∞]. Then, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in [−∞,∞] [[limit of a sequence|converges]] [[if and only if]]

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n = \limsup_{n\to\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt;

in which case &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt; is equal to their common value. (Note that when working just in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, convergence to −∞ or ∞ would not be considered as convergence.) Since the limit inferior is at most the limit superior, the following conditions hold

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n = \infty \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; \lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = \infty,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty} x_n = - \infty \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; \lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = - \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;I = \liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S = \limsup_{n\to\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt;, then the interval [''I'', ''S''] need not contain any of the numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, but every slight enlargement [''I''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;ε, ''S''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε] (for arbitrarily small ε &gt; 0) will contain ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all but finitely many indices ''n''. In fact, the interval [''I'', ''S''] is the smallest closed interval with this property. We can formalize this property like this: there exist [[subsequence]]s &lt;math&gt;x_{k_n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{h_n}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;k_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_n&lt;/math&gt; are monotonous) for which we have

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n+\epsilon&gt;x_{h_n} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; x_{k_n} &gt; \limsup_{n\to\infty} x_n-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, there exists a &lt;math&gt;n_0\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; so that for all &lt;math&gt;n\geq n_0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n-\epsilon &lt; x_n &lt; \limsup_{n\to\infty} x_n+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

To recapitulate:

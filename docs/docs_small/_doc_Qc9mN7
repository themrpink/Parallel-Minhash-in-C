Application of the punitive damage rule is further expanded with the enactment of the PRC Law on Tort Liability effective as of July 1, 2010. This new law sets forth that a victim is entitled to claim punitive damages from any manufacturer or seller expressly aware of the defects in products but still produces or sells them if it results in death or heavy injuries. Since this is a somewhat new law so far, no further explanatory regulation regarding a detailed amount and applicable scope is promulgated guiding the application of this rule, so a court judge may have discretional power to decide punitive damages case by case under this new law.

===United States===
Punitive damages are a settled principle of [[common law]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.'' ([[Ford Pinto]] Case), 174 Cal. Rptr. 348 (Cal. Ct. App. 1981) (Tamura, J.), subhead VI.&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally a matter of state law (although they can also be awarded under Federal maritime law), and thus differ in application from state to state. In many states, including [[California]] and [[Texas]], punitive damages are determined based on [[statute]]; elsewhere, they may be determined solely based on case law. Many state statutes are the result of [[insurance]] industry [[lobbying]] to impose &quot;caps&quot; on punitive damages; however, several state courts have struck down these statutory caps as unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=laycock&gt;Douglas Laycock, ''Modern American Remedies'' (Aspen, 2002), p. 732-736.&lt;/ref&gt; They are rare, occurring in only 6% of civil cases that result in a monetary award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conklin|first=Michael|date=2020|title=Factors Affecting Punitive Damage Awards|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3615013|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punitive damages are entirely unavailable under ''any'' circumstances in a few jurisdictions, including Louisiana, Nebraska, Puerto Rico, and Washington.

The general rule is that punitive damages cannot be awarded for breach of contract, but if an independent tort is committed in a contractual setting, punitive damages can be awarded for the tort.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Formosa Plastics Corp. USA v. Presidio Engineers &amp; Contractors, Inc.. 960 S.W.2d 41 (Tex. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Although state laws vary, punitive damages are usually allowed only when the defendant has displayed actual ''intent'' to cause harm (such as purposefully rear-ending someone else's car), rather than in cases of mere [[negligence]], or causes an injury through action taken in [[Recklessness (law)|reckless]] disregard for the lives and safety of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMichael|first1=Benjamin J.|last2=Viscusi|first2=W. Kip|title=The Punitive Damages Calculus: The Differential Incidence of State Punitive Damages Reforms|journal=Southern Economic Journal|date=July 2017|volume=84|issue=1|pages=82–97|doi=10.1002/soej.12217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Punitive damages are a focal point of the [[tort reform]] debate in the United States, where numerous highly publicized multimillion-dollar verdicts have led to a fairly common perception that punitive damage awards tend to be excessive. However, statistical studies by law professors and the Department of Justice have found that punitive damages are only awarded in two percent of civil cases which go to trial, and that the median punitive damage award is between $38,000 and $50,000.&lt;ref name=laycock /&gt;

There is no maximum dollar amount of punitive damages that a defendant can be ordered to pay. In response to judges and juries which award high punitive damages verdicts, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has made several decisions which limit awards of punitive damages through the [[due process of law]] clauses of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. In a number of cases, the Court has indicated that a 4:1 ratio between punitive and compensatory damages is high enough to lead to a finding of constitutional impropriety and that any ratio of 10:1 or higher is almost certainly unconstitutional. However, the Supreme Court carved out a notable exception to this rule of proportionality in the case of ''TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp.'', where it affirmed an award of $10 million in punitive damages, despite the compensatory damages being only $19,000, a punitive-to-compensatory ratio of more than 526 to 1. In this case, the Supreme Court affirmed that disproportionate punitive damages were allowed for especially egregious conduct.&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web | title = TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 US 443 (1993) | url = https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=TXO+Prod.+Corp.+v+Alliance+Resources&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,4&amp;case=7146703882576865947&amp;scilh=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''[[Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants]]'' (1994), 79-year-old Stella Liebeck spilled [[McDonald's]] coffee in her lap which resulted in second and third-degree burns on her thighs, buttocks, groin and genitals. The burns were severe enough to require skin grafts. Liebeck attempted to have McDonald's pay her $20,000 medical bills as indemnity for the incident. McDonald's refused, and Liebeck sued. During the case's [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] process, internal documents from McDonald's revealed the company had received hundreds of similar complaints from customers claiming McDonald's coffee caused severe burns. At trial, this led the jury to find McDonald's knew their product was dangerous and injuring their customers, and that the company had done nothing to correct the problem. The jury decided on $200,000 in compensatory damages, but attributed 20 percent of the fault to Liebeck, reducing her compensation to $160,000. The jury also awarded Liebeck $2.7 million in punitive damages, which was at the time two days of McDonald's coffee sales revenue. The judge later reduced the punitive damages to $480,000. The case is often criticized for the very high amount of damages the jury awarded.  Nevertheless, many legal scholars and documentary film makers like ''[[Hot Coffee (film)|Hot Coffee]]'' argued that corporate lobbyists seized the opportunity to create public misinformation and distrust of the legal system by leaving out important facts in their television advertisements, such as, that the verdict was roughly equivalent to 2 days of coffee sales for McDonald's, that Liebeck received permanent [[Liebeck_v._McDonald's_Restaurants#Burn_incident|injury]] to her genitals and groin requiring surgery, and that McDonald's had already received numerous complaints about the temperature of the coffee. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-story-behind-the-caution-contents-hot-label-2016-10 | title=Here's the story behind the 'Caution: Contents Hot' label on your coffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In ''[[BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore]]'' (1996), the Court ruled that an excessive punitive award can amount to an arbitrary deprivation of property in violation of due process. The Court held that punitive damages must be reasonable, as determined by the degree of reprehensibility of the conduct that caused the plaintiff's injury, the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages, and any comparable criminal or civil penalties applicable to the conduct. In ''[[State Farm Auto. Ins. v. Campbell]]'' (2003), the Court held that punitive damages might only be based on the acts of the defendants which harmed the plaintiffs. The Court also elaborated on the factors courts must apply when reviewing a punitive award under due process principles.

Most recently, in ''[[Philip Morris USA v. Williams]]'' (2007), the Court ruled that punitive damage awards cannot be imposed for the direct harm that the misconduct caused others, but may consider harm to others as a function of determining how reprehensible it was. More reprehensible misconduct justifies a larger punitive damage award, just as a repeat offender in criminal law may be punished with a tougher sentence. Dissenting in the ''Williams'' case, Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] found that the &quot;nuance eludes me&quot;, suggesting that the majority had resolved the case on a distinction that makes no difference.

Punitive damages are subjective by their very nature. Since their purpose is to punish—as opposed to compensate—opinions on how to accomplish this will vary widely among jurors. Regardless, research into punitive damages has revealed some common principles. Wealth of the defendant is positively correlated with large punitive damage awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conklin|first=Michael|date=2020|title=Factors Affecting Punitive Damage Awards|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3615013|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurors either downplay or ignore jury instructions regarding punitive damages determinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conklin|first=Michael|date=2020|title=Factors Affecting Punitive Damage Awards|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3615013|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; and jurors tend to punish defendants who have conducted a cost-benefit analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conklin|first=Michael|date=2020|title=Factors Affecting Punitive Damage Awards|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3615013|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="1869" xml:space="preserve">In [[computer networking]] and [[telecommunications]], '''route flapping''' occurs when a [[Router (computing)|router]] alternately advertises a destination network via one route then another (or as unavailable, and then available again) in quick sequence. 

Route flapping is caused by pathological conditions (hardware errors, software errors, configuration errors, intermittent errors in communications links, unreliable connections, etc.) within the network which cause certain reachability information to be repeatedly advertised and withdrawn. For example, [[link flap]] occurs when an interface on a router has a hardware failure that will cause the router to announce it alternately as &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;.

In networks with [[link-state routing protocol]]s, route flapping will force frequent recalculation of the topology by all participating routers. In networks with [[distance-vector routing protocol]]s, route flapping can trigger routing updates with every state change. In both cases, it prevents the network from [[Convergence (routing)|converging]].

Route flapping can be contained to a smaller area of the network if route aggregation is used. As an aggregate route will not be withdrawn as long as at least one of the aggregated subnets is still valid, a flapping route that is part of an aggregate will not disturb the routers that receive the aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''Navy Directory''', formerly the '''Navy List'''  or '''Naval Register''' is an official list of [[navy|naval]] officers, their ranks and seniority, the ships which they command or to which they are appointed, etc., that is published by the government or naval authorities of a country.

==Background==
The Navy List fulfills an important function in [[international law]] in that warships are required by article 29 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] to be commanded by a [[commissioned officer]] whose name appears in the appropriate service list.{{why|date=June 2016}}

Past copies of the Navy List are also important sources of information for historians and genealogists.

The Navy List for the Royal Navy is no longer published in hard-copy.

The [[Royal Navy]] (United Kingdom) publishes annual lists of active and reserve officers, and biennial lists of retired officers. As of 2015, the Navy List of the Royal Navy has been renamed as the 'Navy Directory'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/directory-Great-Britain-Ministry-Defence/dp/0117731315 |title=The Navy directory 2015 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 22 December 2016 |website=amazon.co.uk |publisher=Royal Navy |access-date=28 July 2019 |quote=Previously known as Navy List. Containing lists of ships, establishments and Officers of the Fleet. On cover and title page: Compiled on the 1st January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent in the [[United States Navy]] is the Naval Register, which is updated online on a continuous basis.  

When a ship is removed from the ''[[Naval Vessel Register]]'' in the United States, or from a naval list of any other country, the ship is said to be &quot;[[:wikt:stricken|stricken]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul.

[[File:LeMisanthrope.jpg|thumb|''[[The Misanthrope|Le Misantrope]]'', 1719 ad.]]
'''Misanthropy''' is the general [[hatred]], dislike, [[distrust]] or [[contempt]] of the [[human species]], [[human behavior]] or [[human nature]]. A '''misanthrope''' or '''misanthropist''' is someone who holds such views or feelings. The word's origin is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words [[wikt:μῖσος|μῖσος]] (''mīsos'', &quot;hatred&quot;) and [[wikt:ἄνθρωπος|ἄνθρωπος]] (''ānthropos'', &quot;man, human&quot;). The condition is often confused with [[asociality]].

== Western culture ==
=== Arts ===
[[Gustave Flaubert]] once declared that he would &quot;die of suppressed rage at the folly of [his] fellow men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFzQdS8N_5IC&amp;pg=PR14|title=The Letters of Gustave Flaubert: 1857-1880|page=xiv|publisher=Harvard University Press|date=1982|isbn=0674526406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misanthropy has also been ascribed to a number of writers of satire, such as [[William S. Gilbert]] (&quot;I hate my fellow-man&quot;) and [[William Shakespeare]] (''[[Timon of Athens]]''). [[Jonathan Swift]] is widely believed to have been misanthropic (see ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'' and, most especially, Book IV of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''). Poet [[Philip Larkin]] has been described as a misanthrope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books-mr-miseryguts-philip-larkins-letters-show-all-the-grim-humour-that-was-a-hallmark-of-his-great-1558190.html|title=Books: Mr Miseryguts: Philip Larkin's letters show all the grim humor that was a hallmark of his great poems, but, as the years pass, they also chart the true depths of his misanthropy and despair|last=Raban|first=Jonathan|newspaper=The Independent|date=October 17, 1992|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Molière]]'s play ''[[The Misanthrope]]'' is one of the more famous French plays on this topic. Less famous, but more contemporary is the 1971 play by Françoise Dorin, ''Un sale égoïste'' (A Filthy Egoist) which takes the point of view of the misanthrope and entices the viewer to understand his motives.

[[Michelangelo]] has been called a misanthrope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1bALBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211|title=Art, Myth and Deviance|page=211|last=Shoham|first=Shlomo Giora|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|date=2008|isbn=978-1443802970}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Van Vliet]] (commonly known as Captain Beefheart) has been described as a misanthrope, with close friend [[Kristine McKenna]] stating that he &quot;thought human beings were the worst species that was ever dreamed up&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/18/local/la-me-captain-beefheart-20101218/2|title=Don Van Vliet dies at 69; avant-garde rock musician known as Captain Beefheart|last=Cromelin|first=Richard|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 18, 2010|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy ===
The [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosopher]] [[Heraclitus]] was by various accounts a misanthrope and a loner who had little patience for human society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Heraclitus_of_Ephesos/|title=Heraclitus_of_Ephesus|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Death by philosophy : the biographical tradition in the life and death of the archaic philosophers Empedocles, Heraclitus, and Democritus|last=1953-|first=Chitwood, Ava|date=2004|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472113887|location=Ann Arbor|pages=80|oclc=54988783}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a fragment, the philosopher complained that &quot;people [were] forever without understanding&quot; of what was, in his view, the nature of reality.

In Western philosophy, misanthropy has been connected to [[social isolation|isolation from human society]]. In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', [[Socrates]] describes a misanthrope in relation to his fellow man: &quot;Misanthropy develops when without art one puts complete trust in somebody thinking the man absolutely true and sound and reliable and then a little later ''discovers'' him to be bad and unreliable ... and when it happens to someone often ... he ends up ... hating everyone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stern| first=Paul| title=Socratic Rationalism and Political Philosophy: An Interpretation of Plato's Phaedo| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJAFnvm2fg4C| year=1993| publisher=SUNY Press| isbn=978-0-7914-1573-3| page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misanthropy, then, is presented as a potential result of thwarted expectations or even excessively naïve optimism, since Plato argues that &quot;art&quot; would have allowed the potential misanthrope to recognize that the majority of men are to be found in between good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;Stern 95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] follows a more [[Ontology|ontological]] route: the misanthrope, as an essentially [[solitude|solitary]] man, is not a man at all: he must be a beast or a god, a view reflected in the [[Renaissance]] view of misanthropy as a &quot;beast-like state&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Jowett| first=John| title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Life of Timon of Athens| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHTKzYKrh6wC| year=2004| publisher=Oxford UP| isbn=978-0-19-281497-5| page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a difference between [[philosophical pessimism]] and misanthropy. [[Immanuel Kant]] said that &quot;Of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing can ever be made&quot;, and yet this was not an expression of the uselessness of mankind itself. Kant further stated that hatred of mankind can take two distinctive forms: aversion from men ([[anthropophobia]]) and enmity towards them.&lt;ref name=&quot;kant191&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author=Immanuel Kant| title=Lectures on Ethics| date=2001-03-19| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-78804-5| page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition can arise partly from dislike and partly from ill-will.&lt;ref name=&quot;kant191&quot;/&gt;

[[Martin Heidegger]] has also been said&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reading Heidegger's Black Notebooks 1931-1941|publisher=|others=Farin, Ingo,, Malpas, Jeff|isbn=0262034018|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=321|oclc=926820993|last1 = Farin|first1 = Ingo|last2 = Malpas|first2 = Jeff|date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to show misanthropy in his concern of the &quot;they&quot;—the tendency of people to conform to one view, which no one has really thought through, but is just followed because, &quot;they say so&quot;. This might be thought of as more a criticism of [[conformity]] than of people in general. Unlike [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], Heidegger was opposed to any systematic ethics; however, in some of his later thought, he does see the possibility of harmony between people, as part of the four-fold, mortals, gods, earth, and sky.

== Middle Eastern thought ==

In the [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)]], the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]], [[Saadia Gaon]], uses the [[Platonism|Platonic]] idea that the self-isolated man is dehumanized by friendlessness to argue against the misanthropy of [[anchorite]] [[asceticism]] and [[Recluse|reclusiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Jewish and Islamic Philosophy: Crosspollinations in the Classic Age|first=Lenn Evan|last=Goodman|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year=1999|isbn=0748612777|pages=25–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pope Paul II''' ({{lang-la|Paulus II}}; 23 February 1417 – 26 July 1471),&lt;ref name=&quot;Papi&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/paolo-ii_(Enciclopedia-dei-Papi)/ |title=PAOLO II |first=Anna |last=Modigliani |encyclopedia=Enciclopedia dei Papi |language=it |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Pietro Barbo''', was head of the [[Catholic Church]] and ruler of the [[Papal States]] 
from 30 August 1464 to his death in 1471. When his maternal uncle [[Eugene IV]] became [[pope]], Barbo switched from training to be a merchant to religious studies. His rise in the Church was relatively rapid. Elected pope in 1464, Paul amassed a great collection of art and antiquities.

==Early life==

Pietro Barbo was born in [[Venice]], the son of Niccolo and Polixena Condulmer Barbo.&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11578a.htm Weber, Nicholas. &quot;Pope Paul II.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 15 May 2020. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was the sister of [[Pope Eugenius IV]] (1431–1447). Through his father he was a member of the noble [[Barbo von Waxenstein (family)|Barbo family]]. His adoption of the spiritual career, after having been trained as a merchant, was prompted by his uncle's election as pope. His consequent promotion was rapid. He became Archdeacon of Bologna, and Bishop of Cervia and of Vicenza, and in 1440 became a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal-deacon]].&lt;ref name=WeberAttribution/&gt; Barbo gained popularity through his generosity. He boasted that if elected pope he would buy each cardinal a villa to escape the summer heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Elia&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Anthony |last=D'Elia|title=A sudden terror: The plot to kill a renaissance pope|publisher=Harvard|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2020}}

After having been [[lay abbot]] of [[Santa Maria in Sylvis]] since 1441, in 1445 he succeeded [[Giuliano Cesarini]] as archpriest of the [[Vatican Basilica]]. Barbo was very influential under Eugene IV, [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], and Calixtus III, but less so under Pius II.&lt;ref name=WeberAttribution/&gt; Barbo had a marked propensity to enjoy dressing up in sumptuous ecclesiastical finery.

==Election==
{{Main|1464 papal conclave}}
Barbo was elected to succeed [[Pope Pius II]] by the [[accessus]] in the first ballot of the [[Papal conclave, 1464|papal conclave of 30 August 1464]]&lt;ref&gt;Pastor vol. IV, p. ii: &quot;The populace assembled in front of the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] received the news with joy.&quot; [[Acclamation]] of a new [[bishop of Rome]] by the people was a custom of the [[early church]] long in abeyance.&lt;/ref&gt; with a majority of fourteen of the nineteen cardinals present. He owed his election in part to the dissatisfaction of some of the cardinals with the policy of his predecessor.&lt;ref name=WeberAttribution&gt;{{catholic|title=Pope Paul II}|inline=1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11578a.htm|last=Weber|first=Nicholas|volume=11|year=1911|accessdate=15 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon taking office, Paul II was to convene an [[ecumenical council]] within three years. But these terms of subscription were modified by Paul II at his own discretion, and this action lost him the confidence of the College of Cardinals. The justification for setting aside the [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]]s, seen to be under way by the Duke of Milan's ambassador as early as 21 September, lay in connecting any abridgement of the Pope's [[absolute monarchy]] in the [[Papal States]] with a consequent abridgement of his sole authority in spiritual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Pastor, vol. IV, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost from his coronation, Paul withdrew and became inaccessible: audiences were only granted at night and even good friends waited a fortnight to see him. His suspiciousness was widely attested.

Paul wore rouge in public.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Elia&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2020}} The story of Cardinal Ammanati that he meant to take the name Formosus II (meaning &quot;handsome&quot;), after [[Pope Formosus]],&lt;ref&gt;Pastor vol 14, p. 16: The chronicler N. della Tuccia says that for half a century no handsomer man had been seen in the Senate or the Church.&lt;/ref&gt; but was persuaded not to, is more often repeated than the story that he was dissuaded from ''Marcus'', being Venetian and the Cardinal of [[San Marco]], because it was also the war-cry of Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Pastor, vol.

==Conflict==

A sore point was his abuse of the practice of creating cardinals ''[[in pectore]]'', without publishing their names. Eager to raise new cardinals to increase the number who were devoted to his interests, but restricted by the terms of the capitulation, which gave the college a voice in the creation of new members, in the winter of 1464–65 Paul created two secret cardinals both of whom died before their names could be published. In his fourth year as Pope, he created eight new cardinals on 18 September 1467. Five were candidates pressed by kings, placating respectively [[James II of Cyprus]], [[Edward IV of England]], [[Louis XI of France]], [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]] and [[Ferdinand I of Naples]]; one was the able administrator of the [[Franciscans]]; and the last two elevated his old tutor and a first cardinal-nephew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/election-sixtusiv.htm |first=Francis A. |last=Burkle-Young |title=The election of Pope Sixtus IV (1471): Background |publisher=Florida International University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104072656/http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/election-sixtusiv.htm |archive-date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two further cardinal-nephews were added on 21 November 1468.&lt;ref&gt;Burkle-Young (&quot;The election of Pope Paul II (1464)&quot;): &quot;The great number of cardinal-nephews created in the reigns of Sixtus IV, Alexander VI, and Julius II were testimony to the effectiveness of Paul II in opening the floodgates.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In a sign of his increasing secretiveness and paranoia, he added two more cardinals secretly at the same consistory, and four more at the beginning of 1471, expecting to reveal them only in his [[Will (law)|testament]].

Tensions came to the fore when in attempting to eliminate redundant offices, Paul II proceeded to annul the College of [[Abbreviator]]s, whose function it was to formulate papal documents; a storm of indignation arose, inasmuch as rhetoricians and poets with [[Renaissance humanism|humanist training]], had long been accustomed to benefiting from employment in such positions. Paul proceeded as well against the [[Roman Academies#Pomponio's Accademia Romana|Roman Academy]]. [[Bartolomeo Platina]] was a member of both and found his papal employment abruptly curtailed.&lt;ref name=Bauer/&gt; He wrote a pamphlet insolently demanding the pope recall his restrictions, and was imprisoned in the winter of 1464, but released four months later.

In February 1468, when Rome was rife with political intrigue fomented by the Roman barons and the neighboring princes, Paul II arrested Platina and other members of the Academy on charges of irreligion, immorality, and an alleged conspiracy to assassinate the Pope. The prisoners were interrogated under torture&lt;ref name=Bauer&gt;{{cite web|last=Bauer|first=Stefan |title=Bartolomeo Sacchi (Platina) |url=http://www.repertoriumpomponianum.it/pomponiani/platina.htm|work=Repertorium Pomponianum |location=Rome | publisher=Roma nel Rinascimento |accessdate=22 November 2013|origyear=2008|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La 'conguira' degli umanisti: Platina e Pomponio Leto|url=http://www.castelsantangelo.com/tl_3a.asp|work=Castel Sant'Angelo|publisher=castelsantangelo.com|accessdate=25 November 2013|location=Rome|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release on 7 July 1469, Platina expected to be again in the employ of Paul II, who, however, declined his services. Platina threatened vengeance and executed his threat, when at the suggestion of [[Pope Sixtus IV]] he later wrote his ''Vitæ Pontificum Platinæ historici liber de vita Christi ac omnium pontificum qui hactenus ducenti fuere et XX'' (1479). Not unaccountably, Platina set forth an unfavorable delineation of the character of Paul II.

Among other things, Platina reported that [[Pius II]] suggested Barbo should have been called ''Maria Pietissima'', as &quot;when he could not obtain what he aimed at by praying, entreating, and requesting, he would join tears to his petitions to make them the sooner believed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Platina, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have suggested the nickname may also have been a possible allusion to a perceived lack of masculinity, reflecting possible [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arno |last=Karlen |author-link=Arno Karlen |title=Sexuality and homosexuality |url=https://archive.org/details/sexualityhomosex00karlrich |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=W.

For centuries it influenced historical opinions until critical research proved otherwise.

Though Platina's writing after the conflict would tarnish the legacy of Paul II, the conflict would prove to have a greater effect on the intellectual environment of Rome. Peter Partner explains, &quot;Probably its most important result was to convince men of letters that cultural conformity would be enforced in Rome.&quot; More tangibly, after the crackdown of Paul II, the [[Roman Academy#The Renaissance|Roman Academy]] took on a more religious flavour, turning in part to theology as a means of legitimizing its pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Partner |first=Peter |title=The Pope's Men: The Papal Civil Service in The Renaissance |year=1990 |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=23–24 |url=https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198219958.001.0001/acprof-9780198219958 |isbn=9780198219958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==

Pope Paul rejected [[George of Poděbrady]] (King George of Bohemia) because he upheld the conventions of the [[Council of Basel]] in favour of the [[Utraquists]]. In August 1465, Paul II summoned George before the Roman tribunal. When the King failed to come, Paul allied himself with the insurgents in Bohemia and released the King's subjects from their oath of allegiance. In December 1466, he pronounced the ban of [[excommunication]] and sentence of deposition against George. George's apologist, Gregory of Heimberg, subsequently accused Paul of immorality, a move that resulted in Gregory's own excommunication.

Just when the King's goodwill disposed the Pope in favor of reconciliation, Paul died suddenly of a heart attack on 26 July 1471. Reports of the death varied. Some claimed he had collapsed from severe indigestion after eating melon in excess.&lt;ref name=&quot;Papi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Zippel |editor-first=Giuseppe |first=Michael |last=Canensius |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9HwuAQAAIAAJ |quote=1471. |title=Le vite di Paolo II di Gaspare da Verona |date=1904 |orig-year=1734 |publisher=Coi Tipi dell'editore S.

==Legacy==
Although Paul II was a committed opponent of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist learning]], he oversaw and approved the introduction of printing into the Papal States, first at [[Subiaco, Lazio|Subiaco]] in 1464 by [[Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim]], and at Rome itself in 1467. The result was that books and other documents became far more numerous and less expensive to procure than the previous handwritten manuscripts. Printing put the materials needed for an advanced education into the hands of more people than ever before, including an increasing number of laypeople. The output of printing presses at this period was, as a matter of course, subject to governmental scrutiny; during Paul II's reign, books produced in the Papal States were largely limited to Latin classical literature and ecclesiastical texts.

The chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]]'s republican and anti-papal temper makes his diary a far from neutral though well-informed witness. But it is certain that although Paul II opposed the [[humanists]], he yet provided for popular amusements: in 1466 he permitted the [[horse racing|horse-race]] that was a feature of [[Carnival]] to be run along the main street, the [[Via Lata (Rome)|Via Lata]], which now became known from this annual event as the [[Via del Corso]]. So that nobody felt left out of the event, the Pope instituted races for boys, adult men, old people and Jews, with appropriate prizes for each group.&lt;ref name=History-4-32&gt;Pastor vol. IV, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He tried as Pope to reduce or stop blood feuds and vendettas in Italy, and to make sure that Jews were treated fairly.&lt;ref name=History-4-33&gt;Pastor vol. IV, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Paul II displayed an extravagant love of personal splendor that gratified his sense of self-importance.&lt;ref name=History-4-16&gt;Pastor vol. IV, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; After his death [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]] and a selected group of cardinals inspected the treasure laid up against expenditures against the Turks: they found 54 silver shells filled with pearls, to a value of 300,000 [[ducat]]s, jewels and gold intended for refashioning, worth another 300,000 ducats, and a magnificent diamond worth 7,000 ducats, which was sent to [[Guillaume d'Estouteville|Cardinal d'Estouteville]] to cover monies he had advanced to the pontiff. The coin was not immediately found.&lt;ref&gt;A cardinal's report to the Duke of Milan's ambassador, related in Pastor vol. IV, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; He had also amassed a collection of 800 gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Money and Beauty: Bankers, Botticelli and the Bonfire of the Vanities |first=Ludovica |last=Sebregondi |publisher=Giunti |location=Florence |year=2012 |isbn=9788809767645}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2020}}

In statecraft, Paul II lacked eminence and achieved nothing of consequence for [[Italy]]. In his own domain, however, he terminated, in 1465, the regime of the [[counts]] of [[Anguillara]].

[[File:H. M. Brock - Gilbert and Sullivan - D'Oyly Carte Opera Company Ruddigore revival 1921 - original.jpg|thumb|500px|The ghost scene, depicted by [[H. M. Brock]] for the first [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] revival in 1921]]
'''''Ruddigore; or, The Witch's Curse''''', originally called '''''Ruddygore''''', is a [[comic opera]] in two acts, with music by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and libretto by [[W. S. Gilbert]].  It is one of the [[Savoy Opera]]s and the tenth of fourteen comic operas written together by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].  It was first performed by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in London on 22 January 1887.

The first night was not altogether a success, as critics and the audience felt that ''Ruddygore'' (as it was originally spelled) did not measure up to its predecessor, ''[[The Mikado]]''.  After some changes, including respelling the title, it achieved a run of 288 performances.  The piece was profitable,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gsarchive.net/ruddigore/html/intro.html Information from the book ''Tit-Willow or Notes and Jottings on Gilbert and Sullivan Operas''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001162103/https://www.gsarchive.net///ruddigore/html/intro.html |date=1 October 2009 }} by Guy H. and Claude A. Walmisley (Privately Printed, Undated, early 20th century)&lt;/ref&gt; and the reviews were not all bad.  For instance, the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' praised the work of both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: &quot;Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun.&quot;&lt;ref name=Illustrated&gt;[http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/ruddigore/rud5.html ''Illustrated London News'' Review of ''Ruddygore'' dated [29&amp;#93; January 1887]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were further changes and cuts, including a new overture, when [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] revived ''Ruddigore'' after the [[First World War]].  Although never a big money-spinner, it remained in the repertoire until the company closed in 1982.  A centenary revival at [[Sadler's Wells]] in London restored the opera to almost its original first-night state.  In 2000, Oxford University Press published a scholarly edition of the score and libretto, edited by Sullivan scholar [[David Russell Hulme]].  This restores the work as far as possible to the state in which its authors left it and includes a substantial introduction that explains many of the changes, with appendices containing some music deleted early in the run.  After the expiration of the British copyright on Gilbert and Sullivan works in 1961, and especially since the Sadler's Wells production and recording, various directors have experimented with restoring some or all of the cut material in place of the 1920s D'Oyly Carte version.

==Background==
[[File:Amédée Forestier - Illustrated London News - Gilbert and Sullivan - Ruddygore (Ruddigore).jpg|thumb|351px|[[Amédée Forestier]]'s illustration of scenes from &quot;Ruddygore&quot; in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', before the name change.]]
After ''[[The Mikado]]'' opened in 1885, Gilbert, as usual, promptly turned his thoughts to finding a subject for a next opera.  Some of the plot elements of ''Ruddigore'' had been introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869), including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ancestors stepping out of their portraits.  [[Heinrich Marschner]]'s 1828 opera, ''[[Der Vampyr]]'', involves a Lord Ruthven who must abduct and sacrifice three maidens or die.&lt;ref&gt;Charnell-White, Michael.  &quot;The Black Arts&quot;, ''The Musical Times'', July 1992, pp. 327–28&lt;/ref&gt;  Locals claim that the Murgatroyd ancestors in ''Ruddigore'' are based on the Murgatroyd family of [[East Riddlesden Hall]], [[West Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.cravenherald.co.uk/2003/10/17/106736.html Article claiming that Murgatroyd family of East Riddlesden Hall is basis for Ruddigore's Murgatroyds]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

The song &quot;I know a youth who loves a little maid,&quot; can be traced back to the Bab Ballad &quot;The Modest Couple&quot;, in which the very shy and proper Peter and Sarah are betrothed but are reluctant to shake hands or sit side by side.&lt;ref name=dark103&gt;Dark and Grey, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  Sir Roderic's Act II song &quot;When the night wind howls&quot; had its forerunner in one of Gilbert's verses published in ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine in 1869:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Fair phantom, come! The moon's awake,
The owl hoots gaily from its brake,
The blithesome bat's a-wing.
Come, soar to yonder silent clouds;
The ether teems with peopled shrouds:
We’ll fly the lightsome spectre crowds,
Thou cloudy, clammy thing!&lt;ref name=dark103 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Ghost to his Ladye Love&quot;, ''Fun'', vol. IX, 14 August 1869&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

The opera also includes and parodies elements of [[melodrama]], popular at the [[Adelphi Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gsarchive.net/ruddigore/html/intro.html |title=Information about Ruddigore from the book &quot;Tit-Willow or Notes and Jottings on Gilbert and Sullivan Operas&quot; by Guy H. and Claude A.

S. Gilbert wrote that he wished that the music had been more comic. See Stedman, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; and so forth.  But Gilbert, in his customary topsy-turvy fashion, turns the moral absolutes of melodrama upside down: The hero becomes evil, the villain becomes good, and the virtuous maiden changes fiancés at the drop of a hat.  The ghosts come back to life, foiling the curse, and all ends happily.

Sullivan delayed in setting ''Ruddigore'' to music through most of 1886.  He had committed to a heavy conducting schedule and to compose a [[cantata]], ''[[The Golden Legend (cantata)|The Golden Legend]]'', for the triennial [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Music Festival]] in October 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 226 and 245&lt;/ref&gt;  He also was squiring [[Fanny Ronalds]] to numerous social functions.  Fortunately, ''[[The Mikado]]'' was still playing strongly, and Sullivan prevailed on Gilbert to delay production of ''Ruddigore''.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;  He got down to business in early November, however, and rehearsals began in December.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Act II ghost scene, it would be impossible for the cast to see Sullivan's baton when the stage was darkened for the Ancestors' reincarnation.  A technological solution was found: Sullivan used a glass tube baton containing a platinum wire that glowed a dull red.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera encountered some criticism from audiences at its opening on 22 January 1887, and one critic wondered if the libretto showed &quot;signs of the failing powers of the author&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/ruddigore/rud1.html &quot;Gilbert and Sullivan's New Opera&quot;, ''The Monthly Musical Record''], 1 February 1887, 17, pp. 41–42, Retrieved on 17 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  After a run shorter than any of the earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas premiered at the Savoy except ''[[Princess Ida]]'', ''Ruddigore'' closed in November 1887 to make way for a revival of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''. To allow the revival of the earlier work to be prepared at the Savoy, the last two performances of ''Ruddigore'' were given at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], on 8 and 9 November.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;At the Play&quot;, ''[[The Observer]]'', 6 November 1887, p. 2 and ''The Times'', 8 November 1887, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not revived in the lifetimes of the composer or author.

[[File:Robin and Rose.gif|thumb|250px|Robin and Rose]]
In the town of Rederring, in [[Cornwall]], a chorus of professional [[bridesmaid]]s frets that there have been no weddings for the last six months. All of the eligible young men are hopeful of a union with Rose Maybud, the prettiest maiden in the village, yet they are too timid to approach her.  The desperate bridesmaids ask Rose's aunt, Dame Hannah, if she would consider marrying, but she has vowed to remain eternally single. Many years previously, she had been betrothed to &quot;a god-like youth&quot; who turned out to be Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, one of the bad [[baronet]]s of Ruddigore. Only on her wedding day had she discovered his true identity.

Dame Hannah tells the bridesmaids about the curse of Ruddigore. Centuries ago, Sir Rupert Murgatroyd, the first Baronet of Ruddigore, had [[witch hunt|persecuted witches]]. One of his victims, as she was  [[burnt at the stake]], cursed all future Baronets of Ruddigore to commit a crime every day, or perish in inconceivable agonies. Every Baronet of Ruddigore since then had fallen under the curse's influence, and died in agony once he could no longer bring himself to continue a life of crime.

After the horrified bridesmaids exit, Dame Hannah greets her niece, Rose, and asks whether there is any young man in the village whom she could love. Rose, who takes her ideas of Right and Wrong from a book of etiquette, replies that all of the young men she meets are either too rude or too shy. Dame Hannah asks particularly about Robin Oakapple, a virtuous farmer, but Rose replies that he is too diffident to approach her, and the rules of etiquette forbid her from speaking until she is spoken to. Robin enters, claiming to seek advice from Rose about &quot;a friend&quot; who is in love. Rose says that she has such a friend too, but Robin is too shy to take the hint. Rose's devotion to etiquette prevents her from taking the first step, and so they part.

Old Adam, Robin's faithful servant, arrives and addresses Robin as Sir Ruthven (pronounced &quot;Rivven&quot;) Murgatroyd.  Robin reveals that he is indeed Sir Ruthven, having fled his home twenty years previously to avoid inheriting the Baronetcy of Ruddigore and its attendant curse.  He tells Adam never to reveal his true identity. Now Richard Dauntless, Robin's foster-brother, arrives after ten years at sea. Robin tells him that he is afraid to declare his love to Rose, and Richard offers to speak to her on his behalf. When Richard sees Rose, however, he falls in love with her himself and proposes immediately. After consulting her book of etiquette, Rose accepts.&lt;ref&gt;The book of etiquette is a parody of the melodramatic device of the Bible left by a dead parent that is regarded as a moral guide and followed literally.  Rose seeks self-serving passages from the book of etiquette much as a biblical literalist (or the devil) finds convenient passages in scripture to justify their actions.

Realising her mistake, Rose breaks her engagement with Richard and accepts Robin.

Mad Margaret appears, [[mad scene|dishevelled and crazed]].  She has been driven to madness by her love for Sir Despard Murgatroyd, the &quot;Bad Baronet.&quot;  She is jealously seeking Rose Maybud, having heard that Sir Despard intends to carry Rose off as one of his daily &quot;crimes.&quot;  Rose tells her, however, that she need not fear, as she is pledged to another.  They leave just in time to avoid the arrival of the Bucks and Blades, who have come to court the village girls, followed by Sir Despard, who proceeds to frighten everyone away. He muses that, although he is forced by the family curse to commit a heinous crime every day, he commits the crime early, and for the rest of the day he does good works. Richard approaches him and discloses that Despard's elder brother Ruthven is alive, calls himself Robin Oakapple, and is going to marry Rose later that day. The elated Despard declares himself free of the curse, as he can now transfer the baronetcy to his brother.

The village gathers to celebrate the nuptials of Rose and Robin.  Sir Despard interrupts, revealing that Robin is his elder brother and must accept his rightful title as the Bad Baronet.  Rose, horrified at Robin's true identity, resolves to marry Despard – who refuses her: now free of the curse, the ex-baronet takes up with his old love and fiancée Mad Margaret, who is ecstatic.  Rose then accepts Richard, as he &quot;is the only one that's left.&quot;  Robin leaves to take up his rightful identity as Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd.

===Act II===
At Ruddigore Castle, Robin (now Sir Ruthven) tries to come to grips with being a bad baronet, a task at which he proves to be spectacularly lacking. Old Adam suggests various evil crimes, but Robin prefers minor acts that are not criminal, but &quot;simply rude&quot;. Richard and Rose enter to ask Robin's consent to their marriage, which he gives grudgingly.

Robin's weak crimes stir his ancestral ghosts from their usual haunt of the castle's portrait gallery. The curse requires them to ensure that their successors are duly committing a crime every day, and to torture them to death if they fail. They inquire as to Robin's compliance with this requirement.  They are not pleased to learn that the newly-recognised baronet's crimes range from the underwhelming (filing a false [[income tax]] return: &quot;Nothing at all&quot;, say the ghosts; &quot;Everybody does that. It's expected of you.&quot;) to the ridiculous (forging his own will and disinheriting his unborn son). Robin's uncle, the late Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, orders him to &quot;carry off a lady&quot; that day or perish in horrible agony.  After the ghosts treat him to a sample of the agonies he would face, Robin reluctantly agrees.  He tells Adam to go to the village and abduct a lady &amp;ndash; &quot;Any lady!&quot;

Despard has atoned for his previous ten years of evil acts and has married Mad Margaret. The two of them now live a calm, dispassionate life of moderately-paid public service. They come to the castle and urge Robin to renounce his life of crime. When Robin asserts that he has done no wrong yet, they remind him that he is morally responsible for all the crimes Despard had done in his stead. Realising the extent of his guilt, Robin resolves to defy his ancestors.

Meanwhile, Adam has complied with Robin's orders but has unfortunately chosen to abduct Dame Hannah.  The dame proves formidable indeed, and Robin cries out for his uncle's protection. Sir Roderic duly appears, recognises his former love and, angered that his former fiancée has been abducted, dismisses Robin.  Left alone, he and Dame Hannah enjoy a brief reunion.  Robin interrupts them, accompanied by Rose, Richard and the bridesmaids. He [[Quibble (plot device)|quibbles]] that, under the terms of the curse, a Baronet of Ruddigore can die only by refusing to commit a daily crime.  Refusing is therefore &quot;tantamount to suicide&quot;, but suicide is, itself, a crime.  Thus, he reasons, his predecessors &quot;ought never to have died at all.&quot;*  Roderic follows this logic and agrees, stating that he is &quot;practically&quot; alive.

Now that Robin is free of the curse, Rose once again drops Richard and happily resumes her engagement to Robin. Roderic and Dame Hannah embrace, while Richard settles for the First Bridesmaid, Zorah.

*''Note:'' In the original ending, all of the ghosts came back to life. In the revised ending substituted by Gilbert after the premiere, only Sir Roderic comes back to life.

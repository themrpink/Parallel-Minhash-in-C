The interface control documents for GLONASS CDMA signals was published in August 2016.&lt;ref name=glonass_icd&gt;[http://russianspacesystems.ru/bussines/navigation/glonass/interfeysnyy-kontrolnyy-dokument/ Russian Space Systems JSC - GLONASS Interface Control Documents] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to GLONASS developers, there will be three open and two restricted CDMA signals. The open signal L3OC is centered at 1202.025 MHz and uses BPSK(10) modulation for both data and pilot channels; the ranging code transmits at 10.23 million [[Chip (CDMA)|chips]] per second, modulated onto the carrier frequency using QPSK with in-phase data and quadrature pilot. The data is error-coded with 5-bit [[Barker code]] and the pilot with 10-bit [[Neuman-Hoffman code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsworld.com/glonass-modernization-12232/|title=GLONASS Modernization|publisher=GPS World|access-date=2 September 2015|date=2 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032222/http://gpsworld.com/glonass-modernization-12232/|archive-date=17 November 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidegnss.com/auto/julyaug11-Dumas.pdf|title=Data|date=2011|website=insidegnss.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open L1OC and restricted L1SC signals are centered at 1600.995 MHz, and open L2OC and restricted L2SC signals are centered at 1248.06 MHz, overlapping with GLONASS FDMA signals. Open signals L1OC and L2OC use [[time-division multiplexing]] to transmit pilot and data signals, with BPSK(1) modulation for data and BOC(1,1) modulation for pilot; wide-band restricted signals L1SC and L2SC use BOC (5, 2.5) modulation for both data and pilot, transmitted in quadrature phase to the open signals; this places peak signal strength away from the center frequency of narrow-band open signals.&lt;ref name=CDMA_2012_ICG/&gt;&lt;ref name=GPSWorld_Nov_2011&gt;[http://www.gpsworld.com/glonass-modernization-12232/ GLONASS Modernization], Yuri Urlichich, Valery Subbotin, Grigory Stupak, Vyacheslav Dvorkin, Alexander Povalyaev, Sergey Karutin, and Rudolf Bakitko, Russian Space Systems, GPS World, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phase-shift keying|Binary phase-shift keying]] (BPSK) is used by standard GPS and GLONASS signals. [[Binary offset carrier modulation|Binary offset carrier]] (BOC) is the modulation used by [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], [[modernized GPS]], and [[BeiDou|BeiDou-2]].

The navigational message of CDMA signals is transmitted as a sequence of text strings. The message has variable size - each pseudo-frame usually includes six strings and contains [[ephemerides]] for the current satellite (string types 10, 11, and 12 in a sequence) and part of the almanac for three satellites (three strings of type 20). To transmit the full almanac for all current 24 satellites, a superframe of 8 pseudo-frames is required. In the future, the superframe will be expanded to 10 pseudo-frames of data to cover full 30 satellites. The message can also contain [[Earth's rotation]] parameters, [[ionosphere]] models, long-term orbit parameters for GLONASS satellites, and [[International Cospas-Sarsat Programme|COSPAS-SARSAT]] messages. The system time marker is transmitted with each string; [[Leap second|UTC leap second]] correction is achieved by shortening or lengthening (zero-padding) the final string of the day by one second, with abnormal strings being discarded by the receiver.&lt;ref name=GPSWorld_Apr_2011&gt;[http://www.gpsworld.com/innovation-glonass-11405/ GLONASS: Developing Strategies for the Future], Yuri Urlichich, Valeriy Subbotin, Grigory Stupak, Vyacheslav Dvorkin, Alexander Povalyaev, and Sergey Karutin. GPS World, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The strings have a version tag to facilitate [[forward compatibility]]: future upgrades to the message format will not break older equipment, which will continue to work by ignoring new data (as long as the constellation still transmits old string types), but up-to-date equipment will be able to use additional information from newer satellites.&lt;ref name=GPSWorld_Nov_2013&gt;[http://gpsworld.com/new-structure-for-glonass-nav-message/ New Structure for GLONASS Nav Message] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212115824/http://gpsworld.com/new-structure-for-glonass-nav-message/|date=12 December 2013}}, Alexander Povalyaev, GPS World, 2 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The navigational message of the L3OC signal is transmitted at 100 bit/s, with each string of symbols taking 3 seconds (300 bits). A pseudo-frame of 6 strings takes 18 seconds (1800 bits) to transmit. A superframe of 8 pseudo-frames is 14,400 bits long and takes 144 seconds (2 minutes 24 seconds) to transmit the full almanac.

The navigational message of the L1OC signal is transmitted at 100 bit/s. The string is 250 bits long and takes 2.5 seconds to transmit. A pseudo-frame is 1500 bits (15 seconds) long, and a superframe is 12,000 bits or 120 seconds (2 minutes).

L2OC signal does not transmit any navigational message, only the pseudo-range codes:

[[Kosmos 2471|Glonass-K1]] test satellite launched in 2011 introduced L3OC signal. Glonass-M satellites produced since 2014 (s/n 755+) will also transmit L3OC signal for testing purposes.

Enhanced Glonass-K1 and [[GLONASS-K2|Glonass-K2]] satellites, to be launched from 2022, will feature a full suite of modernized CDMA signals in the existing L1 and L2 bands, which includes L1SC, L1OC, L2SC, and L2OC, as well as the L3OC signal. Glonass-K2 series should gradually replace existing satellites starting from 2022, when Glonass-M launches will cease.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICG_2016&quot;&gt;[http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/icg/2016/icg11/01.pdf GLONASS Program Update], Ivan Revnivykh, Roscosmos, 11th ICG Meeting, November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;testoyedov-2015&quot;/&gt;

[[Glonass-KM]] satellites will be launched by 2025. Additional open signals are being studied for these satellites, based on frequencies and formats used by existing GPS, Galileo, and [[BeiDou|Beidou/COMPASS]] signals:

* open signal L1OCM using BOC(1,1) modulation centered at 1575.42 MHz, similar to [[L1C|modernized GPS signal L1C]], Galileo signal E1, and Beidou/COMPASS signal B1C;
* open signal L5OCM using BPSK(10) modulation centered at 1176.45 MHz, similar to the GPS [[GPS signals#L5, Safety of Life|&quot;Safety of Life&quot; (L5)]], Galileo signal E5a, and Beidou/COMPASS signal B2a;&lt;ref name=CDMA_2010_insideGNSS&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/1997|title=Russia to Put 8 CDMA Signals on 4 GLONASS Frequencies|magazine=Inside GNSS|date=2010-03-17|access-date=2010-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205054554/http://insidegnss.com/node/1997|archive-date=5 December 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such an arrangement will allow easier and cheaper implementation of multi-standard [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]] receivers.

With the introduction of CDMA signals, the constellation will be expanded to 30 active satellites by 2025; this may require eventual deprecation of FDMA signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/glonass/news/glonass-update-delves-constellation-details-10499|title=GLONASS Update Delves into Constellation Details|publisher=GPS World|access-date=2010-12-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101144902/http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/glonass/news/glonass-update-delves-constellation-details-10499|archivedate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new satellites will be deployed into three additional planes, bringing the total to six planes from the current three—aided by [[System for Differential Correction and Monitoring]] ([[MacAdam ellipse|SDCM]]), which is a [[GNSS augmentation|GNSS augmentation system]] based on a network of ground-based control stations and communication satellites [[Luch 5A]] and [[Luch 5B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-systemnewsglonass-modernization-maybe-six-planes-probably-more-satellites-12490/|title=GLONASS Modernization: Maybe Six Planes, Probably More Satellites|publisher=GPS World |date=10 January 2012|access-date=24 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102235300/http://gpsworld.com/gnss-systemnewsglonass-modernization-maybe-six-planes-probably-more-satellites-12490/|archive-date=2 November 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SDCM_2012&gt;[http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/icg/2012/icg-7/3-2.pdf SDCM status and plans], Grigory Stupak, 7th ICG Meeting, November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The main contractor of the GLONASS program is Joint Stock Company [[Information Satellite Systems Reshetnev]] (ISS Reshetnev, formerly called NPO-PM). The company, located in [[Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Zheleznogorsk]], is the designer of all GLONASS satellites, in cooperation with the [[Institute for Space Device Engineering]] ([[:ru:РНИИ КП]]) and the [[Russian Institute of Radio Navigation and Time]]. Serial production of the satellites is accomplished by the company [[Production Corporation Polyot]] in [[Omsk]].

Over the three decades of development, the satellite designs have gone through numerous improvements, and can be divided into three generations: the original GLONASS (since 1982), GLONASS-M (since 2003) and GLONASS-K (since 2011). Each GLONASS satellite has a [[GRAU]] designation 11F654, and each of them also has the military &quot;Cosmos-NNNN&quot; designation.&lt;ref&gt;''Uragan'', Russian Space Web&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First generation ===
{{main|GLONASS (satellite)}}

The true first generation of GLONASS (also called Uragan) satellites were all three-axis stabilized vehicles, generally weighing {{cvt|1250|kg}} and were equipped with a modest propulsion system to permit relocation within the constellation. Over time they were upgraded to Block IIa, IIb, and IIv vehicles, with each block containing evolutionary improvements.

Six Block IIa satellites were launched in 1985–1986 with improved time and frequency standards over the prototypes, and increased frequency stability. These spacecraft also demonstrated a 16-month average operational lifetime. Block IIb spacecraft, with a two-year design lifetimes, appeared in 1987, of which a total of 12 were launched, but half were lost in launch vehicle accidents. The six spacecraft that made it to orbit worked well, operating for an average of nearly 22 months.

Block IIv was the most prolific of the first generation. Used exclusively from 1988 to 2000, and continued to be included in launches through 2005, a total of 56 satellites were launched. The design life was three years, however numerous spacecraft exceeded this, with one late model lasting 68 months, nearly double.&lt;ref&gt;GLONASS #787, 68.7 operational months; as reported by RSA &quot;GLONASS constellation status&quot; on 6 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Block II satellites were typically launched three at a time from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] using [[Proton-K]] [[Blok D|Blok-DM2]] or Proton-K [[Briz (rocket stage)|Briz-M]] boosters. The only exception was when, on two launches, an [[Etalon (satellite)|Etalon]] [[Satellite geodesy|geodetic reflector satellite]] was substituted for a GLONASS satellite.

=== Second generation ===
{{main|GLONASS-M}}

The second generation of satellites, known as [[GLONASS-M|Glonass-M]], were developed beginning in 1990 and first launched in 2003. These satellites possess a substantially increased lifetime of seven years and weigh slightly more at {{cvt|1480|kg}}. They are approximately {{cvt|2.4|m}} in diameter and {{cvt|3.7|m}} high, with a solar array span of {{cvt|7.2|m}} for an electrical power generation capability of 1600 watts at launch. The aft payload structure houses 12 primary antennas for L-band transmissions. Laser corner-cube reflectors are also carried to aid in precise orbit determination and geodetic research. On-board [[Caesium standard|cesium clocks]] provide the local clock source. Glonass-M includes 31 satellites ranging from satellite index 21 - 92 and with 4 spare active satellites.

A total of 41 second generation satellites were launched through the end of 2013. As with the previous generation, the second generation spacecraft were launched three at a time using [[Proton rocket|Proton-K]] Blok-DM2 or Proton-K Briz-M boosters. Some were launched alone with [[Soyuz-2|Soyuz-2-1b]]/[[Fregat]]

On 30 July 2015, [[Information Satellite Systems Reshetnev|ISS Reshetnev]] announced that it had completed the last GLONASS-M (No. 61) spacecraft and it was putting it in storage waiting for launch, along with eight previously built satellites.&lt;ref name=&quot;issr-20150730&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;itartass-811771&quot;/&gt;

As on 22 September 2017, GLONASS-M No.52 satellite went into operation and the orbital grouping has again increased to 24 space vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/news/russia-increases-glonass-orbital-grouping-24-satellites/|title=Russia increases GLONASS orbital grouping to 24 satellites|date=2017-10-23|publisher=Geospatial World|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third generation ===
{{main|GLONASS-K}}

GLONASS-K is a substantial improvement of the previous generation: it is the first unpressurised GLONASS satellite with a much reduced mass ({{cvt|750|kg}} versus {{cvt|1450|kg}} of GLONASS-M). It has an operational lifetime of 10 years, compared to the 7-year lifetime of the second generation GLONASS-M. It will transmit more navigation signals to improve the system's accuracy — including new CDMA signals in the L3 and L5 bands, which will use modulation similar to modernized GPS, Galileo, and BeiDou. Glonass-K consist of 26 satellites having satellite index 65-98 and widely used in Russian Military space.&lt;ref name=&quot;reshetnev_glonass_history&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rian_scheduled&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20110209/162520205.html|title=Russia to launch Glonass satellite on Feb. 24|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BPW/is_10_21/ai_n56309362/?tag=content;col1|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711083220/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BPW/is_10_21/ai_n56309362/?tag=content;col1|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-11|publisher=GPS World|first=Richard |last=Langley|title=GLONASS forecast bright and plentiful|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new satellite's advanced equipment—made solely from Russian components — will allow the doubling of GLONASS' accuracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ato_glonass&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ato.ru/content/glonass-nearing-completion|title=Glonass nearing completion|journal=Russia &amp; CIS Observer|last=Afanasyev|first=Igor|author2=Dmitri Vorontsov |date=2010-11-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130065842/http://www.ato.ru/content/glonass-nearing-completion|archive-date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the previous satellites, these are 3-axis stabilized, [[nadir]] pointing with dual solar arrays.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The first GLONASS-K satellite was successfully launched on 26 February 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;reshetnev_glonass_history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2007/m2-screen_en.pdf|title=Glonass-K: a prospective satellite of the GLONASS system|publisher=Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems|year=2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713063606/http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/images/File/magazin/2007/m2-screen_en.pdf|archive-date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_russia_launches_satellite&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12587238|title=Russia launches satellite for global navigation system|publisher=BBC News|date=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their weight reduction, GLONASS-K spacecraft can be launched in pairs from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] launch site using the substantially lower cost [[Soyuz-2|Soyuz-2.1b]] boosters or in six-at-once from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] using Proton-K Briz-M launch vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;ato_glonass&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;federal_targeted_program_2002&quot;/&gt;

The system requires 18 satellites for continuous navigation services covering the entire territory of the Russian Federation, and 24 satellites to provide services worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;rianovosti_worldrecord&quot;&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081229/119210306.html Russia to set world record with 39 space launches in 2009], RIA Novosti, Retrieved on 29 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The GLONASS system covers 100% of worldwide territory.

On 2 April 2014, the system experienced a technical failure that resulted in practical unavailability of the navigation signal for around 12 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;izvestia&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://izvestia.ru/news/568647|title=Роскосмос ищет причины сбоя ГЛОНАСС|newspaper=Izvestia|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14–15 April 2014, nine GLONASS satellites experienced a technical failure due to software problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;novaya gazeta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/2014/04/15/99404-sistema-glonass-vyshla-iz-stroya-vtoroy-raz-za-mesyats|title=Система ГЛОНАСС вышла из строя второй раз за месяц|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 2016, three GLONASS satellites experienced a technical failure: the batteries of GLONASS-738 exploded, the batteries of GLONASS-737 were depleted, and GLONASS-736 experienced a stationkeeping failure due to human error during maneuvering. GLONASS-737 and GLONASS-736 are expected to be operational again after maintenance, and one new satellite (GLONASS-751) to replace GLONASS-738 is expected to complete commissioning in early March 2016. The full capacity of the satellite group is expected to be restored in the middle of March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/604492|title=Роскосмос обещает восстановить ГЛОНАСС к середине марта|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

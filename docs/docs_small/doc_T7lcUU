Within cities studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and ex-urban residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. FRANK, L. and PIVOT, G., 1994. Impact of Mixed Use and Density on Three Modes of Travel. Transportation Research Record, 1446, pp. 44-52.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transport Reviews Volume 29 Issue 3 (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt; people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Bagley, M.N. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2002) The impact of residential neighborhood type on travel behavior: A structural equations modeling approach. Annals of Regional Science36 (2), 279.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.&lt;ref&gt;e.g.Handy, S., Cao, X. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2005) Correlation or causality between the built environment and travel behavior? Evidence from Northern California. Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment10 (6), 427-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradox of intensification===
Reviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on travel behaviour Melia ''et al.'' (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Melia | first1 = S. | last2 = Barton | first2 = H. | last3 = Parkhurst | first3 = G. | year = 2011| title = The Paradox of Intensification | url = http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/10555/2/melia-barton-parkhurst_The_Paradox_of_Intensification.pdf | journal = Transport Policy | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 46–52 | doi = 10.1016/j.tranpol.2010.05.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of smart growth. Planning policies which increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.

For example, [[Portland, Oregon]] a U.S. city which has pursued smart growth policies, substantially increased its population density between 1990 and 2000 when other US cities of a similar size were reducing in density. As predicted by the paradox, traffic volumes and congestion both increased more rapidly than in the other cities, despite a substantial increase in transit use.

These findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states &quot;[[Ceteris paribus]], urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs&quot;.

At the citywide level it may be possible, through a range of positive measures to counteract the increases in traffic and congestion which would otherwise result from increasing population densities: [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] in Germany is one example of a city which has been more successful in this respect.

This study also reviewed evidence on the local effects of building at higher densities. At the level of the neighbourhood or individual development positive measures (e.g. improvements to public transport) will usually be insufficient to counteract the traffic effect of increasing population density. This leaves policy-makers with four choices: intensify and accept the local consequences, sprawl and accept the wider consequences, a compromise with some element of both, or intensify accompanied by more radical measures such as parking restrictions, closing roads to traffic and [[carfree zone]]s.

In contrast, the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts reported that its Kendall Square neighborhood saw a 40% increase in commercial space attended by a traffic decrease of 14%.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Car-free commuting push pays off in Kendall Square&quot; Boston Globe, July 25, 2012. http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2012/07/25/in_kendall_square_car_traffic_falls_even_as_the_workforce_soars/&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by CEOs for Cities, &quot;Driven Apart,&quot; showed that while denser cities in the United States may have more congested commutes they are also shorter on average in both time and distance. This is in contrast to cities where commuters face less congestion but drive longer distances resulting in commutes that take as long or longer.&lt;ref&gt;Driven Apart, CEOs for Cities, 2010 {{cite web |url=http://www.ceosforcities.org/research/driven-apart/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031233937/http://www.ceosforcities.org/research/driven-apart |archive-date=2012-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Robert Bruegmann]], professor of art history, architecture, and [[urban planning]] at the University of Illinois at Chicago and author of ''Sprawl: A Compact History'', stated that historical attempts to combat urban sprawl have failed, and that the high [[population density]] of [[Los Angeles]], currently the most dense urban area in the United States, &quot;lies at the root of many of the woes experienced by L.A. today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/la-op-dustup18jun18,0,6392240.story | title=Brawl Over Sprawl | author=Bruegmann, Robert | author-link=Robert Bruegmann | work=[[LA Times]] | date=June 18, 2007 | access-date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wendell Cox]] is a vocal opponent of smart growth policies. He argued before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that, &quot;smart growth strategies tend to intensify the very problems they are purported to solve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendell Cox]], [http://www.heritage.org/Research/SmartGrowth/Test051502.cfm ''Dangers of Smart Growth Planning,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051022130210/http://www.heritage.org/Research/SmartGrowth/Test051502.cfm |date=2005-10-22 }} Testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, [[The Heritage Foundation]], May 15, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Cox and Joshua Utt analyzed smart growth and sprawl, and argued that:&lt;ref&gt;Wendell Cox and Joshua Utt, [http://www.heritage.org/Research/SmartGrowth/bg1770.cfm ''The Costs of Sprawl Reconsidered: What the Data Really Show,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025020652/http://www.heritage.org/Research/SmartGrowth/bg1770.cfm |date=2005-10-25 }} Heritage Foundation ''Backgrounder'' #1770, The Heritage Foundation, June 25, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our analysis indicates that the Current Urban Planning Assumptions are of virtually no value in predicting local government expenditures per capita. The lowest local government expenditures per capita are not in the higher density, slower growing, and older municipalities.

On the contrary, the actual data indicate that the lowest expenditures per capita tend to be in medium- and lower-density municipalities (though not the lowest density); medium- and faster-growing municipalities; and newer municipalities. This is after 50 years of unprecedented urban decentralization, which seems to be more than enough time to have developed the purported urban sprawl-related higher local government expenditures. It seems unlikely that the higher expenditures that did not develop due to sprawl in the last 50 years will evolve in the next 20 - despite predictions to the contrary in The Costs of Sprawl 2000 research.

It seems much more likely that the differences in municipal expenditures per capita are the result of political, rather than economic factors, especially the influence of special interests.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase &quot;smart growth&quot; implies that other growth and development theories are not &quot;smart&quot;. There is debate about whether [[transit-proximate development]] constitutes smart growth when it is not transit-oriented. The [[National Motorists Association]] does not object to smart growth as a whole, but strongly objects to [[traffic calming]], which is intended to reduce automobile accidents and fatalities,&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Transportation - Federal Highway Administration, http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/tcalm/part1.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622084750/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/tcalm/part1.htm |date=2009-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also reduce automobile usage and increase alternate forms of public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;San Mateo County Transport Authority: Alternative Congestion Relief Programs in San Mateo County, http://www.smcta.com/tatsm.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the [[National Center for Public Policy Research]], a self-described [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[think tank]], published an economic study entitled &quot;Smart Growth and Its Effects on Housing Markets: The New Segregation&quot; which termed smart growth &quot;restricted growth&quot; and suggested that smart growth policies disfavor minorities and the poor by driving up housing prices.&lt;ref&gt;Randall J. Pozdena,  [http://www.nationalcenter.org/NewSegregation.pdf ''Smart Growth and its Effects on Housing Markets: The New Segregation''], QuantEcon, Inc., published by the [[National Center for Public Policy Research]], November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] groups, such as the [[Cato Institute]], criticize smart growth on the grounds that it leads to greatly increased land values, and people with average incomes can no longer afford to buy [[houses|detached houses]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Randal O'Toole]], [http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2001/10/otoole.pdf &quot;The Folly of &quot;Smart Growth&quot;&quot;], [[Regulation (magazine)|''Regulation'']], Fall 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Ecological economics|ecological economists]] claim that industrial civilization has already &quot;[[Earth Overshoot Day|overshot]]&quot; the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth, and &quot;smart growth&quot; is mostly an illusion.  Instead, a [[steady state economy]] would be needed to bring human societies back into a necessary balance with the ability of the ecosystem to sustain humans (and other species).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.permatopia.com/growth.html |title=permatopia.com |access-date=2008-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706133449/http://www.permatopia.com/growth.html |archive-date=2008-07-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study released in November 2009 characterized the smart-growth policies in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]] as a failure, concluding that &quot;[t]here is no evidence after ten years that [smart-growth laws] have had any effect on development patterns.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rein 11-2-2009&quot;&gt;Lisa Rein, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/01/AR2009110102470.html?hpid=moreheadlines Study calls Md. smart growth a flop], ''[[The Washington Post]],'' November 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Lewis, Gerrit-Jan Knaap, and Jungyul Sohn, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/pdf/smart_growth_study.pdf &quot;Managing Growth With Priority Funding Areas: A Good Idea Whose Time Has Yet to Come,&quot;] ''Journal of the American Planning Association'', 75:4,457 — 478, Online Publication Date: September 1, 2009, {{doi|10.1080/01944360903192560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors include a lack of incentives for builders to redevelop older neighborhoods and limits on the ability of state planners to force local jurisdictions to approve high-density developments in &quot;smart-growth&quot; areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rein 11-2-2009&quot;/&gt;  Buyers demand low-density development and voters tend to oppose high density developments near them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rein 11-2-2009&quot;/&gt;

Beginning in 2010, groups generally associated with the [[Tea Party movement]] began to identify Smart Growth as an outgrowth of the United Nations [[Agenda 21]] which they viewed as an attempt by international interests to force a &quot;sustainable&quot; lifestyle on the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/15/agenda-21-tea-party_n_1965893.html | title=Tea Party Activists Fight Agenda 21, Seeing Threatening U.N. Plot| newspaper=Huffington Post| date=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However planning groups and even some smart growth opponents counter that Smart Growth concepts and groups predate the 1992 Agenda 21 conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/12/focus-on-agenda-21-should-not-divert-attention-from-homegrown-anti-growth-policies |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019104923/http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/12/focus-on-agenda-21-should-not-divert-attention-from-homegrown-anti-growth-policies |archive-date=2014-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the word &quot;sustainable development&quot; as used in the [[Agenda 21]] report is often misread to mean real estate development when it typically refers to the much broader concept of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] in the United Nations and foreign aid context which addresses a broader slate of economic, health, poverty, and education issues.

Since its origins at the turn of the 12th century, Sassari has been ruled by the [[Giudicato of Torres]], the [[Pisa]]ns, as an independent republic in alliance with [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], by the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] and the [[Spain|Spanish]], all of whom have contributed to Sassari's historical and artistic heritage. Sassari is a city rich in art, [[culture]] and [[history]], and is well known for its  [[palazzo|palazzi]], the [[Fountain of the Rosello]], and its elegant [[neoclassical architecture]], such as Piazza d'Italia (Italy Square) and the Teatro Civico (Civic Theatre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sardegnaturismo.it/index.php?xsl=126&amp;s=2&amp;v=9&amp;c=3242&amp;na=1&amp;n=10&amp;t=1 |title=Neoclassical - Artistic - Itineraries - Sardinia Tourism |publisher=Sardegnaturismo.it |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Sardinia's second most populated city, and the fifth largest [[municipality]] in Italy (547&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), it has a considerable amount of cultural, [[tourism|touristic]], [[commerce|commercial]] and [[politics|political]] importance in the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;sardegna.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sardegna.net/docs/citt%E0/citta_sassari_en.html |title=Sassari - History and culture |publisher=Sardegna.net |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's economy mainly relies on tourism and [[Service (economics)|services]], however also partially on [[research]], [[construction]], [[pharmaceutical]]s and the [[petroleum]] industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;sardegna.net&quot;/&gt;

==Geography==
Sassari is located in north-western Sardinia, at {{convert|225|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].  The area rises up on a wide [[karst]]ic plateau that slopes gently down towards the Gulf of [[Asinara]] and the [[Nurra]] plain. The city is surrounded by a [[green belt]] of thousands of hectares of [[olive]] [[plantation]]s, which from the 19th century have partly replaced the mixed woodlands of [[oak]] and other Mediterranean trees as well as the [[maquis shrubland]]. The thinly populated Nurra Plain, located to the west, occupies the main part of the region of Sassari, while the [[urban agglomeration]], with a population of about 275,000 inhabitants, is located to the south east. The abundance of water, with about 400 springs and [[artesian wells]], has made for much development of [[horticulture]] over the centuries.

=== Prehistory and ancient history===
Although Sassari was founded in the [[early Middle Ages]], the surrounding area has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]] age, and throughout [[ancient history]], by the [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragics]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. &lt;br /&gt;Many archaeological sites and ancient ruins are located inside or around the town: the prehistoric [[step pyramid]] of [[Monte d'Accoddi]], a large number of Nuraghes and [[Domus de Janas]] (Fairy Houses), the ruins of a Roman aqueduct, the ruins of a Roman villa discovered under San Nicholas Cathedral, and a portion of the ancient road that connected the Latin city of [[Porto Torres|Turrys Lybissonis]] with [[Cagliari|Caralis]]. In the locality of ''Fiume Santo'' is also found a fossil site where an ''[[Oreopithecus bambolii]]'', a  prehistoric anthropomorphic primate, was discovered, dated at 8.5 million years.

===Middle Ages===

The origin of the city remains uncertain. Among the theses, according to folk tradition the first village was founded around the 9th-10th century AD by  the inhabitants of the ancient Roman port of ''Turris Lybisonis'' (current [[Porto Torres]]), who sought refuge in the mainland to escape the [[Saracen]] attacks from the sea.

It developed from the merger of a number of separate villages, such as San Pietro di Silki, San Giacomo di Taniga, and San Giovanni di Bosove. The oldest mention of the village is in an 1131 document in the archive of the Monastery of St. Peter in Silki where is cited a guy named ''Jordi de Sassaro'' (George of Sassari), a serf from the nearby village of Bosove. Sassari was sacked by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] in 1166.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt; Immigration continued until, in the early 13th century, it was the most populous city in the [[Giudicato of Torres]], and its last capital. After the assassination of [[Michele Zanche]], the latter's last ruler in 1275, Sassari became subject to the [[Republic of Pisa]] with a semi-independent status.

In 1284 the Pisans were defeated by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] fleet at the [[Battle of Meloria]], and the city was able to free itself: it became the [[Republic of Sassari]], the first and only early independent renaissance city-state of Sardinia, with statutes of its own, allied to Genoa; the Genoese were pleased to see it thus withdrawn from Pisan control. Its statutes of 1316 are remarkable for the leniency of the penalties imposed when compared with the penal laws of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

From 1323 the Republic of Sassari decided to side with the King of Aragon, in whose hands it remained for much of the following centuries, though the population revolted at least three times. The revolts ceased when King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] nominated the town as a Royal Burg, directly ruled by the King and free from feudal taxation, during a period in which it may have been the most populous city in Sardinia. Further attempts made by [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] to conquer the city failed. In 1391 it was conquered by [[Brancaleone Doria]] and [[Marianus V of Arborea]], of the independent Sardinian [[Giudicato of Arborea]], of which it became the last capital.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt; However, in 1420 the city was sold along with the remaining territory for 100,000 [[Florin (Aragonese coin)|florins]] to the Crown of Aragon, replaced by Spain after 1479 on the joining of the Aragonese and Castilian thrones. During the period of Aragonese and then Spanish domination the city was known as ''Sàsser'' in [[Catalan language]] and ''Saçer'' in old [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Renaissance===
The city alternated years of crisis, featuring economic exploitation, the decrease of the [[maritime trade]], made unsafe by the daily raids of [[Saracen]] pirates, political corruption of its rulers, the sacking of Sassari in 1527 by the French, and two plagues in 1528 and 1652, with periods of cultural and economic prosperity. The [[Jesuits]] founded the first Sardinian [[university]] in Sassari in 1562.  In the same year the first printing press was introduced and the ideals of [[Renaissance humanism]] became more widely known. Several artists of the [[Mannerist]] and [[Flanders|Flemish]] schools practiced their art in the city.

===Modern history===

After the end of the Spanish period following the European wars of the early 18th century, the brief period of [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] rule (1708–1717) was succeeded by domination by the Piedmontese, who then took over the Title of [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (1720–1861). In 1795 an anti-feudal uprising broke out in the town, led by the Emissary of the [[List of viceroys of Sardinia|Viceroy]] [[Giovanni Maria Angioy]], a Sardinian civil servant, who later fought unsuccessfully against the [[house of Savoy]]. The city was occupied by troops at the time.  The dynasty of the Piedmontese King of Sardinia went on to the monarchs of Italy. Sassari, along with the rest of Italy, became part of the newly created [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]].

At the end of the 18th century the [[University of Sassari|university]]  was restored. In 1836, after six hundred years, the [[city wall|medieval walls]] were partially demolished, allowing the town to expand. New urban plans were developed, on the model of the capital of the new regime's, ([[Turin]]), with geometric streets and squares.

Sassari became an important industrial center.  In the 19th century it was the second most important town in what was to become the future Italy for the production of [[leather]], and in 1848 the Sassarese entrepreneur [[Giovanni Antonio Sanna]] gained control of the mine at [[Montevecchio]], becoming the third richest man in the new Kingdom of Italy. The first railway was opened in 1872.

In 1877 the old [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] castle was demolished, and on the site the &quot;Caserma La Marmora&quot; was built, where the headquarters of &quot;[[Sassari Mechanized Brigade|Brigata Sassari]]&quot; is still located. Founded in 1915, it still consists mainly of Sardinian soldiers.

At the end of the 19th century new urban developments grew on Cappuccini Hill and to the south of the city,  architecturally dominated by [[Eclecticism]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] styles, which created a movement towards the hybrid experimentation of new local architectural styles, known as the ''Sassarese Liberty''.

During the Fascist dictatorship the town had over fifty thousand inhabitants and new neighbourhoods were built, the most important of these being Monte Rosello and Porcellana, typical examples of [[Fascist architecture|Rationalist Architecture]]. On the other hand, the newspaper ''[[La Nuova Sardegna]]'', considered subversive, was closed down.

During the [[Second World War]] three Allied attempts to bomb the town failed: only the railway station was damaged, and there was only one casualty.

===Passive systems===
MIT researchers have devised a new way of providing cooling on a hot sunny day, using inexpensive materials and requiring no fossil fuel-generated power. The passive system, which could be used to supplement other cooling systems to preserve food and medications in hot, off-grid locations, is essentially a high-tech version of a parasol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A new way to provide cooling without power |url=https://news.mit.edu/2018/device-provides-cooling-without-power-1128 |website=MIT News |access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capacity ratings==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
The refrigeration capacity of a refrigeration system is the product of the [[Evaporator|evaporators]]’ [[enthalpy]] rise and the evaporators’ [[mass flow rate]]. The measured capacity of refrigeration is often dimensioned in the unit of kW or BTU/h. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For commercial and industrial refrigeration systems, the '''kilowatt''' (kW) is the basic unit of refrigeration, except in North America, where both '''[[ton of refrigeration]]''' and BTU/h are used.

A refrigeration system's '''[[coefficient of performance]]''' (CoP) is very important in determining a system's overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use '''performance factor''' (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet volume flow rate. It is important to note that both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads. Moving away from the specified operating conditions can dramatically change a system's performance.

Air conditioning systems used in residential application typically use [[Seasonal energy efficiency ratio|SEER]] (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio)for the energy performance rating. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio|url=http://www.ahrinet.org/Homeowners/Save-Energy/Seasonal-Energy-Efficiency-Ratio|access-date=2020-06-09|website=www.ahrinet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air conditioning systems for commercial application often use EER ([[Energy efficiency ratio|Energy Efficiency Ratio]]) and IEER (Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio) for the energy efficiency performance rating. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Calderone|first1=Anthony Domenic|last2=Hessami|first2=Mir-Akbar|last3=Brey|first3=Stefan|date=2005-01-01|title=Use of Solar Desiccant Air-Conditioning Systems in Commercial Buildings|journal=Solar Energy|pages=71–78|publisher=ASMEDC|doi=10.1115/isec2005-76107|isbn=0-7918-4737-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Lane Poor''' (January 18, 1866 – September 27, 1951) was an [[United States|American]] astronomy professor, noted for his opposition to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]].

==Biography==
He was born on January 18, 1866 in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] to [[Edward Erie Poor]].

He graduated from the [[City College of New York]] and received a [[Ph.D.]] in 1892 from [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Poor became an [[astronomer]] and professor of [[celestial mechanics]] at [[Columbia University]] from 1903 to 1944, when he was named Professor Emeritus. He published several works disputing the evidence for [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lane Poor, ''Gravitation Versus Relativity'', G.P. Putnam, New York (1922).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lane Poor, ''[http://josaa.osa.org Journal of the Optical Society of America]'', V20, p. 173 (1930).&lt;/ref&gt; Poor published a series of papers that reflect objections the theory of relativity.&lt;ref name=Tobey&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobey|first=Ronald C.|title=The American Ideology of National Science, 1919-1930|year=1971|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh Press]]|isbn=978-0822932277|pages=[https://archive.org/details/americanideology0000tobe/page/107 107]–108|url=https://archive.org/details/americanideology0000tobe|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 25 years, Poor was chairman of the admissions committee of the [[New York Yacht Club]]. In addition, he was a fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] and an associate fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].  He served several terms as mayor of [[Dering Harbor, New York|Dering Harbor]] on [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and invented a &quot;line of position computers&quot; for yachting navigation.  At [[Columbia University]], Poor was a teacher of the astronomer [[Samuel Alfred Mitchell|Samuel A. Mitchell]], who went on to become director of the [[Leander McCormick Observatory]] at the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.virginia.edu/research/observatories/26inch/history/mitchell.html Leander McCormick Observatory].&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on September 27, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0112//0000279.000.html Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]'', V112, p. 279 (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/PASP./0064//0000048.000.html Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]'', V64, p. 48 (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth Wolstenholme''', [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC &amp; Bar]] (17 July 1920 – 25 March 2002) was an [[List of British football commentators|English football commentator]] for BBC television in the 1950s and 1960s. In the final moments of the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], he said &quot;[[They think it's all over|some people are on the pitch...they think it's all over....it is now!]]&quot; as [[Geoff Hurst]] scored England's fourth goal. The phrase has become part of [[British popular culture]].

==Early life==
Wolstenholme was born in [[Worsley]], [[Lancashire]]. His family were [[Primitive Methodism|Primitive Methodists]] and his brother attended [[Elmfield College]]. He attended [[Farnworth Grammar School]], where [[Alan Ball, Jr.]] (on whom Wolstenholme commentated in the 1966 World Cup Final) was also a pupil some years later. Wolstenholme began his career as a journalist with a newspaper in [[Manchester]].

===Military service===
As Wolstenholme was a member of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]], he was soon [[Mobilization|called up]] at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. By 1941, he had qualified as a bomber pilot and was posted to [[No. 107 Squadron RAF|107 Squadron]], flying [[Bristol Blenheim]] Mk. IVs out of [[RAF Great Massingham]], [[Norfolk]]. At the start of 1943 he transferred to [[de Havilland Mosquito]] with [[No. 105 Squadron RAF|105 Squadron]], part of [[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Don Bennett]]'s [[No. 8 Group RAF]] [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinder]] Group. 

Wolstenholme completed more than 100 highly hazardous sorties over [[Occupied Europe]] and in May 1944 was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]]. The following year, he won a Bar to his DFC for his continual bravery in raids on Germany in a period of exceptionally heavy [[night fighter]] activity. He finished the war as an acting [[squadron leader]], having spent its last stages working in the RAF's public relations department.

==Sports broadcasting==
After the war, he became a freelance journalist, working for [[BBC Radio]] before moving to television in 1950. He lived in [[Worcester Park]], [[Surrey]]. He covered the [[1959 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final]] between [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] and [[Waterford GAA|Waterford]] for BBC Television, an experience which moved him to describe [[hurling]] as his second-favourite sport in the world after his first love, football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kenneth|last=Wolstenholme|url=http://daltonr.wordpress.com/2007/02/08/52/|title=Why Keep This Great Game Such A Big Secret?|newspaper=Sunday Press|date=13 September 1959|accessdate=8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolstenholme commentated on many [[Association football|English domestic football]] games of the 1950s and 1960s, including the first ever game featured on ''[[Match of the Day]]'' in 1964. He covered the [[FA Cup]] final in 1951 and then every year from 1953 to 1971, the year of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s &quot;double&quot;. For the [[BBC Sport|BBC]] he commentated on the [[1960 European Cup Final]] between [[Real Madrid]] and [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] at [[Hampden Park]], widely regarded as one of the greatest football matches ever played. 

===&quot;They think it's all over&quot;===
Wolstenholme's unscripted delivery in the closing moments of the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] included fourteen words that are among the best known in British sport commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/3020805/Class-of-66-pay-tribute-to-voice-of-football.html |title=Class of '66 pay tribute to voice of football |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[England national football team|England]] leading 3-2 against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], a small pitch invasion took place during injury time just as [[Geoff Hurst]] scored to put England 4–2 ahead. The events prompted Wolstenholme to say:

{{cquote|Some people are on the pitch... [[they think it's all over]]...  it is now!}}
“It is now” was added in an almost matter-of-fact way after Hurst had scored the goal. Since 1966, the phrase &quot;they think it's all over&quot; has become  well known in modern English. Although unrehearsed, and spoken in the particular circumstances of the game, the words echoed to an extent those of German commentator [[Herbert Zimmermann (football commentator)|Herbert Zimmermann]] - &quot;It's over! Over! Over! Germany are the World Champions&quot; - when West Germany won the [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final|1954 World Cup]] against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=It's Over! Over! Over!'|author= Paul Legg|title=History Today|date= July 2014|page= 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the seconds leading up to Hurst’s goal Wolstenholme himself had twice anticipated the match being “all over” as the referee checked his watch and, at one point, put his whistle in his mouth as he waved play on.

===Later career===
After the 1966 World Cup, Wolstenholme continued his broadcasting career in the UK and Europe. In 1967 he travelled to the [[Estádio Nacional]] in [[Lisbon]] to cover [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] overcoming [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] in the [[1967 European Cup Final|European Cup Final]]. A year later, he commentated at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] defeated [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] to take the [[European Cup 1967-68|1968 European Cup]]. He was the BBC's main man at the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], commentating on the final between [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. He left the corporation in 1971 after [[David Coleman]] was installed as the BBC's top commentator, his final BBC commentary being on the [[1971 European Cup Final]] between [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

Wolstenholme later commentated for [[Tyne Tees Television]] in the mid to late 1970s, also presenting the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] region's music show, ''[[Razzmatazz (UK TV series)|Razzmatazz]]'', and guest presenting ''[[CITV]]'' in the 1980s. After doing all three, he went into semi-retirement, but re-appeared on TV to provide reports and occasional features for [[Channel 4]] when they earned rights in the early 1990s to show [[Serie A]] games from [[Italy]]. He also took on an acting role, appearing in the [[BBC Radio 4]] [[comedy]] series ''[[Lenin of the Rovers]]'' as football commentator Frank Lee Brian.

In 1998, Wolstenholme made a special appearance in [[EA Sports]]' videogame ''[[World Cup 98 (video game)|World Cup 98]]'', as the sole commentator on the game's classic World Cup matches, recreations of historic World Cup finals that included sepia-toned renditions of the 1930 and 1938 editions.

==Legacy==
His phrase was used as the title for the sports quiz programme ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]'', on which he once appeared as a guest.

[[Bill Oddie]] wrote a song about Wolstenholme for the BBC Radio comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' which includes the lines: &quot;I'm going Wolsten-home/And you can't get Wolsten ''(worse than)'' him!&quot; In another sketch on ''ISIRTA'' a contestant in a television quiz show was awarded Wolstenholme as a prize.

The words &quot;They think it's all over, it is now&quot; are engraved on a flagstone in the Churchgate area of [[Bolton]] town centre.

==Personal==
In 1944 he married his wife, Joan. She died in 1997. They had two daughters, one of whom predeceased him.

Wolstenholme, who had been a supporter of [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] since childhood, was a guest of honour at the club's final game at [[Burnden Park]] in April 1997. He also narrated the club's ''End of an Era'' video which was released as part of Bolton's move from Burnden Park to the [[Reebok Stadium]].

Wolstenholme lived in [[Galmpton, Torbay]], Devon until his death.

'''Peter III''' ({{OldStyleDate|21 February|1728|10 February}}&amp;nbsp;– {{OldStyleDate|17 July|1762|6 July}}) ({{lang-ru|Пётр III Фëдорович}}, ''Pyotr III Fyodorovich'') was [[Emperor of Russia]] for six months in 1762. He was born in [[Kiel]] as '''Charles Peter Ulrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp''' ({{lang-de|Karl Peter Ulrich von Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorf}}), the only child of [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]] (the son of [[Hedvig Sophia of Sweden]], sister of [[Charles XII]]), and [[Anna Petrovna]] (the elder surviving daughter of [[Peter the Great]]).

The [[Germans|German]]-born Peter could hardly speak Russian and pursued a strongly pro-[[Prussia]]n policy, which made him an unpopular leader. He was deposed by troops loyal to his wife, Catherine, the former Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst, who despite her own German origins was a Russian nationalist. She succeeded him as Empress [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]. Peter died in captivity soon after his overthrow, perhaps with Catherine's approval as part of the coup [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]]. However, another theory is that his death was unplanned, resulting from a drunken brawl with one of his guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Dixon|title=Catherine the Great|publisher=Profile Books|location=London, England|date=2009|ISBN=978-1615237326|pages=124–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his generally poor reputation, Peter made some progressive reforms during his short reign. He proclaimed [[religious freedom]] and encouraged education. He sought to modernize the Russian army.  He abolished the [[secret police]], which had been infamous for its extreme violence, and made it illegal for landowners to kill their serfs without going to court. Catherine reversed some of his reforms and carried through others, notably the annexation of church property.&lt;ref name=&quot;bibliotekar&quot;&gt;[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/7-dinastiya-romanovyh/imperator-petr-3-tretiy.htm Романовы.

==Early life and character==
[[File:Peter III of Russia by Grooth (1740s, Russian museum).jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of Peter III by [[Georg Christoph Grooth]], 1740s]]
Peter was born in [[Kiel]], in the duchy of [[Holstein-Gottorp]]. His parents were [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]] (a nephew of [[Charles XII of Sweden]]), and [[Anna Petrovna]] (a daughter of Emperor [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] and Empress [[Catherine I of Russia]]). His mother died shortly after his birth. In 1739, Peter's father died, and he became [[Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]] as Charles Peter Ulrich ({{Lang-de|Karl Peter Ulrich}}) at the age of 11.

When [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]], his mother's younger sister, became Empress of Russia, she brought Peter from Germany to Russia and proclaimed him her [[heir presumptive]] in the autumn of 1742. Previously in 1742, the 14-year-old Peter was [[Kingdom of Finland (1742)|proclaimed King of Finland]] during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743)]], when Russian troops held Finland. This proclamation was based on his succession rights to territories held by his childless great-uncle, the late [[Charles XII of Sweden]], who also had been [[Grand Duke of Finland]]. About the same time, in October 1742, he was chosen by the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Swedish parliament]] to become heir presumptive to the Swedish throne. However, the Swedish parliament was unaware of the fact that he had also been proclaimed heir presumptive to the throne of Russia, and when their envoy arrived in Saint Petersburg in November, it was too late. It has been reported{{by whom|date=August 2018}} that the underage Peter's succession rights to Sweden were renounced on his behalf. Also in November, Peter converted to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] under the name of Pyotr Feodorovich.

Empress Elizabeth arranged for Peter to marry his second cousin, Sophia Augusta Frederica (later [[Catherine the Great]]), daughter of [[Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst]] and [[Princess Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp]]. The young princess formally converted to [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] and took the name Ekaterina Alexeievna (i.e., Catherine). They married on 21 August 1745. The marriage was not a happy one but produced one son, the future Emperor [[Paul of Russia|Paul]], and one daughter, Anna Petrovna (1757–1759). Catherine later claimed that Paul was not fathered by Peter; that, in fact, they had never consummated the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Farquhar |first=Michael |year=2001 |title=A Treasure of Royal Scandals |page=[https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/88 88] |publisher=Penguin Books |place=New York |ISBN=978-0-7394-2025-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the sixteen years of their residence in [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], Catherine took numerous lovers, while her husband did the same in the beginning.

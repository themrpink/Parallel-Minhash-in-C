In his study of [[Machiavelli]], examining the relationship between prudence and moderation, rhetorician Eugene Garver holds that there is a middle ground between &quot;an ethics of principles, in which those principles univocally dictate action&quot; and &quot;an ethics of consequences, in which the successful result is all&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garver&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Garver |first=Eugene |title=Machiavelli and the History of Prudence |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1987 |isbn=0-299-11080-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His premise stems from Aristotle's theory of virtue as an &quot;intermediate&quot;, in which moderation and compromise embody prudence. Yet, because valorizing moderation is not an active response, prudence entails the &quot;transformation of moderation&quot; into a fitting response, making it a flexible situational norm. Garver also asserts that prudential reasoning differs from &quot;algorithmic&quot; and &quot;[[heuristic]]&quot; reasoning because it is rooted in a political community, the context in which common problems regarding stability and innovation arise and call for prudential reasoning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garver&quot;/&gt;

== In economics ==
&lt;!--[[Saving]] links here --&gt;

Economists describe a [[consumer]] as &quot;prudent&quot; if he or she [[Saving|saves]] more when faced with [[risk]]ier future income. This additional saving is called [[precautionary saving]].

If a risk-averse consumer has a [[utility function]] &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; over consumption ''x'', and if &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Derivative|differentiable]], then the consumer is not prudent unless the third [[derivative]] of utility is positive, that is, &lt;math&gt;
u^{'''}\left(x\right)&gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Sandmo |year=1970 |title=The Effect of Uncertainty on Saving Decisions |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=353–360 |jstor=2296725 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of the precautionary saving motive can be measured by '''absolute prudence''', which is defined as
&lt;math&gt;
-\frac{u^{'''}\left(x\right)}{u^{''}\left(x\right)}
&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, '''relative prudence''' is defined as absolute prudence, multiplied by the level of consumption. These measures are closely related to the concepts of absolute and relative [[risk aversion]] developed by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[John W. Pratt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Kimball |year=1990 |title=Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=53–73 |jstor=2938334 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w2848.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In accounting ==

In [[accounting]], prudence was long considered one of the &quot;fundamental accounting concepts&quot; in its determination of the time for [[revenue recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim31030.htm Tax and accountancy: 'fundamental accounting concepts'], [[HMRC]], UK. Retrieved 2011-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of prudence meant that gains should not be anticipated unless their realisation was highly probable. However, recent developments in [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] have led academic critics to accuse the international standard-setting body [[IASB]] of abandoning prudence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1808094/iasb-abandoned-prudence-professor-warns IASB has abandoned prudence, professor warns], ''[[Accountancy Age]]'', 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK)|British reporting standard]] FRS 18, prudence, along with consistency, was relegated to a &quot;desirable&quot; quality of financial information rather than fundamental concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim31032.htm Tax and accountancy: development of accountancy concepts and new objectives: FRS18], HMRC. Retrieved 2011-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Prudence was rejected for IFRS because it was seen as compromising accounts' neutrality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lords&quot;&gt;Rose Orlik, [http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/analysis/2039988/lords-leap-international-standards Lords took a leap on international standards], ''[[Accountancy Age]]'', 4 April 2011. Retrieved 2011-04-12..&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 report on the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], the British [[House of Lords]] bemoaned the demotion of prudence as a governing principle of accounting and [[Financial audit|audit]]. Their comments, however, were disputed by some leading practitioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lords&quot;/&gt;

'''Jean-Marie Le Pen''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ ma.ʁi lə.pɛn}}; born 20 June 1928) is a French politician who served as President of the [[National Rally|National Front]] from 1972 to 2011. He also served as Honorary President of the National Front from 2011 to 2015.

He graduated from [[University of Paris|faculty of law in Paris]] in 1949. After his time in the military, he studied [[political science]] and law at [[Panthéon-Assas University]].

Le Pen focuses on issues related to [[immigration to France]], the [[European Union]], [[Traditional values|traditional culture and values]], [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]], and [[Economy of France|France's high rate of unemployment]]. His progression in the 1980s is known as the &quot;lepénisation of spirits&quot; due to its noticeable effect on mainstream political opinion. His controversial speeches and his integration into public life have made him a figure who polarizes opinion, considered as the &quot;Devil of the Republic&quot; among his opponents or as the &quot;last samurai in politics&quot; among his supporters.

His longevity in politics and his five attempts to become [[President of France]] have made him a major figure in [[Politics in France|French political life]]. His progress to the second round in the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential election]] left its mark on French public life and the &quot;21st of April&quot; is now a frequently used expression in France. A former [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP), he served as the Honorary President of the National Front from 2011 to 2015. He was expelled from the party by his daughter [[Marine Le Pen]] in 2015, after new controversial statements.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Jean Louis Marie Le Pen was the only son of Jean Le Pen (1901–1942). Jean Le Pen was born in French Brittany, like his ancestors and had started work at the age of 13 on a transatlantic vessel. He was the president of L'Association des Ancients Combattants and Councilor of La Trinité-sur-Mer.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pen, Jean-Marie. p45&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Marie Le Pen's mother, Anne-Marie Hervé (1904–1965) was a seamstress and also of local ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pen, Jean-Marie. p16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;genea&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Marie Le Pen: genealogie|url=https://gw.geneanet.org/pierfit?lang=fr&amp;p=jean+marie&amp;n=le+pen&amp;oc=1|website=geneanet.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Pen was born on 20 June 1928 in [[La Trinité-sur-Mer]], a small seaside village in [[Brittany]], the son of Anne Marie Hervé and Jean Le Pen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linternaute.com/biographie/Jean-Marie-le-pen/ |title=Biographie Jean-Marie Le Pen |publisher=Linternaute.com |date=20 June 1928 |accessdate=21 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816131939/http://www.linternaute.com/biographie/jean-marie-le-pen/ |archive-date=16 August 2016 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a fisherman. He was [[orphan]]ed as an adolescent (''pupille de la nation'', brought up by the state), when his father's boat ''La Persévérance'' was blown up by a mine in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pen, Jean-Marie, p82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;genea&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fauchoux, Marc and Forcari, Christophe. p42&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised as a Roman Catholic and studied at the [[Jesuit]] high school François Xavier in [[Vannes]],&lt;ref&gt;Le Pen, Jean-Marie, p72&lt;/ref&gt; then at the ''[[lycée]]'' of [[Lorient]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Pen, Jean-Marie, p94&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1944, aged 16, he was turned down (because of his age) by Colonel Henri de La Vaissière (then representative of the [[French Communist Party|Communist Youth]]) when he attempted to join the [[French Forces of the Interior]] (FFI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/info/france/elysee_2007/actu.asp?id=10247 Quand Le Pen voulait rejoindre les FFI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001030819/http://www.lexpress.fr/info/france/elysee_2007/actu.asp?id=10247 |date=1 October 2007 }}, ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', 28 March 2007 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then entered the [[University of Paris|faculty of law in Paris]], and started to sell the monarchist ''[[Action Française]]''{{`s}} newspaper, &quot;''Aspects de la France''&quot;, in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/biographies/IVRepublique/le-pen-Jean-Marie-20061928.asp |title=Assemblée nationale&amp;nbsp;– Les députés de la IVe République : Jean-Marie Le Pen |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |date= |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was repeatedly convicted of assault and battery (''coups et blessures'').&lt;ref name = &quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt;

Le Pen started his political career as the head of the student union in [[Toulouse]]. He became president of the ''Association corporative des étudiants en droit'', an association of law students whose main occupation was to engage in street brawls against the &quot;''Cocos''&quot; ([[French Communist Party|communists]]). He was excluded from this organisation in 1951.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

After his time in the military, he studied [[political science]] and law at [[Panthéon-Assas University]]. His graduate thesis, submitted in 1971 by him and Jean-Loup Vincent, was titled ''Le courant anarchiste en France depuis 1945'' or (&quot;The [[The anarchist movement in France since 1945|anarchist movement in France]] since 1945&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IHTTk_iM6jUC&amp;pg=PA235|title=La politique mensonge|last=Schwartzenberg|first=Roger-Gérard|date=1998|publisher=Odile Jacob|isbn=9782738105431|location=|pages=235|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tTSNwAACAAJ|title=Le Courant anarchiste en France depuis 1945|last=Pen|first=Jean-Marie Le|date=1971|publisher=Universite de Paris|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===
After receiving his law degree, he enlisted in the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]]. He arrived in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] after the 1954 [[battle of Dien Bien Phu]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; which had been lost by France and which prompted [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Mendès France]] to put an end to the [[First Indochina War|Indochina war]] at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]]. Le Pen was then sent to [[Suez Crisis|Suez]] in 1956, but arrived only after the cease-fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt;

In 1953, a year before the beginning of the [[Algerian War]], he contacted President [[Vincent Auriol]], who approved Le Pen's proposed volunteer disaster relief project after a [[North Sea flood of 1953|flood in the Netherlands]]. Within two days, there were 40 volunteers from his university, a group that would later help victims of an earthquake in Italy. In Paris in 1956, he was elected to the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] as a member of [[Pierre Poujade]]'s UDCA populist party. Le Pen has often presented himself as the youngest member of the Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jean-Marie Le Pen|title=Biographie|url=http://www.jeanmarielepen.com/p/biographie.html|website=LE BLOG DE Jean-Marie Le Pen|accessdate=9 May 2017|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215093747/http://www.jeanmarielepen.com/p/biographie.html|archive-date=15 February 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a young communist, André Chène, 27 years old and half a year younger, was elected in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sirinelli|first1=Jean-Francois|title=Vie politique française au xxe siècle|date=1995|publisher=Presses universitaires de France|location=Paris, France|pages=573|edition=first|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Le Pen became the General Secretary of the National Front of Combatants, a veterans' organization, as well as the first French politician to nominate a Muslim candidate, Ahmed Djebbour, an Algerian, elected in 1957 as deputy of Paris. The next year, following his break with Poujade, he was reelected to the National Assembly as a member of the [[National Centre of Independents and Peasants|Centre National des Indépendants et Paysans]] (CNIP) party, led by [[Antoine Pinay]].

Le Pen claimed that he had lost his left eye when he was savagely beaten during the [[1958 French legislative election|1958 election]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/04/france.thefarright|title=Battle of Algiers returns to haunt Le Pen as claims of torture focus on far-right leader|last=Paris|first=Giles Tremlett Paul Webster in|date=4 June 2002|work=The Guardian|access-date=27 December 2018|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testimonies suggest that he was only wounded in the right eye and did not lose it. He lost the sight in his left eye years later, due to an illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1391941/Exposing-the-myth-of-poison-Le-Pen.html|title=Exposing the myth of poison Le Pen|last=Broughton|first=Philip Delves|date=22 April 2002|access-date=27 December 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Popular belief is that he wears a [[glass eye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-07-15-8502160018-story.html|title=EX-PARATROOPER AROUSES POLITICAL PASSIONS|last=Tribune|first=Ray Moseley, Chicago|website=Chicago Tribune|access-date=27 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) During the 1950s, Le Pen took a close interest in the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62) and the French defence budget.

Elected deputy of the French Parliament under the [[Pierre Poujade|Poujadist]] banner, Le Pen voluntarily reengaged himself for two to three months in the French Foreign Legion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CatusJack |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/relevance/search/Jean-Marie+Le+Pen+et+La+Torture/video/x446or_jeanmarie-le-pen-et-la-torture-13-e_politics |title=Jean-Marie Le Pen et La Torture [1/3&amp;#93; Excellent !&amp;nbsp;– une vidéo |publisher=Dailymotion |date= |accessdate=13 June 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then sent to [[Algerian War|Algeria]] (1957) as an [[French secret services|intelligence officer]]. He has been accused of having engaged in [[torture during the Algerian War|torture]]. Le Pen has denied these accusations, although he admitted knowing of its use.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt;

===Far-right politics===
Le Pen directed the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential campaign]] of far-right candidate [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], who obtained 5.19% of the votes. He insisted on the rehabilitation of the [[Collaborationist]]s, declaring that:

{{Quote|Was General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] more brave than Marshal [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]] in the occupied zone? This isn't sure. It was much easier to [[French Resistance|resist]] in London than to resist in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt;}}

In 1962, Le Pen lost his seat in the Assembly. He created the Serp (''Société d'études et de relations publiques'') firm, a company involved in the [[music industry]], which specialized in historical recordings and sold recordings of the choir of the [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT]] trade-union and songs of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], as well as [[Nazism|Nazi]] marches.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

===National Front===

In 1972, Le Pen founded the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] (FN) party. He then ran in the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], obtaining 0.74% of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; In 1976, his Parisian flat was dynamited (he lived at that time in his castle of Montretout in Saint-Cloud). The crime was never solved.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; Le Pen then failed to obtain the 500 signatures from &quot;grand electors&quot; (''grands électeurs'', mayors, etc.) necessary to present himself in the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]], won by the candidate of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS), [[François Mitterrand]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Criticizing immigration and taking advantage of the economic crisis striking France and the world since the [[1973 oil crisis]], Le Pen's party managed to increase its support in the 1980s, starting in the municipal elections of 1983. His popularity has been greatest in the south and east of France.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The FN obtained 16 seats in the [[1984 European Parliament election|1984 European elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.europe-politique.eu/elections-europeennes-1984.htm |title=Élections européennes 1984 |last=de Boissieu |first=Laurent |website=europe-politique.eu |access-date=8 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408170619/https://www.europe-politique.eu/elections-europeennes-1984.htm |archive-date=8 April 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 35 FN deputies entered the Assembly after the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 elections]] (the only legislative elections held under proportional representation), which were won by the right wing, bringing [[Jacques Chirac]] to Matignon in the first [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] government (that is, the combination of a right-wing Prime minister, Chirac, with a socialist President, Mitterrand).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} In Paris, Jean-Marie Le Pen was elected in the National Assembly.

In 1984, Le Pen won a seat in the [[European Parliament]] and has been consistently reelected since then. In 1988 he lost his reelection bid for the [[French National Assembly]] in the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]]'s 8th constituency. He was defeated in the second round by [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] Marius Masse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/tribun/fiches_id/2110.asp Marius Masse] biography&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 Le Pen's invite to London by Conservative MPs was militantly protested by large numbers coordinated by the Campaign Against Fascism in Europe, CAFE, which led to a surge of anti-fascist groups and activity across Europe. In 1992 and 1998 he was elected to the [[List of regions in France|regional]] council of [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]].

Le Pen ran in the French presidential elections in 1974, 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2007. As noted above, he was not able to run for office in 1981, having failed to gather the necessary 500 signatures of elected officials. In the [[2002 French presidential election|presidential elections of 2002]], Le Pen obtained 16.86% of the votes in the first round of voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2002/2002109PDR.htm |title=Décision n° 2002-109 PDR du 24 avril 2002 |date=24 April 2002 |website=[[Constitutional Council of France]] |language=fr |access-date=8 April 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was enough to qualify him for the second round, as a result of the poor showing by the PS candidate and incumbent prime minister [[Lionel Jospin]] and the scattering of votes among 15 other candidates. This was a major political event, both nationally and internationally, as it was the first time someone with such far right views had qualified for the second round of the French presidential elections. There was a widespread stirring of national public opinion as virtually the entire French political spectrum from the centre-right to the left united in fierce opposition to Le Pen's ideas. More than one million people in France took part in street rallies; slogans such as &quot;vote for the crook, not the fascist&quot; were heard in opposition to Le Pen.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Le Pen was then defeated by a large margin in the second round, when incumbent president Jacques Chirac obtained 82% of the votes, thus securing the biggest majority in the history of the [[Fifth French Republic|Fifth Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2002/2002111PDR.htm |title=Décision n° 2002-111 PDR du 8 mai 2002 |date=8 May 2002 |website=[[Constitutional Council of France]] |language=fr |access-date=8 April 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]], Le Pen intended to run for office in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]] region but was prevented from doing so because he did not meet the conditions for being a voter in that region: he neither lived there nor was registered as a taxpayer there. However, he was planned to be the FN's top candidate in the region for the [[2010 French regional elections|2010 regional elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontnational.com/?p=1274 |title=FN list of candidates |publisher=Frontnational.com |date=25 August 2008 |accessdate=13 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002190335/http://www.frontnational.com/?p=1274 |archivedate= 2 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Pen again ran in the [[2007 French presidential election]] and finished fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2007/2007139PDR.htm |title=Décision n° 2007-139 PDR du 25 avril 2007 |date=25 April 2007 |website=[[Constitutional Council of France]] |language=fr |access-date=8 April 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2007 campaign, at the age of 78 years and 9 months, makes him the oldest candidate for presidential office in [[History of France|French history]].

Le Pen has been a vocal critic of the European Reform Treaty (formally known as the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]) which was signed by EU member states on 13 December 2007, and entered into force on 1 December 2009.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} In October 2007, Le Pen suggested that he would personally visit Ireland to assist the &quot;No&quot; campaign but finally changed his mind, fearing that his presence would be used against the supporters of the NO vote. Ireland finally refused to ratify the treaty. Ireland is the only EU country which had a citizen referendum. All other EU states, including France, ratified the treaty by parliamentary vote, despite a previous citizen referendum where over 55% of French voters rejected the European Reform Treaty (although that vote was on a different draft of the Treaty in the form of the Constitutional Treaty).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} After the Irish &quot;No&quot; vote, Le Pen addressed the French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] in the [[European Parliament]], accusing him of furthering the agenda of a &quot;cabal of international finance and free market fanatics.&quot; Ireland has since accepted the treaty in a second Lisbon referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8288181.stm|title=Ireland backs EU's Lisbon Treaty|publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=21 October 2009 | date=3 October 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Le Pen left office in January 2011, his daughter [[Marine Le Pen]] was elected by the adherents of the party against [[Bruno Gollnisch]]. He became honorary chairman of the party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/le-corre_france-a-critical-player.pdf|title=FRANCE: A CRITICAL PLAYER IN A WEAKENED EUROPE|last=LE CORRE|first=PHILIPPE|date=April 2017|website=brookings.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won his seat again at the [[2014 European Parliament election in France|European elections in 2014]].

On 4 May 2015, Le Pen was suspended from the party after refusing to attend his disciplinary hearing at the party for describing the gas chambers used in concentration camps during the [[Holocaust]] as a &quot;detail&quot; of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/world/europe/far-right-party-in-france-tries-to-push-jean-marie-le-pen-provocative-founder-to-the-margins.html|title=Far-Right Party in France Tries to Push Jean-Marie Le Pen, Provocative Founder, to the Margins|first1=Alissa J.|last1=Rubin|first2=Aurelien|last2=Breeden|date=4 May 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French court decided in June to cancel this suspension; although the members of the party were to hold a vote to accept or reject a whole series of measures aiming at changing the [[National Front (France)|National Front]]'s status, including Le Pen's Honorary Presidency, on 10 July, another French court ruled to suspend the vote two days beforehand and urged the party to organize an in-person Congress as Le Pen sued the National Front again. The party decided to appeal against both of these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2015/07/08/la-justice-donne-a-nouveau-raison-a-jean-marie-le-pen_4675601_823448.html |title=Jean-Marie Le Pen fait suspendre l'assemblée générale du FN |work=Le Monde |date= |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FN then decided, on 29 July, to count the votes on the suppression of Le Pen's Honorary Presidency, which showed that 94% of the members were in favor of this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Un mot à ajouter ? |url=http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/2015/07/29/fn-94-des-adherents-approuvent-la-suppression-de-la-presidence-d-honneur_1355925 |title=Vote massif des adhérents FN contre Jean-Marie Le Pen, qui renonce à se présenter en Paca |newspaper=Libération |date=29 July 2015 |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/direct/element/_14247/ |title=29 juillet 2015 à 19:40 |newspaper=Libération |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the legal challenges to the FN's removal of Le Pen as its honorary president, he continued to officially hold the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Juridiquement, Jean-Marie Le Pen est toujours président d'honneur du FN | url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/fn/juridiquement-jean-marie-le-pen-est-toujours-president-d-honneur-du-fn_1873324.html | date=27 January 2017 | magazine=[[L'Express]] | accessdate=28 April 2017 | language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Le Pen was expelled from the National Front after a special party congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34009901|title=French National Front expels founder Jean-Marie Le Pen|work=BBC News|date=20 August 2015|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since founded the [[Comités Jeanne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europe1.fr/politique/jean-marie-le-pen-lance-des-comites-jeanne-darc-au-secours-2697814|title=Jean-Marie Le Pen lance des comités &quot;Jeanne d'Arc, au secours !&quot;|website=europe1.fr|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valeursactuelles.com/politique/jean-marie-le-pen-cree-les-comites-jeanne-au-secours-pour-peser-sur-le-fn-60287|title=Jean-Marie Le Pen crée les comités &quot;Jeanne, au secours!&quot; pour peser sur le FN|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life, wealth and security===
[[Image:Le Pen Paris 2007 05 01 n5.jpg|right|thumb|Le Pen with his wife at a political rally in 2007]]

Le Pen's marriage to [[:fr:Pierrette Lalanne|Pierrette Lalanne]] from 29 June 1960 to 18 March 1987 resulted in three daughters; these daughters have given him nine granddaughters. The break-up of the marriage was somewhat dramatic, with his ex-wife posing nude in the French edition of ''[[Playboy]]'' to ridicule him.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; Marie-Caroline, one of his daughters, broke with Le Pen, following her husband to join [[Bruno Mégret]], who split from the FN to found the rival [[National Republican Movement|Mouvement National Républicain]] (MNR, National Republican Movement).&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; The youngest of Le Pen's daughters, [[Marine Le Pen]], is leader of the [[National Front (France)|Front National]]. On 31 May 1991, Jean-Marie Le Pen married Jeanne-Marie Paschos (&quot;Jany&quot;), of [[Greek people|Greek]] descent. Born in 1933, Paschos was previously married to Belgian businessman Jean Garnier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eu.greekreporter.com/2014/06/02/the-greek-french-stepmother-of-marine-le-pen/|title=The Greek-French Stepmother of Marine Le Pen {{!}} Greek Reporter Europe|website=eu.greekreporter.com|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Le Pen inherited a fortune from Hubert Lambert (1934–1976), son of the cement industrialist Leon Lambert (1877–1952), one of three sons of Lambert Cement founder Hilaire Lambert. Hubert Lambert was a political supporter of Le Pen and a [[monarchist]] as well.&lt;ref name=BioRFI/&gt; Lambert's [[Will (law)|will]] provided 30 million francs (approximately 5&amp;nbsp;million euros) to Le Pen, as well as his opulent three-storey 11-room mansion at 8 Parc de Montretout, [[Saint-Cloud]], in the western suburbs of Paris. The home had been built by [[Napoleon III]] for his chief of staff [[Jean-François Mocquard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/francais/actu/articles/081/article_45894.asp Le Pen, son univers impitoyable] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224022357/http://www.rfi.fr/francais/actu/articles/081/article_45894.asp |date=24 February 2012 }}, ''[[Radio France Internationale]]'', 1 September 2006 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nouvelobsricheproprietaire&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Marine Le Pen, une riche propriétaire (comme son père)|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/politique/20160127.OBS3441/marine-le-pen-une-riche-proprietaire-comme-son-pere.html|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=Le Nouvel Observateur|date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his wife, he also owns a two-story townhouse on the Rue Hortense in [[Rueil-Malmaison]] and another house in his hometown of La Trinité-sur-Mer.&lt;ref name=&quot;nouvelobsricheproprietaire&quot;/&gt;

In the early 1980s, Le Pen's personal security was assured by KO International Company, a subsidiary of VHP Security, a [[private security]] firm, and an alleged front organisation for ''SAC'', the ''[[Service d'Action Civique]]'' (Civic Action Service), a Gaullist organisation. SAC allegedly employed figures with organized crime backgrounds and from the far-right movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFI&quot;&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/072/article_40330.asp Le général croate Gotovina arrêté en Espagne], [[Radio France International|RFI]], 8 December 2005 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hum&quot;&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2005-12-10/2005-12-10-819689 Le chauffeur de l’homme de la Question] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118130606/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/2005-12-10/2005-12-10-819689 |date=18 November 2007 }}, ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 10 December 2005 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

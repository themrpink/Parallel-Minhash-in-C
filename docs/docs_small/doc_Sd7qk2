{{History of China}}
The '''Three Kingdoms''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|三国时代}}|t={{linktext|三國時代}}|p=Sānguó Shídài}}) from 220 to 280 AD was the tripartite division of China among the states of [[Cao Wei|Wei]], [[Shu Han|Shu]], and [[Eastern Wu|Wu]].{{sfnp|Theobald|2000}} The Three Kingdoms period started with the end of the [[Han dynasty#Eastern Han|Han dynasty]] and was followed by the [[Jin dynasty (266–420)|Jin dynasty]]. The short-lived [[Yan Kingdom (Three Kingdoms)|Yan kingdom]] in the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], which lasted from 237 to 238, is sometimes considered as a &quot;4th kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kang|first=Youwei|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9rN7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98|title=歐洲十一國遊記二種|date=2013-10-21|publisher=群出版|isbn=|location=|pages=98|language=zh-TW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of the same names, historians have added a relevant character to the state's original name: the state that called itself &quot;Wei&quot; ({{lang|zh-hant|魏}}) is also known as &quot;[[Cao Wei]]&quot; ({{lang|zh-hant|曹魏}}),{{sfnp|San|2014|p=145}} the state that called itself &quot;Han&quot; ({{lang|zh-hant|漢}}) is also known as &quot;[[Shu Han]]&quot; ({{lang|zh-hant|蜀漢}}) or just &quot;Shu&quot; ({{lang|zh-hant|蜀}}), and the state that called itself &quot;Wu&quot; ({{lang|zh-hant|吳}}) is also known as &quot;[[Eastern Wu]]&quot; ({{zh|t=東吳|p=Dōng Wú|labels=no}}) or &quot;Sun Wu&quot; ({{lang|zh-hant|孫吳}}). 

Academically, the period of the Three Kingdoms refers to the period between the foundation of the state of [[Cao Wei|Wei]] in 220 AD and the [[Conquest of Wu by Jin|conquest]] of the state of [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] by the [[Western Jin|Jin dynasty]] in 280. The earlier, &quot;unofficial&quot; part of the period, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic infighting between [[warlord]]s (军阀) in various parts of China. The middle part of the period, from 220 to 263, was marked by a more militarily stable arrangement between three rival states of Wei, Shu, and Wu. The later part of the era was marked by the [[conquest of Shu by Wei]] (263), the usurpation of Wei by the Jin dynasty (265), and the conquest of Wu by the Jin (280).

The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest in Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/whychina/threekingdoms.php&lt;/ref&gt; A nationwide census taken in 280 AD, following the reunification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin shows a total of 2,459,840 households and 16,163,863 individuals which was only a fraction of the 10,677,960 households, and 56,486,856 individuals reported during the Han era.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Di Cosmo and Robin D. S. Yates. Military Culture in Imperial China. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0674031098}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the census may not have been particularly accurate due to a multitude of factors of the times, In 280, the Jin did make an attempt to account for all individuals where they could.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Bielenstein. Chinese historical demography A.D. 2-1982. Östasiatiska museet. p 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advanced significantly during this period. Shu [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] [[Zhuge Liang]] invented the [[wooden ox]], suggested to be an early form of the wheelbarrow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breverton|first1=Terry|authorlink=Terry Breverton|title=Breverton's Encyclopedia of Inventions|date=2013|publisher=Quercus|isbn=978-1623652340|edition=Unabridged}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improved on the [[repeating crossbow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Szczepanski|first1=Kallie|date=|title=The Invention of the Crossbow|url=http://asianhistory.about.com/od/chineseinventions/a/Invention-of-the-Crossbow.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=31 March 2015|website=About.com|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wei mechanical engineer [[Ma Jun]] is considered by many to be the equal of his predecessor [[Zhang Heng]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hong-Sen Yan|title=Reconstruction Designs of Lost Ancient Chinese Machinery|date=2007|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1402064609|edition=Online-Ausg.|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invented a hydraulic-powered, mechanical puppet theatre designed for [[Cao Rui|Emperor Ming of Wei]], square-pallet [[chain pump]]s for irrigation of gardens in [[Luoyang]], and the ingenious design of the [[south-pointing chariot]], a non-magnetic directional compass operated by [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Xiong|first1=Victor Cunrui|title=Historical Dictionary of Medieval China|url=https://archive.org/details/historicaldictio00xion|url-access=limited|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0810860537|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicaldictio00xion/page/n469 351]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although relatively short, this historical period has been greatly romanticized in the cultures of China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kJyDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Although+relatively+short%2C+this+historical+period+has+been+greatly+romanticized+in+the+cultures+of+China%2C+Japan%2C+Korea%2C+and+Vietnam&amp;pg=PT76|title = Chinese History|isbn = 9781921678882|author1 = 佚名|date = January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been celebrated and popularized in operas, folk stories, novels and in more recent times, films, television, and video games. The best known of these is [[Luo Guanzhong]]'s ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', a [[Ming dynasty]] historical novel based on events in the Three Kingdoms period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romance of the Three Kingdoms: China's Greatest Epic 三國志演義|url=http://www.yellowbridge.com/literature/threekingdoms.php|website=Yellow Bridge|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authoritative historical record of the era is [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', along with [[Pei Songzhi]]'s later [[Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms|annotations of the text]].

The English-language term &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; is something of a misnomer, since each state was eventually headed not by a [[king]], but by an [[emperor]] who claimed [[suzerainty]] over all China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tanner|first1=Harold Miles|title=China: A History|date=13 March 2009|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing Company|Hackett Publishing]]|location=[[Indianapolis, Indiana]]|isbn=978-0872209152|pages=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the term &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; has become standard among English-speaking [[Sinology|sinologist]]s.

==Periodization==
{{see also|Timeline of the Three Kingdoms period}}

There is no set time period for the era. Strictly speaking, the Three Kingdoms, or independent states, only existed from 229 with the proclamation of the  [[Eastern Wu]] ruler as emperor until the downfall of [[Shu Han]] in 263. Another interpretation of the period is that it began with the decline of the Han royal house. According to [[Mao Zonggang]], a commentator on the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', in his commentary on Chapter 120 of the novel:

{{quote|The three kingdoms formed when the Han royal house declined. The Han royal house declined when the eunuchs abused the sovereign and officials subverted the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Moss |last=Roberts | title=Three Kingdoms: A Historical Novel | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sc-shy_ZOMkC | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | location=[[California]] | year=1991 | isbn=0-520-22503-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mao Zonggang suggests that the historiography of the Three Kingdoms began with the rise of the [[Ten Eunuchs]]. He further argues that the ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' defines the end of the era as 280, the downfall of Wu, justifying:

{{quote|As the novel focuses on Han, it could have ended with the fall of Han. But Wei usurped Han. To end the tale before Han's enemy had itself met its fate would be to leave the reader unsatisfied. The novel could have ended with the fall of Wei, but Han's ally was Wu. To end the tale before Han's ally had fallen would be to leave the reader with an incomplete picture. So the tale had to end with the fall of Wu.&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts&quot;/&gt;}}

Several other starting points for the period are given by Chinese historians: during the final years of the Han dynasty, such as the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in 184;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Guo Jian (郭建) |title=千秋興亡 |trans-title=Rise and Fall over Thousands of Autumns|publisher= 長春出版社 (Changchun Press) |location=[[Changchun]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Jiang Lang (姜狼) | title=184–280:三國原來這樣|trans-title=184–280: It Turns out the Three Kingdoms Were like This|location=[[Beijing]]|publisher=現代出版社 (Modern Press)|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the year after the beginning of the rebellion, 185;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Han Guopan (韓國磐)| title=魏晉南北朝史綱 |trans-title=Historical Highlights of the Six Dynasties|publisher=人民出版社 (People's Press) | location=[[Beijing]] | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dong Zhuo]] deposing [[Liu Bian|Emperor Shao of Han]] and enthroning [[Emperor Xian of Han]] in 189;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Zhang Binsheng (張儐生) | title=魏晉南北朝政治史 |trans-title=Administrative History of the Six Dynasties| publisher=中國文化大學 (Chinese Culture University Press) | location=[[Taipei]] | year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國經濟通史 魏晉南北朝經濟卷|trans-title=The Complete Economic History of China: Economy of the Six Dynasties|editor=Gao Min (高敏) | publisher=經濟日報出版社 (Economics Daily Press) | location=[[Hong Kong]] | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dong Zhuo sacking [[Luoyang]] and moving the capital to [[Chang'an]] in 190;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國軍事通史 三國軍事史 |trans-title=The Complete Military History of China: Three Kingdoms Military History|author=Luo Kun (羅琨)| publisher=軍事科學出版社 (Military Science Press) | location=[[Beijing]] | year=1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Cao Cao]] placing the emperor under his control in [[Xuchang]] in 196.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=魏晉南北朝社會生活史 |trans-title=The Social History of the Six Dynasties|author=Zhu Dawei (朱大渭)| publisher = 中國社會科學出版社 (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences) | location=[[Beijing]] | year=1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國魏晉南北朝軍事史 |trans-title=China's Six Dynasties Military History|author=Zhang Wenqiang (張文強) | publisher=人民出版社 (People's Press) | location=[[Beijing]] | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國風俗通史 魏晉南北朝卷 |trans-title=The Complete History of Chinese Customs: Six Dynasties|author1= Zhang Chengzong (張承宗) | author2= Wei Xiangdong (魏向東) | publisher=上海藝文出版社 (Shanghai People's Press) | location=[[Shanghai]] | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國魏晉南北朝政治史 （百卷本國全史第7）|trans-title=China's Six Dynasties Administrative History (This Nation's Total History in 100 Volumes, no 7)|author=He Dezhang (何德章)|publisher=人民出版社 (People's Press)|location=[[Beijing]]|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國農業通史 魏晉南北朝卷|trans-title=The Complete History of Chinese Agriculture: Six Dynasties|author=Wang Lihua (王利華)|publisher=中國農業出版社 (Chinese Agricultural Press)|location=[[Beijing]]|year=2009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yellow Turban Rebellion===
{{main|Yellow Turban Rebellion}}

[[File:Han provinces.jpg|thumb|Map of Chinese provinces in the prelude of Three Kingdom period&lt;br/&gt;(In the late Han dynasty period, 189 AD).]]
[[File:Yellow Turban Rebellion.jpg|thumb|Map showing the Yellow Turban Rebellion in Eastern Han Dynasty of China.]]

The power of the Eastern [[Han dynasty]] went into depression and steadily declined from a variety of political and economic problems after the death of [[Emperor He of Han|Emperor He]] in 105 AD. A series of Han emperors ascended the throne while still youths, and &quot;de facto&quot; imperial power often rested with the emperors' older relatives. As these relatives occasionally were loath to give up their influence, emperors would, upon reaching maturity, be forced to rely on political alliances with senior officials and [[eunuch]]s to achieve control of the government. Political posturing and infighting between imperial relatives and eunuch officials was a constant problem in Chinese government at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Theobald|first1=Ulrich|date=28 June 2011|title=The Yellow Turban Uprising|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Terms/huangjin.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=7 March 2015|website=Chinaknowledge|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]] (r. 146–168) and [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]] (r. 168–189), leading officials' dissatisfaction with the eunuchs' usurpations of power reached a peak, and many began to openly protest against them. The first and second protests met with failure, and the court eunuchs persuaded the emperor to execute many of the protesting scholars. Some local rulers seized the opportunity to exert despotic control over their lands and citizens, since many feared to speak out in the oppressive political climate. Emperors Huan and Ling's reigns were recorded as particularly dark periods of Han dynasty rule. In addition to political oppression and mismanagement, China experienced a number of natural disasters during this period, and local rebellions sprung up throughout the country.

In the third month of 184, [[Zhang Jue|Zhang Jiao]], leader of the Way of Supreme Peace, a [[Taoism|Taoist]] movement, along with his two brothers [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] and [[Zhang Bao (Shu Han)|Zhang Bao]], led the movement's followers in a rebellion against the government that was called the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]]. Their movement quickly attracted followers and soon numbered several hundred thousand and received support from many parts of China. They had 36 bases throughout China, with large bases having 10,000 or more followers and minor bases having 6,000 to 7,000, similar to Han armies. Their motto was: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The [[firmament]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Referring to the Han dynasty government}} has perished, the Yellow Sky{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Referring to the Yellow Turban Rebellion}} will soon rise; in this year of ''[[Chinese calendar|jiazi]]'', let there be prosperity in the world!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;({{lang|zh-hant|蒼天已死，黃天當立。歲在甲子，天下大吉。}}){{refn|group=lower-alpha|''[[Book of Han]]'' – ''Record of Emperor Xiaoling'' and the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' -''Guanghe Year 6'' record that Zhang Jiao declared himself Yellow Emperor and took their movement's name from a headscarf worn by followers [yellow signifying the Yellow Emperor and imperial authority].}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Emperor Ling dispatched generals [[Huangfu Song]], [[Lu Zhi (Han dynasty)|Lu Zhi]], and [[Zhu Jun (Han dynasty)|Zhu Jun]] to lead the Han armies against the rebels, and decreed that local governments had to supply soldiers to assist in their efforts. It is at this point that the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' begins its narrative. The Yellow Turbans were ultimately defeated and its surviving followers dispersed throughout China, but due to the turbulent situation throughout the empire, many were able to survive as bandits in mountainous areas, thus continuing their ability to contribute to the turmoil of the era.

With the widespread increase in bandits across the Chinese nation, the Han army had no way to repel each and every raiding party. In 188, Emperor Ling accepted a memorial from [[Liu Yan (Han dynasty warlord)|Liu Yan]] suggesting he grant direct administrative power over feudal provinces and direct command of regional military to local governors, as well as promoting them in rank and filling such positions with members of the Liu family or court officials. This move made [[Zhou (country subdivision)|provinces]] (''zhou'') official administrative units, and although they had power to combat rebellions, the later intra-governmental chaos allowed these local governors to easily rule independently of the central government. Liu Yan was also promoted as governor of [[Yi Province]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Roughly covering the [[Sichuan Basin]]}}. Soon after this move, Liu Yan severed all of his region's ties to the Han imperial court, and several other areas followed suit.

===Dong Zhuo in power===

In the same year, Emperor Ling died, and another struggle began between the court eunuchs for control of the imperial family. Court eunuch [[Jian Shuo]] planned to kill Regent Marshal [[He Jin]], a relative of the imperial family, and to replace the [[crown prince]] [[Liu Bian]] with his younger brother [[Emperor Xian of Han|Liu Xie]], the Prince of Chenliu (in present-day [[Kaifeng]]), though his plan was unsuccessful. Liu Bian took the Han throne as Emperor Shao, and He Jin plotted with warlord [[Yuan Shao]] to assassinate the [[Ten Attendants]], a clique of twelve eunuchs led by [[Zhang Rang]] who controlled much of the imperial court. He Jin also ordered [[Dong Zhuo]], the frontier general in Liang Province, and [[Ding Yuan]], Inspector of Bing Province,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The area between present-day [[Baoding]] and [[Taiyuan]]}} to bring troops to the capital to reinforce his position of authority. The eunuchs learned of He Jin's plot, and had him assassinated before Dong Zhuo reached the capital [[Luoyang]]. When Yuan Shao's troops reached Luoyang, they stormed the palace complex, killing the Ten Attendants and 2,000 of the eunuchs' supporters. Though this move effectively ended the century-long feud between the eunuchs and the imperial family, this event prompted the invitation of Dong Zhuo to the outskirts of Luoyang from the northwest boundary of China.

On the evening of 24 September 189, General Dong Zhuo observed that Luoyang was set ablaze—as a result of a power struggle between the eunuchs and civil service—and commanded his army forward to strike down the disorder.&lt;ref name=cres91-1/&gt; As the emperor had lost any remaining military or political power, Dong Zhuo seized the ''de facto'' control of the government located at Luoyang.&lt;ref name=cres91-1&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September, Dong Zhuo deposed Liu Bian from the imperial Han throne in favour of Liu Xie.&lt;ref name=cres91-1/&gt; In the following weeks, rebellions broke out throughout all of China.&lt;ref name=cres91-1-2/&gt;

In East China, in an attempt to restore the power of the Han, a [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|large coalition against Dong Zhuo]] began to rise, with leaders such as Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu, and Cao Cao.&lt;ref name=cres91-1-2&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many provincial officials were compelled to join or risk elimination.&lt;ref name=cres91-2&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 191, Sun Jian (Yuan Shu's subordinate) led an army against Dong Zhuo and drove him from Luoyang to Chang'an.&lt;ref name=&quot;cres91-2-3&quot;/&gt; In the following year (192), [[Lü Bu]], Dong Zhuo's former bodyguard, assassinated Dong Zhuo.&lt;ref name=cres91-2/&gt; It is said that Dong Zhuo's body was thrown into the street with a lit wick in his naval, which apparently burned with the same brilliance of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;(守尸吏暝以為大炷，置卓臍中以為灯，光明達旦，如是積日。) According to the Annal of Heroes, the light from his corpse could be compared to that of the sun!&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collapse of central power ===
[[File:End of Han Dynasty Warlords.png|thumb|Warlords in the 190s]]
In 192, there was some talk among the coalition of appointing [[Liu Yu (warlord)|Liu Yu]], an imperial relative, as emperor, and gradually its members began to fall out. Most of the warlords in the coalition, with a few exceptions, sought the increase of personal military power in the time of instability instead of seriously wishing to restore the Han dynasty's authority. The Han empire was divided between a number of regional warlords. As a result of the complete collapse of the central government and eastern alliance, the [[North China Plain]] fell into warfare and anarchy with many contenders vying for success or survival.&lt;ref name=cres91-2/&gt; [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] fell into the hands of various warlords in Chang'an.

Dong Zhuo, confident in his success, was slain by his follower [[Lü Bu]], who plotted with minister [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]]. Lü Bu, in turn, was [[Battle of Chang'an|attacked by Dong Zhuo's former officers]]: [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]], [[Guo Si]], [[Zhang Ji (Han dynasty)|Zhang Ji]] and [[Fan Chou]]. Wang Yun and his whole family were executed. Lü Bu fled to [[Zhang Yang (warlord)|Zhang Yang]], a northern warlord, and remained with him for a time before briefly joining Yuan Shao, but it was clear that Lü Bu was far too independent to serve another.

Yuan Shao operated from [[Ye (Hebei)|Ye]] city in [[Ji Province]], extending his power north of the Yellow River.&lt;ref name=cres91-2/&gt; Han Fu had formerly been the Governor of Ji Province, but he came under the control of Yuan Shao and was replaced by him.&lt;ref name=cres91-2-3&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=2–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the Yellow and [[Huai River|Huai]] rivers, a conflict had erupted between Yuan Shu, Cao Cao, [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]] (Governor of [[Xuzhou (ancient China)|Xu Province]]) and Lü Bu.&lt;ref name=cres91-2/&gt; Cao Cao forced the Yellow Turbans to surrender in 192,&lt;ref name=&quot;Crespigny 1991 loc=3–4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; drove Yuan Shu to the south of the Huai River in 193,&lt;ref name=cres91-2/&gt; inflicted devastation upon Tao Qian in 194,&lt;ref name=cres91-2-3/&gt; received the surrender of Liu Bei (then a commander under Tao Qian) in 196,&lt;ref name=cres91-3&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and captured and executed Lü Bu in 198.&lt;ref name=cres91-3/&gt; Cao was now in complete control of the southern part of the North China Plain.&lt;ref name=cres91-3/&gt;

In the northeast, [[Gongsun Du]] held control of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and its environs, where he had established a state.&lt;ref name=cres91-6/&gt; He was succeeded by his son [[Gongsun Kang]] in 204.&lt;ref name=cres91-6/&gt; In the north across the frontier, since the fall of imperial control, the region had become chaotic as the Xiongnu remnants came into conflict with the Xianbei.&lt;ref name=cres91-6&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Goguryeo]] was invaded by warlord [[Gongsun Kang]] in 204, resulting in the [[Daifang Commandery]]. In 209, Kang invaded Goguryeo again, took the capital of Goguryeo and forced them to submit. Goguryeo was forced to move its capital further east.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=988}}  In Liang Province (present-day Gansu), [[Liang Province Rebellion|rebellion had erupted in 184]].&lt;ref name=cres91-6/&gt; In the west, Liu Yan had been Governor of [[Yi Province]] since his appointment in 188.&lt;ref name=cres91-7-8/&gt; He was succeeded by his son Liu Zhang in 194.&lt;ref name=cres91-7-8&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Directly north of Liu Zhang's territory, Zhang Lu (leader of the [[Five Pecks of Rice]]) led a theocratic government at Hanzhong commandary (on the upper Han River).&lt;ref name=cres91-7/&gt; Liu Biao held control over his province as the Governor of Jing Province.&lt;ref name=cres91-7/&gt; Sun Quan held control over the lower Yangtze.&lt;ref name=cres91-7/&gt;

====Xu and Yan provinces====

In 194, Cao Cao went to war with [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]] of Xu Province, because Tao's subordinate Zhang Kai had murdered Cao Cao's father [[Cao Song]]. Tao Qian received the support of [[Liu Bei]] and Gongsun Zan, but even then it seemed as if Cao Cao's superior forces would overrun Xu Province entirely. Cao Cao received word that [[Lü Bu]] had seized Yan Province in his absence, and accordingly he retreated, putting a halt to hostilities with Tao Qian for the time being. Tao Qian died in the same year, leaving his province to Liu Bei. A year later, in 195, Cao Cao managed to drive Lü Bu out of Yan Province. Lü Bu fled to Xu Province and was received by Liu Bei, and an uneasy alliance began between the two.

Afterwards, Lü Bu betrayed Liu Bei and seized Xu Province, forming an alliance with Yuan Shu's remnant forces. Liu Bei, together with his followers [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]], fled to Cao Cao, who accepted him. Soon, preparations were made for an attack on Lü Bu, and the combined forces of Cao Cao and Liu Bei invaded Xu Province. Lü Bu's men deserted him, Yuan Shu's forces never arrived as reinforcements, and he was bound by his own subordinates Song Xian (宋憲) and Wei Xu (魏續) and executed on Cao Cao's order.

====Huai River====
{{Main|Campaign against Yuan Shu}}

Yuan Shu, after being driven south in 193, established himself at his new capital Shouchun (present-day Anhui).&lt;ref name=cres91-3/&gt; He attempted to regain lost territory north of the Huai River.&lt;ref name=cres91-3/&gt; In 197, Yuan Shu declared himself emperor of his own dynasty.&lt;ref name=cres91-3/&gt; The move was a strategic blunder, as it drew the ire of many warlords across the land, including Yuan Shu's own subordinates who almost all abandoned him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crespigny 1991 loc=3–4&quot;/&gt; Abandoned by almost all his allies and followers, he perished in 199.&lt;ref name=cres91-4&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emperor Xian's fate====

In August 195, Emperor Xian fled the tyranny of Li Jue at Chang'an and made a year long hazardous journey east in search of supporters. In 196, Emperor Xian came under the protection and control of Cao Cao after he had succeeded in fleeing from the warlords of Chang'an.&lt;ref name=cres91-4/&gt; Establishing the imperial court at [[Xuchang]] in Henan, Cao Cao—who now held the ''de facto'' control—rigorously followed the formalities of the court and justified his actions as a loyal minister of the Han.&lt;ref name=cres91-4/&gt; By then, most of the smaller contenders for power had either been absorbed by larger ones or destroyed. This was an extremely important move for Cao Cao following the suggestion from his primary adviser, [[Xun Yu]], commenting that by supporting the authentic emperor, Cao Cao would have the formal legal authority to control the other warlords and force them to comply in order to restore the Han dynasty.

====North China Plain====

Cao Cao, whose zone of control was the precursor to the state of Cao Wei, had raised an army in 189. In several strategic movements and battles, he controlled Yan Province and defeated several factions of the Yellow Turban rebels. This earned him the aid of other local militaries controlled by [[Zhang Miao]] and [[Chen Gong]], who joined his cause to create his first sizeable army. He continued the effort and absorbed approximately 300,000 Yellow Turban rebels into his army as well as a number of clan-based military groups from the eastern side of Qing Province.

Since 192, He developed military agricultural colonies (''[[tuntian]]'') to support his army. Although the system imposed a heavy tax on hired civilian farmers (40% to 60% of agricultural production), the farmers were more than pleased to be able to work with relative stability and professional military protection in a time of chaos. This was later said to be his second important policy for success.

In 200, [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]], an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.

After settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.

In the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the [[Battle of Guandu]] (near present-day Kaifeng).&lt;ref name=cres91-4/&gt; Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao.&lt;ref name=cres91-4/&gt; Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.&lt;ref name=cres91-4/&gt;

Cao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north.&lt;ref name=cres91-4/&gt; In 204, after the [[Battle of Ye]], Cao Cao captured the city of [[Ye, China|Ye]].&lt;ref name=cres91-4/&gt; By the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the [[Wuhuan]] culminating in the [[Battle of White Wolf Mountain]], Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the [[North China Plain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=4 &amp; 6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population.&lt;ref name=&quot;cres91-6&quot;/&gt;

====South of the Yangtze====

In 193, Huang Zu led the forces of Liu Biao in a campaign against Sun Jian (Yuan Shu's subordinate general) and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 194, Sun Ce (aged 18) came into the military service under Yuan Shu.&lt;ref name=cres91-7&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the command of some troops who formerly had been commanded by his late father Sun Jian.&lt;ref name=cres91-7/&gt; In the south, he defeated the warlords of [[Yangzhou (ancient China)|Yang Province]], including [[Liu Yao (warlord)|Liu Yao]], [[Wang Lang]], and [[Yan Baihu]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In 198, Sun Ce (aged 23) declared his independence from Yuan Shu who recently had declared himself emperor.&lt;ref name=cres91-7/&gt; He held control over Danyang, Wu, and [[Kuaiji Commandery|Kuaiji]] commandaries (from present-day [[Nanjing]] to the [[Hangzhou Bay]] and some outposts at the [[Fujian]] coast), while expanding westward in a series of campaigns.&lt;ref name=cres91-7/&gt; By 200, he had conquered Yuzhang commandary (at present-day [[Lake Poyang]] in [[Jiangxi]]) and Lujiang (north of the Yangtze).&lt;ref name=cres91-7/&gt; In 200, Sun Ce was ambushed and assassinated by the former retainers of a defeated rival from Wu.&lt;ref name=cres91-8&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sun Quan]] (aged 18) succeeded him and quickly established his authority.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; By 203, he was expanding westward.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; In 208, Sun Quan defeated Huang Zu (Liu Biao's subordinate commander) around present-day Wuhan.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; He now held control over the territories south of the Yangtze (below Wuhan, Poyang region, and Hangzhou Bay).&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; His navy established local superiority over the Yangtze.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; Nevertheless, he would soon come under the threat of Cao Cao's larger armies.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt;

====Jing Province====

During Dong Zhuo's reign over the Han government, [[Liu Biao]] had been appointed as the Governor of Jing Province.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; His territory was located around his capital Xiangyang and the territory to the south around the Han and Yangtze River.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; Beyond his eastern border was the territory of Sun Quan.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt;

In 200, during the time of the campaign around Guandu between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao, Liu Bei's forces had been defeated by a detachment of Cao Cao's army, forcing Liu Bei to flee and seek refuge with Liu Biao in [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]].&lt;ref name=cres91-21&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this exile, Liu Bei maintained his followers who had accompanied him and made new connections within Liu Biao's entourage.&lt;ref name=cres91-21/&gt; It was during this time that Liu Bei also met Zhuge Liang.&lt;ref name=cres91-21/&gt;

In the autumn of 208, Liu Biao died and was succeeded by his youngest son [[Liu Cong (Han dynasty)|Liu Cong]] over the eldest son [[Liu Qi (Liu Biao's son)|Liu Qi]] through political maneuvering.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; Liu Bei had become the head of the opposition to a surrender when Cao Cao's army marched southward to Jing.&lt;ref name=cres91-21/&gt; After the advice of his supporters, Liu Cong surrendered to Cao Cao.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; Cao Cao took control of the province and began appointing scholars and officials from Liu Biao's court to the local government.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; Meanwhile, Liu Qi had joined Liu Bei to establish a line of defence at the Yangtze River against the surrender to Cao Cao, but they suffered defeat at the hands of Cao Cao.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=8 &amp; 21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, they retreated and sought support from Sun Quan.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; Guan Yu (Liu Bei's subordinate lieutenant) had managed to retrieve most of Jing Province's fleet from the Han River.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; Cao Cao occupied the naval base at Jiangling on the Yangtze River.&lt;ref name=cres91-8/&gt; He would now begin proceeding eastwards towards Sun Quan with his armies and new fleet, while sending messengers to demand Sun Quan's surrender.&lt;ref name=cres91-9&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EJB 3.2, final release (2013-05-28)'''

[http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=345 JSR 345]. Enterprise JavaBeans 3.2 was a relatively minor release that mainly contained specification clarifications and lifted some restrictions that were imposed by the spec but over time appeared to serve no real purpose. A few existing full EJB features were also demanded to be in EJB 3 lite and functionality that was proposed to be pruned in EJB 3.1 was indeed pruned (made optional).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.oracle.com/arungupta/entry/what_s_new_in_ejb|title=What's new in EJB 3.2 ? - Java EE 7 chugging along! (Arun Gupta, Miles to go ...)|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.oracle.com/marina/entry/ejb_3_2_news|title=If you didn't know what is coming in EJB 3.2... (Marina Vatkina's Weblog)|accessdate=1 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202942/https://blogs.oracle.com/marina/entry/ejb_3_2_news|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following features were added:
* Passivation of a stateful session bean can be deactivated via attribute on @Stateful annotation (passivationCapable = false)
* TimerService can retrieve all active timers in the same EJB module (could previously only retrieve timers for the bean in which the TimerService was called)
* Lifecycle methods (e.g. @PostConstruct) can be transactional for stateful session beans using the existing @TransactionAttribute annotation
* Autocloseable interface implemented by embeddable container
'''EJB 3.1, final release (2009-12-10)'''

[http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=318 JSR 318]. The purpose of the Enterprise JavaBeans 3.1 specification is to further simplify the EJB architecture by reducing its complexity from the developer's point of view, while also adding new functionality in response to the needs of the community:
* Local view without interface (No-interface view)
* [[WAR file format (Sun)|.war]] packaging of EJB components
* EJB Lite: definition of a subset of EJB
* Portable EJB Global [[JNDI]] Names
* [[singleton pattern|Singleton]]s (Singleton Session Beans)
* Application Initialization and Shutdown Events
* EJB Timer Service Enhancements
* Simple [[wikt:asynchrony|Asynchrony]] (@Asynchronous for session beans)
'''EJB 3.0, final release (2006-05-11)'''

[http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220 JSR 220] - ''Major changes'':
This release made it much easier to write EJBs, using 'annotations' rather than the complex 'deployment descriptors' used in version 2.x. The use of home and remote interfaces and the ejb-jar.xml file were also no longer required in this release, having been replaced with a business interface and a bean that implements the interface.

'''EJB 2.1, final release (2003-11-24)'''

[http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=153 JSR 153] - ''Major changes'':
* [[Web service]] support (new): stateless session beans can be invoked over [[SOAP]]/[[HTTP]]. Also, an EJB can easily access a Web service using the new service reference.
* EJB timer service (new): Event-based mechanism for invoking EJBs at specific times.
* Message-driven beans accepts messages from sources other than [[Java Message Service|JMS]].
* Message destinations (the same idea as EJB references, resource references, etc.) has been added.
* EJB query language (EJB-QL) additions: ORDER BY, AVG, MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT, and MOD.
* [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML schema]] is used to specify deployment descriptors, replaces [[Document Type Definition|DTDs]]
'''EJB 2.0, final release (2001-08-22)'''

[http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=19 JSR 19] - ''Major changes'':
''Overall goals'':
* The standard component architecture for building ''distributed'' object-oriented business applications in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].
* Make it possible to build distributed applications by combining components developed using tools from ''different vendors''.
* Make it easy to write (enterprise) applications: Application developers will not have to understand low-level transaction and state management details, multi-threading, connection pooling, and other complex low-level APIs.
* Will follow the &quot;Write Once, Run Anywhere&quot; philosophy of [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. An enterprise Bean can be developed once, and then deployed on multiple platforms without recompilation or source code modification.
* Address the development, deployment, and runtime aspects of an enterprise application’s life cycle.
* Define the contracts that enable tools from multiple vendors to develop and deploy components that can interoperate at runtime.
* Be compatible with existing server platforms. Vendors will be able to extend their existing products to support EJBs.
* Be compatible with other [[Java (programming language)|Java]] APIs.
* Provide interoperability between enterprise Beans and Java EE components as well as non-Java programming language applications.
* Be compatible with the CORBA protocols (RMI-IIOP).
'''EJB 1.1, final release (1999-12-17)'''

''Major changes'':
* XML deployment descriptors
* Default JNDI contexts
* RMI over IIOP
* Security - role driven, not method driven
* Entity Bean support - mandatory, not optional

''Goals'' for Release 1.1:
* Provide better support for application assembly and deployment.
* Specify in greater detail the responsibilities of the individual EJB roles.
'''EJB 1.0 (1998-03-24)'''

Announced at [[JavaOne|JavaOne 1998]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alephnaught.com/WorkRelated/JavaOne1998/session6.html |title=JavaOne Conference Trip Report: Enterprise JavaBeans Technology: Developing and Deploying Business Applications as Components |publisher=Alephnaught.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun's third Java developers conference (March 24 through 27)
''Goals'' for Release 1.0:
* Defined the distinct &quot;EJB Roles&quot; that are assumed by the component architecture.
* Defined the client view of enterprise Beans.
* Defined the enterprise Bean developer’s view.
* Defined the responsibilities of an EJB Container provider and server provider; together these make up a system that supports the deployment and execution of enterprise Beans.

Straczynski is a graduate of [[San Diego State University|San Diego State University (SDSU)]], having earned a BA with a double major in psychology and sociology (with minors in [[philosophy]] and literature). While at SDSU, he wrote for the student newspaper, ''The Daily Aztec''  at times penning so many articles that the paper was jokingly referred to as the &quot;Daily Joe&quot;.

Straczynski met [[Kathryn M. Drennan]] while they were both at SDSU.

== Career ==

=== 1970s–1980s ===

==== Early work ====
Straczynski began writing plays, having several produced at [[Southwestern College (California)|Southwestern College]] and [[San Diego State University]] before publishing his adaptation of &quot;Snow White&quot; with Performance Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Straczynski |first=J. Michael |title=Snow White |publisher=Performance Publishing/Baker's Plays |year=1979 |isbn=0-87440-590-4 |pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other plays were produced around San Diego, including &quot;The Apprenticeship&quot; for the Marquis Public Theater. During the late 1970s, Straczynski also became the on-air entertainment reviewer for KSDO-FM and wrote several radio plays before being hired as a scriptwriter for the radio drama ''[[Alien Worlds (radio)|Alien Worlds]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlienWorlds&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.old-time.com/otrlogs2/aw_.log.txt |title=Alien Worlds Radio Show Index |date=2007-07-25 |publisher=Old-time.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040808065436/http://www.old-time.com/otrlogs2/aw_.log.txt |archive-date=August 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last= Plume|first= Kenneth|title= Interview with J.

He and [[Kathryn M. Drennan]], whom he met at San Diego State, moved to Los Angeles on April 1, 1981. They married in 1983 and separated in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/409615521248583680 Twitter/Facebook post]&lt;/ref&gt; He spent five years from 1987 to 1992 co-hosting the ''[[Hour 25]]'' radio [[talk show]] on KPFK-FM Los Angeles with [[Larry DiTillio]]. During his tenure, he interviewed such luminaries as [[John Carpenter]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Harlan Ellison]] and other writers, producers, actors and directors. In 2000, Straczynski returned to radio drama with  ''[[The City of Dreams]]'' for [[Syfy#Website|scifi.com]]. Straczynski is the author of three horror novels—''Demon Night'', ''Othersyde'', and ''Tribulations''—and nearly twenty short stories, many of which are collected in two compilations—''Tales from the New Twilight Zone'' and ''Straczynski Unplugged''.

==== Work in animation ====
Straczynski was a fan of the cartoon ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]''.  He wrote a [[spec script]] in 1984 and sent it directly to [[Filmation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035904p1.html |title=Interview with J. Michael Straczynski |date=2000-09-05 |publisher=ign.com |access-date=2011-01-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820034004/http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035904p1.html |archive-date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They purchased his script, bought several others, and hired him on staff.  During this time he became friends with [[Larry DiTillio]], and when Filmation produced the He-Man spinoff ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]'', they both worked as story editors on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-12077|title=Masters of the Universe|author=J. Michael Straczynski|access-date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.he-man.org/cartoon/pop/behindthescenes/shera-breakdowns.shtml|title=She-Ra Breakdowns|author=Filmation/J. Michael Straczynski|access-date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when Filmation refused to give them credit on-screen, both left, finding work with [[DIC Entertainment|DIC]] on ''[[Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors]]''.

Straczynski and DiTillio also worked to create an animated version of ''[[Elfquest]]'', but that project fell through when CBS attempted to retool the show to appeal to younger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfquest.com/edits/SeqTart1.html|title=Interview with Wendy and Richard Pini|access-date=2011-01-04|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720160448/http://www.elfquest.com/edits/SeqTart1.html|archive-date=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working on ''Jayce'', Straczynski was hired to come aboard the [[Len Janson]] and [[Chuck Menville]] project to adapt the movie ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' to an animated version called ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]''.  When Janson and Menville learned that there was not only a 13-episode order but a 65-episode syndication order as well, they decided that the workload was too much and that they would only work on their own scripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;GBDVD&quot;&gt;The Real Ghostbusters Complete Collection DVD interview with J. Michael Straczynski.&lt;/ref&gt;  DIC head [[Jean Chalopin]] asked Straczynski to take on the task of story editing the entire 78-episode block as well as writing his own scripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;GBDVD&quot; /&gt; After the show's successful first season, consultants were brought in to make suggestions for the show, including changing Janine to a more maternal character, giving every character a particular &quot;job&quot; (Peter is the funny one, Egon is the smart one, and Winston, the only black character, was to be the driver), and to add kids into the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;GBDVD&quot; /&gt;  Straczynski left at this point, Janson and Menville resuming the story editing job for the second network season.  Straczynski then began development on a show called ''[[Spiral Zone]]'' but left after only one script, taking his name off the series, because management drastically altered his conception of show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated/msg/2c7ed07ec5ce509d|title=new jms tv series|author=Straczynski, J. Michael|access-date=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; substituting the pseudonym &quot;Fettes Grey&quot; (derived from the names of the grave robbers in ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]'')

Straczynski also wrote for ''[[CBS Storybreak]]'', writing an adaptation of [[Evelyn Sibley Lampman]]'s ''The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek''.

==== Live action and network shows ====
After leaving animation, Straczynski freelanced for ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' writing an episode entitled (&quot;What Are Friends For&quot;) and, for [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''[[Nightmare Classics]]'', adaptating ''[[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', which was nominated for a [[Writers Guild of America|Writer's Guild]] Award.

Straczynski was then offered the position of story editor on the syndicated live-action science fiction series ''[[Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future]]''.  Straczynski constructed a season long arc with lasting character changes and wrote a third of the scripts himself.  After one season, the toy company [[Mattel]] demanded more input into the show, causing Straczynski to quit.  He recommended DiTillio to take over the job as story editor for a second season, but the toy company financing fell through and that season was never produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-14848|title=B5 – Capt Power|date=1994-11-09|author=Straczynski, J. Michael|access-date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]] began. Straczynski met [[Harlan Ellison]] during this time and later became friends with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-12638|title=How'd You Meet Harlan|date=1995-03-23|author=Straczynski, J. Michael|access-date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-10766|title=The Harlan Award|date=1998-06-20|author=Straczynski, J. Michael|access-date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the strike ended, the producers of the new ''Twilight Zone'' needed to create more episodes to be able to sell the series into syndication with a complete 65-episode package.  They hired Straczynski as executive story editor to fill in the remaining number of needed episodes. Straczynski wrote many of the scripts himself. In addition, one episode, &quot;Crazy as a Soup Sandwich&quot;, was written by Ellison.

After leaving ''Twilight Zone'', his agent of the time asked him to pitch for the show ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The (Even More!) Complete Book of Scriptwriting|last=Straczynski|first=J. Michael|publisher=Writer's Digest|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially wary, Straczynski finally did and was hired on as story editor under [[Jeri Taylor]] and [[David Moessinger]].  When Taylor and Moessinger left the show, Straczynski left too as an act of solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-13203|title=Looking for Captain Power|date=1995-07-13|author=Straczynski, J. Michael|access-date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Moessinger was hired as executive producer for ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', he offered Straczynski a job as co-producer. Straczynski joined ''Murder'' for two seasons and wrote seven produced episodes.  Moessinger and Straczynski moved the protagonist, Jessica Fletcher, from the sleepy Maine town of [[Cabot Cove]] to New York City to revitalize the show.  The move effectively brought the show back into the top ten from the mid-thirties where it had fallen.  Straczynski made Jessica an instructor in writing and criminology, and he emphasized her role as a working writer, with all the deadlines and problems involved in that profession.

Straczynski also wrote one episode of ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' for Moessinger between the pilot episode for ''Babylon 5'' and the start of its first season.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMS_1996_0305&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.net/msg.aspx?id=1-15629|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004142308/http://www.jmsnews.net/msg.aspx?id=1-15629|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-10-04|title=click... *click*... CLIC|date=1996-03-05|publisher=JMSNews, originally published on [[AOL]]|author=Straczynski, J. Michael|access-date=2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straczynski  wrote an adaptation of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' for the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] network, which was nominated for a Writer's Guild of America award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265408/awards|title=Awards for &quot;Nightmare Classics&quot; (1989)|publisher=IMDB: The Internet Movie Database|access-date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' movie, ''[[Murder, She Wrote: A Story to Die For]],'' which he produced.

=== 1990s ===

==== ''Babylon 5'' and ''Crusade'' ====
In late 1991, [[Warner Bros.]] contracted with Straczynski and [[Douglas Netter|Doug Netter]] as partners to produce ''Babylon 5'' as the flagship program for the new [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-7689|title=Official Announcement|date=1991-11-20|author=Straczynski, J. Michael|access-date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straczynski and Netter hired many of the people from ''Captain Power'', as well as hiring Ellison as a consultant and DiTillio as a story editor.  ''Babylon 5'' won two [[Emmy Award]]s, back-to-back [[Hugo Award]]s, and dozens of other awards. Straczynski wrote 92 of the 110 [[List of Babylon 5 episodes|episodes]], as well as the pilot and five television movies.  The show is a character-driven [[space opera]] and features an intentional emphasis on realism in its portrayal of space operations. It also pioneered extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for its [[special effect]]s.  ''Babylon 5'' was produced and broadcast for five seasons completing Stracynski's planned story arc. Its sequel, ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'', was produced for the TNT Network, however it ended with only 13 episodes. Production was halted before the first episode aired.

He wrote the outlines for nine of the [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] ''Babylon 5'' novels, supervised the three produced ''B5'' telefilm novelizations (''In the Beginning'', ''Thirdspace'', and ''A Call to Arms''), and is the author of four ''Babylon 5'' short stories published in magazines, not yet reprinted ({{as of|2008|lc=on}}).

In 2005, Straczynski began publishing his ''Babylon 5'' scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-17414|title=Babylon 5 Scripts Site Nearly Ready, And More!|date=2005-05-21|publisher=JMSNews|author=Straczynski, J. Michael|access-date=2006-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process ended in June 2008, with the scripts no longer being available from the end of July of that year. His scripts for the television movies were published for a limited time in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campaign.constantcontact.com/render?v=001LDAvtWmYthUfV42TzOKX4NtaLlyfj3eaRajSDGes6vnakAlTLHwOuZ0Lzb9OsxQ5xS3HWuHtHO7_jx-iOT8WrKt0rOcH2zlfz4VNNKbuREs%3D.|title=Babylon 5 Music Videos Just Released|date=2008-12-23|publisher=Babylon 5 Scripts|author=The Babylon 5 Scripts Team|access-date=2008-12-27}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straczynski also wrote and produced the pilot ''[[Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers]]'', a pilot for the SciFi Network, and wrote, directed and produced ''[[Babylon 5: The Lost Tales]]'' as a two-hour direct-to-DVD movie.

==== Joe's Comics ====
Straczynski has long been a comic fan and began writing comics in the late 1980s. His work in comics includes the adaptations of ''[[Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Star Trek (DC Comics)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Babylon 5 Novels, novelizations, short stories, and comic books|Babylon 5]]''. In 1999 he created ''[[Rising Stars (comics)|Rising Stars]]'' for [[Top Cow]]/[[Image Comics]]. Eventually he worked mostly under his own imprint – [[Joe's Comics]] – for which he wrote the ''[[Midnight Nation]]'' miniseries and the illustrated fantasy parable ''[[Delicate Creatures]]''.

=== 2000s ===

==== Marvel Comics ====
[[Marvel Comics]] then signed him to an exclusive contract, beginning with a run on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', from 2001–2007. He took over the series with Volume 2 issue #30 ([[cover date]]d June 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|last=Manning|first=Matthew K.|editor-last=Gilbert|editor-first=Laura|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2008|location= London|isbn=978-0756641238|page=305|chapter=2000s|quote=TV creator J.

Michael Straczynski decided to tackle another of Marvel's iconic pantheon – Thor.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and mini-series featuring the Silver Surfer and a &quot;What If&quot; scenario, ''[[Bullet Points (comics)|Bullet Points]]''.

==== ''Jeremiah'' ====
Straczynski also ran ''[[Jeremiah (TV series)|Jeremiah]]'', loosely based on the Belgian [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] comic [[Jeremiah (comics)|of the same name]], from 2002&amp;ndash;2004.  Straczynski ran the series for two seasons but was frustrated with the conflicting directions that [[MGM]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] wanted from the show,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.net/msg.aspx?id=1-17559|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004142329/http://www.jmsnews.net/msg.aspx?id=1-17559|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-10-04|title=Aeon Flux Commentary|date=2006-06-13|author=Straczynski, J. Michael|access-date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even used the pseudonym &quot;Fettes Grey&quot; for the first time since ''Spiral Zone'' on one of the scripts.  In the second season, Straczynski decided to leave the show if things did not improve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.net/msg.aspx?id=1-17197|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004142423/http://www.jmsnews.net/msg.aspx?id=1-17197|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-10-04|title=When Did You Know|date=2004-09-26|author=Straczynski, J. Michael|access-date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the show ended after two seasons.

==== ''Changeling'' ====
Straczynski wrote ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'', a psychological drama film based partly on the [[Wineville Chicken Coop Murders|&quot;Wineville Chicken Coop&quot; kidnapping and murder case]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], produced by [[Ron Howard]], and starring [[Angelina Jolie]], the film premiered in 2008 and subsequently received eight nominations for the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]], including a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.&lt;ref name=&quot;bafta 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/film-nominations-in-2009,657,BA.html |title=BAFTA listing of 2009 award nominees &amp; winners |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014605/http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/2009,2378,BA.html |archive-date=2012-02-03 |url-status=dead |access-date=2010-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first draft script was written in eleven days, after Straczynski figured out &quot;how to tell&quot; the story,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/video/2007/08/08/Busy-writer-is-drawn-back-to-23rd-century/stories/200708080260|title=Busy writer is drawn back to 23rd century|last=Eberson|first=Sharon|date=August 8, 2007|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ended up being the shooting draft, after Eastwood declined to make any changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/united-changeling-123327|title=United for 'Changeling'|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was optioned immediately by Howard, who at first intended to direct the film but later stepped down after scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Frémont]], whose writings helped lure pioneers to the area. Downtown Las Vegas's Fremont Street is named after him.

Eleven years later, members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] chose Las Vegas as the site to build a fort halfway between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, where they would travel to gather supplies. The fort was abandoned several years afterward. The remainder of this [[Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park|Old Mormon Fort]] can still be seen at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue.

Las Vegas was founded as a city in 1905, when {{convert|110|acre}} of land adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad tracks were auctioned in what would become the downtown area. In 1911, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://dwgateway.library.unr.edu/keck/histtopoNV/Origin_of_Place_Names_Files/1941NevadaOriginofNames-pt1.pdf | title=Origin of Place Names: Nevada | publisher=W.P.A. | author=Federal Writers' Project | year=1941 | page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1931 was a pivotal year for Las Vegas. At that time, Nevada legalized casino gambling and reduced residency requirements for divorce to six weeks. This year also witnessed the beginning of construction on nearby [[Hoover Dam]]. The influx of construction workers and their families helped Las Vegas avoid economic calamity during the Great Depression. The construction work was completed in 1935.

In late 1941, [[Nellis Air Force Base#History|Las Vegas Army Airfield]] was established. Renamed [[Nellis Air Force Base]] in 1950, it is now home to the [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds]] aerobatic team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afthunderbirds.com/site/|accessdate=25 October 2019|title=United States Air Force Thunderbirds|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020032655/http://afthunderbirds.com/site/|archive-date=October 20, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II, lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos, and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas.

In 1951, [[nuclear weapons testing]] began at the [[Nevada Test Site]], {{convert|65|mi}} northwest of Las Vegas. During this time, the city was nicknamed the [[History of Las Vegas#Atomic testing|&quot;Atomic City&quot;]]. Residents and visitors were able to witness the mushroom clouds (and were exposed to the fallout) until 1963, when the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] required that nuclear tests be moved underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/include/popup_fullImage.aspx?key=xi6i6nJGw4+EAIUukn0VVqyE9lgKboA6 |title=Cesium 137 deposition density resulting from the cumulative effect of the Nevada tests |last1=Simon |first1=Steven |last2=Bouville |first2=Andre |date=2006 |website=American Scientist |publisher=American Scientist.org |access-date=March 27, 2016 |quote=&quot;Deposition...generally decreases with distance from the test site in the direction of the prevailing wind across North America, although isolated locations received significant deposition as a result of rainfall.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/include/popup_fullImage.aspx?key=xi6i6nJGw48vKULXvfEIZOOm8IOPKgCE |title=Wind shear (variations in wind speed and direction with altitude) causes fallout to spread over large areas. |last1=Simon |first1=Steven |last2=Bouville |first2=Andre |date=2006 |website=American Scientist |publisher=American Scientist.org |access-date=March 27, 2016 |quote=&quot;Trajectories of the fallout debris clouds across the U.S. are shown for four altitudes.

In 1955, the [[Moulin Rouge Hotel]] opened and became the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas.

The iconic &quot;[[Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign|Welcome to Las Vegas]]&quot; sign, which has never been located within municipal limits, was created in 1959 by [[Betty Willis (artist)|Betty Willis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/13/garden/13VEGA.html|title=A Neon Come-Hither, Still Able to Flirt|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Las vegas late 60s.png|thumb|left|[[Fremont Street]] in the late 1960s]]
During the 1960s, corporations and business tycoons such as Howard Hughes were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as &quot;gaming&quot;, which transitioned it into a legitimate business.

The year 1995 marked the opening of the [[Fremont Street Experience]], in Las Vegas's downtown area. This canopied five-block area features 12.5&amp;nbsp;million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight during shows held at the top of each hour.

Due to the realization of many revitalization efforts, 2012 was dubbed &quot;The Year of Downtown.&quot; Projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars made their debut at this time, including the [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]], the [[Discovery Children's Museum|DISCOVERY Children's Museum]], the [[Mob Museum]], the [[Neon Museum]], a [[Las Vegas City Hall|new City Hall]] complex, and renovations for a new [[Zappos|Zappos.com]] corporate headquarters in the [[Las Vegas City Hall (1973)|old City Hall]] building.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downtown Las Vegas Visitors Guide, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2017, the deadliest [[mass shooting]] in U.S. history occurred in Downtown Las Vegas, when [[Stephen Paddock]] knocked out the window of his hotel room at [[Mandalay Bay]] before [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|shooting at the crowds]] of the [[Route 91 Harvest]] [[music festival]] across the street with multiple firearms, killing 60 people and injuring 411 others before he committed [[suicide]]. Paddock's use of [[bump stock]]s in the massacre led to them being [[Bump stock#Federal|banned]] by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in March 2018; the ban came into effect the following year.

Much of the landscape is rocky and arid, with desert vegetation and wildlife. It can be subjected to torrential flash floods, although much has been done to mitigate the effects of flash floods through improved drainage systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/water-environment/flood-control-success|title=Flood control a success – Las Vegas Review-Journal|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peaks surrounding Las Vegas reach elevations of over {{convert|10000|ft}}, and act as barriers to the strong flow of moisture from the surrounding area. The elevation is approximately {{convert|2030|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|135.86|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|135.81|sqmi|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|0.05|sqmi|abbr=on}} (0.03%) is water.

After Alaska and California, Nevada is the third most seismically active state in the U.S. It has been estimated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that over the next 50 years, there is a 10–20% chance of a M6.0 or greater earthquake occurring within {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} of Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://data.nbmg.unr.edu/Public/freedownloads/misc/Presentations/earthquakes/lossestimationmodeling23feb06.pdf|title=Loss-Estimation Modeling of Earthquake Scenarios for Each County in Nevada Using HAZUS-MH |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= February 23, 2006 |website=Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology |publisher=Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology/University of Nevada, Reno |access-date=March 27, 2016 |quote=&quot;Probability of an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or greater occurring within 50 km in 50 years (from USGS probabilistic seismic hazard analysis) 10–20% chance for Las Vegas area, magnitude 6&quot; (p.65)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the city, there are many lawns, trees and other greenery. Due to water resource issues, there has been a movement to encourage [[xeriscaping|xeriscapes]]. Another part of conservation efforts is scheduled watering days for residential landscaping. A [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] grant in 2008 funded a program that analyzed and forecast growth and environmental impacts through the year 2019.

Las Vegas has a [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BWh''), typical of the [[Mojave Desert]] in which it lies. This climate is typified by long, extremely hot summers; warm transitional seasons; and short winters with mild days and cool nights. There is abundant sunshine throughout the year, with an average of 310 sunny days and bright sunshine during 86% of all daylight hours.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOWData NWS Las Vegas, NV (VEF) - LASthr&quot;/&gt; Rainfall is scarce, with an average of {{convert|4.2|in|abbr=on}} dispersed between roughly 26 to 27 total rainy days per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDC txt KLAS&quot;/&gt; Las Vegas is among the sunniest, driest, and least humid locations in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/low-humidity-cities.php |title = Cities With Low Humidity in the USA |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with exceptionally low dew points and humidity that sometimes remain below 10%.

The summer months of June through September are extremely hot, though moderated by extremely low humidity. July is the hottest month, with an average daytime high of {{convert|104.2|°F|1}}. On average, 134 days per year reach or exceed {{convert|90|°F}}, of which 74 days reach {{convert|100|°F|0}} and 7 days reach {{convert|110|°F|0}}. During the peak intensity of summer, overnight lows frequently remain above {{convert|80|°F|0}}, and occasionally above {{convert|85|°F|0}}.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOWData NWS Las Vegas, NV (VEF) - LASthr&quot;/&gt; While most summer days are consistently hot, dry, and cloudless, the [[North American Monsoon]] sporadically interrupts this pattern and brings more cloud cover, thunderstorms, lightning, increased humidity, and brief spells of heavy rain. The window of opportunity for the monsoon to affect Las Vegas usually falls between July and August, although this is inconsistent and varies considerably in its impact from year to year. Summer in Las Vegas is marked by a significant [[diurnal variation]]; while less extreme than other parts of the state, nighttime lows in Las Vegas are often {{convert|30|F-change|1}} or more lower than daytime highs.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarworks.unr.edu/bitstream/handle/11714/2409/Sauceda_unr_0139M_11689.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y&lt;/ref&gt;

Las Vegas winters are short and generally very mild, with chilly (but rarely cold) daytime temperatures. Like all seasons, sunshine is abundant. December is both the year's coolest and cloudiest month, with an average daytime high of {{convert|56.6|°F|1}} and sunshine occurring during 78% of its daylight hours. Winter evenings are defined by clear skies and swift drops in temperature after sunset, with overnight minima averaging around {{convert|39|°F|1}} in December and January. Owing to its elevation that ranges from 2,000 feet to 3,000 feet, Las Vegas experiences markedly cooler winters than other areas of the [[Mojave Desert]] and the adjacent [[Sonoran Desert]] that are closer to sea level. Consequently, the city records freezing temperatures an average of 16 nights per winter. However, it is exceptionally rare for temperatures to reach or fall below {{convert|25|°F|0}}, or for temperatures to remain below {{convert|45|°F|0}} for an entire day.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOWData NWS Las Vegas, NV (VEF) - LASthr&quot;/&gt; Most of the annual precipitation falls during the winter months, but even February, the wettest month, averages only four days of measurable rain. The mountains immediately surrounding the Las Vegas Valley accumulate snow every winter, but significant accumulation within the city is rare, although moderate accumulations do occur every few years. The most recent accumulations occurred on February 18, 2019 when parts of the city received about {{convert|1 to 2|in|cm|1}} of snow&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-snow-20190218-story.html|title=It just snowed in Vegas and likely will again this week.

According to research by demographer [[William H. Frey]], using data from the [[2010 United States Census]], Las Vegas has the second lowest level of black-white segregation of any of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, after [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frey |first1=William H. |title=Diversity Explosion: How New Racial Demographics Are Remaking America |date=2018 |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-8157-2398-1 |page=177|edition=Second }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaiians and Las Vegans alike sometimes refer to Las Vegas as the &quot;ninth island of [[Hawaii]]&quot; because so many Hawaiians have moved to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateofthereunion.com/home/season-2-2/las-vegas-nv |title=Las Vegas: Bright Lights, Big City, Small Town |publisher=State of the Reunion |accessdate=July 5, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602145540/http://stateofthereunion.com/home/season-2-2/las-vegas-nv |archive-date=June 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the census&lt;ref name=&quot;GR2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 31, 2008|title=U.S. Census website}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2010, there were 583,756 people, 211,689 households, and 117,538 families residing in the city. The population density was {{convert|4222.5|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. There were 190,724 housing units at an average density of {{convert|1683.3|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.

As of 2006, there were 176,750 households, out of which 31.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.3% were married couples living together, 12.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.5% were non-families. 25.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.20.

In the city, the population age distribution was as follows:

* 25.9% under the age of 18
* 8.8% from 18 to 24
* 32.0% from 25 to 44
* 21.7% from 45 to 64

The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 103.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.5 males.

The [[Median household income|median income]] for a household in the city was $53,000 and the median income for a family was $58,465.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US3240000&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_S1901&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_ |title=Census |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=July 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212054817/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US3240000&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_S1901&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_ |archive-date=February 12, 2020 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Males had a median income of $35,511 versus $27,554 for females. The per capita income for the city was $22,060. About 6.6% of families and 8.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.4% of those under age 18 and 6.3% of those age 65 or over.

According to a 2004 study, Las Vegas has one of the highest divorce rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/features/us_stresscities.html |title=Most Stressful US City |publisher=City Mayors |date=January 10, 2004 |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blakeslee |first=Sandra |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE5DB153FF935A25751C1A961958260 |title=Health: Suicide Rate Higher in 3 Gambling Cities, Study Says |work=New York Times |date=December 16, 1997 |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's high divorce rate is not wholly due to Las Vegans themselves getting divorced. Since divorce is easier in Nevada than most other states, many people come from across the country for the easier process. Similarly, Nevada marriages are notoriously easy to get. Las Vegas has one of the highest marriage rates of U.S. cities, with many licenses issued to people from outside the area (see [[Las Vegas weddings]]).

==Economy==
The primary drivers of the Las Vegas economy are tourism, [[Downtown (Nevada gaming area)|gaming]] and conventions, which in turn feed the retail and restaurant industries.

The major attractions in Las Vegas are the casinos and the hotels, although in recent years other new attractions have begun to emerge.

Most casinos in the downtown area are located on [[Fremont Street]], with [[Stratosphere Las Vegas|The Stratosphere]] being one of the exceptions. [[Fremont East]], adjacent to the Fremont Street Experience, was granted variances to allow bars to be closer together, similar to the [[Gaslamp Quarter]] of San Diego, the goal being to attract a different demographic than the Strip attracts.

====Downtown casinos====
{{Main|Downtown (Nevada gaming area)}}
The [[Golden Gate Hotel and Casino]], located downtown along the Fremont Street Experience, is the oldest continuously operating hotel and casino in Las Vegas; it opened in 1906 as the Hotel Nevada.

The year 1931 marked the opening of the [[Northern Club (casino)|Northern Club]] (now the [[La Bayou]]).&lt;ref name=lvrj20000727&gt;{{cite news |first=Heidi Knapp |last=Rinella |title=New book raises questions about Silver State |work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |date=July 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.a2zlasvegas.com/fse/fse01.html |title= Fremont Street Experience Brings Downtown Las Vegas into Next Century |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |publisher=[[Fremont Street Experience]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of the early casinos may have been [[Binion's Horseshoe]] (now [[Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel]]) while it was run by [[Benny Binion]].

[[Boyd Gaming]] has a major presence downtown operating the [[California Hotel &amp; Casino]], the [[Fremont Hotel &amp; Casino]] and the [[Main Street Casino]]. The [[Four Queens]] also operates downtown along the Fremont Street Experience.

Downtown casinos that have undergone major renovations and revitalization in recent years include the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas]], [[The D Las Vegas]] (formerly Fitzgerald's), the [[Downtown Grand|Downtown Grand Las Vegas]] (formerly Lady Luck), the [[El Cortez (Las Vegas)|El Cortez Hotel &amp; Casino]] and the [[Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino]].&lt;ref&gt;2013 Fiscal Year in Review, city of Las Vegas Economic and Urban Development Projects, &quot;A New Downtown Emerges.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Las Vegas Strip====
&lt;!--The Las Vegas Strip is not actually located in city limits. Please keep this section short--&gt;
{{main|Las Vegas Strip}}
The center of the gambling and entertainment industry is located on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], outside the city limits in the surrounding unincorporated communities of [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] and [[Winchester, Nevada|Winchester]] in Clark County. The largest and most notable casinos and buildings are located there.&lt;ref name=&quot;LVS 2008-05-15&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/may/15/evolution-worlds-entertainment-capital/|title=Showtime: How Sin City evolved into 'The Entertainment Capital of the World'|last1=Koch|first1=Ed|last2=Manning|first2=Mary|date=May 15, 2008|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|access-date=3 March 2019|last3=Toplikar|first3=Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

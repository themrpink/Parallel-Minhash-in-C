Francis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. The repudiation of the Treaty of Madrid led to the [[War of the League of Cognac]] of 1526–30. By the mid-1520s, [[Pope Clement VII]] wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so to that end he negotiated with Venice to form the [[League of Cognac]]. Francis I willingly joined this anti-Imperial league in May 1526.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mallett,and Christine Shaw, ''The Italian Wars: 1494–1559'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the league of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse]] on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the [[Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Wurttemberg]] to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and renewed the contest in Italy in the [[Italian War of 1536–1538]] after the death of [[Francesco II Sforza]], the ruler of Milan. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the [[Truce of Nice]]. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis' final attempt on Italy in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Crépy]] because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the [[Schmalkaldic League]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, ''Emperor'' (2019) pp 308–312.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with the New World and Asia===
[[File:Viaggioverrazzano.jpg|thumb|The voyage of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524]]

Francis had been much aggrieved at the [[papal bull]] [[Aeterni regis]]: in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, [[Portugal]] and the [[Crown of Castile|Crown of Castille]] signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, &quot;The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam’s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canada Quebec 1534–2000|last=Lacoursière|first=Jacques|publisher=Septentrion|year=2005|isbn=978-2894481868|location=Québec|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to counterbalance the power of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the [[New World]] through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance.

The port city now known as [[Le Havre]] was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of [[Honfleur]] and [[Harfleur]], whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named ''Franciscopolis'' after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns.

====Americas====
{{further|France-Americas relations}}
In 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of [[Lyon]] in financing the expedition of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of [[New York City]], naming it [[New Angoulême]], and claimed [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] for the French crown. Verrazzano's letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the ''[[Cèllere Codex]]''.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Destombes|first1=M.|date=1954|title=Nautical Charts Attributed to Verrazano (1525–1528)|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=11|pages=57–66|oclc=1752690|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/03085695408592059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1531, [[Bertrand d'Ornesan]] tried to establish a French trading post at [[Pernambuco]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, R.J. ''Francis I'', (Cambridge University Press, 1982), 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1534, Francis sent [[Jacques Cartier]] to explore the [[St. Lawrence River]] in [[Quebec]] to find &quot;certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, R.J. ''Francis I'', 333.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1541, Francis sent [[Jean-François Roberval|Jean-François de Roberval]] to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of &quot;the Holy Catholic faith.&quot;

====Far East Asia====
{{further|France-Asia relations}}
[[File:Australia first map.jpg|thumb|An example of the [[Dieppe maps]] showing [[Sumatra]]. [[Nicholas Vallard]], 1547.]]

French trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner [[Jean Ango]]. In July 1527, a French [[Normandy|Norman]] trading ship from the city of [[Rouen]] is recorded by the Portuguese [[João de Barros]] as having arrived in the Indian city of [[Diu, India|Diu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-08AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 |title=The English history of the British Empire'' p. 61 |accessdate=2012-08-23|year=1940 |last1=Benians |first1=Ernest Alfred |last2=Newton |first2=Arthur Percival |last3=Rose |first3=John Holland }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1529, [[Jean Parmentier (explorer)|Jean Parmentier]], on board the ''Sacre'' and the ''Pensée'', reached [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlibHoeruDUC&amp;pg=PA123 |title=''European travellers in India'' p. 123 |accessdate=2012-08-23|isbn=9788120607101 |last1=Oaten |first1=Edward Farley |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the [[Dieppe maps]], influencing the work of [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] cartographers such as [[Jean Rotz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7OuMkzGKw0C&amp;pg=PA57 |title=''Explorers and colonies: America, 1500–1625'', p. 57 |date= 1990-01-01|accessdate=2012-08-23|isbn=9781852850241 |last1=Quinn |first1=David B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ottoman Empire====
{{further|Franco-Ottoman alliance|Orientalism in early modern France}}

Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the [[Arabic language]] under the guidance of [[Guillaume Postel]] at the [[Collège de France]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sl8fniRER4kC&amp;pg=PA26 ''Eastern wisdom and learning: the study of Arabic in seventeenth-century ...'' by [[G. J. Toomer]] p.26-7]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francois I Suleiman.jpg|thumb|left|Francis I (left) and [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (right) initiated a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]].  Both were separately painted by [[Titian]] circa 1530.]]

In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]]. The alliance has been called &quot;the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5iJ1tfLnnoC&amp;q=%22Franco-Turkish+alliance%22&amp;pg=PA62 |title=Kann, p. 62 |date=1980-11-26 |accessdate=2012-08-23|isbn=9780520042063 |last1=Kann |first1=Robert A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller, p.2&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and was designated &quot;the impious alliance&quot;, or &quot;the sacrilegious union of the [French]&amp;nbsp;[[Fleur-de-Lis|Lily]] and the [Ottoman]&amp;nbsp;[[Crescent]].&quot; Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AkMHta3C7LUC&amp;q=%22Franco-Turkish+alliance%22&amp;pg=PA219 |title=Merriman, p. 133 |date= March 2007|accessdate=2012-08-23|isbn=9781406772722 |last1=Merriman |first1=Roger Bigelow }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the [[Siege of Nice]].

In 1533, Francis I sent colonel [[Pierre de Piton]] as ambassador to [[Morocco]], initiating official [[France-Morocco relations]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Francois I, hoping that Morocco would open up to France as easily as Mexico had to Spain, sent a commission, half commercial and half diplomatic, which he confided to one Pierre de Piton. The story of his mission is not without interest&quot; in ''The conquest of Morocco'' by Cecil Vivian Usborne, S. Paul &amp; co. ltd., 1936, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the [[Wattassid]] ruler of [[Fes|Fez]], [[Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Muhammad|Ahmed ben Mohammed]], welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders.

===Bureaucratic reform and language policy===
[[File:Ordonnance de Villers Cotterets August 1539.jpg|thumb|The [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]] in August 1539 prescribed the use of French in official documents.]]

Francis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of [[Latin]] as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Collège des trois langues, or [[Collège de France|Collège Royal]], following the recommendation of humanist [[Guillaume Budé]]. Students at the Collège could study [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]], then [[Arabic]] under [[Guillaume Postel]] beginning in 1539.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Ina Baghdianitz. ''Orientalism in early modern France''. {{ISBN|978-1-84520-374-0}}, p. 25 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1539, in his castle in [[Villers-Cotterêts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nuyx5E_wp7QC&amp;pg=PA158 |title=The rise and fall of Renaissance France, 1483–1610, p. 158 |date= 21 January 2002|accessdate=2012-08-23|isbn=9780631227298 |last1=Knecht |first1=Robert J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis signed the important edict known as [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]], which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for [[Latin language|Latin]]. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.

===Religious policies===
Divisions in [[Christianity]] in Western Europe during Francis' reign created lasting international rifts. [[Martin Luther]]'s preaching and writing sparked the [[Protestant Reformation]], which spread through much of Europe, including France.

[[File:Massacre of the Vaudois of Merindol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mérindol massacre|Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545]]

Initially, Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, under the influence of his beloved sister [[Marguerite de Navarre]], who was genuinely attracted by Luther's theology. He even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. In 1533 Francis even dared to suggest to Pope Clement VII that he convene a church council in which Catholic and Protestant rulers would have an equal vote in order to settle their differences – an offer rejected by both the Pope and Charles V. Beginning in 1523, however, Francis burned several heretics at the [[Place Maubert]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Goubert]], ''The Course of French History'' Psychology Press, 1991, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis' attitude towards [[Protestantism]] changed for the worse following the &quot;[[Affair of the Placards]]&quot;, on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic [[Mass (Catholicism)|mass]]. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice's allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as [[Etienne Dolet]] tortured and burned.&lt;ref&gt;Goubert, op. cit., p.92&lt;/ref&gt; [[Printing]] was censored and leading [[Protestant reformers]] such as [[John Calvin]] were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Knecht, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rvEBMIIcHQkC&amp;pg=PA405 ''Francis I']'' pp.405–406&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecutions against Protestants were codified in the [[Edict of Fontainebleau (1540)]] issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the [[Waldensians]], at the [[Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545.

===Death===
Francis died at the [[Château de Rambouillet]] on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor's 28th birthday. It is said that &quot;he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavendish|first1=Richard|title=The Marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots {{!}} History Today|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/marriage-mary-queen-scots|website=www.historytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in [[Saint Denis Basilica]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]].

Francis' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the [[Reign of Terror]] at the height of the [[French Revolution]].

===Image and reputation===
[[File:Grand culverin of Francis I 140mm 307cm Algiers recovered in 1830.jpg|thumb|[[Calibres de France|Grand culverin]] of Francis I, with his emblem and motto. A gift to his Ottoman allies recovered in [[Algiers]] in 1830. [[Musée de l'Armée]].]]

Francis I has a poor reputation in France—his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian [[Jules Michelet]] set the negative image.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Knecht, &quot;'Born between two women...'Jules Michelet and Francis I.&quot; ''Renaissance Studies'' (2000) 14#3: 329-343 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24412871 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis' personal emblem was the [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]] and his Latin motto was ''Nutrisco et extinguo'' (&quot;I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His long nose earned him the nickname ''François du Grand Nez'' (&quot;Francis of the Big Nose&quot;), he was also colloquially known as the &quot;Grand Colas&quot; or &quot;Bonhomme Colas&quot;. For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as ''le Roi-Chevalier'' (&quot;the Knight-King&quot;) or the ''le Roi-Guerrier'' (&quot;the Warrior-King&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]] [https://archive.is/20130213110523/http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/article/Laroussefr_-_Article/11020086]&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success:
:He was a king who ruled as well as reigned. He knew the importance of war and a high international profile in staking his claim to be a great warrior-king of France. In battle he was brave, if impetuous, which led equally to triumph and disaster. Domestically, Francis exercised the spirit and letter of the royal prerogative to its fullest extent. He bargained hard over taxation and other issues with interest groups, often by appearing not to bargain at all. He enhanced royal power and concentrated decision-making in a tight personal executive but used a wide range of offices, gifts and his own personal charisma to build up an elective personal affinity among the ranks of the nobility upon whom his reign depended&amp;nbsp;.... Under Francis, the court of France was at the height of its prestige and international influence during the 16th century. Although opinion has varied considerably over the centuries since his death, his cultural legacy to France, to its Renaissance, was immense and ought to secure his reputation as among the greatest of its kings.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 2015, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and issue==
On 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin [[Claude of France|Claude]], the daughter of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII of France]] and [[Anne of Brittany|Duchess Anne of Brittany]]. The couple had seven children:
* Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1517): died young; engaged to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] almost from birth until death.
* [[Charlotte of Valois|Charlotte]] (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524): died young; engaged to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] from 1518 until death.
* [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]] (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536), who succeeded his mother Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died aged 18, unmarried and childless.
* [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559). Succeeded Francis I as King of France. Married [[Catherine de' Medici]], had issue.
* [[Madeleine of France (1520-1537)|Madeleine]] (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537), who married [[James V of Scotland]] and had no issue.
* [[Charles de Valois, Duc d'Orléans|Charles]] (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545), who died unmarried and childless.
* [[Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry|Margaret]] (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574), who married [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]], in 1559 and had issue.

On 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife [[Eleanor of Austria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

a sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was [[Françoise de Foix]], Countess of [[Châteaubriant]]. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured [[Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly]], Duchess of Étampes who, with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly [[Mary Boleyn]], mistress of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and sister of Henry's future wife, [[Anne Boleyn]].&lt;ref&gt;Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, X, no.450&lt;/ref&gt;

==Francis I in films, stage and literature==
The amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by [[Fanny Kemble]], ''Francis the First'', and the 1832 play by [[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Le Roi s'amuse]]'' (&quot;The King's Amusement&quot;), which featured the jester [[Triboulet]], the inspiration for the 1851 opera ''[[Rigoletto (opera)|Rigoletto]]'' by [[Giuseppe Verdi]].

Francis was first played in a [[George Méliès]] movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), [[Aimé Simon-Girard]] (1937), [[Sacha Guitry]] (1937), [[Gérard Oury]] (1953), [[Jean Marais]] (1955), [[Pedro Armendáriz]] (1956), [[Claude Titre]] (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). [[Timothy West]] (1998) and [[Emmanuel Leconte]] (2007– 2010).

Francis was portrayed by [[Peter Gilmore]] in the comedy film ''[[Carry On Henry]]'' charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis).

Francis receives a mention in a minor story in [[Laurence Sterne]]'s novel ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''. The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war.

He is also mentioned in Jean de la Brète's novel ''Reine – Mon oncle et mon curé'', where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest.

He often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters – [[Mary Boleyn]] (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen [[Anne Boleyn]] (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels ''The Lady in the Tower'', ''[[The Other Boleyn Girl]],'' ''The Last Boleyn'', ''Dear Heart, How Like You This?'' and ''Mademoiselle Boleyn'' feature Francis in their story. He appears in [[Hilary Mantel]]'s ''Wolf Hall'' about Henry VIII's minister [[Thomas Cromwell]] and is often referred to in its sequel, ''Bring Up the Bodies''.

Francis is portrayed in Diane Haeger's novel ''Courtesan'' about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II.

Francis appears as the patron of [[Benvenuto Cellini]] in the 1843 French novel ''L'Orfèvre du roi, ou Ascanio'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]].

[[Samuel Shellabarger]]'s novel ''The King's Cavalier'' describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail.

He was a recurring character in the Showtime series ''[[The Tudors]]'', opposite [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Natalie Dormer]] as [[Anne Boleyn]]. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte.

He and his court set the scene for [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ballad ''[[Der Handschuh]]'' (''The Glove'').

Francis I (played by [[Timothy West]]) and Francis's son Henry II (played by [[Dougray Scott]]) are central figures in the 1998 movie ''[[Ever After]]'', a retelling of the [[Cinderella]] story.  The plot includes [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (played by [[Patrick Godfrey]]) arriving at Francis's court with the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''.

He is played by [[Alfonso Bassave]] in the [[Televisión Española|TVE]] series ''[[Carlos, rey emperador]]'', opposite [[Álvaro Cervantes]] as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].

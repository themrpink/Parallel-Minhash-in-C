Austria-Hungary broke apart at the end of World War I. Late in October 1918, an independent [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] state, consisting of the lands of the Bohemian kingdom and areas belonging to the Kingdom of Hungary, was proclaimed. The German deputies of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] (''Reichsrat'') referred to the [[Fourteen Points]] of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and the right proposed therein to [[self-determination]], and attempted to negotiate the union of the German-speaking territories with the new Republic of [[German Austria]], which itself aimed at joining [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]].

The German-speaking parts of the former [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] remained in a newly created [[Czechoslovakia]], a multi-ethnic state of several nations: [[Czechs]], [[Germans]], [[Slovaks]], [[Hungarians]], [[Poles]] and [[Ruthenians]]. On 20 September 1918, the [[Prague]] government asked the [[United States]]'s opinion for the Sudetenland. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] sent Ambassador [[Archibald Coolidge]] into [[Czechoslovakia]].  Coolidge insisted that the German-inhabited regions of West and North Bohemia remain within Czechoslovakia. The American delegation at the Paris talks, with [[Allen Welsh Dulles|Allen Dulles]] as the American's chief diplomat in the Czechoslovak Commission who emphasized preserving the unity of the Czech lands, decided not to follow Coolidge's proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwI9AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sudeten+germans+in+Czechoslovakia&amp;pg=PA200 |title=Czechoslovakia Before Munich |first=Johann Wolfgang |last=Bruegel |work=Cambridge University Press |year=1973 |page= 44|isbn=9780521086875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four regional governmental units were established:

* [[Province of German Bohemia]] (''Provinz Deutschböhmen''), the regions of northern and western Bohemia; proclaimed a constitutive state (''Land'') of the German-Austrian Republic with [[Liberec|Reichenberg]] (Liberec) as capital, administered by a ''[[Landeshauptmann]]'' (state captain), consecutively: Rafael Pacher (1857–1936), 29 October – 6 November 1918, and Rudolf Ritter von Lodgman von Auen (1877–1962), 6 November – 16 December 1918 (the last principal city was conquered by the Czech army but he continued in exile, first at Zittau in Saxony and then in Vienna, until 24 September 1919).
* [[Province of the Sudetenland]] (''Provinz Sudetenland''), the regions of northern [[Moravia]] and [[Austrian Silesia]]; proclaimed a constituent state of the German-Austrian Republic with [[Opava|Troppau]] (Opava) as capital, governed by a ''Landeshauptmann'': Robert Freissler (1877–1950), 30 October – 18 December 1918. This province's boundaries do not correspond to what would later be called the Sudetenland, which contained all the German-speaking parts of the Czech lands.
* [[Bohemian Forest Region]] (''Böhmerwaldgau''), the region of [[Bohemian Forest]]/[[South Bohemia]]; proclaimed a district (''Kreis'') of the existing Austrian Land of [[Upper Austria]]; administered by ''Kreishauptmann'' (district captain): Friedrich Wichtl (1872–1922) from 30 October 1918.
* [[German South Moravia]] (''Deutschsüdmähren''), proclaimed a District (''Kreis'') of the existing Austrian land [[Lower Austria]], administered by a ''Kreishauptmann'': Oskar Teufel (1880–1946) from 30 October 1918.

The U.S. commission to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] issued a declaration which gave unanimous support for &quot;unity of Czech lands&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LwI9AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sudeten+germans+in+Czechoslovakia&amp;pg=PA200 |title=Czechoslovakia Before Munich |first=Johann Wolfgang |last=Bruegel |work=Cambridge University Press |year=1973 |page= 45|isbn=9780521086875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the declaration stated:

{{quote|The Commission was...unanimous in its recommendation that the separation of all areas inhabited by the German-Bohemians would not only expose Czechoslovakia to great dangers but equally create great difficulties for the Germans themselves. The only practicable solution was to incorporate these Germans into Czechoslovakia.}}

Several [[Germans|German]] minorities according to their mother tongue in Moravia—including [[German language|German]]-speaking populations in [[Brno]], [[Jihlava]], and [[Olomouc]]—also attempted to proclaim their union with German Austria, but failed. The Czechs thus rejected the aspirations of the German Bohemians and demanded the inclusion of the lands inhabited by ethnic Germans in their state, despite the presence of more than 90% (as of 1921) ethnic Germans (which led to the presence of 23.4% of Germans in all of Czechoslovakia), on the grounds they had always been part of lands of the Bohemian Crown. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] in 1919 affirmed the inclusion of the German-speaking territories within Czechoslovakia. Over the next two decades, some Germans in the Sudetenland continued to strive for a separation of the German-inhabited regions from Czechoslovakia.

===Within the Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938)===

[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|Flag flown by Sudeten Germans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flaggenlexikon.de/fsudeten.htm |title=Sudetenland (flag) |publisher=Flaggenlexikon.de |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to the February 1921 census, 3,123,000 native German speakers lived in Czechoslovakia—23.4% of the total population. The controversies between the Czechs and the German-speaking minority lingered on throughout the 1920s, and intensified in the 1930s.

During the [[Great Depression]] the mostly mountainous regions populated by the German minority, together with other peripheral regions of [[Czechoslovakia]], were hurt by the [[economic depression]] more than the interior of the country. Unlike the less developed regions ([[Ruthenia]], [[Moravian Wallachia]]), the Sudetenland had a high concentration of vulnerable export-dependent industries (such as glass works, [[textile industry]], paper-making, and toy-making industry). Sixty percent of the [[Costume jewellery|bijouterie]] and glass-making industry were located in the Sudetenland, 69% of employees in this sector were Germans speaking according to mother tongue, and 95% of bijouterie and 78% of other glassware was produced for export. The glass-making sector was affected by decreased spending power and also by protective measures in other countries and many German workers lost their work.&lt;ref&gt;Kárník, Zdeněk. České země v éře první republiky (1918–1938). Díl 2. Praha 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The high unemployment, as well as the imposition of Czech in schools and all public spaces, made people more open to [[populism|populist]] and extremist movements such as [[fascism]], [[communism]], and German [[irredentism]]. In these years, the parties of German nationalists and later the [[Sudeten German National Socialist Party]] (SdP) with its radical demands gained immense popularity among [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Germans in Czechoslovakia]].

===Sudeten Crisis===
{{main|Munich Agreement|German occupation of Czechoslovakia}}
[[File:Zamazávání českých nápisů 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Czech language|Czech]] inscriptions smeared by Sudeten German activists, March 1938, [[Teplice]] ({{lang-de|Teplitz}})]]

The increasing aggressiveness of Hitler prompted the Czechoslovak military to build extensive [[Czechoslovak border fortifications|border fortifications]] starting in 1936 to defend the troubled border region. Immediately after the ''[[Anschluß]]'' of [[Austria]] into the [[Third Reich]] in March 1938, Hitler made himself the advocate of ethnic Germans living in Czechoslovakia, triggering the &quot;Sudeten Crisis&quot;. The following month, Sudeten Nazis, led by [[Konrad Henlein]], agitated for autonomy. On 24 April 1938 the SdP proclaimed the [[Karlsbader Programm]], which demanded in eight points the complete equality between the [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Sudeten Germans]] and the [[Czechs|Czech]] people. The government accepted these claims on 30 June 1938.{{Clarify|date=April 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;Zayas, Alfred Maurice de: Die Nemesis von Potsdam. Die Anglo-Amerikaner und die Vertreibung der Deutschen, überarb. u. erweit. Neuauflage, Herbig-Verlag, München, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, [[UK|British]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] sent [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Lord Runciman]] on a [[Runciman Mission|Mission to Czechoslovakia]] in order to see if he could obtain a settlement between the Czechoslovak government and the Germans in the Sudetenland. Lord Runciman's first day included meetings with President Beneš and Prime Minister [[Milan Hodža]] as well as a direct meeting with the Sudeten Germans from Henlein's SdP. On the next day he met with Dr and Mme Beneš and later met non-Nazi Germans in his hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788287-1,00.html |title=CZECHOSLOVAKIA: Pax Runciman |magazine=TIME |date=1938-08-15 |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full account of his report—including summaries of the conclusions of his meetings with the various parties—which he made in person to the Cabinet on his return to Britain is found in the Document CC 39(38).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/cabinet-gov/cab23-interwar-conclusions.htm#Cabinet%20Conclusions%201937%20to%201939 |title=The Cabinet Papers &amp;#124; CAB 23 interwar conclusions |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Runciman&lt;ref&gt;Note, what he reports is an expression of his opinion on the situation. He may have been entirely mistaken on this, but it helps us to understand how he saw the situation. For example, that he felt that the Czechoslovakian government being blind to the situation, does not make it true.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed sadness that he could not bring about agreement with the various parties, but he agreed with [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] that the time gained was important. He reported on the situation of the Sudeten Germans, and he gave details of four plans which had been proposed to deal with the crisis, each of which had points which, he reported, made it unacceptable to the other parties to the negotiations.

The four were: Transfer of the Sudetenland to the Reich; hold a [[plebiscite]] on the transfer of the Sudetenland to the Reich, organize a Four Power Conference on the matter, create a federal Czechoslovakia. At the meeting, he said that he was very reluctant to offer his own solution; he had not seen this as his task. The most that he said was that the great centres of opposition were in Eger and Asch, in the northwestern corner of Bohemia, which contained about 800,000 Germans and very few others.

He did say that the transfer of these areas to Germany would almost certainly be a good thing; he added that the Czechoslovak army would certainly oppose this very strongly, and that Beneš had said that they would fight rather than accept it.&lt;ref&gt;http://filestore.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pdfs/large/cab-23-95.pdf p. 71; CC 39(38) p 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] met [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Berchtesgaden]] on 15 September and agreed to the [[cession]] of the Sudetenland; three days later, French Prime Minister [[Édouard Daladier]] did the same. No Czechoslovak representative was invited to these discussions. Germany was now able to walk into the Sudetenland without firing a shot.

Chamberlain met Hitler in [[Bad Godesberg|Godesberg]] on 22 September to confirm the agreements. Hitler, aiming to use the crisis as a pretext for war, now demanded not only the annexation of the Sudetenland but the immediate military occupation of the territories, giving the Czechoslovak army no time to adapt their defence measures to the new borders.

Hitler in a speech at the Sportpalast in Berlin claimed that the Sudetenland was &quot;the last territorial demand I have to make in Europe&quot;&lt;ref name=sudetenland1&gt;{{cite book|author1=Max Domarus|author2=Adolf Hitler|title=Hitler: speeches and proclamations, 1932–1945: the chronicle of a dictatorship|year=1990|page=1393}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave Czechoslovakia a deadline of 28 September at 2:00 p.m. to cede the Sudetenland to Germany or face war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Santi Corvaja 2008. Pp. 73&quot;&gt;Santi Corvaja, Robert L. Miller. Hitler &amp; Mussolini: The Secret Meetings. New York, New York, USA: Enigma Books, 2008. {{ISBN|9781929631421}}. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve a solution, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] suggested a conference of the major powers in [[Munich]] and on 29 September, Hitler, Daladier and Chamberlain met and agreed to Mussolini's proposal (actually prepared by [[Hermann Göring]]) and signed the [[Munich Agreement]], accepting the immediate occupation of the Sudetenland. The Czechoslovak government, though not party to the talks, submitted to compulsion and promised to abide by the agreement on 30 September.

The Sudetenland was assigned to Germany between 1 October and 10 October 1938. The Czech part of Czechoslovakia was subsequently [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|invaded by Germany]] in March 1939, with a portion being annexed and the remainder turned into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. The Slovak part declared its independence from Czechoslovakia, becoming the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]] (Slovak State), a satellite state and ally of Germany. (The Ruthenian part&amp;nbsp;– Subcarpathian Rus&amp;nbsp;– made also an attempt to declare its sovereignty as [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] but only with ephemeral success. This area was annexed by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]].)

Part of the borderland was also invaded and [[Zaolzie#Part of Poland (1938–1939)|annexed by Poland]].

===Sudetenland as part of Germany===
[[File:Sloučení SdP a NSDAP.jpg|thumb|Combining [[Sudeten German Party]] and [[NSDAP]], October 1938]]

The Sudetenland was initially put under military administration, with General [[Wilhelm Keitel]] as military governor. On 21 October 1938, the annexed territories were divided, with the southern parts being incorporated into the neighbouring Reichsgaue ''[[Reichsgau Niederdonau|Niederdonau]]'', ''[[Reichsgau Oberdonau|Oberdonau]]''  and ''[[Gau Bayreuth|Bayerische Ostmark]]''.

[[File:Volební fraška v Sudetech.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Election ballot, Reichsgau Sudetenland, December 1938]]

The northern and western parts were reorganized as the [[Reichsgau Sudetenland|Reichsgau ''Sudetenland'']], with the city of Reichenberg (present-day [[Liberec]]) established as its capital. [[Konrad Henlein]] (now openly a [[NSDAP]] member) administered the district first as ''[[Reichskommissar]]'' (until 1 May 1939) and then as ''[[Reichsstatthalter]]'' (1 May 1939&amp;nbsp;– 4 May 1945). The Sudetenland consisted of three administrative districts (''[[Regierungsbezirk]]e''): [[Egerland|Eger]] (with [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]] as capital), [[Ústí nad Labem Region|Aussig]] ([[Ústí nad Labem|Aussig]]) and [[Opava District|Troppau]] ([[Opava|Troppau]]).

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0008, Sudetenland, Besuch Wilhelm Frick (cropped Konrad Henlein).jpg|thumb|''Sudetenland'' was administered by Konrad Henlein for the duration of the war]]

Beginning before the occupation, Jews in the area were targeted during [[the Holocaust in the Sudetenland]]. Only a few weeks afterwards, the [[Kristallnacht]] occurred. As elsewhere in Germany, many synagogues were set on fire and numerous leading Jews were sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Jews and Czechs were not the only afflicted peoples; German socialists, communists and pacifists were widely persecuted as well. Some of the German socialists fled the Sudetenland via Prague and London to other countries. The [[Gleichschaltung]] would permanently alter the community in the Sudetenland.

Despite this, on 4 December 1938 there were elections in Reichsgau Sudetenland, in which 97.32% of the adult population voted for [[NSDAP]]. About a half million Sudeten Germans joined the [[Nazi Party]] which was 17.34% of the total German population in the Sudetenland (the average NSDAP membership participation in [[Germany]] was merely 7.85% in 1944). This means the Sudetenland was one of the most pro-Nazi regions of the Third Reich.&lt;ref name=zimmermann&gt;Zimmermann, Volker: Die Sudetendeutschen im NS-Staat. Politik und Stimmung der Bevölkerung im Reichsgau Sudetenland (1938–1945). Essen 1999. ({{ISBN|3-88474-770-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their knowledge of the [[Czech language]], many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the [[Czech people|ethnic Czech]] [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] as well as in Nazi organizations (Gestapo, etc.). The most notable was [[Karl Hermann Frank]]: the SS and Police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.

===Expulsions and resettlement after World War II===
{{main|Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia}}
[[File:Vertreibung.jpg|thumb|The [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]] as the result of the end of World War II]]
[[File:Vertreibung 1938.gif|thumb|From the territory occupied by the Third Reich, 160,000 to 170,000 Czech-speaking inhabitants were forced to leave or were expelled]]

Shortly after the liberation of Czechoslovakia in May 1945, the use of the term ''Sudety'' (Sudetenland) in official communications was banned and replaced by the term ''pohraniční území'' (border territory).&lt;ref&gt;Zdeněk Beneš. ''Facing history: the evolution of Czech-German relations in the Czech provinces, 1848–1948''. Gallery, 2002. p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II in the summer of 1945 the [[Potsdam Conference]]  decided that Sudeten Germans would have to leave Czechoslovakia (see [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|Expulsion of Germans after World War II]]). As a consequence of the immense hostility against all Germans that had grown within Czechoslovakia due to Nazi behavior, the overwhelming majority of Germans were expelled (while the relevant Czechoslovak legislation provided for the remaining Germans who were able to prove their anti-Nazi affiliation).

The number of expelled Germans in the early phase (spring-summer 1945) is estimated to be around 500,000 people. Following the Beneš decrees and starting in 1946, the majority of the Germans were expelled and in 1950 only 159,938 (from 3,149,820 in 1930) still lived in the Czech Republic. The remaining Germans, proven anti-fascists and skilled laborers, were allowed to stay in Czechoslovakia, but were later forcefully dispersed within the country.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Přesun v rámci rozptylu občanů německé národnosti.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Some German refugees from Czechoslovakia are represented by the [[Sudetendeutsche Landsmannschaft]].
[[File:Sudetenland wappen.gif|thumb|left|Coat of arms of ''Sudetendeutsche Landsmannschaft'']]
Many of the Germans who stayed in Czechoslovakia later emigrated to [[West Germany]] (more than 100,000). As the German population was transferred out of the country, the former Sudetenland was resettled, mostly by [[Czechs]] but also by other nationalities of Czechoslovakia: [[Slovaks]], Greeks (arriving in the wake of the [[Greek Civil War]] 1946–49), [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]ns, [[Romani people]] and [[Jews]] who had survived the [[Holocaust]], and [[Hungarians]] (though the Hungarians were forced into this and later returned home—see [[Hungarians in Slovakia#Population exchanges|Hungarians in Slovakia: Population exchanges]]).

Some areas—such as part of Czech Silesian-Moravian borderland, southwestern Bohemia ([[Šumava National Park]]), western and northern parts of Bohemia—remained depopulated for several strategic reasons (extensive mining and military interests) or are now protected national parks and landscapes. Moreover, before the establishment of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1952–55, the so-called &quot;forbidden zone&quot; was established (by means of [[Czechoslovak border fortifications during the Cold War|engineer equipment]]) up to 2&amp;nbsp;km (1.2&amp;nbsp;mi) from the border in which no civilians could reside. A wider region, or &quot;border zone&quot; existed, up to 12&amp;nbsp;km from the border, in which no &quot;disloyal&quot; or &quot;suspect&quot; civilians could reside or work. Thus, the entire [[Aš|Aš-Bulge]] fell within the border zone; this status remained until the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989.

There remained areas with noticeable German minorities in the westernmost borderland around [[Cheb]], where skilled ethnic German miners and workers continued in mining and industry until 1955, sanctioned under the [[Yalta Conference]] protocols;{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} in the [[Egerland]], German minority organizations continue to exist. Also, the small town of [[Kravaře]] ({{lang-de|Deutsch Krawarn}}) in the multiethnic [[Hlučín Region]] of [[Czech Silesia]] has an ethnic German majority (2006), including an ethnic German mayor.

In the 2001 census, approximately 40,000 people in the Czech Republic claimed German ethnicity.

'''''Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness''''' (1927) (also known simply as '''''Chang''''') is a [[silent film]] about a poor farmer in northern [[Nan Province]] (northern [[Thailand]]) and his daily struggle for survival in the jungle. The film was directed by [[Merian C. Cooper]] and [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Chang A Drama of the Wilderness (1927)|first=Mordaunt|last=Hall|authorlink=Mordaunt Hall|date=April 30, 1927|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE0DD163CE733A25753C3A9629C946695D6CF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released by [[Famous Players-Lasky]], a division of [[Paramount Pictures]].

==Plot==
Kru, the farmer depicted in the film, battles leopards, tigers, and even a herd of elephants, all of which pose a constant threat to his livelihood. As filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack attempted to capture real life with their cameras, though they often re-staged events that had not been captured adequately on film. The danger was real to all the people and animals involved. Tigers, leopards, and bears are slaughtered on camera,&lt;ref name=&quot;BP-20190721&quot; /&gt; while the film's climax shows Kru's house being demolished by a stampeding elephant.

==Legal status==
[[File:Pyle pirates approaching ship.jpg|thumb|Howard Pyle &amp;ndash; Buccaneers attacking a much larger Spanish galleon]]

Sometimes the buccaneers held more or less regular commissions as privateers, and they always preyed upon the Spaniards; but often they became mere pirates and plundered any nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As a rule, the buccaneers called themselves privateers, and many sailed under the protection of a [[letter of marque]] granted by British, French or Dutch authorities.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  For example, [[Henry Morgan]] had some form of legal cover for all of his attacks, and expressed great indignation at being called a &quot;corsair&quot; by the governor of Panama.&lt;ref&gt;Cawthorne, Nigel (2004), ''Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas'', Book Sales, {{ISBN|0785818561}}, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, these rough men had little concern for legal niceties, and exploited every opportunity to pillage Spanish targets, whether or not a letter of marque was available. Many of the letters of marque used by buccaneers were legally invalid, and any form of legal paper in that illiterate age might be passed off as a letter of marque.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Breverton|Breverton, Terry]] (2004). ''The Pirate Dictionary'', Pelican, {{ISBN|1589802438}}, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, even those buccaneers who had valid letters of marque often failed to observe their terms; Morgan's 1671 attack on [[Panama]], for instance, was not at all authorised by his commission from the governor of [[Jamaica]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The legal status of buccaneers was still further obscured by the practice of the Spanish authorities, who regarded them as heretics and interlopers, and thus hanged or garroted captured buccaneers entirely without regard to whether their attacks were licensed by French or English monarchs.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Simultaneously, French and English governors tended to turn a blind eye to the buccaneers' depredations against the Spanish, even when unlicensed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} But as Spanish power waned toward the end of the 17th century, the buccaneers' attacks began to disrupt France and England's merchant traffic with [[Spanish Empire|Spanish America]], such that merchants who had previously regarded the buccaneers as a defence against Spain now saw them as a threat to commerce, and colonial authorities grew hostile.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This change in political atmosphere, more than anything else, put an end to buccaneering.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Lifestyle==

A hundred years before the [[French Revolution]], the buccaneer companies were run on lines in which [[liberty]], [[social equality|equality]] and [[fraternity]] were the rule. In a buccaneer camp, the captain was elected and could be deposed by the votes of the crew. The crew, and not the captain, decided whether to attack a particular ship, or a fleet of ships. Spoils were evenly divided into shares; the captain received an agreed amount for the ship, plus a portion of the share of the [[prize money]], usually five or six shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D. |last=Cordingley, D |title=Under the Black Flag |publisher=Random House |year=2006 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crews generally had no regular wages, being paid only from their shares of the plunder, a system called &quot;[[no purchase, no pay]]&quot; by Modyford or &quot;no prey, no pay&quot; by Exquemelin. There was a strong ''esprit'' among buccaneers. This, combined with overwhelming numbers, allowed them to win battles and raids. There was also, for some time, a social insurance system guaranteeing compensation for battle wounds at a worked-out scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Salmon (historian)|Thomas Salmon]] (1746), ''Modern history, or the Present State of All nations'', University of Lausanne p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval===
Buccaneers initially used small boats to attack Spanish galleons surreptitiously, often at night, and climb aboard before the alarm could be raised. Buccaneers were expert [[marksman|marksmen]] and would quickly kill the [[helmsman]] and any officers aboard. Buccaneers' reputation as cruel pirates grew to the point that, eventually, most victims would surrender, hoping they would not be killed.&lt;ref name=pirates&amp;privateers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cindyvallar.com/buccaneers.html|title=The Buccaneers|author=Vallar, Cindy|date=1 November 2002|work=Pirates and Privateers: The History of Maritime Piracy|format=self-published work|via=cindyvallar.com|access-date=9 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115435/http://www.cindyvallar.com/buccaneers.html|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2017}}

===Land===

When buccaneers raided towns, they did not sail into port and bombard the defences, as naval forces typically did. Instead, they secretly beached their ships out of sight of their target, marched overland, and attacked the towns from the landward side, which was usually less fortified. Their raids relied mainly on surprise and speed.&lt;ref name=pirates&amp;privateers /&gt;{{better source|date=January 2017}} The [[Sack of Campeche (1663)|sack of Campeche]] was considered the first such raid and many others that followed replicated the same techniques including the [[attack on Veracruz]] in 1683 and the [[Raid on Cartagena (1683)|raid on Cartagena]] later that same year.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Downturn==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
While Spanish authorities always viewed buccaneers as trespassers and a threat to their hegemony in the Caribbean basin, over the second half of the 17th century other European powers learned to perceive them in the same way. These new powers had appropriated and secured territories in the area and needed to protect them. Buccaneers who did not settle down on agriculture or some other acceptable business after the so-called [[Golden Age of Piracy]] proved a nuisance to them, too. Spanish anti-pirate practices became thus a model for all recently arrived colonial governments. Some expanded them.

==Punishments==
When caught by anti-pirate English authorities, 17th and 18th century buccaneers received justice in a summary fashion, and many ended their lives by &quot;dancing the hempen jig&quot;, a euphemism for hanging. Public executions were a form of entertainment, and people came out to watch them as they would for a sporting event today. Newspapers reported details such as condemned men's last words, the prayers said by the priests, and descriptions of their final moments in the gallows. In England, most executions took place at [[Execution Dock]] on the [[River Thames]] in [[London]].

In the cases of more famous prisoners, usually captains, their punishments extended beyond death. Their bodies were enclosed in [[Gibbeting|iron cages (gibbet)]] (for which they were measured before their execution) and left to swing in the air until the flesh rotted off them—a process that could take as long as two years. The bodies of captains such as [[William Kidd|William &quot;Captain&quot; Kidd]], [[Charles Vane]], [[William Fly]], and [[Calico Jack|Jack Rackham (&quot;Calico Jack&quot;)]] were all treated this way.

It is doubtful many buccaneers got off with just a time in the pillory. However, a pirate who was flogged could very well spend some time in the pillory after being beaten. &quot;The most common shaming punishment was confinement in the pillory often with symbols of their crimes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruff|first1=Julius R.|title=Violence in early modern Europe|url=https://archive.org/details/violenceinearlym0000ruff|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521591195|page=[https://archive.org/details/violenceinearlym0000ruff/page/97 97]|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
After the threat began to abate, literature brought buccaneers to glory as example of virility and self-reliance. [[Daniel Defoe]]’s works like ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719), ''[[Captain Singleton]]'' (1720), and ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' (1724) (purported by Defoe) set the tone for the glamorous ways in which later generations would perceive them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Pillaging the Empire: Global Piracy on the High Seas, 1500-1750 |last=Lane |first=Kris |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=1317524470}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

'''René François Armand''' ('''Sully''') '''Prudhomme''' ({{IPA-fr|syli pʁydɔm|lang}}; 16 March 1839 – 6 September 1907) was a French poet and essayist. He was the first winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1901.

Born in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times. In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the [[Parnassianism|Parnassus school]], although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own.

==Early life==
Prudhomme was born to a French shopkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1901/prudhomme-bio.html|title=Sully Prudhomme – Biographical|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prudhomme attended the [[Lycée Condorcet|Lycée Bonaparte]], but eye trouble interrupted his studies. He worked for a while in the [[Le Creusot|Creusot]] region for the [[Schneider Electric|Schneider]] steel [[foundry]], and then began studying law in a notary's office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the ''Conférence La Bruyère'' (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.

==Writing==
His first collection, ''Stances et Poèmes'' (&quot;Stanzas and Poems&quot;, 1865), was praised by [[Sainte-Beuve]]. It included his most famous poem, ''Le vase brisé''. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. This war, which he discussed in ''Impressions de la guerre'' (1872) and ''La France'' (1874), permanently damaged his health.

During his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the [[Parnassianism|Parnassus]] school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. One of his inspirations was clearly [[Lucretius]]'s ''[[De rerum natura]]'', whose first book he translated into verse. His philosophy was expressed in ''La Justice'' (1878) and ''Le Bonheur'' (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1881. Another distinction, ''Chevalier de la [[Légion d’honneur]]'', was to follow in 1895.

After, ''Le Bonheur'', Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on [[aesthetics]] and philosophy. He published two important essays: ''L'Expression dans les beaux-arts'' (1884) and ''Réflexions sur l'art des vers'' (1892), a series of articles on [[Blaise Pascal]] in ''[[La Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' (1890), and an article on [[free will]] (''La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre'', 1906) in the ''Revue de métaphysique et de morale''.

==Nobel Prize==
The first writer to receive the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (given &quot;in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of [[lofty idealism]], artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect&quot;), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the ''[[Société des gens de lettres]]''. He also founded, in 1902, the ''[[Société des poètes français]]'' with [[Jose-Maria de Heredia]] and [[Leon Dierx]].

==Death==
[[File:SullyPrudhommetomb.JPG|thumb|Grave of Sully Prudhomme at [[Père-Lachaise]] in Paris.]]
At the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a [[recluse]] at [[Châtenay-Malabry]], suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at [[Père-Lachaise]] in Paris.

      <text bytes="38320" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Notions of probabilistic convergence, applied to estimation and asymptotic analysis}}
In [[probability theory]], there exist several different notions of '''convergence of random variables'''.  The [[limit of a sequence|convergence]] of [[sequence]]s of [[random variable]]s to some [[Limit of a sequence|limit]] random variable is an important concept in probability theory, and its applications to [[statistics]] and [[stochastic process]]es. The same concepts are known in more general [[mathematics]] as '''stochastic convergence''' and they formalize the idea that a sequence of essentially random or unpredictable events can sometimes be expected to settle down into a behavior that is essentially unchanging when items far enough into the sequence are studied. The different possible notions of convergence relate to how such a behavior can be characterized: two readily understood behaviors are that the sequence eventually takes a constant value, and that values in the sequence continue to change but can be described by an unchanging probability distribution.

==Background==
&quot;Stochastic convergence&quot; formalizes the idea that a sequence of essentially random or unpredictable events can sometimes be expected to settle into a pattern. The pattern may for instance be
*[[Limit of a sequence|Convergence]] in the classical sense to a fixed value,  perhaps itself coming from a random event
*An increasing similarity of outcomes to what a purely deterministic function would produce
*An increasing preference towards a certain outcome
*An increasing &quot;aversion&quot; against straying far away from a certain outcome
*That the probability distribution describing the next outcome may grow increasingly similar to a certain distribution

Some less obvious, more theoretical patterns could be
*That the series formed by calculating the [[expected value]] of the outcome's distance from a particular value may converge to 0
*That the variance of the [[random variable]] describing the next event grows smaller and smaller.
These other types of patterns that may arise are reflected in the different types of stochastic convergence that have been studied.

While the above discussion has related to the convergence of a single series to a limiting value, the notion of the convergence of two series towards each other is also important, but this is easily handled by studying the sequence defined as either the difference or the ratio of the two series.

For example, if the average of ''n'' [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] random variables ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n'', all having the same finite [[mean]] and [[variance]], is given by

:&lt;math&gt;X_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\,,&lt;/math&gt;

then as ''n'' tends to infinity, {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} converges ''in probability'' (see below) to the common [[mean]], μ, of the random variables ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  This result is known as the [[weak law of large numbers]].  Other forms of convergence are important in other useful theorems, including the [[central limit theorem]].

Throughout the following, we assume that (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sequence of random variables, and ''X'' is a random variable, and all of them are defined on the same [[probability space]]  &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \operatorname{Pr} )&lt;/math&gt;.

The outcome from tossing any of them will follow a distribution markedly different from the desired [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]]. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the factory is improved, the dice become less and less loaded, and the outcomes from tossing a newly produced die will follow the uniform distribution more and more closely.

The subsequent random variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} will all be distributed [[Binomial distribution|binomially]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As {{mvar|n}} grows larger, this distribution will gradually start to take shape more and more similar to the [[Normal distribution|bell curve]] of the normal distribution. If we shift and rescale {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} appropriately, then &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_n = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}(X_n-\mu)&lt;/math&gt; will be '''converging in distribution''' to the standard normal, the result that follows from the celebrated [[central limit theorem]].
  | header5 = Graphic example
  | data6   = Suppose {{math|{''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''} }} is an [[Independent and identically distributed|iid]] sequence of [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] {{math|''U''(−1, 1)}} random variables. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_n = {\scriptscriptstyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i&lt;/math&gt; be their (normalized) sums. Then according to the [[central limit theorem]], the distribution of {{mvar|Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} approaches the normal {{math|''N''(0, {{sfrac|1|3}})}} distribution. This convergence is shown in the picture: as {{mvar|n}} grows larger, the shape of the probability density function gets closer and closer to the Gaussian curve.
[[Image:Convergence in distribution (sum of uniform rvs).gif|center|200px]]}}

With this mode of convergence,  we increasingly expect to see the next outcome in a sequence of random experiments becoming better and better modeled by a given [[probability distribution]].

Convergence in distribution is the weakest form of convergence typically discussed, since it is implied by all other types of convergence mentioned in this article. However, convergence in distribution is very frequently used in practice; most often it arises from application of the [[central limit theorem]].

===Definition===
A sequence {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} of real-valued [[random variable]]s is said to '''converge in distribution''', or '''converge weakly''', or '''converge in law''' to a random variable {{mvar|X}} if

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} F_n(x) = F(x),&lt;/math&gt;

for every number &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; at which {{mvar|F}} is [[continuous function|continuous]]. Here {{mvar|F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|F}} are the [[cumulative distribution function]]s of random variables {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|X}}, respectively.

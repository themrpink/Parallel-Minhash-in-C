'''Tindari''' ({{IPA-it|ˈtindari|lang}}; {{lang-scn|Lu Tìnnaru}} {{IPA-scn|lʊ ˈtinnaɾʊ|}}), ancient '''Tyndaris''' ({{lang-grc|Τυνδαρίς}}, [[Strabo|Strab.]]) or '''Tyndarion''' ({{lang|grc|Τυνδάριον}}, [[Ptolemy|Ptol.]]), is a small town, ''[[frazione]]'' (suburb or municipal component) in the ''[[comune]]'' of [[Patti, Sicily|Patti]] and a Latin Catholic [[titular see]].

The monumental ruins of ancient Tyndaris are a main attraction for visitors and excavations are continuing to reveal more parts of the city.

Tindari has a famous [[sanctuary]] and is also famous for the [[poem]] ''Vento a Tindari'', written by [[Salvatore Quasimodo]].

== History ==
[[File:Tindary greek ruins.jpg|thumb|The monumental propylaeum gate from the inside]]
[[File:Tindari Domus 08 09 2012 06.jpg|thumb|300px|Roman ''[[Domus]]'']]

Ancient Tyndaris was strategically situated on its prominent hill overlooking the wide bay of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] bounded by the Punta di Milazzo on the east, and the Capo Calavà on the west. 

It was one of the latest of all the cities in Sicily that could claim a purely Greek origin, having been founded by the [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|elder Dionysius]] in 396 or 395 BC. The original settlers were the remains of the [[Messenia]]n exiles, who had been driven from [[Naupactus]], [[Zacynthus]], and the [[Peloponnesia|Peloponnese]] by the [[Sparta]]ns after the close of [[the Peloponnesian War]]. These had at first been established by Dionysius at Messana, when he repeopled that city; but the Spartans having taken umbrage at this, he transferred them to the site of Tyndaris, which had previously been included in the territory of [[Abacaenum]]. The colonists themselves gave to their new city the name of Tyndaris, from their native divinities, the &quot;Tyndaridae&quot; or [[Dioscuri]], and readily admitting fresh citizens from other quarters, soon raised their whole population to the number of 5000 citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus]] xiv. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The new city thus rose at once to be a place of considerable importance.

It is next mentioned in 344 BC, when it was one of the first cities that declared in favor of [[Timoleon]] after his landing in Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xvi. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; At a later period we find it mentioned as espousing the cause of [[Hiero II|Hieron]], and supporting him during his war against the Mamertines, 269 BC. On that occasion he rested his position upon Tyndaris on the left, and on Tauromenium (modern [[Taormina]]) on the right.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xxii. Exc. H. p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the strong position of Tyndaris made it an important strategic post on the Tyrrhenian sea, as Tauromenium was on the Sicilian sea, and hence we find it frequently mentioned in accounts of subsequent wars. In the [[First Punic War]] it was at first dependent upon [[Carthage]]; and though the citizens, alarmed at the progress of the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] armies, were at one time on the point of turning to Rome, they were restrained by the Carthaginians, who carried off all the chief citizens as hostages.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xxiii. p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt; In 257 BC, the [[Battle of Tyndaris]] took place off the coast of Tyndaris, between the city and the [[Lipara|Liparaean islands]], in which a Roman fleet under [[Gaius Atilius Regulus (consul 257 BC)|Gaius Atilius Regulus]] obtained some advantage over the Carthaginian fleet, but without any decisive result.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]] i. 25; Zonar. viii. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman fleet is described on that occasion as touching at the promontory of Tyndaris, but the city had not yet fallen into their hands, and it was not until after the fall of Panormus (modern [[Palermo]]) in 254 BC that Tyndaris expelled the Carthaginian garrison and joined the Roman alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xxiii. p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

We hear little of Tyndaris under Roman government, but it appears to have been a flourishing and considerable city. [[Cicero]] calls it ''nobilissima civitas''&lt;ref&gt;''[[In Verrem]]'' iii. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; and we learn from him that the inhabitants had displayed their zeal and fidelity towards the Romans upon many occasions. Among others they supplied naval forces for the armament of [[Scipio Africanus the Younger]], a service for which he repaid them by restoring to them a statue of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] which had been carried off by the Carthaginians and which continued as an object of great veneration in the city, until it was stolen by the rapacious [[Verres]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''In Verrem'' iv. 3. 9-42, v. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Tyndaris was also one of seventeen cities selected by the [[Roman senate]], apparently as an honorary distinction, to contribute to certain offerings to the temple of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] at [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''In Verrem'' v. 47; Zumpt, ''ad loc.''; Diod. iv. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In other respects it had no peculiar privileges, and was in the condition of an ordinary [[municipium|municipal town]], with its own magistrates, local senate, etc., but was certainly in the time of Cicero one of the most considerable places in the island. It, however, suffered severely from the exactions of Verres&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''In Verrem'' ''ll. cc.''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the inhabitants, to revenge themselves on their oppressor, publicly demolished his statue as soon as he had quit the island.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''In Verrem'' ii. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyndaris again bore a considerable part in the [[Sicilian revolt]] between [[Sextus Pompeius]] and [[Octavian]]. It was one of the points occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the Sicilian straits, but was taken by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] after his naval victory at [[Mylae]], and became one of his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, ''B.C.'' v. 105, 109, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, to this we hear nothing more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Strabo]] speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] gives it the title of a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|Colonia]]''. It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as we find it bearing in an inscription the titles of ''Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum''.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo vi. p. 272; Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Ptol. iii. 4. § 2; Orell. ''Inscr.'' 955.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (he tells us) half of it was swallowed up by the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, but we have no clue to the date of this event;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ii. 92. s. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently still as a considerable place, in the fourth century.&lt;ref&gt;Itin. Ant. pp. 90, 93; Tab. Peut.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecclesiastical History ==

* Established in 498 as Diocese of Tindari (Italian) / Tyndaris (Latin) / Tyndaritan(us) (Latin adjective). In the early 7th century Sicily had no [[Metropolitan see]], so although politically part of the [[Byzantine empire]], all its bishoprics were in the sway of the papal ('Western') [[Patriarchate of Rome]] as (exempt) [[suffragan diocese]]s of Rome. During the conflict on [[Iconoclasm]], [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian]] transferred all Sicily to his capital's [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] (circa 732); in the 8th or 9th century, the newly created Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Syracuse]] was given all Sicilian bishoprics as suffragans, including Tindari, where no bishops were recorded since 649.
* Although the [[Notitia Episcopatuum]] under emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] (early 10th century) still lists Tindari among the suffragans of Syracuse, that probably was just canonical theory, as in 836 Tindari was conquered for Islam by Arabs and nothing is heard from the diocese.
* Formally suppressed in 880 without direct successor, but lost (some) territory in 1082 to establish the short-lived [[Diocese of Troina]] (suppressed in 1098 to establish the [[Diocese of Messina]]). When Sicilia was again conquered and Christianize by the Normans in the 11th century, the bishopric wasn't restored, its territory rather assigned to the new [[Diocese of Patti]].

=== Titular see ===
The diocese was nominally restored in 1968 as Latin [[Titular bishopric]] of Tindari (Curiate Italian) / Tyndaris (Latin) / Tyndaritan(us) (Latin adjective)

== Remains ==
[[File:Tindari greek theatre 1.JPG|thumb|300px|Greek theatre]]

By the 19th century, the site of Tyndaris was wholly deserted, but the name was retained by a church, which crowned the most elevated point of the hill on which the city formerly stood, and was still called the Madonna di Tindaro. It is c. 180&amp;nbsp;m above the sea-level, and forms a conspicuous landmark to sailors. Considerable ruins of the ancient city, are also visible. It occupied the whole plateau or summit of the hill, and the remains of the ancient walls may be traced, at intervals, all round the brow of the cliffs, except in one part, facing the sea, where the cliff is now quite precipitous. It is not improbable that it is here that a part of the cliff fell in, in the manner recorded by Pliny&lt;ref&gt;ii. 92. s. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Two gates of the city are also still distinctly to be traced.

The chief monuments, of which the ruins are still extant within the circuit of the walls, are:
* the theatre, of which the remains are in imperfect condition, but sufficient to show that it was not of large size, and apparently of Roman construction, or at least, like that of Tauromenium, rebuilt in Roman times upon the Greek foundations
* a [[propylaeum]] with two handsome stone arches (previously called a Gymnasium)
* several other edifices of Roman times, but of wholly uncertain character, a mosaic pavement and some Roman tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Serra di Falco, ''Antichità della Sicilia'', vol. v. part vi.; [[William Henry Smyth]] ''Sicily'', p. 101; [[Sir Richard Hoare, 2nd Baronet|Richard Hoare]], ''Classical Tour'', vol. ii. p. 217, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Numerous inscriptions, fragments of sculpture, and architectural decorations, as well as coins, vases etc. have also been discovered on the site.

[[File:Patti Tindari Schwarze Madonna.jpg|thumb|The [[Black Madonna]] of Tindari celebrated the 7–8 September, inscribed ''NIGRA SUM SED FORMOSA'', meaning &quot;I am black but beautiful&quot;.]]

== Legend ==
Local legend tells that the lagoon was created after a pilgrim who came to see the Madonna refused to pray to the Madonna because she was [[Black Madonna|black]]. The woman accidentally dropped her baby into the ocean and the Madonna made the land rise to save the baby.  The sands of Marinello have taken shape of the profile of the Madonna.

'''Tallangatta''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|l|æ|ŋ|ɡ|æ|t|ə}}) is a town in north-eastern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. The town lies on the banks of the [[Mitta Mitta River|Mitta Arm]] of [[Lake Hume]], approximately {{convert|38|km|mi}} south-east of [[Albury-Wodonga]] along the [[Murray Valley Highway]]. At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, Tallangatta had a population of 1,082.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census2016&quot;/&gt;

==History==
Tallangatta was founded in the 1870s, the Post Office opening on 15 May 1871.&lt;ref name = &quot;a&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&amp;country= | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the arrival of the railway it served as a rail gateway for the [[Mitta Mitta River|Mitta]] and Upper [[Murray River|Murray]] [[valleys]] (the Upper Murray only until the railway was extended to [[Cudgewa, Victoria|Cudgewa]]).  A considerable amount of [[gold]] and [[tin]] mining occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century, though, unlike [[Beechworth]], little evidence of this remains. While initially profitable, the mining generally ended because the deeper reefs contained not only gold but other metals, and mining technology at the time was not advanced enough to cope with these and extract the gold profitably.

Since that time, Tallangatta has been a service centre for the local farming community, with a [[butter]] factory operating throughout much of the 20th century. Improved road transport links finally ended both the dairy and the rail link in the 1970s (with dairy processing operations now concentrated in [[Tangambalanga, Victoria|Tangambalanga]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} to the west).

The most distinctive aspect of the town's history is that it was moved {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} to the west in the 1950s to a site known as Bolga to allow for the expansion of Lake Hume. Stories of the transition from old town to new town were captured in the 1988 book ''Slates and Suet Puddings'' by Carmyl Winkler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/609846 |title=Slates and suet puddings  |first1=Carmyl |last1=Winkler |first2=Dulcie |last2=Callander |publisher=C. Winkler |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 1955 the Post Office was renamed Tallangatta East and a new Tallangatta office opened at the new town location.&lt;ref name = &quot;b&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&amp;country= | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign welcoming motorists to town reads &quot;Tallangatta, the town that moved in the 1950s&quot;.

The grid layout of the streets of Old Tallangatta are clearly visible in Google Earth.

The Tallangatta Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/images/stories/committees/lawrefrom/legal_services/final_report.pdf | title=Review of Legal Services in Rural and Regional Victoria | publisher=Parliament of Victoria Law Reform Committee | date=May 2001 | accessdate=12 April 2020 |pages=291–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
According to the 2016 Census the population of Tallangatta is 1,082, of which:&lt;ref&gt;http://quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/SSC22414&lt;/ref&gt;

* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.8% of the population
* 83.1% of people were born in Australia. 3.1% of the population was born in England, 1.2% in New Zealand, 0.9% in India, 0.8% in Germany and 0.7% in USA
* 92.3% of people spoke only English at home.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 28.1%, Anglican 22.9% Catholic 20.2%, and Uniting 8.4%.

==Economy==
Beef and dairy [[cattle]] farming is the dominant industry, with a small [[abattoir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiabigbook.com/1828/7 slaughterhouses listing], australiabigbook.com&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, Tallangatta was declared a &quot;Notable Town&quot;, by Heritage Australia. The main street is long for a town of its size and is quite unique. The unique architecture is home to a thriving retail and hospitality sector that contributes to local employment and tourism. Services include a small hospital,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albury-wodonga.com/docs/o.htm Hospitals in the Albury-Wodonga region], albury-wodonga.com&lt;/ref&gt; and two primary schools, a secondary school and an integrated childcare, library and community centre. A considerable number of residents now [[Commuting|commute]] to work in [[Albury–Wodonga]].

The decline of the water frontage of Lake Hume, due to sporadic drought conditions and the privatisation of Australia waterways, has had an impact on the town. Although through new initiatives, such as the Tallangatta Tomorrow project funded by state government, the township is experiencing a new lease on life.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

There are several successful community focused initiatives operating within the township including The Hub, the Uniting Church Op Shop, Tallangatta Food Swap, Plasticwise Tallangatta, Boomerang Bags Tallangatta, and the Tallangatta Community Theatre Group.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The town has a high proportion of retirees, with some elderly people cared for at Bolga Court Hostel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tallangattahealthservice.com.au/residential_aged_care/bolga_court.html], Shire of Towong&lt;/ref&gt;  This heritage is celebrated in the popular annual Tallangatta Fifties Festival;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tallangattafifties.com.au/ |title=Tallangatta Fifties Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, as of June 2018, has ended due to financial concerns and feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bunn|first=Anthony|date=2018-06-19|title=Not so nifty, Tallangatta no longer home to Fifties Festival|url=https://www.bordermail.com.au/story/5475129/not-so-nifty-tallangatta-no-longer-home-to-fifties-festival/|access-date=2020-08-25|website=The Border Mail|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Telluride is served by [[Telluride Regional Airport]]. Scheduled flight options are limited, due to the airport's somewhat short runway and frequent closures under bad weather, so most passengers going to Telluride use [[Montrose Regional Airport]], 67 miles to the north.

Free public transportation is provided in Telluride. The bus system, called ''Galloping Goose'', makes a complete loop around the town and the ''Gondola'' links Telluride with [[Mountain Village, Colorado|Mountain Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telluride.com/gondola |title=Gondola |website=Telluride.com |access-date=2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Galloping Goose loops around every 20 minutes from 7 am to 9 pm. It stops at major locations such as the Gondola, the Post Office, and the Courthouse.

Telluride's free Gondola is the only one of its kind in North America. It stops at three stations: Telluride, San Sophia, and Mountain Village. It is a 13-minute ride and reaches an elevation of 10,540 feet at the San Sophia station.[16] The gondola cabins feature bike and ski racks for recreational use. There are also pet-friendly and handicap accessible cabins available. The Gondola is open from 6:30 am to midnight during summer and winter season. It closes for six weeks during the off-season. 

Regional bus service is provided by the San Miguel Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART).

Telluride is part of Colorado's [[Bustang]] network. It is on the Durango-Grand Junction Outrider line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bustang Schedule |url=https://ridebustang.com/schedules/ |website=RideBustang |publisher=CDOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Major highways
*[[File:Colorado 145.svg|25px]] '''[[Colorado State Highway 145|State Highway 145]]''' is part of the [[San Juan Skyway]]. It connects Telluride to [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]] and [[Naturita, Colorado|Naturita]]. This road also gives access to [[Colorado State Highway 62|State Highway 62]], the main route to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]] and other important places in [[Colorado]].

;Mountain passes
There are two alternate passes to enter the town: [[Imogene Pass]] and [[Black Bear Road|Black Bear Pass]] (both require high clearance or four-wheel-drive vehicles).

==In popular culture==

The movie ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' by [[Quentin Tarantino]] conducted its [[principal photography]] on December 8, 2014, in Colorado on the Schmid Ranch near Telluride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quentin Tarantino Starts Shooting 'Hateful Eight'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/quentin-tarantino-starts-shooting-hateful-eight-1201413017/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Kia Telluride]]'' is named after the town.

'''Ukiyo-e'''{{efn|The obsolete transliteration ''ukiyo-ye'' appears in older texts.}} is a genre of [[Japanese art]] which flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries. Its artists produced [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] and [[Nikuhitsu-ga|paintings]] of such subjects as female beauties; [[kabuki]] actors and [[sumo]] wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; [[Flora of Japan|flora]] and [[Wildlife of Japan#Fauna|fauna]]; and [[Shunga|erotica]].  The term ''ukiyo-e'' ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:浮世絵#Japanese|浮世絵]]}}) translates as &quot;picture[s] of the floating world&quot;.

[[Edo]] (modern Tokyo) became the seat of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in the early 17th century. The merchant class at the bottom of [[Four occupations|the social order]], which benefited the most from city's rapid economic growth, began to indulge in the entertainments of kabuki theatre, [[geisha]], and [[oiran|courtesans]] of the [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]]; the term ''[[ukiyo]]'' (&quot;floating world&quot;) came to describe this hedonistic lifestyle.  Printed or painted ''ukiyo-e'' works emerged in the late 17th century and were popular with the merchant class, who had become wealthy enough to afford to decorate their homes with them.

The earliest ''ukiyo-e'' works emerged in the 1670s with [[Hishikawa Moronobu|Moronobu]]'s paintings and monochromatic prints of beautiful women.  [[Colour printing|Colour in prints]] came gradually—at first only added by hand for special commissions.  By the 1740s, artists such as [[Okumura Masanobu|Masanobu]] used multiple woodblocks to print areas of colour. In the 1760s, the success of [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]]'s [[nishiki-e|&quot;brocade prints&quot;]] led to full-colour production becoming standard, with ten or more blocks used to create each print.  Specialists have prized the portraits of beauties and actors by masters such as [[Torii Kiyonaga|Kiyonaga]], [[Utamaro]], and [[Sharaku]] that came in the late 18th century.  In the 19th century followed a pair of masters best remembered for their landscapes: the bold formalist [[Hokusai]], whose ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa|Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' is one of the best-known works of Japanese art; and the serene, atmospheric [[Hiroshige]], most noted for his series ''[[The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō]]''.  Following the deaths of these two masters, and against the technological and social modernization that followed the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, ukiyo-e production went into steep decline.

Some ukiyo-e artists specialized in making paintings, but most works were prints.  Artists rarely carved their own woodblocks for printing; rather, production was divided between the artist, who designed the prints; the carver, who cut the woodblocks; the printer, who inked and pressed the woodblocks onto [[Washi|hand-made paper]]; and the publisher, who financed, promoted, and distributed the works.  As printing was done by hand, printers were able to achieve effects impractical with machines, such as the [[Bokashi (printing)|blending or gradation of colours]] on the printing block.

Ukiyo-e was central to forming the West's perception of [[Japanese art]] in the late 19th century–especially the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige.  From the 1870s [[Japonism]] became a prominent trend and had a strong influence on the early [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] such as [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], and [[Claude Monet|Monet]], as well as [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]] such as [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]] and [[Art Nouveau]] artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]].  The 20th century saw a revival in Japanese printmaking: the ''[[shin-hanga]]'' (&quot;new prints&quot;) genre capitalized on Western interest in prints of traditional Japanese scenes, and the ''[[sōsaku-hanga]]'' (&quot;creative prints&quot;) movement promoted individualist works designed, carved, and printed by a single artist.  Prints since the late 20th century have continued in an individualist vein, often made with techniques imported from the West.

==History==

===Pre-history===

Japanese art since the [[Heian period]] (794–1185) had followed two principal paths: the indigenous ''{{transl|ja|[[Yamato-e]]}}'' tradition, focusing on Japanese themes, best known by the works of the [[Tosa school]]; and Chinese-inspired ''{{transl|ja|kara-e}}'' in a variety of styles, such as the monochromatic [[ink wash painting]] of [[Sesshū Tōyō]] and his disciples.  The [[Kanō school]] of painting incorporated features of both.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=8–9}}

Since antiquity, Japanese art had found patrons in the aristocracy, military governments, and religious authorities.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=66}}  Until the 16th century, the lives of the common people had not been a main subject of painting, and even when they were included, the works were luxury items made for the ruling samurai and rich merchant classes.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=66–67}}  Later works appeared by and for townspeople, including inexpensive monochromatic paintings of female beauties and scenes of the theatre and [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]].  The hand-produced nature of these ''{{transl|ja|shikomi-e}}''{{efn|{{lang|ja|仕込絵}} ''{{transl|ja|shikomi-e}}''}} limited the scale of their production, a limit that was soon overcome by genres that turned to mass-produced [[woodblock printing]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=67–68}}

[[File:Kano Hideyori - Maple Viewers - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3|alt=A painted screen of six panels depicting a park-like setting in which visitors enjoy the scenery|''Maple Viewing at Takao'' (mid-16th century) by [[Kanō Hideyori]] is one of the earliest Japanese paintings to feature the lives of the common people.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=66}}]]

During a [[Sengoku period|prolonged period of civil war]] in the 16th century, a class of politically powerful merchants had developed.  These {{illm|Machishū|ja|町衆|lt=''{{transl|ja|machishū}}''}} allied themselves with the court and had power over local communities; their patronage of the arts encouraged a revival in the classical arts in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.{{sfn|Kita|1984|pp=252–253}}  In the early 17th century [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] (1543–1616) unified the country and was appointed ''[[shōgun]]'' with supreme power over Japan.  He consolidated [[Tokugawa shogunate|his government]] in the village of [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo),{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}} and required the [[Daimyō|territorial lords]] to [[Sankin-kōtai|assemble there in alternate years]] with their entourages.  The demands of the growing capital drew many male labourers from the country, so that males came to make up nearly seventy percent of the population.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=17}}  The village grew during the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867) from a population of 1800 to over a million in the 19th century.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}}

The centralized shogunate put an end to the power of the ''{{transl|ja|machishū}}'' and divided the population into [[Four occupations|four social classes]], with the ruling [[samurai]] class at the top and the merchant class at the bottom.  While deprived of their political influence,{{sfn|Kita|1984|pp=252–253}} those of the merchant class most benefited from the rapidly expanding economy of the Edo period,{{sfn|Singer|1986|p=66}} and their improved lot allowed for leisure that many sought in the pleasure districts—in particular [[Yoshiwara]] in Edo{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}}—and collecting artworks to decorate their homes, which in earlier times had been well beyond their financial means.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=6}}  The experience of the pleasure quarters was open to those of sufficient wealth, manners, and education.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=137}}

[[File:Tokugawa Ieyasu2.JPG|thumb|alt=Painting of a mediaeval Asian man seated and dressed in splendour|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] established his government in the early 17th century in Edo (modern Tokyo).&lt;br/&gt;''Portrait of Tokugawa Ieyasu'', [[Kanō school]] painting, [[Kanō Tan'yū]], 17th century]]

[[Woodblock printing in Japan]] traces back to the ''[[Hyakumantō Darani]]'' in 770&amp;nbsp;CE.  Until the 17th century such printing was reserved for Buddhist seals and images.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=68}}  [[Movable type]] appeared around 1600, but as the [[Japanese writing system]] required about 100,000 type pieces,&lt;!-- this doesn't mean 100,000 characters in the writing system---it means that certain characters were used multiple times on the same page, and therefore multiples of the characters had to be available to the printer --&gt; hand-carving text onto woodblocks was more efficient.  In [[Saga Domain]], calligrapher [[Hon'ami Kōetsu]] and publisher {{Interlanguage link multi|Suminokura Soan|ja|3=角倉素庵}} combined printed text and images in an adaptation of ''[[The Tales of Ise]]'' (1608) and other works of literature.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}  During the [[Kan'ei]] era (1624–1643) illustrated books of folk tales called ''{{transl|ja|tanrokubon}}'', or &quot;orange-green books&quot;, were the first books mass-produced using woodblock printing.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=68}}  Woodblock imagery continued to evolve as illustrations to the ''{{transl|ja|[[kanazōshi]]}}'' genre of tales of hedonistic urban life in the new capital.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=69}}  The rebuilding of Edo following the [[Great Fire of Meireki]] in 1657 occasioned a modernization of the city, and the publication of illustrated printed books flourished in the rapidly urbanizing environment.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=69–70}}

The term &quot;ukiyo&quot;,{{efn|{{nihongo||浮世|ukiyo}} &quot;floating world&quot;}} which can be translated as &quot;floating world&quot;, was [[Homophone|homophonous]] with an ancient Buddhist term signifying &quot;this world of sorrow and grief&quot;.{{efn|{{nihongo||憂き世|ukiyo}} &quot;world of sorrow&quot;}}  The newer term at times was used to mean &quot;erotic&quot; or &quot;stylish&quot;, among other meanings, and came to describe the hedonistic spirit of the time for the lower classes.  [[Asai Ryōi]] celebrated this spirit in the novel ''Ukiyo Monogatari'' (&quot;''Tales of the Floating World''&quot;, {{circa|1661}}):{{sfn|Hickman|1978|pp=5–6}}

{{quote
|text = &quot;living only for the moment, savouring the moon, the snow, the cherry blossoms, and the maple leaves, singing songs, drinking sake, and diverting oneself just in floating, unconcerned by the prospect of imminent poverty, buoyant and carefree, like a gourd carried along with the river current: this is what we call ''ukiyo''.&quot;}}

===Emergence of ukiyo-e (late 17th&amp;nbsp;– early 18th centuries)===

The earliest ukiyo-e artists came from the world of [[Japanese painting]].{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  Yamato-e painting of the 17th century had developed a style of outlined forms which allowed inks to be dripped on a wet surface and spread out towards the outlines—this outlining of forms was to become the dominant style of ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=155}}

[[File:Hikone Screen.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3|alt=A folding screen painted with Japanese figures at play against a gold background|The [[Hikone screen]] may be the oldest surviving ukiyo-e work, dating to {{circa|1624–44}}.]]

Around 1661, painted [[Kakemono|hanging scrolls]] known as ''Portraits of Kanbun Beauties'' gained popularity.  The paintings of the [[Kanbun (era)|Kanbun era]] (1661–73), most of which are anonymous, marked the beginnings of ukiyo-e as an independent school.{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  The paintings of [[Iwasa Matabei]] (1578–1650) have a great affinity with ukiyo-e paintings.  Scholars disagree whether Matabei's work itself is ukiyo-e;{{sfn|Kita|1999|p=39}} assertions that he was the genre's founder are especially common amongst Japanese researchers.{{sfn|Kita|2011|pp=149, 154–155}}  At times Matabei has been credited as the artist of the unsigned [[Hikone screen]],{{sfn|Kita|1999|pp=44–45}} a ''{{transl|ja|[[byōbu]]}}'' folding screen that may be one of the earliest surviving ukiyo-e works.  The screen is in a refined Kanō style and depicts contemporary life, rather than the prescribed subjects of the painterly schools.{{sfn|Yashiro|1958|pp=216, 218}}

[[File:Moronobu b-w shunga.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A black-and-white illustration of a pair of lovers in splendid dress at play|Early woodblock print, [[Hishikawa Moronobu]], late 1670s or early 1680s]]&lt;!-- there is a really nice coloured version of this print on Commons.  Please don't replace this one with it, as there are few monochrome prints in the article. --&gt;

In response to the increasing demand for ukiyo-e works, [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] (1618–1694) produced the first ukiyo-e woodblock prints.{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  By 1672, Moronobu's success was such that he began to sign his work—the first of the book illustrators to do so.  He was a prolific illustrator who worked in a wide variety of genres, and developed an influential style of portraying female beauties.  Most significantly, he began to produce illustrations, not just for books, but as single-sheet images, which could stand alone or be used as part of a series.  The Hishikawa school attracted a large number of followers,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=70–71}} as well as imitators such as [[Sugimura Jihei]],{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=71–72}} and signalled the beginning of the popularization of a new artform.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=71}}

[[Torii Kiyonobu&amp;nbsp;I]] and [[Kaigetsudō Ando]] became prominent emulators of Moronobu's style following the master's death, though neither was a member of the Hishikawa school.  Both discarded background detail in favour of focus on the human figure—[[kabuki]] actors in the ''[[yakusha-e]]'' of Kiyonobu and the [[Torii school]] that followed him,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=72–73}} and courtesans in the ''[[bijin-ga]]'' of Ando and his [[Kaigetsudō school]].  Ando and his followers produced a stereotyped female image whose design and pose lent itself to effective mass production,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=72–74}} and its popularity created a demand for paintings that other artists and schools took advantage of.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=75–76}}  The Kaigetsudō school and its popular &quot;Kaigetsudō beauty&quot; ended after Ando's exile over his role in the [[Ejima-Ikushima affair|Ejima-Ikushima scandal]] of 1714.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=74–75}}

Kyoto native [[Nishikawa Sukenobu]] (1671–1750) painted technically refined pictures of courtesans.{{sfn|Noma|1966|p=188}}  Considered a master of erotic portraits, he was the subject of a government ban in 1722, though it is believed he continued to create works that circulated under different names.{{sfn|Hibbett|2001|p=69}}  Sukenobu spent most of his career in Edo, and his influence was considerable in both the [[Kantō region|Kantō]] and [[Kansai region]]s.{{sfn|Noma|1966|p=188}}  The paintings of [[Miyagawa Chōshun]] (1683–1752) portrayed early 18th-century life in delicate colours.  Chōshun made no prints.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=154}}  The [[Miyagawa school]] he founded in the early-18th century specialized in romantic paintings in a style more refined in line and colour than the Kaigetsudō school.  Chōshun allowed greater expressive freedom in his adherents, a group that later included [[Hokusai]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=75–76}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Colour prints (mid-18th century)===

Even in the earliest monochromatic prints and books, colour was added by hand for special commissions.  Demand for colour in the early-18th century was met with ''tan-e''{{efn|{{nihongo||丹|tan}}: a pigment made from red lead mixed with sulphur and [[Niter|saltpetre]]{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=76}} }} prints hand-tinted with orange and sometimes green or yellow.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=76–77}}  These were followed in the 1720s with a vogue for pink-tinted ''beni-e''{{efn|{{Nihongo||紅|beni}}: a pigment produced from [[safflower]] petals.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}} }} and later the lacquer-like ink of the ''[[urushi-e]]''.  In 1744, the ''[[benizuri-e]]'' were the first successes in colour printing, using multiple woodblocks—one for each colour, the earliest ''beni'' pink and vegetable green.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}}

[[File:Okumura Masanobu - Taking the Evening Cool by Ryōgoku Bridge.png|thumb|left|Western-style [[perspective (graphical)|graphical perspective]] and increased use of printed colour were amongst the innovations [[Okumura Masanobu]] claimed.&lt;br/&gt;''Taking the Evening Cool by Ryōgoku Bridge'', {{circa|1745}}]]

A great self-promoter, [[Okumura Masanobu]] (1686–1764) played a major role during the period of rapid technical development in printing from the late 17th to mid-18th centuries.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}}  He established a shop in 1707{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=16}} and combined elements of the leading contemporary schools in a wide array of genres, though Masanobu himself belonged to no school.  Amongst the innovations in his romantic, lyrical images were the introduction of [[geometrical perspective]] in the ''[[uki-e]]'' genre{{efn|Torii Kiyotada is said to have made the first ''uki-e'';{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}} Masanobu advertised himself as its innovator.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=78}}&lt;br /&gt;''A Layman's Explanation of the Rules of Drawing with a Compass and Ruler'' introduced Western-style geometrical perspective drawing to Japan in the 1734, based on a Dutch text of 1644 (see [[Rangaku]], &quot;Dutch learning&quot; during the Edo period); Chinese texts on the subject also appeared during the decade.{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}}&lt;br /&gt;Okumura likely learned about geometrical perspective from Chinese sources, some of which bear a striking resemblance to Okumura's works.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=64–68}} }} in the 1740s;{{sfn|Suwa|1998|p=64}} the long, narrow ''[[hashira-e]]'' prints; and the combination of graphics and literature in prints that included self-penned [[haiku]] poetry.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=77–79}}

Ukiyo-e reached a peak in the late 18th century with the advent of full-colour prints, developed after Edo returned to prosperity under [[Tanuma Okitsugu]] following a long depression.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=80–81}}  These popular colour prints came to be called ''[[nishiki-e]]'', or &quot;brocade pictures&quot;, as their brilliant colours seemed to bear resemblance to imported Chinese Shuchiang [[brocade]]s, known in Japanese as ''Shokkō nishiki''.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=82}}  The first to emerge were expensive calendar prints, printed with multiple blocks on very fine&lt;!---or finer than standard--&gt; paper with heavy, opaque inks.  These prints had the number of days for each month hidden in the design, and were sent at the New Year{{efn|Until 1873 the [[Japanese calendar]] was [[Lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], and each year the [[Japanese New Year]] fell on different days of the [[Gregorian calendar]]'s January or February.}} as personalized greetings, bearing the name of the patron rather than the artist.  The blocks for these prints were later re-used for commercial production, obliterating the patron's name and replacing it with that of the artist.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=150, 152}}

The delicate, romantic prints of [[Suzuki Harunobu]] (1725–1770) were amongst the first to realize expressive and complex colour designs,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=81}} printed with up to a dozen separate blocks to handle the different colours{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=89}} and half-tones.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=155}}  His restrained, graceful prints invoked the classicism of [[waka (poetry)|waka]] poetry and [[Yamato-e]] painting.  The prolific Harunobu was the dominant ukiyo-e artist of his time.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=82–83}}  The success of Harunobu's colourful ''nishiki-e'' from 1765 on led to a steep decline in demand for the limited palettes of ''benizuri-e'' and ''urushi-e'', as well as hand-coloured prints.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=89}}

A trend against the idealism of the prints of Harunobu and the Torii school grew following Harunobu's death in 1770.  [[Katsukawa Shunshō]] (1726–1793) and [[Katsukawa school|his school]] produced portraits of kabuki actors with greater fidelity to the actors' actual features than had been the trend.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=83}}  Sometime-collaborators [[Koryūsai]] (1735&amp;nbsp;– {{circa|1790}}) and [[Kitao Shigemasa]] (1739–1820) were prominent depicters of women who also moved ukiyo-e away from the dominance of Harunobu's idealism by focusing on contemporary urban fashions and celebrated real-world courtesans and [[geisha]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=84–85}}  Koryūsai was perhaps the most prolific ukiyo-e artist of the 18th century, and produced a larger number of paintings and print series than any predecessor.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|p=3}}  The [[Kitao school]] that Shigemasa founded was one of the dominant schools of the closing decades of the 18th century.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}}

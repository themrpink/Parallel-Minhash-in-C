==Open and closed classes==
{{See also|Function word|Content word}}

Word classes may be either open or closed. An '''open class''' is one that commonly accepts the addition of new words, while a '''closed class''' is one to which new items are very rarely added. Open classes normally contain large numbers of words, while closed classes are much smaller. Typical open classes found in English and many other languages are [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s (excluding [[auxiliary verbs]], if these are regarded as a separate class), [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s and [[interjection]]s. [[Ideophone]]s are often an open class, though less familiar to English speakers,&lt;ref name=&quot;guide99&quot;&gt;''The Art of Grammar: A Practical Guide,'' Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFBVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Tucker Childs, &quot;African ideophones&quot;, in ''Sound Symbolism,''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uov84NavOR8C&amp;pg=PA179 p. 179]&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=ideophones|1=Ideophones do not always form a single grammatical word class, and their classification varies between languages, sometimes being split across other word classes. Rather, they are a phonosemantic word class, based on derivation, but may be considered part of the category of &quot;expressives&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;guide99&quot;/&gt; which thus often form an open class due to the productivity of ideophones. Further, &quot;[i]n the vast majority of cases, however, ideophones perform an adverbial function and are closely linked with verbs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;G. Tucker Childs, &quot;African ideophones&quot;, in ''Sound Symbolism,''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uov84NavOR8C&amp;pg=PA181 p. 181]&lt;/ref&gt;}} and are often open to [[nonce word]]s. Typical closed classes are [[preposition]]s (or postpositions), [[determiner]]s, [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]s, and [[pronoun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strazny.com/encyclopedia/sample-function-words.html|title=Sample Entry: Function Words / Encyclopedia of Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The open–closed distinction is related to the distinction between [[syntactic category|lexical and functional categories]], and to that between [[content word]]s and [[function word]]s, and some authors consider these identical, but the connection is not strict. Open classes are generally lexical categories in the stricter sense, containing words with greater semantic content,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lexical and Functional categories&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-0-470-65531-3|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; while closed classes are normally functional categories, consisting of words that perform essentially grammatical functions. This is not universal: in many languages verbs and adjectives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1075/sl.1.1.04dix| title = Where Have all the Adjectives Gone?| journal = Studies in Language| volume = 1| pages = 19–80| year = 1977| last = Dixon | first = Robert M.

Aikhenvald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFBVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt; are closed classes, usually consisting of few members, and in Japanese the formation of new pronouns from existing nouns is relatively common, though to what extent these form a distinct word class is debated.

Words are added to open classes through such processes as [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]], [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], [[Coining (linguistics)|coining]], and [[Borrowing (linguistics)|borrowing]]. When a new word is added through some such process, it can subsequently be used grammatically in sentences in the same ways as other words in its class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoff|first=Erika|title=Language Development|year=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-133-93909-2|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closed class may obtain new items through these same processes, but such changes are much rarer and take much more time. A closed class is normally seen as part of the core language and is not expected to change. In English, for example, new nouns, verbs, etc. are being added to the language constantly (including by the common process of [[verbing]] and other types of [[conversion (word formation)|conversion]], where an existing word comes to be used in a different part of speech). However, it is very unusual for a new pronoun, for example, to become accepted in the language, even in cases where there may be felt to be a need for one, as in the case of [[Gender-neutral pronoun#English|gender-neutral pronouns]].

The open or closed status of word classes varies between languages, even assuming that corresponding word classes exist. Most conspicuously, in many languages verbs and adjectives form closed classes of content words. An extreme example is found in [[Jingulu language|Jingulu]], which has only three verbs, while even the modern Indo-European [[Persian language|Persian]] has no more than a few hundred simple verbs, a great deal of which are archaic. (Some twenty Persian verbs are used as [[light verb]]s to form compounds; this lack of lexical verbs is shared with other Iranian languages.) Japanese is similar, having few lexical verbs.&lt;ref&gt;''Categorial Features: A Generative Theory of Word Class Categories,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=QoNIBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54 p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basque verbs]] are also a closed class, with the vast majority of verbal senses instead expressed periphrastically.

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], verbs and adjectives are closed classes,{{sfn|Dixon|1977|p=48}} though these are quite large, with about 700 adjectives,&lt;ref&gt;''The Typology of Adjectival Predication,'' Harrie Wetzer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ORUUwhdDPpUC&amp;pg=PA311 p. 311]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guide96&quot;&gt;''The Art of Grammar: A Practical Guide,'' Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFBVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96]&lt;/ref&gt; and verbs have opened slightly in recent years. [[Japanese adjectives]] are closely related to verbs (they can predicate a sentence, for instance). New verbal meanings are nearly always expressed periphrastically by appending {{Nihongo||する|suru|to do}} to a noun, as in {{Nihongo||運動する|undō suru|to (do) exercise}}, and new adjectival meanings are nearly always expressed by [[adjectival noun (Japanese)|adjectival noun]]s, using the suffix {{Nihongo||〜な|-na}} when an adjectival noun modifies a noun phrase, as in {{Nihongo||変なおじさん|hen-na ojisan|strange {{not a typo|man}}&lt;!-- do NOT translate this a &quot;uncle&quot; --&gt;}}. The closedness of verbs has weakened in recent years, and in a few cases new verbs are created by appending {{Nihongo||〜る|-ru}} to a noun or using it to replace the end of a word. This is mostly in casual speech for borrowed words, with the most well-established example being {{Nihongo||サボる|sabo-ru|cut class; play hooky}}, from {{Nihongo||サボタージュ|sabotāju|sabotage}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japaneselevelup.com/homage-to-るru-the-magical-verbifier/ |title=Homage to る(ru), The Magical Verbifier |date= 2011-07-18 |author=[http://japaneselevelup.com/author/adshap8/ Adam]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recent innovation aside, the huge contribution of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]] was almost entirely borrowed as nouns (often verbal nouns or adjectival nouns). Other languages where adjectives are closed class include Swahili,&lt;ref name=&quot;guide97&quot;/&gt; [[Bemba language|Bemba]], and [[Luganda]].

By contrast, [[Japanese pronouns]] are an open class and nouns become used as pronouns with some frequency; a recent example {{Nihongo||自分|jibun|self}}, now used by some young men as a first-person pronoun. The status of Japanese pronouns as a distinct class is disputed{{By whom|date=December 2018}}, however, with some considering it only a use of nouns, not a distinct class. The case is similar in languages of Southeast Asia, including Thai and Lao, in which, like Japanese, pronouns and terms of address vary significantly based on relative social standing and respect.&lt;ref name=&quot;guide98&quot;&gt;''The Art of Grammar: A Practical Guide,'' Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFBVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 p. 98]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some word classes are universally closed, however, including demonstratives and interrogative words.&lt;ref name=&quot;guide98&quot;/&gt;

'''''From Hell''''' is a [[graphic novel]] by writer [[Alan Moore]] and artist [[Eddie Campbell]], originally published in serial form from 1989 to 1998. The full collection was published in 1999 by Top Shelf Productions.

Set during the [[Whitechapel murders]] of the late [[Victorian era]], the novel speculates upon the identity and motives of [[Jack the Ripper]]. The novel depicts several true events surrounding the murders, although portions have been fictionalised, particularly the identity of the killer and the precise nature and circumstances of the murders. 

The title is taken from the first words of the [[From Hell letter|&quot;From Hell&quot; letter]], which some authorities believe was an authentic message sent from the killer in 1888. The collected edition is 572 pages long. The 2000 and later editions are the most common prints. The comic was loosely adapted into a [[From Hell (film)|film]], released in 2001. In 2000, the graphic novel was banned in Australia for several weeks after customs officers seized copies of the seventh issue from a shipment intended for Quality Comics.

==Publication history==
''From Hell'' was originally serialized as one of several features in ''[[Taboo (comic)|Taboo]]'', an anthology comic book published by [[Stephen R. Bissette|Steve Bissette's]] Spiderbaby Grafix. After running in ''Taboo'' #2–7 (1989–1992), Moore and Campbell moved the project to its own series, published first by [[Tundra Publishing]], then by [[Kitchen Sink Press]]. The series was published in ten volumes between 1991 and 1996, and an appendix, ''From Hell: The Dance of the Gull-catchers'', was published in 1998.  The entire series was collected in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] and published by Eddie Campbell Comics in 1999; trade paperback and hardcover versions are now published by [[Top Shelf Productions]] in the United States and [[Knockabout Comics]] in the UK. A fully colorized Master Edition was serialized starting in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Holub, Christian (May 31, 2018). [https://ew.com/books/2018/05/31/eddie-campbell-from-hell-color/ &quot;Eddie Campbell explains why he's coloring ''From Hell'' for the first time&quot;]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''From Hell'' takes as its premise [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]'s theory that the Jack the Ripper murders were part of a [[Jack the Ripper conspiracy theories|conspiracy]] to conceal the birth of an illegitimate [[British monarchy|royal]] baby fathered by [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence]], slightly modified: the involvement of [[Walter Sickert]] is reduced, and Knight's allegation that the child's mother was a Catholic has been dropped. Knight's theories have been described as &quot;a good fictional read&quot; whose &quot;conclusions have been disproved numerous times&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://casebook.org/ripper_media/book_reviews/non-fiction/finalsol.html &quot;Jack The Ripper: The Final Solution&quot;]. Casebook: Jack the Ripper. Retrieved September 25, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; In an appendix added to the collected ''From Hell'', Moore writes that he did not accept Knight's theory at face value (echoing the then-growing consensus that such claims were likely hoaxes), but considered it an interesting starting point for his own fictional examination of the Ripper murders, their era and impact. However, in the serialised publication of ''Dance of the Gull-Catchers'' Moore included an &quot;author's statement&quot; which consisted of a blown-up panel from the prologue, depicting the psychic [[Robert James Lees]] confessing that although his visions were fraudulent, they were accurate: &quot;I made it all up, and it all came true anyway. That's the funny part.&quot;{{fact|date=September 2019}}

Moore and Campbell conducted significant research to ensure plausibility and [[verisimilitude]]. The collected ''From Hell'' features over forty pages of page-by-page notes and references, indicating which scenes are based wholly on Moore's own imagination and which are based upon specific named sources. Moore's opinions on the reliability of those references are also indicated. The annotations are followed by an epilogue in comics format, ''The Dance of the Gull-Catchers'', in which Moore and Campbell expand on the various theories of the Ripper crimes and the likelihood—or rather, the near-impossibility—of the true identity of the culprit ever being established.{{fact|date=September 2019}}

==Plot==
[[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence]], also known as Prince Eddy, marries and fathers a child with Annie Crook, a shop girl in London's [[East End]]. Prince Eddy had visited the area under an assumed name and Annie is unaware of her husband's royal position. [[Queen Victoria]] becomes aware of the marriage and has Albert separated forcibly from his wife, whom she places in an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]]. Victoria then instructs her royal physician Sir [[William Gull]] to impair Annie's sanity, which he does by damaging or impairing her [[thyroid gland]]. The prince's daughter is taken to Annie's parents by the artist [[Walter Sickert]], a friend of Eddy's who had accompanied him on his trips to the East End. Annie's father believes the child to be his through an [[incest|incestuous]] relationship with his daughter. Sickert reluctantly leaves the child with Annie's parents.

The potentially scandalous matter is resolved, until a group of prostitutes — Annie's friends [[Mary Jane Kelly|Mary Kelly]], [[Polly Nichols]], [[Annie Chapman|Anne Chapman]], and [[Liz Stride]] — who are aware of the illegitimate child and its royal connections, attempt to [[blackmail]] Sickert to pay off a gang of thugs who are threatening them. After Queen Victoria learns of the blackmail attempt, Gull is once again enlisted, this time to silence the group of women who are threatening the crown. The police are complicit in the crimes&amp;nbsp;— they are granted prior knowledge of Gull's intentions, and are adjured not to interfere until the plot is completed.

Gull, a high-ranking [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], begins a campaign of violence against the four women in [[Whitechapel]], brutally murdering them with the aid of a carriage driver, [[John Netley]]. While he justifies the murders by claiming they are a Masonic warning to an apparent [[Illuminati]] threat to the throne, the killings are, in Gull's mind, part of an elaborate mystical ritual to ensure male societal dominance over women. While targeting Kelly, Gull also kills [[Catherine Eddowes]], who was using Kelly's name as an alias. As the killings progress, Gull becomes more and more psychologically unhinged, until he finally has a full psychic vision of the future while murdering a woman he believes to be Kelly.

The story also serves as an in-depth character study of Gull; exploring his personal philosophy and motivation, and making sense of his dual role as royal assassin and [[serial killer]]. Though rooted in factual biographical details of Gull's life, Moore admitted taking substantial fictional license: for example, the real-life Gull suffered a stroke; Moore fictionalises this event as a [[theophany]], with Gull seeing &quot;[[Jahbulon]]&quot;, a Masonic figure, fundamentally altering Gull's [[world view]] and indirectly leading to the murders.

Gull takes Netley on a tour of London landmarks (including [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]'s churches), expounding on their hidden mystical significance, which is lost to the modern world. Later, Gull forces the semi-literate Netley to write the infamous [[From Hell letter]] which lends the work its title. Following this, several people write letters to the police claiming to be the murderer, and the nickname &quot;[[Jack the Ripper]]&quot; becomes a household name. Gull has a number of [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] experiences in the course of the murders, culminating with a vivid vision of what London will be like a century after the last murder. It is implied that, through his grisly activities, male dominance over femininity is assured, and the 20th century is thus given its dominant form, though Gull finds it disgusting nevertheless.

Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], who once patrolled Whitechapel as a police officer, investigates the Ripper crimes without success. He meets [[Robert James Lees]],  a fraudulent psychic who acts as a spiritual advisor to Queen Victoria. Lees, acting on a personal grudge, contacts Abberline and identifies Gull as the murderer. Abberline and Lees confront Gull, who instantly confesses. Abberline reports the confession to his superiors at [[Scotland Yard]], who cover up the discovery. The police inform both Abberline and Lees that Gull was operating alone, and was gripped by insanity. Abberline later discovers through chance Gull's actual intentions to cover up the matter of the royal &quot;[[Illegitimacy|bastard]]&quot; fathered by the Duke of Clarence. He resigns from the [[Metropolitan Police]] in protest of the official cover-up of the murders, and contemplates leaving England to join the [[Pinkertons]].

Gull is tried by a secret Masonic council, which determines he is insane. Gull refuses to submit to the council, informing them that because of his accomplishments and his visions, no man amongst them may be counted as his peer and cannot judge the &quot;mighty work&quot; he has wrought. A phony funeral is staged, and Gull is imprisoned under a pseudonym &quot;Thomas Mason.&quot; The Freemasons frame boarding school teacher [[Montague Druitt]] as a suspect, killing him and making his death look like suicide. Years later, and moments before his death, Gull has an extended mystical experience, where his spirit [[time travel|travels through time]], observing the crimes of the [[London Monster]], instigating or inspiring a number of other killers ([[Peter Sutcliffe]], [[Moors murders|Ian Brady]]), causing Netley's death, as well as serving as the inspiration for both [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' and [[William Blake]]'s painting &quot;[[The Ghost of a Flea]]&quot;. The last experience his spirit undergoes before it &quot;becomes God&quot; is visiting a woman living in [[Ireland]] who, in the novel's appendices, is implied to be Mary Kelly. The woman has four children who are named after the women murdered by Gull in Whitechapel. She is apparently able to see Gull's spirit, and abjures him to begone &quot;back to Hell.&quot;

==Interpretations and themes==
''From Hell'' was partly inspired by the title of [[Douglas Adams]]' novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'', in that it explores the notion that to solve a crime [[holism|holistically]], one would need to solve the entire society in which it occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Windett, Jenni Scott &amp; Guy Lawley, &quot;Writer From Hell: the Alan Moore Experience&quot; (interview), ''Comics Forum'' 4, p. 46, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; 

''From Hell'' also explores Moore's ideas on the nature of time. Early on, Gull's friend [[James Hinton (surgeon)|James Hinton]] discusses his son [[Charles Howard Hinton|Howard]]'s theory of the &quot;fourth dimension&quot;, which proposes that time is a spatial dimension. All time co-exists, and it is only the limits of our perception that make it appear to progress. Sequences of related events can be seen as shapes in the fourth dimension: history can &quot;be said to have an architecture&quot;, as Gull puts it.&lt;ref&gt;Moore &amp; Campbell, ''From Hell'' chapter 2, page 15, panel 4&lt;/ref&gt; Gull's experiences seem to confirm this: he has visions of the 20th century during the murders, and as he is dying he experiences, and appears to influence, past and future events. Moore had earlier explored similar ideas in ''[[Watchmen]]'', where [[Doctor Manhattan]] perceives past, present and future simultaneously, and describes himself as &quot;a puppet who can see the strings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Moore &amp; Dave Gibbons, ''Watchmen'' issue 9, page 5, panel 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Gary Groth]] says the most elaborate theme in ''From Hell'' stems from Moore's statement that &quot;the Ripper murders&amp;nbsp;— happening when they did and where they did&amp;nbsp;— were almost like an apocalyptic summary of... that entire Victorian age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Groth, Gary]] (February 1991). &quot;Last Big Words&amp;nbsp;— Alan Moore on 'Marvelman', 'From Hell', 'A Small Killing,' and being published.&quot; ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, they prefigure a lot of the horrors of the 20th century.&quot; In Moore's reading of the works of contemporary artists including [[Émile Zola]] and the [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionist]] painters, the prostitute had become an icon of the working lives of the impoverished and disenfranchised. He notes that the 1880s saw the [[Mahdi]] uprisings, the first time the Western world had to face militant [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; physicists were beginning to make discoveries that would pave the way to the [[atomic bomb]]; and the growth of both [[Zionism]] and [[anti-Semitism]]. The period of the killings coincides with the conception of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the final scene alludes to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. After the final murder, during which Gull has an extended vision of 1990s England, Gull says, &quot;It is beginning, Netley. Only just beginning. For better or worse, the twentieth century. I have delivered it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Campbell, ''From Hell'' chapter 10, page 33, panel 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
''From Hell'' won several [[Eisner Awards]], including &quot;Best Serialized Story&quot; (1993),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner93.php 1993 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners], Comic Book Awards Almanac&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Best Writer&quot; (1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner95.php 1995 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners], Comic Book Awards Almanac&lt;/ref&gt; 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner96.php 1996 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners], Comic Book Awards Almanac&lt;/ref&gt; 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner97.php 1997 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners], Comic Book Awards Almanac&lt;/ref&gt;), and &quot;Best Graphic Album – Reprint&quot; (2000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner00.php 2000 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners], Comic Book Awards Almanac&lt;/ref&gt; It won the 1995 [[Harvey Award]] for Best Continuing or Limited Series, and the collected edition won the 2000 Harvey Award for Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work.

The book also won the 2000 [[Eagle Award (comics)|Eagle Award]] for Favourite Trade Paperback/Reprint Collection,&lt;ref name=Tart&gt;[http://www.sequentialtart.com/award.php &quot;Eagle Awards 2000: Sequential Tart Wins!&quot;], ''Sequential Tart''. Accessed Jan. 15, 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;[[Prix de la critique]]&quot; at the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]] in 2001, for the French edition published by [[Delcourt (publisher)|Éditions Delcourt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acbd.fr/919/grands-prix-de-la-critique/2001/ Prix de la Critique 2001], [[Association des Critiques et des journalistes de Bande Dessinée|ACBD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The collected edition was a top vote getter for the [[Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Award]] for Favorite Reprint Graphic Album in 1999.

During its initial serialization, ''From Hell'' received the 1996 [[International Horror Guild Award]] for Graphic Story/illustrated Narrative,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horroraward.org/prevrec.html#1995 IHG Award Recipients] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422073428/http://horroraward.org/prevrec.html#1995 |date=22 April 2009 }}, International Horror Guild.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1997 [[Ignatz Award]] for Outstanding Story.

In [[mathematics]], an '''abelian category''' is a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] in which [[morphism]]s and [[Object (category theory)|objects]] can be added and in which [[Kernel (category theory)|kernel]]s and [[cokernel]]s exist and have desirable properties. The motivating prototypical example of an abelian category is the [[category of abelian groups]], '''Ab'''. The theory originated in an effort to unify several [[Cohomology theory|cohomology theories]] by [[Alexander Grothendieck]] and independently in the slightly earlier work of [[David Buchsbaum]]. Abelian categories are very ''stable'' categories; for example they are [[regular category|regular]] and they satisfy the [[snake lemma]]. The [[Class (set theory)|class]] of abelian categories is closed under several categorical constructions, for example, the category of [[chain complex]]es of an abelian category, or the category of [[functor]]s from a [[small category]] to an abelian category are abelian as well. These stability properties make them inevitable in [[homological algebra]] and beyond; the theory has major applications in [[algebraic geometry]], [[cohomology]] and pure [[category theory]]. Abelian categories are named after [[Niels Henrik Abel]].

==Definitions==
A category is '''abelian''' if it is ''[[Preadditive category|preadditive]]'' and
*it has a [[zero object]],
*it has all binary [[biproduct]]s,
*it has all [[Kernel (category theory)|kernels]] and [[cokernel]]s, and
*all [[monomorphism]]s and [[epimorphism]]s are [[Normal morphism|normal]].

This definition is equivalent&lt;ref&gt;Peter Freyd, [http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/3/tr3abs.html Abelian Categories]&lt;/ref&gt; to the following &quot;piecemeal&quot; definition:
* A category is ''[[Preadditive category|preadditive]]'' if it is [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[monoidal category]] '''Ab''' of [[abelian group]]s. This means that all [[hom-set]]s are abelian groups and the composition of morphisms is [[bilinear operator|bilinear]]. 
* A preadditive category is ''[[Additive category|additive]]'' if every [[finite set]] of objects has a [[biproduct]]. This means that we can form finite [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]]s and [[direct product]]s. In &lt;ref&gt;Handbook of categorical algebra, vol. 2, F. Borceux&lt;/ref&gt; Def. 1.2.6, it is required that an additive category has a zero object (empty biproduct).
* An additive category is ''[[preabelian category|preabelian]]'' if every morphism has both a [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] and a [[cokernel]].
* Finally, a preabelian category is '''abelian''' if every [[monomorphism]] and every [[epimorphism]] is [[normal morphism|normal]]. This means that every monomorphism is a kernel of some morphism, and every epimorphism is a cokernel of some morphism.

Note that the enriched structure on [[hom-set]]s is a ''consequence'' of the first three [[axiom]]s of the first definition. This highlights the foundational relevance of the category of [[Abelian group]]s in the theory and its canonical nature.

The concept of [[exact sequence]] arises naturally in this setting, and it turns out that [[exact functor]]s, i.e. the functors preserving exact sequences in various senses, are the relevant functors between abelian categories. This ''exactness'' concept has been axiomatized in the theory of [[Exact category|exact categories]], forming a very special case of [[regular category|regular categories]].

==Examples==
* As mentioned above, the category of all abelian groups is an abelian category. The category of all [[finitely generated abelian group]]s is also an abelian category, as is the category of all finite abelian groups.
* If ''R'' is a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], then the category of all left (or right) [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over ''R'' is an abelian category. In fact, it can be shown that any small abelian category is equivalent to a [[full subcategory]] of such a category of modules (''[[Mitchell's embedding theorem]]'').
* If ''R'' is a left-[[noetherian ring]], then the category of [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] left modules over ''R'' is abelian. In particular, the category of finitely generated modules over a noetherian [[commutative ring]] is abelian; in this way, abelian categories show up in [[commutative algebra]].
* As special cases of the two previous examples: the category of [[vector space]]s over a fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' is abelian, as is the category of finite-[[Hamel dimension|dimensional]] vector spaces over ''k''.
* If ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then the category of all (real or complex) [[vector bundles]] on ''X'' is not usually an abelian category, as there can be monomorphisms that are not kernels.
* If ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then the category of all [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of abelian groups on ''X'' is an abelian category. More generally, the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck site]] is an abelian category. In this way, abelian categories show up in [[algebraic topology]] and [[algebraic geometry]].
* If '''C''' is a [[Category (mathematics)#Small and large categories|small category]] and '''A''' is an abelian category, then the [[functor category|category of all functors]] from '''C''' to '''A''' forms an abelian category. If '''C''' is small and [[preadditive category|preadditive]], then the category of all [[additive functor]]s from '''C''' to '''A''' also forms an abelian category. The latter is a generalization of the ''R''-module example, since a ring can be understood as a preadditive category with a single object.

==Grothendieck's axioms==
In his [[Tōhoku article]], Grothendieck listed four additional axioms (and their duals) that an abelian category '''A''' might satisfy. These axioms are still in common use to this day. They are the following:
* AB3) For every indexed family (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) of objects of '''A''', the [[coproduct]] *''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; exists in '''A''' (i.e. '''A''' is [[cocomplete]]).
* AB4) '''A''' satisfies AB3), and the coproduct of a family of monomorphisms is a monomorphism.
* AB5) '''A''' satisfies AB3), and [[filtered colimit]]s of [[exact sequence]]s are exact.
and their duals
* AB3*) For every indexed family (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) of objects of '''A''', the [[Product (category theory)|product]] P''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; exists in '''A''' (i.e. '''A''' is [[Complete category|complete]]).
* AB4*) '''A''' satisfies AB3*), and the product of a family of epimorphisms is an epimorphism.
* AB5*) '''A''' satisfies AB3*), and [[filtered limit]]s of exact sequences are exact.

Axioms AB1) and AB2) were also given. They are what make an additive category abelian. Specifically:
* AB1) Every morphism has a kernel and a cokernel.
* AB2) For every morphism ''f'', the canonical morphism from coim ''f'' to im ''f'' is an [[isomorphism]].

Grothendieck also gave axioms AB6) and AB6*).

* AB6) '''A''' satisfies AB3), and given a family of filtered categories &lt;math&gt;I_j, j\in J&lt;/math&gt; and maps &lt;math&gt;A_j : I_j \to A&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\prod_{j\in J} \lim_{I_j} A_j = \lim_{I_j, \forall j\in J} \prod_{j\in J} A_j&lt;/math&gt;, where lim denotes the filtered colimit.
* AB6*) '''A''' satisfies AB3*), and given a family of cofiltered categories &lt;math&gt;I_j, j\in J&lt;/math&gt; and maps &lt;math&gt;A_j : I_j \to A&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j\in J} \lim_{I_j} A_j = \lim_{I_j, \forall j\in J} \sum_{j\in J} A_j&lt;/math&gt;, where lim denotes the cofiltered limit.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In lust there is reliance upon the object of sense and consequent spiritual subordination of the soul to it, but love puts the soul into direct and co-ordinate relation with the reality which is behind the form. Therefore, lust is experienced as being heavy and love is experienced as being light. In lust there is a narrowing down of life and in love there is an expansion in being...If you love the whole world you vicariously live in the whole world, but in lust there is an ebbing down of life and a general sense of hopeless dependence upon a form which is regarded as another. Thus, in lust there is the accentuation of separateness and suffering, but in love there is the feeling of unity and joy....&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org/ ''Discourses'']. Volume I. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. pp. 159–160. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Paganism===
Few ancient, [[Paganism|pagan religions]] actually considered lust to be a vice.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} The most famous example of a widespread religious movement practicing lechery as a ritual is the [[Bacchanalia]] of the [[Ancient Roman]] [[Bacchantes]]. However, this activity was soon outlawed by the [[Roman Senate]] in 186 BC in the decree ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]''. The practice of sacred prostitution, however, continued to be an activity practiced often by the [[Dionysian]]s.

==In culture==

===Medieval prostitutes===
Medieval prostitutes lived officially sanctioned in &quot;red light districts&quot;. In Ruth Mazo Karras' book ''Common Women'', the author discusses the meaning of prostitution and how people thought the proper use of prostitutes by unmarried men helped contain male lust. Prostitution was thought of as having a beneficial effect by reducing the [[sexual frustration]] in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Karras, Ruth Mazo. ''Common Women: Prostitution and Sexuality in Medieval England''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
From [[Ovid]] to the works of ''[[poète maudit|les poètes maudits]]'', characters have always been faced with scenes of lechery, and long since has lust been a common motif in world literature. Many writers, such as [[Georges Bataille]], [[Casanova]] and [[Prosper Mérimée]], have written works wherein scenes take place at bordellos and other unseemly locales.

[[Baudelaire]], author of ''[[Les fleurs du mal]]'', had once remarked, in regard to the artist, that:

{{cquote|The more a man cultivates the arts, the less randy he becomes... Only the brute is good at coupling, and copulation is the lyricism of the masses. To copulate is to enter into another—and the artist never emerges from himself.}}

The most notable work to touch upon the sin of lust, and all of the Seven Deadly Sins, is Dante's ''[[la Divina Commedia]]''. Dante's criterion for lust was an &quot;excessive love of others&quot;, insofar as an excessive love for man would render one's love of God secondary.

In the first canticle of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'', the lustful are punished by being continuously swept around in a whirlwind, which symbolizes their passions. The damned who are guilty of lust, like the two famous lovers, Paolo and Francesca, receive what they desired in their mortal lives, their passions never give them rest for all eternity. In ''[[Purgatorio]]'', of the selfsame work, the penitents choose to walk through flames in order to purge themselves of their lustful inclinations.

==In philosophy==
The link between [[love]] and lust has always been a problematic question in philosophy.

===Schopenhauer===
[[Schopenhauer]] notes the misery which results from [[sexual relationship]]s. According to him, this directly explains the sentiments of shame and sadness which tend to follow the act of sexual intercourse; for, he states, the only power that reigns is the inextinguishable desire to face, at any price, the blind love present in human existence without any consideration of the outcome. He estimates that a genius of his species is an industrial being who wants only to produce, and wants only to think. The theme of lust for Schopenhauer is thus to consider the horrors which will almost certainly follow the culmination of lust.

===St Thomas Aquinas===
St Thomas Aquinas defines the sin of lust in questions 153 and 154 of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. Aquinas says the sin of lust is of &quot;voluptuous emotions&quot;, and makes the point that sexual pleasures, &quot;unloosen the human spirit&quot;, and set aside right reason (pg. 191). Aquinas restricts lust's subject matter to physical desires specifically arising from sexual acts, but he does not assume all sex-acts are sinful. Sex is not a sin in marriage, because sex is the only way for humans to reproduce. If sex is used naturally and the end purpose is reproduction there is no sin. Aquinas says, &quot;if the end be good and if what is done is well-adapted to that, then no sin is present&quot; (pg. 193). However, sex simply for the sake of pleasure is lustful, and therefore a sin. A man who uses his body for lechery wrongs the Lord.

Sex may have the attributes of being sinless; however, when a person seeks sex for pleasure, he or she is sinning with lust. Lust is best defined by its specific attribute of rape, adultery, wet dreams, seduction, unnatural vice, and simple fornication.

[[Wet dreams]]: St Thomas Aquinas defined and discussed the topic of nocturnal emission, which occurs when one dreams of physical pleasure. Aquinas argues those who say that wet dreams are a sin and comparable to the actual experience of sex are wrong. Aquinas believes that such an action is sinless, for a dream is not under a person's control or free judgment. When one has a &quot;nocturnal orgasm&quot;, it is not a sin, but it can lead to sins (pg. 227). Aquinas says that wet dreams come from a physical cause of inappropriate pictures within your imagination, a psychological cause when thinking of sex while you fall asleep and a demonical cause whereby demons act upon the sleeper's body, &quot;stirring the sleeper's imagination to bring about a orgasm&quot; (pg. 225). In the end, though, dreaming of lustful acts is not sinful. The &quot;mind's awareness is less hindered&quot;, as the sleeper lacks right reason; therefore, a person cannot be accountable for what they dream while sleeping (pg. 227).

[[Adultery]]: One of the main forms of lust seen frequently during the Middle Ages was the sin of adultery. The sin of adultery occurs when a person is unfaithful to his or her spouse, hence &quot;invading of a bed not one's own&quot; (pg. 235). Adultery is a special kind of ugliness and many difficulties arise from it. When a man enters the bed of a married woman it not only is a sin, but it &quot;wrongs the offspring&quot;, because the woman now calls into question the legitimacy of children (pg. 235). If a wife has committed adultery before, then, her husband will question if all his wife's children are his offspring. 
	
[[Fornication|Simple fornication]]: Simple fornication is having sex with one's wife for enjoyment rather than for bearing children. Fornication is also sex between two unmarried people, which is also a mortal sin. Aquinas says that &quot;fornication is a deadly crime&quot; (pg. 213). Fornication is a mortal sin, but as Aquinas notes, &quot;Pope Gregory treated sins of the flesh as less grievous than those of the spirit&quot; (pg. 217). Fornication was a grave sin such as that against property. Fornication, however, is not as grave as a sin directly against God and human life; therefore, murder is much worse than fornication. Property in this case means that a daughter is the property of her father, and if one does wrong to her, one then does wrong to him; therefore seducing a virgin or seeking pleasure from an unmarried woman is an invasion of a father's property.

[[Rape]]: Rape is a kind of lust that often coincides with seduction and is defined as a type of lechery. Rape comes with force and violence: Rape occurs when a person craves the pleasures of sex so intensely that he uses force to obtain it. Rape is committed when violence is used to seduce, or deflower a virgin. Rape harms both the unmarried girl and her father, because the girl is property of her father. Rape and seduction can be discussed together, because both sins involve the deflowering of a virgin; however, rape can happen without seduction, as when a man attacks a widow or a sexually experienced woman and violates her. Therefore, wherever violence accompanies sex, you have the quality of rape and the sin of lust.

[[Seduction]]: Seduction is a type of lust, because seduction is a sex act, which ravishes a virgin. Lust is a sin of sexual activity, and &quot;...a special quality of wrong that appears if a maid still under her father's care is debauched&quot; (pg. 229). Seduction involves a discussion of property, as an unmarried girl is property of her father. A virgin, even though free from the bond of marriage, is not free from the bond of her family. When a virgin is violated without a promise of engagement, she is prevented from having honorable marriage, which is shameful to herself and her family. A man who performs sexual acts with a virgin must &quot;endow her and have her to wife&quot;, and if the father, who is responsible for her, says no, then a man must pay a dowry to compensate for her loss of virginity and future chance of marriage. (pg. 229)

'''Unnatural vice:''' Unnatural vice is the worst kind of lust because it is unnatural in act and purpose. Many varieties of unnatural vice exist; Aquinas provides several examples, including [[bestiality]] or intercourse with a &quot;thing of another species&quot; (for example, an animal), incest, sodomy and &quot;not observing the right manner of copulation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa/summa.SS_Q154_A12.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychoanalysis and psychology==
{{Main|libido}}
Lust, in the domain of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychology]], is often treated as a case of &quot;heightened libido&quot;.

The '''Bay of Pigs''' ({{lang-es|Bahía de Cochinos}}) is an [[inlet]] of the [[Gulf of Cazones]] located on the southern coast of [[Cuba]]. By 1910, it was included in [[Santa Clara Province]], and then instead to [[Las Villas Province]] by 1961, but in 1976, it was reassigned to [[Matanzas Province]], when the original six provinces of Cuba were re-organized into 14 new [[Provinces of Cuba]].

The bay is historically important for the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] of 1961. The area is a site known for its diving, with an abundance of marine fauna, e.g. 30 species of sponges belonging to 19 families and 21 genera,&lt;ref name=Caballero2009_p95&gt;Caballero et al., 2009, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; to be found in the bay.&lt;ref name=BuceoGiron/&gt;

== Etymology ==
In [[Cuban Spanish]], ''cochinos'' may also mean the queen triggerfish (''[[Balistes vetula]]''), which inhabit coral reefs in Bahía de Cochinos, not [[swine]] (''[[Sus scrofa]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =Claro | first =Rodolfo |author2= García-Arteaga, Juan P.|author3= Gobert, Bertrand|author4= Cantelar Ramos, Karel | title =Tabla 2.

[[File:BahiadeCochinos40b.png|thumb|left|150px|Bay of Pigs, 1961]]
Playa Girón and Playa Larga were the landing sites for seaborne forces of armed Cuban exiles in the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], an American [[CIA]]-sponsored attempt to overthrow the new government of Cuban Prime Minister [[Fidel Castro]] in April 1961.

According to Fidel Castro's former bodyguard, the late Juan Reinaldo Sánchez, Castro lived in great luxury and had a private island called Cayo Piedra in the Bay of Pigs, replete with &quot;mansions, guest houses, a heliport, dolphinarium, turtle lagoon, his luxury yacht ''Aquarama'' – a gift from [[Leonid Brezhnev]] – and deep-sea fishing speedboat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|es}} [https://www.lainformacion.com/mundo/cerca-de-20-mansiones-tres-yates-y-un-helipuerto-son-algunas-de-las-posesiones-de-fidel-castro_EiSeOSScA5c56PZiM4AlV3/ Cerca de 20 mansiones, tres yates y un helipuerto son algunas de las posesiones de Fidel Castro]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bay of Pigs is a relatively quiet site for diving. Dive centers exist in Playa Larga, Playa Girón and Caleta Buena. Twelve dive sites in the bay display excellent visibility of {{convert|20|to|40|m|ft}}, an average water temperature of {{convert|22|C|F}} in December and {{convert|29|C|F}} in July. Walls of coral, caverns and a variety of fish (including the [[barracuda]], [[lionfish]] and [[grouper]]s, among others), coral and sponges can be found in the Bay of Pigs.&lt;ref name=BuceoGiron&gt;{{in lang|es}} [http://divescover.es/diving/cuba/playa-giron-bahia-de-cochinos Bucear en Playa Girón - Bahía de Cochinos]&lt;/ref&gt;

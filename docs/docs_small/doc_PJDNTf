The tour was a tremendous success, with Valentino and Rambova performing in 88 cities in the United States and Canada. In addition to the tour, Valentino also sponsored Mineralava beauty products and judged Mineralava-sponsored beauty contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midnightpalace.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27|title=Rudolph Valentino &amp; the Mineralava Tour of 1923|last=Lorusso |first=Edward |accessdate=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; One beauty contest was filmed by a young [[David O.

===Return to films===
[[File:Rudolph valentino i sangue e arena, 1922.jpg|thumb|210px|From ''[[A Sainted Devil]]'' (1924)]]
Valentino returned to the United States in reply to an offer from Ritz-Carlton Pictures (working through Famous Players), which included $7,500 a week, creative control, and filming in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider256&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 256–279.&lt;/ref&gt; Rambova negotiated a two-picture deal with Famous Players and four pictures for Ritz-Carlton.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider280&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 280–300&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted, turning down an offer to film an Italian production of ''Quo Vadis'' in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider256&quot; /&gt;

The first film under the new contract was ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (1924 film)|Monsieur Beaucaire]],'' wherein Valentino played the lead, the Duke of Chartres. The film did poorly and American audiences found it &quot;effeminate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider301&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 301–325&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the film, under Rambova's control, is often seen as proof of her controlling nature and later caused her to be barred from Valentino sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider280&quot; /&gt; Valentino made one final movie for Famous Players. In 1924, he starred in ''A Sainted Devil,'' now one of his lost films. It had lavish costumes, but apparently a weak story. It opened to strong sales, but soon dropped off in attendance and ended up as another disappointment.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider301&quot; /&gt;

With his contract fulfilled, Valentino was released from Famous Players, but was still obligated to Ritz-Carlton for four films. Valentino's next film was a pet project titled ''The Hooded Falcon.'' The production was beset with problems from the start, beginning with the script written by June Mathis. The Valentinos were dissatisfied with Mathis's version and requested that it be rewritten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Michael|title=Madam Valentino|year=1991|publisher=Abbeville Press|pages=156, 157|isbn=1-55859-136-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathis took it as a great insult and did not speak to Valentino for almost two years.&lt;ref&gt;Leider, pp. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt; While Rambova worked designing costumes and rewriting the script for ''Falcon,'' Valentino was persuaded to film ''[[Cobra (1925 film)|Cobra]]'' with [[Nita Naldi]]. Valentino agreed only on condition that it not be released until after ''The Hooded Falcon'' debuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Michael |title=Madam Valentino |year=1991 |publisher=Abbeville Press |page=159 |isbn=1-55859-136-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rudolph Valentino with beard 1924.jpg|thumb|Valentino sporting a [[Van Dyke beard]], 1924]]
After filming ''Cobra,'' the cast of ''The Hooded Falcon'' sailed for France to be fitted for costumes. After three months, they returned to the United States, where Valentino's new beard, which he had grown for the film, caused a sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Leider, pp. 318–319&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I opened once a paper and I tell you what was in. It was Rudolph Valentino with a beard upon his chin. My heart stopped off from beating and I fainted dead away, and I never want to come to life until the judgement day,&quot; was soon printed in ''[[Photoplay]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wells |first=Margaret Caroline |date=February 1925 |title=What!!!

===United Artists===
[[File:Son of the Sheik.jpg|thumb|Poster for ''The Son of the Sheik'']]
During the filming of ''Monsieur Beaucaire,'' both [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] approached Valentino privately, due to his contract with Ritz-Carlton, about joining with [[United Artists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leider280&quot; /&gt; Valentino's contract with United Artists provided $10,000 a week for only three pictures a year, plus a percentage of his films. The contract excluded Rambova from production of his films and the film set. Valentino's acceptance of the terms caused a major rift in his marriage to Rambova. George Ullman, who had negotiated the contract with United Artists, offered Rambova $30,000 to finance a film of her own. It became her only film, titled ''[[What Price Beauty?]]'' and starred [[Myrna Loy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Michael |title=Madam Valentino |year=1991 |publisher=Abbeville Press |pages=162, 163, 164 |isbn=1-55859-136-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentino chose his first UA project, ''[[The Eagle (1925 film)|The Eagle]].'' With the marriage under strain, Valentino began shooting and Rambova announced that she needed a &quot;marital vacation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Michael |title=Madam Valentino |year=1991 |publisher=Abbeville Press |page=169 |isbn=1-55859-136-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming of ''The Eagle,'' rumors of an affair with co-star [[Vilma Bánky]] were reported and ultimately denied by both Bánky and Valentino.&lt;ref name=&quot;botham&quot; /&gt; The film opened to positive reviews, but a moderate box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider326&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 326–350&lt;/ref&gt;

For the film's release, Valentino travelled to London, staying there and in France, spending money with abandon while his divorce took place. Quite some time elapsed before he made another film, ''[[The Son of the Sheik]],'' despite his hatred of the sheik image.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider351&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 351–370&lt;/ref&gt; The film began shooting in February 1926, with Valentino given his choice of director, and pairing him again with Vilma Bánky. The film used the authentic costumes he bought abroad and allowed him to play a dual role. Valentino was ill during production, but he needed the money to pay his many debts. The film opened on July 9, 1926, to great fanfare. During the premiere, Valentino was reconciled with Mathis; the two had not spoken in almost two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider351&quot; /&gt;

==Image==
Dating back to the de Saulles trial in New York, during which his masculinity had been questioned in print, Valentino had been very sensitive about his public perception. Women loved him and thought him the epitome of romance. However, American men were less impressed, walking out of his movies in disgust. With the Fairbanks type being the epitome of manhood, Valentino was seen as a threat to the &quot;All American&quot; man. One man, asked in a street interview in 1922 what he thought of Valentino, replied, &quot;Many other men desire to be another Douglas Fairbanks. But Valentino? I wonder ...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;leider197&quot; /&gt; Women in the same interview found Valentino &quot;triumphantly seductive. Puts the love-making of the average husband or sweetheart into discard as tame, flat, and unimpassioned.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;leider197&quot; /&gt; Men may have wanted to act like Fairbanks, but they copied Valentino's look. A man with perfectly greased-back hair was called a &quot;Vaselino&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider197&quot; /&gt;
Some journalists were still calling his masculinity into question, going on at length about his pomaded hair, his [[dandy]]ish clothing, his treatment of women, his views on women, and whether he was effeminate or not. Valentino hated these stories and was known to carry the clippings of the newspaper articles around with him and criticize them.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider1&quot; /&gt;

In July 1926, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported that a vending machine dispensing pink talcum powder had appeared in an upscale hotel's men's washroom. An editorial that followed used the story to protest the feminization of American men, and blamed the talcum powder on Valentino and his films. The piece infuriated Valentino and he challenged the writer to a boxing match, since [[dueling]] was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,722230,00.html | work=Time | title=The Press: Personal Puff | date=August 2, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither challenge was answered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edmiston|first=Fred W.|title=The Coon-Sanders Nighthawks: The Band that Made Radio Famous|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|page=31|isbn=0-7864-1340-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, Valentino met with journalist [[H. L. Mencken]] for advice on how best to deal with the incident. Mencken advised Valentino to &quot;let the dreadful farce roll along to exhaustion,&quot;&lt;ref name=afterlife&gt;{{cite book |title=The Valentino Mystique: The Death And Afterlife Of The Silent Film Idol |last=Ellenberger |first=Allan R. |author2=Ballerini, Edoardo  |year=2005 |publisher=McFarland |page= 22|isbn=0-7864-1950-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Valentino insisted the editorial was &quot;infamous.&quot;&lt;ref name=afterlife /&gt; Mencken found Valentino to be likable and gentlemanly and wrote sympathetically of him in an article published in the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' a week after Valentino's death:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Valentino Mystique: The Death And Afterlife Of The Silent Film Idol |last=Ellenberger |first=Allan R. |author2=Ballerini, Edoardo  |year=2005 |publisher=McFarland |page=23|isbn=0-7864-1950-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It was not that trifling Chicago episode that was riding him; it was the whole grotesque futility of his life. Had he achieved, out of nothing, a vast and dizzy success?

The thing, at the start, must have only bewildered him, but in those last days, unless I am a worse psychologist than even the professors of psychology, it was revolting him. Worse, it was making him afraid ...

Here was a young man who was living daily the dream of millions of other men. Here was one who was catnip to women. Here was one who had wealth and fame.

After Valentino challenged the ''Tribune's'' anonymous writer to a boxing match, the ''New York Evening Journal'' boxing writer, Frank O'Neill, volunteered to fight in his place. Valentino won the bout, which took place on the roof of New York's Ambassador Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawthorne |first=Nigel |title=Sex Lives of the Hollywood Idols |url=https://archive.org/details/sexlivesofhollyw00nige |url-access=registration |publisher=PRION |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavyweight champion [[Jack Dempsey]], who trained Valentino and other Hollywood notables of the era in boxing, said of him: &quot;He was the most virile and masculine of men. The women were like flies to a honeypot. He could never shake them off, anywhere he went. What a lovely, lucky guy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Botham, Noel. ''Valentino: The First Superstar''. Metro Books, 2002. {{ISBN|1-84358-013-6}}. p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentino's sex symbol status and his untimely death were a biographical part in [[John Dos Passos]]'s ''The Big Money'' in the [[U.S.A trilogy]]. His title was the Adagio Dancer.&lt;ref&gt;Dos Passos, John. U.S.A. New York: literary classics of the United States, 1996. Print. U.S.A Trilogy.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Valentino published a book of poetry titled ''[[Day Dreams (book)|Day Dreams]]''.&lt;ref name=astor&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Stanley |title=Mrs. Astor's Horse |date=March 2007 |page=222 |isbn=978-1-4067-3888-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later serialized events in various magazines. With ''[[Liberty (1924–1950)|Liberty]]'' magazine, he wrote a series entitled, &quot;How You Can Keep Fit&quot; in 1923.&lt;ref name=astor/&gt; &quot;My Life Story&quot; was serialized in ''Photoplay'' during his dance tour. The March issue was one of the best-selling ever for the magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider232&quot; /&gt; He followed that with &quot;My Private Diary&quot;, serialized in ''Movie Weekly'' magazine. Most of the serials were later published as books after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rudolph-valentino.com/books.htm ''Books and Articles by Rudolph Valentino'']. Rudolph-Valentino.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentino was fascinated with every part of movie-making. During production on a Mae Murray film, he spent time studying the director's plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider86&quot; /&gt; He craved authenticity and wished to shoot on location,&lt;ref name=&quot;leider131&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leider197&quot; /&gt; finally forming his own production company, Rudolph Valentino Productions, in 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider326&quot; /&gt; Valentino, George Ullman, and Beatrice Ullman were the incorporators.

On May 14, 1923, while in New York City, Valentino made his only two vocal recordings for [[Brunswick Records]]; &quot;[[Kashmiri Song]]&quot; (''The Sheik'') and &quot;El Relicario&quot; (''Blood and Sand'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Music of the Sound Screen |url=https://archive.org/stream/newmoviemagazine02weir#page/n549/mode/2up |journal=The New Movie |location=Jamaica, New York |publisher=Tower Magazines, Inc. |date=November 1930 |access-date=November 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recordings were not released until after Valentino's death by the Celebrity Recording Company; Brunswick did not release them because Valentino's English/Spanish pronunciation was subpar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,740341,00.html |title=International A? |date=1930-05-22 |work=Time |accessdate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentino was one of the first in Hollywood to offer an award for artistic accomplishments in films; the [[Academy Awards]] later followed suit. In 1925, he gave out his only medal to [[John Barrymore]] for his performance in ''[[Beau Brummel (1924 film)|Beau Brummel]].'' The award, named the Rudolph Valentino Medal, required the agreement of Valentino, two judges, and the votes of 75 critics. Everyone other than Valentino himself was eligible.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider326&quot; /&gt;

Valentino once told gossip columnist [[Louella Parsons]] that: &quot;The women I love don't love me. The others don't matter&quot;. He claims that despite his success as a sex symbol that in his personal love life he never achieved happiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Gay Illiterate&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parsons|first1=Louella|title=The Gay Illiterate|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.60193/page/n17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|90}}
 
In 1919—just before the rise of his career—Valentino impulsively married actress [[Jean Acker]], who was involved with actresses [[Grace Darmond]] and [[Alla Nazimova]]. Acker became involved with Valentino in part to remove herself from the lesbian love triangle, quickly regretted the marriage, and locked Valentino out of their room on their wedding night. The couple separated soon after, and the marriage was never [[consummate]]d.&lt;ref name=&quot;pop&quot; /&gt; The couple remained legally married until 1921, when Acker sued Valentino for divorce, citing desertion.&lt;ref name=&quot;botham&quot; /&gt; The divorce was granted, with Acker receiving alimony. She and Valentino eventually renewed their friendship, and remained friends until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;pop&quot; /&gt;

Valentino first met Winifred Shaughnessy, known by her stage name, [[Natacha Rambova]]—an American silent film costume and set designer, [[art director]], and protégée of Nazimova—on the set of ''Uncharted Seas'' in 1921. The two worked together on the Nazimova production of ''Camille,'' by which time they were romantically involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Michael |title=Madam Valentino |year=1991 |publisher=Abbeville Press |pages=74, 77, 78 |isbn=1-55859-136-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married on May 13, 1922, in [[Mexicali]], [[Mexico]], which resulted in Valentino's arrest for [[bigamy]], since he had not been divorced for a full year, as required by California law at the time. Days passed and his studio at the time, Famous Players-Lasky, refused to post bail. Eventually, a few friends were able to post the cash bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=David |title=Lost Hollywood |date=7 April 2001 |publisher=Macmillan |page=[https://archive.org/details/losthollywood0000wall/page/48 48] |isbn=0-312-26195-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/losthollywood0000wall/page/48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also investigated for a possible violation of the [[Mann Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4303093/pajama_revel_by_valentino_party_is_bared/|title=Pajama Revel By Valentino Party is Bared|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=19 May 1922|page=1|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having to wait the year or face the possibility of being arrested again, Rambova and Valentino lived in separate apartments in New York City, each with their own roommates. On March 14, 1923, they legally remarried at the Lake County Court House in [[Crown Point, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Michael |title=Madam Valentino |year=1991 |publisher=Abbeville Press |page=133 |isbn=1-55859-136-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Valentino's friends disliked Rambova and found her controlling.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider326&quot; /&gt; During his relationship with her, he lost many friends and business associates, including June Mathis. Towards the end of their marriage, Rambova was banned from his sets by contract. Valentino and Rambova divorced in 1925. The end of the marriage was bitter, with Valentino bequeathing Rambova one dollar in his will.&lt;ref name=&quot;botham&quot; /&gt;

From the time he died in 1926 until the 1960s, Valentino's sexuality was not generally questioned in print.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Allan R. Ellenberger, ''The Valentino Mystique,'' 15, Mcfarland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Michael, ''Madame Valentino,'' 264&lt;/ref&gt; At least four books, including the notoriously libelous ''[[Hollywood Babylon]],'' suggested that he may have been [[Homosexuality|gay]] despite his marriage to Rambova.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Morris, Michael, ''Madame Valentino,'' 263–264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Soares, Andre, Beyond Paradise, 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan R.

For some, the marriages to Acker and Rambova, as well as the relationship with [[Pola Negri]], add to the suspicion that Valentino was gay and that these were &quot;[[lavender marriage]]s.&quot;

Such books gave rise to claims that Valentino had a relationship with [[Ramón Novarro]], despite Novarro stating they barely knew each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt; ''Hollywood Babylon'' recounts a story that Valentino had given Novarro an [[art deco]] [[dildo]] as a gift, which was found stuffed in his throat at the time of his murder. No such gift existed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt;
These books also gave rise to claims that he may have had relationships with both roommates Paul Ivano and Douglas Gerrad, as well as Norman Kerry, and openly gay [[France|French]] theatre director and poet [[Jacques Hébertot]].&lt;ref&gt;Leider, pp. 81, 271–272&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ivano maintained that it was untrue and both he and Valentino were [[heterosexual]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leider111&quot; /&gt; Biographers Emily Leider and Allan Ellenberger generally agree that he was most likely straight.&lt;ref&gt;Allan R. Ellenberger, ''The Valentino Mystique,'' 16, Mcfarland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leider, pp. 81, 126, 271–274&lt;/ref&gt;

There was further supposed evidence that Valentino was gay; documents in the estate of the late author [[Phil Andros|Samuel Steward]] indicated that Valentino and Steward were sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Cohen, &quot;Sexual Outlaw on the Gay Frontier&quot;, ''The New York Times'' (July 25, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; However, evidence found in Steward's claim was subsequently found to be false, as Valentino was in New York on the date Steward claimed a sexual encounter occurred in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Gladysz, &quot;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thomas-gladysz/the-secret-historian-and-_b_700927.html The Secret Historian and the Silent Film Star: One Was Gay],&quot; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' (August 31, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before his death, Valentino was dating ''Ziegfeld Follies'' showgirl Marion Wilson Benda&lt;ref&gt;Mallory Curley, ''Zeppo's Marion Benda and Valentino's Marion Benda: A Legacy of Confusion'' (Randy Press, 2016), pp. 17, 20-22, 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; while he was also involved in a relationship with actress [[Pola Negri]]. Upon his death, Negri made a scene at his funeral, claiming they had been engaged, in spite of the fact that Valentino had never mentioned this engagement to anyone himself.&lt;ref name=astor /&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Valentinofuneral.jpg|thumb|A mourner grieves at the [[bier]] of Rudolph Valentino during the actor's funeral]]

On August 15, 1926, Valentino collapsed at the Hotel Ambassador on [[345 Park Avenue|Park Avenue]] in Manhattan. He was hospitalized at the New York Polyclinic Hospital. Following an examination, he was diagnosed with [[appendicitis]] and [[gastric ulcers]], and surgery was performed immediately. (His condition was referred to as &quot;[[Valentino's syndrome]]&quot;—perforated ulcers mimicking appendicitis.) After surgery, Valentino developed [[peritonitis]]. On August 18, his doctors were optimistic about his prognosis. The media were told that unless Valentino's condition deteriorated, no updates would be given.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plattsburgh-sentinel&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news2.nnyln.net/plattsburgh-sentinel/1926/plattsburgh-sentinel-1926-july-september%20-%200091.pdf |title=Valentino Loses Battle With Death: Greatest of Screen Lovers Fought Valiantly For Life |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The Plattsburgh Sentinel]] |page=1 |date=August 24, 1926 |accessdate=2010-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723230738/http://news2.nnyln.net/plattsburgh-sentinel/1926/plattsburgh-sentinel-1926-july-september%20-%200091.pdf |archivedate=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his condition worsened on August 21. He was stricken with a severe relapse of [[pleuritis]], which developed rapidly in his left [[human lung|lung]] due to his weakened condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plattsburgh-sentinel&quot; /&gt; The doctors realized that Valentino was going to die, but as was common at the time, chose to withhold this information. Valentino reportedly believed that he would recover. During the early hours of Monday, August 23, Valentino was briefly conscious and chatted with his doctors about his future, but soon lapsed into a coma. He died a few hours later at the age of 31.&lt;ref name=&quot;botham&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plattsburgh-sentinel&quot; /&gt;

Valentino's funeral mass in Manhattan was held on Monday, 30 August at [[Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church]], often called &quot;The Actor's Chapel&quot;, as it is located on West 49th Street in the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Broadway theater district]], and has a long association with show-business figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;mystique&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Valentino Mystique: The Death and Afterlife of the Silent Film Idol |last=Ellenberger |first=Allan R. |author2=Ballerini, Edoardo  |year=2005 |publisher=McFarland |page= 193|isbn=0-7864-1950-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Valentino's remains were taken by train from New York to California, a second funeral was held on the West Coast, at the Catholic [[Church of the Good Shepherd (Beverly Hills, California)|Church of the Good Shepherd]] in [[Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mystique&quot; /&gt; Valentino had no final burial arrangements and his friend [[June Mathis]] arranged a temporary solution when she offered a crypt that she had purchased for the husband that she had since divorced.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, Kevin.

===Estate===
Valentino left his estate to his brother, sister, and Rambova's aunt Teresa Werner, who was left the share originally bequeathed to Rambova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,880917,00.html |title=People: Sep. 20, 1926 |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=2008-03-24 |date=September 20, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Beverly Hills mansion, [[Falcon Lair]], was later owned by heiress [[Doris Duke]]. Duke died there in 1993. The home was later sold and underwent major renovations. The main building of the estate was razed in 2006, and the property was then put back on the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;mystique&quot; /&gt;

After Valentino's death, many of his films were reissued to help pay his estate expenses. Many were reissued well into the 1930s, long after the demise of silent film. Several books were written, including one by Rambova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Michael |title=Madam Valentino |year=1991 |publisher=Abbeville Press |pages=190, 191 |isbn=1-55859-136-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A photo montage print showed Valentino arriving in Heaven and being greeted by [[Enrico Caruso]].

Over the years, a &quot;woman in black&quot; carrying a red rose has come to mourn at Valentino's crypt, usually on the anniversary of his death. Several myths surround the woman, though it seems the first woman in black was actually a publicity stunt cooked up by press agent Russel Birdwell in 1928. A woman named Ditra Flame claimed to be the original &quot;woman in black&quot;. Several copycats have followed over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760116,00.html |title=Woman in Black |date=1938-09-05 |magazine=Time |accessdate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally a PR stunt, it has become a tradition. The current &quot;woman in black&quot; is motion picture historian Karie Bible. This myth of &quot;woman in black&quot; was also a source of inspiration for the song &quot;[[Long Black Veil]]&quot;.

Valentino's hometown of Castellaneta, Italy, has created several services in his honor. The Museo Rodolfo Valentino was opened in his childhood home and a statue was unveiled in 1961. Fondazione Rodolfo Valentino was created to promote his life and his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionevalentino.it/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=53 |title=the Rudolph Valentino Foundation was born in Castellaneta, an organization dedicated to Rudolph Valentino, honorary president is Silvie's Day, the nephew of the great star. |date=2009-02-13 |publisher=fondazionevalentino.it |language=Italian |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lsdmagazine.com/e-nata-la-fondazione-rodolfo-valentino-nella-sua-natia-castellaneta/ |title=E' nata la Fondazione Rodolfo Valentino nella sua natia Castellaneta|last=Gagliano Candela |first=Eleonora |date=2007-02-17 |magazine=lsdmagazine.com |language=Italian |accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a film school was also opened in his hometown, Centro Studi Cine Club Rodolfo Valentino Castellaneta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libero-news.it/adnkronos/view/59570 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20111005061830/http://www.libero-news.it/adnkronos/view/59570 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-10-05 |title=Cinema: Nasce Fondazione Rodolfo Valentino, L'Omagg di Castellaneta Al 'Sud' Divo |date=2009-02-17 |publisher=libero-news.it |language=Italian |accessdate=2009-11-28 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1995 centennial of his birth, several events were held in his honor. From 1972 to 2006, an Italian acting award—The Rudolph Valentino Award—was handed out every year. Several actors from all over the world received this award, including [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rudolphvalentinoawards.com|title=Rudolph Valentino Awards |publisher=premiorodolfovalentino.it |accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, an opera by [[Dominick Argento]] (libretto by Charles Nolte) entitled ''The Dream of Valentino'' was premiered by the [[Washington National Opera]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boosey.com/pages/opera/moreDetails?musicID=6329|title=The Dream of Valentino |publisher=boosey&amp;hawkes.com|accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews were not enthusiastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/17/arts/review-opera-clashing-keys-for-valentino.html|title=Review of The Dream of Valentino|newspaper=nytimes.com|accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opera was revived by the [[Minnesota Opera]] in 2014, with similar reviews.

In Italy in 2006, a one-off film festival was planned to celebrate the opening of the Museo Rodolfo Valentino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/puglia/new-festival-and-acting-school-rudolph-valentino|title=New Festival and Acting School For Rudolph Valentino|date=2005-08-25|publisher=italymag.co.uk|accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the American Society held the Rudolph Valentino Film Festival in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therudolphvalentinofilmfestival.com/about.html|title=The Rudolph Valentino Film Festival|publisher=therudolphvalentinofilmfestival.com|accessdate=2009-11-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123144201/http://therudolphvalentinofilmfestival.com/about.html|archivedate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor Oliver Clark makes a cameo in the 1971 film ''[[They Might Be Giants (film)|They Might Be Giants]]'' as a nonverbal psychiatric patient nicknamed Mr. Small, who is under the delusion that he is Valentino and refuses to speak until recognized.

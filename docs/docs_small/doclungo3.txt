[[File:Jimmy Carter Library and Museum 99.JPG|thumb|right|A typical non-dial red phone used for hotlines. This one is a prop which is on display in the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum, erroneously representing the [[Moscow–Washington hotline]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2013/08/the-red-phone-that-was-not-on-hotline.html The red phone that was NOT on the Hotline]. electrospaces.blogspot.nl. 30 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''hotline''' is a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[information transfer|communications]] [[Data link|link]] in which a [[telephone call|call]] is automatically directed to the preselected destination without any additional action by the [[User (telecommunications)|user]] when the [[end instrument]] goes [[off-hook]].&lt;ref&gt;Derived from [[Federal Standard 1037C]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be a phone that automatically connects to emergency services on picking up the receiver. Therefore, dedicated hotline phones do not need a rotary dial or keypad. A hotline can also be called an automatic [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]], [[ringdown]], or off-hook service.

== For crises and service ==
True hotlines cannot be used to originate calls other than to preselected destinations.  However, in common or colloquial usage, a &quot;hotline&quot; often refers to a [[call center]] reachable by dialing a standard telephone number, or sometimes the phone numbers themselves.

This is especially the case with 24-hour, noncommercial numbers, such as police tip hotlines or suicide [[crisis hotline]]s, which are staffed around the clock and thereby give the appearance of real hotlines.  Increasingly, however, the term is found being applied to any customer service telephone number.

==Between states==

=== Russia–United States ===
The most famous hotline between states is the [[Moscow–Washington hotline]], which is also known as the &quot;red telephone&quot;, although telephones have never been used in this capacity. This direct communications link was established on 20 June 1963, in the wake of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and utilized teletypewriter technology, later replaced by telecopier and then by electronic mail.

=== United Kingdom–United States ===

Already during [[World War II]]&amp;mdash;two decades before the Washington–Moscow hotline was established&amp;mdash;there was a hotline between [[No. 10 Downing Street]] and the [[Churchill War Rooms|Cabinet War Room]] bunker under the Treasury, Whitehall; with the [[White House]] in Washington, D.C. From 1943 to 1946, this link was made secure by using the very first voice encryption machine, called [[SIGSALY]].

=== China–Russia ===
A hotline connection between [[Beijing]] and [[Moscow]] was used during the 1969 frontier confrontation between the two countries. The Chinese however refused the Russian peace attempts and ended the communications link. After a reconciliation between the former enemies, the hotline between China and Russia was revived in 1996.&lt;ref name=clingendael&gt;{{cite news|last=Egilsson|first=Haraldur|title=The Origins, Use and Development of Hotline Diplomacy|url=http://www.clingendael.nl/publications/2003/20030500_cli_paper_dip_issue85.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=Discussion Papers in Diplomacy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911055513/http://www.clingendael.nl/publications/2003/20030500_cli_paper_dip_issue85.pdf|archive-date=11 September 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France–Russia ===
On his visit to the Soviet Union in 1966, French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] announced that a hotline would be established between Paris and Moscow. The line was upgraded from a telex to a high-speed fax machine in 1989.&lt;ref name=clingendael /&gt;

=== Russia–United Kingdom ===
A London–Moscow hotline was not formally established until a treaty of friendship between the two countries in 1992. An upgrade was announced when Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] visited Moscow in 2011.&lt;ref name=clingendael /&gt;

=== India–Pakistan ===
On 20 June 2004, both [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] agreed to extend a nuclear testing ban and to set up an [[Islamabad–New Delhi hotline]] between their foreign secretaries aimed at preventing misunderstandings that might lead to nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-and-pakistan-to-have-nuclear-hotline-732980.html|title=India and Pakistan to have nuclear hotline|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotline was set up with the assistance of [[United States military]] officers.

=== China–United States ===
The United States and [[China]] set up a defense hotline in 2008, but it has rarely been used in crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gienger|first=Viola|title=China-U.S. Defense Hotline Shows Gulf Between Nations|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-13/china-u-s-defense-hotline-shows-gulf.html|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China–India ===
India and China announced a hotline for the foreign ministers of both countries while reiterating their commitment to strengthening ties and building &quot;mutual political trust&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/finally-a-hotline-between-india-and-china-63893 |title=Finally, a hotline between India and China |publisher=Ndtv.com |date=1 November 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2015 the hotline was yet to be made operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/narendra-modi-barack-obama-hotline-becomes-operational/|title=Narendra Modi-Barack Obama hotline becomes operational|date=21 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China–Japan ===
In February 2013, the [[Senkaku Islands dispute]] gave renewed impetus to a China–Japan hotline, which had been agreed to but due to rising tensions had not been established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1146826/japan-suggests-hotline-beijing-over-island-spat Japan suggests hotline to Beijing over island spat]. scmp.com. 9 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North and South Korea ===
Between North and South Korea there are over 40 [[Seoul-Pyongyang hotline|direct phone lines]], the first of which was opened in September 1971. Most of these hotlines run through the [[Panmunjeom]] [[Joint Security Area]] (JSA) and are maintained by the [[Red Cross]]. Since 1971, North Korea has deactivated the hotlines seven times, the last time in February 2016. After [[Kim Jong-un]]'s New Years address, the border hotline was reopened on January 3, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42549161 North Korea reopens hotline to South to discuss Olympics] BBC News 3 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India–United States ===
In August 2015 the hotline between the [[White House]] and New Delhi became operational. The decision of establishing this hotline was taken during Obama's visit to India in January 2015. This is the first hotline connecting an Indian Prime Minister to a head of state.&lt;ref&gt;PTI [http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/narendra-modi-barack-obama-hotline-becomes-operational &quot;Modi-Obama hotline becomes operational&quot;], ''[[The Indian Express]]'', Washington, 21 August 2015.

[[File:Juancito.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A [[mule]] is a [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]] hybrid of a male [[donkey]] and a female [[horse]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Griesbach/&gt;--&gt; Mules are smaller than horses but stronger than donkeys, making them useful as [[pack animal]]s.]]

In [[biology]], a '''hybrid''' is the offspring resulting from combining the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through [[sexual reproduction]]. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in [[blending inheritance]]), but can show [[Heterosis|hybrid vigour]], sometimes growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In [[genetics]], attention is focused on the numbers of [[chromosome]]s. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent [[species]] are.

Species are [[reproductive isolation|reproductively isolated]] by strong barriers to hybridisation, which include genetic and morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before [[fertilization]] and others after it. Similar barriers exist in plants, with differences in flowering times, pollen vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and the structure of the chromosomes. A few animal species and many plant species, however, are the result of [[hybrid speciation]], including important crop plants such as [[wheat]], where the number of chromosomes has been doubled&lt;!--among much else, too complex for lead--&gt;.

[[Human impact on the environment]] has resulted in an increase in the interbreeding between regional species, and the proliferation of [[introduced species]] worldwide has also resulted in an increase in hybridisation. This [[genetic mixing]] may threaten many species with extinction, while [[genetic erosion]] from [[monoculture]] in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding.  A form of often intentional human-mediated hybridisation is the crossing of wild and domesticated species. This is common in both traditional [[horticulture]] and modern [[agriculture]]; many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs, and trees have been produced by hybridisation. One such flower, ''[[Oenothera lamarckiana]]'', was central to early genetics research into [[mutationism]] and polyploidy.  It is also more occasionally done in the livestock and pet trades; some well-known wild × domestic hybrids are [[beefalo]] and [[wolfdog]]s.  Human [[selective breeding]] of [[domesticated animals]] and [[Domesticated plants|plants]] has resulted in the development of distinct [[breeds]] (usually called [[cultivar]]s in reference to plants); [[crossbreed]]s between them (without any wild [[Foundation stock|stock]]) are sometimes also imprecisely referred to as &quot;hybrids&quot;.

[[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|Hybrid humans]] existed in prehistory. For example, [[Neanderthals]] and anatomically modern humans are thought to have interbred as recently as 40,000 years ago.

[[Mythological hybrid]]s appear in human culture in forms as diverse as the [[Minotaur]], blends of animals, humans and mythical beasts such as [[centaur]]s and [[sphinx]]es, and the [[Nephilim]] of the [[Biblical apocrypha]] described as the wicked sons of [[fallen angel]]s and attractive women.

==Etymology==
[[File:Liger.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Liger]], a lion/tiger hybrid bred in captivity]]

The term hybrid is derived from Latin ''{{lang|la|hybrida}}'', used for crosses such as of a tame sow and a wild boar. The term came into popular use in English in the 19th century, though examples of its use have been found from the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hybrid |title=Hybrid |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conspicuous hybrids are popularly named with [[portmanteau word]]s, starting in the 1920s with the breeding of tiger–lion hybrids ([[liger]] and [[tigon]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;When the sire is a lion the result is termed a Liger, whilst the converse is a Tigon.&quot; Edward George Boulenger, ''World natural history'', B. T. Batsford ltd., 1937, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==As seen by different disciplines==

===Animal and plant breeding===

From the point of view of animal and plant breeders, there are several kinds of hybrid formed from crosses within a species, such as between different [[breeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wricke, Gunter |author2=Weber, Eberhard  |date=1986 |title=Quantitative genetics and selection in plant breeding |publisher=W. de Gruyter |page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Single cross hybrids result from the cross between two [[true-breeding organism]]s which produces an [[F1 hybrid]] (first filial generation). The cross between two different [[homozygous]] lines produces an F1 hybrid that is [[heterozygous]]; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is [[Dominance relationship#Dominant allele|dominant]] and the other [[Dominance relationship#Recessive allele|recessive]]. Typically, the F1 generation is also [[phenotype|phenotypically]] homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Principles of Molecular Medicine | editor1=Runge, Marschall S. |editor2=Patterson, Cam | publisher=Humana Press | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-58829-202-5 | page=58 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-_rAKRf3WwC&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Double cross hybrids result from the cross between two different F1 hybrids (i.e., there are four unrelated grandparents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rawlings, J. O. |author2=Cockerham, C. Clark  |title=Analysis of Double Cross Hybrid Populations |journal=Biometrics |volume=18 |issue=2 |date=June 1962 |pages=229–244 |doi=10.2307/2527461|jstor=2527461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Three-way cross hybrids result from the cross between an F1 hybrid and an inbred line. Triple cross hybrids result from the crossing of two different three-way cross hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson |first1=K. F. |title=Triple-cross hybrid kale |journal=Euphytica |date=1964 |volume=13 |page=173 |doi=10.1007/BF00033306 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00033306|doi-broken-date=10 October 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Top cross (or &quot;topcross&quot;) hybrids result from the crossing of a top quality or pure-bred male and a lower quality female, intended to improve the quality of the offspring, on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Topcross |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/topcross |dictionary=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population hybrids result from the crossing of plants or animals in one [[population]] with those of another population. These include interspecific hybrids or crosses between different breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCarthy |first=Eugene M. |title=Hybrid Populations |url=http://www.macroevolution.net/hybrid-populations.html |website=Macroevolution |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[horticulture]], the term stable hybrid is used to describe an [[annual plant]] that, if grown and bred in a small [[monoculture]] free of external [[pollen]] (e.g., an air-filtered greenhouse) produces offspring that are &quot;true to type&quot; with respect to phenotype; i.e., a true-breeding organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Toogood, A. |date=1999 |title=Plant Propagation |publisher=American Horticultural Society |isbn=978-0-7894-5520-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/plantpropagation00newy/page/21 21] |url=https://archive.org/details/plantpropagation00newy/page/21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogeography===
{{further|Hybrid zone}}

Hybridisation can occur in the [[hybrid zone]]s where the geographical ranges of species, subspecies, or distinct genetic lineages overlap. For example, the butterfly ''[[Limenitis arthemis]]'' has two major subspecies in North America, ''L. a. arthemis'' (the white admiral) and ''L. a. astyanax'' (the red-spotted purple). The white admiral has a bright, white band on its wings, while the red-spotted purple has cooler blue-green shades. Hybridisation occurs between a narrow area across New England, southern Ontario, and the Great Lakes, the &quot;suture region&quot;. It is at these regions that the subspecies were formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ries, Leslie |author2=Mullen, Sean P.  |year=2008 |title=A Rare Model Limits the Distribution of Its More Common Mimic: A Twist on Frequency-Dependent Batesian Mimicry |journal=Evolution |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=1798–803 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00401.x|pmid=18410533 |s2cid=42438552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hybrid zones have formed between described species of plants and animals.

===Genetics===
[[File:Gruppenweise artbildung unter spezieller berücksichtigung der gattung Oenothera (Taf. II) (7164908226).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Oenothera lamarckiana]]'' is a permanent natural hybrid, studied intensively by the geneticist [[Hugo de Vries]]. Illustration by De Vries, 1913]]

From the point of view of genetics, several different kinds of hybrid can be distinguished.&lt;ref name=Rieger&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rieger, R. |author2=Michaelis A. |author3=Green, M. M. |date=1991 |title=Glossary of Genetics: Classical and Molecular |edition=5th |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-0-387-52054-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/glossaryofgeneti0000rieg/page/256 256] |url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofgeneti0000rieg/page/256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007&gt;{{cite book |last=Allendorf |first=Fred |title=Conservation and the Genetics of Populations |year=2007 |publisher=Blackwell |page=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A genetic hybrid carries two different [[allele]]s of the same [[gene]], where for instance one allele may code for a lighter coat colour than the other.&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; A structural hybrid results from the fusion of [[gamete]]s that have differing structure in at least one chromosome, as a result of [[Chromosome abnormality#Structural abnormalities|structural abnormalities]].&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; A numerical hybrid results from the fusion of gametes having different [[Ploidy|haploid numbers of chromosomes]].&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; A permanent hybrid results when only the heterozygous [[genotype]] occurs, as in ''[[Oenothera lamarckiana]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Sirks2013&quot;/&gt; because all homozygous combinations are lethal.&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; In the early history of genetics, [[Hugo de Vries]] supposed these were [[Mutationism|caused by mutation]].&lt;ref name=DeVries1901-1903&gt;{{cite book | author=De Vries, Hugo |authorlink=Hugo de Vries |year=1901–1903 | title= Die mutationstheorie.

===Taxonomy===

From the point of view of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], hybrids differ according to their parentage.
Hybrids between different [[subspecies]] (such as between the [[Dog]] and [[Eurasian wolf]]) are called intra-specific hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allendorf |first=Fred |title=Conservation and the Genetics of Populations |year=2007 |publisher=Blackwell |pages=421–448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interspecific hybrids are the offspring from [[interspecies mating]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Keeton, William T. |date=1980 |title=Biological Science |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-95021-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/biologicalscienc00keet/page/ A9] |url=https://archive.org/details/biologicalscienc00keet/page/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; these sometimes result in hybrid speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=M.L. |title=Natural Hybridisation and Evolution |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-509975-1 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergeneric hybrids result from matings between different genera, such as between [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[goat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kelk, Dawn A. |author2=Gartley, Cathy J. |author3=Buckrell, Brian C. |author4=King, W.

When two distinct types of organisms breed with each other, the resulting hybrids typically have intermediate traits (e.g., one plant parent has red flowers, the other has white, and the hybrid, pink flowers).&lt;ref name=M2006&gt;{{cite book |author=McCarthy, Eugene M. |year=2006 |title=Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one parent or the other (e.g., a [[bird hybrid]] might combine the yellow head of one parent with the orange belly of the other).&lt;ref name=M2006/&gt;

===Mechanisms of reproductive isolation===
{{main|Reproductive isolation}}

Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating individuals from two species, normally from within the same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]], preventing gene flow between the species.&lt;ref&gt;Keeton, William T. 1980. ''Biological science''. New York: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-95021-2}}, p. 800&lt;/ref&gt; Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the two species. For example, [[donkey]]s have 62 [[chromosomes]], [[horse]]s have 64 chromosomes, and [[mule]]s or [[hinny|hinnies]] have 63 chromosomes. Mules, hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during [[meiosis]], meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3378453 |year=1988 |last1=Rong |first1=R. |last2=Chandley |first2=A.

A variety of mechanisms limit the success of hybridisation, including the large genetic difference between most species. Barriers include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization; others after it.&lt;ref name=&quot;T.Baker&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Baker | first1=H.

In plants, some barriers to hybridisation include blooming period differences, different pollinator vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and structural differences of the chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Hermsen, J.

{{Main|Hybrid speciation|Hybrid zone}}

A few animal species are the result of hybridization. The [[Lonicera fly]] is a natural hybrid. The American [[red wolf]] appears to be a hybrid of the [[gray wolf]] and the [[coyote]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Esch|first=Mary |title=Study: Eastern wolves are hybrids with coyotes |url=http://archive.boston.com/news/science/articles/2011/05/31/study_eastern_wolves_are_hybrids_with_coyotes/ |work=Boston.com |agency=Associated Press |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=22 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Conservation genomics in perspective: A holistic approach to understanding Canis evolution in North America |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=155 |year=2012 |pages=186–192 |url=http://people.trentu.ca/brentpatterson/index_files/Rutledge%20et%20al%202012%20-%20conservation%20genomics%20in%20perspective.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2012.05.017 |last1=Rutledge |first1=Linda Y. |display-authors=etal }}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An account of the taxonomy of North American wolves from morphological and genetic analyses |year=2012|journal=North American Fauna |volume=77 |pages=1–67 |doi=10.3996/nafa.77.0001 |last1=Chambers |first1=Steven M. |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumbacher, J., [http://www.fws.gov/home/wolfrecovery/pdf/Final_Review_of_Proposed_rule_regarding_wolves2014.pdf Review of Proposed Rule Regarding Status of the Wolf Under the Endangered Species Act], NCEAS (January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The European [[edible frog]] is a semi-permanent hybrid between [[pool frog]]s and [[marsh frog]]s; its population requires the continued presence of at least one of the parent species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frost, Grant |display-authors=etal |title=The amphibian tree of life |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |issue=297 |date=15 March 2006|volume=297 |pages=1–291 |doi=10.1206/0003-0090(2006)297[0001:TATOL]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cave paintings indicate that the [[European bison]] is a natural hybrid of the [[aurochs]] and the [[steppe bison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soubrier |first=Julien|display-authors=etal |date=18 October 2016 |title=Early cave art and ancient DNA record the origin of European bison |journal=Nature Communications |volume=7 |doi=10.1038/ncomms13158 |pages=13158 |pmid=27754477 |pmc=5071849|bibcode=2016NatCo...713158S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-cave-art-helped-dig-new-animal-species-180960833/?no-ist |title=Cave Paintings Help Unravel the Mystery of the 'Higgs Bison' |last=Daley |first=Jason |newspaper=Smithsonian |access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plant]] hybridization is more commonplace compared to animal hybridization. Many [[crop]] species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid [[wheat]]s: some have four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most [[eukaryotic]] organisms) two sets ([[diploid]]), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.&lt;ref name=Hancock&gt;{{cite book |author=Hancock, James F. |date=2004 |title=Plant Evolution and the Origin of Crop Species |publisher=CABI Publishing |isbn=978-0-85199-685-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/plantevolutionor0000hanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybridization may be important in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not increasing the number of sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new [[Eukaryote hybrid genome|hybrid genome]] can remain stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Rieseberg, Loren H. | title=Hybrid Origins of Plant Species | journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | date=1997 | volume=28 |pages=359–389 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.28.1.359 | citeseerx=10.1.1.718.9871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[hybrid zone]]s are known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are continually produced in great numbers. These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems for studying the mechanisms of speciation. Recently DNA analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in the [[North West Territories]] confirmed the existence of naturally-occurring and fertile [[grizzly–polar bear hybrid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hybrid bear shot dead in Canada |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4766217.stm |work=BBC News |date=13 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid vigour===
[[File:Salvia jurisicii x nutans - Flickr - peganum.jpg|thumb|[[Heterosis|Hybrid vigour]]: ''Salvia jurisicii x nutans'' hybrids (top centre, with flowers) are taller than their parents ''[[Salvia jurisicii]]'' (centre tray) or ''[[Salvia nutans]]'' (top left).]]
{{Main|Heterosis}}

Hybridization between reproductively isolated species often results in hybrid offspring with lower fitness than either parental. However, hybrids are not, as might be expected, always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger or perform better than either parental lineage or variety, a phenomenon called [[heterosis|heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage]]. This is most common with plant hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Evaluating the utility of Arabidopsis thaliana as a model for understanding heterosis in hybrid crops |journal=Euphytica |volume=156 |issue=1–2 |date=July 2007 |doi=10.1007/s10681-007-9362-1 |pages=157–171 | last1 = Stokes | first1 = David|s2cid=22964055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Transgressive segregation|transgressive phenotype]] is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Transgressive segregation, adaptation and speciation |journal=Heredity |date=July 1999 |first=Loren H. |last=Rieseberg |pmid=10583537 |author2=Margaret A. Archer |author3=Robert K. Wayne |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=363–372 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6886170|s2cid=2651616 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plant breeding|Plant breeders]] use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid [[maize]] (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. [[Hybrid seed]] dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, C. Wayne |title=Corn: Origin, History, Technology, and Production |publisher=Wiley |date=2004 |page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a hybrid, any trait that falls outside the range of parental variation (and is thus not simply intermediate between its parents) is considered heterotic. ''Positive heterosis'' produces more robust hybrids, they might be stronger or bigger; while the term ''negative heterosis'' refers to weaker or smaller hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McCarthy, Eugene M. |date=2006 |title=Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=17 |isbn=978-0-19-518323-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterosis is common in both animal and plant hybrids. For example, hybrids between a lion and a tigress (&quot;ligers&quot;) are much larger than either of the two progenitors, while &quot;tigons&quot; (lioness × tiger) are smaller. Similarly, the hybrids between the common pheasant (''[[Phasianus colchicus]]'') and domestic fowl (''[[Gallus gallus]]'') are larger than either of their parents, as are those produced between the common pheasant and hen golden pheasant (''[[Chrysolophus pictus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Darwin, Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |year=1868 |title=Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication |volume=II |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurs are absent in hybrids of the former type, although present in both parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spicer, J. W. G. |date=1854 |title=Note on hybrid gallinaceous birds |journal=The Zoologist |volume=12 |pages=4294–4296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human influence==

===Anthropogenic hybridization===

Hybridization is greatly influenced by human impact on the environment,&lt;ref name=A2001&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allendorf |first=Fred W. |author2=Leary, R. F. |author3=Spruell, P. |author4=Wenburg, J. K. |title=The problems with hybrids: setting conservation guidelines |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |date=2001 |volume=16 |issue=11 |pages=613–622|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02290-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; through effects such as [[habitat fragmentation]] and species introductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ehrlich |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Ehrlich |author2=John Holdren |title=Impact of population Growth |journal=Science |date=26 March 1971 |volume=171 |pages=1212–1216 |doi=10.1126/science.171.3977.1212 |issue=3977 |pmid=5545198|bibcode=1971Sci...171.1212E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such impacts make it difficult to [[conservation genetics|conserve the genetics]] of populations undergoing [[introgression|introgressive hybridization]]. Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as [[biological control]], and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vitousek |first=Peter |display-authors=etal |title=Introduced Species: A Significant Component of Human-cause Global Change |journal=New Zealand Journal of Ecology |year=1997 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
[[File:Aquilegia pubescens-formosa hybrid-swarm flowers close.jpg|thumb|Examples of hybrid flowers from [[hybrid swarm]]s of ''[[Aquilegia pubescens]]'' and ''[[Aquilegia formosa]]'']]

There is a kind of continuum with three semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and [[hybrid swarm]]s (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within [[wildlife management]] and habitat management. [[Global warming|Global climate change]] is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.&lt;ref name=A2001/&gt;

Conservationists disagree on when is the proper time to give up on a population that is becoming a hybrid swarm, or to try and save the still existing pure individuals. Once a population becomes a complete mixture, the goal becomes to conserve those hybrids to avoid their loss. Conservationists treat each case on its merits, depending on detecting hybrids within the population. It is nearly impossible to formulate a uniform hybridization policy, because hybridization can occur beneficially when it occurs &quot;naturally&quot;, and when hybrid swarms are the only remaining evidence of prior species, they need to be conserved as well.&lt;ref name=A2001/&gt;

===Genetic mixing and extinction===
{{Main|Genetic pollution}}
{{further|Genetic mixing|Introgression}}

Regionally developed [[ecotype]]s can be threatened with [[extinction]] when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype. This is sometimes called genetic mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mooney |first1=H. A. |last2=Cleland |first2=E. E. |year=2001 |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species |journal=PNAS |volume=98 |issue=10 |pages=5446–5451 |doi=10.1073/pnas.091093398 |pmid=11344292 |pmc=33232|bibcode=2001PNAS...98.5446M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hybridization and introgression, which can happen in natural and hybrid populations, of new genetic material can lead to the replacement of local [[genotypes]] if the hybrids are more [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] and have breeding advantages over the indigenous ecotype or species. These hybridization events can result from the introduction of non-native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing can be especially detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population to such a degree that none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rhymer |first1=J. M. |last2=Simberloff |first2=D. |year=1996 |title=Extinction by Hybridization and Introgression |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=27 |pages=83–109 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.27.1.83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potts, Brad M.; Barbour, Robert C.; Hingston, Andrew B.

===Effect on biodiversity and food security===
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|The [[Green Revolution]] of the 20th century relied on hybridization to create [[high-yielding varieties]], along with increased reliance on inputs of [[fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s, and [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farmer |first=B. H. |year=1986 |title= Perspectives on the 'Green Revolution' in South Asia |journal=Modern Asian Studies |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=175–199 |doi=10.1017/s0026749x00013627}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Biodiversity|Food security}}

In agriculture and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]]'s use of conventional hybridization increased yields by breeding &quot;[[high-yielding varieties]]&quot;. The replacement of locally indigenous breeds, compounded with unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding (genetic mixing), has reduced the gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds resulting in the loss of [[genetic diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html &quot;Genetic Pollution: The Great Genetic Scandal&quot;] Devinder Sharma {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518120050/http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html |date=18 May 2009}}; Bulletin 28&lt;/ref&gt; Since the indigenous breeds are often well-adapted to local extremes in climate and have immunity to local pathogens, this can be a significant genetic erosion of the gene pool for future breeding. Therefore, commercial plant geneticists strive to breed &quot;widely adapted&quot; cultivars to counteract this tendency.&lt;ref&gt;Troyer, A. Forrest.

{{further|List of plant hybrids}}

Plant species hybridize more readily than animal species, and the resulting hybrids are fertile more often. Many plant species are the result of hybridization, combined with [[polyploidy]], which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goulet2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goulet |first1=Benjamin E. |last2=Roda |first2=Federico |last3=Hopkins |first3=Robin |title=Hybridization in Plants: Old Ideas, New Techniques |journal=Plant Physiology |date=2016 |volume=173 |issue=1 |pages=65–78 |doi=10.1104/pp.16.01340 |pmid=27895205 |pmc=5210733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant species that are genetically compatible may not hybridize in nature for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in flowering period, or differences in [[pollinator]]s. Species that are brought together by humans in gardens may hybridize naturally, or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts, such as altered flowering period or artificial pollination. Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that have some of the characteristics of each of the parent species. Much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild relatives to improve disease-resistance or [[climate resilience]] for both agricultural and horticultural crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Warschefsky |first1=E. |last2=Penmetsa |first2=R.

Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid is often a result of chromosome number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, which leaves them unable to produce chromosomally-balanced [[gametes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/MCDB2150Fall/notes00/L0033.html|title=University of Colorado Principles of Genetics (MCDB 2150) Lecture 33: Chromosomal changes: Monosomy, Trisomy, Polyploidy, Structural Changes|publisher=[[University of Colorado]]|date=21 November 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014211310/http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/MCDB2150Fall/notes00/L0033.html|archivedate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless, it is an attractive attribute in some fruits.

{{main |Interbreeding between archaic and modern humans}}&lt;!--for image, see that article--&gt;

There is evidence of hybridisation between modern humans and other species of the genus ''[[Homo]]''. In 2010, the [[Neanderthal genome project]] showed that 1–4% of DNA from all people living today, apart from most [[Sub-Saharan African]]s, is of Neanderthal heritage.

The sphinx, which in its Greek form has the face of a woman and the body of a lion with wings, represents the cunning, trickster side of humans. Sophocles' Oedipus narratives highlight this trait when the sphinx of Thebes poses a riddle that appears unsolvable but is solved by Oedipus. The manticore has the head of a human with three rows of shark-like teeth, a body of a lion, and a tail with venomous spines similar to porcupine quills or a scorpion-like tail. The manticore portrays the bestial and vicious nature of humans. In the [[Book of Revelation]], hybrids portray what this world would look like if evil gained the upper hand and reigned uncontested. Specifically, the locusts of Revelation 9 are human-animal hybrids released from the abyss (the demonic underworld) and represent the reverse side of this world. Their destructive nature portrays what this world would be like if God allowed demonic powers to have free, unrestrained reign.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Koester, ''Revelation and the End of All Things'', 2nd ed.

In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''hybrid balance''' is an expression of the degree of electrical symmetry between two [[impedance matching|impedances]] connected to two conjugate sides of a [[hybrid coil]] or [[resistance hybrid]]. It is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]]. 

If the respective impedances of the branches of the hybrid that are connected to the conjugate sides of the hybrid are known, hybrid balance may be computed by the formula for [[return loss]].

[[File:HybridConjugate.jpg|thumb|120px|W and Y, X and Z are conjugate pairs]]

A '''hybrid coil''' (or '''bridge transformer''', or sometimes '''hybrid''') is a [[transformer]] that has three windings, and which is designed to be configured as a [[electrical network|circuit]] having four [[port (circuit theory)|ports]] that are conjugate in pairs.

A signal arriving at one port is divided equally between the two adjacent ports but does not appear at the opposite port. In the schematic diagram, the signal into W  splits between X and Z, and no signal passes to Y. Similarly, signals into X split to W and Y with none to Z, etc.

Correct operation requires matched [[characteristic impedance]] at all four ports.  Hybrids are a class of [[directional coupler]] in which the input port power is split equally between the two output ports.  Forms of hybrid other than transfomer coils are possible; any format of directional coupler can be designed to be a hybrid.  These formats include [[transmission line]]s and [[waveguide]]s.

== Explanation ==
[[File:TwoWireRepeater.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Using hybrids for bidirectional amplification]]The primary use of a [[voiceband]] hybrid coil is to convert between [[Two-wire circuit|2-wire]] and [[Four-wire circuit|4-wire]] operation in sequential sections of a [[information transfer|communications]] circuit, for example in a [[four-wire terminating set]].  Such conversion was necessary when [[repeater]]s were introduced in a 2-wire circuit, a frequent practice at early 20th century [[telephony]].  Without hybrids, the output of one amplifier feeds directly into the input of the other, resulting in a howling situation (upper diagram). By using hybrids, the outputs and inputs are isolated, resulting in correct 2-wire repeater operation. Late in the century, this practice became rare but hybrids continued in use in [[line card]]s.

===Hybrid coil circuit diagrams===
Hybrids are realized using [[transformer]]s. Two versions of transformer hybrids were used, the single transformer version providing unbalanced outputs with one end [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]], and the double transformer version providing [[Balanced circuit|balanced ports]]. [[Image:DoubleTransformerHybrid.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Wiring diagram of a double transformer hybrid]]

====Single transformer hybrid====
[[File:SingleTransformerHybrid.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Wiring diagram of a single transformer hybrid]]For use in [[Two-wire circuit|2-wire]] [[repeater]]s, the single transformer version suffices, since amplifiers in the repeaters have grounded inputs and outputs. X, Y, and Z share a [[Ground (electricity)|common ground]]. As shown at left, signal into W, the 2-wire port, will appear at X and Z. But since Y is bridged from center of coil to center of X and Z, no signal appears. Signal into X will appear at W and Y. But signal at Z is the difference of what appears at Y and, through the transformer coil, at W, which is zero. Similar reasoning proves both pairs, W &amp; Y, X &amp; Z, are conjugates.

====Double transformer hybrid====
When both the [[Two-wire circuit|2-wire]] and the [[Four-wire circuit|4-wire circuits]] must be [[Balanced circuit|balanced]], double transformer hybrids are used, as shown at right. Signal into port W splits between X and Z, but due to reversed connection to the windings, cancel at port Y. Signal into port X goes to W and Y. But due to reversed connection to ports W and Y, Z gets no signal. Thus the pairs, W &amp; Y, X &amp; Z, are conjugates.

== Applications ==
[[Telephone hybrid]]s are used in [[telephone exchange]]s to convert the 4-wire appearance to the 2-wire [[last mile]] connection to the subscriber's [[telephone]].  A different kind of hybrid is used in telephone [[handset]]s to convert the four wires of the transmitter (earpiece) and receiver (microphone) to the 2-wire line connection.  This kind of hybrid is more commonly called an '''induction coil''' due to its derivation from high-voltage [[induction coil]]s.  It does not produce a high voltage, but like the high-voltage variety, it is a [[step-up transformer]] in order to [[impedance matching|impedance match]] the low-impedance [[Carbon microphone|carbon button transmitter]] to the higher impedance parts of the system.  The simple induction coil later evolved into a form of hybrid as a [[sidetone]] reduction measure, or volume of microphone output that was fed back to the earpiece. Without this, the phone user's own voice would be louder in the earpiece than the other party's.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Carr, Steve Winder, Stephen Bigelow, ''Understanding Telephone Electronics'', pp. 68-70, Newnes, 2001 {{ISBN|0080520030}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Coe, ''The Telephone and Its Several Inventors: A History'', pp. 124, 173, McFarland, 2006 {{ISBN|0786426098}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the transformer version of the hybrid has been replaced by [[Power dividers and directional couplers#6 dB resistive bridge hybrid|resistor networks]] and compact IC versions, which use [[integrated circuit]] electronics to do the job of the hybrid coil.

Radio-frequency hybrids are used to split radio signals, including television.  The splitter divides the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] signal to feed multiple receivers.

      <text bytes="12311" xml:space="preserve">An '''identifier''' is a name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique object or a unique ''class'' of objects, where the &quot;object&quot; or class may be an idea, physical [countable] object (or class thereof), or physical [noncountable] substance (or class thereof). The abbreviation '''ID''' often refers to identity, identification (the process of identifying), or an identifier (that is, an instance of identification). An identifier may be a word, number, letter, symbol, or any combination of those.

The words, numbers, letters, or symbols may follow an encoding system (wherein letters, digits, words, or symbols ''stand for'' (represent) ideas or longer names) or they may simply be arbitrary. When an identifier follows an encoding system, it is often referred to as a '''code''' or '''nbsp;code'''.  For instance th metadata registry standard defines a code as ''system of valid symbols that substitute for longer values'' in contrast to identifiers without symbolic meaning. Identifiers that do not follow any encoding scheme are often said to be '''arbitrary&amp;nbsp;IDs'''; they are arbitrarily assigned and have no greater meaning. (Sometimes identifiers are called &quot;codes&quot; even when they are actually arbitrary, whether because the speaker believes that they have deeper meaning or simply because they are speaking casually and imprecisely.)

The unique identifier ('''UID''') is an identifier that refers to ''only one instance''—only one particular object in the universe. A part number is an identifier, but it is not a ''unique'' identifier—for that, a serial number is needed, to identify ''each instance'' of the part design. Thus the ''identifier'' &quot;Model&amp;nbsp;T&quot; identifies the ''class'' ''(model)'' of automobiles that Ford's Model&amp;nbsp;T comprises; whereas the ''unique identifier'' &quot;Model&amp;nbsp;T&amp;nbsp;Serial Number&amp;nbsp;159,862&quot; identifies one specific member of that class—that is, one particular Model&amp;nbsp;T car, owned by one specific person.

The concepts of ''name'' and ''identifier'' are denotatively equal, and the terms are thus denotatively [[synym]]ous; but they are not always [[cotation|connotatively]] synonymous, because '''[[ode name]]s''' and '''ID numbers''' are often connotatively distinguished from names in the sense of traditionaural language]] naming. For example, both Zawinski]]&quot; and &quot;[[Netscape]] employee number 20&quot; are identifiers for the same specific c]] one.

==Metadata==
In [[metadata]], an identifier is a language-independent label, sign or token that uniquely identifies an object within an [[identification scheme]]. The suffix &quot;identifier&quot; is also used as a [[representation term]] when naming a [[data element]].

ID codes may inherently carry [[metadata]] along with them. For example, when you know that the food package in front of you has the identifier &quot;2011-09-25T15:42Z-MFR5-P02-243-45&quot;, you not only have that data, you also have the metadata that tells you that it was packaged on September 25, 2011, at 3:42pm UTC, manufactured by Licensed Vendor Number 5, at the Peoria, IL, USA plant, in Building 2, and was the 243rd package off the line in that shift, and was inspected by Inspector Number 45.

Arbitrary identifiers might lack metadata. For example, if a food package just says 100054678214, its ID may not tell anything except identity—no date, manufacturer name, production sequence rank, or inspector number. In some cases, arbitrary identifiers such as sequential serial numbers leak information (i.e. the [[German tank problem]]). Opaque identifiers—identifiers designed to avoid leaking even that small amount of information—include &quot;really [[opaque pointer]]s&quot; and [[universally unique identifier#Version 4 (random)|Version 4 UUIDs]].

== In computer science ==
&lt;!-- [[Identifier (computer science)]] redirects here --&gt;

In [[computer science]], identifiers (IDs) are [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] [[Token (parser)|tokens]] that name [[Entity class|entities]]. Identifiers are used extensively in virtually all [[information processing system]]s. Identifying entities makes it possible to refer to them, which is essential for any kind of symbolic processing.

=== In computer languages ===
{{main article|Identifier (computer languages)}}
In [[computer language]]s, identifiers are [[Token (parser)|tokens]] (also called [[symbol]]s) which name language entities. Some of the kinds of entities an identifier might denote include [[variable (programming)|variables]], [[data type|types]], [[label (programming language)|labels]], [[subroutine]]s,  and [[modular programming|packages]].

== Ambiguity ==

===Identifiers (IDs) versus Unique identifiers (UIDs)===
{{main article|Unique identifier}}
Many resources may carry multiple identifiers. Typical examples are:
* One person with multiple names, nicknames, and forms of address (titles, salutations)
** ''For example:'' One specific person may be identified by all of the following identifiers: Jane&amp;nbsp;Smith; Jane&amp;nbsp;Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;Meredith&amp;nbsp;Smith; Jane&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Smith; Jane&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Smith; Janie&amp;nbsp;Smith; Janie; Little&amp;nbsp;Janie (as opposed to her mother or sister or cousin, Big&amp;nbsp;Janie); Aunt&amp;nbsp;Jane; Auntie&amp;nbsp;Janie; Mom; Grandmom; Nana; Kelly's&amp;nbsp;mother; Billy's&amp;nbsp;grandmother; Ms.&amp;nbsp;Smith; Dr.&amp;nbsp;Smith; Jane&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Smith,&amp;nbsp;PhD; and Fuzzy (her jocular nickname at work).
* One document with multiple versions&lt;ref name=paid&gt;{{cite web
  | last = [[University of Glasgow]]
  | title = Procedure for Applying Identifiers to Documents
  | url = http://www.gla.ac.uk/infostrat/ERM/Docs/procref.htm
  | accessdate = 28 April 2009
  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605081415/http://www.gla.ac.uk/infostrat/ERM/Docs/procref.htm
  | archive-date = 5 June 2011
  | url-status = dead
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One substance with multiple names (for example, [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS]] index names versus [[IUPAC]] names;&lt;ref name=icn&gt;{{cite web
  | last = [[University of Pennsylvania]]
  | title = Information on Chemical Nomenclature
  | url = http://gethelp.library.upenn.edu/guides/scitech/chemnom.html
  | accessdate = 28 April 2009
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] generic drug names versus [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]] generic drug names versus brand names)

The inverse is also possible, where multiple resources are represented with the same identifier (discussed below).

===Implicit context and namespace conflicts===
{{see also|Naming collision}}
Many [[code]]s and [[nomenclature|nomenclatural]] systems originate within a small [[namespace]]. Over the years, some of them bleed into larger namespaces (as people interact in ways they formerly hadn't, e.g., cross-border trade, scientific collaboration, military alliance, and general cultural interconnection or assimilation). When such dissemination happens, the limitations of the original naming convention, which had formerly been latent and moot, become painfully apparent, often necessitating [[retronym]]y, [[synonym]]ity,
translation/[[transcoding]], and so on. Such limitations generally accompany the shift away from the original context to the broader one. Typically the system shows implicit context (context was formerly assumed, and narrow), lack of capacity (e.g., low number  of possible IDs, reflecting the outmoded narrow context), lack of [[extensibility]] (no features defined and reserved against future needs), and lack of specificity and disambiguating capability (related to the context shift, where longstanding uniqueness encounters novel nonuniqueness). Within computer science, this problem is called [[naming collision]]. The story of the origination and expansion of the [[CODEN]] system provides a good case example in a recent-decades, technical-nomenclature context. The capitalization variations seen with [[proper noun#Specific designators|specific designators]] reveals an instance of this problem occurring in [[natural language]]s, where the proper&amp;nbsp;noun/common&amp;nbsp;noun distinction (and its complications) must be dealt with. A universe in which every object had a UID would not need any namespaces, which is to say that it would constitute one gigantic namespace; but human minds could never keep track of, or semantically interrelate, so many UIDs.

In [[telecommunication]]s and [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] design, an '''image antenna''' is an electrical mirror-image of an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] element formed by the radio waves reflecting from a conductive surface called a [[ground plane]], such as the surface of the earth. It is used as a geometrical technique in calculating the [[radiation pattern]] of the antenna.

When a radio antenna is mounted above a conductive surface such as the [[ground (electricity)|earth]], the radio waves directed down toward the surface reflect off it.  The radiation received at a distant point is the sum of two contributions: the waves that travel directly from the antenna to the point, and the waves that reach the point after reflecting off the ground plane.  Because of the reflection, these second waves appear to come from a second antenna behind the plane, just as a visible object in front of a flat [[mirror]] forms a [[virtual image]] that seems to lie behind the mirror.  The [[radiation pattern]] of the antenna is exactly the same as it would be if the ground plane were replaced by a mirror image of the antenna, located an equal distance behind the plane.   This second apparent source of radio waves is the image antenna.

The image antenna is used in calculating [[electric field]] vectors, [[magnetic field]] vectors, and [[electromagnetic field]]s emanating from the real antenna, particularly in the vicinity of the antenna and along the ground. Each charge and current in the real antenna has its counterpart in the image, and may also be considered as a source of [[radiation]].  

To form an image of the antenna above it, the [[ground plane]] need not be grounded to the Earth.  Many antenna types, such as [[reflective array antenna]]s, use flat surfaces of metal or metal screen to reflect radio waves from the antenna elements, and these can be analyzed using image antennas.  If there is more than one reflective surface in the antenna, as in a [[corner reflector]] antenna, each surface forms its own image of the antenna elements.    In order to form an image, the ground plane surface must generally have dimensions of at least a quarter-[[wavelength]] of the radio waves used.

      <text bytes="6973" xml:space="preserve">In [[optics]], an '''index-matching material''' is a substance, usually a liquid, cement (adhesive), or [[gel]], which has an [[index of refraction]] that closely approximates that of another object (such as a lens, material, fiber-optic, etc.).

When two substances with the same index are in contact, light passes from one to the other with neither [[fresnel reflection|reflection]] nor [[refraction]]. As such, they are used for various purposes in science, engineering, and art.

For example, in a popular home experiment, a glass rod is made almost invisible by immersing it in an index-matched transparent fluid such as [[mineral spirits]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optics4kids.org/home/content/classroom-activities/medium/lose-a-glass-in-a-glass/ Optics For Kids - &quot;Lose a glass in a glass&quot; home experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In microscopy==
{{main|Oil immersion}}

In [[optical microscope|light microscopy]], oil immersion is a technique used to increase the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of a [[microscope]]. This is achieved by immersing both the [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] and the specimen in a transparent oil of high [[refractive index]], thereby increasing the [[numerical aperture]] of the objective lens.

Immersion oils are transparent oils that have specific optical and [[viscosity]] characteristics necessary for use in microscopy. Typical oils used have an [[index of refraction]] around  1.515.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympusmicro.com/primer/anatomy/immersion.html &quot;Microscope Objectives: Immersion Media&quot;] by Mortimer Abramowitz  and Michael W. Davidson, ''[[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] Microscopy Resource Center'' (website), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; An oil immersion objective is an objective lens specially designed to be used in this way. The index of the oil is typically chosen to match the index of the microscope lens glass, and of the [[cover slip]].

For more details, see the main article, [[oil immersion]]. Some microscopes also use other index-matching materials besides oil; see [[water immersion objective]] and [[solid immersion lens]].

==In fiber optics==
In fiber optics and [[telecommunications]], an index-matching material may be used in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see [[Optical fiber connector]]). Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as −14&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] (i.e., 14&amp;nbsp;dB below the optical power of the incident [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]]). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is 28&amp;nbsp;dB plus twice the fiber loss below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog [[baseband]] [[Amplitude|intensity]]-modulated [[video]] signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital [[optical receiver]] except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a [[Distributed Feedback Laser]] may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as Side Mode Suppression Ratio, potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as −10&amp;nbsp;dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.

For some applications, instead of standard polished connectors (e.g. FC/PC), angle polished connectors (e.g. FC/APC) may be used, whereby the non-perpendicular polish angle greatly reduces the ratio of reflected signal launched into the guided mode even in the case of a fiber-air interface.

==In experimental fluid dynamics==
{{main|Fluid dynamics}}

Index matching is used in liquid-liquid and liquid-solid ([[Multiphase flow]]) experimental systems to minimise the distortions that occur in these systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A review of solid–fluid selection options for optical-based measurements in single-phase liquid, two-phase liquid–liquid and multiphase solid–liquid flows|authors=Wright, S.F., Zadrazil, I. &amp; Markides, C.N.|journal=Experiments in Fluids |year=2017|volume=58 |issue=9|pages=108|bibcode=2017ExFl...58..108W|doi=10.1007/s00348-017-2386-y|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is particularly important for systems with many interfaces which become optically inaccessible. Matching the refractive index minimises [[reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], [[diffraction]] and rotations that occurs at the interfaces allowing access to regions that would otherwise be inaccessible to optical measurements. This is particularly important for advanced optical measurements like [[Laser-induced fluorescence]], [[Particle image velocimetry]] and [[Particle tracking velocimetry]] to name a few.

==In art conservation==
{{see also|Conservation and restoration of glass objects}}
If a sculpture is broken into several pieces, [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|art conservators]] may reattach the pieces using an adhesive such as [[Paraloid B-72]] or [[epoxy]]. If the sculpture is made of a transparent or semitransparent material (such as glass), the seam where the pieces are attached will usually be much less noticeable if the refractive index of the adhesive matches the refractive index of the surrounding object. Therefore, art conservators may measure the index of objects and then use an index-matched adhesive. Similarly, losses (missing sections) in transparent or semitransparent objects are often filled using an index-matched material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Controlling the refractive index of epoxy adhesives |authors=John M. Messinger and Peter T. Lansbury |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic28-02-006.html |journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation |year=1989 |volume=28 |number=2 |pages=127–136|doi=10.2307/3179485 |jstor=3179485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In optical component adhesives==
Certain optical components, such as a [[Wollaston prism]] or [[Nicol prism]], are made of multiple transparent pieces that are directly attached to each other. The adhesive is usually index-matched to the pieces. Historically, [[Canada balsam]] was used in this application, but it is now more common to use [[epoxy]] or other synthetic adhesives.

[[File: Coupling Coefficient.gif|thumb|300px|k is the [[Inductance#Coupling coefficient|coupling coefficient]], Le1 and Le2 is the [[leakage inductance]], M1 (M2) is the mutual inductance]]
[[File:Lamp powered by induction 1910.jpg|thumb|Example of inductive coupling, 1910. The bottom coil is connected to AC power. The alternating magnetic field through the top coil induces current in it which lights the lamp.]]

In [[electrical engineering]], two [[electrical_conductor|conductors]] are said to be '''inductively coupled''' or '''magnetically coupled''' &lt;ref&gt;Zverev, A.I.:&quot;Handbook of filter synthesis&quot;. Wiley New York, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; when they are configured such that a change in current through one wire [[Faraday's law of induction|induces]] a voltage across the ends of the other wire through [[electromagnetic induction]].  A changing current through the first wire creates a changing [[magnetic field]] around it by [[Ampere's circuital law]].  The changing magnetic field induces an [[electromotive force]] (EMF or [[voltage]]) in the second wire by [[Faraday's law of induction]].  The amount of inductive coupling between two conductors is measured by their [[mutual inductance]].  

The coupling between two wires can be increased by winding them into [[electromagnetic coil|coils]] and placing them close together on a common axis, so the magnetic field of one coil passes through the other coil.  Coupling can also be increased by a [[magnetic core]] of a [[ferromagnetic]] material like iron or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] in the coils, which increases the magnetic flux.   The two coils may be physically contained in a single unit, as in the primary and secondary windings of a [[Transformer types#.27Interstage.27 and coupling transformers|transformer]], or may be separated.  Coupling may be intentional or unintentional. Unintentional inductive coupling can cause signals from one circuit to be induced into a nearby circuit, this is called [[crosstalk|cross-talk]], and is a form of [[electromagnetic interference]].

An inductively coupled [[transponder]] consists of a solid state [[transceiver]] chip connected to a large coil that functions as an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]].  When brought within the oscillating magnetic field of a reader unit, the transceiver is powered up by energy inductively coupled into its antenna and transfers data back to the reader unit inductively.  

Magnetic coupling between two [[magnet]]s can also be used to mechanically transfer power without contact, as in the [[magnetic gear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://machinedesign.com/motorsdrives/could-magnetic-gears-make-wind-turbines-say-goodbye-mechanical-gearboxes|title= Could Magnetic Gears Make Wind Turbines Say Goodbye to Mechanical Gearboxes? |publisher=machinedesign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Inductive coupling is widely used throughout electrical technology; examples include:
* [[Electric motor]]s and [[Electrical generator|generators]]
* [[Inductive charging]] products
* [[Induction cooker]]s and [[induction heating]] systems
* [[Induction loop]] communication systems
* [[Metal detectors]]
* [[Radio-frequency identification]]
* [[Transformer]]s
* [[Wireless power transfer#Inductive coupling|Wireless power transfer]]

==Low-frequency induction==
Low-frequency induction can be a dangerous form of inductive coupling when it happens inadvertently. For example, if metal long-distance [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] is installed along a [[right of way]] in parallel with a high-voltage power line, the power line can induce current on the pipe. Since the pipe is a conductor, insulated by its protective coating from the earth, it acts as a secondary winding for a long, drawn out transformer whose primary winding is the power line. Voltages induced on the pipe are then a hazard to people operating valves or otherwise touching metal parts of the metal pipeline.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Reducing low-frequency magnetic fields may be necessary when dealing with electronics, as sensitive circuits in close proximity to an instrument with a power transformer could begin to display 60Hz pickup. Twisted wires are an effective way of reducing the interference as signals induced in the successive twists cancel. Using magnetic shielding is also an effective way of reducing unwanted inductive coupling, though moving the source of the magnetic field away from sensitive electronics is the simplest solution if possible. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Paul |last2=Hill |first2=Winfield |title=The Art of Electronics Second Edition |date=1989 |publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Caimbridge |isbn=0521370957 |page=456 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Art-Electronics-Paul-Horowitz/dp/0521370957 |accessdate=19 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although induced currents can be harmful, they can also be helpful. Electrical distribution line engineers use inductive coupling to tap power for cameras on towers and at substations that allow remote monitoring of the facilities. Using this they can watch from anywhere and not need to worry about changing camera batteries or solar panel maintenance.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In [[telecommunication]]s, an '''information-bearer channel''' is one of: 

#A [[communication channel]] capable of transmitting all the [[information]] required for communication, such as [[User (telecommunications)|user]] [[data]], [[synchronizing]] sequences, and control signals. The information-bearer channel may operate at a higher data rate than that required for user data alone. 
#A basic [[telecommunication|communications]] channel with the [[necessary bandwidth]] but without enhanced or value-added services.

A transaction is a change of state, an '''information-transfer transaction''' is a transaction in which one of the following changes occurs: content, ownership, location, format, etc. An information-transfer transaction usually consists of three consecutive phases called the [[access phase]], the [[information transfer]] phase, and the [[disengagement phase]]. Examples of these consecutive phases are the copying and transporting of information. Once a transaction occurs there are also costs to consider, which are associated with that certain transaction. When it comes to the transfer of information some [[transaction cost]]s include time and means (money).

==History of Information-transfer transactions==
There are many social systems and devices that have contributed to information-transfer transactions; starting from people writing letters using postal systems to emailing using [[information technology]]. Two main examples of information-transfer transactions technology development is the copying and transportation of information.

==History of Copying==
{{Main|Copying}}
Copying is the process of duplicating information with the change of location or format of the original information. The transfer transaction of information through copying has been going on for ages and there has been many advances in technology to decrease the time it takes to make copies of said information. The art of copying started with people having to write a copy out by hand, then the [[printing press]], all the way to [[digital copying]] with [[ICTs]]. These developments lead to quicker information-transfer transactions in the form of distributing copies of original information to others through a changes of location or format.

==History of Transporting==
{{Main|Transport}}
Transporting is the movement of information with the change of location or ownership of the original information. The transfer transaction of information through transporting has been going on for ages and there has been social and technological developments to decrease the time it takes for information to change ownership or location.  The transportation of information started with people sending letters by foot, then by horse, the public and international postal service, all the way down to technology networks. It is these developments which led to the ability to send information further and quicker through information-transfer transactions.

==Transaction Costs==
{{Main|Transaction cost}}
Every time a transaction occurs, there are always costs to be considered. In the case of information-transfer transactions, one most consider the costs of time and means (money). Both of these costs are corollated with one another in that to decrease one, you must increase the other.  For example, say Person #1 sends a letter through the [[mail]], while Person #2 sends letters through [[email]]. For Person #1 to send their letter they had to buy paper, means of writing, envelopes, stamps, etc., while Person #2 needed to buy a source of electricity, internet, computer technology, etc. to send an email. It seems like Person #1 has lower transaction costs then Person #2 in terms of means; however, when you look at both information-transfer transactions in terms of time that is a different story. For Person #1 although they had little costs in sending their letter, the time it takes for the transfer of that letter is about 3+ days, while Person #2's transfer through email happens in less than minutes, but they endured high mean costs. Therefore, for information-transfer transaction times to decrease, the costs of means have to increase and vice versa.

==Telecommunication==
In [[telecommunication]], an '''information-transfer transaction''' is a coordinated [[sequence]] of [[User (telecommunications)|user]] and [[telecommunications system]] actions that cause [[information]] present at a [[source user]] to become present at a destination user.

{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}

In [[telecommunications]], '''insertion loss''' is the loss of [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] [[power (physics)|power]] resulting from the insertion of a device in a [[transmission line]] or [[optical fiber]] and is usually expressed in [[decibel]]s (dB).  

If the power transmitted to the load before insertion is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and the power received by the load after insertion is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, then the insertion loss in dB is given by,

:&lt;math&gt;IL(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm T \over P_\mathrm R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Electronic filters==

Insertion loss is a [[figure of merit]] for an [[electronic filter]] and this data is generally specified with a filter.  Insertion loss is defined as a ratio of the signal level in a test configuration without the filter installed (|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|) to the signal level with the filter installed  (|''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|).  This ratio is described in [[decibel|dB]] by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Insertion loss (dB)} = 10 \log_{10} {\left|V_1\right|^2 \over \left|V_2\right|^2} = 20 \log_{10} {\left|V_1\right| \over \left|V_2\right|}&lt;/math&gt;

For passive filters, |''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;| will be smaller than |''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|. In this case, the insertion loss is positive and measures how much smaller the signal is after adding the filter.

==Link with scattering parameters==

In case the two measurement ports use the same reference impedance, the insertion loss (&lt;math&gt;IL&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Pozar, David M.; ''Microwave Engineering, Third Edition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collin, Robert E.; ''Foundations For Microwave Engineering, Second Edition''&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; IL = -20\log_{10}\left|S_{21}\right| \,\text{dB}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;S_{21}&lt;/math&gt; is one of the [[Scattering parameters#Insertion loss|scattering parameters]]. Insertion loss is the extra loss produced by the introduction of the [[Device under test|DUT]] between the 2 reference planes of the measurement. The extra loss can be introduced by intrinsic loss in the DUT and/or mismatch. In case of extra loss the insertion loss is defined to be positive.

      <text bytes="2941" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]], the term '''inside plant''' has the following meanings:

*All the cabling and equipment installed in a [[telecommunications facility]], including the [[main distribution frame]] (MDF) and all the equipment extending inward therefrom, such as [[PABX]] or [[telephone exchange|central office]] equipment, MDF [[heat coil]] protectors, and grounding systems.  
*In [[radio]] and [[radar]] systems, all [[communications-electronics]] (C-E) equipment that is installed in buildings.

Around the turn of the 21st century, [[DSLAM]]s became an important part of [[telephone company]] inside plant. Inside plant will also have [[distribution frame]]s and other equipment including [[passive optical network]] (name depends on the Service Provider).

==Power==
A typical power system for a switching office in an inside plant consists of the elements listed below: 
*AC power system
**AC input switch gear
**Standby AC plant (where appropriate)
**AC distribution system (essential and non-essential loads)
**AC backup systems for uninterruptible loads and protected loads
*DC power system
**Rectifiers and plant controls
**[[Storage batteries]]
**DC distribution system.
For safety and reliability reasons, it is desirable that all telecommunications loads be DC powered with minimal AC-powered devices used. Telcordia [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-513&amp; GR-513, Power Requirements in Telecommunications Plant (LSSGR Section 13)], contains detailed industry requirements for using power in an inside plant.

Both integrated and isolated bonding networks as per Telcordia [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-295&amp; GR-295, Mesh and Isolated Bonding Networks: Definition and Application to Telephone Central Offices], are a technically viable means to ground and bond the equipment in a safe and effective manner. However, the integrated or mesh bonding schemes are preferred over isolated bonding networks because of the added costs and efforts required to manage, control, and maintain the isolation for the equipment, particularly during equipment upgrade and modifications to the plant. This preference is based on a pragmatic desire for lower costs and ease of management, and to simplify operations during plant modifications/upgrades.

For a comprehensive analysis of the energy efficiency and environmental soundness of a power system, one should ideally consider a wider range of factors than strict energy conversion AC-to-DC power efficiency. These environmental factors cover a wider vision known as [[Industrial Ecology]] within which each manufacturing step of the products need to be considered from a [[Design for Environment]] (DfE) factors standpoint.

The '''Intelligent Network''' ('''IN''') is the standard [[network architecture]] specified in the [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.1200/en/ ITU-T Q.1200 series recommendations].  It is intended for fixed as well as [[Global System for Mobile Communications|mobile]] [[telecommunication|telecom]] networks. It allows operators to differentiate themselves by providing [[value-added service]]s in addition to the standard telecom services such as [[PSTN]], [[ISDN]] on fixed networks, and [[GSM services]] on [[Mobile phone|mobile phones]] or other mobile devices.

The intelligence is provided by network nodes on the [[service layer]], distinct from the [[telephone exchange|switching]] layer of the [[core network]], as opposed to solutions based on intelligence in the core [[telephone exchange|switches]] or equipment. The IN nodes are typically owned by [[telecommunications service provider]]s such as a [[telephone company]] or [[mobile phone operator]].

IN is supported by the [[Signaling System 7|Signaling System #7 (SS7)]] protocol between network switching centers and other network nodes owned by network operators.

==Examples of IN services==

* [[Televoting]]
* [[Call screening]]
* [[Local number portability]]
* [[Toll-free telephone number|Toll-free calls]]/Freephone
* [[Prepaid telephone calls|Prepaid calling]]
* Account card calling
* [[Virtual private network]]s (such as family group calling)
* [[Centrex]] service (Virtual [[Private branch exchange|PBX]])
* Private-number plans (with numbers remaining unpublished in directories)
* [[Universal Personal Telecommunications]] service (a universal personal telephone number)
* Mass-calling service
* Prefix free dialing from cellphones abroad
* Seamless [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] message access from abroad
* [[Collect call|Reverse charging]]
* Home Area Discount
* [[Premium-rate telephone number|Premium Rate]] calls
* [[Call distribution]] based on various criteria associated with the call
** [[Location-based routing]]
** Time-based routing
** Proportional call distribution (such as between two or more call centres or offices)
* Call queueing
* [[Call transfer]]

==History and key concepts==
The IN concepts, architecture and protocols were originally developed as standards by the [[ITU-T]] which is the [[standardization]] committee of the [[International Telecommunication Union]]; prior to this a number of telecommunications providers had proprietary implementations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT4191860 http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT4191860], Early patent for proprietary IN Services&lt;/ref&gt; The primary aim of the IN was to enhance the core telephony services offered by traditional telecommunications networks, which usually amounted to making and receiving voice calls, sometimes with call divert. This core would then provide a basis upon which [[Telephone company|operators]] could build services in addition to those already present on a standard [[Telephone switch|telephone exchange]].

A complete description of the IN emerged in a set of [[ITU-T]] standards named [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.1210/en/ Q.1210] to [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.1219/en/ Q.1219], or Capability Set One (CS-1) as they became known.  The standards defined a complete architecture including the architectural view, state machines, physical implementation and protocols.  They were universally embraced by telecom suppliers and operators, although many variants were derived for use in different parts of the world (see [[#Variants|Variants]] below).

Following the success of CS-1, further enhancements followed in the form of CS-2.  Although the standards were completed, they were not as widely implemented as CS-1, partly because of the increasing power of the variants, but also partly because they addressed issues which pushed traditional telephone exchanges to their limits.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:IntelligentNetwork.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|Intelligent Network schematic diagram]] --&gt;
The major driver behind the development of the IN was the need for a more flexible way of adding sophisticated services to the existing network. Before the IN was developed, all new features and/or services had to be implemented directly in the core switch systems. This made for long release cycles as the software testing had to be extensive and thorough to prevent the network from failing. With the advent of the IN, most of these services (such as toll-free numbers and geographical number portability) were moved out of the core switch systems and into self-contained nodes, creating a modular and more secure network that allowed the service providers themselves to develop variations and value-added services to their networks without submitting a request to the core switch manufacturer and waiting for the long development process. The initial use of IN technology was for number translation services, e.g. when translating toll-free numbers to regular [[PSTN]] numbers; much more complex services have since been built on the IN, such as [[Custom Local Area Signaling Services]] (CLASS) and prepaid telephone calls.

==SS7 architecture==
The main concepts (functional view) surrounding IN services or architecture are connected with [[Signaling System 7|SS7]] architecture:

* ''Service Switching Function'' (SSF) or ''[[Service switching point|Service Switching Point]]'' (SSP) is co-located with the telephone exchange, and acts as the trigger point for further services to be invoked during a call.  The SSP implements the Basic Call State Machine (BCSM) which is a [[Finite state machine]] that represents an abstract view of a call from beginning to end (off hook, dialing, answer, no answer, busy, hang up, etc.).  As each state is traversed, the exchange encounters ''Detection Points (DPs)'' at which the SSP may invoke a query to the SCP to wait for further instructions on how to proceed.  This query is usually called a trigger.  Trigger criteria are defined by the operator and might include the subscriber calling number or the dialed number. The SSF is responsible for controlling calls requiring value added services.
* ''Service Control Function'' (SCF) or ''[[Service control point|Service Control Point]]'' (SCP) is a separate set of platforms that receive queries from the SSP.  The SCP contains service logic which implements the behaviour desired by the operator, i.e., the services.  During service logic processing, additional data required to process the call may be obtained from the SDF.  The logic on the SCP is created using the SCE.
* ''Service Data Function'' (SDF) or ''[[Service data point|Service Data Point]]'' (SDP) is a database that contains additional subscriber data, or other data required to process a call.  For example, the subscriber's remaining prepaid credit may be stored in the SDF to be queried in real-time during the call.  The SDF may be a separate platform or co-located with the SCP.
* ''Service Management Function'' (SMF) or ''Service Management Point'' (SMP) is a platform or cluster of platforms that operators use to monitor and manage the IN services. It contains the management database which stores the services' configuration, collects the statistics and alarms, and stores the Call Data Reports and Event Data Reports.
* ''Service Creation Environment'' (SCE) is the development environment used to create the services present on the SCP.  Although the standards permit any type of environment, it is fairly rare to see low level languages like [[C (programming language)|C]] used.  Instead, proprietary graphical languages are used to enable telecom engineers to create services directly. The languages are usually of the [[Fourth-generation programming language|fourth-generation]] type, and the engineer may use a [[graphical interface]] to build or change a service.
* ''Specialized Resource Function'' (SRF) or ''Intelligent Peripheral'' (IP) is a node which can connect to both the SSP and the SCP and deliver special resources into the call, mostly related to voice communication, for example to play voice announcements or collect [[DTMF]] tones from the user.

==Protocols==
The core elements described above use standard protocols to communicate with each other. The use of standard protocols allows different manufacturers to concentrate on different parts of the architecture and be confident that they will all work together in any combination.

The interfaces between the SSP and the SCP are [[Signalling System No. 7|SS7]] based and have similarities with [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] protocols.  The SS7 protocols implement much of the [[OSI seven-layer model]].  This means that the IN standards only had to define the [[application layer]], which is called the Intelligent Networks Application Part or [[INAP]].  The INAP messages are encoded using [[Abstract syntax notation one|ASN.1]].

The interface between the SCP and the SDP is defined in the standards to be an [[X.500]] Directory Access Protocol or DAP. A more lightweight interface called [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] has emerged from the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] which is considerably simpler to implement, so many SCPs have implemented that instead.

==Variants==
The core CS-1 specifications were adopted and extended by other standards bodies.  European flavours were developed by [[ETSI]], American flavours were developed by [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]], and Japanese variants also exist.  The main reasons for producing variants in each region was to ensure interoperability between equipment manufactured and deployed locally (for example different versions of the underlying SS7 protocols exist between the regions).

New functionality was also added which meant that variants diverged from each other and the main ITU-T standard.  The biggest variant was called [[Customised Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic]], or CAMEL for short.  This allowed for extensions to be made for the [[mobile phone]] environment, and allowed [[mobile phone operator]]s to offer the same IN services to subscribers while they are [[roaming]] as they receive in the home network.

CAMEL has become a major standard in its own right and is currently maintained by [[3GPP]].  The last major release of the standard was CAMEL phase 4.  It is the only IN standard currently being actively worked on.

Bellcore (subsequently [[Telcordia Technologies]]) developed the '''Advanced Intelligent Network''' (AIN) as the variant of Intelligent Network for North America, and performed the standardization of the AIN on behalf of the major US operators. The original goal of AIN was AIN 1.0, which was specified in the early 1990s (''AIN Release 1'', Bellcore SR-NWT-002247, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=SR-NWT-002247&amp; SR-NWT-002247]&lt;/ref&gt; AIN 1.0 proved technically infeasible to implement, which led to the definition of simplified AIN 0.1 and AIN 0.2 specifications.  In North America, Telcordia SR-3511 (originally known as TA-1129+)&lt;ref name=&quot;sr3511&quot;&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=SR-3511&amp; SR-3511]&lt;/ref&gt; and GR-1129-CORE protocols serve to link switches with the IN systems such as [[Service Control Point]]s (SCPs) or Service Nodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;gr1129&quot;&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1129&amp; GR-1129-CORE]&lt;/ref&gt; SR-3511 details a TCP/IP-based protocol which directly connects the SCP and Service Node.&lt;ref name=&quot;sr3511&quot;/&gt;  GR-1129-CORE provides generic requirements for an ISDN-based protocol which connects the SCP to the Service Node via the SSP.&lt;ref name=&quot;gr1129&quot;/&gt;

==Future==
While activity in development of IN standards has declined in recent years, there are many systems deployed across the world which use this technology.  The architecture has proved to be not only stable, but also a continuing source of revenue with new services added all the time.  Manufacturers continue to support the equipment and obsolescence is not an issue.

Nevertheless, new technologies and architectures are emerging, especially in the area of [[VoIP]] and [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]]. More attention is being paid to the use of [[Application programming interface|API]]s in preference to protocols like INAP, and new standards have emerged in the form of [[JAIN]] and [[Parlay X|Parlay]].  From a technical viewpoint, the SCE is beginning to move away from its proprietary graphical origins and is moving towards a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[application server]] environment.

The meaning of &quot;intelligent network&quot; is evolving in time, largely driven by breakthroughs in computation and algorithms. From networks enhanced by more flexible algorithms and more advanced protocols, to networks designed using data-driven models &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/6/790/htm M. Kulin, C.

      <text bytes="2326" xml:space="preserve">In [[optical communications]], '''intensity modulation''' ('''IM''') is a form of [[modulation]] in which the optical [[Power (physics)|power]] output of a source is varied in accordance with some characteristic of the modulating [[Signal (information theory)|signal]].  The envelope of the modulated optical signal is an analog of the modulating signal in the sense that the instantaneous power of the envelope is an analog of the characteristic of interest in the modulating signal. 

Recovery of the modulating signal is usually by direct detection, not [[Heterodyne|heterodyning]].  However, [[optical heterodyne detection]] is possible and has been actively studied since 1979.

An '''interference filter''' or '''[[dichroic filter]]''' is an [[optical filter]] that reflects one or more spectral bands or lines and transmits others, while maintaining a nearly zero coefficient of [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] for all wavelengths of interest. An interference filter may be [[high-pass]], [[low-pass]], [[bandpass]], or band-rejection.

An interference filter consists of multiple thin layers of [[dielectric]] material having different refractive indices. There also may be metallic layers. In its broadest meaning, interference filters comprise also etalons that could be implemented as tunable interference filters. Interference filters are [[wavelength]]-selective by virtue of the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] effects that take place between the incident and reflected waves at the thin-film boundaries. The important characteristic of the filter is the form of the leaving signal. It is considered that the best form is a rectangle.

An '''intermediate distribution frame''' ('''IDF''') is a [[distribution frame]] in a [[telephone exchange|central office]] or [[Customer-premises equipment|customer premises]], which cross connects the [[User (telecommunications)|user]] [[Electrical cable|cable]] media to individual user [[Telecommunication circuit|line circuits]] and may serve as a distribution point for multipair cables from the [[main distribution frame]] (MDF) or [[combined distribution frame]] (CDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from these frames.

IDFs are used for telephone exchange central office, customer-premises equipment, [[wide area network]] (WAN), and [[local area network]] (LAN) environments, among others.

In central office environments the IDF may contain circuit termination equipment from various auxiliary components. In WAN and LAN environments IDFs can hold devices of different types including [[backup]] systems ([[Hard disk drive|hard drives]] or other media as self-contained, or as [[RAID]]s, [[CD-ROM]]s, etc.), [[Computer network|networking]] ([[Network switch|switches]], [[Ethernet hub|hubs]], [[Router (computing)|routers]]), and connections ([[Optical fiber|fiber optics]], [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]], [[Structured cabling|category cables]]) and so on.

[[File:IP spoofing en.svg|thumb|example scenario of IP address spoofing]]
In [[computer networking]], '''IP address spoofing''' or '''IP spoofing''' is the creation of [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] with a false source [[IP address]], for the purpose of impersonating another computing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/ip-spoofing-introduction |title=IP Spoofing: An Introduction |last=Tanase |first=Matthew |publisher=Symantec |date=March 10, 2003 |accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The basic protocol for sending data over the Internet network and many other computer networks is the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP). The protocol specifies that  each IP packet must have a [[Header (computing)|header]] which contains (among other things) the IP address of the sender of the packet. The source IP address is normally the address that the packet was sent from, but the sender's address in the header can be altered, so that to the recipient it appears that the packet came from another source. 

The protocol requires the receiving computer to send back a response to the source IP address, so that spoofing is mainly used when the sender can anticipate the network response or does not care about the response.

The source IP address provides only limited information about the sender. It may provide general information on the region, city and town when on the packet was sent. It does not provide information on the identity of the sender or the computer being used.

==Applications==
IP address spoofing involving the use of a trusted IP address can be used by network intruders to overcome network security measures, such as [[authentication]] based on IP addresses. This type of attack is most effective where trust relationships exist between machines. For example, it is common on some corporate networks to have internal systems trust each other, so that users can log in without a username or password provided they are connecting from another machine on the internal network – which would require them already being logged in. By spoofing a connection from a trusted machine, an attacker on the same network may be able to access the target machine without authentication.

IP address spoofing is most frequently used in [[denial-of-service attack]]s, where the objective is to flood the target with an overwhelming volume of traffic, and the attacker does not care about receiving responses to the attack packets. Packets with spoofed IP addresses are more difficult to filter since each spoofed packet appears to come from a different address, and they hide the true source of the attack. Denial of service attacks that use spoofing typically randomly choose addresses from the entire IP address space, though more sophisticated spoofing mechanisms might avoid non routable addresses or unused portions of the IP address space. The proliferation of large [[botnet]]s makes spoofing less important in denial of service attacks, but attackers typically have spoofing available as a tool, if they want to use it, so defenses against denial-of-service attacks that rely on the validity of the source IP address in attack packets might have trouble with spoofed packets.  [[Denial-of-service attack#Backscatter|Backscatter]], a technique used to observe denial-of-service attack activity in the Internet, relies on attackers' use of IP spoofing for its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=GRIN - Today's Impact on Communication System by IP Spoofing and Its Detection and Prevention|url=https://www.grin.com/document/190620|access-date=2020-07-21|website=www.grin.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legitimate uses==
The use of packets with a false source IP address is not always evidence of malicious intent. For example, in performance testing of websites, hundreds or even thousands of &quot;vusers&quot; (virtual users) may be created, each executing a test script against the website under test, in order to simulate what will happen when the system goes &quot;live&quot; and a large number of users log in simultaneously.

Since each user will normally have its own IP address, commercial testing products (such as [[HP LoadRunner]], [[WebLOAD]], and others) can use IP spoofing, allowing each user its own &quot;return address&quot; as well.

==Services vulnerable to IP spoofing==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Configuration and services that are vulnerable to IP spoofing:

* RPC ([[Remote Procedure Call|Remote procedure call]] services)
* Any service that uses IP address authentication
&lt;!-- * The [[X Window System]]--&gt;
* The R services suite ([[rlogin]], [[Remote Shell|rsh]], etc.)

==Defense against spoofing attacks==
[[Network layer firewall|Packet filtering]] is one defense against IP [[spoofing attack]]s. The gateway to a network usually performs [[ingress filtering]], which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an internal machine. Ideally the gateway would also perform [[egress filtering]] on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a common use of packet filtering, which has been used to secure the environments for sharing data over network and host based IDS approaches. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chaudhary|first1=Manoj|last2=Bharti|first2=Abhishek Kumar|last3=Goyal|first3=Maggi|date=2013|title=A REVIEW ON DETECTION OF SESSION HIJACKING AND IP SPOOFING|url=|journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science|volume=4|issue=9|pages=104–107|via=ProQuest Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also recommended to design network protocols and services so that they do not rely on the source IP address for authentication.

===Upper layers===
Some [[upper layer protocol]]s provide their own defense against IP spoofing attacks. For example, [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) uses sequence numbers negotiated with the remote machine to ensure that arriving packets are part of an established connection. Since the attacker normally cannot see any reply packets, the sequence number must be guessed in order to hijack the connection. The poor implementation in many older operating systems and network devices, however, means that TCP sequence numbers can be predicted.

== Other definitions ==
The term '''''spoofing''''' is also sometimes used to refer to ''header forgery'', the insertion of false or misleading information in [[e-mail spoofing|e-mail]] or [[netnews]] headers. Falsified headers are used to mislead the recipient, or network applications, as to the origin of a message. This is a common technique of [[spamming|spammers]] and [[sporgery|sporgers]], who wish to conceal the origin of their messages to avoid being tracked.

{{Short description|ability of systems to work with each other}}
{{lead too short|date=December 2016}}

'''Interoperability''' is a characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with other products or systems, at present or in the future, in either implementation or access, without any restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |others=Copyright AFUL under CC BY-SA |url=http://interoperability-definition.info/en/ |title=Definition of Interoperability |website=dedicated website for a Definition of Interoperability at interoperability-definition.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term was initially defined for [[information technology]] or [[systems engineering]] services to allow for information exchange,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries. New York, NY: 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; a broader definition takes into account social, political, and organizational factors that impact system to system performance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, T. [http://www.ncoic.org/what-is-interoperability &quot;What is Interoperability?&quot;], [http://www.ncoic.org/ ''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium - NCOIC''], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Hence interoperability involves the task of building coherent services for users when the individual components are technically different and managed by different organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Willium y Arms 2000(afifa iqbal)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
If two or more systems use a common [[File format|data format]]s and [[communication protocol]]s and are capable of communicating with each other, they exhibit ''syntactic interoperability''. [[XML]] and [[SQL]] are examples of common data formats and protocols. Lower-level data formats also contribute to syntactic interoperability, ensuring that alphabetical characters are stored in the same [[ASCII]] or a [[Unicode]] format in all the communicating systems.

Beyond the ability of two or more computer systems to exchange information, [[semantic interoperability]] is the ability to automatically interpret the information exchanged meaningfully and accurately in order to produce useful results as defined by the end users of both systems. To achieve semantic interoperability, both sides must refer to a common information exchange reference model. The content of the information exchange requests are unambiguously defined: what is sent is the same as what is understood. The possibility of promoting this result by user-driven convergence of disparate interpretations of the same information has been the object of study by research prototypes such as [[S3DB]].

[[Cross-domain interoperability]] involves multiple social, organizational, political, legal entities working together for a common interest and/or information exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, T. [https://www.ncoic.org/cross-domain-interoperability &quot;Cross-Domain Interoperability&quot;], [https://www.ncoic.org/home ''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium - NCOIC''], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interoperability and open standards==
Interoperability imply Open standards ''[[ab-initio]],'' i.e. by definition. Interoperability implies exchanges between a range of products, or similar products from several different vendors, or even between past and future revisions of the same product. Interoperability may be developed ''[[wikt:ex post facto|post-facto]]'', as a special measure between two products, while excluding the rest, by using Open standards. When a vendor is forced to adapt its system to a dominant system that is not based on Open standards, it is not interoperability but only [[Computer compatibility|compatibility]].

===Open standards===
{{Main|Open standard}}
Open standards rely on a broadly consultative and inclusive group including representatives from vendors, academics and others holding a stake in the development that discusses and debates the technical and economic merits, demerits and feasibility of a proposed common protocol. After the doubts and reservations of all members are addressed, the resulting common document is endorsed as a ''common standard.'' This document is subsequently released to the public, and henceforth becomes an ''open standard.'' It is usually published and is available freely or at a nominal cost to any and all comers, with ''no further encumbrances.'' Various vendors and individuals (even those who were not part of the original group) can use the standards document to make products that implement the common protocol defined in the standard and are thus '''interoperable by design,''' with no specific liability or advantage for any customer for choosing one product over another on the basis of standardized features. The vendors' products compete on the quality of their implementation, user interface, ease of use, performance, price, and a host of other factors, while keeping the customer's data intact and transferable even if he chooses to switch to another competing product for business reasons.

===''Post facto'' interoperability===
{{Original research|section|date=August 2016}}''Post facto'' interoperability may be the result of the absolute market dominance of a particular product in contravention of any applicable standards, or if any effective standards were not present at the time of that product's introduction. The vendor behind that product can then choose to ''ignore'' any forthcoming standards and not co-operate in any standardization process at all, using its near-monopoly to insist that its product sets the ''de facto'' standard by its very market dominance. This is not a problem if the product's implementation is open ''and'' minimally encumbered, but it may as well be both closed and heavily encumbered (e.g. by patent claims). Because of the [[network effect]], achieving interoperability with such a product is both critical for any other vendor if it wishes to remain relevant in the market, and difficult to accomplish because of lack of co-operation on equal terms with the original vendor, who may well see the new vendor as a potential competitor and threat. The newer implementations often rely on [[clean-room reverse engineering]] in the absence of technical data to achieve interoperability. The original vendors can provide such technical data to others, often in the name of 'encouraging competition,' but such data is invariably encumbered, and may be of limited use. Availability of such data is ''not'' equivalent to an open standard, because:
# The data is provided by the original vendor on a discretionary basis, who has every interest in blocking the effective implementation of competing solutions, and may subtly alter or change its product, often in newer revisions, so that competitors' implementations are almost, but not quite completely interoperable, leading customers to consider them unreliable or of lower quality. These changes can either not be passed on to other vendors at all, or passed on after a strategic delay, maintaining the market dominance of the original vendor.
# The data itself may be encumbered, e.g. by patents or pricing, leading to a dependence of all competing solutions on the original vendor, and possibly leading a revenue stream from the competitors' customers back to the original vendor. This revenue stream is only a result of the original product's market dominance and not a result of any innate superiority.
# Even when the original vendor is genuinely interested in promoting a healthy competition (so that he may also benefit from the resulting innovative market), post-facto interoperability may often be undesirable as many defects or quirks can be directly traced back to the original implementation's technical limitations. Although in an open process, anyone may identify and correct such limitations, and the resulting cleaner specification may be used by all vendors, this is more difficult post-facto, as customers already have valuable information and processes encoded in the faulty but dominant product, and other vendors are forced to replicate those faults and quirks even if they could design better solutions, for the sake of preserving interoperability. Alternatively, it can be argued that even open processes are subject to the weight of past implementations and imperfect past designs and that the power of the dominant vendor to unilaterally correct or improve the system and impose the changes to all users facilitates innovation.
# Lack of an open standard can also become problematic for the customers, as in case of the original vendor's inability to fix a certain problem that is an artifact of technical limitations in the original product. The customer wants that fault fixed, but the vendor has to maintain that faulty state, even across newer revisions of the same product, because that behavior is a de facto standard and many more customers would have to pay the price of any break in interoperability caused by fixing the original problem and introducing new behavior.

== Government ==

=== eGovernment ===
Speaking from an e-government perspective, interoperability refers to the collaboration ability of cross-border services for citizens, businesses and public administrations. Exchanging data can be a challenge due to language barriers, different specifications of formats and varieties of categorizations. Many more hindrances can be identified.

If data is interpreted differently, collaboration is limited, takes longer and is not efficient. For instance, if a citizen of country A wants to purchase land in country B, the person will be asked to submit the proper address data. Address data in both countries include full name details, street name and number as well as a post code. The order of the address details might vary. In the same language, it is not an obstacle to order the provided address data; but across language barriers, it becomes more and more difficult. If the language requires other characters it is almost impossible, if no translation tools are available.

Hence eGovernment applications need to exchange data in a semantically interoperable manner. This saves time and money and reduces sources of errors. Fields of practical use are found in every policy area, be it justice, trade or participation, etc. Clear concepts of interpretation patterns are required.

=== Flood risk management ===
''Interoperability'' is used by researchers in the context of urban flood risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vercruysse|first=Kim|last2=Dawson|first2=David A.|last3=Wright|first3=Nigel|title=Interoperability: A conceptual framework to bridge the gap between multifunctional and multisystem urban flood management|journal=Journal of Flood Risk Management|language=en|volume=0|pages=e12535|doi=10.1111/jfr3.12535|issn=1753-318X|year=2019|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cities and urban areas worldwide are expanding, which creates complex spaces with many interactions between the environment, infrastructure and people.  To address this complexity and manage water in urban areas appropriately, a [[system of systems]] approach to water and [[flood management]] is necessary. In this context, interoperability is important to facilitate system of systems thinking in flood management,  and is defined as: “''the ability of any water management system to redirect water and make use of other system(s) to maintain or enhance its performance function during water exceedance events''”. By assessing the complex properties of urban infrastructure systems, particularly the interoperability between the [[drainage]] systems and other urban systems (e.g. infrastructure such as transport), it could be possible to expand the capacity of the overall system to manage flood water towards achieving improved urban flood resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanfloodresilience.ac.uk/|title=Urban Flood Resilience|website=www.urbanfloodresilience.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military forces===
{{anchor| Military}}
''Force interoperability'' is defined in NATO as the ability of the forces of two or more nations to train, exercise and operate effectively together in the execution of assigned missions and tasks. Additionally NATO defines interoperability more generally as the ability to act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve Allied tactical, operational and strategic objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/aap6/AAP-6.pdf NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions, NATO AAP-06]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the strategic level, interoperability is an enabler for coalition building. It facilitates meaningful contributions by coalition partners. At this level, interoperability issues center on harmonizing the world views, strategies, doctrines, and force structures. Interoperability is an element of coalition willingness to work together over the long term to achieve and maintain shared interests against common threats. Interoperability at the operational and tactical levels is where strategic/political interoperability and technological interoperability come together to help allies shape the environment, manage crises, and win wars. The benefits of interoperability at the operational and tactical levels generally derive from the fungibility or interchangeability of force elements and units. &quot;Technological interoperability&quot; reflects the interfaces between organizations and systems. It focuses on communications and computers but also involves the technical capabilities of systems and the resulting mission compatibility or incompatibility between the systems and data of coalition partners. At the technological level, the benefits of interoperability come primarily from their impacts at the operational and tactical levels in terms of enhancing fungibility and flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;Interoperability: A continuing Challenge in Coalition Air Operations - Chapter 2 “A broad Definition of Interoperability”, by Myron Hura, Gary McLeod, James Schneider and others, RAND Monograph Report, 2000, [http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1235/MR1235.chap2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Public safety===
Interoperability is an important issue for [[police|law enforcement]], [[fire fighting]], [[Emergency medical services|EMS]], and other public health and safety departments, because first responders need to be able to communicate during wide-scale emergencies. It has been a major area of investment and research over the last 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, D. K., Karanasios, S., &amp; Norman, A. (2013). Information sharing and interoperability: the case of major incident management. European Journal of Information Systems, 10.1057/ejis.2013.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldini, G. (2010). Report of the workshop on “Interoperable communications for Safety and Security”. Ispra: European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, agencies could not exchange information because they operated widely disparate hardware that was incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.firerescue1.com/fire-products/communications/interoperability/articles/424190-Interoperability-system-bridges-communications-gap/|title=Interoperability system bridges communications gap|newspaper=FireRescue1|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agencies' information systems such as computer-aided dispatch systems (CAD) and records management systems (RMS) functioned largely in isolation, so-called &quot;information islands.&quot; Agencies tried to bridge this isolation with inefficient, stop-gap methods while large agencies began implementing limited interoperable systems. These approaches were inadequate and, in the US, the lack of interoperability in the public safety realm become evident during the [[9/11 attacks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grier|first=Robin|title=Interoperability Solutions|url=http://www.catcomtec.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=34|work=Interoperability|publisher=Catalyst Communications|access-date=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Pentagon and World Trade Center structures. Further evidence of a lack of interoperability surfaced when agencies tackled the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina disaster.

In contrast to the overall national picture, some states, including Utah, have already made great strides forward. The [[Utah Highway Patrol]] and other departments in Utah have created a statewide [[data sharing]] network using technology from a company based in [[Bountiful, Utah]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20180710230842/https://www.fatpot.com/ FATPOT Technologies].

The Commonwealth of Virginia is one of the leading states in the United States in improving interoperability and is continually recognized as a National Best Practice by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Virginia's proven practitioner-driven governance structure ensures that all the right players are involved in decision making, training and exercises, and planning efforts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The Interoperability Coordinator leverages a regional structure to better allocate grant funding around the Commonwealth so that all areas have an opportunity to improve communications interoperability. Virginia's strategic plan for communications is updated yearly to include new initiatives for the Commonwealth&amp;nbsp;– all projects and efforts are tied to this plan, which is aligned with the National Emergency Communications Plan, authored by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Emergency Communications (OEC).

The State of Washington&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.wa.gov|title=Governor Jay Inslee - Washington State|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeks to enhance interoperability statewide. The State Interoperability Executive Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siec.wa.gov|title=SIEC|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SIEC), established by the legislature in 2003, works to assist emergency responder agencies (police, fire, sheriff, medical, hazmat, etc.) at all levels of government (city, county, state, tribal, federal) to define interoperability for their local region.

Washington recognizes collaborating on system design and development for wireless radio systems enables emergency responder agencies to efficiently provide additional services, increase interoperability, and reduce long-term costs.

This work saves the lives of emergency personnel and the citizens they serve.

The U.S. government is making an effort to overcome the nation's lack of public safety interoperability. The Department of Homeland Security's [[Office for Interoperability and Compatibility]] (OIC) is pursuing the SAFECOM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safecomprogram.gov/|title=SAFECOM - Homeland Security|access-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221211800/http://www.safecomprogram.gov/|archive-date=2014-12-21|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CADIP]] and [[Project 25]] programs, which are designed to help agencies as they integrate their CAD and other IT systems.

The OIC launched CADIP in August 2007. This project will partner the OIC with agencies in several locations, including [[Silicon Valley]]. This program will use case studies to identify the best practices and challenges associated with linking CAD systems across jurisdictional boundaries. These lessons will create the tools and resources public safety agencies can use to build interoperable CAD systems and communicate across local, state, and federal boundaries.

=== Information technology and computers ===

====Desktop====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}

The desktop interoperability (also known as interop) is a sub-section of the software interoperability. In the early days, the focus of ‘interop’ was to integrate web-applications with other web-applications. Over time, open-system ‘containers’ were developed to create a virtual desktop environment in which these applications could be registered and then communicate with each other using simple pub/sub patterns. Rudimentary UI capabilities were also supported allowing windows to be grouped with other windows. Today, the desktop interoperability has evolved into full-service interop platforms which include container support, basic exchange between web and web, but also native support for other application types and advanced window management. The very latest interop platforms also include application services such as universal search, notifications, user permissions and preferences, 3rd party application connectors and language adapters for in-house applications.

====Information search====
Search interoperability refers to the ability of two or more information collections to be searched by a single query.

Specifically related to web-based search, the challenge of interoperability stems from the fact designers of web resources typically have little or no need to concern themselves with exchanging information with other web resources. [[Federated Search]] technology, which does not place format requirements on the data owner, has emerged as one solution to search interoperability challenges. In addition, standards, such as [[OAI-PMH]], [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], and [[SPARQL]], have emerged recently that also help address the issue of search interoperability related to web resources. Such standards also address broader topics of interoperability, such as allowing data mining.

====Software====
[[Image:Interoperable software.png|250px|thumb|Interoperability: playing the two role network game, when one of the player clients (top left) runs under [[Sun Microsystems]] and another under [[GNU Classpath]] with [[JamVM]]. The applications execute the same [[bytecode]] and interoperate using the standard [[RMI-IIOP]] messages for communication]]
{{Main|Language interoperability|Semantic interoperability}}

With respect to [[software]], the term ''interoperability'' is used to describe the capability of different programs to exchange data via a common set of exchange formats, to read and write the same [[file format]]s, and to use the same [[protocol (computing)|protocol]]s. (The ability to execute the same [[executable|binary code]] on different [[Central processing unit|processor]] platforms is 'not' contemplated by the definition of interoperability.) The lack of interoperability can be a consequence of a lack of attention to [[standardization]] during the design of a program. Indeed, interoperability is not taken for granted in the non-standards-based portion of the computing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Official Guide to the SSCP Book|last=Gordon and Hernandez|publisher=SYBEX|isbn=978-1119278634|date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ISO/IEC 2382]]-01, ''Information Technology Vocabulary, Fundamental Terms'', interoperability is defined as follows: &quot;The capability to communicate, execute programs, or transfer data among various functional units in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those units&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jtc1sc36.org/doc/36N0646.pdf|title=Proposed Draft Technical Report for: ISO/IEC xxxxx, Information technology -- Learning, education, and training -- Management and delivery -- Specification and use of extensions and profiles|author=SC36 Secretariat|date=2003-11-13|publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129034634/http://old.jtc1sc36.org/doc/36N0646.pdf|archive-date=2007-11-29|url-status=dead|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the definition is somewhat ambiguous because the ''user'' of a program can be another program and, if the latter is a portion of the set of program that is required to be interoperable, it might well be that it does need to have knowledge of the characteristics of other units.

This definition focuses on the technical side of interoperability, while it has also been pointed out{{By whom|date=August 2016}} that interoperability is often more of an organizational issue: often interoperability has a significant impact on the organizations concerned, raising issues of ownership (do people want to share their data? or are they dealing with [[information silo]]s?), labor relations (are people prepared to undergo training?) and usability. In this context, a more apt definition is captured in the term ''[[business process interoperability]]''.

Interoperability can have important [[economic]] consequences; for example, research has estimated the cost of inadequate interoperability in the U.S. capital facilities industry to be $15.8 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author1=MP Gallaher|author2=AC O’Connor|author3=JL Dettbarn, Jr.|author4=LT Gilday|date=August 2004|title=Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/gcr/2004/NIST.GCR.04-867.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|page=iv|access-date=2012-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204225252/http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/gcr/2004/NIST.GCR.04-867.pdf|archive-date=2016-02-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; If competitors' products are not interoperable (due to causes such as [[patent]]s, [[trade secret]]s or [[Coordination failure (economics)|coordination failures]]), the result may well be [[monopoly]] or [[market failure]]. For this reason, it may be prudent for user communities or governments to take steps to encourage interoperability in various situations. At least 30 international bodies and countries have implemented [[eGovernment]]-based interoperability framework initiatives called [[e-GIF]] while in the United States there is the [[NIEM]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/tgf/201101/pdf00010.pdf |title=e-Government Interoperability A comparative analysis of 30 countries |publisher=CS Transform |year=2010 |access-date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standards Defining Organizations (SDOs) provide open public software specifications to facilitate interoperability; examples include the [[Oasis-Open]] organization and [[buildingSMART]] (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability). As far as user communities, [[Neutral Third Party]] is creating standards for business process interoperability. Another example of a neutral party is the [[Request for Comments|RFC]] documents from the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).

The OSLC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://open-services.net/|title=Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Open Service for Lifecycle Collaboration) community is working on finding a common standard in order that software tools can share and exchange data e.g. bugs, tasks, requirements etc. The final goal is to agree on an open standard for interoperability of open source [[Application Lifecycle Management|ALM]] tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/olberger/presentation-icssea2011|title=OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration): open standard for i…|date=30 November 2011|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Java is a great example of an interoperable programming language that allows for programs to be written once and run anywhere with a Java Virtual Machine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Write once, run anywhere]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2018}} One writing a program in Java, so long as it does not use system-specific functionality, will maintain interoperability with all machines that have a Java Virtual Machine. There are many implementations of the Java Virtual Machine, such as Oracle, IBM, Android, etc... If a Java Virtual Machine is created to specification, applications will maintain compatibility because while the implementation is different, the underlying language interfaces are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/clojure-programming/9781449310387/ch09.html|title=9. Java and JVM Interoperability [Book]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Achieving software=====
Software interoperability is achieved through five interrelated ways:
# Product testing
#: Products produced to a common standard, or to a sub-profile thereof, depend on the clarity of the standards, but there may be discrepancies in their implementations that system or unit testing may not uncover. This requires that systems formally be tested in a production scenario&amp;nbsp;– as they will be finally implemented&amp;nbsp;– to ensure they actually will intercommunicate as advertised, i.e. they are interoperable. Interoperable product testing is different from conformance-based product testing as conformance to a standard does not necessarily engender interoperability with another product which is also tested for conformance.
# Product engineering
#: Implements the common standard, or a sub-profile thereof, as defined by the industry/community partnerships with the specific intention of achieving interoperability with other software implementations also following the same standard or sub-profile thereof.
# Industry/community partnership
#: Industry-community partnerships, either domestic or international, sponsor standard workgroups with the purpose to define a common standard that may be used to allow software systems to intercommunicate for a defined purpose. At times an industry/community will sub-profile an existing standard produced by another organization to reduce options and thus making interoperability more achievable for implementations.
# Common technology and IP
#: The use of a common technology or IP may speed up and reduce the complexity of interoperability by reducing variability between components from different sets of separately developed software products and thus allowing them to intercommunicate more readily. This technique has some of the same technical results as using a common vendor product to produce interoperability. The common technology can come through 3rd party libraries or open-source developments.
# Standard implementation
#: Software interoperability requires a common agreement that is normally arrived at via an industrial, national or international [[standardisation|standard]].

Each of these has an important role in reducing variability in intercommunication software and enhancing a common understanding of the end goal to be achieved.

===Market dominance and power ===
Interoperability tends to be regarded as an issue for experts and its implications for daily living are sometimes underrated. The [[European Union Microsoft competition case]] shows how interoperability concerns important questions of power relationships. In 2004, the European Commission found that Microsoft had abused its market power by deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows work group servers and non-Microsoft work group servers. By doing so, Microsoft was able to protect its dominant market position for work group server operating systems, the heart of corporate IT networks. Microsoft was ordered to disclose complete and accurate interface documentation, which will enable rival vendors to compete on an equal footing (“the interoperability remedy”). As of June 2005, the Commission is market testing a new proposal by Microsoft to do this, having rejected previous proposals as insufficient.

Interoperability has also surfaced in the [[software patent debate]] in the [[European Parliament]] (June–July 2005). Critics claim that because patents on techniques required for interoperability are kept under RAND (reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing) conditions, customers will have to pay license fees twice: once for the product and, in the appropriate case, once for the patent-protected program the product uses.

===Medical industry===
New technology is being introduced in [[hospitals]] and labs at an ever-increasing rate. The need for “[[plug-and-play]]” interoperability&amp;nbsp;– the ability to take a medical device out of its box and easily make it work with one's other devices&amp;nbsp;– has attracted great attention from both healthcare providers and industry.

Increasingly, medical devices like incubators, imaging (MRI, CT, ultrasound, and others) are driven by sophisticated software that must integrate at the point of care and with electronic systems, such as electronic medical records. At the 2016 Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS) meeting, experts in the field like Angela N. Johnson with GE Healthcare and representative of the United States Food and Drug Administration provided practical seminars in how companies developing new medical devices, and hospitals installing them, can work more effectively to align interoperable software systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assurx.com/raps-preview-fda-cdrh-director-shuren-talks-priorities/ |title= RAPS Preview: FDA CDRH Director Shuren Talks Priorities |date= September 19, 2016 |access-date= April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Railways ===
{{anchor| Railways}}

Railways have greater or lesser interoperability depending on conforming to standards of [[Track gauge|gauge]], [[Railway coupling|couplings]], [[brake (railway)|brakes]], [[Railway signal|signalling]], [[communications]], [[loading gauge]], [[structure gauge]], and [[Railway signalling#Operating rules|operating rules]], to mention a few parameters. For passenger rail service, different [[railway platform height]] and [[platform gap|width clearance]] standards may also cause interoperability problems.

North American freight and intercity passenger railroads are highly interoperable, but systems in Europe, Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia are much less so. The parameter most difficult to overcome (at reasonable cost) is incompatibility of gauge, though [[variable gauge]] axle systems are increasingly used.

=== Telecommunications ===
In [[telecommunication]], the term can be defined as:

#The ability to provide services to and accept services from other systems, and to use the services exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together. [[ITU-T]] provides standards for international telecommunications. 
#The condition achieved among [[communications-electronics]] systems or items of communications-electronics equipment when [[information]] or services can be exchanged directly and satisfactorily between them and/or their users. The degree of interoperability should be defined when referring to specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DODDIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[two-way radio]], interoperability is composed of three dimensions:

* compatible communications paths (compatible frequencies, equipment and signaling),
* radio system coverage or adequate signal strength, and;
* scalable capacity.

==Organizations dedicated to interoperability==
Many organizations are dedicated to interoperability. All have in common that they want to push the development of the World Wide Web towards the semantic web.{{dubious|date=March 2014}} Some concentrate on eGovernment, eBusiness or data exchange in general. Internationally, [[Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium]] facilitates global interoperability across borders, language and technical barriers. In Europe, for instance, the European Commission and its [[IDABC]] program issue the [[European Interoperability Framework]]. IDABC was succeeded by the [[eGovernment in Europe#Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA)|ISA]] program. They also initiated the [[Semantic Interoperability Centre Europe]] (SEMIC.EU). A [https://web.archive.org/web/20080331053219/http://www.eulis.org/index.html European Land Information Service] (EULIS) was established in 2006, as a consortium of European National Land Registers. The aim of the service is to establish a single portal through which customers are provided with access to information about individual properties, about land and property registration services, and about the associated legal environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eulis.org/aims.html|title=Welcome - EULIS|first=Erskine|last=Design|access-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917042036/http://eulis.org/aims.html|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the government's CORE.gov service provides a collaboration environment for component development, sharing, registration, and reuse and related to this is the [http://www.NIEM.gov National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)] work and component repository. The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] serves as an agency for measurement standards.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2015}}
In [[telecommunication]], '''intersymbol interference''' ('''ISI''') is a form of [[distortion]] of a [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] in which one [[symbol (data)|symbol]] interferes with subsequent symbols. This is an unwanted phenomenon as the previous symbols have similar effect as [[electronic noise|noise]], thus making the communication less reliable. The spreading of the pulse beyond its allotted time interval causes it to interfere with neighboring pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lathi|first1=B.P.|last2=Ding|first2=Zhi|title=Modern Digital and Analog Communication Systems|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|isbn=9780195331455|page=394|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISI is usually caused by multipath propagation or the inherent linear or non-linear frequency response of a [[communication channel]] causing successive symbols to &quot;blur&quot; together.

The presence of ISI in the system introduces errors in the decision device at the receiver output. Therefore, in the design of the transmitting and receiving filters, the objective is to minimize the effects of ISI, and thereby deliver the digital data to its destination with the smallest error rate possible.

Ways to alleviate intersymbol interference include [[adaptive equalization]] and [[Error detection and correction|error correcting codes]].&lt;ref&gt;Digital Communications by Simon Haykin, McMaster University&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Multipath propagation ===
{{Main|Multipath propagation}}
One of the causes of intersymbol interference is [[multipath propagation]] in which a wireless signal from a transmitter reaches the receiver via multiple paths. The causes of this include [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] (for instance, the signal may bounce off buildings), [[refraction]] (such as through the [[leaf|foliage]] of a tree) and atmospheric effects such as [[atmospheric ducting]] and [[ionospheric reflection]]. Since the various paths can be of different lengths, this results in the different versions of the signal arriving at the receiver at different times. These delays mean that part or all of a given symbol will be spread into the subsequent symbols, thereby interfering with the correct detection of those symbols. Additionally, the various paths often distort the [[amplitude]] and/or [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the signal, thereby causing further interference with the received signal.

=== Bandlimited channels ===

Another cause of intersymbol interference is the transmission of a signal through a [[bandlimited]] channel, i.e., one where the [[frequency response]] is zero above a certain frequency (the cutoff frequency). Passing a signal through such a channel results in the removal of frequency components above this cutoff frequency. In addition, components of the frequency below the cutoff frequency may also be attenuated by the channel.

This [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] of the transmitted signal affects the shape of the pulse that arrives at the receiver. The effects of filtering a rectangular pulse not only change the shape of the pulse within the first symbol period, but it is also spread out over the subsequent symbol periods. When a message is transmitted through such a channel, the spread pulse of each individual symbol will interfere with following symbols.

Bandlimited channels are present in both wired and wireless communications. The limitation is often imposed by the desire to operate multiple independent signals through the same area/cable; due to this, each system is typically allocated a piece of the total [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] available. For wireless systems, they may be allocated a slice of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to transmit in (for example, [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] is often broadcast in the 87.5–108&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] range). This allocation is usually administered by a [[government agency]]; in the case of the United States this is the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). In a wired system, such as an [[optical fiber cable]], the allocation will be decided by the owner of the cable.

The bandlimiting can also be due to the physical properties of the medium - for instance, the cable being used in a wired system may have a cutoff frequency above which practically none of the transmitted signal will propagate.

Communication systems that transmit data over bandlimited channels usually implement [[pulse shaping]] to avoid interference caused by the bandwidth limitation. If the channel frequency response is flat and the shaping filter has a finite bandwidth, it is possible to communicate with no ISI at all. Often the channel response is not known beforehand, and an [[adaptive equalizer]] is used to compensate the frequency response.

== Effects on eye patterns ==
{{details|topic=eye patterns|Eye pattern}}

One way to study ISI in a [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] or data transmission system experimentally is to apply the received wave to the vertical deflection plates of an oscilloscope and to apply a sawtooth wave at the transmitted symbol rate R (R = 1/T) to the horizontal deflection plates. The resulting display is called an eye pattern because of its resemblance to the human eye for binary waves. The interior region of the eye pattern is called the eye opening. An eye pattern provides a great deal of information about the performance of the pertinent system.
# The width of the eye opening defines the time interval over which the received wave can be sampled without error from ISI. It is apparent that the preferred time for sampling is the instant of time at which the eye is open widest.
# The sensitivity of the system to timing error is determined by the rate of closure of the eye as the sampling time is varied.
# The height of the eye opening, at a specified sampling time, defines the margin over noise.

An eye pattern, which overlays many samples of a signal, can give a graphical representation of the
signal characteristics. The first image below is the eye pattern for a binary [[phase-shift keying]] (PSK) system in which a one is represented by an amplitude of −1 and a zero by an amplitude of +1. The current sampling time is at the center of the image and the previous and next sampling times are at the edges of the image. The various transitions from one sampling time to another (such as one-to-zero, one-to-one and so forth) can clearly be seen on the diagram.

The [[noise margin]] - the amount of noise required to cause the receiver to get an error - is given by the distance between the signal and the zero amplitude point at the sampling time; in other words, the further from zero at the sampling time the signal is the better. For the signal to be correctly interpreted, it must be sampled somewhere between the two points where the zero-to-one and one-to-zero transitions cross. Again, the further apart these points are the better, as this means the signal will be less sensitive to errors in the timing of the samples at the receiver.

The effects of ISI are shown in the second image which is an eye pattern of the same system when operating over a multipath channel. The effects of receiving delayed and distorted versions of the signal can be seen in the loss of definition of the signal transitions. It also reduces both the noise margin and the window in which the signal can be sampled, which shows that the performance of the system will be worse (i.e. it will have a greater [[bit error ratio]]).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Countering ISI ==

There are several techniques in [[telecommunication]] and data storage that try to work around the problem of intersymbol interference.

* Design systems such that the impulse response is short enough that very little energy from one symbol smears into the next symbol.
[[File:Raised-cosine-ISI.svg|thumb|500px|Consecutive raised-cosine impulses, demonstrating zero-ISI property]]
* Separate symbols in time with [[guard period]]s.
* Apply an [[Equalizer (communications)|equalizer]] at the receiver, that, broadly speaking, attempts to undo the effect of the channel by applying an inverse filter.
* Apply a [[Maximum likelihood sequence estimation|sequence detector]] at the receiver, that attempts to estimate the sequence of transmitted symbols using the [[Viterbi algorithm]].

== Intentional intersymbol interference ==
Coded modulation systems also exist that intentionally build a controlled amount of ISI into the system at the transmitter side, known as [[faster-than-Nyquist signaling]]. Such a design trades a computational complexity penalty at the receiver against a Shannon capacity gain of the overall transceiver system. See &lt;ref&gt;Faster than Nyquist Signaling, by J.B. Anderson, F. Rusek, and V. Owall, Proceedings of the IEEE, Aug. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; for a recent survey of this technique.

[[Image:Inverse square law.svg|thumb|420px|S represents the light source, while r represents the measured points. The lines represent the [[flux]] emanating from the sources and fluxes.
 
The total number of [[flux line]]s depends on the strength of the light source and is constant with increasing distance, where a greater density of flux lines (lines per unit area) means a stronger energy field. The density of flux lines is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source because the surface area of a sphere increases with the square of the radius. Thus the field intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.]]

In [[science]], an '''inverse-square law''' is any [[scientific law]] stating that a specified physical [[quantity]] is [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[distance]] from the source of that physical quantity. The fundamental cause for this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space.

[[Radar]] energy expands during both the signal transmission and the [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] return, so the [[inverse square]] for both paths means that the radar will receive energy according to the inverse [[fourth power]] of the range.

To prevent dilution of [[energy]] while propagating a signal, certain methods can be used such as a [[waveguide]], which acts like a canal does for water, or how a gun barrel restricts hot gas expansion to one [[dimension]] in order to prevent loss of energy transfer to a [[bullet]].

== Formula ==
Mathematically notated (see [[∝]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\text{intensity} \ \propto \ \frac{1}{\text{distance}^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

It can also be mathematically expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{intensity}_1}{\text{intensity}_2} = \frac{\text{distance}_2^2}{\text{distance}_1^2}&lt;/math&gt;

or as the formulation of a constant quantity:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{intensity}_1 \times \text{distance}_1^2 = \text{intensity}_2 \times \text{distance}_2^2&lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] of a [[vector field]] which is the resultant of radial inverse-square law fields with respect to one or more sources is everywhere proportional to the strength of the local sources, and hence zero outside sources. [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] follows an inverse-square law, as do the effects of [[electricity|electric]], [[magnetism|magnetic]], [[light]], [[sound]], and [[radiation]] phenomena.

== Justification ==
The inverse-square law generally applies when some force, energy, or [[flux|other conserved quantity]] is evenly radiated outward from a [[point source]] in [[three-dimensional space]].  Since the [[surface area]] of a [[sphere]] (which is&amp;nbsp;4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is proportional to the square of the radius, as the [[flux density|emitted radiation]] gets farther from the source, it is spread out over an area that is increasing in proportion to the square of the distance from the source. Hence, the intensity of radiation passing through any unit area (directly facing the point source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source. [[Gauss's law for gravity]] is similarly applicable, and can be used with any physical quantity that acts in accordance with the inverse-square relationship.

==Occurrences==

===Gravitation===
[[Gravity|Gravitation]] is the attraction between objects that have mass. Newton's law states:
: ''The gravitational attraction force between two '''point masses''' is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance. The force is always attractive and acts along the line joining them.''{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

If the distribution of matter in each body is spherically symmetric, then the objects can be treated as point masses without approximation, as shown in the [[shell theorem]].  Otherwise, if we want to calculate the attraction between massive bodies, we need to add all the point-point attraction forces vectorially and the net attraction might not be exact inverse square. However, if the separation between the massive bodies is much larger compared to their sizes, then to a good approximation, it is reasonable to treat the masses as a point mass located at the object's [[center of mass]] while calculating the gravitational force.

As the law of gravitation, this [[Law of universal gravitation|law]] was suggested in 1645 by [[Ismael Bullialdus]]. But Bullialdus did not accept [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's second and third laws]], nor did he appreciate [[Christiaan Huygens]]'s solution for circular motion (motion in a straight line pulled aside by the central force).  Indeed, Bullialdus maintained the sun's force was attractive at aphelion and repulsive at perihelion. [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]] both expounded gravitation in 1666 as an attractive force&lt;ref&gt;Hooke's gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses: See page 239 in Curtis Wilson (1989), &quot;The Newtonian achievement in astronomy&quot;, ch.13 (pages 233–274) in &quot;Planetary astronomy from the Renaissance to the rise of astrophysics: 2A: Tycho Brahe to Newton&quot;, CUP 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hooke's lecture &quot;On gravity&quot; at the Royal Society, London, on 21 March;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Birch, ''The History of the Royal Society of London'', … (London, England:  1756), vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lWEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 68–73]; see especially pages 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Borelli's &quot;Theory of the Planets&quot;, published later in 1666&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YZk_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Theoricae Mediceorum Planetarum ex Causius Physicis Deductae''] [Theory [of the motion] of the Medicean planets [i.e., moons of Jupiter] deduced from physical causes] (Florence, (Italy):  1666).&lt;/ref&gt;).  Hooke's 1670 Gresham lecture explained that gravitation applied to &quot;all celestiall bodys&quot; and added the principles that the gravitating power decreases with distance and that in the absence of any such power bodies move in straight lines. By 1679, Hooke thought gravitation had inverse square dependence and communicated this in a letter to [[Isaac Newton]]:&lt;ref name=Hooke1680&gt;{{cite journal |author = Koyré, Alexandre |authorlink = Alexandre Koyré |title = An Unpublished Letter of Robert Hooke to Isaac Newton |journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |year = 1952 |volume = 43 |issue = 4 |pages = 312–337 |jstor = 227384 |doi = 10.1086/348155 |pmid = 13010921 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''my supposition is that the attraction always is in duplicate proportion to the distance from the center reciprocall''.&lt;ref&gt;Hooke's letter to Newton of 6 January 1680 (Koyré 1952:332).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke remained bitter about Newton claiming the invention of this principle, even though Newton's 1686 ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' acknowledged that Hooke, along with Wren and Halley, had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system,&lt;ref&gt;Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1 (in all editions): See for example the 1729 English translation of the ''Principia'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false at page 66].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as giving some credit to Bullialdus.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to Edmund Halley dated 20 June 1686, Newton wrote:  &quot;Bullialdus wrote that all force respecting ye Sun as its center &amp; depending on matter must be reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of ye distance from ye center.&quot;  See:   I. Bernard Cohen and George E. Smith, ed.s, ''The Cambridge Companion to Newton'' (Cambridge, England:  Cambridge University Press, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3wIzvqzfUXkC&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 204].

===Electrostatics===
The force of attraction or repulsion between two electrically charged particles, in addition to being directly proportional to the product of the electric charges, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them; this is known as [[Coulomb's law]]. The deviation of the exponent from 2 is less than one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = New Experimental Test of Coulomb's Law: A Laboratory Upper Limit on the Photon Rest Mass |journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] |volume = 26 |issue = 12 |pages = 721–724 |year = 1971 |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.26.721 |last1=Williams |first1 = E. |last2 = Faller |first2 = J. |last3 = Hill |first3 = H. |bibcode = 1971PhRvL..26..721W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light and other electromagnetic radiation===

The [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] (or [[illuminance]] or [[irradiance]]) of [[light]] or other linear waves radiating from a [[point source]] (energy per unit of area perpendicular to the source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source; so an object (of the same size) twice as far away, receives only one-quarter the [[energy]] (in the same time period).

More generally, the irradiance, ''i.e.,'' the intensity (or [[power (physics)|power]] per unit area in the direction of [[wave propagation|propagation]]), of a [[sphere|spherical]] [[wavefront]] varies inversely with the square of the distance from the source (assuming there are no losses caused by [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] or [[scattering]]).

For example, the intensity of radiation from the [[Sun]] is 9126 [[watt]]s per square meter at the distance of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (0.387 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]); but only 1367 watts per square meter at the distance of [[Earth]] (1 AU)—an approximate threefold increase in distance results in an approximate ninefold decrease in intensity of radiation.

For non-[[isotropic radiator]]s such as [[parabolic antenna]]s, headlights, and [[laser]]s, the effective origin is located far behind the beam aperture. If you are close to the origin, you don't have to go far to double the radius, so the signal drops quickly. When you are far from the origin and still have a strong signal, like with a laser, you have to travel very far to double the radius and reduce the signal. This means you have a stronger signal or have [[antenna gain]] in the direction of the narrow beam relative to a wide beam in all directions of an [[Isotropic radiator|isotropic antenna]].

In [[photography]] and [[stage lighting]], the inverse-square law is used to determine the &quot;fall off&quot; or the difference in illumination on a subject as it moves closer to or further from the light source. For quick approximations, it is enough to remember that doubling the distance reduces illumination to one quarter;&lt;ref&gt;Millerson,G. (1991) ''Lighting for Film and Television – 3rd Edition'' p.27&lt;/ref&gt; or similarly, to halve the illumination increase the distance by a factor of 1.4 (the [[square root of 2]]), and to double illumination, reduce the distance to 0.7 (square root of 1/2). When the illuminant is not a point source, the inverse square rule is often still a useful approximation; when the size of the light source is less than one-fifth of the distance to the subject, the calculation error is less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;Ryer,A. (1997) &quot;The Light Measurement Handbook&quot;, {{ISBN|0-9658356-9-3}} p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

The fractional reduction in electromagnetic [[fluence]] (Φ) for indirectly ionizing radiation with increasing distance from a point source can be calculated using the inverse-square law. Since emissions from a point source have radial directions, they intercept at a perpendicular incidence. The area of such a shell is 4π''r'' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''r'' is the radial distance from the center.  The law is particularly important in diagnostic [[radiography]] and [[radiotherapy]] treatment planning, though this proportionality does not hold in practical situations unless source dimensions are much smaller than the distance.  As stated in [[Fourier theory]] of heat &quot;as the point source is magnification by distances , its radiation is dilute proportional to the sin of the angle, of the increasing circumference arc from the point of origin&quot;.

====Example====

Let ''P''&amp;nbsp; be the total power radiated from a point source (for example, an omnidirectional [[isotropic radiator]]). At large distances from the source (compared to the size of the source), this power is distributed over larger and larger spherical surfaces as the distance from the source increases.  Since the surface area of a sphere of radius ''r'' is ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4''πr''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] ''I'' (power per unit area) of radiation at distance ''r'' is
:&lt;math&gt;
I = \frac P A = \frac P {4 \pi r^2}. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The energy or intensity decreases (divided by&amp;nbsp;4) as the distance ''r'' is doubled; if measured in [[Decibel|dB]] would decrease by 3.01&amp;nbsp;dB per doubling of distance. When referring to measurements of power quantities, a ratio can be expressed as a level in decibels by evaluating ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the measured quantity to reference value.

===Sound in a gas===

In [[acoustics]], the [[sound pressure]] of a [[sphere|spherical]] [[wavefront]] radiating from a point source decreases by 50% as the distance ''r'' is doubled; measured in [[Decibel|dB]], the decrease is still 6.02&amp;nbsp;dB, since dB represents an intensity ratio. The pressure ratio (as opposed to power ratio) is not inverse-square, but is inverse-proportional (inverse distance law):

:&lt;math&gt; p \ \propto \ \frac{1}{r} \,
 &lt;/math&gt;

The same is true for the component of [[particle velocity]] &lt;math&gt; v \,&lt;/math&gt; that is [[Phase (waves)#In-phase and quadrature (I&amp;Q) components|in-phase]] with the instantaneous sound pressure &lt;math&gt;p \,&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; v \ \propto \frac{1}{r} \ \, &lt;/math&gt;

In the [[Near and far field|near field]] is a [[quadrature phase|quadrature component]] of the particle velocity that is 90° out of phase with the sound pressure and does not contribute to the time-averaged energy or the intensity of the sound.  The [[sound intensity]] is the product of the [[root mean square|RMS]] sound pressure and the ''in-phase'' component of the RMS particle velocity, both of which are inverse-proportional. Accordingly, the intensity follows an inverse-square behaviour:

:&lt;math&gt; I \ = \ p v \ \propto \ \frac{1}{r^2}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Field theory interpretation==
For an [[irrotational vector field]] in three-dimensional space, the inverse-square law corresponds to the property that the [[divergence]] is zero outside the source. This can be generalized to higher dimensions. Generally, for an irrotational vector field in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the intensity &quot;I&quot; of the vector field falls off with the distance &quot;r&quot; following the inverse (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power law

: &lt;math&gt;I\propto \frac 1 {r^{n-1}},&lt;/math&gt;

given that the space outside the source is divergence free. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==History==

[[John Dumbleton]] of the 14th-century [[Oxford Calculators]], was one of the first to express functional relationships in graphical form. He gave a proof of the [[mean speed theorem]] stating that &quot;the latitude of a uniformly difform movement corresponds to the degree of the midpoint&quot; and used this method to study the quantitative decrease in intensity of illumination in his ''Summa logicæ et philosophiæ naturalis'' (ca. 1349), stating that it was not linearly proportional to the distance, but was unable to expose the Inverse-square law.&lt;ref&gt;John Freely, ''Before Galileo: The Birth of Modern Science in Medieval Europe'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In proposition 9 of Book 1 in his book ''Ad Vitellionem paralipomena, quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur'' (1604), the astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] argued that the spreading of light from a point source obeys an inverse square law:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena, quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur'' (Frankfurt, (Germany):   Claude de Marne &amp; heir Jean Aubry, 1604), [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00007828/images/index.html?id=00007828&amp;fip=eayaxsewqxsfsdreayasdasxdsydeayaxsewq&amp;no=32&amp;seite=30 page 10.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translation of the Latin quote from Kepler's ''Ad Vitellionem paralipomena'' is from:  Gal, O. &amp; Chen-Morris, R.(2005) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2005HisSc..43..391G/0000398.000.html &quot;The Archaeology of the Inverse Square Law: (1) Metaphysical Images and Mathematical Practices,&quot;] ''History of Science'', '''43''' :   391–414 ; see especially p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Original:  ''Sicut se habent spharicae superificies, quibus origo lucis pro centro est, amplior ad angustiorem:  ita se habet fortitudo seu densitas lucis radiorum in angustiori, ad illamin in laxiori sphaerica, hoc est, conversim.  Nam per 6. 7. tantundem lucis est in angustiori sphaerica superficie, quantum in fusiore, tanto ergo illie stipatior &amp; densior quam hic.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Translation'':  Just as [the ratio of] spherical surfaces, for which the source of light is the center, [is] from the wider to the narrower, so the density or fortitude of the rays of light in the narrower [space], towards the more spacious spherical surfaces, that is, inversely.  For according to [propositions] 6 &amp; 7, there is as much light in the narrower spherical surface, as in the wider, thus it is as much more compressed and dense here than there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1645 in his book ''Astronomia Philolaica'' ..., the French astronomer [[Ismaël Bullialdus]] (1605–1694) refuted Johannes Kepler's suggestion that &quot;gravity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Note:  Both Kepler and William Gilbert had nearly anticipated the modern conception of gravity, lacking only the inverse-square law in their description of &quot;gravitas&quot;. On page 4 of chapter 1, Introductio, of ''Astronomia Nova'', Kepler sets out his description as follows:

''&quot;The true theory of gravity is founded on the following axioms:''

''Every corporeal substance, so far forth as it is corporeal, has a natural fitness for resting in every place where it may be situated by itself beyond the sphere of influence of a body cognate with it.''

'''''Gravity is a mutual affection between cognate bodies towards union or conjunction (similar in kind to the magnetic virtue), so that the earth attracts a stone much rather than the stone seeks the earth.'''''

...

''If two stones were placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the sphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two magnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, '''each approaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of the othe'''r.''

''If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by their animate force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would there meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same density.&quot;''

Notice that in saying &quot;''the earth attracts a stone much rather than the stone seeks the earth&quot;'' Kepler is breaking away from the Aristotelian tradition that objects ''seek'' to be in their natural place, that a stone ''seeks'' to be with the earth.&lt;/ref&gt; weakens as the inverse of the distance; instead, Bullialdus argued, &quot;gravity&quot; weakens as the inverse square of the distance:&lt;ref&gt;Ismail Bullialdus, ''Astronomia Philolaica'' … (Paris, France:  Piget, 1645), [http://diglib.hab.de/drucke/2-1-4-astron-2f-1/start.htm?image=00005 page 23.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translation of the Latin quote from Bullialdus' 'Astronomia Philolaica' … is from: O'Connor, John J. and Roberson, Edmund F.  (2006)  [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Boulliau.html &quot;Ismael Boulliau&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130062658/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Boulliau.html |date=30 November 2016 }}, The MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive, School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Saint Andrews, Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Original:  ''Virtus autem illa, qua Sol prehendit seu harpagat planetas, corporalis quae ipsi pro manibus est, lineis rectis in omnem mundi amplitudinem emissa quasi species solis cum illius corpore rotatur:  cum ergo sit corporalis imminuitur, &amp; extenuatur in maiori spatio &amp; intervallo, ratio autem huius imminutionis eadem est, ac luminus, in ratione nempe dupla intervallorum, sed eversa.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Translation'':  As for the power by which the Sun seizes or holds the planets, and which, being corporeal, functions in the manner of hands, it is emitted in straight lines throughout the whole extent of the world, and like the species of the Sun, it turns with the body of the Sun; now, seeing that it is corporeal, it becomes weaker and attenuated at a greater distance or interval, and the ratio of its decrease in strength is the same as in the case of light, namely, the duplicate proportion, but inversely, of the distances [that is, 1/d²].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In England, the Anglican bishop [[Seth Ward (bishop of Salisbury)|Seth Ward]] (1617–1689) publicized the ideas of Bullialdus in his critique ''In Ismaelis Bullialdi astronomiae philolaicae fundamenta inquisitio brevis'' (1653) and publicized the planetary astronomy of Kepler in his book ''Astronomia geometrica'' (1656).

In 1663–1664, the English scientist [[Robert Hooke]] was writing his book ''Micrographia'' (1666) in which he discussed, among other things, the relation between the height of the atmosphere and the barometric pressure at the surface.  Since the atmosphere surrounds the earth, which itself is a sphere, the volume of atmosphere bearing on any unit area of the earth's surface is a truncated cone (which extends from the earth's center to the vacuum of space; obviously only the section of the cone from the earth's surface to space bears on the earth's surface).  Although the volume of a cone is proportional to the cube of its height, Hooke argued that the air's pressure at the earth's surface is instead proportional to the height of the atmosphere because gravity diminishes with altitude.  Although Hooke did not explicitly state so, the relation that he proposed would be true only if gravity decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the earth's center.&lt;ref&gt;(Gal &amp; Chen-Morris, 2005), pp. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hooke, ''Micrographia'' … (London, England:  John Martyn, 1667), [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=goto&amp;id=HistSciTech.HookeMicro&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=227 page 227:]  &quot;[I say a ''Cylinder'', not a piece of a ''Cone'', because, as I may elsewhere shew in the Explication of Gravity, that ''triplicate'' proportion of the shels of a Sphere, to their respective diameters, I suppose to be removed in this case by the decrease of the power of Gravity.]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunication]] and [[radio science]], an '''ionospheric sounding''' is a technique that provides real-time [[data]] on [[high-frequency]] ionospheric-dependent [[radio propagation]], using a basic [[system]] consisting of a synchronized transmitter and receiver. 

The time [[Propagation delay|delay]] between [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] and reception is translated into effective [[ionospheric layer]] altitude. Vertical incident sounding uses a collocated transmitter and receiver and involves directing a range of frequencies vertically to the [[ionosphere]] and measuring the values of the reflected returned signals to determine the effective ionosphere layer altitude. This technique is also used to determine the [[critical frequency]]. Oblique sounders use a transmitter at one end of a given propagation path, and a synchronized receiver, usually with an oscilloscope-type display ([[ionogram]]), at the other end. The transmitter emits a stepped- or swept-[[frequency]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] which is displayed or measured at the receiver. The measurement converts [[time]] delay to effective altitude of the ionospheric layer. The ionogram display shows the effective altitude of the ionospheric layer as a function of frequency.

&lt;!-- This is an article, not a disambiguation. Please let's keep it an article and edit it as an article. --&gt;

A sequence of events is '''isochronous''' if the events occur regularly, or at equal [[time]] intervals. The term ''isochronous'' is used in several technical contexts, but usually refers to the primary subject maintaining a constant period or interval (the reciprocal of [[frequency]]), despite variations in other measurable factors in the same system. Isochronous timing is a characteristic of a repeating event whereas [[synchronous]] timing refers to the relationship between two or more events.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188|article=isochronous}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[dynamical systems theory]], an [[oscillation|oscillator]] is called ''isochronous'' if its [[frequency]] is independent of its [[amplitude]].
*In [[horology]], a mechanical [[clock]] or [[watch]] is ''isochronous'' if it runs at the same rate regardless of changes in its drive force, so that it keeps correct time as its [[mainspring]] unwinds or chain length varies. Isochrony is important in [[timekeeping]] devices.
*In [[electricity generation|electrical power generation]], ''isochronous'' means that the frequency of the electricity generated is constant under varying load; there is zero [[droop speed control|generator droop]]. (See [[Synchronization (alternating current)]].)
*In [[telecommunications]], an [[isochronous signal]] is one where the [[time]] interval separating any two corresponding transitions is equal to the [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]] or to a multiple of the unit interval; but phase is arbitrary and potentially varying.
**The term is also used in [[data transmission]] to describe cases in which corresponding significant instants of two or more sequential signals have a constant [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship.
**[[Isochronous burst transmission]] is used when the information-bearer channel rate is higher than the input data signaling rate.
*In the [[Universal Serial Bus]] used in [[computer]]s, ''isochronous'' is one of the four data flow types for USB devices (the others being Control, Interrupt and Bulk). It is commonly used for streaming data types such as video or audio sources. Similarly, the [[IEEE 1394 interface]] standard, commonly called Firewire, includes support for isochronous streams of audio and video at known constant rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 1394 Isochronous Transfers |author= Bill McKenzie |work= Windows Driver Developer Digest |date= September 15, 2003 |url= http://www.wd-3.com/archive/1394IsochronousTransfersPart1.htm |accessdate= July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[particle accelerator]]s an [[isochronous cyclotron]] is a cyclotron where the field strength increases with radius to compensate for relativistic increase in mass with speed.
*An '''isochrone''' is a [[contour line]] of equal time, for instance, in [[stratum|geological layers]], [[dendrochronology|tree rings]] or [[wave front]]s. An [[isochrone map]] or diagram shows such contours.
*In [[linguistics]], [[isochrony]] is the postulated rhythmic division of time into equal portions by a language.
*In [[neurology]], [[isochronic tones]] are regular beats of a single [[pure tone|tone]] used for [[brainwave entrainment]].

{{One source|date=October 2019}}
'''Isochronous burst transmission''' is a method of  transmission.  In a [[data]] [[telecommunications network|network]] where the [[information-bearer channel]] rate is higher than the input [[data signaling rate]], [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] is performed by &lt;nowiki&gt;interrupting&lt;/nowiki&gt;, at controlled intervals, the [[data stream]] being transmitted.

''Note 1:'' [[Burst transmission]] in [[isochronous]] form enables communication between [[data terminal equipment]] (DTE) and data networks that operate at dissimilar data signaling rates, such as when the information-bearer channel rate is higher than the DTE output data signaling rate.

''Note 2:''  The [[binary code|binary]] digits are transferred at the information-bearer channel rate. The [[data transfer]] is interrupted at intervals in order to produce the required average data signaling rate.

In [[telecommunication]], an '''isochronous signal''' is a [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] in which the [[time]] interval separating any two significant instants is equal to the [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]] or a multiple of the unit interval. Variations in the time intervals are constrained within specified limits.

&quot;[[Isochronous]]&quot; is a characteristic of one signal, while &quot;[[Synchronization|synchronous]]&quot; indicates a relationship between two or more signals.

'''Jerkiness''', sometimes called '''strobing''' or '''choppy''', describes the perception of individual still images in a motion picture.

Motion pictures are made from still images shown in rapid sequence. Provided there is sufficient continuity between the images and provided the sequence is shown fast enough, the [[central nervous system]] interprets the sequence as continuous motion. However, some technologies cannot process or carry data fast enough for sufficiently high [[frame rate]]s. For example, viewing motion pictures by [[Internet]] connection generally necessitates a greatly reduced frame rate, making jerkiness clearly apparent.

In conventional [[cinematography]], the images are filmed and displayed at 24 frames per second, at which speed jerkiness is not normally discernible.
[[Television screen]]s [[refresh rate|refresh]] at even higher [[frequency|frequencies]]. [[PAL]] and [[SÉCAM]] television (the standards in [[Europe]]) refresh at 25 or 50 ([[HDTV]]) frames per second. [[NTSC]] television displays (the standard in [[North America]]) refresh at 29.97 frames per second.
[[Animated cartoon]] films are typically made at reduced frame rates (accomplished by shooting several [[film frame]]s of the individual drawings) so as to limit production costs, with the result that jerkiness tends to be apparent, especially on older [[limited animation]] features.

'''Strobing''' can also refer to [[cross colour]] and [[Moiré pattern|Moiré patterning]]. Cross colour refers to when any high frequency luminance content of the picture, close to the TV systems colour sub-carrier frequency, is interpreted by the analogue receiver's decoder as colour information. Moiré patterning is where an interference pattern is produced by fine scene detail beating with the line (or even [[pixel]]) structure of the device used to analyse or display the scene.

In [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]], '''jitter''' is the deviation from true periodicity of a presumably [[Periodic function|periodic signal]], often in relation to a reference [[clock signal]]. In [[clock recovery]] applications it is called '''timing jitter'''.&lt;ref name=wol91p211&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolaver |first=Dan H. |date=1991 |title=Phase-Locked Loop Circuit Design |url=https://archive.org/details/phaselockedloopc00wola |url-access=limited |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-662743-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/phaselockedloopc00wola/page/n215 211]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in the design of almost all communications links.

Jitter can be quantified in the same terms as all time-varying signals, e.g., [[root mean square]] (RMS), or peak-to-peak displacement.  Also like other time-varying signals, jitter can be expressed in terms of [[spectral density]].

'''Jitter period''' is the interval between two times of maximum effect (or minimum effect) of a signal characteristic that varies regularly with time.  '''Jitter frequency''', the more commonly quoted figure, is its inverse. [[ITU-T]] G.810 classifies jitter frequencies below 10&amp;nbsp;Hz as '''wander''' and frequencies at or above 10&amp;nbsp;Hz as jitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FTB-8080 Sync Analyzer: Resolving Synchronization Problems in Telecom Networks |publisher=EXFO |url=http://documents.exfo.com/appnotes/anote119-ang.pdf |id=Application note 119 |accessdate=2012-08-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207103425/http://documents.exfo.com/appnotes/anote119-ang.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jitter may be caused by [[electromagnetic interference]] and [[crosstalk]] with carriers of other signals. Jitter can cause a display monitor to flicker, affect the performance of processors in personal computers, introduce clicks or other undesired effects in audio signals, and cause loss of transmitted data between network devices. The amount of tolerable jitter depends on the affected application.

==Metrics==
For [[clock signal|clock]] jitter, there are three commonly used metrics:

;Absolute jitter 
:The [[absolute difference]] in the position of a clock's edge from where it would ideally be.

;Period jitter (a.k.a. ''cycle jitter'')
:The difference between any one clock period and the ideal or average clock period. Period jitter tends to be important in synchronous circuitry such as digital state machines where the error-free operation of the circuitry is limited by the shortest possible clock period (average period less maximum cycle jitter), and the performance of the circuitry is set by the average clock period. Hence, synchronous circuitry benefits from minimizing period jitter, so that the shortest clock period approaches the average clock period.

;Cycle-to-cycle jitter
:The difference in duration of any two adjacent clock periods.  It can be important for some types of clock generation circuitry used in [[microprocessor]]s and [[RAM]] interfaces.

In [[telecommunications]], the unit used for the above types of jitter is usually the [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]] (UI) which quantifies the jitter in terms of a fraction of the transmission unit period. This unit is useful because it scales with clock frequency and thus allows relatively slow interconnects such as [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] to be compared to higher-speed internet backbone links such as [[OC-192]].  Absolute units such as ''picoseconds'' are more common in microprocessor applications.  Units of ''degrees'' and ''radians'' are also used.

[[Image:standard deviation diagram.svg|thumb|350px|In the normal distribution one [[standard deviation]] from the [[mean]] (dark blue) accounts for about 68% of the set, while two standard deviations from the mean (medium and dark blue) account for about 95% and three standard deviations (light, medium, and dark blue) account for about 99.7%.]]
If jitter has a [[Gaussian distribution]], it is usually quantified using the [[standard deviation]] of this distribution. This translates to an RMS measurement for a zero-mean distribution.  Often, jitter distribution is significantly non-Gaussian.  This can occur if the jitter is caused by external sources such as power supply noise.  In these cases, ''peak-to-peak'' measurements may be more useful.  Many efforts have been made to meaningfully quantify distributions that are neither Gaussian nor have a meaningful peak level.  All have shortcomings but most tend to be good enough for the purposes of engineering work.  {{citation needed span|Note that typically, the reference point for jitter is defined such that the ''[[Arithmetic mean|mean]]'' jitter is 0.|date=March 2018}}

In [[computer network]]ing, jitter can refer to [[packet delay variation]], the variation ([[statistical dispersion]]) in the delay of the [[Packet (information technology)|packets]].

==Types==
One of the main differences between random and deterministic jitter is that deterministic jitter is bounded and random jitter is unbounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Julian |last1=Hagedorn |first2=Falk |last2=Alicke |first3=Ankur |last3=Verma |title=How to Measure Total Jitter |url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/scaa120b/scaa120b.pdf |id=SCAA120B |date=August 2017 |publisher=[[Texas Instruments]] |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Jitter Calculations |url=http://teledynelecroy.com/doc/understanding-dj-ddj-pj-jitter-calculations |date=July 9, 2014 |publisher=[[Teledyne Technologies]] |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random jitter===
Random Jitter, also called Gaussian jitter, is unpredictable electronic timing noise. Random jitter typically follows a [[normal distribution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Julian |last1=Hagedorn |first2=Falk |last2=Alicke |first3=Ankur |last3=Verma |title=How to Measure Total Jitter |url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/scaa120b/scaa120b.pdf |id=SCAA120B |date=August 2017 |publisher=[[Texas Instruments]] |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Jitter Calculations |url=http://teledynelecroy.com/doc/understanding-dj-ddj-pj-jitter-calculations |date=July 9, 2014 |publisher=[[Teledyne Technologies]] |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to being caused by [[thermal noise]] in an [[electrical circuit]] or due to the [[central limit theorem]].  The central limit theorem states that composite effect of many uncorrelated noise sources, regardless of the distributions, approaches a normal distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chow |first=Daniel |title=Jitter Visualization, Part 1: Random Jitter |url=http://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4423552/See-jitter-s-faces--Random--periodic--and-ISI |publisher=UBM Tech |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deterministic jitter===
'''Deterministic jitter''' is a type of clock or data signal jitter that is predictable and reproducible. The peak-to-peak value of this jitter is bounded, and the bounds can easily be observed and predicted. Deterministic jitter has a known non-normal distribution. Deterministic jitter can either be correlated to the data stream ([[data-dependent jitter]]) or uncorrelated to the data stream (bounded uncorrelated jitter). Examples of data-dependent jitter are duty-cycle dependent jitter (also known as duty-cycle distortion) and [[intersymbol interference]].

Total jitter (''T'') is the combination of random jitter (''R'') and deterministic jitter (''D'') and is computed in the context to a required [[bit error rate]] (BER) for the system:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Meaning of Total Jitter |first=Ransom |last=Stephens |url=http://www.ransomsnotes.com/index_htm_files/RansomStephensJitter360Pt1TheMeaningOfTotalJitter.pdf |publisher=[[Tektronix]] |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{math|1=''T'' = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;peak-to-peak&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''nR''&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt;}},

in which the value of ''n'' is based on the BER required of the link.

A common BER used in communication standards such as [[Ethernet]] is 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Examples==

===Sampling jitter===
In analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion of signals, the sampling is normally assumed to be periodic with a fixed period—the time between every two samples is the same. If there is jitter present on the clock signal to the [[analog-to-digital converter]] or a [[digital-to-analog converter]], the time between samples varies and instantaneous signal error arises. The error is proportional to the [[slew rate]] of the desired signal and the absolute value of the clock error.  The effect of jitter on the signal depends on the nature of the jitter. Random jitter tends to add broadband noise while periodic jitter tends to add errant spectral components, &quot;birdys&quot;.  In some conditions, less than a nanosecond of jitter can reduce the effective bit resolution of a converter with a [[Nyquist frequency]] of 22&amp;nbsp;kHz to 14 bits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puente&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Puente León |first=Fernando |title=Messtechnik|publisher=Springer |year=2015 |page=332f |url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783662448205 |isbn=978-3-662-44820-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sampling jitter is an important consideration in high-frequency signal conversion, or where the clock signal is especially prone to interference.

In [[digital antenna array]]s [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]] and [[digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] jitters are the important factors determining the [[direction of arrival]] estimation accuracy&lt;ref name=slyusarDoA&gt;{{Cite journal|author = M. Bondarenko and V.I.

===Packet jitter in computer networks===
In the context of computer networks, packet jitter or [[packet delay variation]] (PDV) is the variation in latency as measured in the variability over time of the [[end-to-end delay]] across a network. A network with constant delay has no packet jitter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comer&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Comer |first=Douglas E. |title=Computer Networks and Internets |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2008 |page=476 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tm-evHmOs3oC&amp;pg=PA476 |isbn=978-0-13-606127-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packet jitter is expressed as an average of the deviation from the network mean delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |last=Demichelis |first=C. |rfc=3393 |title=IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) |date=November 2002 |publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; PDV is an important [[quality of service]] factor in assessment of network performance.

Transmitting a burst of traffic at a high rate followed by an interval or period of lower or zero rate transmission may also be seen as a form of jitter, as it represents a deviation from the average transmission rate. However, unlike the jitter caused by variation in latency, transmitting in bursts may be seen as a desirable feature,{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} e.g. in [[variable bitrate]] transmissions.

===Video and image jitter===
Video or image jitter occurs when the horizontal lines of video image frames are randomly displaced due to the corruption of synchronization signals or electromagnetic interference during video transmission. Model-based dejittering study has been carried out under the framework of digital image and video restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kang |first1=Sung-Ha |title=Video Dejittering by Bake and Shake |journal=Image and Vision Computing |year=2006 |last2=Shen |first2=Jianhong (Jackie) |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143–152 |doi=10.1016/j.imavis.2005.09.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing==
Jitter in serial bus architectures is measured by means of [[eye pattern]]s. There are standards for jitter measurement in serial bus architectures. The standards cover [[jitter tolerance]], [[jitter transfer function]] and [[jitter generation]], with the required values for these attributes varying among different applications. Where applicable, compliant systems are required to conform to these standards.

Testing for jitter and its measurement is of growing importance to electronics engineers because of increased clock frequencies in digital electronic circuitry to achieve higher device performance. Higher clock frequencies have commensurately smaller eye openings, and thus impose tighter tolerances on jitter. For example, modern computer [[motherboard]]s have serial bus architectures with eye openings of 160 [[picosecond]]s or less. This is extremely small compared to parallel bus architectures with equivalent performance, which may have eye openings on the order of 1000 [[picosecond]]s.

Jitter is measured and evaluated in various ways depending on the type of circuit under test.&lt;ref name=slyusar&gt;{{Cite news|author = M. Bondarenko and V.I. Slyusar.|title = Methods for estimating the ADC jitter in noncoherent systems. // Radioelectronics and Communications Systems. - Volume 54, Number 10, 2011. – Pp. 536 - 545. - DOI: 10.3103/S0735272711100037.
|url= http://slyusar.kiev.ua/en/IZV_2011_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, the goal of jitter measurement is to verify that the jitter will not disrupt normal operation of the circuit.

Testing of device performance for jitter tolerance may involve injection of jitter into electronic components with specialized test equipment.

A less direct approach—in which analog waveforms are digitized and the resulting data stream analyzed—is employed when measuring pixel jitter in [[frame grabber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Khvilivitzky |first=Alexander |title=Pixel Jitter in Frame Grabbers |date=2008 |url=http://www.sensoray.com/support/appnotes/pixjiter.htm |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation==

=== Anti-jitter circuits===
Anti-jitter circuits (AJCs) are a class of [[electronic circuit]]s designed to reduce the level of jitter in a clock signal. AJCs operate by re-timing the output pulses so they align more closely to an idealized clock. They are widely used in clock and data recovery circuits in [[digital communications]], as well as for data sampling systems such as the [[analog-to-digital converter]] and [[digital-to-analog converter]]. Examples of anti-jitter circuits include [[phase-locked loop]] and [[delay-locked loop]].

===Jitter buffers===
Jitter buffers or de-jitter buffers are used to counter jitter introduced by queuing in [[packet switching|packet-switched networks]] to ensure continuous playout of an audio or video [[media stream]] transmitted over the network.  The maximum jitter that can be countered by a de-jitter buffer is equal to the buffering delay introduced before starting the play-out of the media stream. In the context of packet-switched networks, the term ''[[packet delay variation]]'' is often preferred over ''jitter''.

Some systems use sophisticated delay-optimal de-jitter buffers that are capable of adapting the buffering delay to changing network characteristics. The adaptation logic is based on the jitter estimates computed from the arrival characteristics of the media packets. Adjustments associated with adaptive de-jittering involves introducing discontinuities in the media play-out which may be noticeable to the listener or viewer. Adaptive de-jittering is usually carried out for audio play-outs that include [[voice activity detection]] that allows the lengths of the silence periods to be adjusted, thus minimizing the perceptual impact of the adaptation.

===Dejitterizer===
A dejitterizer is a device that reduces jitter in a [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C |article=dejitterizer |url=https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-011/_1532.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; A dejitterizer usually consists of an [[elastic buffer]] in which the signal is temporarily stored and then retransmitted at a rate based on the average rate of the incoming signal. A dejitterizer may not be effective in removing low-frequency jitter (wander).

===Filtering and decomposition===
A filter can be designed to minimize the effect of sampling jitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document |author1=S. Ahmed |author2=T. Chen |title=Minimizing the effects of sampling jitters in wireless sensors networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jitter signal can be decomposed into [[Hilbert–Huang transform|Intrinsic Mode Functions]] (IMFs), which can be further applied for filtering or dejittering.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

In [[telecommunications]] the '''Kendall effect''' is a spurious pattern or other [[distortion]] in a [[Fax|facsimile]].

It is caused by unwanted [[modulation]] products which arise from the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of the [[carrier signal]], and appear in the form of a rectified [[baseband]] that interferes with the lower [[sideband]] of the carrier.  

The Kendall effect occurs principally when the single-sideband width is greater than half of the facsimile [[carrier frequency]].

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
In [[optics]], '''Lambert's cosine law''' says that the [[radiant intensity]] or [[luminous intensity]] observed from an ideal [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflecting]] surface or ideal diffuse radiator is [[directly proportional]] to the [[cosine]] of the angle ''θ'' between the direction of the incident light and the [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]].&lt;ref name = &quot;RCAEOH&quot;&gt;RCA Electro-Optics Handbook, p.18 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SmithW&quot;&gt;Modern Optical Engineering, Warren J. Smith, McGraw-Hill, p.&amp;nbsp;228, 256&lt;/ref&gt; The law is also known as the '''cosine emission law'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Optics | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | last=Pedrotti &amp; Pedrotti | date=1993 | isbn=0135015456 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoop00pedr }}&lt;/ref&gt;  or '''Lambert's emission law'''. It is named after [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], from his ''[[Photometria]]'', published in 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lambert | first=Johann Heinrich | title=Photometria, sive de mensura et gradibus luminis, colorum et umbrae | publisher=Eberhard Klett | date=1760 | url=https://www.e-rara.ch/zut/content/titleinfo/2814923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A surface which obeys Lambert's law is said to be ''Lambertian'', and exhibits [[Lambertian reflectance]]. Such a surface has the same [[radiance]] when viewed from any angle. This means, for example, that to the human eye it has the same apparent brightness (or [[luminance]]). It has the same radiance because, although the emitted power from a given area element is reduced by the cosine of the emission angle, the solid angle, subtended by surface visible to the viewer, is reduced by the same very amount. Because the ratio between power and solid angle is constant, radiance (power per unit solid angle per unit projected source area) stays the same.

==Lambertian scatterers and radiators==

When an area element is radiating as a result of being illuminated by an external source, the [[irradiance]] (energy or photons/time/area) landing on that area element will be proportional to the cosine of the angle between the illuminating source and the normal. A Lambertian scatterer will then scatter this light according to the same cosine law as a Lambertian emitter. This means that although the radiance of the surface depends on the angle from the normal to the illuminating source, it will not depend on the angle from the normal to the observer. For example, if the [[moon]] were a Lambertian scatterer, one would expect to see its scattered brightness appreciably diminish towards the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] due to the increased angle at which sunlight hit the surface. The fact that it does not diminish illustrates that the moon is not a Lambertian scatterer, and in fact tends to scatter more light into the [[oblique angle]]s than a Lambertian scatterer.

The emission of a Lambertian radiator does not depend on the amount of incident radiation, but rather from radiation originating in the emitting body itself. For example, if the [[sun]] were a Lambertian radiator, one would expect to see a constant brightness across the entire solar disc. The fact that the sun exhibits [[limb darkening]] in the visible region illustrates that it is not a Lambertian radiator. A [[black body]] is an example of a Lambertian radiator.

==Details of equal brightness effect==

|}
&lt;/div&gt;
The situation for a Lambertian surface (emitting or scattering) is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.  For conceptual clarity we will think in terms of [[photon]]s rather than [[energy]] or [[luminous energy]]. The wedges in the [[circle]] each represent an equal angle ''dΩ'', of an arbitrarily chosen size, and for a Lambertian surface, the number of photons per second emitted into each wedge is proportional to the area of the wedge.

The length of each wedge is the product of the [[diameter]] of the circle and cos(''θ''). The maximum rate of photon emission per unit [[solid angle]] is along the normal, and diminishes to zero for ''θ'' = 90°. In mathematical terms, the [[radiance]] along the normal is ''I''&amp;nbsp;photons/(s·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·sr) and the number of photons per second emitted into the vertical wedge is ''I'' ''dΩ'' ''dA''. The number of photons per second emitted into the wedge at angle ''θ'' is ''I''&amp;nbsp;cos(''θ'')&amp;nbsp;''dΩ''&amp;nbsp;''dA''.

Figure 2 represents what an observer sees. The observer directly above the area element will be seeing the scene through an aperture of area ''dA''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the area element ''dA'' will subtend a (solid) angle of ''dΩ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a portion of the observer's total angular field-of-view of the scene. Since the wedge size ''dΩ'' was chosen arbitrarily, for convenience we may assume without loss of generality that it coincides with the solid angle subtended by the aperture when &quot;viewed&quot; from the locus of the emitting area element dA. Thus the normal observer will then be recording the same ''I''&amp;nbsp;''dΩ''&amp;nbsp;''dA'' photons per second emission derived above and will measure a radiance of

:&lt;math&gt;
I_0=\frac{I\, d\Omega\, dA}{d\Omega_0\, dA_0}
&lt;/math&gt;  photons/(s·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·sr).

The observer at angle ''θ'' to the normal will be seeing the scene through the same aperture of area ''dA''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (still corresponding to a ''dΩ'' wedge) and from this oblique vantage the area element ''dA'' is foreshortened and will subtend a (solid) angle of ''dΩ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;cos(''θ'').  This observer will be recording ''I''&amp;nbsp;cos(''θ'')&amp;nbsp;''dΩ''&amp;nbsp;''dA'' photons per second, and so will be measuring a radiance of

:&lt;math&gt;
I_0=\frac{I \cos(\theta)\, d\Omega\, dA}{d\Omega_0\, \cos(\theta)\, dA_0}
=\frac{I\, d\Omega\, dA}{d\Omega_0\, dA_0}
&lt;/math&gt;  photons/(s·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·sr),

which is the same as the normal observer.

== Relating peak luminous intensity and luminous flux ==

In general, the [[luminous intensity]] of a point on a surface varies by direction; for a Lambertian surface, that distribution is defined by the cosine law, with peak luminous intensity in the normal direction. Thus when the Lambertian assumption holds, we can calculate the total [[luminous flux]], &lt;math&gt;F_{tot}&lt;/math&gt;, from the peak [[luminous intensity]], &lt;math&gt;I_{max}&lt;/math&gt;, by integrating the cosine law:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{tot} = \int\limits_0^{2\pi}\,\int\limits_0^{\pi/2}\cos(\theta)I_{max}\,\sin(\theta)\,\operatorname{d}\theta\,\operatorname{d}\phi&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;= 2\pi\cdot I_{max}\int\limits_0^{\pi/2}\cos(\theta)\sin(\theta)\,\operatorname{d}\theta  &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;= 2\pi\cdot I_{max}\int\limits_0^{\pi/2}\frac{\sin(2\theta)}{2}\,\operatorname{d}\theta &lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;F_{tot}=\pi\,\mathrm{sr}\cdot I_{max}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the determinant of the [[Jacobian matrix]] for the [[unit sphere]], and realizing that &lt;math&gt;I_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is luminous flux per [[steradian]].&lt;ref&gt;Incropera and DeWitt, ''Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer'', 5th ed., p.710.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the peak intensity will be &lt;math&gt;1/(\pi\,\mathrm{sr})&lt;/math&gt; of the total radiated luminous flux. For Lambertian surfaces, the same factor of &lt;math&gt;\pi\,\mathrm{sr}&lt;/math&gt; relates [[luminance]] to [[luminous emittance]], [[radiant intensity]] to [[radiant flux]], and [[radiance]] to [[radiant emittance]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Radians and steradians are, of course, dimensionless and so &quot;rad&quot; and &quot;sr&quot; are included only for clarity.

Example: A surface with a luminance of say 100&amp;nbsp;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (= 100 nits, typical PC monitor) will, if it is a perfect Lambert emitter, have a luminous emittance of 314 lm/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. If its area is 0.1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (~19&quot; monitor) then the total light emitted, or luminous flux, would thus be 31.4 lm.

LNA may differ from the stated NA of a final focusing element if, for example, that element is underfilled or the focus is other than that for which the element is specified. 
LNA is one of the parameters that determine the initial distribution of power among the modes of an optical fiber.

      <text bytes="1926" xml:space="preserve">A '''leaky mode''' or '''tunneling mode''' in an [[optical fiber]] or other [[waveguide]] is a [[Normal mode|mode]] having an [[electric field]] that decays monotonically for a finite distance in the transverse direction but becomes oscillatory everywhere beyond that finite distance. Such a mode gradually &quot;leaks&quot; out of the waveguide as it travels down it, producing [[attenuation]] even if the waveguide is perfect in every respect.  In order for a leaky mode to be definable as a mode, the relative amplitude of the oscillatory part (the leakage rate) must be sufficiently small that the mode substantially maintains its shape as it decays.

Leaky modes correspond to leaky rays in the terminology of [[geometric optics]].
The propagation of light through optical fibre can take place via meridional rays or skew rays. These skew rays suffer only partial reflection while meridional rays are completely guided. Thus the modes allowing propagation of skew rays are called leaky modes. 
Some optical power is lost into clad due to these modes.

[[File:Linear polarization schematic.png|162px|thumb|right|Diagram of the electric field of a light wave (blue), linear-polarized along a plane (purple line), and consisting of two orthogonal, in-phase components (red and green waves)]]
In [[electrodynamics]], '''linear polarization''' or '''plane polarization''' of [[electromagnetic radiation]] is a confinement of the [[electric field]] vector or [[magnetic field]] vector to a given plane along the direction of propagation. See ''[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]'' and ''[[plane of polarization]]'' for more information.

The orientation of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave is defined by the direction of the [[electric field]] vector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapira,&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Mathematical description==
The [[Classical physics|classical]] [[sinusoidal]] plane wave solution of the [[electromagnetic wave equation]] for the [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] fields is (cgs units)
 
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} ( \mathbf{r} , t ) = \mid\mathbf{E}\mid  \mathrm{Re} \left \{  |\psi\rangle  \exp \left [ i \left  ( kz-\omega t  \right ) \right ] \right \}  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} ( \mathbf{r} , t ) = \hat { \mathbf{z} } \times \mathbf{E} ( \mathbf{r} , t )/c   &lt;/math&gt;

for the magnetic field, where k is the [[wavenumber]],

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_{ }^{ } = c k&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[angular frequency]] of the wave, and &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]].

Here &lt;math&gt;  \mid\mathbf{E}\mid    &lt;/math&gt; is the [[amplitude]] of the field and

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \begin{pmatrix} \psi_x  \\ \psi_y   \end{pmatrix} =   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_x \right )   \\ \sin\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_y \right )   \end{pmatrix}   &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Jones vector]] in the x-y plane.

The wave is linearly polarized when the phase angles &lt;math&gt; \alpha_x^{ } , \alpha_y &lt;/math&gt; are equal,

:&lt;math&gt;    \alpha_x =  \alpha_y \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \alpha    &lt;/math&gt;.

This represents a wave polarized at an angle &lt;math&gt; \theta    &lt;/math&gt; with respect to the x axis. In that case, the Jones vector can be written

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle  =   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta    \\ \sin\theta   \end{pmatrix} \exp \left ( i \alpha \right )   &lt;/math&gt;.

The state vectors for linear polarization in x or y are special cases of this state vector.

If unit vectors are defined such that

:&lt;math&gt;   |x\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\    \begin{pmatrix} 1    \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}    &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;   |y\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\    \begin{pmatrix} 0    \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}    &lt;/math&gt;

then the polarization state can be written in the &quot;x-y basis&quot; as

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle  =  \cos\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha \right ) |x\rangle + \sin\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha \right ) |y\rangle = \psi_x |x\rangle + \psi_y |y\rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''line code''' is a pattern of voltage, current, or photons used to represent digital data [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmitted]] down a [[transmission line]]. This repertoire of signals is usually called a '''constrained code''' in data storage systems. Some signals are more prone to error than others when conveyed over a [[communication channel]] as the physics of the communication or [[storage medium]] constrains the repertoire of signals that can be used reliably.&lt;ref name=&quot;optics&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

Common line encodings are [[Unipolar encoding|unipolar]], [[Polar encoding|polar]], [[Bipolar encoding|bipolar]], and [[Manchester code]].

== Transmission and storage ==
After line coding, the signal is put through a physical communication channel, either a [[transmission medium]] or [[data storage medium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;paulsen&quot;&gt;Karl Paulsen.

* the line-coded signal can directly be put on a [[transmission line]], in the form of variations of the voltage or current (often using [[differential signaling]]).
* the line-coded signal (the ''[[baseband]] signal'') undergoes further [[pulse shaping]] (to reduce its frequency bandwidth) and then [[modulation|modulated]] (to shift its frequency) to create an ''[[RF signal]]'' that can be sent through free space.
* the line-coded signal can be used to turn on and off a light source in [[free-space optical communication]], most commonly used in an infrared [[remote control]].
* the line-coded signal can be printed on paper to create a [[bar code]].
* the line-coded signal can be converted to magnetized spots on a [[hard drive]] or [[tape drive]].
* the line-coded signal can be converted to pits on an [[optical disc]].

Some of the more common binary line codes include:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-

|-
| NRZ–L || [[Non-return-to-zero]] level. This is the standard positive logic signal format used in digital circuits.

[[File:Binary Line Code Waveforms.png|framed|center|An arbitrary bit pattern in various binary line code formats]]

Each line code has advantages and disadvantages. Line codes are chosen to meet one or more of the following criteria:
* Minimize transmission hardware
* Facilitate synchronization
* Ease error detection and correction
* Achieve a target [[spectral density]]
* Eliminate a [[DC component]]

== Disparity ==
Most long-distance communication channels cannot reliably transport a [[DC component]]. The DC component is also called the ''disparity'', the ''bias'', or the [[DC coefficient]]. The disparity of a bit pattern is the difference in the number of one bits vs the number of zero bits. The ''running disparity'' is the [[running total]] of the disparity of all previously transmitted bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document |author=Jens Kröger |url=https://www.psi.ch/mu3e/ThesesEN/BachelorKroeger.pdf |title=Data Transmission at High Rates via Kapton Flexprints for the Mu3e Experiment |date=2014 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest possible line code, [[Unipolar encoding|unipolar]], gives too many errors on such systems, because it has an unbounded DC component.

Most line codes eliminate the DC component{{snd}} such codes are called [[DC-balanced]], zero-DC, or DC-free. There are three ways of eliminating the DC component:

* Use a [[constant-weight code]]. Each transmitted [[code word]] in a constant-weight code is designed such that every code word that contains some positive or negative levels also contains enough of the opposite levels, such that the average level over each code word is zero. Examples of constant-weight codes include [[Manchester code]] and [[Interleaved 2 of 5]].
* Use a [[paired disparity code]]. Each code word in a paired disparity code that averages to a negative level is paired with another code word that averages to a positive level. The transmitter keeps track of the running DC buildup, and picks the code word that pushes the DC level back towards zero. The receiver is designed so that either code word of the pair decodes to the same data bits. Examples of paired disparity codes include [[alternate mark inversion]], [[8B10B]] and [[4B3T]].
* Use a [[scrambler]]. For example, the scrambler specified in RFC 2615 for [[64b/66b encoding]].

== Polarity ==
Bipolar line codes have two polarities, are generally implemented as RZ, and have a radix of three since there are three distinct output levels (negative, positive and zero). One of the principle advantages of this type of code is that it can completely eliminate any DC component. This is important if the signal must pass through a transformer or a long transmission line.

Unfortunately, several long-distance communication channels have polarity ambiguity. Polarity-insensitive line codes compensate in these channels.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
There are three ways of providing unambiguous reception of 0 and 1 bits over such channels:
* Pair each code word with the polarity-inverse of that code word. The receiver is designed so that either code word of the pair decodes to the same data bits. Examples include [[alternate mark inversion]], [[Differential Manchester encoding]], [[coded mark inversion]] and [[Miller encoding]].
* [[differential coding]] each symbol relative to the previous symbol. Examples include [[MLT-3 encoding]] and [[NRZI]].
* Invert the whole stream when inverted [[syncword]]s are detected

==Run-length limited codes==
For reliable [[clock recovery]] at the receiver, a [[Run-length limited|run-length limitation]] may be imposed on the generated channel sequence, i.e., the maximum number of consecutive ones or zeros is bounded to a reasonable number. A clock period is recovered by observing transitions in the received sequence, so that a maximum run length guarantees sufficient transitions to assure clock recovery quality.

RLL codes are defined by four main parameters: ''m'', ''n'', ''d'', ''k''. The first two, ''m''/''n'', refer to the rate of the code, while the remaining two specify the minimal ''d'' and maximal ''k'' number of zeroes between consecutive ones. This is used in both [[telecommunication]] and storage systems that move a medium past a fixed [[recording head]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal 
|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE
|volume=78 
|issue=11 
|date=December 1990 |title=Runlength-Limited Sequences
|author=Kees Schouhamer Immink
|authorlink=Kees Schouhamer Immink 
|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2984369
|pages=1745–1759
|quote=A detailed description is furnished of the limiting properties of runlength limited sequences.
 |doi=10.1109/5.63306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, RLL bounds the length of stretches (runs) of repeated bits during which the signal does not change.  If the runs are too long, clock recovery is difficult; if they are too short, the high frequencies might be attenuated by the communications channel.  By [[Modulation|modulating]] the [[data]], RLL reduces the timing uncertainty in decoding the stored data, which would lead to the possible erroneous insertion or removal of bits when reading the data back. This mechanism ensures that the boundaries between bits can always be accurately found (preventing [[bit slip]]), while efficiently using the media to reliably store the maximal amount of data in a given space.

Early disk drives used very simple encoding schemes, such as RLL (0,1) FM code, followed by RLL (1,3) MFM code which were widely used in [[hard disk drive]]s until the mid-1980s and are still used in digital optical discs such as [[CD]], [[DVD]], [[Minidisc|MD]], [[Hi-MD]] and [[Blu-ray]] using [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFM]] and [[EFMPLus]] codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Synchronization ==
{{main|Clock recovery}}

Line coding should make it possible for the receiver to synchronize itself to the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the received signal. If the clock recovery is not ideal, then the signal to be decoded will not be sampled at the optimal times. This will increase the probability of error in the received data.

Biphase line codes require at least one transition per bit time. This makes it easier to synchronize the transceivers and detect errors, however, the baud rate is greater than that of NRZ codes.

== Other considerations ==
A line code will typically reflect technical requirements of the transmission medium, such as [[optical fiber]] or [[shielded twisted pair]].  These requirements are unique for each medium, because each one has different behavior related to interference, distortion, capacitance and loss of amplitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=On_Hh23IXDUC&amp;pg=PA284 |title=Network Dictionary |last=Dong |first=Jielin |date=2007 |publisher=Javvin Technologies Inc. |isbn=9781602670006 |language=en |page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adaptive [[high-frequency]] (HF) [[radio]], '''link quality analysis''' ('''LQA''') is the overall process by which measurements of [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] quality are made, assessed, and analyzed.

In LQA, signal quality is determined by measuring, assessing, and analyzing [[Data link|link]] parameters, such as [[bit error ratio]] (BER), and the levels of the ratio of signal-plus-[[noise]]-plus-[[distortion]] to noise-plus-distortion ([[SINAD]]). Measurements are stored at—and exchanged between—stations, for use in making decisions about link establishment.

For adaptive HF radio, LQA is automatically performed and is usually based on analyses of pseudo-BERs and SINAD readings.

A '''loading coil''' or '''load coil''' is an [[inductor]] that is inserted into an [[electronic circuit]] to increase its [[inductance]]. The term originated in the 19th century for inductors used to prevent signal distortion in long-distance telegraph transmission cables. The term is also used for inductors in [[antenna (radio)|radio antenna]]s, or between the antenna and its [[feedline]], to make an [[electrically short]] antenna [[resonance|resonant]] at its operating frequency.

The concept of loading coils was discovered by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in studying the problem of slow signalling speed of the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] in the 1860s. He concluded additional inductance was required to prevent amplitude and time delay distortion of the transmitted signal.  The mathematical condition for distortion-free transmission is known as the [[Heaviside condition]].  Previous telegraph lines were overland or shorter and hence had less delay, and the need for extra inductance was not as great.  [[Submarine communications cable]]s are particularly subject to the problem, but early 20th century installations using [[balanced pair]]s were often continuously loaded with iron wire or tape rather than discretely with loading coils, which avoided the sealing problem.

Loading coils are historically also known as '''Pupin coils''' after [[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin|Mihajlo Pupin]], especially when used for the Heaviside condition and the process of inserting them is sometimes called ''pupinization''.

The capacitors are not discrete components but represent the distributed capacitance between the closely spaced wire conductors of the line, this is indicated by the dotted lines.  The loading coils prevent the audio (voice) signal from being distorted by the line capacitance.  The windings of the loading coil are wound such that the magnetic flux induced in the core is in the same direction for both windings.]]

}}

A common application of loading coils is to improve the [[voice frequency|voice-frequency]] amplitude response characteristics of the [[twisted pair|twisted balanced pairs]] in a telephone cable.  Because twisted pair is a [[balanced line|balanced]] format, half the loading coil must be inserted in each leg of the pair to maintain the balance.  It is common for both these windings to be formed on the same core.  This increases the [[magnetic flux|flux]] linkages, without which the number of turns on the coil would need to be increased. Despite the use of common cores, such loading coils do not comprise [[transformer]]s, as they do not provide [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]] to other circuits.

Loading coils inserted periodically in series with a pair of wires reduce the [[attenuation]] at the higher voice frequencies up to the [[cutoff frequency]] of the [[low-pass filter]] formed by the inductance of the coils (plus the distributed inductance of the wires) and the distributed capacitance between the wires. Above the cutoff frequency, attenuation increases rapidly.  The shorter the distance between the coils, the higher the cut-off frequency.  The cutoff effect is an artifact of using [[lumped-element model|lumped]] inductors.  With loading methods using continuous [[distributed-element model|distributed]] inductance there is no cutoff.

Without loading coils, the line response is dominated by the resistance and capacitance of the line with the attenuation gently increasing with frequency.  With loading coils of exactly the right inductance, neither capacitance nor inductance dominate: the response is flat, [[waveform]]s are undistorted and the [[characteristic impedance]] is resistive up to the cutoff frequency.  The coincidental formation of an [[audio frequency]] filter is also beneficial in that noise is reduced.

====DSL====
With loading coils, signal attenuation of a circuit remains low for signals within the [[passband]] of the transmission line but increases rapidly for frequencies above the audio cutoff frequency. If the telephone line is subsequently reused to support applications that require higher frequencies, such as in analog or digital [[carrier system]]s or [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL), loading coils must be removed or replaced.  Using coils with parallel capacitors forms a filter with the topology of an [[m-derived filter]] and a band of frequencies above the cut-off is also passed. Without removal, for subscribers at an extended distance, e.g., over 4 miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) from the central office, DSL cannot be supported.

====Carrier systems====
American early and middle 20th century telephone cables had load coils at intervals of a mile (1.61&amp;nbsp;km), usually in coil cases holding many.  The coils had to be removed to pass higher frequencies, but the coil cases provided convenient places for repeaters of digital [[T-carrier]] systems, which could then transmit a 1.5 Mbit/s signal that distance.  Due to narrower streets and higher cost of copper, European cables had thinner wires and used closer spacing.  Intervals of a kilometer allowed European systems to carry 2 Mbit/s.

===Radio antenna===
[[File:CB antenna.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A typical mobile antenna with a center-placed loading coil]]
[[File:Large antenna loading coil.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|An enormous antenna loading coil used in a powerful [[longwave]] [[radiotelegraphy|radiotelegraph]] station in New Jersey in 1912.]]
Another type of loading coil is used in radio [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s.  [[Monopole antenna|Monopole]] and [[dipole antenna|dipole]] radio antennas are designed to act as [[resonator]]s for radio waves; the power from the transmitter, applied to the antenna through the antenna's [[transmission line]], excites [[standing wave]]s of voltage and current in the antenna element. To be “naturally” resonant, the antenna must have a physical length of one quarter of the [[wavelength]] of the radio waves used (or a multiple of that length, with odd multiples usually preferred). At resonance the antenna acts electrically as a pure [[electrical resistance|resistance]], absorbing all the power applied to it from the transmitter.

In many cases for practical reasons it is necessary to make the antenna shorter than the resonant length, this is called an [[electrically short]] antenna. An antenna shorter than a quarter wavelength presents [[capacitive reactance]] to the transmission line. Some of the applied power is reflected back into the transmission line and travels back toward the transmitter. The two currents at the same frequency running in opposite directions causes [[standing wave]]s on the transmission line, measured as a [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR) greater than one. The elevated currents waste energy by heating the wire, and can even overheat the transmitter.

To make an [[electrical length|electrically short]] antenna resonant, a loading coil is inserted in series with the antenna. The coil is built to have an [[inductive reactance]] equal and opposite to the capacitive reactance of the short antenna, so the combination of reactances cancels. When so loaded the antenna presents a pure resistance to the transmission line, preventing energy from being reflected. The loading coil is often placed at the base of the antenna, between it and the transmission line (''base loading''), but for more efficient radiation, it is sometimes inserted in the center of the antenna element itself (''center loading'').

Loading coils for powerful transmitters can have challenging design requirements, especially at low frequencies. The [[radiation resistance]] of short antennas can be very low, as low a few ohms in the [[low frequency|LF]] or [[very low frequency|VLF]] bands, where antennas are commonly short and inductive loading is most needed. Because resistance in the coil winding is comparable to, or exceeds the radiation resistance, loading coils for extremely electrically short antennas must have extremely low AC [[electrical resistance|resistance]] at the operating frequency. To reduce [[skin effect]] losses the coil is often made of tubing or [[Litz wire]], with single layer windings, with turns spaced apart to reduce [[Proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] resistance. They must often handle high voltages. To reduce power lost in [[dielectric loss]]es, the coil is often suspended in air supported on thin ceramic strips. The capacitively loaded antennas used at low frequencies have extremely narrow bandwidths, and therefore if the frequency is changed the loading coil must be adjustable to tune the antenna to resonance with the new transmitter frequency. [[Inductor|Variometers]] are often used.

===Bulk power transmission===
To reduce losses due to high capacitance on long-distance [[Electric power transmission#Bulk power transmission|bulk power transmission lines]], inductance can be introduced to the circuit with a [[flexible AC transmission system]] (FACTS), a [[static VAR compensator]], or a [[static synchronous series compensator]]. Series compensation can be thought of as an inductor connected to the circuit in series if it is supplying inductance to the circuit.

==Campbell equation==
The Campbell equation is a relationship due to [[George Ashley Campbell]] for predicting the [[propagation constant]] of a loaded line.  It is stated as;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p43&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cosh (\gamma'd) = \cosh (\gamma d) + \frac{Z}{2Z_0} \sinh (\gamma d)&lt;/math&gt;

:where,

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the propagation constant of the unloaded line
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma ' \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the propagation constant of the loaded line
:&lt;math&gt;d \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the interval between coils on the loaded line
:&lt;math&gt;Z \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance of a loading coil and
:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic impedance of the unloaded line.

A more engineer friendly rule of thumb is that the approximate requirement for spacing loading coils is ten coils per wavelength of the maximum frequency being transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p42&lt;/ref&gt;  This approximation can be arrived at by treating the loaded line as a [[constant k filter]] and applying [[image impedance|image filter theory]] to it.  From basic image filter theory the angular cutoff frequency and the characteristic impedance of a [[low-pass filter|low-pass]] constant k filter are given by;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L_{\frac{1}{2}} C_{\frac{1}{2}}}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and,&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L_{\frac{1}{2}}}{C_{\frac{1}{2}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;L_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are the half section element values.

From these basic equations the necessary loading coil inductance and coil spacing can be found;

:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{Z_0}{\omega_c}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and,&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;d = \frac{2}{\omega_c Z_0 C}&lt;/math&gt;

:where C is the capacitance per unit length of the line.

Expressing this in terms of number of coils per cutoff wavelength yields;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_c}{d} = \pi v Z_0 C&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''v'' is the velocity of propagation of the cable in question.

Since &lt;math&gt;v = {1 \over Z_0 C}&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_c}{d} = \pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Campbell arrived at this expression by analogy with a mechanical line periodically loaded with weights described by Charles Godfrey in 1898 who obtained a similar result.  Mechanical loaded lines of this sort were first studied by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] (1736–1813).&lt;ref&gt;Mason, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of cutoff whereby frequencies above the cutoff frequency are not transmitted is an undesirable side effect of loading coils (although it proved highly useful in [[Passive analogue filter development|the development of filters]]).  Cutoff is avoided by the use of continuous loading since it arises from the lumped nature of the loading coils.&lt;ref&gt;Bakshi &amp; Bakshi, p1.56&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Oliver Heaviside===
[[File:Heaviside cropped.png|thumb|Oliver Heaviside]]
The origin of the loading coil can be found in the work of [[Oliver Heaviside]] on the theory of [[transmission line]]s.  Heaviside (1881) represented the line as a network of infinitesimally small circuit elements.  By applying his [[operational calculus]] to the analysis of this network he discovered (1887) what has become known as the [[Heaviside condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, O, &quot;Electromagnetic Induction and its propagation&quot;, ''The Electrician'', 3 June 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, O, ''Electrical Papers'', '''vol 1''', pp139-140, Boston, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the condition that must be fulfilled in order for a transmission line to be free from [[distortion]].  The Heaviside condition is that the series [[electrical impedance|impedance]], Z, must be proportional to the shunt [[admittance]], Y, at all frequencies.  In terms of the [[primary line coefficients]] the condition is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{G}=\frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

:where;

:&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the series resistance of the line per unit length
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the series self-inductance of the line per unit length
:&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the shunt leakage [[Electrical resistance and conductance|conductance]] of the line insulator per unit length
:&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the shunt capacitance between the line conductors per unit length

Heaviside was aware that this condition was not met in the practical telegraph cables in use in his day.  In general, a real cable would have,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{G} \gg \frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

This is mainly due to the low value of leakage through the cable insulator, which is even more pronounced in modern cables which have better insulators than in Heaviside's day.  In order to meet the condition, the choices are therefore to try to increase G or L or to decrease R or C.  Decreasing R requires larger conductors.  Copper was already in use in telegraph cables and this is the very best conductor available short of using silver.  Decreasing R means using more copper and a more expensive cable.  Decreasing C would also mean a larger cable (although not necessarily more copper).  Increasing G is highly undesirable; while it would reduce distortion, it would at the same time increase the signal loss.  Heaviside considered, but rejected, this possibility which left him with the strategy of increasing L as the way to reduce distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, pp39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaviside immediately (1887) proposed several methods of increasing the inductance, including spacing the conductors further apart and loading the insulator with iron dust.  Finally, Heaviside made the proposal (1893) to use discrete inductors at intervals along the line.&lt;ref&gt;''The Electrician'', 1887 and reproduced (according to Brittain) in Heaviside, O, ''Electromagnetic Theory'', p.112&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he never succeeded in persuading the British [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|GPO]] to take up the idea.  Brittain attributes this to Heaviside's failure to provide engineering details on the size and spacing of the coils for particular cable parameters.  Heaviside's eccentric character and setting himself apart from the establishment may also have played a part in their ignoring of him.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p40&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Stone===
[[John Stone Stone|John S. Stone]] worked for the [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company]] (AT&amp;T) and was the first to attempt to apply Heaviside's ideas to real telecommunications.  Stone's idea (1896) was to use a bimetallic iron-copper cable which he had patented.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M S, ''Electric Circuit'', US patent 0 578 275, filed 10 September 1896, issued 2 March 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;  This cable of Stone's would increase the line inductance due to the iron content and had the potential to meet the Heaviside condition.  However, Stone left the company in 1899 and the idea was never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain pp40-41&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone's cable was an example of continuous loading, a principle that was eventually put into practice is other forms, see for instance [[#Krarup cable|Krarup cable]] later in this article.

===George Campbell===
[[George Ashley Campbell|George Campbell]] was another AT&amp;T engineer working in their Boston facility.  Campbell was tasked with continuing the investigation into Stone's bimetallic cable, but soon abandoned it in favour of the loading coil. His was an independent discovery: Campbell was aware of Heaviside's work in discovering the Heaviside condition, but unaware of Heaviside's suggestion of using loading coils to enable a line to meet it.  The motivation for the change of direction was Campbell's limited budget.

Campbell was struggling to set up a practical demonstration over a real telephone route with the budget he had been allocated.  After considering that his artificial line simulators used [[lumped-element model|lumped]] components rather than the [[distributed-element model|distributed]] quantities found in a real line, he wondered if he could not insert the inductance with lumped components instead of using Stone's distributed line.  When his calculations showed that the manholes on telephone routes were sufficiently close together to be able to insert the loading coils without the expense of either having to dig up the route or lay in new cables he changed to this new plan.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, pp42-45&lt;/ref&gt;  The very first demonstration of loading coils on a telephone cable was on a 46-mile length of the so-called Pittsburgh cable (the test was actually in Boston, the cable had previously been used for testing in Pittsburgh) on 6 September 1899 carried out by Campbell himself and his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;  The first telephone cable using loaded lines put into public service was between Jamaica Plain and West Newton in Boston on 18 May 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain p45&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell's work on loading coils provided the theoretical basis for his subsequent work on filters which proved to be so important for [[frequency-division multiplexing]].  The cut-off phenomena of loading coils, an undesirable side-effect, can be exploited to produce a desirable filter frequency response.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, G A, &quot;Physical Theory of the Electric Wave-Filter&quot;, ''Bell System Tech J'', November 1922, vol 1, no 2, pp 1-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Pupin===
[[File:Pupin coil.png|thumb|left|Pupin's design of loading coil]]
[[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin|Michael Pupin]], inventor and [[Serbia]]n immigrant to the USA, also played a part in the story of loading coils.  Pupin filed a rival patent to the one of Campbell's.&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M, ''Art of Reducing Attenuation of Electrical Waves and Apparatus Therefor'', US patent 0 652 230, filed 14 December 1899, issued 19 June 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;  This patent of Pupin's dates from 1899.  There is an earlier patent&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M, ''Apparatus for Telegraphic of Telephonic Transmission'', US patent 0 519 346, filed 14 December 1893, issued 8 May 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; (1894, filed December 1893) which is sometimes cited as Pupin's loading coil patent but is, in fact, something different.  The confusion is easy to understand, Pupin himself claims that he first thought of the idea of loading coils while climbing a mountain in 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M I, ''From Immigrant to Inventor'', pp330-331, Charles Schribner &amp; Sons, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; although there is nothing from him published at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p46&lt;/ref&gt;

Pupin's 1894 patent &quot;loads&quot; the line with capacitors rather than inductors, a scheme that has been criticised as being theoretically flawed&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p46, quoting a contemporary criticism in ''Electrical Review'' and experiments by the [[General Post Office|GPO]] showing that the scheme does not work&lt;/ref&gt; and never put into practice.  To add to the confusion, one variant of the capacitor scheme proposed by Pupin does indeed have coils.  However, these are not intended to compensate the line in any way.  They are there merely to restore DC continuity to the line so that it may be tested with standard equipment.  Pupin states that the inductance is to be so large that it blocks all AC signals above 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, 1894, p5 lines 75-83&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, only the capacitor is adding any significant impedance to the line and &quot;the coils will not exercise any material influence on the results before noted&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, 1894, p5 lines 123-125&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

===Legal battle===
Heaviside never patented his idea; indeed, he took no commercial advantage of any of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Bray, p53&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the legal disputes surrounding this invention, it is unquestionable that Campbell was the first to actually construct a telephone circuit using loading coils.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain p56&lt;/ref&gt;  There also can be little doubt that Heaviside was the first to publish and many would dispute Pupin's priority.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p36, 48-50&lt;br/&gt;Behrend to Searle, in letter quoted by Brittain, p37&lt;br/&gt;Searle to Behrend, 1931, in letter quoted by Brittain, p37&lt;br/&gt;Nahin, p276&lt;/ref&gt;

AT&amp;T fought a legal battle with Pupin over his claim.  Pupin was first to patent but Campbell had already conducted practical demonstrations before Pupin had even filed his patent (December 1899).&lt;ref&gt;Pupin, M I, ''Art of Reducing Attenuation of Electrical Waves and Apparatus Therefore'', US patent 0 652 230,  filed 14 December 1899, issued 19 June 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell's delay in filing was due to the slow internal machinations of AT&amp;T.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p44&lt;/ref&gt;

However, AT&amp;T foolishly deleted from Campbell's proposed patent application all the tables and graphs detailing the exact value of inductance that would be required before the patent was submitted.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain p44-45&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Pupin's patent contained a (less accurate) formula, AT&amp;T was open to claims of incomplete disclosure.  Fearing that there was a risk that the battle would end with the invention being declared unpatentable due to Heaviside's prior publication, they decided to desist from the challenge and buy an option on Pupin's patent for a yearly fee so that AT&amp;T would control both patents.  By January 1901 Pupin had been paid $200,000 ($13 million in 2011&lt;ref name=Worth&gt;Samuel H. Williamson, &quot;Seven Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.S. Dollar Amount, 1774 to present&quot; (Contemporary Standard of Living measure) ''MeasuringWorth'', April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;) and by 1917, when the AT&amp;T monopoly ended and payments ceased, he had received a total of $455,000 ($25 million in 2011&lt;ref name=Worth/&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p54, p55 (footnote), p57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefit to AT&amp;T===
The invention was of enormous value to AT&amp;T.  Telephone cables could now be used to twice the distance previously possible, or alternatively, a cable of half the previous quality (and cost) could be used over the same distance.  When considering whether to allow Campbell to go ahead with the demonstration, their engineers had estimated that they stood to save $700,000 in new installation costs in New York and New Jersey alone.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p45&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated that AT&amp;T saved $100 million in the first quarter of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, p36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, T &amp; Fondiller, W, &quot;Developments and Applications of Loading for Telephone Circuits&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers'', '''vol 45''', pp291-292, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heaviside, who began it all, came away with nothing.  He was offered a token payment but would not accept, wanting the credit for his work.  He remarked ironically that if his prior publication had been admitted it would &quot;interfere ... with the flow of dollars in the proper direction ...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brittain quoting Heaviside letter to Behrend, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Loaded submarine cable}}

===Submarine cables===
Distortion is a particular problem for [[submarine communication cable]]s, partly because their great length allows more distortion to build up, but also because they are more susceptible to distortion than open wires on poles due to the characteristics of the insulating material.  Different wavelengths of the signal travel at different velocities in the material causing [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]].  It was this problem on the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] that motivated Heaviside to study the problem and find the solution.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;  Loading coils solve the dispersion problem, and the first use of them on a submarine cable was in 1906 by [[Siemens and Halske]] in a cable across [[Lake Constance]].&lt;ref&gt;Newell, p. 478&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of difficulties using loading coils with heavy submarine cables.  The bulge of the loading coils could not easily pass through the cable laying apparatus of [[cable ship]]s and the ship had to slow down during the laying of a loading coil.&lt;ref&gt;Newell, p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;  Discontinuities where the coils were installed caused stresses in the cable during laying.  Without great care, the cable might part and would be difficult to repair. A further problem was that the material science of the time had difficulties sealing the joint between coil and cable against ingress of seawater.  When this occurred the cable was ruined.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;  Continuous loading was developed to overcome these problems, which also has the benefit of not having a cutoff frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Newell, p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

===Krarup cable===
A Danish engineer, [[Carl Emil Krarup]], invented a form of continuously loaded cable which solved the problems of discrete loading coils.  Krarup cable has iron wires continuously wound around the central copper conductor with adjacent turns in contact with each other.  This cable was the first use of continuous loading on any telecommunication cable.&lt;ref&gt;Kragh, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1902, Krarup both wrote his paper on this subject and saw the installation of the first cable between [[Helsingør]] (Denmark) and [[Helsingborg]] (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;Huurderman, pp. 321-322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permalloy cable===
[[File:Permalloy loaded cable construction.svg|thumb|right|300px|Permalloy cable construction]]
Even though the Krarup cable added inductance to the line, this was insufficient to meet the Heaviside condition. AT&amp;T searched for a better material with higher [[permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]].  In 1914, Gustav Elmen discovered [[permalloy]], a magnetic nickel-iron annealed alloy. In c. 1915, [[Oliver E. Buckley]], [[Harold D. Arnold|H. D. Arnold]], and Elmen, all at [[Bell Labs]], greatly improved transmission speeds by suggesting a method of constructing [[submarine communications cable]] using permalloy tape wrapped around the copper conductors.&lt;ref name=Huurd314&gt;Huurdeman, p.314&lt;/ref&gt;

The cable was tested in a trial in Bermuda in 1923. The first permalloy cable placed in service connected [[New York City]] and [[Horta (Azores)]] in September 1924.&lt;ref name=Huurd314/&gt;  Permalloy cable enabled signalling speed on submarine telegraph cables to be increased to 400 words/min at a time when 40 words/min was considered good.&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, p.308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Huurdeman has apparently read 2000 characters per minute as 2000 words per minute --&gt;  The first transatlantic cable achieved only two words/min.&lt;ref&gt;May, pages 947, 950&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mu-metal cable===
[[File:Mu metal submarine telegraph cable construction.svg|thumb|left|300px|Mu-metal cable construction]]
[[Mu-metal]] has similar magnetic properties to permalloy but the addition of copper to the alloy increases the ductility and allows the metal to be drawn into wire.  Mu-metal cable is easier to construct than permalloy cable, the mu-metal being wound around the core copper conductor in much the same way as the iron wire in Krarup cable.  A further advantage with mu-metal cable is that the construction lends itself to a variable loading profile whereby the loading is tapered towards the ends.

Mu-metal was invented in 1923 by the [[Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company]], London,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, WS, Garnett, HJ, ''New and improved magnetic alloys, and their application in the manufacture of telegraphic and telephonic cables'', Patent GB224972, filed 25 Aug 1923, issued 25 Nov 1925.  patented in the US as US1582353 and US1552769&lt;/ref&gt; who made the cable, initially, for the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Co]].  Western Union were in competition with AT&amp;T and the [[Western Electric Company]] who were using permalloy.  The patent for permalloy was held by Western Electric which prevented Western Union from using it.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Green, &quot;150 Years Of Industry &amp; Enterprise At [[Enderby's Wharf]]&quot; paper presented at University College, July 2004, for ''History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Undersea Communications'' [http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/EnderbyAG/index.htm retrieved] 16 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patch loading===
Continuous loading of cables is expensive and hence is only done when absolutely necessary.  Lumped loading with coils is cheaper but has the disadvantages of difficult seals and a definite cutoff frequency.  A compromise scheme is '''patch loading''' whereby the cable is continuously loaded in repeated sections.  The intervening sections are left unloaded.&lt;ref&gt;Bakshi &amp; Bakshi, p1.55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current practice===
Loaded cable is no longer a useful technology for submarine communication cables, having first been superseded by [[coaxial cable|co-axial cable]] using electrically powered in-line [[repeater]]s and then by [[optical fiber|fibre-optic cable]].  Manufacture of loaded cable declined in the 1930s and was then superseded by other technologies post-war.  Loading coils can still be found in some telephone landlines today but new installations use more modern technology.

[[Image:LATAs.png|thumb|right|350px|Map of LATAs in the US]] 
'''Local access and transport area''' ('''LATA''') is a term used in U.S. telecommunications regulation.  It represents a geographical area of the United States under the terms of the [[Modification of Final Judgment]] (MFJ) entered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Civil Action number 82-0192 or any other geographic area designated as a LATA in the [[National Exchange Carrier Association]], Inc. Tariff FCC No. 4. that precipitated the breakup of the original [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] into the &quot;[[Regional Bell Operating Company|Baby Bells]]&quot; or created since that time for [[Plain old telephone service|wireline]] regulation.

Generally, a LATA represents an area within which a [[divested]] [[Regional Bell Operating Company]] (RBOC) is permitted to offer [[telephone exchange|exchange]] telecommunications and exchange access services. Under the terms of the MFJ, the RBOCs are generally prohibited from providing services that originate in one LATA and terminate in another.

LATA boundaries tend to be drawn around markets, and not necessarily along existing [[U.S. state|state]] or [[Telephone numbering plan#Area code|area code]] borders. Some LATAs cross over state boundaries, such as those for the [[New York metropolitan area]] and [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]; [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; and areas between [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], and [[West Virginia]]. Area codes and LATAs do not necessarily share boundaries; many LATAs exist in multiple area codes, and many area codes exist in multiple LATAs.

Originally, the LATAs were grouped into regions within which one particular RBOC was allowed to provide services. The LATAs in each of these regions are numbered beginning with the same digit. Generally, the LATAs were associated with [[telephone carrier|carrier]]s or other indications in the following manner:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Digit||Area/Use||[[RBOC]]
|-
|0xx||unused||
|-
|1xx||[[New York (state)|New York]] &amp; [[New England]]||[[NYNEX]] (now [[Verizon]] and [[Consolidated Communications]])
|-
|2xx||[[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]]||[[Bell Atlantic]] (now Verizon and [[Frontier West Virginia|Frontier]])
|-
|3xx||[[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes]]||[[Ameritech]] (now [[AT&amp;T Inc.]])
|-
|4xx||[[American Southeast|Southeast]]||[[BellSouth]] (now AT&amp;T Inc.)
|-
|5xx||[[American South Central States|South-central]]||[[Southwestern Bell]] (now AT&amp;T Inc.)
|-
|6xx||[[Pacific Northwest]], [[Midwest]], and [[Rocky Mountains]]||[[US West]] (now [[CenturyLink]])
|-
|7xx||[[California]] and [[Nevada]]||[[Pacific Bell]] (now AT&amp;T Inc.)
|-
|8xx||Non-contiguous and international areas||
|-
|9xx||Other/Expansion||
|}

In addition to this list, two local carriers were made independent: [[Cincinnati Bell]] in the [[Cincinnati]] area, and [[Southern New England Telephone|SNET]] (a former unit of AT&amp;T, sold to [[Frontier Communications|Frontier]]) in [[Connecticut]]. These were assigned LATAs in the 9xx range.

Since the [[Modification of Final Judgment|breakup of the original AT&amp;T]] in 1984, however, some amount of [[deregulation]], as well as a number of phone company [[merger]]s, have blurred the significance of these regions. A number of new LATAs have been formed within these regions since their inception, most beginning with the digit 9.

LATAs contribute to an often confusing aspect of [[long–distance calling|long–distance]] telephone service. Due to the various and overlapping regulatory limitations and inter-business arrangements, phone companies typically provide differing types of “long distance” service, each with potentially different rates:
* within same LATA, within same state
* within same LATA, between different states
* between different LATAs, within same state
* between different LATAs, between different states
Given the complexity of the legal and financial issues involved in each distinction, many long-distance companies tend to not explain the details of these different rates, which can lead to billing questions from surprised customers.

Local carriers have various alternative terms for LATAs such as “Service Area” by Pacific Bell in California, or “Regional Calling Area” by Verizon in Maryland.

In order to facilitate the sharing of [[Telcordia]] telephone routing databases between countries, LATAs were later defined for the provinces of [[Canada]], the other countries and territories of the [[North American Numbering Plan]], and [[Mexico]]. Aside from U.S. territories, LATAs have no regulatory purpose in these areas. In 2000, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] eliminated all Canadian provincial LATAs in favor of a single LATA for Canada (888).

No LATAs exist with a second digit of 0 or 1, which distinguished them from traditional [[Numbering plan area|area codes]].

==List of LATAs==

===US state LATAs===
The city or place name given with some LATAs is the name given to identify the LATA, not the limit of its boundary. Generally this is the most significant metropolitan area in the LATA. In some cases, a LATA is named after the largest phone exchange in the LATA that was historically served by an RBOC. For example, the largest city in the Pahrump LATA in Nevada is [[Las Vegas]]. Since Las Vegas was not historically served by an RBOC, the LATA is named after the smaller town of Pahrump, which was historically served by Nevada Bell (now AT&amp;T Inc.). Also, listing under a state does not necessarily limit the LATA's territory to that state; there may be overlaps as well as [[enclave]]s. Areas that include notable portions of other states are explained, but not all LATA state overlaps may be detailed.

LATA boundaries are not always solidly defined. Inter-carrier agreements, change proposals to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), and new wiring developments into rural areas can and do often alter the effective borders between LATAs. Many sources on LATA boundary information conflict with each other at detailed levels. [[Telcordia]] data may provide the most up-to-date details of LATA inclusions.

===U.S. territory LATAs===

*[[American Samoa]] - 884&lt;ref&gt;American Samoa entered the [[North American Numbering Plan|NANP]] in October 2004 and presumably was allocated a LATA by that time. Telcordia LERG data suggests that American Samoa uses LATA 884.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Guam]] - 871
*[[Northern Mariana Islands]] - 870
*[[Puerto Rico]] - 820
*[[U.S. Virgin Islands]] - 822
*[[Wake Island]] - 836

===Non-U.S. LATAs (non-regulatory)===

*[[Mexico]] - 838
*[[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] - 824
*[[Jamaica]] - 826
*[[Dominican Republic]] - 828
*Other [[Caribbean]] - 830
*[[Canada]] - 888

== Canada ==
As LATAs exist for US regulatory purposes, where they serve as a demarcation between intra-LATA calls (handled by regional Bell operating companies) and inter-LATA calls (handled by interstate long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T), they have no legal significance in [[Canada]].

As of 2000, all of Canada (except for non-geographic numbers) is identified as LATA 888.

The use of this LATA set to identify individual provinces is therefore deprecated:
*[[Alberta]] - 881, 884
*[[British Columbia]] - 886
*[[Manitoba]] - 888
*[[New Brunswick]] - 890
*[[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] - 885
*[[Nova Scotia]]/[[Prince Edward Island|P.E.I.]] -  887, 889
*[[Ontario]] - 851
*[[Quebec]] - 850, 883
*[[Saskatchewan]] - 891
*[[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] - 892

===Local interconnection region===
Canada does define '''local interconnection regions''' (LIR's), which determine where points of interconnection (POI) must be provided by [[Competitive local exchange carrier|competing local exchange]] and mobile carriers to provide [[local number portability]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/dt2007-23.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian LIR is geographically smaller than a US LATA, typically comparable in size to a small city's flat-rate local calling area or to an entire large [[regional municipality]]. In areas where a small-city [[Digital Multiplex System]] controls a group of [[remote switching centre]]s, one for each surrounding village, the local interconnect region normally includes each exchange in the city plus all downstream remotes of those exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_listlir.php List of Canadian LIRs] on localcallingguide.com&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Toronto]]-sized city, the LIR will include only the city itself.

While the LIRs resemble local calling areas in geographic size, there are some key differences:
* LIR's normally do not include incumbent local [[independent telephone company]] exchanges in locations not opened to competition, where the independent numbers are currently not portable.
* LIR's do not cross provincial boundaries. [[Lloydminster]] has an LIR for each province, as does [[Ottawa]]-[[Hull, Quebec|Hull]].
* LIR's closely follow network topology, which often does not match a local flat-rate calling area as local calling is defined by arbitrary regulatory constructs.

One example: The tiny unincorporated village of [[Beebe Plain]], divided by the [[Quebec]]-[[Vermont]] border, is served by +1-819-876 [[Rock Island, Quebec]], Canada (a remote station controlled from [[Magog, Quebec|Magog]]) and +1-802-873 [[Derby Line, Vermont]], USA (a remote station controlled from [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St. Johnsbury]]). Magog and St. Johnsbury are both a long-distance call from anywhere in Beebe Plain, even though Canadian subscribers can place local calls to [[Sherbrooke]], US subscribers can locally call [[Newport (city), Vermont|Newport]] and an international call within the village is local. An LIR assignment which follows network topology places the Canadian remote station in Magog's LIR, not Sherbrooke's LIR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_exch.php?exch=172360 Rock Island QC] on localcallingguide.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="1553" xml:space="preserve">In [[telephony]], the term '''local call''' has the following meanings:

# Any [[telephone call|call]] using a single [[switching center]]; that is, not traveling to another telephone network;
# A call made within a local calling area as defined by the [[local exchange carrier]];
# Any call for which an additional charge, ''i.e.'', toll charge, is not billed to the calling or called party, or (depending on the country) for which this charge is reduced because it is a short-distance call (e.g. within a town or local [[metropolitan area]]).

Typically, local calls have shorter numbers than [[long-distance call]]s, as the [[area code]] may not be required. However, this is not true in parts of the United States and Canada that are subject to [[overlay plan]]s or many countries in Europe that require [[closed dialing plans]].

[[Toll free]] (e.g. &quot;800&quot; numbers in the United States) are not necessarily local calls; despite being free to the caller, any charge due for the distance of the connection is charged to the ''called'' party.

Commercial users who make or accept many long-distance calls to or from a particular distant place may make them as local calls by use of a [[Foreign exchange service (telecommunications)|foreign exchange service]]. Such an &quot;FX&quot; line also allows people in the distant place to call by using a telephone number local to them.

[[File:LPDA-Antenna.jpg|thumb|260px|Log-periodic antenna, 400&amp;ndash;4000 MHz]]

{{Antennas|expanded=Common Types}}

A '''log-periodic antenna''' ('''LP'''), also known as a '''log-periodic array''' or '''log-periodic aerial''', is a multi-element, [[directional antenna]] designed to operate over a wide band of [[Frequency|frequencies]]. It was invented by John Dunlavy in 1952.

The most common form of log-periodic antenna is the '''log-periodic dipole array''' or '''LPDA''', The LPDA consists of a number of [[half-wave dipole]] [[driven element]]s of gradually increasing length, each consisting of a pair of metal rods. The dipoles are mounted close together in a line, connected in parallel to the [[feedline]] with alternating [[phase (waves)|phase]]. Electrically, it simulates a series of two or three-element [[Yagi antenna]]s connected together, each set tuned to a different frequency.

LPDA antennas look somewhat similar to Yagi antennas, in that they both consist of dipole rod elements mounted in a line along a support boom, but they work in very different ways. Adding elements to a Yagi increases its directionality, or [[Antenna gain|gain]], while adding elements to a LPDA increases its frequency response, or [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. 

One large application for LPDAs is in rooftop terrestrial [[television antenna]]s, since they must have large bandwidth to cover the wide television bands of roughly 54&amp;ndash;88 and 174&amp;ndash;216&amp;nbsp;MHz in the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and 470&amp;ndash;890&amp;nbsp;MHz in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]  while also having high gain for adequate fringe reception. One widely used design for television reception combined a Yagi for UHF reception in front of a larger LPDA for VHF.

== Basic concept ==

The LPDA normally consists of a series of [[dipole antenna|half wave dipole]] &quot;elements&quot; each consisting of a pair of metal rods, positioned along a support boom lying along the antenna axis. The elements are spaced at intervals following a logarithmic function of the [[frequency]], known as ''d'' or ''sigma''.  The successive elements gradually decrease in length along the boom. The relationship between the lengths is a function known as ''tau''. ''Sigma'' and ''tau'' are the key design elements of the LPDA design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salsburg.com/Log-Periodic.pdf The Log-Periodic Dipole Array&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=d&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/es/Nov1998/13/LPARRAY/LPDA.HTM|title=Log Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA)|website=www.ewh.ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[radiation pattern]] of the antenna is unidirectional, with the [[main lobe]] along the axis of the boom, off the end with the shortest elements.  Each dipole element is [[resonance|resonant]] at a [[wavelength]] approximately equal to twice its length. The [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the antenna, the [[frequency]] range over which it has maximum [[antenna gain|gain]], is approximately between the [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]] of the longest and shortest element.

Every element in the LPDA antenna is a [[driven element]], that is, connected electrically to the [[feedline]].  A parallel wire [[transmission line]] usually runs along the central boom, and each successive element is connected in ''opposite'' [[phase (waves)|phase]] to it.  The feedline can often be seen zig-zagging across the support boom holding the elements.&lt;ref name=d/&gt;  Another common construction method is to use two parallel central support booms that also acts as the transmission line, mounting the dipoles on the alternate booms. Other forms of the log-periodic design replace the dipoles with the transmission line itself, forming the log-periodic zig-zag antenna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.ca/patents/US3355740 &quot;Log-periodic zig zag antenna&quot;], US Patent 3355740&lt;/ref&gt; Many other forms using the transmission wire as the active element also exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ece.illinois.edu/about/history/antenna/photos.html Photo Archive Of Antennas], Illinois Historic Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yagi–Uda antenna|Yagi]] and the LPDA designs look very similar at first glance, as they both consist of a number of dipole elements mounted along a support boom. The Yagi, however, has only a single [[driven element]] connected to the transmission line, usually the second one from the back of the array, the remaining elements are [[parasitic element|parasitic]]. The Yagi antenna differs from the LPDA in having a very narrow bandwidth.

In general terms, at any given frequency the log-periodic design operates somewhat similar to a three-element Yagi antenna; the dipole element closest to resonant at the operating frequency acts as a driven element, with the two adjacent elements on either side as director and reflector to increase the gain, the shorter element in front acting as a director and the longer element behind as a reflector. However, the system is somewhat more complex than that, and all the elements contribute to some degree, so the gain for any given frequency is higher than a Yagi of the same dimensions as any one section of the log-periodic. However, a Yagi with the same number of elements as a log-periodic would have ''far'' higher gain, as all of those elements are improving the gain of a single driven element. In its use as a television antenna, it was common to combine a log-periodic design for VHF with a Yagi for UHF, with both halves being roughly equal in size. This resulted in much higher gain for UHF, typically on the order of 10 to 14&amp;nbsp;dB on the Yagi side and 6.5&amp;nbsp;dB for the log-periodic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jDCs1Ckne_EC&amp;pg=PA177 |page=178 |title= Computational Electromagnetics for RF and Microwave Engineering |first=David |last=Davidson |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2010|isbn=9781139492812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But this extra gain was needed anyway in order to make up for a number of problems with [[UHF television broadcasting#UHF vs VHF|UHF signals]].

It should be strictly noted that the log-periodic shape, according to the IEEE definition,&lt;ref&gt;“''Log-periodic antenna'' Any one of a class of antennas having a structural geometry such that its impedance and radiation characteristics repeat periodically as the logarithm of frequency.” (see ''The new IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms'', 1993 ⓒ IEEE.) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“''Log-periodic antenna'' Any one of a class of antennas having a structural geometry such that its impedance and radiation characteristics repeat periodically as the logarithm of frequency.” (see Acknowledgments, and footnote in page 1), ''Self-Complementary Antennas―Principle of Self-Complementarity for Constant Impedance''―, by Y. Mushiake, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., London, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; does not align with broadband property for antennas.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Mushiake, “Constant-impedance antennas&quot;, ''J. IECE Japan'', 48, 4, pp. 580-584, April 1965. (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sm.rim.or.jp/~ymushiak/sub.non-const.htm|title=Y.

A planar log-periodic antenna can also be made [[self-complementary antenna|self-complementary]], such as logarithmic [[spiral antenna]]s (which are not classified as log-periodic ''per se'' but among the [[frequency independent antennas]] that are also self-similar) or the log-periodic toothed design.

== History ==
The log periodic antenna was invented by John Dunlavy in 1952 while working for the United States Air Force, but was not credited with it due to its &quot;Secret&quot; classification.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stereophile.com/content/loudspeaker-designer-john-dunlavy-numbers-page-4&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] had patented the Isbell and Mayes-Carrel antennas and licensed the design as a package exclusively to JFD Electronics in New York. [[Channel Master]] and [[Blonder Tongue Labs]] ignored the patents and produced a wide range of antennas based on this design. Lawsuits regarding the antenna patent which the UI Foundation lost, evolved into the 1971 Blonder-Tongue Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/b/blonder-tongue-doctrine/|title=Blonder–Tongue Doctrine Law and Legal Definition &amp;#124; USLegal, Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This precedent governs patent litigation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The log periodic is commonly used as a transmitting antenna in high power [[International broadcasting|shortwave broadcasting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antenna.be/art1.html|title=Antennas for the Shortwave Broadcaster|website=www.antenna.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; stations because its broad bandwidth allows a single antenna to transmit on frequencies in multiple [[Shortwave bands#International broadcast bands|bands]]. The log-periodic zig-zag design with up to 16 sections has been used. These large antennas are typically designed to cover 6 to 26&amp;nbsp;MHz but even larger ones have been built which operate as low as 2&amp;nbsp;MHz. Power ratings are available up to 500&amp;nbsp;kW. Instead of the elements being driven in parallel, attached to a central transmission line, the elements are driven in series, adjacent elements connected at the outer edges. The antenna shown here would have about 14&amp;nbsp;dBi [[antenna gain|gain]]. An [[antenna array]] consisting of two such antennas, one above the other and driven in phase has a gain of up to 17&amp;nbsp;dBi. Being log-periodic, the antenna's main characteristics ([[radiation pattern]], gain, [[driving point impedance]]) are almost constant over its entire frequency range, with the match to a 300&amp;nbsp;Ω feed line achieving a [[standing wave ratio]] of better than 2:1 over that range.

      <text bytes="3102" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]], the term '''long-haul communications''' has the following meanings:

'''1.'''  In public switched networks, pertaining to circuits that span large distances, such as the circuits in [[Interexchange carrier|inter-LATA]], interstate, and international [[telecommunication|communications]].  See also [[Long line (telecommunications)]]

'''2.'''  In the military community, communications among users on a national or worldwide basis.

''Note 1:''  Compared to [[tactical communications]], long-haul communications are characterized by (a) higher levels of users, such as the [[National Command Authority]], (b) more stringent performance requirements, such as higher quality circuits, (c) longer distances between users, including worldwide distances, (d) higher [[traffic]] volumes and densities, (e) larger [[telephone exchange|switch]]es and [[trunking|trunk]] cross sections, and (f) fixed and recoverable assets.

''Note 2:''  ''&quot;Long-haul communications&quot;'' usually pertains to the U.S. Defense [[Communications System]].

'' Note 3:'' ''&quot;Long-haul telecommunications technicians&quot;'' can be translated into many fields of IT work within the corporate industry (Information Technology, Network Technician, Telecommunication Specialist, It Support, and so on). While the term is used in military most career fields that are in communications such as 3D1X2 - Cyber Transport Systems (the career field has been renamed so many times over the course of many years but essentially it is the same job (Network Infrastructure Tech., Systems Control Technician, and Cyber Transport Systems)) or may work in areas that require the &quot;in between&quot; (cloud networking) for networks (MSPP, ATM, Routers, Switches), phones (VOIP, DS0 - DS4 or higher, and so on), encryption (configuring encryption devices or monitoring), and video support data transfers. The &quot;bulk data transfer&quot; or aggregation networking.

The Long-haul telecommunication technicians is considered a &quot;jack of all&quot; but it is much in the technician's interest to gather greater education with certifications to qualify for certain jobs outside the military. The Military provides an avenue but does not make the individual a master of the career field. The technician will find that the job out look outside of military requires many things that aren't required of them within the career field while in the military. So it is best to find the job that is similar to the AFSC and also view the companies description of the qualification to fit that job. Also at least get an associate degree, over 5 years experience, and all of the required &quot;certs&quot; (Network +, Security +, CCNA, CCNP and so on) to acquire the job or at least an interview. The best time to apply or get a guaranteed job is the last three months before you leave the military. Military personnel that are within the career field 3D1X2 require a Secret, TS, or TS with SCI clearance in order to do the job.

      <text bytes="3838" xml:space="preserve">In telecommunication, a '''longitudinal redundancy check''' (LRC), or '''horizontal redundancy check''', is a form of [[redundancy check]] that is applied independently to each of a parallel group of bit streams.  The data must be divided into [[transmission block]]s, to which the additional check data is added.

The term usually applies to a single [[parity bit]] per bit stream, calculated independently of all the other bit streams ([[BIP-8]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;rfc935&quot;&gt;
{{IETF RFC|935}}: &quot;Reliable link layer protocols&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.slideshare.net/angelgdiaz_ut/errors-error-detection-and-error-control-8600677 &quot;Errors, Error Detection, and Error Control:  Data Communications and ComputerNetworks: A Business User's Approach&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; although it could also be used to refer to a larger [[Hamming code]].
{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

This &quot;extra&quot; LRC word at the end of a block of data is very similar to [[checksum]] and [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC).

== Optimal rectangular code ==
While simple longitudinal [[parity bit|parity]] can only [[error detection|detect]] errors, it can be combined with additional error-control coding, such as a [[transverse redundancy check]] (TRC), to [[error correction|correct]] errors. The transverse redundancy check is stored on a dedicated &quot;parity track&quot;.

Whenever any single-bit error occurs in a transmission block of data, such two-dimensional parity checking, or &quot;two-coordinate parity checking&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/~dcykcho/dco2310/Chapter7.htm ].
&lt;/ref&gt;
enables the receiver to use the TRC to detect which byte the error occurred in, and the LRC to detect exactly which track the error occurred in, to discover exactly which bit is in error, and then correct that bit by flipping it.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pseudocode ==

International standard '''ISO 1155'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=5723 ISO 1155:1978 ''Information processing -- Use of longitudinal parity to detect errors in information messages''].&lt;/ref&gt; states that a longitudinal redundancy check for a sequence of bytes may be computed in [[software]] by the following algorithm:

 ''lrc'' := 0
 '''for each''' byte ''b'' in the buffer '''do'''
     ''lrc'' := (''lrc'' + ''b'') '''and''' 0xFF
 ''lrc'' := (((''lrc'' XOR 0xFF) + 1) '''and''' 0xFF)

which can be expressed as &quot;the 8-bit two's-complement value of the sum of all bytes modulo 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; (&lt;code&gt;x AND 0xFF&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;x MOD 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

== Other Forms ==

Many protocols use an XOR-based longitudinal redundancy check byte (often called [[block check character]] or BCC), including the [[serial line internet protocol]] (SLIP),&lt;ref&gt;
{{IETF RFC|914}}.
&quot;A Thinwire Protocol for connecting personal computers to the INTERNET&quot;.
Appendix D: &quot;Serial Line Interface Protocol (SLIP)&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;
the [[IEC 62056]]-21 standard for electrical-meter reading, smart cards as defined in [[ISO/IEC 7816]], and the [[ACCESS.bus]] protocol.

An 8-bit LRC such as this is equivalent to a [[cyclic redundancy check]] using the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; + 1, but the independence of the bit streams is less clear when looked at in that way.

      <comment>Adding [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]]: &quot;Sum of the gain around a feedback loop&quot; ([[Wikipedia:Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text bytes="4111" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Sum of the gain around a feedback loop}}
In [[electronics]] and [[Control Systems Engineering|control system theory]], '''loop gain''' is the sum of the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], expressed as a ratio or in [[decibel]]s, around a [[feedback loop]].   Feedback loops are widely used in electronics in [[amplifier]]s and [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]], and more generally in both electronic and nonelectronic industrial [[control system]]s to control industrial plant and equipment.  The concept is also used in [[biology]].  In a feedback loop, the output of a device, process or plant is sampled and applied to alter the input, to better control the output.  The loop gain, along with the related concept of loop [[phase shift]], determines the behavior of the device, and particularly whether the output is [[BIBO stability|stable]], or unstable, which can result in [[oscillation]].  The importance of loop gain as a parameter for characterizing electronic feedback amplifiers was first recognized by [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] in 1921, and was developed further by [[Hendrik Wade Bode]] and [[Harry Nyquist]] at [[Bell Labs]] in the 1930s.

[[Image:Block Diagram for Feedback.svg|thumb|A block diagram of an electronic amplifier with feedback.]]
A [[block diagram]] of an electronic amplifier with [[negative feedback]] is shown at right.  The input signal is applied to the amplifier with [[open-loop gain]] ''A'' and amplified.  The output of the amplifier is applied to a feedback network with gain ''β'', and subtracted from the input to the amplifier.  The loop gain is calculated by imagining the feedback loop is broken at some point, and calculating the net gain if a signal is applied.  In the diagram shown, the loop gain is the product of the gains of the amplifier and the feedback network, ''−Aβ''.  The minus sign is because the feedback signal is subtracted from the input.  

The gains ''A'' and ''β'', and therefore the loop gain, generally vary with the [[frequency]] of the input signal, and so are usually expressed as functions of the [[angular frequency]] ''ω'' in [[radians per second]].  It is often displayed as a graph with the horizontal axis frequency ''ω'' and the vertical axis gain.     In amplifiers, the loop gain is the difference between the open-loop gain curve and the closed-loop gain curve (actually, the 1/β curve) on a dB scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://training.ti.com/system/files/docs/1332%20-%20Stability%202%20-%20slides.pdf|title = TI Precision Labs - Op-amps - Stability 2|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = |quote = To find the magnitude of AolB, we can simply subtract 1/B from Aol.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/tutorials/MT-033.pdf|title = MT-033 TUTORIAL Voltage Feedback Op Amp Gain and Bandwidth|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = |quote = The difference between the open-loop gain and the closed-loop gain is known as the loop gain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text bytes="9805" xml:space="preserve">'''LPD433''' (low power device 433&amp;nbsp;MHz) is a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] band in which license free communication devices are allowed to operate in some regions. The frequencies correspond with the [[International Telecommunication Union region|ITU region 1]] [[ISM band]] of 433.050&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]] to 434.790&amp;nbsp;MHz, and operation is limited to [[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations|CEPT]] countries. The frequencies used are within the [[70-centimeter band]], which is currently reserved for government and [[amateur radio]] operations in the United States and most nations worldwide.

LPD hand-held radios are authorized for licence-free voice communications use in most of Europe using analog [[frequency modulation]] (FM) as part of [[short range device]] regulations,&lt;ref name=rec_70-03&gt;[[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations|CEPT/ERC]] [http://www.erodocdb.dk/docs/doc98/official/pdf/rec7003e.pdf  REC 70-03] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805013647/http://www.erodocdb.dk/Docs/doc98/official/pdf/REC7003E.PDF |date=2013-08-05 }} (22 August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; with 25 [[kilohertz|kHz]] channel spacing, for a total of 69 channels.

LPD is also used in vehicle key-less entry device, garage or gate openers and some outdoor home weather station products.

==Usage by country==

'''ITU Region 1 (Europe)'''

'''United Kingdom'''

In the UK, LPD433 equipment that meets the respective [[Ofcom]] Interface Requirement can be used for model control, analogue/digitised voice and [[Remote keyless system|remote keyless entry systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0028/84970/ir-2030-july-2017.pdf

The frequencies from 430 to 440&amp;nbsp;MHz are allocated on a secondary basis to licensed radio amateurs who are allowed to use up to 40&amp;nbsp;W (16&amp;nbsp;dBW) between 430 and 432&amp;nbsp;MHz and 400&amp;nbsp;W (26&amp;nbsp;dBW) between 432 and 440&amp;nbsp;MHz. Channels 1 to 14 are UK amateur repeater outputs and channels 62 to 69 are UK amateur repeater inputs. This band is shared on a secondary basis for both licensed and licence exempt users, with the primary user being the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/spectrum/spectrum-information/UKFAT_2013.pdf|title=United Kingdom Frequency Allocation Table 2013 |publisher=Ofcom |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ofcom, together with the  [[Radio Society of Great Britain|RSGB]] Emerging Technology Co-ordination Committee have produced guidelines to help mitigate the side effects of interference to an extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/86172/Interference-between-Short-Range-Devices-and-Amateur-Repeaters.pdf|title=Interference between Short Range Devices and Amateur Repeaters|publisher=Ofcom |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ukrepeater.net/documents/srd.pdf|title=Paper on SRD Mitigation Techniques |publisher=R.S.G.B.

'''Switzerland'''

Switzerland permits the use of all 69 LPD433 channels with a maximum power output of 10mW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcomnet.ch/api/rir/1008/19|title=Technical interfaces regulations|publisher=OFCOM (Swiss Federal Office of Communications)|accessdate=2020-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ezv.admin.ch/dam/ezv/en/dokumente/archiv/2013/01/merkblatt_funk_inderschweiz.pdf.download.pdf/leaflet_radiocommunicationsinswitzerland.pdf|title=Radiocommunications in Switzerland|publisher=Bundesamt für Kommunikation|accessdate=2020-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Other European countries'''

European [[Remote keyless system|remote keyless entry systems]] often use the 433&amp;nbsp;MHz band, although, as in all of Europe, these frequencies are within the [[70-centimeter band]] allocated to [[amateur radio]], and interference results. In Germany, before the end of 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rc-network.de/magazin/artikel_05/art_05-027/laender/GER.pdf RC-Network.de Fernsteuerfrequenzen für den Modellbau - Deutschland  (Frequency bands for RC modeling - Germany) - &quot;Am 31.12.2008 endet die Betriebserlaubnis für Fernsteuerungen im Frequenzbereich 433 MHz!&quot;] (As of 12/31/2008, RC use of the 433 MHz bands ends in Germany!)&lt;/ref&gt; radio control enthusiasts were able to use frequencies from channel 03 through 67 on the above chart for radio control of any form of model (air or ground-based), all with odd channel numbers (03, 05, etc. up to ch. 67) as read on the chart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukrcc.org/germany.html |title=United Kingdom Radio Control Council: International Frequencies - Germany |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=UKRCC |publisher=UKRCC |accessdate=July 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with each sanctioned frequency having 50&amp;nbsp;kHz of bandwidth separation between each adjacent channel.

'''ITU Region 2 (America)'''

In [[International Telecommunication Union region|ITU region 2]] (the Americas), the frequencies that LPD433 uses are also within the [[70-centimeter band]] allocated to [[amateur radio]]. In the United States LPD433 radios can only be used under [[Title 47 CFR Part 97|FCC amateur regulations]] by [[Amateur radio licensing in the United States|properly licensed amateur radio operators]].

'''ITU Region 3'''

'''Malaysia'''

In [[telecommunication]], '''magneto-ionic double refraction''' is the combined effect of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] and atmospheric ionization, whereby a linearly polarized wave entering the [[ionosphere]] is split into two components called the ordinary wave and extraordinary wave.

The component waves follow different paths, experience different attenuations, have different [[phase velocity|phase velocities]], and, in general, are elliptically polarized in opposite senses. The [[critical frequency]] of the extraordinary wave is always greater than the [[critical frequency]] of the ordinary wave (i.e. the wave in absence of the magnetic field) by the amount approximately equal to .5 times of gyro frequency . The amplitude of  extraordinary wave is dependent on the earth magnetic field at that particular point . Beside splitting, the polarization of the incident radio wave is also effected by this phenomenon because the electron that were earlier in simple harmonic motion only are now in spiral motion too due to the magnetic field.

A '''magneto-optic effect''' is any one of a number of phenomena in which an [[electromagnetic wave]] propagates through a medium that has been altered by the presence of a quasistatic [[magnetic field]].   In such a medium, which is also called '''gyrotropic''' or '''gyromagnetic''', left- and right-rotating elliptical polarizations can propagate at different speeds, leading to a number of important phenomena.  When light is transmitted through a layer of magneto-optic material, the result is called the [[Faraday effect]]: the plane of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] can be rotated, forming a [[Faraday rotator]].  The results of reflection from a magneto-optic material are known as the [[magneto-optic Kerr effect]] (not to be confused with the [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear]] [[Kerr effect]]).

In general, magneto-optic effects break [[time reversal symmetry]]  locally (i.e. when only the propagation of light, and not the source of the magnetic field, is considered) as well as [[Lorentz reciprocity]], which is a necessary condition to construct devices such as [[Faraday isolator|optical isolator]]s (through which light passes in one direction but not the other).

Two gyrotropic materials with reversed rotation directions of the two principal polarizations, corresponding to complex-conjugate ε tensors for lossless media, are called [[optical isomer]]s.

==Gyrotropic permittivity==

In particular, in a magneto-optic material the presence of a  magnetic field (either externally applied or because the material itself is [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]]) can cause a change in the [[permittivity]] tensor ε of the material. The ε becomes anisotropic, a 3×3 matrix, with [[complex number|complex]] off-diagonal components,  depending of course on the frequency ω of incident light. If the absorption losses can be neglected, ε is a [[Hermitian matrix]]. The resulting  [[Optical axis|principal axes]] become complex as well, corresponding to elliptically-polarized light where left- and right-rotating polarizations can travel at different speeds (analogous to [[birefringence]]).

More specifically, for the case where absorption losses can be neglected, the most general form of Hermitian ε is:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \begin{pmatrix}
\varepsilon_{xx}' &amp; \varepsilon_{xy}' + i g_z &amp; \varepsilon_{xz}' - i g_y \\
\varepsilon_{xy}' - i g_z &amp; \varepsilon_{yy}' &amp; \varepsilon_{yz}' + i g_x \\
\varepsilon_{xz}' + i g_y &amp; \varepsilon_{yz}' - i g_x &amp; \varepsilon_{zz}' \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently the relationship between the [[Electric displacement field|displacement field]] '''D''' and the [[electric field]] '''E''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon \mathbf{E} = \varepsilon' \mathbf{E} + i \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon'&lt;/math&gt; is a real [[symmetric matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g} = (g_x,g_y,g_z)&lt;/math&gt; is a real [[pseudovector]] called the '''gyration vector''', whose magnitude is generally small compared to the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon'&lt;/math&gt;. The direction of '''g''' is called the '''axis of gyration''' of the material.  To first order, '''g''' is proportional to the applied [[magnetic field]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g} = \varepsilon_0 \chi^{(m)} \mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(m)} \!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magneto-optical susceptibility]] (a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] in isotropic media, but more generally a [[tensor]]).  If this susceptibility itself depends upon the electric field, one can obtain a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] effect of [[magneto-optical parametric generation]] (somewhat analogous to a [[Pockels effect]] whose strength is controlled by the applied magnetic field).

The simplest case to analyze is the one in which '''g''' is a principal axis (eigenvector) of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon'&lt;/math&gt;, and the other two eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon'&lt;/math&gt; are identical.  Then, if we let '''g''' lie in the ''z'' direction for simplicity, the ε tensor simplifies to the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \begin{pmatrix}
\varepsilon_1 &amp; + i g_z &amp; 0 \\
 - i g_z &amp; \varepsilon_1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varepsilon_2 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Most commonly, one considers light propagating in the ''z'' direction (parallel to '''g''').  In this case the solutions are elliptically polarized electromagnetic waves with [[phase velocity|phase velocities]] &lt;math&gt;1 / \sqrt{\mu(\varepsilon_1 \pm g_z)}&lt;/math&gt; (where μ is the [[magnetic permeability]]).  This difference in phase velocities leads to the Faraday effect.

For light propagating purely perpendicular to the axis of gyration, the properties are known as the [[Cotton-Mouton effect]] and used for a [[Circulator]].

===Kerr Rotation and Kerr Ellipticity===
Kerr Rotation and Kerr Ellipticity are changes in the polarization of incident light which comes in contact with a gyromagnetic material. Kerr Rotation is a rotation in the plane of polarization of transmitted light, and Kerr Ellipticity is the ratio of the major to minor axis of the ellipse traced out by [[Elliptical polarization|elliptically]] polarized light on the plane through which it propagates. Changes in the orientation of polarized incident light can be quantified using these two properties.

[[Image:Circular.Polarization.Circularly.Polarized.Light With.Components Right.Handed.svg|thumb|Circular Polarized Light]]
According to classical physics, the speed of light varies with the permittivity of a material:

&lt;math&gt;v_p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon \mu}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of light through the material, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the material permittivity, and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the material permeability.  Because the permittivity is anisotropic, polarized light of different orientations will travel at different speeds.

This can be better understood if we consider a wave of light that is circularly polarized (seen to the right). If this wave interacts with a material at which the horizontal component (green sinusoid) travels at a different speed than the vertical component (blue sinusoid), the two components will fall out of the 90 degree phase difference (required for circular polarization) changing the Kerr Ellipticity

A change in Kerr Rotation is most easily recognized in linearly polarized light, which can be separated into two [[Circular polarization|Circularly polarized]] components: Left-Handed Circular Polarized (LCP) light and Right-Handed Circular Polarized (RCP) light. The anisotropy of the Magneto Optic material permittivity causes a difference in the speed of LCP and RCP light, which will cause a change in the angle of polarized light. Materials that exhibit this property are known as [[Birefringence|Birefringent]].

From this rotation, we can calculate the difference in orthogonal velocity components, find the anisotropic permittivity, find the gyration vector, and calculate the applied magnetic field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia-Merino |first1=J.

[[File:&quot;Marine Cpl. Robert L. Hardin...checks the main distributing frame in Montford Point's headquarters for line difficultie - NARA - 532515.jpg|thumb|Small, single-sided MDF for a military base]]
[[File:Jarretiere telephonie.jpg|thumb|Modern main distribution frame]]
In [[telephony]], a '''main distribution frame''' ('''MDF''' or '''main frame''') is a signal [[distribution frame]] for connecting equipment ([[inside plant]]) to cables and [[pair gain|subscriber carrier]] equipment ([[outside plant]]). 

==Overview==
The MDF is a termination point within the local [[telephone exchange]] where exchange equipment and terminations of [[local loop]]s are connected by jumper wires at the MDF.  All cable copper pairs supplying services through [[User (telecommunications)|user]] [[telephone line]]s are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. [[repeater]]s and [[DSLAM]].  Cables to [[intermediate distribution frame]]s (IDF) terminate at the MDF.  [[trunk (telecommunications)|Trunk]] cables may terminate on the same MDF or on a separate trunk main distribution frame (TMDF).

Like other [[distribution frame]]s the MDF provides flexibility in assigning facilities, at lower cost and higher capacity than a [[patch panel]].

The most common kind of large MDF is a long steel rack accessible from both sides. On one side, [[Electrical wiring|termination]] blocks are arranged horizontally at the front of rack shelves.  Jumpers lie on the shelves and go through an insulated steel hoop to run vertically to other termination blocks that are arranged vertically.  There is a hoop or ring at the intersection of each level and each vertical.  Installing a jumper historically required two workers, one on either side of the MDF. The shelves are shallow enough to allow the rings to be within arm's reach, but the workers prefer to hang the jumper on a hook on a pole so their partner can pull it through the ring.  A fanning strip at the back of each termination block prevents the wires from covering each other's terminals.  With disciplined administration, the MDF can hold over a hundred thousand jumpers, with dozens changed every day, for decades without tangling.

The MDF usually holds [[telephone exchange]] protective devices including [[heat coil]]s, and functions as a [[test point]] between a line and the exchange equipment. 

== History ==
[[File:American telephone practice (1905) (14733380746).jpg|thumb|MDF newly installed in a large urban exchange, early 20th century, no jumpers yet]]
Before 1960, MDF jumpers were generally [[soldering|solder]]ed.  This was reliable but slow and expensive.  [[Wire wrap]] was introduced in the 1960s, and [[punch block]]s in the 1970s. In most exchanges in the UK, soldered blocks are still in use, but are being slowly phased out.

Each jumper is a [[twisted pair]].  Middle 20th century jumper wires in the USA were 24 [[American wire gauge|AWG]] single strand copper, with a soft [[polyethylene]] inner jacket and a cotton wrapper, impregnated to make it slightly brittle and easy to remove neatly.  Late 20th century ones had a single, thicker coating of [[Cross-linked polyethylene|polyethylene cross-linked]] to provide a suitable degree of brittleness.

Some urban telephone exchange MDFs are two stories high so they do not have to be more than a city block long.  A few are three stories. Access to the upper levels can be either by a traveling ladder attached to the MDF, or by mezzanine walkways at a suitable height. By British custom the cables to the outside world are terminated on the horizontal side, and the indoors equipment on the vertical side. American usage is the opposite.

Smaller MDFs, and some modern large ones, are single sided so one worker can install, remove or change a jumper.  [[COSMOS (Telecommunications)|COSMOS]] and other computerized [[Operations Support Systems]] help by assigning terminals close to one another, so most jumpers need not be long and shelves on either type of MDF do not become congested.  This database keeps track of all terminals and jumpers.  In the early and middle 20th century these records were kept as pencil entries in ledger books.  The later database method saves much labor by permitting old jumpers to be reused for new lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDF Jumpering|url=https://mrtelco.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of [[distributed switching]] in the late 20th century diminished the need for large, active, central MDFs.

Sometimes the MDF is combined with other kinds of [[distribution frame]] in a [[Combined distribution frame|CDF]].

The MDF in a [[private branch exchange]] performs functions similar to those performed by the MDF in a central office.

[[Automated Main Distribution Frame]] (AMDF) has been a subject of experiments.

In a [[antenna (electronics)|radio antenna's]] [[radiation pattern]], the '''main lobe''', or '''main beam,''' is the [[Side lobe|lobe]] containing the higher [[Power (physics)|power]]. This is the lobe that exhibits the greater [[field strength]].

The radiation pattern of most antennas shows a pattern of &quot;''lobes''&quot; at various angles, directions where the radiated signal strength reaches a maximum, separated by &quot;''[[null (radio)|null]]s''&quot;, angles at which the radiation falls to zero.  In a [[directional antenna]] in which the objective is to emit the radio waves in one direction, the lobe in that direction is designed to have higher field strength than the others, so on a graph of the radiation pattern it appears biggest; this is the main lobe.  The other lobes are called &quot;''[[sidelobe]]s''&quot;, and usually represent unwanted radiation in undesired directions.  The sidelobe in the opposite direction from the main lobe is called the &quot;''backlobe''&quot;. 

The radiation pattern referred to above is usually the horizontal radiation pattern, which is plotted as a function of [[azimuth]] about the antenna, although the vertical radiation pattern may also have a main lobe.   The [[beamwidth]] of the antenna is the width of the main lobe, usually specified by the ''[[half power beam width]]'' (HPBW),  the angle encompassed between the points on the side of the lobe where the power has fallen to half (-3 [[decibel|dB]]) of its maximum value.

The concepts of main lobe and sidelobes also apply to [[acoustics]] and [[optics]], and are used to describe the radiation pattern of optical systems like [[telescope]]s, and acoustic transducers like [[microphone]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s.

In [[engineering]], '''maintainability''' is the ease with which a product can be maintained in order to:
* correct defects or their cause,
* repair or replace faulty or worn-out components without having to replace still working parts,
* prevent unexpected working conditions,
* maximize a product's useful life,
* maximize efficiency, reliability, and safety,
* meet new [[requirements]],
* make future maintenance easier, or
* cope with a changed environment.

In some cases, maintainability involves a system of [[continuous improvement]] - learning from the past in order to improve the ability to maintain systems, or improve reliability of systems based on maintenance experience.

In [[telecommunication]] and several other engineering fields, the term '''maintainability''' has the following meanings:

* A characteristic of design and installation, expressed as the probability that an item will be retained in or restored to a specified condition within a given period of [[time]], when the [[repair and maintenance|maintenance]] is performed in accordance with prescribed procedures and resources.
* The ease with which maintenance of a [[functional unit]] can be performed in accordance with prescribed requirements.

== Software engineering ==
In [[software engineering]], these activities are known as [[software maintenance]] (cf. [[ISO/IEC 9126]]). Closely related concepts in the software engineering domain are evolvability, modifiability, [[Technical debt|technical debt]], and [[Code smell|code smells]].

The maintainability index is calculated with certain formulae from [[Lines of code|lines-of-code measures]], [[McCabe Measure|McCabe measures]] and [[Halstead complexity measures]].

The measurement and track of maintainability are intended to help reduce or reverse a system's tendency toward &quot;code entropy&quot; or degraded integrity, and to indicate when it becomes cheaper and/or less risky to rewrite the code than it is to change it.

      <text bytes="7613" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|A line code used in early magnetic data storage and Ethernet}}

In [[telecommunication]] and [[computer data storage|data storage]], '''Manchester code''' (also known as '''phase encoding''', or '''PE''') is a [[line code]] in which the encoding of each data [[bit]] is either low then high, or high then low, for equal time. It is a [[self-clocking signal]] with no [[DC component]]. Consequently, electrical connections using a Manchester code are easily [[galvanic isolation|galvanically isolated]].

Manchester code derives its name from its development at the [[University of Manchester]], where the coding was used for storing data on the magnetic drums of the [[Manchester Mark 1]] computer.

Manchester code was widely used for [[magnetic recording]] on 1600&amp;nbsp;bpi computer tapes before the introduction of 6250&amp;nbsp;bpi tapes which used the more efficient [[group-coded recording]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital Magnetic Tape Recording |author-first=John J. G. |author-last=Savard |date=2018 |orig-year=2006 |work=quadibloc |url=http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/tapeint.htm |access-date=2018-07-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702234956/http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/tapeint.htm |archive-date=2018-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester code was used in early [[Ethernet physical layer]] standards and is still used in [[consumer IR]] protocols, [[RFID]] and [[near-field communication]].

== Features ==
Manchester coding is a special case of [[binary phase-shift keying]] (BPSK), where the data controls the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a square wave [[Carrier signal|carrier]] whose frequency is the data rate. Manchester code ensures frequent line voltage transitions, directly proportional to the clock rate; this helps [[clock recovery]].

The [[DC component]] of the encoded signal is not dependent on the data and therefore carries no information. Therefore connections may be [[Inductive coupling|inductively]] or [[Capacitive coupling|capacitively]] coupled, allowing the signal to be conveyed conveniently by galvanically isolated media (e.g., Ethernet) using a [[network isolator]]—a simple one-to-one [[isolation transformer]] which cannot convey a DC component. 

According to [[Cisco]], &quot;Manchester encoding introduces some difficult frequency-related problems that make it unsuitable for use at higher data rates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Ethernet_Technologies |title=Ethernet Technologies |publisher=[[Cisco Systems]] |access-date=2017-09-12 |quote=Manchester encoding introduces some difficult frequency-related problems that make it unsuitable for use at higher data rates. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228005303/http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Ethernet_Technologies |archive-date=2018-12-28 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Difficulties are in meeting [[Title 47 CFR Part 15]] and other RF emissions requirements.--&gt;

There are more complex codes, such as [[8B/10B encoding]], that use less [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to achieve the same data rate but may be less tolerant of frequency errors and [[jitter]] in the transmitter and receiver reference clocks.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==Encoding and decoding== 
[[Image:Manchester encoding both conventions.svg|thumb|650px|An example of Manchester encoding showing both [[Manchester code#Conventions for representation of data|conventions for representation of data]]]]

Manchester code always has a transition at the middle of each bit period and may (depending on the information to be transmitted) have a transition at the start of the period also. The direction of the mid-bit transition indicates the data. Transitions at the period boundaries do not carry information.  They exist only to place the signal in the correct state to allow the mid-bit transition. 

===Conventions for representation of data===
There are two opposing conventions for the representations of data.

The first of these was first published by G. E. Thomas in 1949 and is followed by numerous authors (e.g., [[Andrew S. Tanenbaum|Andy Tanenbaum]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;tanenbaum&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Tanenbaum |author-first=Andrew S. |author-link=Andrew S. Tanenbaum |title=Computer Networks |edition=4th |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |date=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/computernetworks00tane_2/page/274 274–275] |isbn=0-13-066102-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/computernetworks00tane_2/page/274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It specifies that for a 0 bit the signal levels will be low-high (assuming an amplitude physical encoding of the data) - with a low level in the first half of the bit period, and a high level in the second half. For a 1 bit the signal levels will be high-low.  This is also known as Manchester II or Biphase-L code.

The second convention is also followed by numerous authors (e.g., [[William Stallings]])&lt;ref name=&quot;stallings&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Stallings |author-first=William |author-link=William Stallings |title=Data and Computer Communications |edition=7th |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |date=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/datacomputercomm00stal_1/page/137 137–138] |isbn=0-13-100681-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/datacomputercomm00stal_1/page/137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by [[IEEE 802.4]] (token bus) and lower speed versions of [[IEEE 802.3]] (Ethernet) standards. It states that a logic 0 is represented by a high-low signal sequence and a logic 1 is represented by a low-high signal sequence.

If a Manchester encoded signal is inverted in communication, it is transformed from one convention to the other. This ambiguity can be overcome by using [[differential Manchester encoding]].

===Decoding===
The existence of guaranteed transitions allows the signal to be self-clocking, and also allows the receiver to align correctly; the receiver can identify if it is misaligned by half a bit period, as there will no longer always be a transition during each bit period. The price of these benefits is a doubling of the bandwidth requirement compared to simpler [[non-return-to-zero|NRZ]] coding schemes.

Encoding conventions are as follows:

In multimode [[fiber optics]], '''mandrel wrapping''' is  a technique used to preferentially attenuate high-order mode power  of a propagating optical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]].   Consequently, if the fibre is propagating substantial energy in affected modes, the [[modal distribution]] will be changed.

A '''cylindrical rod wrap''' consists of a specified number turns of fiber on a [[mandrel]] of specified size, depending on the fibre characteristics and the desired modal distribution. It has application in optical [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] performance tests, to create a defined mode power distribution or to prevent multimode propagation in single mode fibre.  If the launch fibre is fully filled ahead of the mandrel wrap, the higher-order [[Transverse mode|mode]]s will be stripped off, leaving only lower-order modes. If the launch fibre is underfilled, for example as a consequence of being energized by a [[laser diode]] or [[ELED|edge-emitting LED]], there will be no effect on the mode power distribution or loss measurements.

In multimode fibre, mandrel wrapping is used to eliminate the effect of &quot;transient loss&quot;, the tendency of high order modes to experience higher loss than lower order modes.  Numerical addition (in decibels) of the measured loss of multiple fibre segments and/or components overestimates the loss of the concatenated set if each segment or component has been measured with a full mode power distribution.

In single mode optical fibre measurements, it is used to enforce true single mode propagation at wavelengths near or below the theoretical cutoff wavelength, at which substantial power can exist in a higher order mode group.  In this use, it is commonly termed a '''High Order Mode Filter''' (HOMF).

Ultimately, the effect of mandrel wrapping on optical measurements depends on the propagating mode power distribution.  An additional loss mechanism has no effect unless power is present in the affected modes.

==Principle of operation==

The effect of physically bending an optical fibre around a cylindrical form is to slightly modify the effective refractive index in the curved region, which locally reduces the effective mode volume of the fibre.  This causes optical power in the highest order modes to become unguided, or so weakly guided as to be released into an unbound state, absorbed by the fiber coating or completely ejected from the fibre.   The practical effect of mandrel wrapping is to attenuate optical power propagating in the highest order modes.  Lower order modes are unaffected, experiencing neither increased loss nor conversion  into other modes (mode mixing).

==Determination of appropriate mandrel wrap conditions==

The mandrel diameter and number of turns are chosen to eliminate certain modes in a reproducible way.  It is empirically observed that more than 5 full 360 degree wraps creates little additional loss, so 3 to 5 turns are commonly specified.  The mandrel diameter affects how far into the mode volume the modal unbinding occurs.  Experimentally, one plots the transmitted power from a wrapped fibre into which a uniform modal power distribution has been excited, as a function of mandrel diameter, maintaining a constant number of turns.  This reveals step-like reductions in transmitted power as the diameter decreases, where each step is the point at which the mandrel is beginning to affect the next-lower mode group. For best measurement reproducibility, one would select a diameter that is not near such a transition, although this may not be possible if measurements must be performed over a range of wavelengths.  Total mode volume in a fiber is a function of wavelength, so the mandrel diameter at which the mode group transitions occur will change with wavelength.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''maritime broadcast communications net''' is a [[communications net]] that is used for international distress calling, including international lifeboat, lifecraft, and survival-craft [[high frequency]] (HF); aeronautical emergency [[very high frequency]] (VHF); survival [[ultra high frequency]] (UHF); international calling and safety very high frequency (VHF); combined scene-of-search-and-rescue; and other similar and related purposes. 

''Note:''  Basic international distress calling is performed at either [[medium frequency]] (MF) or at [[high frequency]] (HF).

      <text bytes="1678" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]], a '''master station''' is a station that controls or coordinates the activities of other stations in the system.

Examples:
*In a [[data network]], the control station may designate a master station to ensure [[data transfer]] to one or more slave stations.&lt;ref name=FS1037C&gt;[[Federal Standard 1037C]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such a master station controls one or more [[data link]]s of the data [[communications network]] at any given instant. The assignment of master status to a given station is temporary and is controlled by the control station according to the procedures set forth in the operational [[Communications protocol|protocol]]. Master status is normally conferred upon a station so that it may transmit a [[message]], but a station need not have a [[message]] to send to be designated the master station.
* In navigation systems using precise [[time dissemination]], the master station is a station that has the [[clock]] that is used to synchronize the clocks of subordinate stations.&lt;ref name=FS1037C/&gt;
* In [[basic mode link control]], the master station is a data station that has accepted an invitation to ensure a [[data transfer]] to one or more slave stations.&lt;ref name=FS1037C/&gt;  At a given instant, there can be only one master station on a data link.

==Operation modes==
In data transmission, a master station can be set to not wait for a reply from a slave station after transmitting each message or [[transmission block]]. In this case the station is said to be in &quot;continuous operation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Standard 1037C, entry for &quot;Continuous operation&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="3051" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]]s, '''maximum-ratio combining''' ('''MRC''') is a method of [[diversity combining]] in which:
#the signals from each [[Communication channel|channel]] are added together,
#the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of each channel is made [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the rms [[signal level]] and inversely proportional to the mean square [[Noise (electronics)|noise level]] in that channel.
#different proportionality constants are used for each channel. 
It is also known as '''ratio-squared combining''' and '''predetection combining'''.  Maximum-ratio combining is the optimum combiner for independent [[additive white Gaussian noise]] channels.

MRC can restore a signal to its original shape. The technique was invented by American engineer [[Leonard R. Kahn]]&lt;ref name=&quot;MRC&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahn|first1=Leonard|title=Ratio Squarer|journal=Proc. IRE (Corresp.)|date=November 1954|volume=42|issue=11|page=1704|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274666}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1954.

MRC has also been found in the field of neuroscience, where it has been shown that neurons in the retina scale their dependence on two sources of input in proportion to the signal-to-noise ratio of the inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Homann|first=Jan|last2=Freed|first2=Michael A.|date=2016-12-30|title=A mammalian retinal ganglion cell implements a neuronal computation that maximizes the SNR of its postsynaptic currents|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=37|issue=6|language=en|pages=2814–16|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2814-16.2016|issn=0270-6474|pmid=28039376|pmc=5299566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example: Least Squares estimate in the case of Rx diversity ==

We consider an example of which the receiver is endowed with N antennas. In this case, the received vector &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;y=hs+\rho n \,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is noise vector &lt;math&gt;n-CN(0,I_{N \times N})&lt;/math&gt;. Following the ML detection criterion the detection procedure may be written as
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\tilde{s}=argmin_{s \in QPSK}|\hat{s}-s|^2,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the least square solution to the above model.
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\hat{s}=(h^*h)^{-1}h^*y.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
The least square solution in this case is also known as maximum-ratio-combining (MRC). In the case of N antennas the LS can be written as
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\hat{s}=\frac{h_0^*y_0+h_1^*y_1+...+h_{N-1}^*y_{N-1}}{|h_0|^2+|h_1|^2+...+|h_{N-1}|^2},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
which means that the signal from each antenna is rotated and weighted according to the phase and strength of the channel, such that the signals from all antennas are combined to yield the maximum ratio between signal and noise terms.

      <text bytes="3612" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Highest radio frequency that can be used for skywave radio transmission}}
In [[radio]] [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]]  '''maximum usable frequency''' ('''MUF''') is the highest radio [[frequency]] that can be used for transmission between two points via [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] from the [[ionosphere]] ([[skywave]] or &quot;skip&quot; propagation) at a specified [[time]], independent of transmitter power. This index is especially useful in regard to [[shortwave]] transmissions. 

In [[shortwave]] radio communication, a major mode of long distance propagation  is for the [[radio wave]]s to reflect off the [[ionization|ionized]] layers of the atmosphere and return diagonally back to Earth.  In this way radio waves can travel beyond the horizon, around the curve of the Earth.  However the [[refractive index]] of the ionosphere decreases with increasing frequency, so there is an upper limit to the frequency which can be used.   Above this frequency the radio waves are not reflected by the ionosphere but are transmitted through it into space. 

The ionization of the atmosphere varies with time of day and season as well as with solar conditions, so the upper frequency limit for skywave communication varies on an hourly basis.   MUF is a median frequency, defined as the highest frequency at which skywave communication is possible 50% of the days in a month, as opposed to the [[lowest usable high frequency]] (LUF) which is the frequency at which communication is possible 90% of the days, and the [[Frequency of optimum transmission]] (FOT).

Typically the MUF is a predicted number. Given the [[maximum observed frequency]] (MOF) for a mode on each day of the month at a given hour, the MUF is the highest frequency for which an ionospheric communications path is predicted on 50% of the days of the month. 

On a given day, communications may or may not succeed at the MUF. Commonly, the optimal operating frequency for a given path is estimated at 80 to 90% of the MUF. As a [[rule of thumb]] the MUF is approximately 3 times the [[critical frequency]].&lt;ref&gt;Practical antenna handbook, 5th edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-163958-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{MUF} = \frac{\text{critical frequency}}{\cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tutorvista.com/content/physics/physics-iv/communication-systems/sky-wave-propagation.php&lt;/ref&gt;

where the critical frequency is the highest frequency reflected for a signal propagating directly upward and Θ is the angle of incidence.&lt;ref name=Poole&gt;{{cite web|last=Poole|first=Ian|title=Lowest &amp; Maximum Usable Frequency, Critical Frequency|url=https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/antennas-propagation/ionospheric/maximum-lowest-critical-optimum-usable-working-frequency.php|publisher=Electronics Notes|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Optimum Working Frequency ==
Another important parameter used in skywave propagation is the optimum working frequency (OWF), which estimates the maximum frequency that must be used for a given critical frequency and incident angle. It is the frequency chosen to avoid the irregularities of the atmosphere.

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{OWF} = 0.85 \mathrm{MUF} = 0.85 f_\mathrm{c} /(cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Mechanically induced modulation''' is an optical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] [[modulation]] induced by mechanical means. 

An example of deleterious mechanically induced modulation is speckle [[noise]] created in a multimode fiber by an imperfect [[Fusion splicing|splice]] or imperfectly mated connectors. Mechanical disturbance of the fiber ahead of the joint will introduce changes in the modal structure, resulting in variations of [[joint]] loss. This is a subset of many mechanisms that can lead to modal noise in an optical system.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''medium-power talker''' is a hypothetical talker, within a [[log-normal distribution]] of talkers, whose volume lies at the [[Average|medium]] [[Power (physics)|power]] of all talkers determining the volume distribution at the point of interest.  

When the distribution follows a log-normal curve (values expressed in decibels), the mean and standard deviation can be used to compute the medium-power talker. The talker volume distribution follows a log-normal curve and the medium-power talker is uniquely determined by the average talker volume. The medium-power talker volume, ''V'', is given by ''V'' = ''V'' &lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.115σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''V'' &lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the average of the talker volume distribution in volume units (vu), and σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[variance]] of the distribution.

A message may be delivered by various means, including [[courier]], [[telegraphy]], [[carrier pigeon]] and [[Bus (computing)|electronic bus]].
A message can be the content of a [[broadcasting|broadcast]].  An [[interactive]]
exchange of messages forms a [[conversation]].

One example of a message is a '''communiqué''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|m|juː|n|ɪ|k|eɪ}}), which is a brief report or statement released by a public agency.

== Roles in human communication ==

In communication between humans, messages can be verbal or [[nonverbal]]:

* A verbal message is an exchange of information using words. Examples include face-to-face communication, telephone calls, voicemails, etc.
* A nonverbal message is communicated through actions or behaviors rather than words, e.g. by the use of [[body language]].

== In computer science ==

There are two main senses of the word &quot;message&quot; in [[computing]]:  messages between the human users of [[computer]] systems that are delivered by those computer systems, and [[Event (computing)|messages]] passed between programs or between components of a [[Single transferable vote|single]] program, for their own purposes.

* [[Instant messaging]] and [[e-mail|emails]] are examples of computer software designed for delivering human-readable messages in formatted or unformatted text, from one person to another.
* [[Message passing]] is a form of communication used in concurrent and [[parallel computing]], object-oriented programming, and  [[interprocess communication|channel communicate]] , where communication is made by sending messages to recipients. In a related use of this sense of a message, in [[object-oriented programming language]] such as main library [&quot;msg&quot; box][[Smalltalk]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], a ''message'' is sent to an [[Object (computer science)|object]], specifying a ''request'' for action.

=== Safety and privacy concerns ===
Because computers are automated, and they do not require human interaction to do something, there have been many safety and privacy concerns in many areas of the computer science industry regarding messages.  There have been many cases where instant messaging apps were found to be at risk for spyware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/011119/hyderabad-whatsapp-is-vulnerable-to-spyware-attacks.html|title=Hyderabad: WhatsApp is vulnerable to spyware attacks|last=Sunku|first=Durgaprasad|date=2019-11-01|website=Deccan Chronicle|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These concerns are not just limited to cellphones, laptops, desktops, or devices of the like.  Some of these concerns even point towards displays in car dashboards, where these device are as smart as smartphones, however can be prone to attacks and is known that auto manufacturers have little to no regulations to follow when putting these devices in car dashboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-displays-safety-insight-idUSKCN0PH0BO20150707|title=Car dashboards that act like smart phones raise safety issues|date=2015-07-07|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also has been found by research that car information displays on dashboards can be distracting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://13wham.com/news/local/research-shows-car-dashboard-technology-is-distracting-especially-to-older-drivers|title=Research shows car dashboard technology is distracting, especially to older drivers|last=Staff|first=Antoinette DelBel, WHAM|date=2019-07-25|website=WHAM|access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Changes do not appear in article 2002/05/10'''
I made substantial changes to the article for [[Earth]] and though they appear in the most recent diffs, they do not appear in the article.  It doesn't look like normal counter-editing (which would show in the diffs, right?).  I tried deleting my browser's history files, and there was still no effect.

:Known cache problems. Edit and resave the page to clear the old cached version, or wait until Jimbo clears all the old cached pages. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Saturday, May 11, 2002

'''+ or _'''&lt;br&gt;
The &amp;action=history for http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/adrenal+gland refers to a number of http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Adrenal_gland pages. Are these pages the same?

:Yes, those are the same. The &quot;+&quot; is just a URL-encoding for a space, which is canonically changed to &quot;_&quot; for the internal database. The first letter is always capitalized internally so that a link at the beginning of a sentence and in the middle will not go to different pages. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Saturday, May 11, 2002

'''Diff colors'''

Diff pages speak of green and yellow being the colors of respectively the changed text and the old text. This is useless to those who set their own text colours and not very nice to visually impaired people working on wikipedia. It would be handier if the main way to recognize which is which would be a text (such as: &quot;The new text:&quot; and &quot;The old text:&quot;). Of course, colours could still be used complementary, but they should not be the primary way of distinguishing the two atoms of a diff.--branko

: Currently, a - or + will appear next to a deleted or added line.  So the bug is not in diff but rather in the documentation.  Anyone want to fix it? --[[user:Damian Yerrick|Damian Yerrick]]

'''Zero disappearing from diffs'''

The numeral &quot;0&quot; doesn't show up in the text of a diff when it comes immediately after a bracketing delimiter (&quot;(&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;{&quot;).  See the history of [[unit interval]] for examples of each of these.  In the HTML source of the diff file, the &quot;0&quot; simply isn't there.  The problem doesn't happen with other numerals.  -- [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]] (2002/04/17)

:There's a fun &quot;feature&quot; in PHP whereby the string &quot;0&quot; is sometimes considered to be equal to the empty string &quot;&quot; because, as far as I can tell, a numerical comparison is being used. This sounds suspiciously like an instance of that problem; I'll look into it... [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Wednesday, April 17, 2002

Here's another bug that I suspect is related. A less than symbol (&quot;&amp;lt;&quot;) that's the beginning of an HTML tag will sometimes be displayed in the diff as &quot;&amp;amp;lt;&quot; instead of &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;. This again occurs after a bracketing delimiter. As for &amp;gt;, an analogous effect occurs ''before'' a bracketing delimiter. For an example of this, see the diff for my edit today of [[ring ideal]].  -- [[user:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]] again (2002/05/05)

PS: I did a little experimenting -- see the history of [[user:Toby Bartels/sandbox]] -- and found it amazingly difficult to reproduce the effect. I could reproduce it with &quot;0&quot; only when the &quot;0&quot; was in red, and couldn't manage to reproduce it with &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; and &quot;&amp;gt;&quot; at all under a general condition. Take a look, if this might help.

'''Diff crashes on [[Separation_axioms]]'''

The latest (08:29 today) diff on this page returns the result:

:'''Line 188''':

:'''Fatal error''':
:Maximum execution
:time of 30 seconds
:exceeded in '''/home/wiki-'''
:'''newest/work-'''
:'''http/difflib.php''' on
:line '''267'''

:&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;

This seems to be coming from the PHP script.
Other diffs from earlier histories of that page are OK.
&amp;mdash; [[user:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]], Wednesday, June 12, 2002

Update:
I've just made an edit to the article.
The diff for my new edit shows up fine, but the 08:29 diff still fails.
(The only difference is that it's now line '''258''' instead of line '''267'''.)

----

'''History of vote pages misses many edits'''

I suppose that the intended behaviour was not to mark in the history automatic votes, only hand edits.
Fair enough; only hand edits have useful commentary in the Summary.
Unfortunately, what actually happens is that the history records only the edits immediately ''before'' the hand edits.
If the hand edit is followed by an automatic vote, then it doesn't show up in the history; an automatic vote followed by a hand edit does.
Especially when the Summary of a hand edit explains why something was removed from a list, this is problematic.

'''Georg Joachim de Porris''', also known as '''Rheticus''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˈrɛtɪkəs/]]; 16 February 1514 – 4 December 1574), was a [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], [[cartographer]], navigational-instrument maker, medical practitioner, and teacher. He is perhaps best known for his [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] tables and as [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'s sole pupil.&lt;ref name=&quot;d3&quot;&gt;Danielson, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He facilitated the publication of his master's ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres'').

==Surname==
Rheticus was born at [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]] in the [[Archduchy of Austria]]. Both his parents, Georg Iserin and Thomasina de Porris, were of Italian heritage and possessed considerable wealth, his father being the town physician as well as a government official. He was educated by his father until the age of 14 when Georg (Iserin) abused the trust of many of his patients, stealing belongings and money from their homes. In 1528 he was convicted and executed for his crimes, and as a result his family was stripped of their [[surname]].&lt;ref&gt;Danielson, pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family adopted the mother's maiden name: de Porris. Later as a student at the [[University of Wittenberg]], Georg Joachim adopted the [[toponym]] Rheticus, a form of the [[Latin]] name for his home region, [[Raetia|Rhaetia]], a [[Roman province]] that had included parts of Austria, [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. In the matriculation list for the [[University of Leipzig]] his family name, de Porris, is translated into German as von Lauchen. The lunar crater [[Rhaeticus (crater)|''Rhaeticus'']] as well as asteroid [[15949 Rhaeticus]] were named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mapping and Naming the Moon: A History of Lunar Cartography and Nomenclature|first=Ewen A.|last=Whitaker|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=2003|isbn=9780521544146|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aV1i27jDYL8C&amp;pg=PA65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patrons==
After Georg Iserin's death, [[Achilles Gasser]] took over his medical practice, helping Rheticus to continue his studies and supporting him, eventually going so far as to furnish him with a letter of introduction to [[Philipp Melanchthon]], a [[Theology|theologian]] and educator who would become a major patron, having reorganized the whole educational system of the Lutheran Protestant parts of Germany, reforming and founding several new universities during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. This relationship in particular would soon serve him well as Melanchton possibly chose him specifically for the University of Wittenberg. Rheticus studied at Feldkirch, [[Zürich]] and Wittenberg where he received his M.A. in 1536, after which Melanchthon appointed Rheticus as professor of the lower mathematics, arithmetic and astronomy, at the Wittenberg University.

Two years later, Melanchthon arranged a two-year leave for Rheticus to study with noted astronomers. Leaving Wittenberg in October 1538, he first went to [[Nuremberg]] to visit the professor of mathematics at the Eigidien Oberschule, [[Johannes Schöner]]. In Nuremberg he also made the acquaintance of other mathematicians such as [[Georg Hartmann]] and Thomas Venatorius as well as the printer-publisher [[Johannes Petreius]]. During his journey, probably in Nuremberg, Rheticus heard of Copernicus and decided to seek him out. It is unknown whether he had access to Copernicus' [[Commentariolus]], an unsigned, unpublished outline of Copernicus' revolutionary [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]] that Copernicus distributed to friends and colleagues three decades before he published ''[[De revolutionibus]]'', prior to this or perhaps on consulting Schöner who is believed to have persuaded him. From Johannes Petreius Rheticus was given works by [[Regiomontanus]] and others, intended as presents for Copernicus. He went on to [[Peter Apian]] at the [[University of Ingolstadt]] and [[Joachim Camerarius]] at the [[University of Tübingen]], then to his hometown when Rheticus would present Gasser with an edition of Sacrobosco. From Feldkirch he set out on his journey to visit Copernicus in [[Frombork]].

==Copernicus==

In May 1539, Rheticus arrived in [[Frombork]] (Frauenburg), where he spent two years with Copernicus.&lt;ref name=&quot;d3&quot;/&gt; Despite the effort invested thus far, Copernicus had not finished a manuscript of his work, apparently choosing to not seek publication, presumably due to issues reconciling such findings with the historically held religious attitudes at the time. Eventually though, he would be swayed to allow Rheticus to author an abstract on his research despite being well aware of the criticism and controversy it could bring.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1986&quot;&gt;Hugonnard-Roche, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Only following its reception, widely considered the best introduction to Copernicus' work, would he then give Rheticus further permission to edit and publish his work in full.&lt;ref&gt;Swerdlow, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In this, Rheticus would prove integral in utilizing previously forged social connections as well as strategically cultivating new ones just to bring it to publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1986&quot;/&gt; It was thus only because of this fortuitous meeting that the heliocentric theory, a concept that would still not be accepted for decades to come, would ultimately be brought to light.

In September 1539, Rheticus went to [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk) to visit the mayor, who gave him financial assistance to publish his ''[[Narratio Prima]]'' (''First Report'')&lt;ref&gt;Translated in [[Edward Rosen]], ''Three Copernican Treatises: The [[Commentariolus]] of Copernicus; [[The Letter against Werner]]; The [[Narratio Prima]] of [[Rheticus]]''; Columbia University Press, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; of Copernicus' forthcoming treatise. [[Franz Rhode|Rhode]] in Danzig published Narratio Prima in 1540.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1986&quot;/&gt; Unexpectedly, it also contains a eulogy of Prussia. In it, the origins, flora, and fauna of the country are discussed as well as descriptions for several of its cities, regarding their commerce and history, demonstrating that his travels frequently served a twin purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;b1969&quot;&gt;Burmeister, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; While in Danzig, Rheticus interviewed [[Maritime pilot|maritime pilots]] to learn about their problems in [[navigation]]. Rheticus also visited Copernicus' friend [[Tiedemann Giese]], who was [[Bishop of Chełmno]] (Culm) and further encouraged him to publish the former's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;g2007&quot;&gt;Grafton, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  At some point, he would additionally become a patron.

In August 1541, Rheticus presented both a copy of ''Chorographia'' (containing a systematic approach to the preparation of maps, distinguishing chorography from geography, discussing various methods of cartographic survey by the use of the compass as well as improvements to the aforementioned instrument) and ''Tabula chorographica auff Preussen und etliche umbliegende lender'' (''Map of Prussia and Neighboring Lands'') to [[Albert, Duke of Prussia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b1969&quot;/&gt; Knowing the duke had been trying to compute the exact time of sunrise, Rheticus made an instrument that determined the length of the day, and through this favor obtained from him a recommendation to Wittenberg that ''De revolutionibus'' be published. Albrecht asked Rheticus to end his travels and return to his teaching position. Rheticus returned to the University of Wittenberg in October 1541, then elected dean of the Faculty of Arts as well as joining the theological faculty. In May 1542, he traveled to Nürnberg to supervise the printing by Johannes Petreius of the first edition of ''De revolutionibus'' in which he included tables of trigonometric functions he had calculated in further support of Copernicus' work, but had to leave in fall to take a position at the University of Leipzig, and [[Andreas Osiander]] replaced him. A theologian, Osiander would use this role to add an unauthorized preface in a would-be attempt to avoid censorship, explicitly describing the theory discussed therein as a model of pure hypothesis predicated on assumptions that are coincidentally consistent with the calculations.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1984&quot;&gt;Hooykas, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Towards this, Rheticus would allegedly deface every such copy he came across.&lt;ref name=&quot;g2007&quot;/&gt; Copernicus' major work would eventually be published shortly before his death in 1543.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Owen Gingerich | author2=James H. MacLachlan  | date=2005 | title=Nicolaus Copernicus: making the Earth a planet | work=Oxford portraits in science | publisher=[[Oxford University Press US]] | isbn=0195161734 }}, pp 101-102&lt;/ref&gt;

In a work now properly attributed to Rheticus tentatively titled ''Epistolae de Terrae Motu'' (Letter on the Motion of the Earth), he attempts to reconcile Copernicanism with scripture by employing [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s principle of [[Accommodation (religion)|accommodation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;west&quot;&gt;Westman, 2011, pp.129-131&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Robert Westman, the ''Epistolae'' or also known as the ''Opusculum'', published posthumously and anonymously in 1651,&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Swerdlow]], ''Book-Review - Rheticus's Treatise on Holy Scripture and the Motion of the Earth,'' Hooykaas, R.,  Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol.17, no. 49/May pp 133-136, 1986 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1986JHA....17..133H]. [[Reijer Hooykaas]] found the small treatise (64 pages), identified it, and published it in 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates that Copernicus and Rheticus recognized the problem of conflict between their finding of earthly motion and biblical scripture, and had therefore developed a systematic defense of compatibility.&lt;ref name=west /&gt; Written in a moderate tone, he would suggest that the bible only contains that which is necessary for salvation, in doctrine and ethical instruction. Considering this tenet, scripture would then lack reference to any specific matter that may be studied by science, such as the movement of the earth with respect to the sun, with the exception being those facts of nature outside mankind's ability to investigate.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1984&quot;/&gt; Rheticus would further argue that biblical language was written in terms meant to be readily comprehensible to a wide audience:

{{quote|It borrows a kind of discourse, a habit of speech, and a method of teaching from popular usage.|&lt;small&gt;Rheticus describing scripture's apparent conflict with planetary motion in his ''Epistolae de Terrae Motu'' (posthumous).&lt;ref name=west /&gt;&lt;/small&gt;}}

While relying heavily upon citations to appease religious authorities, Rheticus may have nevertheless refrained from publishing the work in his life in order to avoid angering more conservative Christians such as [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]].

==Criminal history==
In 1542, Rheticus on the recommendation of Joachim Camerarius in conjunction with Melanchthon was then appointed professor of higher mathematics at Leipzig. Rheticus ended up taking another leave of absence in 1545, departing for Italy although the specifics of his itinerary remain unknown. In 1546-7, he would suffer from some unspecified severe mental disorder in Lindau, but recovered enough to return to teaching at Constance towards the latter. By 1551, he would publish some of his work in mathematics, trigonometric tables containing all six functions defined directly in terms of right triangles instead of circles, the first of its kind. While serving in this position, he simultaneously pursued other scholarly interests such as releasing a calendar and [[ephemeris]] in 1552 as well as the subsequent year. Then in 1552, Rheticus was found guilty of raping the son of Hans Meusel, a merchant, though the exact nature of this encounter has been called into question. According to Meusel, Rheticus &quot;plied him with a strong drink, until he was inebriated; and finally did with violence overcome him and practice upon him the shameful and cruel vice of sodomy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Repcheck |first=Jack |year=2008 |title=Copernicus's Secret: How the Scientific Revolution Began |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=0743289528 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He fled following this accusation, for a time residing in Chemnitz before eventually moving on to Prague.&lt;ref name=&quot;g2007&quot;/&gt; Rheticus was then found guilty in his [[trial in absentia]] and consequently exiled from Leipzig for 101 years as well as having his possessions impounded. As a result, he would come to lose the support of many long-time benefactors including Melanchthon.

==Later years==
Often overshadowed by the facilitative role he played in Copernicus' publications, Rheticus would continue to pursue other scientific endeavors following his exile. 1551-52 found him studying medicine at the University of Prague, primarily applying his skills toward treatment of patients without any appreciable contributions to the field. Then in 1553, he was offered a position in mathematics at Vienna where he would travel to ultimately decline the appointment, instead relocating to Kraków in 1554 for the next 20 years as a practicing doctor. While there, he continued his work within mathematics and astronomy, further compiling his calculations of trigonomic functions with funding from [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian II]] with the aid of numerous assistants. The canon of [[Warmia]] [[Georg Rafael Donner|Georg Donner]] and the [[bishop of Warmia]] [[Johannes Dantiscus]] were both patrons of Rheticus. Rheticus was also commissioned to make a staff for king Sigismund II of Poland, while he held a position as teacher in [[Kraków]] for many years. From there he went to [[Košice]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], where he died.

==Trigonometry==
For much of his life, Rheticus displayed a passion for the study of triangles, the branch of mathematics now called [[trigonometry]]. In 1542 he had the trigonometric sections of Copernicus' ''De revolutionibis'' published separately under the title ''De lateribus et angulis triangulorum'' (''On the Sides and Angles of Triangles''). In 1551 Rheticus produced a tract titled ''Canon of the Science of Triangles,'' the first publication of six-function trigonometric tables (although the word ''trigonometry'' was not yet coined).&lt;ref name=&quot;g2007&quot;/&gt; This pamphlet was to be an introduction to Rheticus' greatest work, a full set of tables to be used in angular astronomical measurements.&lt;ref&gt;Danielson, pp. 140–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

At his death, the ''Science of Triangles'' was still unfinished. However, paralleling his own relationship with Copernicus, Rheticus had acquired a student from Wittenberg who sought him out.&lt;ref name=&quot;g2007&quot;/&gt; [[Valentinus Otho]], devoted to completing his teacher's work, oversaw the hand computation of approximately 100,000 ratios to at least ten decimal places. When completed in 1596, the volume, ''Opus palatinum de triangulis,'' filled nearly 1,500 pages.

==In popular culture==

Rheticus narrates the third part of [[John Banville]]'s 1975 novel ''Doctor Copernicus'', relating how he convinced Copernicus to publish the book. The novel itself is less about Copernicus's work than about his life and the 16th century world in which he lived.

The episode [[Claudia (Warehouse 13)|&quot;Claudia&quot;]] of the U.S. science fiction series ''[[Warehouse 13]]'' references a teleportation device in the form of a compass said to have been built by Rheticus.

Rheticus is referenced several times in the song &quot;Like Rheticus&quot; on the 2004 album ''Place'' by British songwriter [[Owen Tromans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/place-mw0001895662 allmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dava Sobel]]'s 2011 book, ''[[A More Perfect Heaven: How Copernicus Revolutionized the Cosmos]]'', features a fictional play about Rheticus' visit to Copernicus, sandwiched between chapters about the visit's pre-history and post-history.

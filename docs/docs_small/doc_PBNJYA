==In an unbounded dielectric==

In an [[isotropic]], [[homogeneous]] [[dielectric]] with negligible magnetic properties, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} &lt;/math&gt; H/m and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \varepsilon_r \times 8.854\times 10^{-12}&lt;/math&gt; F/m. So, the value of wave impedance in a perfect dielectric is

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \sqrt {\mu \over \varepsilon} = \sqrt {\mu_0 \over \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r} = {Z_0 \over \sqrt \varepsilon_r} \approx {377 \over \sqrt {\varepsilon_r} }\,\Omega&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; is the relative [[dielectric constant]].

==In a waveguide==

For any [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] in the form of a hollow metal tube, (such as rectangular guide, circular guide, or double-ridge guide), the wave impedance of a travelling wave is dependent on the frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, but is the same throughout the guide. For transverse electric ([[Transverse mode|TE]]) modes of propagation the wave impedance is:&lt;ref name=&quot;Microwave Engineering&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pozar |first=David M. |title=Microwave engineering|date=2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-63155-3|edition=4th |location=Hoboken, NJ|oclc=714728044|pp=100-101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{Z_{0}}{\sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{f_{c}}{f}\right)^{2}}} \qquad \mbox{(TE modes)},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is the cut-off frequency of the mode, and for transverse magnetic ([[Transverse mode|TM]]) modes of propagation the wave impedance is:&lt;ref name=&quot;Microwave Engineering&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_{0} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{f_{c}}{f}\right)^{2}} \qquad \mbox{(TM modes)}&lt;/math&gt;

Above the cut-off ({{nowrap|''f'' &gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;}}), the impedance is real (resistive) and the wave carries energy. Below cut-off the impedance is imaginary (reactive) and the wave is [[evanescent wave|evanescent]]. These expressions neglect the effect of resistive loss in the walls of the waveguide. For a waveguide entirely filled with a homogeneous dielectric medium, similar expressions apply, but with the wave impedance of the medium replacing ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The presence of the dielectric also modifies the cut-off frequency ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;.

For a waveguide or transmission line containing more than one type of dielectric medium (such as [[microstrip]]), the wave impedance will in general vary over the cross-section of the line.

      <text bytes="901" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]], the term '''white facsimile transmission''' has the following meanings: 

# In an [[amplitude modulation|amplitude-modulated]] [[Fax|facsimile]] system, [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] in which the maximum transmitted [[power (physics)|power]] corresponds to the minimum density, ''i.e.'', the white area, of the object.
# In a [[frequency-modulated]] facsimile system, transmission in which the lowest transmitted frequency corresponds to the minimum density ''i.e.'', the white area, of the object.

Both of these terms became outmoded in the late 20th century except in specialist usage, as most fax machines now use the digital [[ITU-T]] fax standards, which encode the image [[Digital data|digital]]ly over a [[QAM-modulated]] signal.  See also [[Black facsimile transmission]].

      <text bytes="12739" xml:space="preserve">'''Wide Area Telephone Service''' (WATS) was a flat-rate [[long distance calling|long distance]] service offering for customer dial-type telecommunications in some of the countries that adhere to the [[North American Numbering Plan]].  The service was between a given customer phone (also known as a &quot;station&quot;) and stations within specified geographic rate areas, employing a single [[telephone line]] between the customer location and the serving [[telephone exchange|central office]]. Each access line could be arranged for outward (OUT-WATS) or inward (IN-WATS) service, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WATS was introduced by the [[Bell System]] in 1961 as a primitive long-distance flat-rate plan by which a business could obtain a special line with an included number of hours ('measured time' or 'full-time') of long-distance calling to a specified area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/howamericagotonl0000ston |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/howamericagotonl0000ston/page/70 70] |title=How America Got On-line: Politics, Markets, and the Revolution in Telecommunications |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |date=Jan 1, 1997 |author=Alan Stone |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lines were most often connected to [[private branch exchange]]s in large businesses. WATS lines were the basis for the first direct-dial toll-free +1-800 numbers (intrastate in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); advertisement.--&gt; |title=What's InWATS? |type=advertisement |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/traverse-city-record-eagle-apr-13-1966-p-28 |work=[[Traverse City Record-Eagle]] |location=[[Traverse City, Michigan]] |date=April 13, 1966 |access-date= |page=28 |quote=What's INWATS? An easier way for out-of-town customers to place their business with you! INWATS stands for Inward Wide Area Telephone Service. It lets selected customers call your company Long Distance with no cost to them. INWATS provides you with incoming telephone service from areas which you have selected. It automatically reverses the Long Distance charges so that you, instead of your customer, pay the toll. New, advanced telephone switching equipment makes sure only calls from these preselected areas are accepted toll-free. This service will increase the incentive of your present customers to do more business with you, and will help attract new customers, too. For details about how INWATS can serve you, call the Michigan Bell Business Office and ask for a Communications Consultant. Michigan Bell - Part of the Nationwide Bell System}}&lt;/ref&gt; interstate in 1967); by 1976, WATS brought [[AT&amp;T_Corporation#Origins|AT&amp;T Corporation]] a billion dollars in annual revenue.

For outbound calls, the 1984 [[AT&amp;T divestiture]] brought multiple competitors offering similar services using standard business telephone lines; the special WATS line was ultimately supplanted by other flat-rate offerings. The requirement that an inbound toll-free number terminate at a special WATS line or fixed-rate service was also rendered obsolete by the 1980s due to [[intelligent network]] capability and technological improvement in the +1{{nbh}}800 service. A toll-free number may now terminate at a [[T-carrier]] line, at any standard local telephone number or at one of multiple destinations based on time of day, call origin, cost or other factors.

==Outbound WATS==
For Outbound WATS, the United States was divided into geographical Bands 0 through 5. Band zero was intrastate calling and bands 1 through 5 (or 6) were interstate calls that were progressively further from the originating number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=WATS was built for Philip Carey (and you too) |type=advertisement |author=Cincinnati Bell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FesCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |pages=63â€“64 |magazine=Cincinnati Magazine |date=April 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the higher band number carried a higher price per month or per minute. These lines could be used for outbound long-distance only; not local. In the U.S., interstate WATS lines could not be used for intrastate calls, and vice versa. With wider availability of inexpensive long distance using regular business lines, OutWATS service became obsolete late in the 20th century.

==InWATS==
{{main|Toll-free telephone number}}
The original North American toll-free number was the [[Zenith number]], published in one distant city (or a few cities) only. Published as &quot;Zenith&quot; and a five-digit number, these [[collect call]]s required operator assistance. The called party was charged for the operator-assisted call.

With &quot;inward WATS&quot;, introduced for interstate calls by [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] in 1967, subscribers were issued a [[toll-free telephone number]] in a designated toll-free [[area code]]. Unlike a standard collect call or a call to a [[Zenith number]], +1{{nbh}}800- normally may be dialed directly with no live operator. Callers within a designated area could call without incurring a toll charge as the recipient paid for the calls at a fixed rate.

The introduction of InWATS fortuitously fell around the same time as the early centralized, automated national airline and hotel reservation systems, including [[Sabre Corporation|Sabre]] (American Airlines, 1963), [[Holiday Inn|Holidex]] (Holiday Inn, 1965) and [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Reservatron]] (Sheraton, 1969). Hundreds of local reservation numbers for a major chain could be replaced with one central number, backed by a national computerized reservation system.&lt;ref name=s8003253535&gt;http://www.bluemaumau.org/hotel_history_magic_8003253535&lt;/ref&gt;

InWATS exchanges were assigned to Canada and other North American Numbering Plan countries, but the original InWATS in each country accepted domestic calls only. Initially +1{{nbh}}800{{nbh}}NN2{{nbh}}XXXX numbers were U.S. intrastate and specific prefixes (such as +1{{nbh}}800{{nbh}}387 Toronto and +1{{nbh}}800{{nbh}}267 Ottawa) were assigned to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=1PVZHtB6XAwC&amp;pg=PT146 &quot;800 Number Allocation&quot;], Telecom Informer (February, 1987), Dan Foley, [[2600 Magazine]] reprinted in &quot;The Best of 2600: A Hacker Odyssey - By Emmanuel Goldstein&quot; suggests 1-800-NN7 as Canada, but AT&amp;T routing guides list 1-800-N61, 1-800-N63, 1-800-N65, 1-800-N67 as the most common Canadian toll-free exchange prefixes. There were exceptions to these patterns, but one prefix always identified one specific geographic destination area code in InWATS.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, AT&amp;T's internal routing guides included separate U.S. and Canadian 1-800 exchange maps which looked much like area code maps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofphonephreaking.org/docs/trg/TRG-1977-Sec02-03.pdf Traffic Routing Guide], AT&amp;T, 1977 matches each area code to one or more specific hard-wired exchanges.&lt;/ref&gt; as each geographic area code had one or more specific freephone exchange prefixes. [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]]'s 800{{nbh}}325{{nbh}}3535, one of the notable early adopters in late 1969, was hard-wired into [[St. Louis]] [[area code 314]];&lt;ref name=&quot;s8003253535&quot;/&gt; 1{{nbh}}800{{nbh}}HOLIDAY at that time could not be a U.S. number if the 1{{nbh}}800{{nbh}}465 prefix was hard-wired to [[Thunder Bay]]'s [[area code 807]]. Any attempt to call a foreign +1{{nbh}}800 gave a pre-recorded error, &quot;the number you have dialed is not available from your calling area.&quot;

Like the OutWATS service, AT&amp;T's InWATS was divided into intrastate and interstate, with interstate calls priced into five or six &quot;bands&quot; of calling. This favored placement of US national call centers in low-population Midwestern states such as [[Nebraska]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlantatelephonehistory.info/part4.html&lt;/ref&gt; whose central location meant a carefully situated &quot;band 3&quot; number reaching halfway across the US in every direction could potentially reach 47 states. A [[San Diego]] call center would be less fortunate; even with &quot;band 6&quot; (the most expensive lines), its 'national' number would be unreachable to millions as [[California]] is a populous state and intrastate calls needed a separate toll-free number.

The original InWATS system was supplanted by &quot;Advanced 800 Service&quot; in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Roy P | last=Weber | url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT4191860 | title=Data base communication call processing method (US Patent 4191860) | accessdate= | quote=Filed Jul 13, 1978. Issued Mar 4, 1980}}, devised at Bell Labs and deployed by AT&amp;T in 1982, supplanted InWATS with a flexible intelligent network database which could send any toll-free number anywhere.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern systems eliminated requirements tying toll-free numbers to dedicated flat-rate inbound WATS lines. [[Direct inward dial]], introduced in 1983, allowed one trunk to carry calls for multiple numbers. AT&amp;T's monopoly on U.S. toll-free number routing ended in 1986, encouraging flexibility in order to match rivals [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[MCI Communications|MCI]]. By 1989, fixed &quot;bands&quot; of coverage area had been largely replaced by distance-based billing, a growing number of 1{{nbh}}800 numbers were being terminated at standard local business or residence lines and one number could be sent to multiple locations based on call origin, least-cost routing or time of day routing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA25 |title=800 services now a fact of life |publisher=Network World |date=July 3, 1989 |accessdate=October 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RespOrg]]s were established in the U.S. in 1993 and Canada in 1994 to provide toll free number portability using the Service Management System ([[SMS/800]]) database.  Calls from Canada and the U.S., intrastate and interstate, could terminate at the same 1{{nbh}}800 number, even via different carriers. [[Vanity number]]s became easier to obtain as a toll-free exchange prefix was no longer tied to a geographic location. By the 21st century, [[Voice over IP]] placed toll-free and foreign exchange numbers into the hands of even the smallest users, to whom dedicated inbound lines under the original InWATS model would have been prohibitively expensive.

==WATS and the Civil Rights Movement==
During the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the U.S., activist organizations such as [[SNCC]] used WATS as a convenient way for eyewitnesses on the ground to convey information quickly. Notes from these phone calls were compiled into &quot;WATS Line Reports&quot; and mailed to civil rights leaders, the media, the Justice Department, and others involved in the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stephen|first1=Bijan|title=How Black Lives Matter Uses Social Media to Fight the Power|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/how-black-lives-matter-uses-social-media-to-fight-the-power/|accessdate=22 October 2015|work=Wired|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; WATS was also how organizations communicated with local leaders across the country. A &quot;Bay Area Friends of SNCC&quot; newsletter in 1965 described WATS:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The WATS (Wide Area Telephone Service) line is the heart of all SNCC security and communications. For a flat monthly rate, an unlimited number of calls can be dialed directly to any place in the country â€” or the state â€” depending on what line one uses. The Jackson office has a state-wide line, the Atlanta office has the national WATS line. Both run on a 24-hour basis. A project worker can call in news of any incident, threat or major activity to the Jackson office. The WATS operator there takes down the details and relays it to Atlanta if the event is of national importance. In the case of a threat or incident involving Federal laws, Jackson will notify the FBI and the Justice Department. Atlanta uses its national WATS line to notify SNCC groups around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WATS Reports|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt0199n3r6;NAAN=13030&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=d0e193&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e193&amp;brand=oac4|accessdate=22 October 2015|work=Bay Area Friends of SNCC Newsletter|publisher=Online Archive of California|date=February 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{selfref|For wildcard characters within the Wikipedia search engine, see [[Help:Wildcard]].}}

{{one source|date=May 2016}}
In [[software]], a '''wildcard character''' is a kind of '''placeholder''' represented by a single [[character (computing)|character]], such as an [[asterisk]] ({{code|*}}), which can be interpreted as a number of literal characters or an [[empty string]]. It is often used in file searches so the full name need not be typed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/find_c_search_wildcard.mspx?mfr=true|title=Microsoft Corporation|website=www.microsoft.com|access-date=2018-01-23|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324204434/http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/find_c_search_wildcard.mspx?mfr=true|archivedate=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telecommunication==
In [[telecommunication]]s, a wildcard is a character that may be substituted for any of a defined subset of all possible characters.

* In [[high-frequency]] (HF) [[radio]] [[automatic link establishment]], the wildcard character {{code|?}} may be substituted for any one of the 36 upper-case [[alphanumeric]] characters.
* Whether the wildcard character represents a single character or a [[String (computer science)|string]] of characters must be specified.

==Computing==
In [[computer]] ([[software]]) technology, a wildcard is a symbol used to replace or represent one or more characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/wildcard.htm|title=What is wildcard?|access-date=2016-11-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121171416/http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/wildcard.htm|archivedate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithms for matching wildcards have been developed in a number of [[recursion|recursive]] and non-recursive varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Cantatore| first=Alessandro| title=Wildcard matching algorithms| year=2003| url=http://xoomer.virgilio.it/acantato/dev/wildcard/wildmatch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===File and directory patterns===
When specifying file names (or paths) in [[CP/M]], [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, the [[asterisk]] character ({{code|*}}, also called &quot;star&quot;) matches zero or more characters. For example, {{code|doc*}} matches {{code|doc}} and {{code|document}} but not {{code|dodo}}.

In Unix-like and DOS operating systems, the [[question mark]] {{code|?}} matches exactly one character. In DOS, if the question mark is placed at the end of the word, it will also match missing (zero) trailing characters; for example, the pattern {{code|123?}} will match {{code|123}} and {{code|1234}}, but not {{code|12345}}.

In [[Unix shell]]s and [[Windows PowerShell]], ranges of characters enclosed in [[square brackets]] ({{code|[}} and {{code|]}}) match a single character within the set; for example, {{code|[A-Za-z]}} matches any single uppercase or lowercase letter. In Unix shells, a leading exclamation mark {{code|!}} negates the set and matches only a character not within the list. In shells that interpret {{code|!}} as a history substitution, a leading caret {{code|^}} can be used instead.

The operation of matching of wildcard patterns to multiple file or path names is referred to as [[glob (programming)|''globbing'']].

===Databases===
In [[SQL]], wildcard characters can be used in [[Like (SQL)|LIKE]] expressions; the [[percent]] sign {{code|%}} matches zero or more characters, and [[underscore]] {{code|_}} a single character. [[Transact-SQL]] also supports [[square brackets]] ({{code|[}} and {{code|]}}) to list sets and ranges of characters to match, a leading caret {{code|^}} negates the set and matches only a character not within the list. In [[Microsoft Access]], the [[asterisk]] sign {{code|*}} matches zero or more characters, the [[question mark]] {{code|?}} matches a single character, the [[number sign]] {{code|#}} matches a single digit ({{code|0-9}}), and square brackets can be used for sets or ranges of characters to match.

===Regular expressions===
In [[regular expression]]s, the [[Full stop|period]] ({{code|.}}, also called &quot;dot&quot;) is the wildcard pattern which matches any single character. Combined with the [[asterisk]] operator {{code|.*}} it will match any number of any characters.

In this case, the asterisk is also known as the [[Kleene star]].

      <text bytes="3092" xml:space="preserve">'''Network architecture''' is the design of a [[computer network]]. It is a framework for the specification of a network's physical components and their functional organization and configuration, its operational principles and procedures, as well as [[communication protocol]]s used. 

In [[telecommunication]], the specification of a network architecture may also include a detailed description of products and services delivered via a communications network, as well as detailed rate and billing structures under which services are compensated.

The network architecture of the [[Internet]] is predominantly expressed by its use of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], rather than a specific model for interconnecting networks or nodes in the network, or the usage of specific types of hardware links.

== OSI model ==
{{OSI model}}

The [[OSI model|Open Systems Interconnection model]] (OSI model) defines and codifies the concept of layered network architecture. [[Abstraction layer]]s are used to subdivide a communications system further into smaller manageable parts. A layer is a collection of similar functions that provide services to the layer above it and receives services from the layer below it. On each layer, an instance provides services to the instances at the layer above and requests service from the layer below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/OSI|title=What is OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchNetworking|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distributed computing ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}

In distinct usage in [[distributed computing]], the ''network architecture'' often describes the structure and classification of a distributed application architecture, as the participating nodes in a distributed application are often referred to as a ''network''. For example, the [[applications architecture]] of the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) has been termed the [[Intelligent Network]]. There are any number of specific classifications but all lie on a continuum between the [[dumb network]] (e.g. [[Internet]]) and the intelligent network (e.g. the telephone network).

A popular example of such usage of the term in distributed applications, as well as PVCs (permanent virtual circuits), is the organization of nodes in [[P2P network|peer-to-peer (P2P) services and networks]]. P2P networks usually implement [[overlay network]]s running over an underlying physical or logical network. These overlay networks may implement certain organizational structures of the nodes according to several distinct models, the network architecture of the system.

In [[computing]], a '''network interface''' is a software or hardware [[Interface (computing)|interface]] between two pieces of equipment or [[protocol layer]]s in a [[computer network]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/nifs/definition.html What Is a Network Interface?]&lt;/ref&gt;

A network interface will usually have some form of [[network address]]. This may consist of a node identifier and a [[port number]] or may be a unique node ID in its own right.

Network interfaces provide standardized functions such as passing messages, connecting and disconnecting, etc.

==Examples==
* [[Computer port (hardware)]], an interface to other computers or peripherals 
* [[Network interface controller]], the device a computer uses to connect to a computer network&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/network-interface-card network interface card (NIC)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Network interface device]], a demarcation point for a telephone network
* [[Network socket]], a software interface to the network
* [[Port (computer networking)]], a protocol interface to the network

[[file:Network interface device ameritech.jpg|thumb|upright|Two simple NIDs, carrying six lines each, on the outside of a building]]
[[file:apl germany.jpeg|thumb|upright|A German copper phone line termination box called ''[[:de:Abschlusspunkt Linientechnik|Abschlusspunkt LinienTechnik]]'' (APL, &quot;[[Demarcation point]]&quot;)]]

In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''network interface device''' ('''NID'''; also known by several other names) is a device that serves as the [[demarcation point]] between the carrier's [[local loop]] and the customer's [[on-premises wiring|premises wiring]]. Outdoor telephone NIDs also provide the subscriber with access to the station wiring and serve as a convenient test point for verification of loop integrity and of the subscriber's inside wiring.

== Naming ==

Generically, an NID may also be called a '''network interface unit''' (NIU),&lt;ref name=&quot;1037cDEF&quot; /&gt; '''telephone network interface''' (TNI), '''system network interface''' (SNI), or '''telephone network box'''.

Australia's [[National Broadband Network]] uses the term ''[[Network Termination Device (NBN)|network termination device]]'' or NTD.

A '''smartjack''' is a type of NID with capabilities beyond simple electrical connection, such as diagnostics.

An ''[[#Optical network terminals|optical network terminal]]'' (ONT) is a type of NID used with [[fiber-to-the-premises]] applications.

== Wiring termination ==

The simplest NIDs are essentially just a specialized set of wiring [[terminal (electronics)|terminal]]s. These will typically take the form of a small, weather-proof box, mounted on the outside of the building. The [[telephone line]] from the [[telephone company]] will enter the NID and be connected to one side. The customer connects their wiring to the other side. A single NID enclosure may contain termination for a single line or multiple lines.

In its role as the demarcation point (dividing line), the NID separates the telephone company's equipment from the customer's wiring and equipment. The telephone company owns the NID itself, and all wiring up to it. Anything past the NID is the customer's responsibility. To facilitate this, there is typically a test jack inside the NID. Accessing the test jack disconnects the customer premises wiring from the [[public switched telephone network]] and allows the customer to plug a &quot;known good&quot; [[telephone]] into the jack to isolate trouble. If the telephone works at the test jack, the problem is the customer's wiring, and the customer is responsible for repair. If the telephone does not work, the line is faulty and the telephone company is responsible for repair.

Most NIDs also include &quot;circuit protectors&quot;, which are [[surge protector]]s for a telephone line. They protect customer wiring, equipment, and personnel from any transient [[energy]] on the line, such as from a [[lightning]] strike to a [[telephone pole]].

Simple NIDs contain no [[digital logic]]; they are &quot;dumb&quot; devices. They have no capabilities beyond wiring termination, circuit protection, and providing a place to connect test equipment.

== Smartjack ==
[[file:Network Interface Unit.jpg|thumb|upright|Three smartjacks for [[Digital Signal 1|T-1]] circuits, in two shelves; a [[66 block]] is on the left]]

Several types of NIDs provide more than just a terminal for the connection of wiring. Such NIDs are colloquially called ''smartjacks'' or [[Intelligent Network Interface Device]]s (INIDs) as an indication of their built-in &quot;intelligence&quot;, as opposed to a simple NID, which is just a wiring device. Smartjacks are typically used for more complicated types of telecommunications service, such as [[Digital Signal 1|T1 lines]]. [[Plain old telephone service]] lines generally cannot be equipped with smartjacks.

Despite the name, most smartjacks are much more than a simple [[telephone jack]]. One common form for a smartjack is a [[printed circuit board]] with a face plate on one edge, mounted in an enclosure.

A smartjack may provide signal conversion, converting codes and protocols (e.g. framing types) to the type needed by the customer equipment. It may buffer and/or regenerate the signal, to compensate for signal degradation from line transmission, similar to what a [[repeater]] does.

Smartjacks also typically provide diagnostic capabilities. A very common capability provided by a smartjack is [[loopback]], such that the signal from the telephone company is transmitted back to the telephone company. This allows the company to test the line from the central [[telephone exchange]], without the need to have test equipment at the customer site. The telephone company usually has the ability to remotely activate loopback, without even needing personnel at the customer site. When looped back, the customer equipment is disconnected from the line.

Additional smartjack diagnostic capabilities include [[alarm indication signal]], which reports trouble at one end of the line to the far end. This helps the telephone company know if trouble is present in the line, the smartjack, or customer equipment. Indicator lights to show configuration, status, and alarms are also common.

Smartjacks typically derive their operating power from the telephone line, rather than relying on premises electrical power, although this is not a universal rule.

== Optical network terminals ==
[[File:Tellabs ONT611 inside.jpeg|thumb|An optical network terminal mounted to the outside of a building, with the cover open]]

In fiber-to-the-premises systems, the signal is transmitted to the customer premises using [[fiber optic]] technologies. Unlike many conventional telephone technologies, this does not provide power for premises equipment, nor is it suitable for direct connection to customer equipment. An '''optical network terminal''' (ONT) is used to terminate the fiber optic line, [[multiplexing|demultiplex]] the signal into its component parts (voice [[telephone]], [[television]], and [[Internet access]]), and provide power to customer telephones. As the ONT must derive its power from the customer premises electrical supply, many ONTs have the option for a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] backup in order to maintain service in the event of a [[power outage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whatont&quot; /&gt;

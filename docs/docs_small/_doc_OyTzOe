[[File:三一运动.jpg|thumb|the [[March 1st Movement]] in 1919]]
After [[Emperor Gojong]] died in January 1919, with rumors of poisoning, independence rallies against the Japanese colonizers took place nationwide on 1 March 1919 (the [[March 1st Movement]]). This movement was suppressed by force and about 7,000 persons were killed by Japanese soldiers&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Park Eun-sik]] stated this amount is no more than hearsay and an inexact reasoning.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=Eun-sik|title=朝鮮独立運動の血史 1 (The Bloody History of the Korean Independence Movement)|year=1972|publisher=Tōyō Bunko|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050797?query=march%20first%20movement&amp;ct= |title=March 1st Movement |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211125737/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050797?query=march%20first%20movement&amp;ct= |archivedate=2007-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 2 million people took part in peaceful, pro-liberation rallies, although Japanese records claim participation of less than half million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ki-Baik 340&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lee Ki-baik|

The [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] was established in [[Shanghai]], China, in the aftermath of the March 1 Movement, which coordinated the liberation effort and resistance against Japanese rule. Some of the achievements of the Provisional Government included the [[Battle of Chingshanli]] of 1920 and the [[Yoon Bong-Gil|ambush of Japanese military leadership in China]] in 1932. The Provisional Government is considered to be the ''de jure'' government of the Korean people between 1919 and 1948. The legitimacy of the provisional government is enshrined into the preamble of the [[constitution]] of the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://korea.assembly.go.kr/res/low_01_read.jsp?boardid=1000000035 Constitution of the Republic of Korea: Preamble] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120710041912/http://korea.assembly.go.kr/res/low_01_read.jsp?boardid=1000000035 |date=2012-07-10 }}, The [[National Assembly of the Republic of Korea]].

So far as primary and secondary education in Korea were classified as being for “those habitually using the Korean language”, and for “those habitually using the Japanese language”. Thus, the ethnic Koreans could attend the schools primarily for Japanese, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;“The New Korea”, [[Alleyne Ireland]] 1926 E.P. Dutton &amp; Company pp.198-199&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1926, the Korean language was taught for 4 hours a week for the first and second year of a common school having a six-year course, 3 for the rest of the course. Both Japanese and Koreans paid school-fees, without exception. The average fee in a common school was about 25 cents a month. The educational assessment levied by District educational bodies, paid by the ethnic Koreans, averaged about 20 cents in 1923, per capita of the Korean population, that levied by school associations, paid by the ethnic Japanese, averaged about 3.30 dollars per capita of the Japanese population comprised within all the school associations in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;“The New Korea”, [[Alleyne Ireland]] 1926 E.P. Dutton &amp; Company pp.204,210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Koreans]] left the [[Korean Peninsula]] to exile in China, the United States, and elsewhere. Koreans in Manchuria formed resistance groups known as [[Dongnipgun]] (Liberation Army); they would travel in and out of the Sino-Korean border, fighting [[guerrilla warfare]] with Japanese forces. Some of them would group together in the 1940s as the [[Korean Liberation Army]], which took part in allied action in China and parts of South East Asia. Tens of thousands of Koreans also joined the [[People's Liberation Army]] and the [[National Revolutionary Army]].

The expulsion of the Japanese in 1945 removed practically all administrative and technical expertise. While the Japanese only comprised 2.6 percent of the population in 1944, they were an urban elite. The largest 50 cities contained 71 percent of the Japanese but only 12 percent of the Koreans. They largely dominated the ranks of the well-educated occupations. Meanwhile, 71 percent of the Koreans worked on farms.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan E.

Japan surrendered to the Allied Forces on August 15, 1945.

The unconditional surrender of Japan, combined with fundamental shifts in global politics and ideology, led to the division of Korea into two occupation zones, effectively starting on September 8, 1945. The [[United States]] administered the southern half of the peninsula and the [[Soviet Union]] took over the area north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]]. The Provisional Government was ignored, mainly due to American belief that it was too aligned with the communists.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|pp= 107–108}} This division was meant to be temporary and was intended to return a unified Korea back to its people after the United States, [[United Kingdom]], [[Soviet Union]], and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] could arrange a single government.

In December 1945, a conference convened in [[Moscow]] to discuss the future of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/decade19.asp |title=Avalon Project - A Decade of American Foreign Policy 1941-1949 - Interim Meeting of Foreign Ministers, Moscow |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430221645/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/decade19.asp |archivedate=2009-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 5-year trusteeship was discussed, and a joint Soviet-American commission was established. The commission met intermittently in [[Seoul]] but members deadlocked over the issue of establishing a national government. In September 1947, with no solution in sight, the [[United States]] submitted the Korean question to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. On December 12, 1948, the General Assembly of the [[United Nations]] recognised the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] as the sole legal government of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/66/IMG/NR004366.pdf?OpenElement |title=Resolution 195, UN Third General Assembly |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061108/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/66/IMG/NR004366.pdf?OpenElement |archivedate=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 1950, the [[Korean War]] broke out when North Korea breached the 38th parallel line to invade the South, ending any hope of a peaceful reunification for the time being. After the war, the 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva conference]] failed to adopt a solution for a unified Korea. Approximately 3 million people died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than [[World War II]] or the [[Vietnam War]], making it perhaps the deadliest conflict of the Cold War-era. In addition, virtually all of Korea's major cities were destroyed by the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim p.45&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Samuel S.|chapter=The Evolving Asian System|title=International Relations of Asia|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|year=2014|isbn=9781442226418|page=45|quote=With three of the four major Cold War fault lines—divided Germany, divided Korea, divided China, and divided Vietnam—East Asia acquired the dubious distinction of having engendered the largest number of armed conflicts resulting in higher fatalities between 1945 and 1994 than any other region or sub-region.

The number of South Korean military deaths has been given as in excess of 400,000; the South Korean Ministry of Defense puts the number of killed and missing at 281,257. Estimates of communist troops killed are about one-half million. The total number of Korean civilians who died in the fighting, which left almost every major city in North and South Korea in ruins, has been estimated at between 2 and 3 million. This adds up to almost 1 million military deaths and a possible 2.5 million civilians who were killed or died as a result of this extremely destructive conflict. The proportion of civilians killed in the major wars of this century (and not only in the major ones) has thus risen steadily. It reached about 42 percent in World War II and may have gone as high as 70 percent in the Korean War.&amp;nbsp;... we find that the ratio of civilian to military deaths [in Vietnam] is not substantially different from that of World War II and is well below that of the Korean War.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Korea (1953–present)===
{{main|History of North Korea|History of South Korea}}

Beginning with [[Syngman Rhee]] in 1948, a series of autocratic governments took power in South Korea with American support and influence.

With the coup of [[Park Chung-Hee]] in 1961, a new economic policy began. In order to promote economic development, a policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]] was applied. President Park developed the South Korean economy through a series of highly successful [[Five-Year Plans of South Korea|Five-Year Plans]]. South Korea's economic development was spearheaded by the [[chaebol]], family conglomerates such as [[Samsung]], [[Hyundai Group|Hyundai]], [[SK Group]], [[LG Corporation]]. The chaebol received state-backing via tax breaks and cheap loans, and took advantage of South Korea's inexpensive labor to produce exportable products.&lt;ref name=&quot;pagina12.com.ar&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/104906-corea-del-sur-no-es-un-milagro |title = Corea del Sur no es un milagro &amp;#124; Un Estado muy fuerte, industrialización, extrema flexibilización laboral y conglomerados familiares. El papel de EE.UU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government made education a very high priority to create a well-educated populace capable of productively contributing to the economy. Despite occasional political instability, the Korean economy subsequently saw enormous growth for nearly forty years, in a period known as the [[Miracle on the Han River]]. The unparalleled economic miracle brought South Korea from one of the poorest states in the world after the Korean War into a fully [[developed country]] within a generation.

South Korea eventually transitioned into a market-oriented democracy in 1987 largely due to popular demand for political reform, and then hosted the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], the second [[Summer Olympic Games]] to be held on the Asian continent, in the following year.

Moving on from cheap, lower-value light industry exports, the South Korean economy eventually moved onto more capital-intensive, higher-value industries, such as [[information technology]], [[shipbuilding]], auto manufacturing, and petroleum refining. Today, South Korea is a leading economy and a technological powerhouse, rivaling even countries such as the United States in [[information and communication technology]]. South Korean pop culture has also boomed abroad in recent years, in a phenomenon known as the [[Korean Wave]].

Due to Soviet Influence, North Korea established a communist government with a hereditary succession of leadership, with ties to China and the Soviet Union. Kim Il-sung became the supreme leader until his death in 1994, after which his son, Kim Jong-il took power. Kim Jong-il's son, Kim Jong-un, is the current leader, taking power after his father's death in 2011. After the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991, the North Korean economy went on a path of steep decline, and it is currently heavily reliant on international food aid and trade with China.

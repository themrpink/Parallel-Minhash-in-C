The railroad connected Paris with Marseille (1848) and then with Toulon and Nice (1864). Nice, [[Antibes]] and [[Hyères]] became popular winter resorts for European royalty, including [[Queen Victoria]]. Under Napoleon III, Marseille grew to a population of 250,000, including a very large Italian community. Toulon had a population of 80,000. The large cities like Marseille and Toulon saw the building of churches, opera houses, grand boulevards, and parks.

After the fall of Louis Napoleon following the defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], barricades went up in the streets of Marseille (23 March 1871) and the [[Communards]], led by Gaston Cremieux and following the lead of the [[Paris Commune]], took control of the city. The Commune was crushed by the army and Cremieux was executed on 30 November 1871. Though Provence was generally conservative, it often elected reformist leaders; Prime Minister [[Léon Gambetta]] was the son of a Marseille grocer, and future prime minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] was elected deputy from the Var in 1885.

The second half of the 19th century saw a revival of the [[Occitan language|Provençal language]] and culture, particularly traditional rural values. driven by a movement of writers and poets called the [[Félibrige]], led by poet [[Frédéric Mistral]]. Mistral achieved literary success with his poem [[Mirèio]] (''Mireille'' in French); he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1904.

=== 20th century ===
Between World War I and World War II, Provence was bitterly divided between the more conservative rural areas and the more radical big cities. There were widespread strikes in Marseille in 1919, and riots in Toulon in 1935.

After the defeat of France by Germany in June 1940, France was divided into an occupied zone and unoccupied zone, with Provence in the unoccupied zone. Parts of eastern Provence were occupied by Italian soldiers. Collaboration and passive resistance gradually gave way to more active resistance, particularly after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Communist Party became active in the resistance. [[Jean Moulin]], the deputy of [[Charles de Gaulle]], the leader of the Free France resistance movement, was parachuted into [[Eygalières]], in the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] on 2 January 1942 to unite the diverse resistance movements in all of France against the Germans.

In November 1942, following Allied landings in North Africa ([[Operation Torch]]), the Germans occupied all of Provence ([[Operation Attila (World War II)|Operation Attila]]) and then headed for Toulon ([[Case Anton]]). The French fleet at Toulon sabotaged its own ships to keep them from falling into German hands.

The Germans began a systematic rounding-up of French Jews and refugees from Nice and Marseille. Many thousands were taken to concentration camps, and few survived. A large quarter around the port of Marseille was emptied of inhabitants and dynamited, so it would not serve as a base for the resistance. Nonetheless, the resistance grew stronger; the leader of the pro-German militia, the Milice, in Marseille was assassinated in April 1943.

On 15 August 1944, two months after the Allied landings in Normandy ([[Operation Overlord]]), the [[Seventh United States Army]] under General [[Alexander Patch]], with a [[Free French]] corps under General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]], landed on the coast of the Var between [[Saint-Raphaël, Var|St. Raphael]] and [[Cavalaire]] ([[Operation Dragoon]]). The American forces moved north toward [[Manosque]], [[Sisteron]] and [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], while the French First Armored Division under General Vigier liberated Brignoles, Salon, Arles, and Avignon. The Germans in Toulon resisted until 27 August, and Marseille was not liberated until 25 August.

After the end of the War, Provence faced an enormous task of repair and reconstruction, particularly of the ports and railroads destroyed during the war. As part of this effort, the first modern concrete apartment block, the [[Unité d'habitation]] of [[Corbusier]], was built in Marseille in 1947–52. In 1962, Provence absorbed a large number of French citizens who left Algeria after its independence. Since that time, large North African communities settled in and around the big cities, particularly Marseille and Toulon.

In the 1940s, Provence underwent a cultural renewal, with the founding of the [[Avignon Festival]] of theatre (1947), the reopening of the [[Cannes Film Festival]] (begun in 1939), and many other major events. With the building of new highways, particularly the Paris Marseille autoroute which opened in 1970, Provence became destination for mass tourism from all over Europe. Many Europeans, particularly from Britain, bought summer houses in Provence. The arrival of the [[TGV]] high-speed trains shortened the trip from Paris to Marseille to less than four hours.

At the end of the 20th century, and the beginning of the 21st century, the residents of Provence were struggling to reconcile economic development and population growth with their desire to preserve the landscape and culture that make Provence unique.

== Geography ==
[[File:Map Gallia Tribes Towns.png|thumb|The Roman Province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] around 58 BC]]

The original Roman province was called Gallia Transalpina, then [[Gallia Narbonensis]], or simply ''Provincia Nostra'' ('Our Province') or ''Provincia''. It extended from the [[Alps]] to the [[Pyrenees]] and north to the [[Vaucluse]], with its capital in Narbo Martius (present-day [[Narbonne]]).

===Location and borders===

In the 15th century, the Conté of Provence was bounded by the [[Var (river)|Var]] river on the east, the [[Rhône]] river to the west, with the Mediterranean to the south, and a northern border that roughly followed the [[Durance]] river.

The [[Comtat Venaissin]], a territory which included [[Avignon]], and the principality of Orange were both papal states, ruled by the Pope from the 13th century until the [[French Revolution]].  At the end of the 14th century, another piece of Provence along the Italian border, including [[Nice]] and the lower Alps, was detached from Provence and attached to the lands of the Duke of [[Savoy]]. The lower Alps were re-attached to France after the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, but Nice did not return to France until 1860, during the reign of [[Napoleon III]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'', 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative region of [[Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur]] was created in 1982. It included Provence, plus the territory of the Comtat Venaissin around Avignon, the eastern portion of the [[Dauphiné]], and the former [[County of Nice]].

=== Rivers ===
[[File:France Avignon Total 1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Rhône]] at Avignon]]
The Rhône river, on the western border of Provence, is one of the major rivers of France, and has been a highway of commerce and communications between inland France and the Mediterranean for centuries. It rises as the effluent of the [[Rhône Glacier]] in [[Valais]], Switzerland, in the [[Saint-Gotthard massif]], at an altitude of 1753 m. It is joined by the river [[Saône]] at Lyon. Along the Rhône Valley, it is joined on the right bank by [[Cévennes]] rivers [[Eyrieux]], Ardèche, [[Cèze]] and [[Gardon]] or [[Gard]], on the left Alps bank by rivers [[Isère]], Drôme, [[Ouvèze]] and Durance. At Arles, the Rhône divides itself in two arms, forming the [[Camargue]] delta, with all branches flowing into the Mediterranean Sea. One arm is called the &quot;Grand Rhône&quot;; the other one is the &quot;Petit Rhône&quot;.
[[File:Belvédère du Tilleul-Route des Crêtes-Gorges du Verdon.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Verdon Gorge|Gorge du Verdon]].]]
The Durance river, a tributary of the Rhône, has its source in the Alps near [[Briançon]]. It flows south-west through [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]], [[Sisteron]], [[Manosque]], [[Cavaillon]], and [[Avignon]], where it meets the Rhône.

The [[Verdon River]] is a tributary of the Durance, rising at an altitude of 2,400 metres in the southwestern Alps near Barcelonette, and flowing southwest for 175 kilometres through the [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]] and [[Var (department)|Var]] (départements) before it reaches the Durance at near [[Vinon-sur-Verdon]], south of [[Manosque]]. The Verdon is best known for its [[canyon]], the [[Verdon Gorge]]. This limestone canyon, also called the 'Grand Canyon of Verdon', 20 kilometres in length and more than 300 metres deep, is a popular climbing and sight-seeing area.

The [[Var River]] rises near the Col de la Cayolle (2,326 m/7,631&amp;nbsp;ft) in the [[Maritime Alps]] and flows generally southeast for {{convert|120|km}} into the Mediterranean between Nice and [[Saint-Laurent-du-Var]]. Before Nice was returned to France in 1860, the Var marked the eastern border of France along the Mediterranean. The Var is the unique case in France of a river giving a name to a department, but not flowing through that department (due to subsequent adjustments to the department's boundaries).

=== The Camargue ===
With an area of over 930&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (360&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the [[Camargue]] is western Europe's largest river delta (technically an island, as it is wholly surrounded by water). It is a vast plain comprising large [[brine]] lagoons or ''étangs'', cut off from the sea by sandbars and encircled by [[Phragmites|reed]]-covered [[marsh]]es which are in turn surrounded by a large cultivated area. It is home to more than 400 species of birds, the brine ponds providing one of the few European habitats for the [[greater flamingo]].

=== Mountains ===
[[File:Alpilles landscape.jpg|thumb|[[Alpilles]] landscape near Le Destet.]]
By considering the [[Maritime Alps]], along the border with Italy, as a part of the cultural Provence, they constitute the highest elevations of the region (the [[Punta dell'Argentera]] has an elevation of 3,297 m). They form the border between the French ''[[département in France|département]]'' [[Alpes-Maritimes]] and the Italian [[province of Cuneo]]. [[Mercantour National Park]] is located in the Maritime Alps. On the other hand, if the ''département'' [[Hautes Alpes]] is also considered as part of the modern Provence, then the alpin [[Massif des Écrins|Écrins mountains]] represent the highest elevations of the region with the [[Barre des Écrins]] culminating at 4102m.

[[File:Mont ventoux from mirabel.jpg|thumb|left|View of Mont Ventoux from [[Mirabel-aux-Baronnies]].]]
[[File:Vallon de Mollières 2004 07.jpg|thumb|left|Vallon de Mollières, [[Mercantour National Park]].]]
Outside of the Maritime Alps, [[Mont Ventoux]] (Occitan: Ventor in classical norm or Ventour in Mistralian norm), at {{convert|1909|m|sigfig=4}}, is the highest peak in Provence. It is located some 20&amp;nbsp;km north-east of Carpentras, Vaucluse. On the north side, the mountain borders the Drôme département. It is nicknamed the &quot;Giant of Provence&quot;, or &quot;The Bald Mountain&quot;. Although geologically part of the [[Alps]], is often considered to be separate from them, due to the lack of mountains of a similar height nearby. It stands alone to the west of the [[Luberon]] range, and just to the east of the [[Dentelles de Montmirail]], its foothills. The top of the mountain is bare limestone without vegetation or trees. The white limestone on the mountain's barren peak means it appears from a distance to be snow-capped all year round (its snow cover actually lasts from December to April).

The [[Alpilles]] are a chain of small mountains located about {{convert|20|km}} south of Avignon. Although they are not particularly high – only some {{convert|387|m}} at their highest point – the Alpilles stand out since they rise abruptly from the plain of the [[Rhône]] valley. The range is about 25&amp;nbsp;km long by about 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;km wide, running in an east–west direction between the Rhône and Durance rivers. The landscape of the Alpilles is one of arid [[limestone]] peaks separated by dry valleys.

[[File:Paul Cézanne 107.jpg|thumb|''[[Mont Sainte-Victoire (Cézanne)|Mont Sainte-Victoire]]'', painted by Paul Cézanne]]
[[Montagne Sainte-Victoire]] is probably the best-known mountain in Provence, thanks to the painter Paul Cézanne, who could see it from his home, and painted it frequently.
It is a [[limestone]] mountain ridge which extends over 18 kilometres between the [[Départements of France|départements]] of [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] and [[Var (département)|Var]]. Its highest point is the ''Pic des mouches'' at 1,011&amp;nbsp;m.

The  Massif des Maures (Mountains of the Moors) is a small chain of mountains that lies along the coast of the Mediterranean in the Var Department between [[Hyères]] et [[Fréjus]]. Its highest point is the signal de la Sauvette, 780 metres high. The name is a souvenir of the [[Moors]] (''Maures'' in Old French), [[Arabs]] and [[Berber people|Berbers]] from North Africa, who settled on the coast of Provence in the 9th and 10th centuries. The Massif des Maures extends about sixty kilometres along the coast, and reaches inland about thirty kilometres. On the north it is bordered by a depression which is followed by the ''[[Route nationale|routes nationales]]'' 97 and 7, and the railroad line between Toulon and Nice. On the south it ends abruptly at the Mediterranean, forming a broken and abrupt coastline.

The peninsula of [[Saint-Tropez]] is part of the Massif des Maures, along with the [[Giens Peninsula]] and the islands offshore of [[Îles d'Hyères|Hyères]]; [[Porquerolles]], Port-Cros, and [[île du Levant]]. Cape Sicié, west of Toulon, as well as the Massif de Tanneron, belong geologically to the Massif des Maures.

=== The Calanques ===
[[File:Calanques.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Calanque de Sugiton]]]]

The [[Calanques]] are a dramatic feature of the Provence coast, a 20-km long series of narrow inlets in the cliffs of the coastline between Marseille on the west and [[Cassis, Bouches-du-Rhône|Cassis]] on the east. The best known examples of this formation can be found in the [[Massif des Calanques]]. The highest peak in the massif is [[Mont Puget]], 565 metres high.

The best known calanques of the Massif des Calanques include the [[Calanque de Sormiou]], the [[Calanque de Morgiou]], the Calanque d'En-Vau, the Calanque de Port-Pin and the [[Calanque de Sugiton]].

Calanques are remains of ancient river mouths formed mostly during [[Tertiary]]. Later, during [[Quaternary glaciation]], as glaciers swept by, they further deepened those valleys which would eventually (at the end of the last glaciation) be invaded with sea and become calanques.
[[File:Garrigue 2007-09-20.JPG|thumb|The [[Garrigue]], typical landscape of Provence]]

The [[Cosquer cave]] is an underwater grotto in the Calanque de Morgiou, {{convert|37|m}} underwater, that was inhabited during [[Paleolithic]] era, when the sea level was much lower than today. Its walls are covered with paintings and engravings dating back to between 27,000 and 19,000 BC, depicting animals such as bison, ibex, and horses, as well as sea mammals such as seals, and at least one bird, the auk.

=== Landscapes ===
The [[garrigue]] is the typical landscape of Provence; it is a type of low, soft-leaved [[scrubland]] or [[chaparral]] found on limestone soils around the [[Mediterranean Basin]], generally near the seacoast, where the climate is moderate, but where there are annual summer drought conditions.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Mediterranean climate]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juniper]] and stunted [[holm oak]]s are the typical trees; aromatic lime-tolerant shrubs such as [[lavender]], [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[rosemary]], [[wild thyme]] and ''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]'' are common garrigue plants. The open landscape of the garrigue is punctuated by dense thickets of [[Kermes oak]].

== Climate ==
[[File:Mistral sur le Frioul.JPG|right|thumb|Mistral wind blowing near Marseille. In the center is the [[Château d'If]]]]
Most of Provence has a [[Mediterranean climate]], characterised by hot, dry summers, mild winters, little snow, and abundant sunshine. Within Provence there are micro-climates and local variations, ranging from the Alpine climate inland from Nice to the continental climate in the northern [[Vaucluse]]. The [[winds of Provence]] are an important feature of the climate, particularly the [[Mistral (wind)|mistral]], a cold, dry wind which, especially in the winter, blows down the Rhône Valley to the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] and the [[Var (department)|Var]] Departments, and often reaches over one hundred kilometres an hour.

=== Bouches-du-Rhône ===
Marseille, in the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], has an average of 59 days of rain a year, though when it does rain the rain is often torrential; the average annual rainfall is 544.4&amp;nbsp;mm. It snows an average of 2.3 days a year, and the snow rarely remains long. Marseille has an average of 2835.5 hours of sunshine a year. The average minimum temperature in January is 2.3&amp;nbsp;°C., and the average maximum temperature in July is 29.3&amp;nbsp;°C. The mistral blows an average of one hundred days a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoclimat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/index.php?s=07650&amp;aff=details |title=Précipitations à Marseille |language=fr |publisher=Infoclimat.fr |access-date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Var ===
[[Toulon]] and the [[Var (department)|Var department]] (which includes [[St. Tropez]] and [[Hyères]]) have a climate slightly warmer, dryer and sunnier than Nice and the Alpes-Maritime, but also less sheltered from the wind. Toulon has an average of 2899.3 hours of sunshine a year, making it the sunniest city in metropolitan France,&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/index.php?s=07660&amp;aff=details Precipitations a Toulon].&lt;/ref&gt; The average maximum daily temperature in August is 29.1&amp;nbsp;°C., and the average daily minimum temperature in January is 5.8&amp;nbsp;°C. The average annual rainfall is 665&amp;nbsp;mm, with the most rain from October to November. Strong winds blow an average of 118 days a year in Toulon, compared with 76 days at Fréjus further east. The strongest Mistral wind recorded in Toulon was 130 kilometres an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Météo-France. site&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alpes-Maritimes ===
[[Nice]] and the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] department are sheltered by the Alps, and are the most protected part of the Mediterranean coast. The winds in this department are usually gentle, blowing from the sea to the land, though sometimes the mistral blows strongly from the northwest, or, turned by the mountains, from the east. In 1956, a mistral wind from the northwest reached the speed of 180 kilometres an hour at Nice airport. Sometimes in summer the [[sirocco]] brings high temperatures and reddish desert sand from Africa (see [[Winds of Provence]]).

Rainfall is infrequent, 63 days a year, but can be torrential, particularly in September, when storms and rain are caused by the difference between the colder air inland and the warm Mediterranean water temperature (20–24 degrees&amp;nbsp;C.). The average annual rainfall in Nice is 767&amp;nbsp;mm, more than in Paris, but concentrated in fewer days.

Snow is extremely rare, usually falling once every ten years. 1956 was a very exceptional year, when 20 centimetres of snow blanketed the coast. In January 1985 the coast between Cannes and Menton received 30 to 40 centimetres of snow. In the mountains, the snow is present from November to May.

Nice has an annual average of 2694 hours of sunshine. The average maximum daily temperature in Nice in August is 28&amp;nbsp;°C., and the average minimum daily temperature in January is 6&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} {{cite web|url=http://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/index.php?s=07690&amp;aff=details |title=Infoclimat – Météo en temps réel – observations previsions climatologie forum |language=fr |publisher=Infoclimat.fr |access-date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alpes-de-Haute-Provence ===
The department of [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]] has a Mediterranean climate in the lower valleys under one thousand metres in altitude and an [[alpine climate]] in the high valleys, such as the valleys of the Blanche, the Haut Verdon and the [[Ubaye Valley|Ubaye]], which are over 2500 metres high. The alpine climate in the higher mountains is moderated by the warmer air from the Mediterranean.

Haute-Provence has unusually high summer temperatures for its altitude and latitude ([[44th parallel north|44 degrees north]]). The average summer temperature is 22 to 23&amp;nbsp;°C. at an altitude of 400 metres, and 18 to 19&amp;nbsp;°C. at the altitude of 1000 metres; and the winter average temperature is 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;°C. at 400 metres and 0 C. at 1000 metres. The lower valleys have 50 days of freezing temperatures a year, more in the higher valleys. Sometimes the temperatures in the high valleys can reach −30&amp;nbsp;°C. Because of this combination of high mountains and Mediterranean air, it is not unusual that the region frequently has some of the lowest winter temperatures and some of the hottest summer temperatures in France.

Rainfall in Haute-Provence is infrequent – 60 to 80 days a year – but can be torrential; 650 to 900&amp;nbsp;mm. a year in the foothills and plateaus of the southwest, and in the valley of the Ubaye; and 900 to 1500&amp;nbsp;mm. in the mountains. Most rainfall comes in the autumn, in brief and intense storms; from mid-June to mid-August, rain falls during brief but violent thunderstorms. Thunder can be heard 30 to 40 days a year.

Snow falls in the mountains from November to May, and in midwinter can be found down to altitude of 1000–1200 metres on the shady side of the mountains and 1300 to 1600 metres on the sunny side. Snowfalls are usually fairly light, and melt rapidly.

The [[Mistral (wind)|mistral]], a wind blowing from the north and the northwest, is a feature of the climate in the western part of the department, bringing clear and dry weather. The eastern part of the department is more protected from the mistral. A southerly wind known as the [[Marin (wind)|marin]] brings warm air, clouds and rain.

Haute-Provence is one of the sunniest regions of France, with an average of between 2,550 and 2,650 hours of sunshine annually in the north of the department, and 2,700 to 2,800 hours in the southwest. The clear nights and sunny days cause a sharp difference between nighttime and daytime temperatures. Because of the clear nights, the region is home of important observatories, such as the [[Observatory of Haute-Provence]] in Saint-Michel-Observatoire near [[Forcalquier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/index.php?s=07588&amp;aff=details |title=Infoclimat – Météo en temps réel – observations previsions climatologie forum |language=fr |publisher=Infoclimat.fr |access-date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Vaucluse ===
The [[Vaucluse]] is the meeting point of three of the four different climatic zones of France; it has a [[Mediterranean climate]] in the south, an [[alpine climate]] in the northeast, around the mountains of Vaucluse and the massif of the [[Baronnies]]; and a [[continental climate]] in the northwest. The close proximity of these three different climates tends to moderate all of them, and the Mediterranean climate usually prevails.

[[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]] in the Vaucluse has 2595 hours of sunshine a year. It rains an average of 80 days a year, for a total of 693.4&amp;nbsp;mm a year. The maximum average temperature in July is 29.6&amp;nbsp;°C., and the average minimum temperature in January is 1.3&amp;nbsp;°C. There are an average of 110 days of strong winds a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/index.php?s=07579&amp;aff=details |title=source: infoclimat.fr précipitations à Orange |language=fr |publisher=Infoclimat.fr |access-date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

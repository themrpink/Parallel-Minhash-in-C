This can find template arguments, URLs, links, html, etc. It has two forms, one is an indexed search, and the other is [[Regular expression|regex]]-based.

|These are [[regular expressions]]. They use a lot of processing power, so we can only allow a few at a time on the search cluster, but they are very powerful. The version with the extra &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; runs the expression case-insensitive, and is even less efficient. Regex searches are likely to time out unless you further limit the search in some way, such as by including another parameter or a search term outside of the insource component of the search string. (For example, &lt;code&gt;X* intitle:/X/&lt;/code&gt; to restrict the search to initial position.) For more details, see [[mw:Help:CirrusSearch#Regular expression searches]].

==== incategory: ====
{{anchor|incategory|Incategory}}&lt;!-- Please leave anchors in place. Section redirects point to them. --&gt;
{{shortcut|H:INCAT|H:INCATEGORY}}

Given as &quot;incategory:{{var|category}}&quot;, where {{var|[[Help:Category|category]]}} is the [[Help:Page name|page name]] of a category page, it lists pages with &lt;kbd&gt;[[Category:{{var|page name}}]]&lt;/kbd&gt; in their wikitext. (Editors searching in namespaces other than mainspace will need to know [[WP:TCAT|the limitations]] these search results may contain.) Space characters in a page name can be replaced with an underscore instead of using double quotes; either way works, and even both at once works (but not on commons). &quot;Incategory:&quot; will also return pages in the adjacent subcategory; see for example, {{nowrap|&quot;{{search link|category: incategory:History}}&quot;}}. Multiple &quot;incategory&quot; filters may be applied. A more graphical alternative to a single filter is at [[Special:CategoryTree]]. Because categories are important structures for {{em|searching}} for related articles, any use of this prefix is particularly effective for searching. For more on using the categories themselves to find articles, see [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Categories]].

!  Query
!  Description
|-
|  {{search link|ammonia incategory:German_chemists}}
|  Starting with the articles listed at ''[[:Category: German chemists]]'', only the ones that have the word &quot;ammonia&quot; in their text
|-
|  {{search link|incategory:&quot;Suspension bridges in the United States&quot; incategory:Bridges_in_New_York_City}}
|  Articles that are [[WP:CI|common to both categories]]â€”the suspension bridges in New York City
|-
|  {{search link|&quot;feral cat&quot; -incategory:&quot;Category:Cats in the United Kingdom&quot;}}
|  Articles that contain the phrase &quot;feral cat&quot;, but not listed in ''[[:Category:Cats in the United Kingdom]]''
|}

==== deepcategory: ====
{{shortcut|H:DEEPCAT}}

Also &lt;code&gt;deepcat:&lt;/code&gt;, this allows you to search in a category and all its subcategories. The depth of the tree is currently limited to 5 levels, and the overall number of categories is limited to 256.

Example:

&lt;code&gt;deepcat:&quot;Musicals by topic&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

Finds articles that are in [[:Category:Musicals by topic]] or any of its subcategories.

==== prefix: ====
{{shortcut|H:PREFIX}}

&quot;prefix:{{var|page name}}&quot; patterns {{em|only the beginning characters}} of a [[WP:Page name|page name]]. Because the &quot;beginning&quot; characters can, if you need, go on to include the characters all the way to the end of the page name, prefix must include spaces, since page names often include spaces. For this reason ''prefix:'' must only ever be given at the {{em|last part}} of a search box query, and next character after the colon cannot be a space. Prefix does not search for partial namespace names, but requires at least a full namespace name to start to find pages, but ''prefix:'' also recognizes an [[WP:Namespace#Aliases|alias]] of a namespace, and it recognizes redirects (or shortcut). Prefix is the most widely used and powerful filter as it can mimic the namespace filter, and because ''intitle:'' cannot easily target a single page, even together with other filters. [[Special:PrefixIndex]] is a MediaWiki, graphical, version, using only ''prefix:'' to find pages.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  Query

|  {{search link|Salvage wreck prefix:USS}}
|  Articles containing the words ''salvage'' and ''wreck'' whose title starts with the characters &quot;USS&quot;

|  ''Speed of light'' talk pages with the terms &quot;particle&quot; and &quot;wave&quot;, including the current and the archived talk pages
|-
|  {{search link|wave particle prefix:Talk:Speed of light/}}
|  Same search, but only in the [[WP:Archive|archived]] [[WP:Subpage|subpages]]
|-
|  {{search link|&quot;portal namespace&quot;  readers prefix:Wikipedia talk:}}
| Is equivalent to 'Wikipedia talk:&quot;portal namespace&quot; readers'
|-
|  {{search link|language prefix:Portal:Chi}}
|  Portal namespace page names that begin with &quot;Portal:Chi&quot; and have the word ''language'' in the page
|}

==== linksto: ====
{{shortcut|H:LINKSTO}}

&quot;linksto:{{var|page name}}&quot; searches in pages that link to the given page. Can be used negatively by prefixing a hyphen, which will return pages that {{em|do not}} link to the given page. Unlike with some other keywords, the page name is case-sensitive.

|}

==== subpageof: ====
{{shortcut|H:SUBOF}}

{{A note|Important note}} This only works right in the search box of the search page or search results page.

This limits searches to subpages of the specified page. You can also negate the subpages from a search by preceding subpageof: with a hyphen. Note that articles on Wikipedia generally don't have subpages, but the pages of the other namespaces do. Therefore, use the namespace parameter also. Here are some examples:


To look at all the subpages of a user, try this:

&lt;code&gt;User: subpageof:AzaToth&lt;/code&gt;

That will display all the subpages of [[User:AzaToth]]


To make sure Articles for deletion pages do not show up in the results of a Wikipedia namespace search, try this:

&lt;code&gt;Wikipedia:&quot;Hi there&quot; -subpageof:&quot;Articles for deletion&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

That'll show pages from the Wikipedia namespace with &quot;Hi there&quot; in them, and the list of results will not be cluttered with any Articles for deletion debates (many thousands of which are in the Wikipedia namespace). Notice the use of the hyphen (that makes it mean &quot;not subpages of&quot;.)

==== hastemplate: ====
{{shortcut|H:HASTEMP}}

This finds pages that use the specified template. Input the canonical page name to find all usage of the template, but use any of its redirect page names finds just that naming. Namespace aliases are accepted, capitalization is entirely ignored, and redirects are found, all in one name-search.

This is more thorough than insource:, in that it will find meta-templates (templates called by another template). Meta-templates don't show up in the local page's wikitext.


Examples of hastemplate: usage:

&lt;code&gt;hastemplate:&quot;Article for deletion/dated&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

This lets you find all the articles being considered for deletion.


&lt;code&gt;intitle:&quot;Outline of &quot; -hastemplate:&quot;Outline footer&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

This lets you find Wikipedia outlines that are lacking the outline footer template. (Notice the use of the hyphen to indicate &quot;NOT&quot;).

== Search page ==
[[File:Search page.PNG|thumb|300px|alt=Wikipedia special search box|The search page.]]

The search page features a search box, with some links to search domains beneath it. For information on what can by typed into the search box, see [[#Search string syntax|Search string syntax]] above.

The main difference between this search box and the one that appears on article pages is that exact matches on this one will not navigate you directly to an article page. This search box will produce the [[#Search results page|search results page]] showing what all matches your search on Wikipedia.

To get to the search page, do an empty search (press {{Keypress|Enter}} while in the [[#Search box|search box]] before typing anything else in), or click on the magnifying glass in the search box. The link [[Special:Search]], which can be inserted onto user pages or project pages, for example, also leads to the search page.

For an explanation of the controls available on the search page, see [[#Refining results|Refining results]] below.

While the entire contents of the search page is included in the [[#Search results page|search results page]], it is a distinct page. User scripts might be designed to work on the search results page but not the search page, for example.

== Search results page ==
{{shortcut|H:RESULTS}}

The search results page looks just like the [[#Search page|search page]], with the results for your search query presented below it. For information on what can by typed into the search box, see [[#Search string syntax|Search string syntax]] above.

The search results page is displayed when a search is done from the search page, when a search from the regular [[#Search box|search box]] does not exactly match a page title, or when any parameters or special characters are included in a [[#Search string|search string]].

=== Understanding search results ===

The search string entered will be displayed in the search box on the page, in case you wish to modify it.

Spelling corrections and query corrections are offered at the top of the results (''see [[#Preliminary reports|Preliminary reports]], below'').

Note that search results include content from templates displayed on the pages searched.

The order that search results are presented in is based on the page ranking software.

Results match word stems, along with their various tenses (past tense, plural tense, etc.), except for anything included between double quotation marks. ''See [[#Stem matching|Stem matching]], below.''

Throughout the results, matching terms are highlighted in bold. All matches in the title show for sure, while matches within the details may show, but not if they are far apart on the page.

Matches are included for section headings, members of matching categories, and destination pages of redirects. These will show off to the side of the page name, parenthetically.

A single result (one each) from selected sister projects appears on the right side of the page (the most likely relevant match for each). This feature may be permanently turned off in [[Special:Preferences|Preferences]].

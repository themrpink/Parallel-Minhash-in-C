====History====
The [[Jiangnan]] region, at the [[Yangtze River Delta]], has a long history of constructing polders. Most of these projects were performed between the 10th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liao, Qiyu 繆启愉 |title=Taihu Tangpu Weitian Shi Yanjiu 太湖塘浦圩田史研究 [The research of the dikes and polders of Lake Tai] |date=1985 |publisher=Nongye Chubanshe |location=Beijing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government also assisted local communities in constructing dikes for swampland water drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xie, Shi 谢湜 |title=&quot;11 Shiji Taihu Diqu Nongtian Shuili Geju de Xingcheng&quot; 11 世纪太湖地区农田水利格局的形成 [The formation of water management system in the farmland of the Lake Tai region in the eleventh century] |journal=Journal of Sun Yat-sen University |date=2010 |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=94–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lijia (里甲) self-monitoring system  of 110 households under a ''lizhang'' (里长) headman was used for the purposes of service administration and tax collection in the polder, with a ''liangzhang'' (粮长, grain chief) responsible for maintaining the water system and a ''tangzhang'' (塘长, dike chief）for polder maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamashima, Atsutoshi 滨岛敦俊 |title=Mindai Kōnan nōson shakai no kenkyū 明代江南農村社会の研究 [Rural Society in Jiangnan during the Ming Dynasty |date=1982 |publisher=Tokyo University Press |location=Tokyo |pages=9–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maurice Ravel 1925.jpg|thumb|alt=slender, middle-aged man, clean-shaven with full head of hair, seen in profile|Ravel in 1925]]

'''Joseph Maurice Ravel''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɔzɛf mɔʁis ʁavɛl|lang}};{{refn|({{IPAc-en|r|ə|ˈ|v|ɛ|l|,_|r|æ|ˈ|v|ɛ|l}} {{respell|rə|VEL|,_|rav|EL}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Oxford&amp;nbsp;Dictionaries|Ravel, Maurice|accessdate=6 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Ravel|accessdate=6 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/maurice-ravel|title=Ravel, Maurice|work=[[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]]|publisher=[[Longman]]|accessdate=6 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} 7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor. He is often associated with [[Impressionism in music|impressionism]] along with his elder contemporary [[Claude Debussy]], although both composers rejected the term. In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer.

Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the [[Paris Conservatoire]]; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of modernism, [[baroque music|baroque]], [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]] and, in his later works, [[jazz]]. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, ''[[Boléro]]'' (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' is the best known.

A slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries. Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music. Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration. Some of his piano music, such as ''[[Gaspard de la nuit]]'' (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'' (1912) require skilful &lt;!--- not AmE &quot;skillful&quot;--&gt; balance in performance.

Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public. From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
[[File:Ravel-and-parents.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|alt=head-and=shoulder shots of bearded man, youngish woman and small child|Joseph Ravel (1875), Marie Ravel (1870) and Maurice Ravel aged four (1879)]]
Ravel was born in the [[Northern Basque Country|Basque]] town of [[Ciboure]], France, near [[Biarritz]], {{convert|18|km|mi}} from the Spanish border. His father, [[Pierre-Joseph Ravel]], was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in [[Versoix]] near the Franco-Swiss border.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2011), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Joseph's family is described in some sources as French and in others as Swiss; Versoix is in present-day (2015) Switzerland, but as the historian Philippe Morant observes, the nationality of families from the area changed several times over the generations as borders were moved; Joseph held a French passport,&lt;ref name=n390&gt;Nichols (2011), p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; but Ravel preferred to say simply that his paternal ancestors came from the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]].&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Nichols (2011), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} His mother, Marie, ''née'' Delouart, was [[Basque people|Basque]] but had grown up in Madrid. In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status – Marie was illegitimate and barely literate – but the marriage was a happy one.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2011), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early [[internal combustion engine]] and a notorious circus machine, the &quot;Whirlwind of Death&quot;, an automotive [[loop-the-loop]] that was a major attraction until a fatal accident at [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum and Bailey's Circus]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;James, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Ravel's parents were [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]; Marie was also something of a [[Freethought|free-thinker]], a trait inherited by her elder son.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1991), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born. (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Orenstein, 1991, p. 8&quot;/&gt; Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orenstein, 1991, p. 8&quot;&gt;Orenstein (1991), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1995), pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1991), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In later life, Ravel recalled, &quot;Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music. My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Goss, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer [[Roger Nichols (musical scholar)|Roger Nichols]] suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father.&lt;ref name=n9/&gt;

When he was seven, Ravel started piano lessons with Henry Ghys, a friend of [[Emmanuel Chabrier]]; five years later, in 1887, he began studying [[harmony]], [[counterpoint]] and composition with Charles-René, a pupil of [[Léo Delibes]].&lt;ref name=n9&gt;Nichols (2011), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy.&lt;ref&gt;Goss, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Charles-René found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him &quot;and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Goss, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], variations on a theme by [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]] and a single movement of a piano sonata.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Kelly, Barbara L. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52145 &quot;Ravel, Maurice&quot;], ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford University Press, retrieved 26 February 2015 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; They survive only in fragmentary form.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1967), p. 475&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist [[Ricardo Viñes]], who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music.&lt;ref&gt;James, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The two shared an appreciation of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], Russian music, and the writings of [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orenstein, 1991, p. 16&quot;&gt;Orenstein (1991), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the [[Russian Symphony Concerts|new Russian works]] conducted by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1991), pp. 11–12; and Nichols (2011), pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary [[Claude Debussy]], as did the exotic sound of the Javanese [[gamelan]], also heard during the Exposition.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

[[Émile Decombes]] took over as Ravel's piano teacher in 1889; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance.&lt;ref name=ln9&gt;[[François Lesure|Lesure]] and Nectoux, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Aged fourteen, he took part in a concert at the [[Salle Érard]] along with other pupils of Decombes, including [[Reynaldo Hahn]] and [[Alfred Cortot]].&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1991), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Conservatoire===
With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. In November 1889, playing music by [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eugène Anthiome.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2011), pp. 11 and 390&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student.&lt;ref name=o92&gt;Orenstein (1995), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer. The musicologist [[Arbie Orenstein]] writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period &quot;of immense growth{{nbsp}}... from adolescence to maturity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orenstein, 1991, p. 14&quot;&gt;Orenstein (1991), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Classe Bériot 1895.jpg|thumb|left|alt=outdoor group photograph of a small class of students with their professor|Piano class of [[Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot|Charles de Bériot]] in 1895, with Ravel on the left]]
In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of [[Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot]], for piano, and [[Émile Pessard]], for harmony.&lt;ref name=ln9/&gt; He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from Bériot but, in the words of the musicologist [[Barbara L. Kelly]], he &quot;was only teachable on his own terms&quot;.&lt;ref name=k2/&gt; His later teacher [[Gabriel Fauré]] understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s.&lt;ref name=k2&gt;Kelly (2000), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes.{{#tag:ref|Students who failed in three consecutive years to win a competitive medal were automatically expelled (&quot;faute de récompense&quot;) from their course.&lt;ref name=ln9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2011), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: ''Sérénade grotesque'', for piano, and &quot;Ballade de la Reine morte d'aimer&quot;,{{#tag:ref|&quot;Ballad of the queen who died of love&quot;|group= n}} a ''[[mélodie]]'' setting a poem by Roland de Marès (both 1893).&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Viñes and Cortot were.{{#tag:ref|When he was a boy his mother had occasionally had to bribe him to do his piano exercises,&lt;ref name=o92/&gt; and throughout his life colleagues commented on his aversion to practice.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (1987), pp. 73 and 91&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer.&lt;ref name=&quot;o92&quot;/&gt; From this point he concentrated on composition. His works from the period include the songs &quot;Un grand sommeil noir&quot; and &quot;D'Anne jouant de l'espinette&quot; to words by [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Clément Marot]],&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Respectively, &quot;A great black sleep&quot; and &quot;Anne playing the [[spinet]]&quot;.|group= n}} and the piano pieces ''[[Menuet antique]]'' and ''Habanera'' (for four hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the ''[[Rapsodie espagnole]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jankélévitch, pp. 8 and 20&lt;/ref&gt; At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to [[Erik Satie]], who was earning a living as a café pianist. Ravel was one of the first musicians – Debussy was another – who recognised Satie's originality and talent.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (1987), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them &quot;of inestimable value&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Orenstein (1991), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fauré-by-Eugéne-Pirou.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=portrait of middle-aged man with white hair and moustache|[[Gabriel Fauré]], Ravel's teacher and supporter]]
In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with Fauré, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with [[André Gedalge]].&lt;ref name=ln9/&gt; Both these teachers, particularly Fauré, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; As Ravel's course progressed, Fauré reported &quot;a distinct gain in maturity{{nbsp}}... engaging wealth of imagination&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (1977), pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, [[Théodore Dubois]], who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2011), p. 35; and Orenstein (1991), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, according to a fellow student, [[Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi]], he was &quot;a marked man, against whom all weapons were good&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (1987), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote some substantial works while studying with Fauré, including the overture ''[[Shéhérazade (Ravel)|Shéhérazade]]'' and a violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900. As a former student he was allowed to attend Fauré's classes as a non-participating &quot;auditeur&quot; until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (1977), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: ''[[Pavane pour une infante défunte]]'' (&quot;[[Pavane]] for a dead princess&quot;).&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[[Richard Langham Smith|Langham Smith, Richard]]. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/6fdd3b3e-1ea6-4da9-8d6f-8f8de01c133a &quot;Maurice Ravel – Biography&quot;], BBC, retrieved 4 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally a solo piano work, commissioned by the [[Winnaretta Singer|Princesse de Polignac]].&lt;ref&gt;Larner, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Ravel produced an orchestral version eleven years later.&lt;ref name=ln9/&gt;|group= n}} In 1897 he conducted the first performance of the ''Shéhérazade'' overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics. One described the piece as &quot;a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School&quot; and called Ravel a &quot;mediocrely gifted debutant{{nbsp}}... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years, if he works hard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1991), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|This critic was &quot;Willy&quot;, [[Henri Gauthier-Villars]], who came to be an admirer of Ravel. Ravel came to share his poor view of the overture, calling it &quot;a clumsy botch-up&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (1977), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Another critic, [[Pierre Lalo]], thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].&lt;ref name=n30/&gt; Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic.&lt;ref name=n30&gt;Nichols (2011), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

From the start of his career, Ravel appeared calmly indifferent to blame or praise. Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (1987), pp. 118 and 184&lt;/ref&gt; The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own, perfectionist and severely self-critical.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1991), pp. 19 and 104&lt;/ref&gt; At twenty years of age he was, in the words of the biographer Burnett James, &quot;self-possessed, a little aloof, intellectually biased, given to mild banter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;James, 1987, p. 22&quot;&gt;James, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He dressed like a [[dandy]] and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (1987), pp. 10–14&lt;/ref&gt; Orenstein comments that, short in stature,{{#tag:ref|Ravel was 160 centimetres (5ft 3in) tall.&lt;ref name=o111&gt;Orenstein (1991), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} light in frame and bony in features, Ravel had the &quot;appearance of a well-dressed jockey&quot;, whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect.&lt;ref name=o111/&gt; During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century, Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day; from his mid-thirties he was clean-shaven.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, pp. 57 and 106; and Lesure and Nectoux, pp. 15, 16 and 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Les Apaches and Debussy===
Around 1900 Ravel and a number of innovative young artists, poets, critics and musicians joined together in an informal group; they came to be known as [[Les Apaches]] (&quot;The Hooligans&quot;), a name coined by Viñes to represent their status as &quot;artistic outcasts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1991), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War, and members stimulated one another with intellectual argument and performances of their works. The membership of the group was fluid, and at various times included [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Manuel de Falla]] as well as their French friends.{{#tag:ref|Other members were the composers [[Florent Schmitt]], [[Maurice Delage]] and [[Paul Ladmirault]], the poets [[Léon-Paul Fargue]] and [[Tristan Klingsor]], the painter [[Paul Sordes]] and the critic [[Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi|Michel Calvocoressi]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasler, p. 403; Nichols (1977), p. 20; and Orenstein (1991), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy. Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued for more than ten years.&lt;ref name=n101&gt;Nichols (1987), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 [[André Messager]] conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera'' [[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' at the [[Opéra-Comique]]. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] was prominent among those who detested the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Orledge, p. 65 (Dubois); and Donnellon, pp. 8–9 (Saint-Saëns)&lt;/ref&gt; The Apaches were loud in their support.&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Debussy was widely held to be an [[impressionism in music|impressionist]] composer – a label he intensely disliked. Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre.&lt;ref&gt;James, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not.&lt;ref name=k16&gt;Kelly (2000), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Ravel later came to the view that &quot;impressionism&quot; was not a suitable term for any music, and was essentially relevant only to painting.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (2003), p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orenstein, 1991, p. 127&quot;&gt;Orenstein (1991), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel wrote that Debussy's &quot;genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition. For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy{{nbsp}}... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of [his] [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1991), p. 33; and James, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; During the first years of the new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece ''[[Jeux d'eau (Ravel)|Jeux d'eau]]''{{#tag:ref|Literally &quot;Games of water&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;Fountains&quot;|group= n}} (1901), the [[String Quartet (Ravel)|String Quartet]] and the orchestral song cycle ''Shéhérazade'' (both 1903).&lt;ref name=landormy431/&gt; Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works. Nichols calls the quartet &quot;at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2011), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons. Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other. Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom.&lt;ref name=n101/&gt; Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, &quot;Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people.&quot;&lt;ref name=James46/&gt; The public tension led to personal estrangement.&lt;ref name=James46&gt;James, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel said, &quot;It's probably better for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (1987), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift. In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer [[Emma Bardac]]. Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante [[Misia Sert|Misia Edwards]] and the opera star [[Lucienne Bréval]], contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2011), pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first years of the new century Ravel made five attempts to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the [[Prix de Rome]], past winners of which included [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]] and Debussy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article_works/grove/music/40632#S40632.1 &quot;Winners of the Prix de Rome&quot;], ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford University Press, retrieved 27 February 2015 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist [[Paul Landormy]], the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies.&lt;ref name=landormy431&gt;Landormy, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Ravel admitted in 1926 that he had submitted at least one piece deliberately parodying the required conventional form: the cantata ''Myrrha'', which he wrote for the 1901 competition.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, p. 332; and Kelly, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;|group = n}} In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a ''furore''. He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 134; and Duchen, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, [[Charles Lenepveu]], was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (1977), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received.&lt;ref&gt;Woldu, pp. 247 and 249&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'affaire Ravel'' became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those taking a close interest in the controversy was [[Alfred Edwards (journalist)|Alfred Edwards]], owner and editor of ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]'', for which Lalo wrote. Edwards was married to Ravel's friend Misia;{{#tag:ref|The musicologist David Lamaze has suggested that Ravel felt a long-lasting romantic attraction to Misia, and posits that her name is incorporated in Ravel's music in the recurring pattern of the notes E, B, A – &quot;Mi, Si, La&quot; in French [[solfège]].&lt;ref name=lamaze&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7968024.stm &quot;Hidden clue to composer's passion&quot;], BBC, 27 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} the couple took Ravel on a seven-week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905, the first time he had travelled abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2011), pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;

By the latter part of the 1900s Ravel had established a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed.&lt;ref name=rg&gt;Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 607&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nichols 1987, p. 32&quot;&gt;Nichols (1987), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were ''Pavane pour une infante défunte'' (orchestrated 1910), ''[[Miroirs#Structure|Une barque sur l'océan]]'' (1906, from the 1905 piano suite ''[[Miroirs]]''), the Habanera section of ''Rapsodie espagnole'' (1907–08), ''[[Ma mère l'Oye]]'' (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), ''[[Valses nobles et sentimentales (Ravel)|Valses nobles et sentimentales]]'' (1911, orchestrated 1912), ''[[Miroirs#Structure|Alborada del gracioso]]'' (from ''Miroirs'', orchestrated 1918) and ''[[Le tombeau de Couperin]]'' (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; 

[[File:Vaughan-Williams-by-Rothenstein.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|alt=drawing of youngish man with full head of hair, clean shaven, looking towards the artist|[[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], one of Ravel's few pupils]]
Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. [[Manuel Rosenthal]] was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2011), pp. 26–30; and Pollack, pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: &quot;Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Nichols (1987), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; When [[George Gershwin]] asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they &quot;would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|This remark was modified by Hollywood writers for the film ''[[Rhapsody in Blue (film)|Rhapsody in Blue]]'' in 1945, in which Ravel (played by Oscar Loraine) tells Gershwin ([[Robert Alda]]) &quot;If you study with me you'll only write second-rate Ravel instead of first-rate Gershwin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, p. 728&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from &quot;the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner{{nbsp}}... ''Complexe mais pas compliqué'' was his motto.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan Williams, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

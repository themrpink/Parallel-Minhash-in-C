'''Winchester College''' is an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]] [[boarding school]] for boys in the [[public school (UK)|British public school tradition]], situated in [[Winchester]], [[Hampshire]]. It has existed in its present location for over 600 years&lt;!-- and claims the longest unbroken history of any school in [[England]]--&gt;. It is the oldest of the original nine English public schools defined by the [[Clarendon Commission]], seven of which were regulated by the [[Public Schools Act 1868]].

== Official name ==
According to its 1382 charter and final statutes (1400), the school is called in [[Latin]] '''Collegium Sanctae Mariae prope Wintoniam''', or '''Collegium Beatae Mariae Wintoniensis prope Winton''', which translates as '''St Mary's College, near Winchester''', or '''The College of the Blessed Mary of Winchester, near Winchester'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hebron |first1=Malcolm |editor1-last=Foster |editor1-first=Richard |title=50 Treasures from Winchester College. |publisher=SCALA |isbn=9781785512209 |page=55 |chapter=The statutes of Winchester College, 1400|date=30 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Foster |editor1-first=Richard |title=50 Treasures from Winchester College. |date=2019 |publisher=SCALA |isbn=9781785512209}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9,45–47}} It is sometimes referred to by pupils, former pupils and others as &quot;Win: Coll:&quot;, and is more widely known as just &quot;Winchester&quot;.

===Wykehamists===
Current pupils of Winchester College are known as Wykehamists, in memory of the school's founder, William of Wykeham; former pupils are known as [[List of Old Wykehamists|Old Wykehamists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spicer |first=Paul |title=Sir George Dyson: His Life and Music |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNXCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139 |year=2014 |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |isbn=978-1-84383-903-3 |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; or amongst themselves as Old Woks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Michael|title=Slang: The People's Poetry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Xdv4FTyXfkC&amp;pg=PP38|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-998653-8|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Winchester College was founded in 1382  by [[William of Wykeham]], [[Bishop of Winchester]] and Chancellor to both [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] and [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], and the first 70 poor scholars entered the school in 1394.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heritage&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=How has history shaped our school? |url=https://www.winchestercollege.org/explore/heritage |publisher=Winchester College |accessdate=16 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 15th century the specific requirement was that scholars come from families where the income was less than five marks sterling (£3 6s 8d) ''per annum''; in comparison, the contemporary reasonable living for a [[yeoman]] was £5 ''per annum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harwood |first=Winifred A. |title=The Household of Winchester College in the later Middle Ages 1400-1560 |journal=Proceedings of the Hampshire Field Club Archaeological Society |date=2004 |volume=59 |pages=163–179 |url=http://www.hantsfieldclub.org.uk/publications/hampshirestudies/digital/2000s/vol59/Harwood.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded in conjunction with [[New College, Oxford]], for which it was designed to act as a feeder:&lt;ref name=&quot;Heritage&quot;/&gt; the buildings of both colleges were designed by master mason [[William Wynford]]. This double foundation was the model for [[Eton College]] and [[King's College, Cambridge]], some 50 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clutton-Brock |first1=A. |title=Eton |date=1900 |publisher=George Bell and Sons |pages=3-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/eton02clutgoog/page/n20/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--, and for [[Westminster School]], [[Christ Church, Oxford]], and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in Tudor times--&gt;

At first only a small number of pupils other than scholars were admitted; by the 15th century the school had around 100 pupils in total, nominally the 70 scholars, 16 choirboys known as &quot;quiristers&quot;, and the rest &quot;commoners&quot;. Demand for places for commoners was high, and though at first restricted, numbers gradually rose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner 2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner | first=David |title=The Old Boys : the decline and rise of the public school |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-300-18992-6 |pages=2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1860s, ten boarding houses, each for up to sixty pupils, were added, greatly increasing the school's capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Houses: Why is it so important to belong? |url=https://www.winchestercollege.org/living/houses |publisher=Winchester College |accessdate=22 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2020, the number of pupils had risen to 690.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Winchester College |url=https://www.schoolsearch.co.uk/listing/winchester-college-hampshire |website=SchoolSearch.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College==
The seventy [[Scholarship|Scholars]] live in the original buildings, known as '''College'''; an individual scholar is known as a &quot;Collegeman&quot;. College is not usually referred to as a house: hence the terms 'housemaster of College' and 'College house' are not used. The schoolmaster in charge of College is now known as the Master in College, although these duties formerly belonged to the Second Master. The same title, Master in College, is also used by the housemaster of the [[King's Scholar#King's Scholars at Eton College|King's Scholars]] at [[Eton College|Eton]]. The Collegemen wear black gowns, following the founding traditions of the school. Within the school, 'College', without 'the', means both the body of scholars and their buildings; 'Winchester College' and 'the college' refer to the school as a whole. The scholars, called 'Collegemen', enjoy certain privileges compared to the Commoners, such as having open fires and being allowed to walk across Meads, the field outside School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Winchester College |url=https://www.cityofwinchester.co.uk/Education/College/college.html |website=The City of Winchester |accessdate=8 October 2020 |date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every pupil at Winchester, apart from the Scholars, lives in a [[boarding house]], chosen or allocated when applying to Winchester. It is here that he studies, eats and sleeps. Each house is presided over by a housemaster (who takes on the role in addition to teaching duties), assisted by house tutors. Houses compete against each other in school sports. Each house has an official name, usually based on the family name of the first housemaster, which is used mainly as a postal address. Each house also has an informal name, usually based on the name or nickname of an early housemaster. Each house also has a letter, in the order of their founding, to act as an abbreviation, especially on laundry tags. A member of a house is described by the informal name of the house with &quot;-ite&quot; suffixed, as &quot;a Furleyite&quot;, &quot;a Toyeite&quot;, &quot;a Cookite&quot; and so on. College does not have an informal name, although the abbreviation ''Coll'' is sometimes used; its letter is X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Houses |url=https://www.winchestercollege.org/living/houses |publisher=Winchester College |accessdate=8 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admission==

Winchester has its own entrance examination, and does not use [[Common Entrance]] like other major [[Public school (UK)|public schools]]. Those wishing to enter a Commoner House make their arrangements with the relevant housemaster some two years before sitting the exam, usually sitting a test set by the housemaster and an interview. Those applying to College do not take the normal entrance examination but instead sit a separate, harder, exam called &quot;Election&quot;: successful candidates may obtain, according to their performance, a scholarship, an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] or a Headmaster's nomination to join a Commoner House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Timeline for Entry |url=https://www.winchestercollege.org/admissions/13 |publisher=Winchester College |accessdate=8 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to College was historically coupled to remission of fees but this has ceased;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winchestercollege.org/scholarships Scholarships for College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608134650/http://www.winchestercollege.org/scholarships |date=8 June 2010}}. Winchester College. Retrieved on 13 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; instead, [[means-tested]] bursaries of from 5% to 100% of the school fee are provided according to need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bursaries |url=https://www.winchestercollege.org/admissions/bursaries |publisher=Winchester College |accessdate=8 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic structure==

In addition to normal lessons, all boys throughout the school are required to attend a class called Division (known as &quot;Div&quot;) which focuses on parts of history, literature, and politics that do not lead to external examinations; its purpose is to ensure a broad education that does not focus solely on examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Div |url=https://www.winchestercollege.org/learning/div |publisher=Winchester College |accessdate=4 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From year 9, pupils study for at least nine [[GCSE]] and [[IGCSE]]s. Every pupil studies English, mathematics, Latin, French or German, and at least two sciences at this level, as well as &quot;Div&quot;. Pupils then study three [[A-level]]s, &quot;Div&quot;, and an [[Extended Project Qualification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Curriculum |url=https://www.winchestercollege.org/learning/curriculum |publisher=Winchester College |accessdate=8 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==

At Pre-U, 49.3% of grades achieved were D1 or D2, and 86.4% of grades achieved were D1-M1 in 2018. 68.4% of GCSEs were graded A* or equivalent (9 or 8), in comparison to 62.5% in 2017; 92.1% were graded A*/A  or equivalent (9,8 or 7), in comparison to 90.5% in 2017. There were 36 Oxbridge offers; 18 at Oxford and 18 at Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://view.joomag.com/wykeham-journal-2018/0276189001554286560] Retrieved 05 April 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
===Chapel===

File:Winchester_College_Chapel_North_Side_stonework_post_restoration.JPG | North side (after restoration)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Situated on the south side of Chamber Court, the chapel is part of the original college buildings; it retains its original wooden fan-vaulted ceiling, designed by Hugh Herland, carpenter to [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapel&quot;/&gt; 
A striking feature of the chapel is its [[stained glass]]. The East window depicts the stem of Jesse. Down the chapel's north and south sides is a collection of saints. Little of the original medieval glass, designed by [[Thomas Glazier]], survives. A firm of glaziers in Shrewsbury, Betton and Evans, was tasked with cleaning the glass in the 1820s. At that time there was no known process for cleaning the badly deteriorated glass and so it was copied, while most of the original glass was scattered or destroyed. Some pieces have been recovered. The art historian and Old Wykehamist, [[Kenneth Clark]], bought back the Tree of Jesse section of the east window, now housed in Thurburn's Chantry. Further figures &lt;!--bequeathed by Otto von Kienbusch and two more donated by Coleorton Church, Leicestershire {{citation needed}}--&gt; have been returned; they form the east window of Fromond's Chantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapel |url=https://www.winchestercollege.org/explore/location/buildings/chapel |publisher=Winchester College |accessdate=4 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Winchester College Chapel Choir|Chapel Choir]] sings regular services in the chapel, as well as other venues. This consists of  sixteen Quiristers (who attend [[The Pilgrims' School]]) and a similar number of senior boys and a few dons (masters).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapel&quot;/&gt;

===War Cloister===
[[File:Winchester College War Cloister.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Winchester College War Cloister]]
{{main|Winchester College War Cloister}}

Situated to the west of Meads, this cloister serves as a memorial to the Wykehamist dead of the two World Wars. It was designed by [[Herbert Baker]] and dedicated in 1924. It is a listed building.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarCla Historic England&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The War Cloister, Winchester College |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1095486 |publisher=[[Historic England]] |accessdate=4 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A bronze bust of Old Boy [[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding]] sits on the west side of the cloister.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarCla Historic England&quot;/&gt;

The College's South Africa Gate on Kingsgate Street commemorates the Wykehamist dead of the 1899–1902 [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. It leads to the War Cloister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wykehamists- Boer War |url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/49896 |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=7 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another older war memorial in the school is the entry chamber to Chapel, known as &quot;Crimea&quot; after the [[Crimean War]] of 1853–56, and bearing the names of Wykehamists who died at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|siege of Sebastopol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Winchester College Crimea |url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/63315 |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=7 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
=== Notions ===
{{Main|Notions (Winchester College)}}

A ''notion'' is a manner or tradition peculiar to Winchester College. The word notion is also used for words and phrases  used only in the school. An example is &quot;toytime&quot;, meaning prep or homework, from the &quot;toys&quot; or individual cubicles that formerly served as pupils' workspace in the communal chamber or &quot;mugging hall&quot;, from &quot;mug&quot; meaning to work.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, W.H., Hope, J.R. and Cripps, A.H.S., ''Winchester College Notions, by Three Beetleites'': Winchester 1901, pp. 81, 126–127&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fives]] --&gt;

Winchester College has its own game, [[Winchester College football]] (also known as &quot;Win: Co: Fo:&quot; or &quot;Winkies&quot;), played only at Winchester.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkies Independent&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Arcane public school games explained: Anyone for Rugby Fives, The Field Game or Winkies? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools/arcane-public-school-games-explained-anyone-rugby-fives-field-game-or-winkies-9695696.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=29 August 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is played in the spring term with a competition between the school's houses; it is largely managed by the boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sport: Winchester College Football |url=https://www.winchestercollege.org/learning/sport |publisher=Winchester College |accessdate=8 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinctive Winchester version of [[Fives]] resembles [[Rugby Fives]] but with a buttress on the court. The buttress enables a skilful player to cause the ball to ricochet in an unexpected direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Get Active: Why Winchester Fives is better than squash |url=https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/11867466.get-active-why-winchester-fives-is-better-than-squash/ |accessdate=4 October 2020 |work=Southern Daily Echo |date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school has an active [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] club called the Winchester College Boat Club which is based on the [[River Itchen, Hampshire|River Itchen]]. The club is affiliated to [[British Rowing]] (boat code WIN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishrowing.org/club/winchester-college-bc/|title=Club details|website=British Rowing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was twice winner of the [[Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup]] in 1949 and 1954, at the [[Henley Royal Regatta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rowinghistory.net/henley?event=Princess+Elizabeth+Challenge+Cup&amp;competitor= |title=Results |website=Friends of Rowing History |accessdate=8 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined Cadet Force===

Pupils of the school in their second year are currently required to serve in the college's [[Combined Cadet Force]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winchestercollege.org/combined-cadet-force Combined Cadet Force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621021137/http://www.winchestercollege.org/combined-cadet-force |date=21 June 2010 }}. Winchester College. Retrieved on 13 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was founded in 1860 as &quot;The Winchester College Rifle Volunteer Corps&quot; by various boys in their top year as a result of the perceived threat of [[Napoleon III]] after the [[Orsini plot]], and remained entirely autonomous until it was taken over by the Second Master in 1868. It was enrolled as a Cadet Corps in the 1st Hants Volunteer Battalion. In 1908, the Officer Training Corps was established, and by 1914, through the request of the [[War Office]] that Senior Cadets be given appropriate training for the war effort, almost every student became involved in the Corps, though it was never explicitly compulsory. In the Second World War, it was renamed as &quot;The Junior Training Corps&quot;, though its function was still to prepare boys for Officer responsibilities. [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]] remarked on inspecting the Corps in 1946 that there was &quot;latent leadership in all ranks&quot;. In 1948, the &quot;Junior Training Corps&quot; became known as the &quot;Combined Cadet Force&quot; (CCF) which incorporated [[RAF]] and [[Royal Navy|RN]] sections. In 1963, &quot;Alternative Service Activities&quot; were introduced for boys who did not want to join the CCF. Pupils were made eligible to opt out of the CCF at the end of their second year after starting at the beginning of the year: this is still the school's policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winchestercollege.org/UserFiles/pdfs/Armoury.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-17 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716141752/http://www.winchestercollege.org/UserFiles/pdfs/Armoury.pdf |archive-date=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Winchester's Combined Cadet Force received the Queen's Colours, a regimental decoration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winchestercollege.org/winchester-college-combined-cadet-force-celebrates-150-years-of-unbroken-service&lt;/ref&gt;

===School song Domum===
{{distinguish|Dulce Domum}}

The school song is &quot;Domum, Domum, Dulce Domum&quot;, sung at the break-up of the school for the summer holidays. Its origin is unknown; it was described as &quot;an old tradition&quot; in the 1773 ''History and Antiquities of Winchester''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams1878&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Henry Cadwallader |title=Wykehamica: A History of Winchester College and Commoners, from the Foundation to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQkCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PA407 |year=1878 |publisher=J. Parker and Company |pages=407–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- It is mentioned in ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]''. Paradoxically, although the subject of the song is the joy of breaking from the school grind and returning home for the holidays, it is often taken as symbolising the idyllic, nostalgic view of English [[public school (England)|public school]] life in the 19th century.--&gt; 
The traditional tune was composed by [[John Reading (composer and organist)|John Reading]].&lt;ref name=Minstrel&gt;{{cite book |title=The British Minstrel, and Musical and Literary Miscellany: A Selection of Standard Music, Songs, Duets, Glees, Choruses, Etc. and Articles in Musical and General Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RO4sAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA131 |year=1843 |publisher=W. Hamilton |pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new tune, by Malcolm Archer, was officially adopted by the school in about 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Winchester College - The School Song: Domum |website=www.winchestercollege.org |accessdate=2 May 2018 |url=http://www.winchestercollege.org/domum |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930130040/http://www.winchestercollege.org/domum |archive-date=30 September 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, the text was written in the 17th century by a pupil who was confined for misconduct during the [[Whitsun]] holidays.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentleman's Magazine'', 1796, vol. 66, pp. 208–210.&lt;/ref&gt; (In one account, he was tied to a pillar.) It is said that he carved the words on the bark of a tree, which was thereafter called &quot;Domum Tree&quot;, and cast himself into Logie (the river running through the school grounds).&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams1878&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Dickens]], ''All the Year Round'' 29 June 1872 p 160.&lt;/ref&gt; There is still a &quot;Domum Cottage&quot; in that area. The author of the text apparently wrongly treated ''domum'' as a neuter noun.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Townsend Warner, ''Winchester'' (1900) p 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;Domum Dinner&quot; is held at the end of the summer term for leavers. It was formerly restricted to those former scholars of Winchester who were also scholars of New College, and distinguished guests. Until the reforms of the 19th century, there were three successive Election Dinners held during Election Week, culminating in a Domum Ball. Originally these festivities occurred around [[Whitsun]], as suggested by references in the song to early summer such as &quot;See the year, the meadow, smiling&quot; and &quot;Now the swallow seeks her dwelling&quot;.&lt;ref name=Minstrel/&gt;

{{main|The Trusty Servant}}

A 1579 wall-painting  of ''The Trusty Servant'' by the poet [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] hangs outside the college kitchen. It depicts a mythical creature with the body of a man, the head of a pig, its snout closed with a padlock (to keep secrets), the ears of an ass (to hear his master calling), the feet of a stag (for swiftness), and holding working tools in his left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Skull |first1=Joseph |editor1-last=Foster |editor1-first=Richard |title=50 Treasures from Winchester College. |publisher=SCALA |isbn=9781785512209 |page=86 |chapter=Dr Collegio Wintoniensi, 1640s|date=30 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is accompanied by [[allegorical]] verses on the virtues that pupils of the college were supposed to have. The college arms are shown in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Burnett, Mark Thornton | title=Constructing &quot;monsters&quot; in Shakespearean drama and early modern culture | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Trusty Servant|publisher=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

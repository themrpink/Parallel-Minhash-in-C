=== In popular culture ===

The idea of an exotic dancer working as a lethal double agent using her powers of seduction to extract military secrets from her many lovers made Mata Hari an enduring archetype of the [[femme fatale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Samuels|first=Diane|title=The True Life Fiction of Mata Hari|year=2002|publisher=Nick Hern Books|isbn=978-1854596727|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38sRN2MO4NgC&amp;pg=PR15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Feelgood''' are an English [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]] formed in 1971. Hailing from [[Canvey Island]], [[Essex, England|Essex]], the group are best known for early singles such as &quot;[[She Does It Right]]&quot;, &quot;[[Roxette (Dr. Feelgood song)|Roxette]]&quot;, &quot;[[Back in the Night]]&quot; and &quot;[[Milk and Alcohol]]&quot;. The group's original distinctively British [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] sound was centred on [[Wilko Johnson]]'s choppy guitar style. Along with Johnson, the original band line-up included singer [[Lee Brilleaux]] and the [[rhythm section]] of John B. Sparks, known as &quot;Sparko&quot;, on bass guitar&lt;ref name=&quot;sparks&quot;&gt;The spelling is Sparks on all the album credits, but is spelt Sparkes in a few references, and he is also known as &quot;Sparko&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and John Martin, known as &quot;The Big Figure&quot;, on drums.  Although their most commercially productive years were the early to mid-1970s, and in spite of Brilleaux's death in 1994 of [[lymphoma]], a version of the band (featuring none of the original members) continues to tour and record to this day.

==Career==
===Early years===
The band was formed in Canvey Island in 1971 by Johnson, Brilleaux and Sparks, who had all been members of existing R&amp;B bands, and soon added drummer John Martin.  They took their name from a 1962 record by the American [[blues]] pianist and singer [[Piano Red|Willie Perryman]] (also known as &quot;Piano Red&quot;) called &quot;Dr. Feel-Good&quot;, which Perryman recorded under the name of Dr. Feelgood &amp; The Interns. The song was [[cover version|covered]] by several British beat groups in the 1960s, including [[Johnny Kidd &amp; The Pirates]].  The term is also a slang term for heroin or for a doctor who is willing to overprescribe drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Doctor+Feelgood|title=Doctor Feelgood|journal=Segen's Medical Dictionary|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dr-Feelgood mascot stencil FoP-de.jpg|thumb|upright|Dr. Feelgood’s mascot as used by the band in the 1970s and early 1980s.]]
By late 1973, the band's driving R&amp;B had made them one of the most popular bands on the growing London pub rock circuit, and they recorded their debut album, ''[[Down by the Jetty]]'', for [[United Artists Records|United Artists]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dr-feelgood-mn0000204708/biography |title=Dr. Feelgood &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many pub rock acts, Dr. Feelgood were known primarily for their high energy live performances honed through constant touring and regular performances, although their studio albums like ''Down by the Jetty'' and ''[[Malpractice (Dr. Feelgood album)|Malpractice]]'' (1975) were also popular.

Their breakthrough 1976 live album, ''[[Stupidity (Dr. Feelgood album)|Stupidity]]'', reached [[List of number-one albums (UK)|number one]] in the [[UK Albums Chart]] (their only [[chart-topper]]). But after the 1977 follow-up ''[[Sneakin' Suspicion]]'', Johnson left the group because of conflicts with Lee Brilleaux. He was replaced by John 'Gypie' Mayo. With Mayo, the band was never as popular as with Johnson but still enjoyed their only [[Top 40|Top Ten]] hit single in 1979, with &quot;[[Milk and Alcohol]]&quot;. Johnson never achieved any great success outside the band, apart from a brief spell with [[Ian Dury]] and [[The Blockheads]] from 1980. Fans always speculated about a return by Johnson that never occurred.
[[File:S Walwyn.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Guitarist Steve Walwyn in [[Barcelona]], 18 March 2009]]

===Later years===
Despite Mayo's departure in 1981, and various subsequent line-up changes which left Brilleaux the only remaining original member, Dr. Feelgood continued touring and recording through the 1980s.  However, the band then suffered an almost career-finishing blow when Brilleaux died of cancer on 7 April 1994.

As Brilleaux had insisted prior to his death, Dr. Feelgood reunited in May 1995, initially with vocalist [[Pete Gage (singer)|Pete Gage]] (not to be confused with [[Pete Gage (guitarist)|guitarist Pete Gage]] of [[Geno Washington]] and [[Vinegar Joe (band)|Vinegar Joe]]), and recommenced touring in 1996. Though the band contained no original members at this point, the musicians backing Gage had all previously played as members of Dr. Feelgood for at least five years, and in some cases for over a decade. In 1999 Gage was replaced by Robert Kane, formerly of The Animals II and The Alligators, who celebrated his 1,000th gig as the frontman of Dr. Feelgood in April 2007.
[[File:R Kane.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Current vocalist Robert Kane performing in Barcelona, 18 March 2009]]

Every year since Brilleaux's death, a special concert known as the Lee Brilleaux Birthday Memorial has been held on Canvey Island, where former and current Feelgoods have celebrated the music of Dr. Feelgood, and raised money for The Fair Havens Hospice in [[Westcliff-on-Sea]].{{cn|date=July 2019}} Fans attended from all over the globe, and the 20th and final event was held on 9 May 2014. Still based in the UK, Dr. Feelgood continue to play across the world, with concerts in 2010 in Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Switzerland.

Band manager Chris Fenwick organises an annual walk around Canvey to commemorate Brilleaux's life, as well as additional walking tours during which he points out landmarks from the band's career. These include the jetty featured in the photograph on the band's first album cover, and venues where they played early in their career, such as The Lobster Smack inn, The Monico Nightclub and The Canvey Club (disguised as 'The Alibi Club' on the sleeve of the album ''Sneakin' Suspicion'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/12339-dr-feelgood-exhibition-lee-brilleaux-memorial-walk |title=News &amp;#124; Review: Dr Feelgood Exhibition/Lee Brilleaux Memorial Walk |magazine=The Quietus |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A film by [[Julien Temple]] about the early days of the band, ''Oil City Confidential'', premiered at the [[London Film Festival]] on 22 October 2009, and received a standing ovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drfeelgood.org/ |title=Oil City Confidential release |publisher=Drfeelgood.org |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guest of honour was Lee Brilleaux's mother Joan Collinson, along with his widow Shirley and children Kelly and Nick. All the surviving members of the original band were present along with manager Chris Fenwick, former tour manager and [[Stiff Records]] boss [[Jake Riviera]] and other friends and colleagues of the band. The film has its own Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/OilCityConfidential |title=Oil City Confidential - The Dr. Feelgood Story |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reviewing the film for ''The Independent'', Nick Hasted concluded: &quot;Feelgood are remembered in rock history, if at all, as John the Baptists to punk's messiahs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-dr-feelgood-factor-1607929.html |title=The Dr. Feelgood factor - Features - Music |work=[[The Independent]] |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On general release from 1 February 2010, the film was critically well received, with Peter Bradshaw of ''The Guardian'' describing it as &quot;...a vivid study of period, music and place&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Bradshaw |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/04/oil-city-confidential-review |title=Oil City Confidential |work=[[The Guardian]] |date= 4 February 2010|accessdate=2011-11-05 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was first broadcast on [[BBC Four]] in April 2010.

A major exhibition of memorabilia celebrating the band's career ran at The Canvey Club between May and July 2013, having been extended several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everyrecordtellsastory.com/2013/06/07/new-dr-feelgood-exhibition-hits-canvey-island/ |title=New Dr. Feelgood Exhibition Hits Canvey Island « Every record tells a story |publisher=Everyrecordtellsastory.com |date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="6847" xml:space="preserve">A '''Lagged Fibonacci generator''' ('''LFG''' or sometimes '''LFib''') is an example of a [[pseudorandom number generator]]. This class of [[random number generator]] is aimed at being an improvement on the 'standard' [[linear congruential generator]]. These are based on a generalisation of the [[Fibonacci sequence]].

The Fibonacci sequence may be described by the [[recurrence relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the new term is the sum of the last two terms in the sequence. This can be generalised to the sequence:

:&lt;math&gt;S_n \equiv S_{n-j} \star S_{n-k}  \pmod{m},   0 &lt; j &lt; k&lt;/math&gt;

In which case, the new term is some combination of any two previous terms. ''m'' is usually a power of 2 (''m'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''M''&lt;/sup&gt;), often 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; or 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; operator denotes a general [[binary operation]]. This may be either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or the [[bitwise operation|bitwise]] exclusive-or operator ([[XOR]]). The theory of this type of generator is rather complex, and it may not be sufficient simply to choose random values for {{var|j}} and {{var|k}}. These generators also tend to be very sensitive to initialisation.

Generators of this type employ ''k'' words of state (they 'remember' the last ''k'' values).

If the operation used is addition, then the generator is described as an ''Additive Lagged Fibonacci Generator'' or ALFG, if multiplication is used, it is a ''Multiplicative Lagged Fibonacci Generator'' or MLFG, and if the XOR operation is used, it is called a ''Two-tap [[generalised feedback shift register]]'' or GFSR. The [[Mersenne Twister]] algorithm is a variation on a GFSR.  The GFSR is also related to the [[linear-feedback shift register]], or LFSR.

== Properties of lagged Fibonacci generators ==
'''Lagged Fibonacci generators''' have a maximum period of (2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)*2&lt;sup&gt;M-1&lt;/sup&gt; if addition or subtraction is used, and (2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) × ''k'' if exclusive-or operations are used to combine the previous values. If, on the other hand, multiplication is used, the maximum period is (2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) × 2&lt;sup&gt;M−3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 1/4 of period of the additive case.

For the generator to achieve this maximum period, the polynomial:

:''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1

must be [[primitive polynomial (field theory)|primitive]] over the integers mod 2. Values of j and k satisfying this constraint have been published in the literature. Popular pairs are:

:{j = 7, k = 10},  {j = 5, k = 17},  {j = 24, k = 55},  {j = 65, k = 71},  {j = 128, k = 159}  [https://web.archive.org/web/20040309175607/http://www.ccs.uky.edu/csep/RN/RN.html], {j = 6, k = 31}, {j = 31, k = 63}, {j = 97, k = 127}, {j = 353, k = 521}, {j = 168, k = 521}, {j = 334, k = 607}, {j = 273, k = 607}, {j = 418, k = 1279} [http://www.nersc.gov/nusers/resources/software/libs/math/random/www2.0/DOCS/www/parameters.html]

Another list of possible values for ''j'' and ''k'' is on page 29 of volume 2 of ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'':

:(24, 55), (38, 89), (37, 100), (30, 127), (83, 258), (107, 378), (273, 607), (1029, 2281), (576, 3217), (4187, 9689), (7083, 19937), (9739, 23209)

Note that the smaller number have short periods (only a few &quot;random&quot; numbers are generated before the first &quot;random&quot; number is repeated and the sequence restarts).

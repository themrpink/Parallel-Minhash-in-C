[[Karaindash]] strengthened diplomatic ties with the Assyrian king [[Ashur-bel-nisheshu]] and the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] and protected Babylonian borders with Elam.

[[Kadašman-Ḫarbe I]] succeeded Karaindash, and briefly invaded Elam before being eventually defeated and ejected by its king [[Tepti Ahar]]. He then had to contend with the [[Suteans]], [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] from the southeastern Levant who invaded Babylonia and sacked Uruk. He describes having &quot;annihilated their extensive forces&quot;, then constructed fortresses in a mountain region called [[Ḫiḫi]], in the desert to the west (modern [[Syria]]) as security outposts, and &quot;he dug wells and settled people on fertile lands, to strengthen the guard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Babylonians |author=H. W. F. Saggs |publisher=British Museum Press |year=2000 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kurigalzu I]] succeeded the throne, and soon came into conflict with Elam, to the east. When [[Ḫur-batila]], the successor of Tepti Ahar took the throne of Elam, he began raiding the Babylonia, taunting Kurigalzu to do battle with him at [[Dūr-Šulgi]]. Kurigalzu launched a campaign which resulted in the abject defeat and capture of Ḫur-batila, who appears in no other inscriptions. He went on to conquer the eastern lands of Elam. This took his army to the Elamite capital, the city of Susa, which was sacked. After this a puppet ruler was placed on the Elamite throne, subject to Babylonia. Kurigalzu I maintained friendly relations with Assyria, [[Egypt]] and the Hittites throughout his reign. [[Kadashman-Enlil I]] (1374–1360 BC) succeeded him, and continued his diplomatic policies.

[[Burna-Buriash II]] ascended to the throne in 1359 BC, he retained friendly relations with Egypt, but the resurgent [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1050 BC) to the north was now encroaching into northern Babylonia, and as a symbol of peace, the Babylonian king took the daughter of the powerful Assyrian king [[Ashur-uballit I]] in marriage. He also maintained friendly relations with [[Suppiluliuma I]], ruler of the Hittite Empire.

He was succeeded by [[Kara-hardash|Kara-ḫardaš]] (who was half Assyrian, and the grandson of the Assyrian king) in 1333 BC, a usurper named [[Nazi-Bugash|Nazi-Bugaš]] deposed him, enraging [[Ashur-uballit I]], who invaded and sacked Babylon, slew Nazi-Bugaš, annexed Babylonian territory for the Middle Assyrian Empire, and installed [[Kurigalzu II]] (1345–1324 BC) as his vassal ruler of Babylonia.

Soon after [[Arik-den-ili]] succeeded the throne of Assyria in 1327 BC, Kurigalzu III attacked Assyria in an attempt to reassert Babylonian power. After some impressive initial successes he was ultimately defeated, and lost yet more territory to Assyria. Between 1307 BC and 1232 BC his successors, such as [[Nazi-Maruttash]], [[Kadashman-Turgu]], [[Kadashman-Enlil II]], [[Kudur-Enlil]] and [[Shagarakti-Shuriash]], allied with the empires of the Hittites and the [[Mitanni]], (who were both also losing swathes of territory to the resurgent Assyrians). in a failed attempt to stop Assyrian expansion, which nevertheless continued unchecked.

[[Kashtiliash IV]]'s (1242–1235 BC) reign ended catastrophically as the Assyrian king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1243–1207 BC) routed his armies, sacked and burned Babylon and set himself up as king, ironically becoming the first ''native'' Mesopotamian to rule the state, its previous rulers having all been ''non-Mesopotamian'' Amorites and Kassites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq&quot; /&gt; Kashtiliash himself was taken to Ashur as a prisoner of war.

An Assyrian governor/king named [[Enlil-nadin-shumi]] was placed on the throne to rule as viceroy to Tukulti-Ninurta I, and [[Kadashman-Harbe II]] and [[Adad-shuma-iddina]] succeeded as Assyrian governor/kings, subject to Tukulti-Ninurta I until 1216 BC.

Babylon did not begin to recover until late in the reign of [[Adad-shuma-usur]] (1216–1189 BC), as he too remained a vassal of Assyria until 1193 BC. However, he was able to prevent the Assyrian king [[Enlil-kudurri-usur]] from retaking Babylonia, which, apart from its northern reaches, had mostly shrugged off Assyrian domination during a short period of civil war in the Assyrian empire, in the years after the death of Tukulti-Ninurta.

[[Meli-Shipak II]] (1188–1172 BC) seems to have had a peaceful reign. Despite not being able to regain northern Babylonia from Assyria, no further territory was lost, Elam did not threaten, and the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] now affecting the Levant, [[Canaan]], [[Egypt]], the [[Caucasus]], Anatolia, [[Mediterranean]], [[North Africa]], northern Iran and [[Balkans]] seemed (initially) to have little impact on Babylonia (or indeed Assyria and Elam).

War resumed under subsequent kings such as [[Marduk-apla-iddina I]] (1171–1159 BC) and [[Zababa-shuma-iddin]] (1158 BC). The long reigning Assyrian king [[Ashur-dan I]] (1179–1133 BC) resumed expansionist policies and conquered further parts of northern Babylonia from both kings, and the Elamite ruler [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]] eventually conquered most of eastern Babylonia. [[Enlil-nadin-ahhe]] (1157–1155 BC) was finally overthrown and the Kassite dynasty ended after Ashur-dan I conquered yet more of northern and central Babylonia, and the equally powerful Shutruk-Nahhunte pushed deep into the heart of Babylonia itself, sacking the city and slaying the king. Poetical works have been found lamenting this disaster.

Despite the loss of territory, general military weakness, and evident reduction in literacy and culture, the Kassite dynasty was the longest-lived dynasty of Babylon, lasting until 1155 BC, when Babylon was conquered by Shutruk-Nakhunte of Elam, and reconquered a few years later by the [[Nebuchadnezzar I]], part of the larger Late Bronze Age collapse.

===Early Iron Age – Native rule, second dynasty of Isin, 1155–1026 BC===
The Elamites did not remain in control of Babylonia long, instead entering into an ultimately unsuccessful war with Assyria, allowing [[Marduk-kabit-ahheshu]] (1155–1139 BC) to establish the [[Fourth Dynasty of Babylon|Dynasty IV of Babylon, from Isin]], with the very first native Akkadian-speaking south Mesopotamian dynasty to rule Babylonia, with Marduk-kabit-ahheshu becoming only the second native Mesopotamian to sit on the throne of Babylon, after the Assyrian king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]]. His dynasty was to remain in power for some 125 years. The new king successfully drove out the Elamites and prevented any possible Kassite revival. Later in his reign he went to war with Assyria, and had some initial success, briefly capturing the south Assyrian city of [[Ekallatum]] before ultimately suffering defeat at the hands of [[Ashur-Dan I]].

[[Itti-Marduk-balatu]] succeeded his father in 1138 BC, and successfully repelled Elamite attacks on Babylonia during his 8-year reign. He too made attempts to attack Assyria, but also met with failure at the hands of the still reigning Ashur-Dan I.

[[Ninurta-nadin-shumi]] took the throne in 1137 BC, and also attempted an invasion of Assyria, his armies seem to have skirted through eastern [[Aramea]] (modern Syria) and then made an attempt to attack the Assyrian city of Arbela (modern [[Erbil]]) from the west. However, this bold move met with defeat at the hands of [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] who then forced a treaty in his favour upon the Babylonian king.

[[Nebuchadnezzar I]] (1124–1103 BC) was the most famous ruler of this dynasty. He fought and defeated the Elamites and drove them from Babylonian territory, invading Elam itself, sacking the Elamite capital Susa, and recovering the sacred statue of Marduk that had been carried off from Babylon during the fall of the Kassites. Shortly afterwards, the king of Elam was assassinated and his kingdom disintegrated into civil war. However, Nebuchadnezzar failed to extend Babylonian territory further, being defeated a number of times by [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] (1133–1115 BC), king of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], for control of formerly Hittite-controlled territories in [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] and Anatolia. The Hittite Empire of the northern and western Levant and eastern Anatolia had been largely annexed by the Middle Assyrian Empire, and its heartland finally overrun by invading [[Phrygians]] from the [[Balkans]]. In the later years of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar I devoted himself to peaceful building projects and securing Babylonia's borders against the Assyrians, Elamites and Arameans.

Nebuchadnezzar was succeeded by his two sons, firstly [[Enlil-nadin-apli]] (1103–1100), who lost territory to Assyria. The second of them, [[Marduk-nadin-ahhe]] (1098–1081 BC) also went to war with Assyria. Some initial success in these conflicts gave way to a catastrophic defeat at the hands of the powerful Assyrian king [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115–1076 BC), who annexed huge swathes of Babylonian territory, thus further expanding the Assyrian Empire. Following this a terrible famine gripped Babylon, inviting attacks and migrations from the northwest Semitic tribes of [[Aramaeans]] and [[Suteans]] from the Levant.

In 1072 BC [[Marduk-shapik-zeri]] signed a peace treaty with [[Ashur-bel-kala]] (1075–1056 BC) of Assyria, however, his successor [[Kadašman-Buriaš]] was not so friendly to Assyria, prompting the Assyrian king to invade Babylonia and depose him, placing [[Adad-apla-iddina]] on the throne as his vassal. Assyrian domination continued until c. 1050 BC, with [[Marduk-ahhe-eriba]] and [[Marduk-zer-X]] regarded as vassals of Assyria. After 1050 BC the Middle Assyrian Empire descended into a period of civil war, followed by constant warfare with the [[Arameans]], [[Phrygians]], [[Neo-Hittite states]] and Hurrians, allowing Babylonia to once more largely free itself from the Assyrian yoke for a few decades.

However, [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic-speaking]] Babylonia soon began to suffer further repeated incursions from [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] nomadic peoples migrating from the Levant during the [[Bronze Age collapse]], and during the 11th century BC large swathes of the Babylonian countryside was appropriated and occupied by these newly arrived [[Arameans]] and [[Suteans]]. Arameans settled much of the countryside in eastern and central Babylonia and the Suteans in the western deserts, with the weak Babylonian kings being unable to stem these migrations.

===Period of chaos, 1026–911 BC===
The ruling Babylonian dynasty of [[Nabu-shum-libur]] was deposed by marauding Arameans in 1026 BC, and the heart of Babylonia, including the capital city itself descended into anarchic state, and no king was to rule Babylon for over 20 years.

However, in southern Mesopotamia (a region corresponding with the old Dynasty of the Sealand), Dynasty V (1025–1004 BC) arose, this was ruled by [[Simbar-shipak]], leader of a Kassite clan, and was in effect a separate state from Babylon. The state of anarchy allowed the Assyrian ruler [[Ashur-nirari IV]] (1019–1013 BC) the opportunity to attack Babylonia in 1018 BC, and he invaded and captured the Babylonian city of Atlila and some northern regions for Assyria.

The south Mesopotamian dynasty was replaced by another Kassite Dynasty (Dynasty VI; 1003–984 BC) which also seems to have regained control over Babylon itself. The Elamites deposed this brief Kassite revival, with king [[Mar-biti-apla-usur]] founding Dynasty VII (984–977 BC). However, this dynasty too fell, when the Arameans once more ravaged Babylon.

Babylonian rule was restored by [[Nabû-mukin-apli]] in 977 BC, ushering in Dynasty VIII. Dynasty IX begins with [[Ninurta-kudurri-usur II]], who ruled from 941 BC. Babylonia remained weak during this period, with whole areas of Babylonia now under firm Aramean and Sutean control. Babylonian rulers were often forced to bow to pressure from Assyria and Elam, both of which had appropriated Babylonian territory.

===Assyrian rule, 911–619 BC===
Babylonia remained in a state of chaos as the 10th century BC drew to a close. A further migration of nomads from the Levant occurred in the early 9th century BC with the arrival of the [[Chaldea]]ns, another nomadic northwest Semitic people described in Assyrian annals as the &quot;Kaldu&quot;. The Chaldeans settled in the far southeast of Babylonia, joining the already long extant Arameans and Suteans. By 850 BC the migrant Chaldeans had established their own land in the extreme southeast of Mesopotamia.

From 911 BC with the founding of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC) by [[Adad-nirari II]], Babylon found itself once again under the domination and rule of its fellow Mesopotamian state for the next three centuries. Adad-nirari II twice attacked and defeated [[Shamash-mudammiq]] of Babylonia, annexing a large area of land north of the [[Diyala River]] and the towns of [[Hīt]] and [[Zanqu]] in mid Mesopotamia. He made further gains over Babylonia under [[Nabu-shuma-ukin I]] later in his reign. [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] and [[Ashurnasirpal II]] also forced Babylonia into vassalage, and [[Shalmaneser III]] (859–824 BC) sacked Babylon itself, slew king [[Nabu-apla-iddina]], subjugated the Aramean, Sutean and Chaldean tribes settled within Babylonia, and installed [[Marduk-zakir-shumi I]] (855–819 BC) followed by [[Marduk-balassu-iqbi]] (819–813 BC) as his vassals. It was during the late 850's BC, in the annals of [[Shalmaneser III]], that the [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Arabs]] are first mentioned in the pages of written recorded history.

Upon the death of Shalmaneser II, [[Baba-aha-iddina]] was reduced to vassalage by the Assyrian queen [[Shammuramat]] (known as [[Semiramis]] to the Persians, Armenians and Greeks), acting as regent to his successor [[Adad-nirari III]] who was merely a boy. Adad-nirari III eventually killed Baba-aha-iddina and ruled there directly until 800 BC until [[Ninurta-apla-X]] was crowned. However, he too was subjugated by Adad-Nirari II. The next Assyrian king, [[Shamshi-Adad V]] then made a vassal of [[Marduk-bel-zeri]].

Babylonia briefly fell to another foreign ruler when [[Marduk-apla-usur]] ascended the throne in 780 BC, taking advantage of a period of civil war in Assyria. He was a member of the [[Chaldea]]n tribe who had a century or so earlier settled in a small region in the far southeastern corner of Mesopotamia, bordering the [[Persian Gulf]] and southwestern Elam. [[Shalmaneser IV]] attacked him and retook northern Babylonia, forcing a border treaty in Assyria's favour upon him. However, he was allowed to remain on the throne, and successfully stabilised the part of Babylonia he controlled. [[Eriba-Marduk]], another Chaldean, succeeded him in 769 BC and his son, [[Nabu-shuma-ishkun]] in 761 BC. Babylonia appears to have been in a state of chaos during this time, with the north occupied by Assyria, its throne occupied by foreign Chaldeans, and civil unrest prominent throughout the land.

The Babylonian king [[Nabonassar]] overthrew the Chaldean usurpers in 748 BC, and successfully stabilised Babylonia, remaining untroubled by [[Ashur-nirari V]] of Assyria. However, with the accession of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (745–727 BC) Babylonia came under renewed attack. Babylon was invaded and sacked and Nabonassar reduced to vassalage. His successors [[Nabu-nadin-zeri]], [[Nabu-suma-ukin II]] and [[Nabu-mukin-zeri]] were also in servitude to Tiglath-Pileser III, until in 729 BC the Assyrian king decided to rule Babylon directly as its king instead of allowing Babylonian kings to remain as vassals of Assyria as his predecessors had done for two hundred years.

It was during this period that [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic]] was introduced by the Assyrians as the [[lingua franca]] of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and Mesopotamian Aramaic began to supplant Akkadian as the spoken language of the general populace of both Assyria and Babylonia.

The Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser V]] was declared king of Babylon in 727 BC, but died whilst besieging [[Samaria]] in 722 BC.

Revolt was then fomented against Assyrian domination by [[Marduk-apla-iddina II]], a Chaldean malka (chieftain) of the far southeast of Mesopotamia, with strong Elamite support. Marduk-apla-iddina managed to take the throne of Babylon itself between 721–710 BC whilst the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] (722–705 BC) were otherwise occupied in defeating the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] who had attacked Assyria's Persian and Median vassal colonies in ancient Iran. Marduk-apla-iddina II was eventually defeated and ejected by [[Sargon II]] of Assyria, and fled to his protectors in Elam. [[Sargon II]] was then declared king in Babylon.

====Destruction of Babylon====
[[Sennacherib]] (705–681 BC) succeeded Sargon II, and after ruling directly for a while, he placed his son [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]] on the throne. However, Merodach-Baladan and his Elamite protectors continued to unsuccessfully agitate against Assyrian rule. [[Nergal-ushezib]], an Elamite, murdered the Assyrian prince and briefly took the throne. This led to the infuriated Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] invading and subjugating Elam and sacking Babylon, laying waste to and largely destroying the city. Sennacherib was soon murdered by his own sons while praying to the god [[Nisroch]] in [[Nineveh]] in 681 BC. A puppet king [[Marduk-zakir-shumi II]] was placed on the throne by the new Assyrian king [[Esarhaddon]]. However, Marduk-apla-iddina returned from exile in Elam, and briefly deposed him, forcing Esarhaddon to attack and defeat him, whereupon he once more fled to his masters in Elam, where he died in exile.

====Restoration and rebuilding====
[[Esarhaddon]] (681–669 BC) ruled Babylon personally, he completely rebuilt the city, bringing rejuvenation and peace to the region. Upon his death, and in an effort to maintain harmony within his vast empire (which stretched from the Caucasus to Egypt and [[Nubia]] and from [[Cyprus]] to Iran), he installed his eldest son [[Shamash-shum-ukin]] as a subject king in Babylon, and his youngest, the highly educated [[Ashurbanipal]] (669–627 BC), in the more senior position as king of Assyria and overlord of Shamash-shum-ukin.

====Babylonian revolt====
[[File:Babylonian prisoners under Assyrian guard, reign of Ashurbanipal 668-630 BCE, Nineveh, ME 124788.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Babylonian prisoners under the surveillance of an Assyrian guard, reign of Ashurbanipal 668-630 BCE, Nineveh, [[British Museum]] ME 124788]]
Despite being an Assyrian himself, Shamash-shum-ukin, after decades subject to his brother [[Ashurbanipal]], declared that the city of Babylon (and not the Assyrian city of [[Nineveh]])  should be the seat of the immense empire. He raised a major revolt against his brother, Ashurbanipal. He led a powerful coalition of peoples also resentful of Assyrian subjugation and rule, including Elam, the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Medes]], the Babylonians, Chaldeans and Suteans of southern Mesopotamia, the Arameans of the Levant and southwest Mesopotamia, the [[Arabs]] and [[Dilmun]]ites of the Arabian Peninsula and the Canaanites-Phoenicians. After a bitter struggle Babylon was sacked and its allies vanquished, Shamash-shum-ukim being killed in the process. Elam was destroyed once and for all, and the Babylonians, Persians, Chaldeans, Arabs, Medes, Elamites, Arameans, Suteans and Canaanites were violently subjugated, with Assyrian troops exacting savage revenge on the rebelling peoples. An Assyrian governor named [[Kandalanu]] was placed on the throne to rule on behalf of the Assyrian king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq&quot;/&gt; Upon Ashurbanipal's death in 627 BC, his son [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] (627–623 BC) became ruler of Babylon and Assyria.

However, Assyria soon descended into a series of brutal internal civil wars which were to cause its downfall. Ashur-etil-ilani was deposed by one of his own generals, named [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] in 623 BC, who also set himself up as king in Babylon. After only one year on the throne amidst continual civil war, [[Sinsharishkun]] (622–612 BC) ousted him as ruler of Assyria and Babylonia in 622 BC. However, he too was beset by constant unremitting civil war in the Assyrian heartland. Babylonia took advantage of this and rebelled under [[Nabopolassar]], a previously unknown ''malka'' (chieftain) of the Chaldeans, who had settled in southeastern Mesopotamia by c. 850 BC.

It was during the reign of Sin-shar-ishkun that Assyria's vast empire began to unravel, and many of its former subject peoples ceased to pay tribute, most significantly for the Assyrians; the Babylonians, Chaldeans, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]], Arameans and [[Cimmerians]].

===Neo-Babylonian Empire (Chaldean Empire)===
{{Main|Neo-Babylonian Empire|Chaldea}}
[[File:Empire neo babylonien.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]]]
[[File:Panorama view of the reconstructed Southern Palace of Nebuchadnezzar II, 6th century BC, Babylon, Iraq.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Panorama view of the reconstructed Southern Palace of Nebuchadnezzar II, 6th century BC, Babylon, Iraq]]
In 620 BC Nabopolassar seized control over much of Babylonia with the support of most of the inhabitants, with only the city of Nippur and some northern regions showing any loyalty to the beleaguered Assyrian king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq&quot; /&gt; Nabopolassar was unable to utterly secure Babylonia, and for the next four years he was forced to contend with an occupying Assyrian army encamped in Babylonia trying to unseat him. However, the Assyrian king, Sin-shar-ishkun was plagued by constant revolts among his people in [[Nineveh]], and was thus prevented from ejecting Nabopolassar.

The stalemate ended in 615 BC, when Nabopolassar entered the Babylonians and Chaldeans into alliance with [[Cyaxares]], an erstwhile vassal of Assyria, and king of the [[Iranian peoples]]; the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Sagartians]] and [[Parthia]]ns. Cyaxares had also taken advantage of the Assyrian destruction of the formerly regionally dominant pre-Iranian Elamite and [[Mannean]] nations and the subsequent anarchy in Assyria to free the [[Iranic]] peoples from three centuries of the Assyrian yoke and regional Elamite domination. The [[Scythians]] from north of the [[Caucasus]], and the [[Cimmerians]] from the [[Black Sea]] who had both also been subjugated by Assyria, joined the alliance, as did regional Aramean tribes.

In 615 BC, while the Assyrian king was fully occupied fighting rebels in both Babylonia and Assyria itself, Cyaxares launched a surprise attack on the Assyrian heartlands, sacking the cities of [[Kalhu]] (the Biblical [[Calah]], [[Nimrud]]) and [[Arrapkha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]), Nabopolassar was still pinned down in southern Mesopotamia and thus not involved in this breakthrough.

From this point on the coalition of Babylonians, Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, Scythians, Cimmerians and Sagartians fought in unison against a civil war ravaged Assyria. Major Assyrian cities such as Ashur, Arbela (modern [[Irbil]]), [[Guzana]], [[Dur Sharrukin]] (modern [[Khorsabad]]), [[Imgur-Enlil]], [[Nibarti-Ashur]], [[Gasur]], [[Kanesh]], [[Kar Ashurnasipal]] and [[Tushhan]] fell to the alliance during 614 BC. Sin-shar-ishkun somehow managed to rally against the odds during 613 BC, and drove back the combined forces ranged against him.

However, the alliance launched a renewed combined attack the following year, and after five years of fierce fighting [[Nineveh]] was sacked in late 612 BC after a prolonged siege, in which Sin-shar-ishkun was killed defending his capital.

House to house fighting continued in Nineveh, and an Assyrian general and member of the royal household, took the throne as [[Ashur-uballit II]] (612–605 BC). He was offered the chance of accepting a position of vassalage by the leaders of the alliance according to the [[Babylonian Chronicle]]. However, he refused and managed to successfully fight his way out of Nineveh and to the northern Assyrian city of [[Harran]] in [[Upper Mesopotamia]] where he founded a new capital. The fighting continued, as the Assyrian king held out against the alliance until 607 BC, when he was eventually ejected by the Medes, Babylonians, Scythians and their allies, and prevented in an attempt to regain the city the same year.

[[File:Nabonidus.jpg|thumb|Stele of [[Nabonidus]] exhibited in the British Museum. The king is shown praying to the [[Moon]], the [[Sun]] and [[Venus]] and is depicted as being the closest to the Moon.]]
The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] Pharaoh [[Necho II]], whose dynasty had been installed as vassals of Assyria in 671 BC, belatedly tried to aid Egypt's former Assyrian masters, possibly out of fear that Egypt would be next to succumb to the new powers without Assyria to protect them, having already been ravaged by the [[Scythians]]. The Assyrians fought on with Egyptian aid until what was probably a final decisive victory was achieved against them at [[Carchemish]] in northwestern Assyria in 605 BC. The seat of empire was thus transferred to Babylonia{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=105}} for the first time since Hammurabi over a thousand years before.

Nabopolassar was followed by his son [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] (605–562 BC), whose reign of 43 years made Babylon once more the ruler of much of the civilized world, taking over portions of the former Assyrian Empire, with the eastern and northeastern portion being taken by the Medes and the far north by the [[Scythians]].{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=105}}

Nebuchadnezzar II may have also had to contend with remnants of the Assyrian resistance. Some sections of the Assyrian army and administration may have still continued in and around [[Dur-Katlimmu]] in northwest Assyria for a time, however, by 599 BC Assyrian imperial records from this region also fell silent. The fate of Ashur-uballit II remains unknown, and he may have been killed attempting to regain Harran, at Carchemish, or continued to fight on, eventually disappearing into obscurity.

The [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], erstwhile allies of Babylonia under Nabopolassar, now became a threat, and Nebuchadnezzar II was forced to march into Anatolia and rout their forces, ending the northern threat to his Empire.

The Egyptians attempted to remain in the Near East, possibly in an effort to aid in restoring Assyria as a secure buffer against Babylonia and the Medes and Persians, or to carve out an empire of their own. Nebuchadnezzar II campaigned against the Egyptians and drove them back over the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. However, an attempt to take Egypt itself as his Assyrian predecessors had succeeded in doing failed, mainly due to a series of rebellions from the [[Israelite]]s of  [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and  the former kingdom of [[Israel (northern Kingdom)|Ephraim]], the [[Phoenicians]] of [[Caanan]] and the [[Arameans]] of the Levant. The Babylonian king crushed these rebellions, deposed [[Jehoiakim]], the king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and deported a sizeable part of the population to Babylonia. Cities like [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]] and [[Damascus]] were also subjugated. The [[Arabs]] and other South Arabian peoples who dwelt in the deserts to the south of the borders of Mesopotamia were then also subjugated.

In 567 BC he went to war with Pharaoh [[Amasis II|Amasis]], and briefly invaded [[Egypt]] itself. After securing his empire, which included marrying a Median princess, he devoted himself to maintaining the empire and conducting numerous impressive building projects in Babylon. He is credited with building the fabled [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Wide Sechool |work=History of Phoenicia&amp;nbsp;– Part IV |url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/ancient/HistoryofPhoenicia/chap22.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918143341/http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/ancient/HistoryofPhoenicia/chap22.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-18 |accessdate=2007-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amel-Marduk]] succeeded to the throne and reigned for only two years. Little contemporary record of his rule survives, though [[Berossus|Berosus]] later stated that he was deposed and murdered in 560 BC by his successor [[Neriglissar]] for conducting himself in an &quot;improper manner&quot;.

[[Neriglissar]] (560–556 BC) also had a short reign. He was the son in law of Nebuchadnezzar II, and it is unclear if he was a Chaldean or native Babylonian who married into the dynasty. He campaigned in Aram and Phoenicia, successfully maintaining Babylonian rule in these regions. Neriglissar died young however, and was succeeded by his son [[Labashi-Marduk]] (556 BC), who was still a boy. He was deposed and killed during the same year in a palace conspiracy.

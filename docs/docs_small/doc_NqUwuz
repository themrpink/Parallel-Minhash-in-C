[[File:SirJMurrayatwork.jpg|thumb|upright|right|250px|[[John Murray (oceanographer)|Dr. John Murray]] was the driving force behind the renewal of interest in Antarctic exploration at the beginning of the 20th century.]]
The initial impetus for the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration was a lecture given by [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Dr. John Murray]] entitled &quot;The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration&quot;, given to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in London, 27 November 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= John|last= Murray|title= The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration|publisher= The Geographical Journal, Vol. 3, No. 1|year= 1894|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray advocated that research into the Antarctic should be organised to &quot;resolve the outstanding geographical questions still posed in the south&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Crane|first= David|title= Scott of the Antarctic: A Life of Courage, and Tragedy in the Extreme South|publisher= Harper Collins|year= 2005|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-715068-7|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Royal Geographical Society instated an Antarctic Committee shortly prior to this, in 1887, which successfully encouraged many whalers to explore the Southern regions of the world and laid the groundwork for the lecture given by Murray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= American Association for the Advancement of Science |title= The Exploration of the Antarctic Regions|publisher= Science, Vol. 9, No. 223|year= 1887|location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian [[Antarctic (ship)|ship ''Antarctic'']] was put ashore at [[Cape Adare]], on 24 January 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fnbl.snl.no%2FHenrik_Bull_-_2&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url|title=Henrik Bull}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] was led by [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Adrian de Gerlache]]. In 1898, they became the first men to spend winter on Antarctica, when their ship ''[[RV Belgica (1884)|Belgica]]'' became trapped in the ice. They became stuck on 28 February 1898, and only managed to get out of the ice on 14 March 1899.

During their forced stay, several men lost their sanity, not only because of the Antarctic winter night and the endured hardship, but also because of the language problems between the different nationalities. This was the first expedition to [[overwinter]] within the [[Antarctic Circle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Antarctic Explorers&amp;nbsp;– Adrien de Gerlache|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000083.htm|publisher= South-pole.com|access-date=22 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = HuntfordLastPlace&gt;Huntford (''Last Place on Earth'') pp. 64–75&lt;/ref&gt; and they visited the [[South Shetland Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sg49AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=first%20landing&amp;pg=PA221|author=R.

===Early British expeditions===
[[File:Discoveryboat.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''[[RRS Discovery]]'' carried an [[Discovery Expedition|expedition]] led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] in 1901.]]
The [[Southern Cross Expedition]] began in 1898 and lasted for two years. This was the first expedition to overwinter on the Antarctic mainland ([[Cape Adare]]) and was the first to make use of dogs and sledges. It made the first ascent of The [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]], (The Great Ice Barrier later became formally known as the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]). The expedition set a [[Farthest South]] record at 78°30'S. It also calculated the location of the [[South Magnetic Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Forgotten Expedition|url= http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/english/forgotten%2Dexpedition/|publisher= Antarctic Heritage Trust|access-date= 13 August 2008|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091120185702/http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/english/forgotten-expedition/|archive-date= 20 November 2009|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Borchgrevink, Carsten Egeberg (1864–1934)|url= http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070353b.htm|publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography Online Edition|access-date=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Discovery Expedition]] was then launched, from 1901–04 and was led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]]. It made the first ascent of the Western Mountains in [[Victoria Land]], and discovered the polar plateau. Its southern journey set a new Farthest South record, 82°17'S. Many other geographical features were discovered, mapped and named. This was the first of several expeditions based in [[McMurdo Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, pp. 57–79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 253 (map); pp. 294–95 (maps)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fiennes, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, the [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]] was launched, headed by [[William Speirs Bruce]]. '[[Orcadas Base|Ormond House]]' was established as a [[Meteorology|meteorological]] observatory on [[Laurie Island]] in the [[South Orkney Islands|South Orkneys]] and was the first permanent base in Antarctica. The [[Weddell Sea]] was penetrated to 74°01'S, and the coastline of [[Coats Land]] was discovered, defining the sea's eastern limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Scotland and the Antarctic, Section 5: The Voyage of the ''Scotia''|url= http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/scotia/gooant/gooant05.htm|publisher= Glasgow Digital Library|access-date=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Speak, pp. 82–95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000093.htm |title=William S.

[[Ernest Shackleton]], who had been a member of Scott's expedition, organized and led the [[Nimrod Expedition]] from 1907 to 1909. The expedition's primary objective was of reaching the South Pole. Based in [[McMurdo Sound]], the expedition pioneered the [[Beardmore Glacier]] route to the [[South Pole]], and the (limited) use of motorised transport. Its southern march reached 88°23'S, a new Farthest South record 97 [[nautical miles|geographical miles]] from the Pole before having to turn back. During the expedition, Shackleton was the first to reach the polar plateau. Parties led by [[T. W. Edgeworth David]] also became the first to climb [[Mount Erebus]] and to reach the [[South Magnetic Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Scotland and the Antarctic, Section 3: Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen|url= http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/scotia/gooant/gooant030202.htm|publisher= Glasgow Digital Library|access-date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riffenburgh, pp. 309–12 (summary of achievements)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huntford (''Shackleton'' biography) p. 242 (map)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expeditions from other countries===
[[File:Erich dagobert von drygalski.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Erich von Drygalski]] led the [[Gauss Expedition|First German Antarctic Expedition]] in 1901.]]
The [[Gauss Expedition|First German Antarctic Expedition]] was sent to investigate eastern Antarctica in 1901. It discovered the coast of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II Land]], and [[Gaussberg|Mount Gauss]]. The expedition's [[Gauss (ship)|ship]] became trapped in ice, however, which prevented more extensive exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Erich von Drygalski 1865–1949|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000085.htm|publisher = South-pole.com|access-date=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mill, pp. 420–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swedish Antarctic Expedition]], operating at the same time worked in the east coastal area of [[Graham Land]], and was marooned on [[Snow Hill Island]] and [[Paulet Island]] in the [[Weddell Sea]], after the sinking of its expedition ship. It was rescued by the Argentinian naval vessel ''Uruguay''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Goodlad|first= James A.|title= Scotland and the Antarctic, Section II: Antarctic Exploration|url= http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/scotia/gooant/gooant020303.htm|publisher= Royal Scottish Geographical Society|access-date=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Otto Nordenskiöld 1869–1928|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000091.htm|publisher= South-pole.com|access-date=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;barczewski90&quot;&gt;Barczewski, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The French organized [[French Antarctic Expedition|their first expedition]] in 1903 under the leadership of [[Jean-Baptiste Charcot]]. Originally intended as a relief expedition for the stranded Nordenskiöld party, the main work of this expedition was the mapping and charting of islands and the western coasts of [[Graham Land]], on the [[Antarctic peninsula]]. A section of the coast was explored, and named [[Loubet Land]] after the President of France.&lt;ref name= Mills&gt;{{cite book|last= Mills|first= William James|title= Exploring Polar Frontiers|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C&amp;q=Jean-Baptiste+Charcot&amp;pg=PA135|publisher= ABC-CLIO|access-date=23 September 2008|isbn= 978-1-57-607422-0|date= 11 December 2003}} pp. 135–139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jean-Baptiste Charcot|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000095.htm|publisher= South-pole.com|access-date=24 September 2008}}(''Francais'' voyage)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mill, pp. 431–32&lt;/ref&gt;

A follow up trip was organized from 1908–1910 which continued the earlier work of the French expedition with a general exploration of the Bellingshausen Sea, and the discovery of islands and other features, including [[Marguerite Bay]], [[Charcot Island]], [[Renaud Island]], [[Mikkelsen Bay]], [[Rothschild Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jean-Baptiste Charcot|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000096.htm|publisher= South-pole.com|access-date=24 September 2008}}(''Pourquoispas?'' voyage)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race to the Pole===
{{Main|Terra Nova expedition|Amundsen's South Pole expedition}}
[[File:Steam Yacht 'Terra Nova'.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Terra Nova (ship)|''Terra Nova'']] bore [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and his team on their ill-fated expedition to the South Pole.]]
The prize of the Heroic age was to reach the South Pole. Two expeditions set off in 1910 to attain this goal; a [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|party]] led by Norwegian polar explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] from the ship ''[[Fram]]'' and [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s [[Terra Nova expedition|British group]] from the [[Terra Nova (ship)|''Terra Nova'']].

Amundsen succeeded in reaching the Pole on 14 December 1911 using a route from the [[Bay of Whales]] to the polar plateau via the [[Axel Heiberg Glacier]].&lt;ref&gt;Amundsen, Vol I pp. 184–95; Vol II, pp. 120–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huntford (''Last Place on Earth''), pp. 446–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Roald Amundsen|url= http://www.norway.org.uk/history/expolorers/amundsen/amundsen.htm|publisher= Norwegian Embassy (UK)|access-date=25 September 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422100914/http://www.norway.org.uk/history/expolorers/amundsen/amundsen.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date = 22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott and his four companions reached the South Pole via the Beardmore route on 17 January 1912, 33 days after Amundsen. All five died on the return journey from the Pole, through a combination of starvation and cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Explorer and leader: Captain Scott|url= http://www.nmm.ac.uk/Scott|publisher= National Maritime Museum|access-date= 27 September 2008|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202113611/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/scott|archive-date= 2 December 2008|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] was later named after these two men.

===Further expeditions===
[[File:Mawson main base.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Main Base Hut of the [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]]]]
The [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] took place between 1911–1914 and was led by Sir [[Douglas Mawson]]. It concentrated on the stretch of Antarctic coastline between Cape Adare and Mount Gauss, carrying out mapping and survey work on coastal and inland territories.

Discoveries included [[Commonwealth Bay]], [[Ninnis Glacier]], [[Mertz Glacier]], and [[Queen Mary Land]]. Major accomplishments were made in geology, glaciology and terrestrial biology.&lt;ref name=&quot;ats&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Antarctic Treaty System: An assessment |author=National Research Council (U.S.), Polar Research Board |year=1986 |publisher=National Academies |page=96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SwrAAAAYAAJ |access-date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Endurance trapped in pack ice.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''As time wore on it became more and more evident that the ship was doomed'' by [[Frank Hurley]]. (The [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']] trapped in pack ice.)]]

The [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914–1917 was led by [[Ernest Shackleton]] and set out to cross the continent via the South pole. However, their ship, the [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']], was trapped and crushed by pack ice in the [[Weddell Sea]] before they were able to land. The expedition members survived after a journey on sledges over pack ice, a prolonged drift on an [[drift ice|ice-floe]], and a voyage in three small boats to [[Elephant Island]]. Then Shackleton and five others [[Voyage of the James Caird|crossed the Southern Ocean]] in an open boat called [[James Caird (boat)|''James Caird'']] and made the first crossing of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] to raise the alarm at the whaling station [[Grytviken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shackleton|first=Ernest Henry|title=South: The Story of Shackleton's 1914–1917 Expedition|url=https://archive.org/details/South00Shac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related component of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition was the [[Ross Sea party]], led by [[Aeneas Mackintosh]]. Its objective was to lay depots across the [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]], in order to supply Shackleton's party crossing from the Weddell Sea. All the required depots were laid, but in the process three men, including the leader Mackintosh, lost their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link = Kelly Tyler-Lewis|last= Tyler-Lewis|first= Kelly|title= The Lost Men|publisher= Bloomsbury Publishing|year= 2007|location= London|isbn= 978-0-74-757972-4|pages=193–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shackleton's last expedition and the one that brought the 'Heroic Age' to a close, was the [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition]] from 1921–22 on board the ship ''[[Quest (ship)|Quest]]''. Its vaguely defined objectives included coastal mapping, a possible continental circumnavigation, the investigation of sub-Antarctic islands, and oceanographic work. After Shackleton's death on 5 January 1922, ''Quest'' completed a shortened programme before returning home.| &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link= Roland Huntford|last= Huntford|first= Roland|title= Shackleton|publisher= Hodder &amp; Stoughton|year= 1985|location= London|isbn= 978-03-4025-007-5|page=684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further exploration==

===By air===
[[File:Wilkins arctic expedition 1926.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Hubert Wilkins]] pioneered the exploration of the Arctic regions by aircraft. Pictured, his plane and encampment as part of the Detroit Arctic Expedition, 1926.]]
After Shackleton's last expedition, there was a hiatus in Antarctic exploration for about seven years. From 1929, aircraft and mechanized transportation were increasingly used, earning this period the sobriquet of the 'Mechanical Age'. [[Hubert Wilkins]] first visited Antarctica in 1921–1922 as an [[ornithologist]] attached to the [[Shackleton-Rowett Expedition]]. From 1927, Wilkins and pilot [[Carl Ben Eielson]] began exploring the Arctic by aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Althoff, William F. ''Drift Station: Arctic outposts of superpower science''. Potomac Books Inc., Dulles, Virginia. 2007. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 1928, only a year after [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s flight across the Atlantic, Wilkins and Eielson made a trans-Arctic crossing from [[Point Barrow, Alaska]], to [[Spitsbergen]], arriving about 20 hours later on 16 April, touching along the way at Grant Land on [[Ellesmere Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkins |first= Hubert Wilkins | title=Flying the Arctic | page= 313}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this feat and his prior work, Wilkins was knighted.

With financial backing from [[William Randolph Hearst]], Wilkins returned to the South Pole and flew over [[Antarctica]] in the ''San Francisco''. He named the island of [[Hearst Land]] after his sponsor.

US Navy Rear Admiral [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] led five expeditions to Antarctica during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. He overflew the South Pole with pilot [[Bernt Balchen]] on 28 and 29 November 1929, to match his overflight of the North Pole in 1926. Byrd's explorations had science as a major objective and extensively used the aircraft to explore the continent.

Captain [[Finn Ronne]], Byrd's executive officer, returned to Antarctica with his own expedition in 1947–1948, with Navy support, three planes, and dogs. Ronne disproved the notion that the continent was divided in two and established that East and West Antarctica was one single continent, i.e. that the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea are not connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923941,00.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125113748/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923941,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=25 November 2010 | work=Time | title=Milestones, Jan. 28, 1980 | date=28 January 1980 | access-date=24 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition explored and mapped large parts of Palmer Land and the Weddell Sea coastline, and identified the [[Ronne Ice Shelf]], named by Ronne after his wife [[Edith Ronne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://traverse.npolar.no/historical-traverses/historic-names Historic Names — Norwegian-American Scientific Traverse of East Antarctica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321083109/http://traverse.npolar.no/historical-traverses/historic-names |date=2008-03-21 }}.

===Overland crossing===
{{Main|Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition}}
[[File:Sir Edmund Hillary with Rear-Admiral George Dufek at Scott Base during the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1957.jpg|thumb|[[Edmund Hillary]] (left) with Rear-Admiral [[George J. Dufek]] at [[Scott Base]] just before the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]]'s departure from the base.]]
The 1955&amp;ndash;58 [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] successfully completed the first overland crossing of [[Antarctica]], via the [[South Pole]]. Although supported by the British and other Commonwealth governments, most of the funding came from corporate and individual donations.

It was headed by British explorer Dr [[Vivian Fuchs]], with [[New Zealand]]er Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] leading the New Zealand Ross Sea Support team. After spending the winter of 1957 at Shackleton Base, Fuchs finally set out on the transcontinental journey in November 1957, with a twelve-man team travelling in six vehicles; three [[Sno-Cat]]s, two [[M29 Weasel|Weasels]] and one specially adapted ''Muskeg'' [[tractor]]. En route, the team were also tasked with carrying out scientific research including seismic soundings and gravimetric readings.

In parallel Hillary's team had set up [[Scott Base]]{{spaced ndash}}which was to be Fuchs' final destination{{spaced ndash}}on the opposite side of the continent at [[McMurdo Sound]] on the [[Ross Sea]]. Using three converted Massey [[Ferguson TE20|Ferguson TE20 tractors]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fofh.co.uk/articles/pole.htm|title=Friends of Ferguson Heritage- The Worst Journey in the World|website=www.fofh.co.uk|access-date=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one [[M29 Weasel|Weasel]] (abandoned part-way), Hillary and his three men (Ron Balham, [[Peter Mulgrew]] and Murray Ellis), were responsible for route-finding and laying a line of supply depots up the [[Skelton Glacier]] and across the [[Polar Plateau]] on towards the [[South Pole]], for the use of Fuchs on the final leg of his journey. Other members of Hillary's team carried out geological surveys around the Ross Sea and [[Victoria Land]] areas.

Hillary's party reached the South Pole on 3 January 1958, and was just the third (preceded by [[Roald Amundsen|Amundsen]] in 1911 and [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott]] in 1912) to reach the Pole overland. Fuchs' team reached the Pole from the opposite direction on 19 January 1958, where they met up with Hillary. Fuchs then continued overland, following the route that Hillary had laid and on 2 March succeeded in reaching [[Scott Base]], completing the first overland crossing of the continent by land via the South Pole.&lt;ref name=&quot;antarcticchronology&quot; /&gt;

==Political history==

===British claims===
The United Kingdom reasserted sovereignty over the [[Falkland Islands]] in the far [[South Atlantic]] in 1833 and maintained a continuous presence there. In 1908, the British government extended its territorial claim by declaring sovereignty over &quot;[[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], the [[South Orkneys]], the [[South Shetlands]], and the [[South Sandwich Islands|Sandwich Islands]], and [[Graham Land|Graham's Land]], situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and on the Antarctic continent to the south of the [[50th parallel south|50th parallel of south latitude]], and lying between the [[20th meridian west|20th]] and the [[80th meridian west|80th degrees of west longitude]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntLaw&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=cIFAZPBKKuwC&amp;pg=PA652 ''International law for Antarctica'', p. 652], Francesco Francioni and Tullio Scovazzi, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; All these territories were administered as [[Falkland Islands Dependencies]] from [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] by the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands]]. The motivation for this declaration lay in the need for regulating and taxing the [[whaling|whaling industry]] effectively. Commercial operators would hunt whales in areas outside of the official boundaries of the [[Falkland Islands]] and its dependencies and there was a need to close this loophole.

In 1917, the wording of the claim was modified, so as to, among other things, unambiguously include all the territory in the sector stretching to the [[South Pole]] (thus encompassing all of the present-day [[British Antarctic Territory]]). The new claim covered &quot;all islands and territories whatsoever between the 20th degree of west longitude and the [[50th meridian west|50th degree of west longitude]] which are situated south of the 50th parallel of south latitude; and all islands and territories whatsoever between the 50th degree of west longitude and the 80th degree of west longitude which are situated south of the [[58th parallel south|58th parallel of south latitude]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntLaw&quot;/&gt;

Under the ambition of [[Leopold Amery]], the [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]], Britain attempted to incorporate the entire continent into the [[British Empire|Empire]]. In a memorandum to the [[governor-general]]s for [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], he wrote that 'with the exception of Chile and Argentina and some barren islands belonging to France... it is desirable that the whole of the Antarctic should ultimately be included in the British Empire.'

The first step was taken on 30 July 1923, when the British government passed an [[Order in Council]] under the British Settlements Act 1887, defining the new borders for the [[Ross Dependency]] - &quot;that part of His Majesty's Dominions in the Antarctic Seas, which comprises all the islands and territories between the 160th degree of East Longitude and the 150th degree of West Longitude which are situated south of the 60th degree of South Latitude shall be named the Ross Dependency.&quot;

The Order in Council then went on to appoint the Governor-General and [[Commander-in Chief]] of [[New Zealand]] as the Governor of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/imperial/1923/0974/latest/DLM1195.html Order in Council Under the British Settlements Act, 1887 (50 &amp; 51 Vict c 54), Providing for the Government of the Ross Dependency.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the [[United Kingdom]] claimed [[Enderby Land]]. In 1933, a British imperial order transferred territory south of [[60th parallel south|60° S]] and between [[meridian (geography)|meridians]] [[160th meridian east|160° E]] and [[45th meridian east|45° E]] to Australia as the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;Antarctica and international law: a collection of inter-state and national documents, Volume 2. pp. 143.

Following the passing of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, the government of the [[United Kingdom]] relinquished all control over the government of [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]. This however had no bearing on the obligations of the Governor-General of both countries in their capacity as Governor of the Antarctic territories.

===Other European claims===

Meanwhile, alarmed by these unilateral declarations, the French government laid claim to a strip of the continent in 1924. The basis for their claim to [[Adélie Land]] lay on the discovery of the coastline in 1840 by the French explorer [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]], who named it after his wife, Adèle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=From Venus to Antarctica: The Life of Dumont D'Urville |last=Dunmore |first=John |year=2007 |publisher=Exisle Publ. |location=Auckland |isbn=9780908988716 |page=209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British eventually decided to recognize this claim and the border between [[Adélie Land]] and [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] was fixed definitively in 1938.&lt;ref name= mawson&gt;{{cite web |title= A Brief History of Mawson |publisher= Australian Government - Australian Arctic Division |url= http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=7041 |access-date= 2008-07-16 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080727085111/http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=7041 |archive-date= 27 July 2008 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments also concerned Norwegian whaling interests, who wished to avoid the British taxation of [[Whaling|whaling stations]] in the Antarctic and were concerned that they would be commercially excluded from the continent. The whale-ship owner [[Lars Christensen]] financed several expeditions to the Antarctic with the view to claim land for Norway and establish stations on Norwegian territory to gain better privileges.&lt;ref name=k52&gt;{{cite book|title=Norge i Antarktis|editor-last=Kyvik|editor-first=Helga  |location=Oslo|publisher=Schibsted Forlag|year=2008|isbn=978-82-516-2589-0|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first expedition, led by Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad, landed on [[Peter I Island]] in 1929 and claimed the island for Norway. On 6 March 1931, a Norwegian royal proclamation declared the island under Norwegian [[sovereignty]]&lt;ref name=k52 /&gt; and on 23 March 1933 the island was declared a dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lov om Bouvet-øya, Peter I's øy og Dronning Maud Land m.m.

The 1929 expedition led by [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen]] and [[Finn Lützow-Holm]] named the continental land mass near the island as [[Queen Maud Land]], named after the Norwegian queen [[Maud of Wales]].&lt;ref name=npi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npolar.no/no/antarktis/dronning-maud-land.html |publisher=[[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |access-date=10 May 2011 |language=no |title=Dronning Maud Land |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721073332/http://www.npolar.no/no/antarktis/dronning-maud-land.html |archive-date=21 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory was explored further during the ''Norvegia'' expedition of 1930–31.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snl.no/Dronning_Maud_Land |work=[[Store norske leksikon]] |access-date=9 May 2011 |first=Tore |last=Gjeldsvik |title=Dronning Maud Land |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations with the British government in 1938 resulted in the western border of Queen Maud Land being set at 20°W.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

On 14 January 1939, five days prior to the German arrival, Queen Maud Land was annexed by Norway,&lt;ref name=&quot;npi&quot;/&gt; after a royal decree announced that the land bordering the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies]] in the west and the [[Australian Antarctic Territory|Australian Antarctic Dependency]] in the east was to be brought under Norwegian sovereignty.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; The primary basis for the annexation was to secure the Norwegian whaling industry's access to the region.&lt;ref name=npi/&gt;&lt;ref name=npo1&gt;{{cite web |title=Forutsetninger for Antarktistraktaten |url=http://www.polarhistorie.no/artikler/2009/Antarktistraktaten |work=Norsk Polarhistorie |access-date=15 May 2011 |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Norway and the United Kingdom agreed to limit Queen Maud Land to from 20°W to 45°E, and that the Bruce Coast and [[Coats Land]] were to be incorporated into Norwegian territory.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

===South American involvement===
[[File:Omond House - Laurie Island.jpg|thumb|[[Orcadas Base|Omond House]] was built in 1904 by the [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]] as the first permanent base in Antarctica. It was later sold to Argentina.]]
This encroachment of foreign powers was a matter of immense disquiet to the nearby South American countries, [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]]. Taking advantage of a European continent plunged into turmoil with the onset of the [[Second World War]], Chile's president, [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]] declared the establishment of a [[Chilean Antarctic Territory]] in areas already claimed by Britain.

Argentina had an even longer history of involvement in the Continent. Already in 1904 the Argentine government began a permanent occupation in the area with the purchase of a meteorological station on [[Laurie Island]] established in 1903 by Dr [[William Speirs Bruce|William S. Bruce]]'s [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]]. Bruce offered to transfer the station and instruments for the sum of 5.000 [[peso]]s, on the condition that the government committed itself to the continuation of the scientific mission.&lt;ref name=RREE&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucema.edu.ar/ceieg/arg-rree/7/7-107.htm | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120504063019/http://www.ucema.edu.ar/ceieg/arg-rree/7/7-107.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=May 4, 2012 | title=Historia General de las Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Argentina | access-date=July 6, 2012 | author1=Escude, Carlos | author2=Cisneros, Andres | language=es }}&lt;/ref&gt; British officer William Haggard also sent a note to the Argentine Foreign Minister, Jose Terry, ratifying the terms of Bruce proposition.&lt;ref name=RREE/&gt;

In 1906, Argentina communicated to the international community the establishment of a permanent base on South Orkney Islands. However, Haggard responded by reminding Argentina that the [[South Orkneys]] were British. The British position was that Argentine personnel was granted permission only for the period of one year. The Argentine government entered into negotiations with the British in 1913 over the possible transfer of the island. Although these talks were unsuccessful, Argentina attempted to unilaterally establish their sovereignty with the erection of markers, national flags and other symbols.

In response to this and earlier German explorations, the British [[Admiralty]] and [[Colonial Office]] launched [[Operation Tabarin]] in 1943 to reassert British territorial claims against Argentine and [[Chile]]an incursion and establish a permanent British presence in the [[Antarctic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/our_history/stations_and_refuges/index.php|title=About - British Antarctic Survey|website=www.antarctica.ac.uk|access-date=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was also motivated by concerns within the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] about the direction of United States post-war activity in the region.

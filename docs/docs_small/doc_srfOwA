'''Aviation Traders Limited''' (ATL) was a [[World War II|war]]-surplus aircraft and spares trader formed in 1947. In 1949, it began maintaining aircraft used by some of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s contemporary independent [[airline]]s on the [[Berlin Blockade|Berlin Airlift]]. In the early 1950s, it branched out into aircraft conversions and manufacturing. During that period it also became a subcontractor for other aircraft manufacturers. By the end of the decade, it was taken over by the [[Airwork Services|Airwork]] group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mondey&quot;&gt;Mondey 2000, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;valuation&quot;&gt;''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;carferries&quot;&gt;''Airliner World – Britain's Carferry Airlines'', Key Publishing, Avenel, NJ, USA, July 2005, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Aviation Traders Ltd. (ATL) was established by [[Freddie Laker]] at [[RAF Bovingdon|Bovingdon]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], in 1947 to trade in war-surplus aircraft and spares. Two years later, Laker shifted his fledgling business to new premises at [[Rochford]] aerodrome (later [[London Southend Airport|Southend Municipal Airport]]) near [[Southend-on-Sea]], [[Essex]], England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mondey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, pp. 12, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

ATL initially specialised in converting numerous war-surplus bombers and transporters into freighters. This included the conversion of [[Handley Page Halifax]] bombers into freighters, six of which were sold to Bond Air Services, an early post-war independent [[United Kingdom|British]] airline. Bond Air Services based these planes at [[Wunstorf]] aerodrome in [[West Germany]] to carry essential supplies into [[West Berlin]] during the [[Berlin Blockade]] of 1948–49. Bond Air Services furthermore contracted Aviation Traders to service these planes. In return, Aviation Traders got half of Bond Air Services' freight charges.&lt;ref&gt;''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the Berlin Airlift in 1949, Laker had most of the Halifaxes he had supplied to various independent airlines during the Airlift scrapped at its [[London Southend Airport|Southend]] facilities.

Aviation Traders (Engineering) Ltd – (ATEL), ATL's engineering division, was formally established in 1949. Laker put Jack Wiseman, a fully qualified aircraft maintenance engineer with whom he had worked for a brief period at London Aero Motor Services (LASM), in charge of his new engineering business.&lt;ref&gt;''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, pp. 12/3, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Three former [[British European Airways]] (BEA) [[Vickers VC.1 Viking|Vickers Viking]]s, which Laker had acquired in 1949 as well, were overhauled at ATL's Southend maintenance base and sold on to [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) at a profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebuilt&quot;&gt;''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, ATL's engineering arm cannibalised a number of unairworthy [[Avro York|York]]s and [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]]s Laker had purchased to rebuild the salvaged parts into three airworthy Yorks.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebuilt&quot;/&gt;

ATL also became one of many post-war aircraft manufacturers seeking to develop a successor to the then ubiquitous [[Douglas DC-3]] piston [[airliner]] that continued playing a prominent role in the fleets of many of the world's airlines well into the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/stats.main?id=188 The Douglas DC-3]&lt;/ref&gt; ATL's answer was the [[Aviation Traders Accountant|ATL-90 Accountant]], which first flew on 9 July 1957. The Accountant was designed for 28 passengers and, like the more successful [[Avro 748]], [[Handley Page Dart Herald]], [[Fokker Friendship]] and [[NAMC YS-11|YS-11]], was powered by two [[Rolls-Royce Dart]] [[turboprop]] engines. At the time, ATL was competing in the DC-3 replacement market with [[Avro]], [[Handley Page]], [[Fokker]] and [[Nihon Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation]] (NAMC). These were well-established aircraft manufacturers with much deeper pockets. ATL could not match the scale of its competitors' investments, both in the design and development of the aircraft itself as well as in marketing the aircraft to potential customers. In addition, the simultaneous development of five competing designs – the ATL-90 Accountant, the Avro 748, the [[Handley Page Dart Herald|Handley Page HPR 7 Dart Herald]], the [[Fokker F27|Fokker F-27 Friendship]] and the [[NAMC YS-11]] saturated the market. As a consequence, the Accountant failed to attract orders. This led to the programme's termination. It also resulted in the [[prototype]]'s destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/3650/1/Flight%20%20Accountant%202005.pdf |title=Armstrong, P. (2005).

Subsequent conversion work proved more successful. Some [[Avro Tudor]] airliners were fitted with large freight doors to carry cargo for [[Air Charter Limited|Air Charter Ltd]] (one of ATL's sister companies) as ''Supertraders''.&lt;ref&gt;''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, pp. 36/7, 39, 40&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one [[Douglas DC-4]] airliners were converted into car ferries as the [[Aviation Traders Carvair|ATL-98 Carvair]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mondey&quot;/&gt; a major task that included replacing the aircraft's original forward fuselage with an extended version incorporating the flight-deck above the cargo hold and a side-hinged nose door through which five cars could be loaded, one at a time, by means of a mobile, ground-based &quot;scissor&quot; lift.&lt;ref&gt;''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five passengers could be accommodated in the remaining rear [[fuselage]] whose cross-section remained unaltered. The fin was enlarged to offset the destabilising effect of the enlarged forward fuselage. Many of these piston-engined Carvair aircraft were operated from [[London Southend Airport|Southend Airport]] on short [[air ferry]] routes across the [[English Channel]] or [[North Sea]]. The eventual provision of competing fast ferry services by large [[hovercraft]] (the [[SR.N4]]) meant that the age of the car-carrying airliner that commenced with the [[Bristol Freighter]] concluded with the Carvair.&lt;ref name=&quot;carferries&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, pp. 77/8&lt;/ref&gt;

ATL furthermore re-engined ''[[Canadair North Star|Argonauts]]'', BOAC's [[Canada|Canadian]]-built [[Douglas DC-4]]s, with unused [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] [[piston]] engines, which it sourced from the 88 spare Merlins Laker had acquired earlier along with BOAC's Halifaxes and several Avro Tudors purchased from the [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, pp. 38, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, ATL won a contract from [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol Aircraft]] to manufacture wing centre sections for Bristol Freighters. Between the beginning of 1952 and the end of 1955, ATL built 50 wing sections for Bristol Aircraft. During that period ATL had grown into a large engineering and manufacturing organisation.&lt;ref&gt;''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, ATL purchased over 250 surplus ex-[[Royal Air Force]] [[Percival Prentice]] [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]] aircraft, about 20 of which were converted for civilian customers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mondey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, pp. 46/7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Laker announced his decision to sell both ATL and Air Charter to Airwork for [[pound sterling|£]]600,000 cash plus a further £200,000, subject to the valuation of stock.&lt;ref name=&quot;valuation&quot;/&gt; The deal became effective in January 1959, when both companies joined the Airwork group.&lt;ref name=&quot;carferries&quot;/&gt;

In 1996, Britavia which was part of Airwork and the design arm of Shorts Support Services ceased trading as Britavia and was subject to a Management Buy-Out and started trading again as Aviation Traders Limited (ATL) which was based at Bournemouth Airport, UK until 2016. In 2016 ATL Moved to their current offices in Wimborne. ATL provided approved design services under the CAA reference of DAI/9525/96. With the introduction of EASA, ATL moved under the control of EASA and transferred to a Design Organisation Approval (DOA) under Part 21J and now Certifies and Designs fixed and rotary wing modifications under approval reference EASA.21J.016. ATL are currently opening a European company and office to continue after BREXIT.

{{Short description|Telecommunications performance metric}}
{{More footnotes|date=September 2009}}
In [[electromagnetics]], an antenna's '''power gain''' or simply '''gain''' is a key performance number which combines the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]'s [[directivity]] and [[antenna efficiency|electrical efficiency]].  In a transmitting antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts input power into [[radio wave]]s headed in a specified direction. In a receiving antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts radio waves arriving from a specified direction into electrical power. When no direction is specified, gain is understood to refer to the peak value of the gain, the gain in the direction of the antenna's [[main lobe]].  A plot of the gain as a function of direction is called the gain pattern or [[radiation pattern]].

Antenna gain is usually defined as the ratio of the power produced by the antenna from a [[far-field]] source on the antenna's beam axis to the power produced by a hypothetical lossless ''[[Isotropic radiator#Antenna theory|isotropic antenna]]'', which is equally sensitive to signals from all directions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = IEEE Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas|journal = IEEE STD 145-1993|date = 1993-07-01|pages = 1–32|doi = 10.1109/IEEESTD.1993.119664|isbn = 978-0-7381-0555-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually this ratio is expressed in [[decibels]], and these units are referred to as ''decibels-isotropic'' (dBi). An alternative definition compares the received power to the power received by a lossless [[dipole antenna|half-wave dipole antenna]], in which case the units are written as ''dBd''.  Since a lossless dipole antenna has a gain of 2.15 dBi,  the relation between these units is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Gain(dBd)} = \mathrm{Gain(dBi)} - 2.15&lt;/math&gt;. For a given frequency, the antenna's [[effective area]] is proportional to the power gain. An antenna's [[Antenna aperture#Effective length|effective length]] is proportional to the ''square root'' of the antenna's gain for a particular frequency and [[radiation resistance]]. Due to [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocity]], the gain of any reciprocal antenna when receiving is equal to its gain when transmitting.

[[Directive gain]] or directivity is a different measure which does ''not'' take an antenna's electrical efficiency into account. This term is sometimes more relevant in the case of a receiving antenna where one is concerned mainly with the ability of an antenna to receive signals from one direction while rejecting interfering signals coming from a different direction.

==Power gain==

'''Power gain''' (or simply '''gain''') is a unitless measure that combines an antenna's [[antenna efficiency|efficiency]] ''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{antenna}&lt;/math&gt;'' and directivity ''D'':

:&lt;math&gt;G = \epsilon_{antenna} \cdot D.&lt;/math&gt;
The notions of efficiency and directivity depend on the following.

===Efficiency===

The '''efficiency''' &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{antenna}&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna is the '''[[Antenna gain#Total radiated power|total radiated power]]''' &lt;math&gt;P_o&lt;/math&gt; divided by the input power at the feedpoint
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{antenna} = {P_o \over P_{in}}&lt;/math&gt;
A transmitting antenna is supplied power by a [[feedline]], a [[transmission line]] connecting the antenna to a [[radio transmitter]].   The '''input power''' &lt;math&gt;P_{in}&lt;/math&gt; to the antenna is typically defined to be the power supplied to the antenna's terminals (the ''feedpoint''), so antenna power losses do not include power lost due to [[joule heating]] in the feedline and reflections back down the feedline due to antenna/line [[impedance matching|impedance mismatches]].  

The electromagnetic [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocity theorem]] guarantees that the electrical properties of an antenna, such as efficiency, directivity, and gain, are the same when the antenna is used for receiving as when it is transmitting.

===Directivity===

An antenna's directivity is determined by its [[radiation pattern]], how the radiated power is distributed with direction in [[three dimensions]].  All antennas are directional to a greater or lesser extent, meaning that they radiate more power in some directions than others.  The direction is specified here in [[spherical coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Horizontal coordinate system|'''altitude''']] or angle above a specified reference plane (such as the ground), while &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the '''azimuth''' as the angle between the projection of the given direction onto the reference plane and a specified reference direction (such as north or east) in that plane with specified sign (either clockwise or counterclockwise).

The distribution of output power as a function of the possible directions &lt;math&gt;(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is given by its [[radiation intensity]] &lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; (in [[SI units]]: watts per steradian, W⋅sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).  The output power is obtained from the radiation intensity by integrating the latter over all solid angles &lt;math&gt;d\Omega = \cos\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P_o =\int_{-\pi}^\pi\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}U(\theta,\phi) \, d\Omega = \int_{-\pi}^\pi\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}U(\theta,\phi) \cos \theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''mean radiation intensity''' &lt;math&gt;\overline U&lt;/math&gt; is therefore given by
:&lt;math&gt;\overline U =\frac{P_o}{4\pi}~~&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; since there are 4&amp;pi; steradians in a sphere
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=\frac{\epsilon_{antenna}\cdot P_{in}}{4\pi}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; using the first formula for &lt;math&gt;P_o&lt;/math&gt;.

The directive gain or '''directivity''' &lt;math&gt;D(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna in a given direction is the ratio of its radiation intensity &lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; in that direction to its mean radiation intensity &lt;math&gt;\overline U&lt;/math&gt;.  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;D(\theta,\phi)=\frac{U(\theta,\phi)}{\overline U}.&lt;/math&gt;

An isotropic antenna, meaning one with the same radiation intensity in all directions, therefore has directivity, D = 1, in all directions independent of its efficiency.  More generally the maximum, minimum, and mean directivities of any antenna are always at least 1, at most 1, and exactly 1.  For the [[half-wave dipole]] the respective values are 1.64 (2.15 [[Decibel|dB]]), 0, and 1.

When the directivity &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna is given independently of direction it refers to its maximum directivity in any direction, namely
:&lt;math&gt;D=\max_{\theta, \, \phi}D(\theta,\phi).&lt;/math&gt;

===Gain===

The power gain or simply '''gain''' &lt;math&gt;G(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna in a given direction takes efficiency into account by being defined as the ratio of its radiation intensity &lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; in that direction to the mean radiation intensity of a perfectly efficient antenna.  Since the latter equals &lt;math&gt;P_{in}/4\pi&lt;/math&gt;, it is therefore given by

:&lt;math&gt;G(\theta,\phi)=\frac{U(\theta,\phi)}{P_{in}/4\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=\epsilon_{antenna}\cdot\frac{U(\theta,\phi)}{\overline U}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; using the second equation for &lt;math&gt;\overline U&lt;/math&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=\epsilon_{antenna}\cdot D(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; using the equation for &lt;math&gt;D(\theta,\phi).&lt;/math&gt;

As with directivity, when the gain &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna is given independently of direction it refers to its maximum gain in any direction.   Since the only difference between gain and directivity in any direction is a constant factor of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{antenna}&lt;/math&gt; independent of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the fundamental formula of this section:

:&lt;math&gt;G=\epsilon_{antenna}\cdot D.&lt;/math&gt;

===Summary===

If only a certain portion of the electrical power received from the transmitter is actually radiated by the antenna (i.e. less than 100% efficiency), then the directive gain compares the power radiated in a given direction to that reduced power (instead of the total power received), ignoring the inefficiency. The directivity is therefore the maximum directive gain when taken over all directions, and is always ''at least'' 1.  On the other hand, the power gain takes into account the poorer efficiency by comparing the radiated power in a given direction to the actual power that the antenna receives from the transmitter, which makes it a more useful figure of merit for the antenna's contribution to the ability of a transmitter in sending a radio wave toward a receiver.  In every direction, the power gain of an isotropic antenna is equal to the efficiency, and hence is always ''at most'' 1, though it can and ideally should exceed 1 for a [[directional antenna]].

Note that in the case of an [[impedance matching|impedance mismatch]], ''P&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' would be computed as the transmission line's incident power minus reflected power. Or equivalently, in terms of the rms voltage ''V'' at the antenna terminals:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{in} = V^2 \cdot \text{Re} \left\lbrace \frac{1}{Z_{in}} \right\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Antenna (radio)#Impedance|feedpoint impedance]].

==Gain in decibels==
Published numbers for antenna gain are almost always expressed in [[decibels]] (dB), a logarithmic scale.  From the gain factor G, one finds the gain in decibels as:
:&lt;math&gt;G_{dBi} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(G\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, an antenna with a peak power gain of 5 would be said to have a gain of 7 dBi. dBi is used rather than just dB to emphasize that this is the gain according to the basic definition, in which the antenna is compared to an isotropic radiator.

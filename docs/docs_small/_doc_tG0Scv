==Transport==

=== Road ===
[[File:Greyfriars Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 854117.jpg|thumb|Underneath Greyfriar's Bridge, Hereford.]]
Hereford, as an ancient crossing over the River Wye, has long been important within the regional and national transport network. Today, the town is served by several major routes, including:

* {{UK road|A49}} | Southbound: [[Ross-on-Wye]]. | Northbound: [[Leominster]] and [[Shrewsbury]].
* {{UK road|A438}} | Westbound: [[Hay-on-Wye]] and [[Brecon]]. | Eastbound: [[Ledbury]] and [[Tewkesbury]].
* {{UK road|A465}} | South-west: [[Abergavenny]] and [[Merthyr Tydfil]]. | North-east: [[Bromyard]].
* {{UK road|A4103}} | North-east: [[Worcester, England|Worcester]].

The nearest motorway is the {{UK road|M50}}, which passes to the south of Ledbury.

Along the northern rim of the City, the A4103 is named &quot;[[Roman roads|Roman Road]],&quot; running in a straight line from east to west.

Only one of these major routes [[List of crossings of the River Wye|crosses the River Wye]], the A49/Victoria Street, which is carried by Greyfriars Bridge.

In 2017, Hereford was named Britain's &quot;second slowest city,&quot; with an average traffic speed of 14.09&amp;nbsp;mph. Cambridge topped the list, whilst London came third with vehicles travelling at an average 14.59&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lubin|first=Rhian|date=April 11, 2017|title=The slowest motorway in Britain has been revealed - and no-one is surprised|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/slowest-motorway-britain-been-revealed-10202184|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730114944/https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/slowest-motorway-britain-been-revealed-10202184|archive-date=July 30, 2019|access-date=June 6, 2020|website=[[Daily Mirror]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future====
There have been plans for many years for a north–south [[bypass (road)|bypass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/4157187.High_hopes_for_Hereford___60m_bypass_bid/ |title=Hereford Times |publisher=Hereford Times |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404142710/http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/4157187.High_hopes_for_Hereford___60m_bypass_bid/ |archivedate=4 April 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently the plan is for a nine-mile (14&amp;nbsp;km) [[dual carriageway]]; however, HM Government as yet has refused to grant permission or supply funds. However, the Hereford Link Road was completed in December 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/info/200196/roads/252/hereford_2020/3|title=Hereford 2020|last=Council|first=Herefordshire|website=www.herefordshire.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=20 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420110607/https://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/info/200196/roads/252/hereford_2020/3|archive-date=20 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; costing around £34,000,000 to build.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-42396310|title=New £34m city link road opened|date=18 December 2017|access-date=20 April 2019|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420113609/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-42396310|archive-date=20 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans to add new homes, a university building and a transport hub to this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hereford_2020|title=City Link Road - post regeneration|date=7 February 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo1kVMELuEY|access-date=20 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105084945/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo1kVMELuEY&amp;gl=US&amp;hl=en|archive-date=5 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{The Railways of Hereford}}

===Rail===
[[Hereford railway station]] is situated to the north of the city centre. The station is the western terminus of the [[Cotswold Line]], and is a through station on the [[Welsh Marches line|Welsh Marches Line]] between [[Abergavenny]] and [[Leominster]].

The station is managed by [[Transport for Wales Rail Services|Transport for Wales]], which operates services to destinations such as [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Cardiff]], and [[Swansea]] to the south. Transport for Wales also operates services northbound towards [[Leominster railway station|Leominster]], [[Shrewsbury railway station|Shrewsbury]], [[Chester railway station|Chester]], [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Manchester]], and [[North Wales]].

On the Cotswold Line, services are operated by [[West Midlands Railway]] (WMR) towards [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]], via destinations such as [[Great Malvern railway station|the Malverns]], [[Worcester Foregate Street railway station|Worcester]], and [[Bromsgrove railway station|Bromsgrove]]. [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] (GWR) also operates regular services to [[London Paddington station|London Paddington]] via [[Worcester Shrub Hill railway station|Worcester]], [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]], and [[Reading railway station|Reading]], amongst other destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=National Rail Train Operators|url=https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/nationalrailoperatorsmapzoom63.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 6, 2020|website=[[Rail Delivery Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second station has also served Hereford in the past, [[Hereford Barton railway station|Hereford Barton]], which closed in 1893.

=== Cycling ===
Cycling infrastructure in Hereford is maintained by [[Herefordshire Council]] and [[Sustrans]].

An unbroken [[Shared use path|shared-use path]] for cyclists and pedestrians runs along the western rim of the city, from Newton Farm to [[Holmer, Herefordshire|Holmer]]. The Great Western Way route crosses the River Wye using Hunderton Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Hereford Walking and Cycling Map|url=https://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/2527/hereford_walking_and_cycling_map.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200605235338/https://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/2527/hereford_walking_and_cycling_map.pdf|archive-date=June 5, 2020|access-date=June 5, 2020|website=[[Herefordshire Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Cycle Network|National Cycle Route 46]] runs southbound from Hereford to Swansea. The route is signposted and unbroken, and the next destination from Hereford ''en route'' is [[Kilpeck Castle]]. The route passes through [[Abergavenny]] and the [[Heads of the Valleys]] as it enters [[Wales]]. As of Summer 2020, Sustrans proposes an extension to Route 46 running eastbound from Hereford to [[Worcester, England|Worcester]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Herefordshire's Rural Cycling Network|url=https://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/2530/rural_cycling_map.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200605234956/https://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/2530/rural_cycling_map.pdf|archive-date=June 5, 2020|access-date=June 5, 2020|website=[[Herefordshire Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Cycle Network|National Cycle Route 44]] leaves Hereford to the southeast and runs as far as [[Rotherwas Chapel|Rotherwas]]. The route is incomplete; once completed, Route 44 will run to [[Ludlow Castle]] to the north and [[Cinderford]], [[Forest of Dean]] to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Military associations==
In 1999, the British Army [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) moved from their base at Stirling Lines in Hereford since 1960 to a former [[Royal Air Force]] base [[RAF Hereford|RAF Credenhill]] in [[Credenhill]] that had been redeveloped and was designated as [[Stirling Lines]] in 2000. The clock tower on which the names of deceased SAS soldiers are inscribed was re-located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|date=19 May 1980|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924110,00.html|title=World: Britain's SAS.: Who Dares Wins|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=9 January 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120104040/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924110,00.html|archivedate=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regeneration==
Many of the schools in Hereford have been rebuilt and improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/8189738.stm |title=BBC News |work=BBC News |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Herefordshire and Ludlow College]] has also been rebuilt to a 21st-century standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hct.ac.uk/College/h_campus.html |title=Herefordshire College of Technology |publisher=Hct.ac.uk |accessdate=28 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124130426/http://www.hct.ac.uk/College/h_campus.html |archivedate=24 January 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new higher education institution NMITE (New Model Institute for Technology and Engineering)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nmite.ac.uk/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404131335/https://nmite.ac.uk/ |archive-date=4 April 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also being developed, which, once validated, will teach Engineering in a liberal context. The first staff were appointed in 2018 and the first cohort of students will enter in 2020 subject to Validation. There have also been a number of improvements at [[Hereford Sixth Form College]], where a new business block extension was completed in 2013 and a new reception area was completed in 2015.

Hereford benefitted from the [[Private finance initiative|PFI]] reconstruction schemes for NHS hospitals, with the former County Hospital site having £60 million spent on a brand new, one-site hospital to replace the former 3 hospitals: the General, the Eye Hospital, and the County Hospital. The new Hereford County Hospital was the single largest investment in Herefordshire at that point. In 2015, further funds for more improvements at the hospital were granted.

===Current and future projects===
A major regeneration project is taking place in Hereford city centre, formerly known as the [[Edgar Street Grid]]. This covers an area of around {{convert|100|acre|km2}} just north of the old city walls. Work started on 8 October 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/9172256.Work_starts_on_Hereford_s_old_cattle_market/ |title=Work Starts on Hereford's Old Cattle Market |publisher=Herefordtimes.com |date=2 August 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404142654/http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/9172256.Work_starts_on_Hereford_s_old_cattle_market/ |archivedate=4 April 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and should take around 15 years to complete the whole project. The regeneration includes the rebuilding of the canal basin at the end of the currently disused [[Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal]].
The £80 million phase 1 includes a supermarket, department store, multiplex cinema, shops, restaurants, and other facilities and opened in late Spring 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanhopeplc.com/?page=42&amp;id=617 |title=Stanhope PLC |publisher=Stanhope PLC |date=5 January 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330053522/http://www.stanhopeplc.com/?page=42&amp;id=617 |archivedate=30 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Butter [[market (place)|Market]] is also due for refurbishment and proposals are being examined.

A proposed [[bypass (road)|bypass]] has been drawn up to circulate the city, which suffers from rush hour traffic, with potential routes either to the east or west of the city. Both routes would connect with the Rotherwas Access Road which was recently completed, connecting the Rotherwas [[Industrial Estate]] to the [[A49 road|A49]]. Rotherwas itself has recently been awarded an [[Enterprise Zone]] status by the government which is expected to boost the economy and bring in thousands of new jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-14555547 |title=Rotherwas named Enterprise Zone |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904050723/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-14555547 |archivedate=4 September 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second railway station for Hereford has been discussed, which would be situated in Rotherwas as part of the Enterprise Zone.

Hereford is due to receive half of the 20,600 new homes expected to be built in the county by 2026 as part of the [[Regional Spatial Strategy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmra.gov.uk/Planning_and_Regional_Spatial_Strategy/Regional_Spatial_Strategy/Regional_Spatial_Strategy_(RSS).aspx |title=West Midlands Regional Spatial Strategy |publisher=Wmra.gov.uk |date=31 March 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228022336/http://www.wmra.gov.uk/Planning_and_Regional_Spatial_Strategy/Regional_Spatial_Strategy/Regional_Spatial_Strategy_(RSS).aspx |archivedate=28 December 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

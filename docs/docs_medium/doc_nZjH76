A contemporary of Descartes, [[Thomas Hobbes]] described reason as a broader version of &quot;addition and subtraction&quot; which is not limited to numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=De Corpore|url=https://archive.org/details/englishworkstho21hobbgoog|last=Hobbes|first=Thomas|editor-last=Molesworth|publisher=London, J. Bohn|year=1839}}: &quot;We must not therefore think that computation, that is, ratiocination, has place only in numbers, as if man were distinguished from other living creatures (which is said to have been the opinion of ''[[Pythagoras]]'') by nothing but the faculty of numbering; for ''magnitude, body, motion, time, degrees of quality, action, conception, proportion, speech and names'' (in which all the kinds of philosophy consist) are capable of addition and substraction {{sic}}. Now such things as we add or substract, that is, which we put into an account, we are said to ''consider'', in Greek λογίζεσθαι [''logizesthai''], in which language also συλλογίζεσθι [''syllogizesthai''] signifies to ''compute'', ''reason'', or ''reckon''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of reason is sometimes termed &quot;calculative&quot; reason. Similar to Descartes, Hobbes asserted that &quot;No discourse whatsoever, can end in absolute knowledge of fact, past, or to come&quot; but that &quot;sense and memory&quot; is absolute knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Thomas|last=Hobbes|title=The English Works of Thomas Hobbes|volume=3 (Leviathan) |chapter=VII.

In the late 17th century, through the 18th century, [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]] developed Descartes' line of thought still further. Hume took it in an especially [[skepticism|skeptical]] direction, proposing that there could be no possibility of [[deductive reasoning|deducing]] relationships of cause and effect, and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone, even if it seems otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|chapter=XXVII On Identity and Diversity|origyear=1689|chapter-url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=761&amp;chapter=80770&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|edition=12th|year=1824|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 1|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last=Hume|chapter=I.IV.VI.

Hume famously remarked that, &quot;We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last=Hume|chapter=II.III.III.

In the 18th century, [[Immanuel Kant]] attempted to show that Hume was wrong by demonstrating that a &quot;[[transcendental arguments|transcendental]]&quot; self, or &quot;I&quot;, was a necessary condition of all experience. Therefore, suggested Kant, on the basis of such a self, it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge. And so long as these limits are respected, reason can be the vehicle of morality, justice, aesthetics, theories of knowledge ([[epistemology]]), and understanding.

===Substantive and formal reason===

In the formulation of Kant, who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject, the great achievement of reason ({{lang-de|Vernunft}}) is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law-making. Kant was able therefore to reformulate the basis of moral-practical, theoretical and aesthetic reasoning, on &quot;universal&quot; laws.

Here [[practical reason]]ing is the self-legislating or self-governing formulation of universal [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], and [[theory|theoretical]] reasoning the way humans posit universal [[natural law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason''; ''Critique of Practical Reason''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under practical reason, the moral [[autonomy]] or freedom of human beings depends on their ability to behave according to laws that are given to them by the proper exercise of that reason. This contrasted with earlier forms of morality, which depended on [[religion|religious understanding]] and interpretation, or [[nature]] for their substance.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sandel, ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?'', New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kant, in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit, so long as their actions conform to principles given by reason. He formulated such a principle, called the &quot;[[categorical imperative]]&quot;, which would justify an action only if it could be universalized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellington&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|author2=translated by James W. Ellington [1785]|title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals 3rd ed.|publisher=Hackett|year=1993|page=[https://archive.org/details/groundingformet000kant/page/30 30]|isbn=978-0-87220-166-8|url=https://archive.org/details/groundingformet000kant/page/30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to Hume then, Kant insists that reason itself (German ''[[wikt:Vernunft|Vernunft]]'') has natural ends itself, the solution to the metaphysical problems, especially the discovery of the foundations of morality. Kant claimed that this problem could be solved with his &quot;[[transcendental logic]]&quot; which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument, which can be used indifferently, as it was for Aristotle, but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|year=2002| chapter=On Kant's Socratism|title=Being After Rousseau|publisher=University of Chicago Press}} and Kant's own first preface to ''[[The Critique of Pure Reason]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jürgen Habermas]], the &quot;substantive unity&quot; of reason has dissolved in modern times, such that it can no longer answer the question &quot;How should I live?&quot; Instead, the unity of reason has to be strictly formal, or &quot;procedural&quot;. He thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres (on the model of Kant's three critiques):

# ''Cognitive–instrumental reason'' is the kind of reason employed by the sciences. It is used to observe events, to predict and control outcomes, and to intervene in the world on the basis of its hypotheses;
# ''Moral–practical reason'' is what we use to deliberate and discuss issues in the moral and political realm, according to universalizable procedures (similar to Kant's categorical imperative); and
# ''Aesthetic reason'' is typically found in works of art and literature, and encompasses the novel ways of seeing the world and interpreting things that those practices embody.

For Habermas, these three spheres are the domain of experts, and therefore need to be mediated with the &quot;[[lifeworld]]&quot; by philosophers. In drawing such a picture of reason, Habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason, which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life, could be made up for by the unity of reason's formalizable procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The critique of reason===

[[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Richard Rorty|Rorty]], and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means, or ought to mean. Some, like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Rorty, are skeptical about subject-centred, universal, or instrumental reason, and even skeptical toward reason as a whole. Others, including Hegel, believe that it has obscured the importance of [[intersubjectivity]], or &quot;spirit&quot; in human life, and attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be.

Some thinkers, e.g. Foucault, believe there are other ''forms'' of reason, neglected but essential to modern life, and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jürgen Habermas 1990&quot;/&gt;

In the last several decades, a number of proposals have been made to &quot;re-orient&quot; this critique of reason, or to recognize the &quot;other voices&quot; or &quot;new departments&quot; of reason:

For example, in opposition to subject-centred reason, Habermas has proposed a model of [[communicative rationality|communicative reason]] that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity, based on the fact of linguistic [[intersubjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Theory of Communicative Action: Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', translated by Thomas McCarthy. Boston: Beacon Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolas Kompridis]] has proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as &quot;that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness&quot; in human affairs, and a focus on reason's possibilities for social change.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006. See also Nikolas Kompridis, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096725500750039282 &quot;So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean&quot;], ''International Journal of Philosophical Studies'' 8:3, 271–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], influenced by the 20th century German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], has proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of [[world disclosure|disclosure]], which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life, as a new &quot;department&quot; of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, ''Philosophical Arguments'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), 12; 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot;, Michel Foucault proposed a concept of critique based on Kant's distinction between &quot;private&quot; and &quot;public&quot; uses of reason. This distinction, as suggested, has two dimensions:
* ''Private reason'' is the reason that is used when an individual is &quot;a cog in a machine&quot; or when one &quot;has a role to play in society and jobs to do: to be a soldier, to have taxes to pay, to be in charge of a parish, to be a civil servant&quot;.
* ''Public reason'' is the reason used &quot;when one is reasoning as a reasonable being (and not as a cog in a machine), when one is reasoning as a member of reasonable humanity&quot;. In these circumstances, &quot;the use of reason must be free and public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot;, ''The Essential Foucault'', New York: The New Press, 2003, 43–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reason compared to related concepts==

===Compared to logic===
{{Main|Logic}}
The terms &quot;logic&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; are sometimes used as if they were identical with the term &quot;reason&quot; or with the concept of being &quot;rational&quot;, or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason. For example in modern [[economics]], [[Rational choice theory|rational choice]] is assumed to equate to logically [[Consistency|consistent]] choice.

Reason and logic can however be thought of as distinct, although logic is one important aspect of reason. Author [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', characterizes the distinction in this way. Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Hofstadter, ''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', Vintage, 1979, {{ISBN|0-394-74502-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reason is a type of [[thought]], and the word &quot;[[logic]]&quot; involves the attempt to describe rules or norms by which reasoning operates, so that orderly reasoning can be taught. The oldest surviving writing to explicitly consider the rules by which reason operates are the works of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Aristotle]], especially ''Prior Analysis'' and ''Posterior Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Complete Works'' (2 volumes), Princeton, 1995, {{ISBN|0-691-09950-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Ancient Greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason, Aristotle's [[neologism|newly coined word]] &quot;[[syllogism]]&quot; (''syllogismos'') identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study. When Aristotle referred to &quot;the logical&quot; (''hē logikē''), he was referring more broadly to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/searchresults?all_words=logiko/s&amp;all_words_expand=yes&amp;la=greek See this Perseus search, and compare English translations.] and see [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph.jsp?l=logikw%3Ds&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=le/getai&amp;d=Perseus:text:1999.01.0049:book=1:section=1217b&amp;i=1#lexicon LSJ dictionary entry for λογικός, section II.2.b.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason compared to cause-and-effect thinking, and symbolic thinking===
{{Main|Causality|Symbols}}
As pointed out by philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke and Hume, some animals are also clearly capable of a type of &quot;[[association (psychology)|associative thinking]]&quot;, even to the extent of associating causes and effects. A dog once kicked, can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future, but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word. It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Treatise of Human Nature]] of [[David Hume]], [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;chapter=55113&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Book I, Part III, Sect. XVI].&lt;/ref&gt;

Human reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas, even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect, perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of [[John Locke|Locke]], for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of [[syllogism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|volume= 2|chapter=XVII Of Reason|origyear=1689|chapter-url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=762&amp;layout=html#chapter_80842|edition=12th|year=1824|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of [[symbol]]s, as well as [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|indices and icons]], according to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], the symbols having only a nominal, though habitual, connection to either smoke or fire.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Deacon, ''The Symbolic Species: The Co-Evolution of Language and the Brain'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1998, {{ISBN|0-393-31754-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of such a system of artificial symbols and signs is [[language]].

The connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers. [[Thomas Hobbes]] described the creation of &quot;Markes, or Notes of remembrance&quot; (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' Ch. 4) as ''speech''. He used the word ''speech'' as an English version of the Greek word ''[[logos]]'' so that speech did not need to be communicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html#CHAPTERIV Leviathan Chapter IV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615025735/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html |date=2006-06-15 }}: &quot;The Greeks have but one word, logos, for both speech and reason; not that they thought there was no speech without reason, but no reasoning without speech&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When communicated, such speech becomes language, and the marks or notes or remembrance are called &quot;[[Sign (linguistics)|Signes]]&quot; by Hobbes. Going further back, although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason (''logos''), he does mention that animals with imagination, for whom sense perceptions can persist, come closest to having something like reasoning and ''[[nous]]'', and even uses the word &quot;logos&quot; in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason, imagination, mimesis, and memory===
{{Main|Imagination|Mimesis|Memory|Recollection}}
Reason and [[imagination]] rely on similar [[mental processes]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] (2005). ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Imagination is not only found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that ''phantasia'' (imagination: that which can hold images or ''phantasmata'') and ''phronein'' (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Anima]]'' III.i–iii; ''On Memory and Recollection'', ''On Dreams''&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or ''logos''. But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.

The recent modern writings of [[Terrence Deacon]] and [[Merlin Donald]], writing about the [[origin of language]], also connect reason connected to not only [[language]], but also [[mimesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Mimesis in modern academic writing, starting with [[Erich Auerbach]], is a technical word, which is not necessarily exactly the same in meaning as the original Greek. See [[Mimesis]].&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically they describe the ability to create [[language]] as part of an internal modeling of [[reality]] specific to humankind. Other results are [[consciousness]], and [[imagination]] or [[fantasy]]. In contrast, modern proponents of a genetic predisposition to language itself include [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker]], to whom Donald and Deacon can be contrasted.

As reason is symbolic thinking, and peculiarly human, then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of &quot;icons&quot; or images and the real things they represent. Starting with a modern author, Merlin Donald writes&lt;ref&gt;Origins of the Modern Mind p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A dog might perceive the &quot;meaning&quot; of a fight that was realistically play-acted by humans, but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent (a real fight). [...] Trained apes are able to make this distinction; young children make this distinction early – hence, their effortless distinction between play-acting an event and the event itself&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In classical descriptions, an equivalent description of this mental faculty is ''eikasia'', in the philosophy of Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the [[Meno]]'' Ch.5&lt;/ref&gt; This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else, related somehow but not the same, and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. What Klein refers to as ''dianoetic eikasia'' is the ''eikasia'' concerned specifically with thinking and mental images, such as those mental symbols, icons, ''signes'', and marks discussed above as definitive of reason. Explaining reason from this direction: human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible &quot;objects of thought&quot; as &quot;foundations&quot; (''hypothēses'' in Ancient Greek). This thinking (''dianoia'') is &quot;...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more 'precise' ''noēta''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Merlin Donald and the Socratic authors such as Plato and Aristotle emphasize the importance of ''mimesis'', often translated as ''imitation'' or ''representation''. Donald writes&lt;ref&gt;Origins of the Modern Mind p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation is found especially in monkeys and apes [... but ...] Mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations. [...] Mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Mimēsis'' is a concept, now popular again in academic discussion, that was particularly prevalent in Plato's works, and within Aristotle, it is discussed mainly in the ''Poetics''. In Michael Davis's account of the theory of man in this work.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Introduction&quot; to the translation of ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' by Davis and [[Seth Benardete]] p. xvii, xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the distinctive feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions, internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...&lt;ref&gt;Davis is here using &quot;poetic&quot; in an unusual sense, questioning the contrast in Aristotle between action (''praxis'', the ''praktikē'') and making (''poēsis'', the ''poētikē''): &quot;Human [peculiarly human] action is imitation of action because thinking is always rethinking. Aristotle can define human beings as at once rational animals, political animals, and imitative animals because in the end the three are the same.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Donald like Plato (and Aristotle, especially in ''On Memory and Recollection''), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek ''anamnēsis'', normally translated as &quot;recollection&quot; was opposed to ''mneme'' or ''memory''. Memory, shared with some animals,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [[On Memory]] 450a 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past, but also ''that'' something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of ''eikasia''&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;...but nothing except man is able to recollect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle Hist. Anim. I.1.488b.25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, &quot;To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Donald calls the same thing ''autocueing'', which he explains as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''The Origins of the Modern Mind'' p. 173 see also ''A Mind So Rare'' pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues – probably the earliest form of representational ''thinking''.&quot;

In a celebrated paper in modern times, the fantasy author and philologist [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote in his essay &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; that the terms &quot;fantasy&quot; and &quot;enchantment&quot; are connected to not only &quot;....the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires....&quot; but also &quot;...the origin of language and of the mind&quot;.

===Logical reasoning methods and argumentation===
A subdivision of [[philosophy]] is [[logic]]. Logic is the study of reasoning.  Looking at logical categorizations of different types of reasoning, the traditional main division made in philosophy is between [[deductive reasoning]] and [[inductive reasoning]]. [[Logic|Formal logic]] has been described as ''the science of deduction''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, Richard. 1991. ''Formal logic: its scope and limits'', (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill:1.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as [[informal logic]] or [[critical thinking]].

====Deductive reasoning====
{{Main|Deductive reasoning}}
Deduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises. A deduction is also the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process.  One classic example of deductive reasoning is that found in [[syllogism]]s like the following:
* Premise 1: All humans are mortal.
* Premise 2: Socrates is a human.
* Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.

The reasoning in this argument is deductively [[Validity (logic)|valid]] because there is no way in which the premises, 1 and 2, could be true and the conclusion, 3, be false.

====Inductive reasoning====
{{Main|Inductive reasoning}}
Induction is a form of inference producing propositions about unobserved objects or types, either specifically or generally, based on previous observation. It is used to ascribe [[category of being|properties or relations]] to objects or [[type (metaphysics)|types]] based on [[event (philosophy)|previous observations or experiences]], or to formulate general statements or [[law (principle)|laws]] based on limited observations of recurring [[phenomena]]l patterns.

Inductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning in that, even in the best, or strongest, cases of inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of [[probability]]. Relatedly, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.

A classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the [[empiricist]] [[David Hume]]:
* Premise: The sun has risen in the east every morning up until now.
* Conclusion: The sun will also rise in the east tomorrow.

====Analogical reasoning====
{{Main|Analogical reasoning}}
Analogical reasoning is a form of inductive reasoning from a particular to a particular. It is often used in [[case-based reasoning]], especially legal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas N. |authorlink=Douglas N. Walton |date=2014 |chapter=Argumentation schemes for argument from analogy |editor-last=Ribeiro |editor-first=Henrique Jales |title=Systematic approaches to argument by analogy |series=Argumentation library |volume=25 |location=Cham; New York |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=23–40 |isbn=978-3-319-06333-1 |oclc=884441074 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-06334-8_2|chapter-url=https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/crrarpub/15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example follows:
* Premise 1: Socrates is human and mortal.
* Premise 2: Plato is human.
* Conclusion: Plato is mortal.

Analogical reasoning is a weaker form of inductive reasoning from a single example, because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Vickers |first=John |title=The Problem of Induction |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2009 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/ |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions. For example:
* Premise 1: Socrates is human and male.
* Premise 2: [[Ada Lovelace]] is human.
* Conclusion: Therefore Ada Lovelace is male.

====Abductive reasoning====
{{Main|Abductive reasoning}}
Abductive reasoning, or argument to the best explanation, is a form of reasoning that doesn't fit in deductive or inductive, since it starts with incomplete set of observations and proceeds with likely possible explanations so the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved. What distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others, by subjective judgement or attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion, given a set of more or less disputable assumptions. For example, when a patient displays certain symptoms, there might be various possible causes, but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable.

====Fallacious reasoning====
{{Main|Fallacy|Formal fallacy|Informal fallacy}}
Flawed reasoning in arguments is known as [[fallacy|fallacious reasoning]]. Bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a [[formal fallacy]] or an [[informal fallacy]].

Formal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form, or structure, of the argument. The word &quot;formal&quot; refers to this link to the ''form'' of the argument. An argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid.

An informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the ''content'', rather than mere ''structure'', of the argument.

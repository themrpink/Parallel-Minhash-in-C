'''Clara Josephine Schumann''' ({{IPA-de|ˈklaːʁa ˈʃuːman|}}; née '''Wieck'''; 13 September 1819 – 20 May 1896) was a German pianist, composer and piano teacher. Regarded as one of the most distinguished pianists of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]], she exerted her influence over a 61-year concert career, changing the format and repertoire of the piano recital from displays of virtuosity to programs of serious works. She also composed solo piano pieces, a [[piano concerto]] ([[Piano Concerto (Clara Schumann)|her Op. 7]]), chamber music, choral pieces, and songs.

She grew up in [[Leipzig]], where her father, [[Friedrich Wieck]], was a professional pianist and teacher, and her mother an accomplished singer. She was a child prodigy, trained by her father. She began touring at age eleven, and was successful in Paris and Vienna, among other cities. She married composer [[Robert Schumann]], and the couple had eight children. Together, they encouraged [[Johannes Brahms]] and maintained a close relationship with him. She premiered many works by her husband and by Brahms in public.

After Robert Schumann's early death, she continued her concert tours in Europe for decades, frequently with the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] and other chamber musicians. Beginning in 1878, she was an influential piano educator at [[Hoch Conservatory|Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium]] in Frankfurt, where she attracted international students. She edited the publication of her husband's work. Schumann died in Frankfurt, but was buried in [[Bonn]] beside her husband.

Several films have focused on Schumann's life, the earliest being ''[[Dreaming (1944 German film)|Träumerei]]'' (''Dreaming'') of 1944. A 2008 film, ''[[Geliebte Clara]]'' (''Beloved Clara''), was directed by [[Helma Sanders-Brahms]]. An image of Clara Schumann from an 1835 lithograph by [[Andreas Staub]] was featured on the 100 [[Deutsche Mark]] banknote from 1989 to 2002. Interest in her compositions began to revive in the late 20th century, and her 2019 bicentenary prompted new books and exhibitions.

=== Early life ===
==== Family ====
Clara Josephine Wieck {{IPA-de|ˈklaːʀa ˈjoːzɛfiːn ˈviːk|}} was born in [[Leipzig]] on 13 September 1819 to [[Friedrich Wieck]] and his wife [[Mariane Bargiel|Mariane]] (''née'' Tromlitz).{{sfn|Hall|2002|p=1124}} Her mother was a famous singer in Leipzig who performed weekly piano and soprano solos at the [[Gewandhaus]].{{sfn|Haisler|2003}} Clara's parents had irreconcilable differences, in part due to her father's unyielding nature.{{sfn|Haisler|2003}} Prompted by an affair between her mother and Adolph Bargiel, her father's friend,{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|pp=5, 13}}{{sfn|Borchard|1991|p=[https://books.google.de/books?id=kdLlCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27 27]}} the Wiecks were divorced in 1825, with Mariane later marrying Bargiel. Five-year-old Clara remained with her father while Mariane and Bargiel eventually moved to Berlin, limiting contact between Clara and her mother to written letters and occasional visits.{{sfn|Nauhaus Bargiel|2019}}

==== Child prodigy ====
From an early age, Clara's father planned her career and life down to the smallest detail. She started receiving basic piano instruction from her mother at the age of four.{{sfn|Klassen|2011}} After her mother moved out, she began taking daily one-hour lessons from her father. They included subjects such as piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and [[counterpoint]]. She then had to practice for two hours every day. Her father followed the methods in his own book, ''Wiecks pianistische Erziehung zum schönen Anschlag und zum singenden Ton'' (&quot;Wieck's Piano Education for a Delicate Touch and a Singing Sound.&quot;){{sfn|Klassen|2011}}{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.de/books?id=1bo0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3 v. 1 pp. 3–4]}} Her musical studies came largely at the expense of her broader general education, although she still studied religion and languages under her father's control of the family.{{sfn|Reich Grove|2001}}

[[File:Julius Giere - Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren (Lithographie 1835).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Lithograph of a young girl at the piano, with a hand on the keyboard but the face turned back, dressed in a festive gown|Clara Wieck, from an 1835 [[lithograph]]]]

Clara Wieck made her official debut on 28 October 1828 at the [[Gewandhaus]] in Leipzig, at age nine.{{sfn|Klassen|2011}}{{sfn|Borchard|1991|p=[https://books.google.de/books?id=kdLlCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33 33]}} The same year, she performed at the Leipzig home of Ernst Carus, director of the mental hospital at [[Colditz Castle]]. There, she met another gifted young pianist who had been invited to the musical evening, [[Robert Schumann]], who was nine years older. Schumann admired Clara's playing so much that he asked permission from his mother to stop studying law, which had never interested him much, and take music lessons with Clara's father. While taking lessons, he rented a room in the Wieck household and stayed about a year.{{sfn|Reich, Susanna|1999}}

From September 1831 to April 1832, Clara toured Paris and other European cities, accompanied by her father.{{sfn|Klassen|2011}} In [[Weimar]], she performed a bravura piece by [[Henri Herz]] for [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], who presented her with a medal with his portrait and a written note saying: &quot;For the gifted artist Clara Wieck&quot;. During that tour, the violinist [[Niccolò Paganini]], who was also in Paris, offered to appear with her.{{sfn|Braunstein|1971}} Her Paris recital was poorly attended because many people had fled the city due to an outbreak of [[cholera]].{{sfn|Braunstein|1971}} The tour marked her transition from a child prodigy to a young woman performer.{{sfn|Klassen|2011}}
{{-}}

==== Success in Vienna ====
From December 1837 to April 1838, at the age of 18, Wieck performed a series of recitals in Vienna.{{sfn|Reich Article|1986|p=249}} [[Franz Grillparzer]], Austria's leading dramatic poet, wrote a poem entitled &quot;Clara Wieck and Beethoven&quot; after hearing her perform Beethoven's ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonata during one of these recitals.{{sfn|Reich Article|1986|p=249}} She performed to sell-out crowds and laudatory critical reviews; Benedict Randhartinger, a friend of [[Franz Schubert]], gave her an autographed copy of Schubert's ''Erlkönig'', inscribing it &quot;To the celebrated artist, Clara Wieck.&quot;{{sfn|Reich Article|1986|p=249}} Chopin described her playing to [[Franz Liszt]], who came to hear one of Wieck's concerts and subsequently praised her extravagantly in a letter that was published in the Parisian ''Revue et Gazette Musicale'' and later, in translation, in the Leipzig journal ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''.{{sfn|Reich Article|1986|p=250}} On 15 March, she was named a ''Königliche und Kaiserliche Österreichische Kammer-virtuosin'' (&quot;Royal and Imperial Austrian Chamber Virtuoso&quot;),{{sfn|Nauhaus Images|2019}} Austria's highest musical honor.{{sfn|Reich Article|1986|p=250}}

An anonymous music critic, describing her Vienna recitals, said: &quot;The appearance of this artist can be regarded as epoch-making... In her creative hands, the most ordinary passage, the most routine motive acquires a significant meaning, a colour, which only those with the most consummate artistry can give.&quot;{{sfn|Burton-Hill|2017}}

=== Lasting relationships ===
==== Robert Schumann ====
[[File:Gedächtniskirche Leipzig-Schönefeld.jpg|thumb|upright|Wedding on 12 September 1840 in Leipzig-Schönefeld]]
Robert Schumann was a little more than nine years older than Wieck. In 1837, when she was 18, he proposed to her and she accepted. Robert then asked her father for her hand in marriage.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=v. 1 p. xi}} Friedrich was strongly opposed to the marriage, and refused his permission. Robert and Clara decided to go to court and sue him. The judge allowed the marriage, which took place on 12 September 1840, the day before Clara's 21st birthday, when she attained [[age of majority|majority status]].{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=v. 1 pp. xii, xvi}}{{sfn|Worl|1997}} From then on, the couple maintained a joint musical and personal diary of their life together.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=v. 1 pp. 301–03}}

In February 1854, Robert Schumann had a mental collapse, attempted suicide, and was admitted, at his request, to a [[sanatorium]] in the village of [[Endenich]] near Bonn, where he stayed for the last two years of his life. In March 1854, Brahms, Joachim, [[Albert Dietrich]], and [[Julius Otto Grimm]] spent time with Clara Schumann, playing music for her and with her to divert her mind from the tragedy.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT61 v. 2 pp. 61–62, 69, 71]}} Brahms composed some private piano pieces for her to console her: four piano pieces and a set of [[Variation (music)|variations]] on a [[Theme (music)|theme]] by Robert Schumann that she had also written variations on a year earlier, as her [[Opus number|Op.]] 20. The music by Brahms was not intended to be published, but for her alone. Brahms later thought to publish them anonymously, but eventually they were issued as his four [[Ballades, Op. 10 (Brahms)|Ballades, Op. 10]], and ''[[Variations on a Theme by Robert Schumann]]'', Op. 9. Brahms dedicated the variations to both Schumanns, hoping that Robert would be released soon and rejoined with his family.{{sfn|Horne|1997|pp=98–115}}

For the entire two years of Robert Schumann's stay at the institution, his wife was not permitted to visit him, while Brahms visited him regularly. When it was apparent that Robert was near death, she was finally admitted to see him. He appeared to recognize her, but could only speak a few words.{{sfn|Daverio Grove|2001|p=20}} Robert Schumann died two days later, on 29 July 1856.{{sfn|Abraham|1998}}

==== Joseph Joachim ====
The Schumanns first met violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] in November 1844, when he was 14 years old.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=v. 1 p. 366}} A year later Clara Schumann wrote in her diary that in a concert on 11 November 1845, &quot;little Joachim was very much liked. He played a new violin concerto by [[Felix Mendelssohn]], which is said to be wonderful.&quot;{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT388 v. 2 p. 388]}} In May 1853 they heard Joachim play the solo part in Beethoven's [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]]. She wrote that he played &quot;with a finish, a depth of poetic feeling, his whole soul in every note, so ideally, that I have never heard violin-playing like it, and I can truly say that I have never received so indelible an impression from any virtuoso.&quot; A lasting friendship developed between Clara and Joseph, which for more than forty years never failed her in things great or small, never wavered in its loyalty.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT41 v. 2 p. 41]}}

Over her career, Schumann gave over 238 concerts with Joachim in Germany and Britain, more than with any other artist.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|p=206}} The two were particularly noted for their playing of [[Beethoven's violin sonatas]].{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|p=207}}

==== Johannes Brahms ====

In early 1853, the then-unknown 20-year-old [[Johannes Brahms]] met Joachim and made a very favorable impression. Brahms received from him a letter of introduction to Robert Schumann, and thus presented himself at the Schumanns' home in Düsseldorf. Brahms played some of his piano solo compositions for the Schumanns, and they were deeply impressed.{{sfn|Litzmann Letters|1927}} Robert published an article highly lauding Brahms, and Clara wrote in the diary that Brahms &quot;seemed as if sent straight from God&quot;.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT42 v. 2 p. 42]}}

During Robert Schumann's last years, confined to an asylum, Brahms was a strong presence for the Schumann family.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001}} His letters indicate his strong feelings for Clara.{{sfn|Swafford Article|2003}} Their relationship has been interpreted as somewhere between friendship and love,{{sfn|Popova|2017}} and Brahms always maintained the utmost respect for her, as a woman and a talented musician.{{sfn|Swafford Article|2003}}

Brahms played his [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|First Symphony]] for her before its premiere. She gave some advice about the Adagio, which he took to heart. She expressed her appreciation of the Symphony as a whole, but mentioned her dissatisfaction with the endings of the third and fourth movements.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=v. 1 pp. 322–23}} She was the first to perform many of his works in public, including the ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel]]'', a solo piano work written by Brahms in 1861.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT201 v. 2 p. 201]}}

=== Concert tours ===
Clara Schumann first toured England in April 1856, while her husband was still living but unable to travel. She was invited to play in a [[Royal Philharmonic Society|London Philharmonic Society]]{{efn|The ''Philharmonic Society of London'' had been formed in 1813. In 1912, it became the ''Royal Philharmonic Society''.}} concert by conductor [[William Sterndale Bennett]], a good friend of Robert's.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131 v. 2 p. 131]}} She was displeased with the little time spent on rehearsals: &quot;They call it a rehearsal here if a piece is played through once.&quot; She wrote that musical &quot;artists&quot; in England &quot;allow themselves to be treated as inferiors.&quot;{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT133 v. 2 p. 133]}} She was happy, though, to hear the cellist [[Carlo Alfredo Piatti|Alfredo Piatti]] play with &quot;a tone, a bravura, a certainty, such as I never heard before&quot;. In May 1856, she played Schumann's [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor]] with the [[New Philharmonic Society]]{{efn|The New Philharmonic Society began operating in 1852 with Dr. Wylde as co-founder: ''A Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', Ed. George Grove, vol. 2, 1900, MacMillan, London, in Wikisource; article ''New Philharmonic Society, The'' by George Grove. The New Philharmonic ceased giving concerts in June 1879.}} conducted by Dr Wylde, who as she said had &quot;led a dreadful rehearsal&quot; and &quot;could not grasp the rhythm of the last movement&quot;.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT133 v. 2 p. 133]}} Still, she returned to London the following year and continued to perform in Britain for the next 15 years.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|p=267}}

In October–November 1857, Schumann and Joachim went on a recital tour to Dresden and Leipzig.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT3152 v. 2 p. 152]}} [[St. James's Hall]] in London, which opened in 1858, hosted a series of &quot;Popular Concerts&quot; of chamber music.{{efn|Some printed programs have been preserved in Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council ''Concert Programmes'', St. James's Hall Concerts (1867–1904)}} Joachim visited London annually beginning in 1866.{{sfn|Avins Article|2002|p=637}} Schumann also spent many years in London participating in the Popular Concerts with Joachim and the celebrated Italian cellist [[Carlo Alfredo Piatti]]. Second violinist [[Joseph Ries]] (brother of composer Ferdinand Ries) and violist [[J. B. Zerbini]] usually played on the same concert programs. [[George Bernard Shaw]], the leading playwright and also a music critic, wrote that the Popular Concerts helped greatly to spread and enlighten musical taste in England.{{sfn|Shaw|1937|p=297}}

In January 1867, Schumann toured [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]], Scotland, along with Joachim, Piatti, Ries, and Zerbini. Two sisters, [[Louisa Pyne|Louisa and Susanna Pyne]], singers and managers of an opera company in England, and a man named Saunders, made all the arrangements. She was accompanied by her oldest daughter Marie, who wrote from Manchester to her friend Rosalie Leser that in Edinburgh the pianist &quot;was received with tempestuous applause and had to give an encore, so had Joachim. Piatti, too, is always tremendously liked.&quot;{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT249 v. 2 pp. 249–50]}} Marie also wrote: &quot;For the longer journeys we had a saloon [car], comfortably furnished with arm-chairs and sofas... the journey ... was very comfortable.&quot; On this occasion, the musicians were not &quot;treated as inferiors&quot;.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.de/books?id=JbY0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250 v. 2 p. 250]}}

=== Later life ===
==== Concerts ====
Schumann still performed actively in the 1870s and 1880s. She performed extensively and regularly throughout Germany during these decades, and had engagements in Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Holland, and Switzerland. When in Basel, Switzerland, she often stayed with the [[Von der Mühll]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Basel 1857 - 1887 - Schumann-Portal|url=https://www.schumann-portal.de/basel-1857-1887.html|access-date=2020-08-28|website=www.schumann-portal.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued her annual winter-spring concert tours of England, giving 16 of them between 1865 and 1888, often with violinist Joachim.{{sfn|Schumann Portal|2019}}

She took a break from concert performances, beginning in January 1874, cancelling her usual England tour due to an arm injury. In July she consulted a doctor, who having massaged the arm, advised her to practice for only one hour a day.{{sfn|Altenmüller|Kopiez|2010|pp=101–18}} She rested for the remainder of the year before returning to the concert stage in March 1875.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=v. 1 pp. 322–23}} She had not fully recovered, and experienced more [[neuralgia]] in her arm again in May, reporting that she &quot;could not write on account of my arm&quot;.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=v. 1 pp. 322–23}} By October 1875, she had recovered enough to begin another tour in Germany.

In addition to solo piano recitals, chamber music, and accompanying singers, she continued to perform frequently with orchestras. In 1877 she performed Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Piano Concerto]] in Berlin, with [[Woldemar Bargiel]] conducting, her half-brother by her mother's second marriage, and had tremendous success.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT42 v. 2 p. 42]}}{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=v. 1 pp. 322–23}} In 1883, she performed Beethoven's ''[[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]]'' with the newly-formed [[Berlin Philharmonic]], and was enthusiastically celebrated, although she was playing with an injured hand in great pain, having fallen on a staircase the previous day.{{sfn|Berliner Philharmoniker|2019}} Later that year she played Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]] (with her own cadenzas) with Joachim conducting the same orchestra, again to great acclaim.

In 1885, Schumann once again joined Joachim conducting Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto in D minor]], again playing her own cadenzas. The following day, she played her husband's Piano Concerto with Bargiel conducting. &quot;I think I played fresher than ever&quot;, she wrote to Brahms, &quot;What I liked very much about the concert was that I was able to give Woldemar the direction of it, who had longed for such an opportunity for years.&quot;{{sfn|Berliner Philharmoniker|2019}}

She played her last public concert in Frankfurt on 12 March 1891. The last work she played was Brahms's ''[[Variations on a Theme by Haydn]]'', in a version for two pianos, with [[James Kwast]].{{sfn|Clive|2006|p=403}}

==== Teaching ====
[[File:Frankfurt Saalhof um 1900.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photograph of a large city building on the corner of a block, with conical towers on that corner|Saalhof, the first location of [[Hoch Conservatory|Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium]]]]

In 1878, Schumann was appointed the first piano teacher of the new [[Hoch Conservatory|Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium]] in Frankfurt.{{sfn|Riebsamen|2019}}{{sfn|Negwer|2002}} She had chosen Frankfurt among offers from Stuttgart, Hannover, and Berlin, because the director, [[Joachim Raff]], had accepted her conditions: she could not teach more than 1-1/2 hours per day, was free to teach at her home, and had four months of vacation and time off for short tours in winter. She demanded two assistants, with her daughters Marie and Eugenie in mind.{{sfn|Klassen|2011}}{{sfn|Riebsamen|2019}}{{sfn|Allihn|2019}}

She was the only woman on the faculty.{{sfn|Riebsamen|2019}} Her fame attracted students from abroad, including Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001}} She trained only advanced pupils, mostly young women, while her two daughters gave lessons to beginners. Among her 68 known students who made a musical career were [[Natalia Janotha]], [[Fanny Davies]], [[Nanette Falk]], [[Amina Goodwin]], [[Carl Friedberg]], [[Leonard Borwick]], [[Ilona Eibenschütz]], [[Adelina de Lara]], [[Marie Olson]], and [[Mary Wurm]].{{sfn|Klassen|2011}}{{sfn|Riebsamen|2019}}{{sfn|Allihn|2019}} The Konservatorium held events to celebrate her 50th year on stage in 1878 and her 60th career anniversary ten years later.{{sfn|Klassen|2011}}{{sfn|Allihn|2019}} She held the teaching post until 1892 and contributed greatly to the improvement of modern piano playing technique.{{sfn|Klassen|2011}}{{sfn|Riebsamen|2019}}

=== Death ===
Schumann suffered a stroke on 26 March 1896, and died on 20 May at age 76.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|p=23}} She was buried in Bonn at [[Alter Friedhof, Bonn|Alter Friedhof]] next to her husband, according to her own wish.{{sfn|Allihn|2019}}

== Family life ==
Robert Schumann gave his wife a diary on their wedding day. His first entry indicates that it should act as an autobiography of the family's personal lives, especially of the couple, and of their desires and accomplishments in the arts. It also functioned as a record of their artistic endeavors and growth. She fully accepted the arrangement of a shared diary as evidenced by her many entries. It demonstrates her loyal love for her husband, with a desire to combine two lives into one artistically, although this life-long goal involved risks.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yit8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT201 v. 2 p. 201]}}

The couple remained joint partners in both family life and their careers. She premiered many of his works, from solo piano works to [[List of compositions by Clara Schumann#Arrangements|her own piano versions of his orchestral works]].{{sfn|Reich Grove|2001}}

She often took charge of finances and general household affairs. Part of her responsibility included earning money by giving concerts, though she continued to play throughout her life, not just for the income but because she was an artist by training and nature. The burden of family duties increased over time and narrowed her ability as an artist. As a flourishing composer's wife, she was limited in her own explorations.{{sfn|Litzmann Bio|1913|loc=v. 1 p. 306}}

She was the main breadwinner for her family and the sole one after her husband was hospitalized and then died. She gave concerts and taught, and she did most of the work of organizing her own concert tours.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001}} She hired a housekeeper and a cook to keep house while she was away on her long tours.{{sfn|Galloway|2002}}&lt;!-- She refused to accept charity when a group of musicians offered to put on a benefit concert for her.--&gt;

Clara and Robert Schumann had eight children:{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|pp=162–77}}
* Marie (1841–1929)
* Elise (1843–1928)
* Julie (1845–1872)
* Emil (1846–1847)
* Ludwig (1848–1899)
* Ferdinand (1849–1891)
* [[Eugenie Schumann|Eugenie]] (1851–1938)
* Felix (1854–1879).

Her life was punctuated by tragedy. Her husband was permanently institutionalized after a mental collapse. Her eldest living son Ludwig suffered from mental illness like his father and, in her words, eventually had to be &quot;buried alive&quot; in an institution. She became deaf in later life, and she often needed a wheelchair.{{sfn|Braunstein|1971}} Not only did her husband predecease her, but also four of their children.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001}} Their first son, Emil, died in 1847, aged only 1.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|p=170}} Their daughter Julie died in 1872, leaving two small children aged only 2 and 7, then raised by their grandmother.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|p=169}} In 1879, their son Felix died aged 24.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|p=158}} In 1891, their son Ferdinand died at the age of 41, leaving his children to her care.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001|p=152}}

Their oldest child Marie was of great support and help to her mother, taking the position of household cook. Marie also dissuaded her mother from continuing to burn letters that she had received from Brahms which he had asked her to destroy. Another daughter, Eugenie, who had been too young when her father died to remember him, wrote a book, ''Erinnerungen'' (Memoirs), published in 1925, covering her parents and Brahms.{{sfn|Nauhaus Eugenie|2019}}{{sfn|Schumann, Eugenie|1925}}

Schumann famously rescued her children from violence during the [[May Uprising in Dresden]] in 1849. On the evening of 3 May, Robert and Clara heard that the revolution against King [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] for not accepting the &quot;constitution for a German Confederation&quot; had arrived in Dresden. Most family members left and hid in a &quot;neighbourhood security brigade&quot;, but on 7 May, she bravely walked back to Dresden to rescue her three children who had been left with a maid,{{sfn|Daverio Article|1997}} defying a pack of armed men who confronted her, then walked back out of the city through the dangerous areas again.

== Music ==
=== Performance repertoire ===
During her lifetime, Schumann was an internationally renowned concert pianist.{{sfn|Weingarten|1972|p=96}} Over 1,300 concert programs from her performances throughout Europe between 1831 through 1889 have been preserved.{{sfn|Kopiez|2008|pp=50–73}} She championed the works of her husband and other contemporaries such as Brahms, Chopin and Mendelssohn.{{sfn|Kopiez|2008|pp=50–73}}

The Schumanns were admirers of Chopin, especially of ''[[Variations on &quot;Là ci darem la mano&quot; (Chopin)|Variations on &quot;Là ci darem la mano&quot;]]'', and she played the piece herself. When she was 14 and her future husband 23, he wrote to her:
{{quote|text=Tomorrow precisely at eleven o'clock I will play the adagio from Chopin's Variations and at the same time I shall think of you very intently, exclusively of you. Now my request is that you should do the same, so that we may see and meet each other in spirit.|author=Robert Schumann{{sfn|Jensen|2012|p=79}}}}

In her early years, her repertoire, selected by her father, was showy and in the style common to the time, with works by [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]], [[Adolf von Henselt]], [[Sigismond Thalberg]], [[Henri Herz]], [[Johann Peter Pixis]], [[Carl Czerny]] and her own compositions. She turned to including compositions by Baroque composers such as [[Domenico Scarlatti]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], but performed especially contemporary music by Chopin, Mendelssohn and her husband, whose music did not attain popularity until the 1850s.{{sfn|Klassen|2011}}

In 1835, she performed her [[Piano Concerto (Clara Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor]] with the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]], conducted by Mendelssohn. On 4 December 1845, she premiered Robert Schumann's [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto]] in Dresden.{{sfn|Schwarm|2013}} Following the advice of Brahms she performed Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 24 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto in C minor]] at the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian court]]{{sfn|Nauhaus Images|2019}} and in Leipzig.{{sfn|Avins Book|1997|p=231}} Her busiest years as a performer were between 1856 and 1873, after her husband's death.{{sfn|Kopiez|2008|pp=50–73}} During this period, she experienced success as a performer in Britain, where her 1865 performance of Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto in G major]] was met with enormous applause. As a chamber musician, she often gave concerts with violinist Joachim. In her later career, she frequently accompanied [[lied]]er singers in recitals.{{sfn|Kopiez|2008|pp=50–73}}

{{See also|List of compositions by Clara Schumann}}
As part of the broad musical education given to her by her father, Clara Wieck learned to compose, and from childhood to middle age she produced a good body of work. Clara wrote that &quot;composing gives me great pleasure... there is nothing that surpasses the joy of creation, if only because through it one wins hours of self-forgetfulness, when one lives in a world of sound&quot;. Her Op. 1 was ''[[4 Polonaises (Clara Schumann)|Quatre Polonaises pour le pianoforte]]'' composed in 1831, and Op. 5 ''[[4 Pièces caractéristiques (Clara Schumann)|4 Pièces caractéristiques]]'' in 1836, all piano pieces for her recitals. She wrote her [[Piano Concerto (Clara Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor]] at age 14, with some help from her future husband.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001}} She planned a second piano concerto, but only a ''Konzertsatz'' in F minor from 1847 survived.{{sfn|Reich Book|2001}}

After her marriage, she turned to lieder and choral works. The couple wrote and published one joint composition in 1841, setting a cycle of poems by [[Friedrich Rückert]] called ''Liebesfrühling'' (''Spring of Love'') in ''Zwölf Lieder auf F. Rückerts Liebesfrühling'', her Op. 12 and his Op. 37.{{sfn|Klassen|2011}} Her chamber works include the [[Piano Trio (Clara Schumann)|Piano Trio in G minor]], Op. 17 (1846) and [[Three Romances for Violin and Piano]], Op. 22 (1853), inspired by her husband's birthday. They were dedicated to Joachim, who performed them for [[George V of Hanover]], who declared them a &quot;marvellous, heavenly pleasure&quot;.{{sfn|Dunsmore|2013}}{{sfn|Clara Schumann Score|2001}}

As she grew older, she became more preoccupied with other responsibilities in life and found it hard to compose regularly, writing, &quot;I once believed that I possessed creative talent, but I have given up this idea; a woman must not desire to compose&amp;nbsp;– there has never yet been one able to do it. Should I expect to be the one?&quot;{{sfn|Savage|2017}} Her husband also expressed concern about the effect on her composing output:

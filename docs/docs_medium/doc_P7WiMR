==History==

[[File:Lithuanian Statute I.jpg|thumb|The first [[Statutes of Lithuania|Lithuanian statute]] of 1529, in Belarusian]]

The modern Belarusian language was redeveloped on the base of the [[vernacular]] spoken remnants of the [[Ruthenian language]], surviving in the ethnic Belarusian territories in the 19th century. The end of the 18th century (the times of the [[Partitions of Poland|Divisions of Commonwealth]]) is the usual conventional borderline between the [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and Modern Belarusian stages of development.

By the end of the 18th century, (Old) Belarusian was still common among the minor nobility in eastern part, in the territory of present-day Belarus, of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (hereafter GDL). [[Jan Czeczot]] in the 1840s had mentioned that even his generation's grandfathers preferred speaking (Old) Belarusian.&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XVII Sec.1&lt;/ref&gt; According to A. N. Pypin, the Belarusian language was spoken in some areas among the minor nobility during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[Turuk 1921], p.10&lt;/ref&gt; In its vernacular form, it was the language of the smaller town dwellers and of the peasantry and it had been the language of oral folklore. Teaching in Belarusian was conducted mainly in schools run by the [[Order of Saint Basil the Great|Basilian order]].

The development of Belarusian in the 19th century was strongly influenced by the political conflict in the territories of the former GDL, between the Russian Imperial authorities, trying to consolidate their rule over the &quot;joined provinces&quot;, and the Polish and Polonised nobility, trying to bring back its [[partitions of Poland|pre-Partitions]] rule&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XXII Sec.1 p.507&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Polonization#Partitions|Polonization in times of Partitions]]).

[[File:Biblia Ruska.jpg|thumb|left|The Bible by [[Francysk Skaryna]] in Belarusian, 16th century]] One of the important manifestations of this conflict was the struggle for ideological control over the educational system. The Polish and Russian languages were being introduced and re-introduced, while the general state of the people's education remained poor until the very end of the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XV Sect. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the first two decades of the 19th century had seen the unprecedented prosperity of Polish culture and language in the former GDL lands, and had prepared the era of such famous &quot;Belarusians by birth – Poles by choice,&quot; as [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]] and [[Władysław Syrokomla|Syrokomla]]. The era had seen the effective completion of the Polonization of the lowest level of the nobility, the further reduction of the area of use of contemporary Belarusian, and the effective folklorization of Belarusian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Per (Dovnar 1926), (Smalyanchuk 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Due both to the state of the people's education and to the strong positions of Polish and Polonized nobility, it was only after the 1880s–1890s that the educated Belarusian element, still shunned because of &quot;peasant origin&quot;, began to appear in state offices.&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XV Sect. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--=== Grammar in 19th century ===--&gt;
&lt;!--There was a grammar of Belarusian language (using Cyrillic alphabet) prepared by bishop ... By the early 2000s the manuscript for it had not yet been found. (Smalyanchuk 2001)--&gt;
In 1846, ethnographer Pavel Shpilevskiy prepared a Belarusian grammar (using the Cyrillic alphabet) on the basis of the folk dialects of the [[Minsk]] region. However, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] refused to print his submission, on the basis that it had not been prepared in a sufficiently scientific manner.&lt;!-- other efforts, Tsyotka, chytanki --&gt;

From the mid-1830s ethnographic works began to appear, and tentative attempts to study the language were instigated (e.g. Shpilevskiy's grammar). The Belarusian literary tradition began to re-form, based on the folk language, initiated by the works of [[Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich]]. ''See also'': [[Jan Czeczot]], [[Jan Barszczewski]].&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926]. Ch. XV. Sect.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 1860s, both the Russian and Polish parties in Belarusian lands had begun to realise that the decisive role in the [[January Uprising|upcoming conflicts]] was shifting to the peasantry, overwhelmingly Belarusian. So a large amount of propaganda appeared, targeted at the peasantry and written in Belarusian;&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XV Sect. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; notably, the anti-Russian, anti-Tsarist, [[anti-Eastern Orthodox]] &quot;Manifesto&quot; and the newspaper &quot;Peasants' Truth&quot; (1862–1863) by [[Konstanty Kalinowski|Kalinowski]], and anti-Polish, anti-Revolutionary, pro-Orthodox booklets and poems (1862).&lt;ref&gt;[Turuk 1921], p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of the all-Russian &quot;narodniki&quot; and Belarusian national movements (late 1870s–early 1880s) renewed interest in the Belarusian language (See also: [[Homan (1884)]], [[Francishak Bahushevich|Bahushevich]], [[Yefim Karskiy]], [[Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapol'skiy|Dovnar-Zapol'skiy]], Bessonov, Pypin, Sheyn, Nosovich). The Belarusian literary tradition was also renewed (''see also'': [[Francishak Bahushevich|F. Bahushevich]]). It was in these times that F. Bahushevich made his famous appeal to Belarusians: &quot;Do not forsake our language, lest you pass away&quot; ({{lang-be|Не пакідайце ж мовы нашай, каб не ўмёрлі|links=no}}).

In course of the 1897 [[Russian Empire Census]], about 5.89&amp;nbsp;million people declared themselves speakers of Belarusian.

The end of the 19th century, however, still showed that the urban language of Belarusian towns remained either Polish or Russian. The same census showed that towns with a population greater than 50,000 had fewer than a tenth Belarusian speakers. This state of affairs greatly contributed to a perception that Belarusian was a &quot;rural&quot; and &quot;uneducated&quot; language.

However, the census was a major breakthrough for the first steps of the Belarusian national self-awareness and identity, since it clearly showed to the Imperial authorities and the still-strong Polish minority that the population and the language were neither Polish nor Russian.

=== 1900s–1910s ===
The rising influence of Socialist ideas advanced the emancipation of the Belarusian language still further (''see also:'' [[Belarusian Socialist Assembly]], [[Circle of Belarusian People's Education and Belarusian Culture]], [[Belarusian Socialist Lot]], [[Socialist Party &quot;White Russia&quot;]], [[Alaiza Pashkievich]], [[Nasha Dolya]]). The fundamental works of [[Yefim Karskiy]] marked a turning point in the scientific perception of Belarusian. The ban on publishing books and papers in Belarusian was officially removed (25 December 1904). The unprecedented surge of national feeling in the 20th century, especially among the workers and peasants, particularly after the events of 1905,&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XXI Sec.4 p.480-481&lt;/ref&gt; gave momentum to the intensive development of Belarusian literature and press (See also: [[Naša niva]], [[Yanka Kupala]], [[Yakub Kolas]]).

==== Grammar ====
During the 19th and early 20th century, there was no normative Belarusian grammar. Authors wrote as they saw fit, usually representing the particularities of different Belarusian dialects. The scientific groundwork for the introduction of a truly scientific and modern grammar of the Belarusian language was laid down by the linguist [[Yefim Karskiy]].

By the early 1910s, the continuing lack of a codified Belarusian grammar was becoming intolerably obstructive in the opinion of uniformitarian prescriptivists. Then Russian academician [[Aleksey Shakhmatov|Shakhmatov]], chair of the Russian language and literature department of St. Petersburg University, approached the board of the Belarusian newspaper ''[[Naša niva]]'' with a proposal that a Belarusian linguist be trained under his supervision in order to be able to create documentation of the grammar. Initially, the famous Belarusian poet [[Maksim Bahdanovich]] was to be entrusted with this work. However, Bahdanovich's poor health (tuberculosis) precluded his living in the climate of St. Petersburg, so [[Branislaw Tarashkyevich]], a fresh graduate of the [[Vilnya Liceum No. 2]], was selected for the task.

In the Belarusian community, great interest was vested in this enterprise. The already famous Belarusian poet [[Yanka Kupala]], in his letter to Tarashkyevich, urged him to &quot;hurry with his much-needed work&quot;. Tarashkyevich had been working on the preparation of the grammar during 1912–1917, with the help and supervision of Shakhmatov and Karskiy. Tarashkyevich had completed the work by the autumn of 1917, even moving from the tumultuous Petrograd of 1917 to the relative calm of Finland in order to be able to complete it uninterrupted. &lt;!-- Lyosik --&gt;

By the summer of 1918, it became obvious that there were insurmountable problems with the printing of Tarashkyevich's grammar in Petrograd: a lack of paper, type and qualified personnel. Meanwhile, his grammar had apparently been planned to be adopted in the workers' and peasants' schools of Belarus that were to be set up,&lt;!-- ref to decrees --&gt; so Tarashkyevich was permitted to print his book abroad. &lt;!-- by who? ref? --&gt; In June 1918, he arrived in &lt;!-- then occupied by who --&gt;[[Vilnius]], via Finland. The [[Belarusian Committee]] petitioned the administration to allow the book to be printed. Finally, the first edition of the &quot;Belarusian grammar for schools&quot; was printed ([[Vilnius|Vil'nya]], 1918).

There existed at least two other contemporary attempts at codifying the Belarusian grammar.&lt;!-- ref to Lyosik --&gt; In 1915, Rev. [[Balyaslaw Pachopka]] had prepared a Belarusian grammar using the Latin script. Belarusian linguist S. M. [[Stepan Nyekrashevich|Nyekrashevich]] considered Pachopka's grammar unscientific and ignorant of the principles of the language.&lt;!-- reference! political? --&gt; But Pachopka's grammar was reportedly taught in an unidentified number of schools, from 1918 for an unspecified period. Another grammar was supposedly jointly prepared by A. Lutskyevich and Ya. Stankyevich, and differed from Tarashkyevich's grammar somewhat in the resolution of some key aspects.&lt;!-- refs Lyosik, stankyevich--&gt;&lt;!-- critics by Stankyevich?? --&gt;&lt;!-- yet another grammars: Lyosik, Stankyevich, 5ed, 8ed, 2005 --&gt;

=== 1914–1917 ===
On 22 December 1915, [[Paul von Hindenburg]] issued an order on schooling in German Army-occupied territories in the [[Russian Empire]] ([[Ober Ost]]), banning schooling in [[Russian language|Russian]] and including the Belarusian language in an exclusive list of four languages made mandatory in the respective native schooling systems (Belarusian, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Yiddish]]). School attendance was not made mandatory, though. Passports at this time were bilingual, in [[German language|German]] and in one of the &quot;native languages&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Turonek 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Also at this time, Belarusian preparatory schools, printing houses, press organs were opened (''see also:'' [[Homan (1916)]]).

=== 1917–1920 ===
After the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, the Belarusian language became an important factor in political activities in the Belarusian lands (''see also:'' [[Central Council of Belarusian Organisations]], [[Great Belarusian Council]], [[First All-Belarusian Congress]], [[Belnatskom]]). In the [[Belarusian People's Republic]], Belarusian was used as the only official language (decreed by Belarusian People's Secretariat on 28 April 1918). Subsequently, in the [[Belarusian SSR]], Belarusian was decreed to be one of the four (Belarusian, Polish, Russian, and Yiddish) official languages (decreed by Central Executive Committee of BSSR in February 1921).

=== 1920–1930 ===

==== Soviet Belarus ====

A decree of 15 July 1924 confirmed that the Belarusian, Russian, Yiddish and Polish languages had equal status in Soviet Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;Gennady Estraikh: ''Soviet Yiddish. Language Planning and Linguistic Development.'' Oxford: Clarendon, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the BSSR, Tarashkyevich's grammar had been officially accepted for use in state schooling after its re-publication in unchanged form, first in 1922 by [[Yazep Lyosik]] under his own name as ''Practical grammar. Part I'', then in 1923 by the Belarusian State Publishing House under the title ''Belarusian language. Grammar. Ed. I. 1923'', also by &quot;Ya. Lyosik&quot;.

In 1925, Lyosik added two new chapters, addressing the orthography of compound words and partly modifying the orthography of assimilated words. From this point on, Belarusian grammar had been popularized and taught in the educational system in that form. The ambiguous and insufficient development of several components of Tarashkyevich's grammar was perceived to be the cause of some problems in practical usage, and this led to discontent with the grammar.

In 1924–25, Lyosik and his brother Anton Lyosik prepared and published their project of orthographic reform, proposing a number of radical changes. A fully [[phonetic orthography]] was introduced. One of the most distinctive changes brought in was the principle of [[akanye]] ({{lang-be|́аканне|links=no}}), wherein unstressed &quot;o&quot;, pronounced in both Russian and Belarusian as /a/, is written as &quot;а&quot;.

The Belarusian Academic Conference on Reform of the Orthography and Alphabet was convened in 1926. After discussions on the project, the Conference made resolutions on some of the problems. However, the Lyosik brothers' project had not addressed all the problematic issues, so the Conference was not able to address all of those.

As the outcome of the conference, the Orthographic Commission was created to prepare the project of the actual reform. This was instigated on 1 October 1927, headed by S. Nyekrashevich, with the following principal guidelines of its work adopted:
* To consider the resolutions of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926) non-mandatory, although highly competent material.
* To simplify Tarashkyevich's grammar where it was ambiguous or difficult in use, to amend it where it was insufficiently developed (e.g., orthography of assimilated words), and to create new rules if absent (orthography of proper names and geographical names).

During its work in 1927–29, the Commission had actually prepared the project for spelling reform. The resulting project had included both completely new rules and existing rules in unchanged and changed forms, some of the changes being the work of the Commission itself, and others resulting from the resolutions of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926), re-approved by the Commission.

Notably, the use of the ''Ь'' (soft sign) before the combinations &quot;consonant+iotified vowel&quot; (&quot;softened consonants&quot;), which had been previously denounced as highly redundant (e.g., in the proceedings of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926)), was cancelled. However, the complete resolution of the highly important issue of the orthography of unstressed ''Е'' (''IE'') was not achieved.

Both the resolutions of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926) and the project of the Orthographic Commission (1930) caused much disagreement in the Belarusian academic environment. Several elements of the project were to be put under appeal in the &quot;higher (political) bodies of power&quot;.

==== West Belarus ====
In [[West Belarus]], under Polish rule, the Belarusian language was at a disadvantage. Schooling in the Belarusian language was obstructed, and printing in Belarusian experienced political oppression.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.translationdirectory.com/articles/article2513.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The prestige of the Belarusian language in the Western Belarus during the period hinged significantly on the image of the BSSR being the &quot;true Belarusian home&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(words of V. Lastouski)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=April 2011}} This image, however, was strongly disrupted by the [[Soviet repressions in Belarus|&quot;purges&quot; of &quot;national-democrats&quot; in BSSR]] (1929–30) and by the subsequent grammar reform (1933).

Tarashkyevich's grammar was re-published five times in Western Belarus. However, the 5th edition (1929) (reprinted verbatim in Belarus in 1991 and often referred to) was the version diverging from the previously published one, which Tarashkyevich had prepared disregarding the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926) resolutions. {{harv|Тарашкевіч|1991|loc=Foreword}}

===1930s===

====Soviet Belarus====

In 1929–30, the Communist authorities of Soviet Belarus made a series of drastic crackdowns against the supposed &quot;national-democratic counter-revolution&quot; (informally &quot;nats-dems&quot; ({{lang-be|нац-дэмы|links=no}})). Effectively, entire generations of Socialist Belarusian national activists in the first quarter of the 20th century were wiped out of political, scientific and social existence. Only the most famous cult figures (e.g. [[Yanka Kupala]]) were spared.

However, a new power group in Belarusian science quickly formed during these power shifts, under the virtual leadership of the Head of the Philosophy Institute of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, academician S. Ya. Vol’fson ({{lang|be|С. Я. Вольфсон}}). The book published under his editorship, ''Science in Service of Nats-Dems’ Counter-Revolution'' (1931), represented the new spirit of political life in Soviet Belarus.

====1933 reform of Belarusian grammar====
The Reform of Belarusian Grammar (1933) had been brought out quite unexpectedly, supposedly [Stank 1936],  with the project published in the central newspaper of the Belarusian Communist Party (''[[Zviazda]])'' on 1933-06-28 and the decree of the Council of People's Commissars (Council of Ministers) of BSSR issued on 1933-08-28, to gain the status of law on 1933-09-16.

There had been some post-facto speculations, too, that the 1930 project of the reform (as prepared by people who were no longer seen as politically &quot;clean&quot;), had been given for the &quot;purification&quot; to the &quot;nats-dems&quot; competition in the Academy of Sciences, which would explain the &quot;block&quot; nature of the differences between the 1930 and 1933 versions. Peculiarly, [[Yan Stankyevich]] in his notable critique of the reform [Stank 1936] failed to mention the 1930 project, dating the reform project to 1932.
&lt;!-- resume here --&gt;
The reform resulted in the grammar officially used, with further amendments, in [[Byelorussian SSR]] and modern [[Belarus]]. Sometimes this grammar is called the ''official'' grammar of the Belarusian language, to distinguish it from the ''pre-reform'' grammar, known as the ''classic'' grammar or [[Taraškievica]] (Tarashkevitsa). It is also known as ''narkamauka'', after the word ''narkamat'', a Belarusian abbreviation for [[People's Commissariat]] (ministry). The latter term bears a derogatory connotation.

The officially announced causes for the reform were:
* The pre-1933 grammar was maintaining artificial barriers between the Russian and Belarusian languages.
* The reform was to cancel the influences of the Polonisation corrupting the Belarusian language.
* The reform was to remove the [[archaism]]s, [[neologism]]s and vulgarisms supposedly introduced by the &quot;national-democrats&quot;.
* The reform was to simplify the grammar of the Belarusian language.

The reform had been accompanied by a fervent press campaign directed against the &quot;nats-dems not yet giving up.&quot;

The decree had been named ''On Changing and Simplifying Belarusian Spelling'' ({{lang|be|«Аб зменах і спрашчэнні беларускага правапісу»}}), but the bulk of the changes had been introduced into the grammar. [[Yan Stankyevich]] in his critique of the reform talked about 25 changes, with one of them being strictly orthographical and 24 relating to both orthography and grammar. [Stank 1936]

Many of the changes in the orthography proper (&quot;stronger principle of AH-ing,&quot; &quot;no redundant soft sign,&quot; &quot;uniform ''nye'' and ''byez''&quot;) were, in fact, simply implementations of earlier proposals made by people who had subsequently suffered political suppression (e.g., Yazep Lyosik, Lastowski, Nyekrashevich, 1930 project).&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=Да рэформы беларускага правапісу |title=Пасяджэньні Беларускае Акадэмічнае Конфэрэнцыі па рэформе правапісу і азбукі |place=Мн.: [б. м.] |year=1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ян Станкевіч.

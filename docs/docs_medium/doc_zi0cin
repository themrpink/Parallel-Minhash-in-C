'''First hit doesn't show login, all subsequent hits do'''

2002/03/28: When I enter Wikipedia from outside the page shows my IP instead of my username.  When I follow a link within Wikipedia the cookie is noticed and my login name appears.  I obviously have cookies set and working, since it does notice.  I use Mozilla 0.9.9 and Galeon 1.2 on Linux.  I'd like to enter to the Recent Changes page, but since the first page doesn't recognise my cookie, it only displays 50 entries and not the number I have indicated in my preferences. -- [[user:Seindal|Seindal]]

:This might be a Mozilla issue as well.  NS4.77 did the initial login right.
:IE 6.0.260 for WinNT has the same problem.  [[user:Koyaanis Qatsi|Koyaanis Qatsi]]
:Internet Explorer 5 for Macintosh has the same problem, and so does Netscape 4.76.  [[user:Dreamyshade|Dreamyshade]]

:This might be related to &quot;Log in doesn't set cookie path&quot; below. If the first page is http://www.wikipedia.com/, then this doesn't get the cookie; I've set my first page to http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/ to get around this, and the first page ''does'' show my login name. --[[user:Carey Evans|Carey Evans]]

::This is it!  I inspected the cookie and it has a path component of /wiki.  A workaround for individual users is to change the entry point to /wiki, but a general solution would be to have the top page redirect to /wiki/, thus bringing the user within the realm of the cookie. -- [[user:Seindal|Seindal]]

'''I can't log in.'''

2002/03/22:  I set no password under UseMod, now I can't log in under the new PHP script.  I'm still logged on on one computer by a cookie, but I can't log on from any other computer, without a password.  I also am unable to change my password from the computer I am logged on from without a password.
-[[user:Aidan Elliott-McCrea|Aidan Elliott-McCrea]]



I created a new user with username novalis.  I can log in, but whenever I follow any link from the login page, I am not logged in.  I get the following cookies when I log on:

WikiUserID=939

WikiLoggedIn=yes

Neither seem to have domain or path information (So, I'm using konqeror to test this, and I don't trust its reporting).  They appear to expire in about ten minutes, but that's not what's causing the bug.  I get the same bug in Galeon and Konqueror and Lynx and Links, so it's probably not client-side.

3/14/2002


:I've seen the same thing; for me it went away when I checked &quot;Save password in a cookie&quot; at login time (which of course I don't want to do on a public PC). [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]

Also tried logging out, but the system won't log me out because of the cookie thing.  Advice would be nice!  [[User:JHK|JHK]]
:We're working on it. :(

----
'''Log in doesn't set cookie path'''

(2002/1/25) The Set-Cookie header returned from the log in page doesn't include a path= variable.
Most browsers default to &quot;/&quot;; Lynx, at least, defaults to the path of the page, so login doesn't work. [[user:Carey Evans|Carey Evans]]

(2002/02/20) Actually, it looks like Mozilla defaults to the path ''to'' the page. When I wrote the report above, this was &quot;&quot; (for /wiki.phtml); now it's &quot;/wiki&quot;.
This means that [[special:userLogout]] doesn't work for anyone who logged in before the path was changed, because it doesn't touch the cookie with path &quot;&quot;.

The '''Battle of Wakefield''' took place in [[Sandal Magna]] near [[Wakefield]] in [[northern England]], on 30 December 1460. It was a major battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The opposing forces were an army led by nobles loyal to the captive King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] of the [[House of Lancaster]] and his Queen [[Margaret of Anjou]] on one side, and the army of [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], the rival claimant to the throne, on the other.

For several years before the battle, the Duke of York had become increasingly opposed to the weak King Henry's court. After open warfare broke out between the factions and Henry became his prisoner, he laid claim to the throne, but lacked sufficient support. Instead, in an agreement known as the [[Act of Accord]], he was made Henry's heir to the throne, displacing from the succession Henry's and Margaret's 7-year-old son [[Edward of Westminster|Edward, Prince of Wales]]. Margaret of Anjou and several prominent nobles were irreconcilably opposed to this accord, and massed their armies in the north. Richard of York marched north to deal with them, but found he was outnumbered.

Although he occupied [[Sandal Castle]], York sortied from the castle on 30 December. His reasons for doing so have been variously ascribed to deception by the Lancastrian armies, or treachery by some nobles and Lancastrian officers who York thought were his allies, or simple rashness or miscalculation by York. The Duke of York was killed and his army was destroyed. Many of the prominent Yorkist leaders and their family members died in the battle or were captured and executed.

==Background==
King Henry VI ascended the throne in 1422, when he was only nine months old. He grew up to be an ineffective king, and prone to spells of mental illness. There were increasingly bitter divisions among the officials and councillors who governed in Henry's name, mainly over the conduct of the [[Hundred Years' War]] with France. By the early 1450s, the most important rivalry was that between [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]]. York argued for a more vigorous prosecution of the war, to recover territories recently lost to the French,&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2016), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; while Somerset belonged to the party which tried to secure peace by making concessions.&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, pp. 111, 112&lt;/ref&gt; York had been Lieutenant in France for several years and resented being supplanted in that office by Somerset, who had then failed to defend [[Normandy]] against French armies.&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, pp. 112, 119&lt;/ref&gt;

York was not only the wealthiest magnate in the land,&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; but was also descended through both his parents from [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], leading to calls that he be recognised as successor to the childless King Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Seward, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; His rival, Somerset, belonged to the [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort family]], who were distant cousins of King Henry. Originally illegitimate, the Beauforts had been made legitimate by an Act of Parliament but were supposedly barred from the line of succession to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (2012), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was always the possibility that this could be circumvented and the Beaufort line eventually produced King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and the [[Tudor dynasty]].

York was appointed [[Chief governor of Ireland|Lieutenant of Ireland]], effectively exiling him from court, while Somerset increased his influence over the King. In 1452, York marched on London in an attempt to force Henry to dismiss Somerset from the government, but at this stage he lacked support and was forced to swear not to take arms against the King at [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Seward, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1453, Henry VI suffered a complete mental breakdown. The [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] of peers appointed York [[Lord Protector]] and he governed the country responsibly, but Henry recovered his sanity after eighteen months and restored Somerset to favour. During Henry's madness his Queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], had given birth to a son, which dashed York's hopes of becoming king if Henry died.&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2015), p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing arrest for treason, York and his most prominent allies, the Nevilles (York's brother in law, the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]] and his son, the [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], later known as the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;), finally resorted to armed force in 1455. At the [[First Battle of St Albans]], many of York's and Salisbury's rivals and enemies were killed, including Somerset, the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] (whose family, the Percys, had been involved in a [[Percy-Neville feud|long-running feud]] with the Nevilles) and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford|Lord Clifford]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

After the battle, York reaffirmed his loyalty to King Henry, who had been found abandoned in a shop in the town. He was reappointed Lord Protector and Lieutenant of Ireland. Margaret of Anjou nevertheless suspected York of wishing to supplant her infant son, Edward, as Henry's successor, and the heirs of the Lancastrian nobles who were killed at St Albans remained at deadly [[feud]] with York.&lt;ref name=Rose143&gt;Rowse, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of the year preceding Wakefield==
After an uneasy peace during which attempts at reconciliation failed, hostilities broke out again in 1459. Richard of York once again feared indictment for rebellion by a Great Council dominated by his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (2012), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; He and the Nevilles concentrated their forces near York's stronghold at [[Ludlow Castle]] in the [[Welsh Marches]] but at the confrontation with the royal army which became known as the [[Battle of Ludford]], some of Warwick's contingent from the garrison of [[Calais]], led by experienced captain [[Andrew Trollope]], defected overnight. York and the Nevilles promptly abandoned their troops and fled. The next day, the outnumbered and leaderless Yorkist army surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2015), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

York went to Ireland, where he had unchallenged support, while Salisbury, Warwick and York's eldest son [[Edward IV of England|Edward, Earl of March]] made their way to Calais, where Warwick was [[Constable of Calais|Constable]]. They narrowly forestalled the new [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] who, with Trollope, had been sent to regain it.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt; Lancastrian attempts to reassert their authority over Ireland and Calais failed, but York and his supporters were declared traitors and [[attainder|attainted]]. The victorious Lancastrians became reviled for the manner in which their army had looted the town of Ludlow after the Yorkist surrender at Ludford Bridge, and the repressive acts of a compliant [[Parliament of Devils]] which caused many uncommitted peers to fear for their own property and titles.&lt;ref&gt;Seward, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; The country remained in disorder.

In 1460, the Nevilles invaded England through a foothold they had already established at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]] and rapidly secured London and the South of England where Warwick had popular support. They then advanced north to engage Henry's army in the Midlands. At the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]], part of the Lancastrian army defected and the rest were decisively defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Michael. ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale University Press, 2010), 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was captured on the battlefield for the second time. He was taken to London, and confined in the [[Bishop of London]]'s palace.&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Neville (bishop)|George Neville]], Bishop of Exeter, was appointed Chancellor of England and [[Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex|Viscount Bourchier]] (York's brother in law) was appointed Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Charles. ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke of York landed in [[Chester]] some weeks later and made his way to London with much pomp. Entering [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], he attempted to claim the throne, but was met with stunned silence. Even his close allies were not prepared to support such a drastic step.&lt;ref&gt;Seward, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, after the [[House of Lords]] had considered his claim, they passed the [[Act of Accord]], by which Henry would remain king, but York would govern the country as Lord Protector. Henry's son was disinherited, and York or his heirs would become king on Henry's death.&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; The powerless and frightened Henry was forced to assent.

When the Battle of Northampton was fought, Queen Margaret and her seven-year-old son Edward had been at [[Eccleshall Castle]] near [[Coventry]]. After many adventures with brigands and outlaws&lt;ref name=Rowse143&gt;Rowse, p.143&lt;/ref&gt; they fled via [[Cheshire]] to [[Harlech Castle]] in North Wales, where they joined Lancastrian nobles (including Henry's half-brother [[Jasper Tudor]] and the [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter|Duke of Exeter]]) who were recruiting armies in Wales and the [[West Country]]. They later proceeded by ship to [[Scotland]], where Margaret gained troops and other aid for the Lancastrian cause from the Queen and Regent, [[Mary of Guelders]], in return for the surrender of the town and castle of [[Berwick upon Tweed]].&lt;ref name=Rowse144&gt;Rowse, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, other Lancastrians were rallying in [[Northern England]]. Many of them, including the [[Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] and Lords [[John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford|Clifford]] and [[Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros|Ros]], had estates and influence in the north. They were later joined by the [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]]{{#tag:ref|Somerset had been besieging Calais, but was outwardly reconciled to Warwick on 8 August 1460 and allowed to return to England&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2016), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} and the [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], who brought their forces from the West Country.&lt;ref name=Rowse143/&gt; Northumberland, Clifford and Somerset were the sons of York's and Salisbury's rivals who had been killed at St. Albans. The Lancastrian forces mustered near [[Kingston upon Hull]], and were said (in ''Gregory's Chronicle'', a near-contemporary account) to number 15,000. A substantial part of these forces encamped at [[Pontefract]] began pillaging York's and Salisbury's estates nearby.&lt;ref name=Rowse143/&gt;

===York's response===
Faced with these challenges to his authority as Protector, York despatched his eldest son Edward to the Welsh Marches to contain the Lancastrians in Wales and left the Earl of Warwick in charge in London. He himself marched to the north of England on 9 December, accompanied by his second son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], and the Earl of Salisbury. He tried to bring a train of artillery under &quot;one called Lovelace, a gentleman of Kent&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2016), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; but bad weather forced the artillery to return to London.

York's and Salisbury's army was said by some to number 8,000 to 9,000 men, but by others to be only a few hundred strong, as York intended to recruit local forces with a [[Commission of Array]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009|author=Dockray, Keith| page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had probably underestimated both the numbers of the Lancastrian army in the north and the degree of opposition he had provoked by his attempt to seize the throne. On an earlier expedition to the north during his first protectorship in 1454, he and the Nevilles had easily subdued a rebellion by the Percys and the Duke of Exeter.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2016), pp.120–125&lt;/ref&gt; In 1460, not only had almost every other northern peer joined the Lancastrian army, but York's nominal supporters were also divided. The Nevilles were one of the wealthiest and most influential families in the North and in addition to controlling large estates, the Earl of Salisbury had held the office of [[Lord Warden of the Marches#Warden of the Eastern March|Warden of the Eastern March]] for several years. However, in the [[Neville-Neville feud]], the cadet branch of the family headed by Salisbury had largely disinherited and eclipsed the senior branch (sometimes referred to as the &quot;northern Nevilles&quot;)&lt;ref name=Rowse143/&gt; under his great nephew, the [[Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland|Earl of Westmoreland]]. Westmoreland had spent several years trying to recover his lands.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2016), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; He had since become too ill, perhaps with some mental disorder, to play any active part. His younger brother, [[John Neville, Baron Neville|John Neville of Raby]], had much to gain by York's and Salisbury's destruction.&lt;ref name=Goodwin145&gt;Goodwin (2012), pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lancastrians were still being reinforced. On 16 December, at the [[Battle of Worksop]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], York's vanguard clashed with Somerset's contingent from the West Country moving north to join the Lancastrian army, and was defeated.&lt;ref name=Warner49&gt;Warner, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
[[File:SandalCastleMotte.jpg|right|thumb|The remains of the [[motte-and-bailey|motte]] of Sandal Castle]]
On 21 December, York reached his own fortress of [[Sandal Castle]] near Wakefield. He sent probes towards the Lancastrian camp at Pontefract {{convert|9|mi|km}} to the east, but these were repulsed. York sent for help to his son Edward, but before any reinforcements could arrive, he sortied from the castle on 30 December.&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2015), p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known for certain why York did so. One theory was later recounted in ''[[Edward Hall]]'s chronicle'', written a few decades after the event, but partly from first-hand sources, and the contemporary [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] ''[[Jean de Waurin]]'s'' chronicle. In a stratagem possibly devised by the veteran Andrew Trollope (who by Waurin's account had also sent messages to York via feigned deserters that he was prepared to change sides once again)&lt;ref name=Seward83&gt;Seward (2007), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; half the Lancastrian army under Somerset and Clifford advanced openly towards Sandal Castle, over the open space known as &quot;Wakefield Green&quot; between the castle and the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|River Calder]], while the remainder under Ros and the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]] were concealed in the woods surrounding the area.&lt;ref name=Dockray10&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|However, Wiltshire was almost certainly not present. He had fled to the continent shortly before the Nevilles landed at Sandwich&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2016), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; and landed in South Wales with a force of Breton, French and Irish mercenaries in the early weeks of 1461.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2016), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} York was probably short of provisions in the castle and, seeing that the enemy were apparently no stronger than his own army, seized the opportunity to engage them in the open rather than withstand a siege while waiting for reinforcements.&lt;ref name=Warner50&gt;Warner, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

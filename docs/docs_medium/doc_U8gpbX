Although [[optical fiber]] had been invented in 1970, this cable was still using [[coaxial cable]] technology.

[[AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories]] developed the technologies used in the cable.&lt;ref name=HAC/&gt; The system was made possible by optical amplifiers acting as repeaters with advantages over the electrical repeaters of former cables.

The cable lands in [[Tuckerton, New Jersey]], USA, [[Widemouth Bay]], England, UK, and [[Penmarch]], France.

The system was built at an initial cost of US$335 million&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b6iq3eIXCGgC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=TAT-8+cost+million&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MgUmfmhNrg&amp;sig=ACfU3U1IdBeGgNTeiCSPFF5-Hrkb_2OUqA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLnciygtThAhWR0KYKHT15CocQ6AEwAHoECF0QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=TAT-8%20cost%20million&amp;f=false Fiber Optics Weekly Update, IGI Consalting Inc, 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988 and was retired from service in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2009/04/17/gallery-an-illustrat.html | title=Gallery: An illustrated history of the transoceanic cable - Boing Boing Gadgets}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capacity was reached in eighteen months despite optimistic predictions that the capacity would not be filled for a decade and some that it would never be filled and no other cables would be needed.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

==History==

This was the first transatlantic cable to use [[optical fiber]]s, a revolution in telecommunications. The system contained two working pairs of optical fibers; a third was reserved as a spare. The signal on each optical fiber was modulated at 295.6 Mbit/s (carrying 20 Mbit/s of traffic) and fully regenerated in equipment placed in pressure housings separated by about 40&amp;nbsp;km of cable.

There were several problems with the early reliability of this cable during its first two years of operation. The cable was buried on the continental shelf on the European and the American side of the ocean. The burial was largely effective, and the cable issues were primarily related to manufacturing defects. AT&amp;T laid a trial optical cable in the [[Canary Islands]] in 1985. This cable did not have an electrical screen and was attacked by sharks. It was never proved whether these attacks were due to the sharks sensing the electrical radiation from the cable or the vibration of the cable moving on the sea floor where it might have been suspended, or a combination of both. TAT-8 did not have the screen conductor over the vast majority of its length, as the threat of shark attack was deemed to be small over the majority of the route. Because the Canary Island cable was the first fiber-optic cable and not a [[coaxial cable]], the electrical interference shielding for the high voltage supply lines was removed. This removal did not affect the fiber, but it did cause [[feeding frenzy|feeding frenzies]] in sharks that swam nearby. The sharks would then attack the cable until the voltage lines killed them. This caused numerous, prolonged outages. Eventually, a shark shielding was developed for the cable and was available for TAT-8. [[PTAT-1]], the next cable to go in the Atlantic was put in with the shark shielding across its entire length; the added reliability provided by this shield has not been fully evaluated.

The system was manufactured by a consortium of three established submarine system suppliers: AT&amp;T, [[Standard Telephones and Cables]] and Alcatel. The idea was that each manufacturer would manufacture part of the system, so French technology procured by France Télécom would land in France, US technology in America procured by AT&amp;T and British technology procured by BT in the UK. The systems were designed to interoperate although the regenerator supervisory systems were all proprietary. The transition between one supplier to another supplier's regenerators was achieved using a &quot;mid-span meet&quot;. AT&amp;T was appointed the integration coordinator and integration trials were held in [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold, New Jersey]].

==Impact==

In 1989, with the new available capacity due to the TAT-8 cable, [[IBM]] agreed to fund a dedicated [[T-carrier|T1]] link between [[Cornell University]] and [[CERN]], which was completed in February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZdGAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=1989+cornell+ibm+transatlantic&amp;pg=PA90 |title=Network Geeks: How They Built the Internet| author= Carpenter, Brian |date=10 April 2013|isbn=9781447150251|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It greatly increased the connectivity between the American and European portions of the early [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fluckiger |first=Francois |date=February 2000 |title=The European Researchers' Network |journal=La Recherche |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url=https://fluckiger.web.cern.ch/Fluckiger/Articles/F.Fluckiger-The_European_Researchers_Network.pdf |accessdate=14 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed [[Tim Berners-Lee]] a high-speed, direct and open connection to the [[NSFnet]], which greatly aided the first demonstrations of the [[World Wide Web]] 10 months later. It was also crucial, along with the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]] at the same time to the acceptance of [[TCP/IP]] protocols in Europe.

Co-owners included [[AT&amp;T Corporation]], British Telecom and France Telecom.

TAT-9 was the first [[fiber optic]] system to operate at 565 Mbit/s, twice the speed of the first transatlantic fiber optic system, TAT-8. It was also the first system to have the ability to switch traffic on demand between the five landing points: Canada, the United States, France, Spain and the United Kingdom. This enabled the smaller countries in the network to afford their own landing points, and also allowed the network to accommodate for large changes in traffic demands at any individual station, such as the dramatic increase during the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]] in [[Barcelona]].

The first-ever fiber optic switching devices that allowed for switching were called Undersea Branching Multiplexers (UBMs).

The cable ran between [[Manahawkin, New Jersey]], United States to [[Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez]] in France and [[Oxwich Bay]] in [[Wales]].

Its capacity was 3x565 between the US and the UK or between France and the US or between the UK and France. Its usual working configuration was 2x565 between UK - US, 1x565 between UK - France and 1x565 between US and France. The system was retired in 2004.

      <text bytes="1949" xml:space="preserve">'''TAT-12/13''' is a ring cable system consisting of the 12th and 13th consortia [[transatlantic telephone cable]]s, in operation from 1996, initially carrying 2 × 5 Gbit/s.

This was the first TAT cable to use a ring structure, involving two stretches of cable across the ocean floor, which explains why two numbers (12 and 13) were used. All later cables also use a ring structure, but only use one number ([[TAT-14]] etc.). The cable connected between [[Long Island]] (at [[Shirley, New York]]), USA; [[Green Hill, Rhode Island]], USA; [[Porthcurno]], UK; [[Bude]], UK; and [[Penmarch]], France.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The TAT-12/13 Cable Network&quot;, IEEE Communications Magazine, February 1996, Volume 34, Number 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The cable was constructed for US$740 million and was supplied jointly by AT&amp;T Submarine Systems, Inc (now TE Subcom owned by [[TE Connectivity]]), STC Submarine Systems (acquired by [[Alcatel-Lucent]]) and Alcatel Submarcom. Ring switching equipment was provided by the Toshiba Corporation in each of the four cable stations.

The cables in this system were the first on the trans-Atlantic route to make use of [[erbium-doped fiber amplifier]]s.

The TAT-12/13 consortia removed the cable from normal commercial service on 31 December 2008.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

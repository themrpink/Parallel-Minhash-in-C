==Frequency modulation==
[[Frequency modulation]] also generates sidebands, the bandwidth consumed depending on the modulation index - often requiring significantly more bandwidth than DSB. [[frequency modulation#Bessel functions|Bessel functions]] can be used to calculate the bandwidth requirements of FM transmissions.

==Effects==

Sidebands can [[interference (communication)|interfere]] with [[adjacent channel]]s. The part of the sideband that would overlap the neighboring channel must be suppressed by [[filter (signal processing)|filter]]s, before or after modulation (often both).  In [[broadcast band]] [[frequency modulation]] (FM), [[subcarrier]]s above 75{{nbsp}}[[kHz]] are limited to a small [[percent]]age of modulation and are prohibited above 99&amp;nbsp;kHz altogether to protect the ±75&amp;nbsp;kHz normal [[Frequency deviation|deviation]] and ±100&amp;nbsp;kHz [[Frequency channel|channel]] boundaries. [[Amateur radio]] and public service FM transmitters generally utilize ±5&amp;nbsp;kHz deviation.

To accurately reproduce the modulating waveform, the entire signal processing path of the system of transmitter, propagation path, and receiver must have enough bandwidth so that enough of the sidebands can be used to recreate the modulated signal to the desired degree of accuracy. 

In a non-linear system such as an amplifier, sidebands of the original signal frequency components  may be generated due to distortion. This is generally minimized but may be intentionally done for the [[fuzzbox]] musical effect.

In [[telecommunication]], '''signaling''' is the use of [[signal]]s for controlling [[communication]]s. This may constitute an information exchange concerning the establishment and control of a [[telecommunication circuit]] and the management of the network—in contrast to manual setup of circuits by users or administrators, for example, the sending of a signal from the transmitting end of a telecommunication circuit to inform a user at the receiving end that a message is to be sent.

==Classification==
Signaling systems may be classified based on several principal characteristics.

===In-band and out-of-band signaling===
In the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN), [[in-band signaling]] is the exchange of call control information within the same physical channel, or within the same frequency band, that the telephone call itself is using. An example is [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling]] (DTMF), which is used on most [[telephone line]]s to customer premises.

Out-of-band signaling is telecommunication signaling on a dedicated [[Communication channel|channel]] separate from that used for the telephone call. Out-of-band signaling has been used since [[Signaling System No. 6]] (SS6) was introduced in the 1970s, and also in [[Signalling System No. 7]] (SS7) in 1980 which became the standard for signaling among exchanges ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=signaling+inout-of-band&amp;i=51333,00.asp|title=Signaling in/out-of-band Definition|publisher=PC Magazine Encyclopedia|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Annabel Z. Dodd|title=The Essential Guide to Telecommunications|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4POZ66FaS0C&amp;q=SS6+SS7&amp;pg=PA219|publisher=[[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hall PTR]]|isbn=0-13-064907-4|year=2002|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Line versus register signaling===
[[Line signaling]] is concerned with conveying information on the state of the line or channel, such as on-hook, off-hook (answer supervision and disconnect supervision, together referred to as ''[[Supervision (telephony)|supervision]]''), [[Ringing (telephony)|ringing]], and [[hook flash]].  In the middle 20th century, supervision signals on [[Long-distance calling|long-distance]] trunks in North America were primarily inband, for example at [[2600 Hz]], necessitating a [[notch filter]] to prevent interference.  Late in the century, all supervisory signals had been moved out of band. With the advent of [[E-carrier|digital trunks]], supervision signals are carried by [[Robbed-bit signaling|robbed bit]]s or other bits in the [[E1-carrier]] dedicated to signaling.

[[Register signaling]] is concerned with conveying addressing information, such as the calling and/or called [[telephone number]]. In the early days of [[Telephone|telephony]], with [[Switchboard operator|operator]] handling calls, the addressing formation is by voice as &quot;Operator, connect me to Mr. Smith please&quot;. In the first half of the 20th century, addressing formation is done by using a [[rotary dial]], which rapidly breaks the line current into [[Pulse dialing|pulses]], with the number of pulses conveying the address. Finally, starting in the second half of the century, address signaling is by [[DTMF]].

===Channel-associated versus common-channel signaling===
[[Channel-associated signaling]] (CAS) employs a signaling channel that is dedicated to a specific [[B channel|bearer channel]].

[[Common-channel signaling]] (CCS) employs a signaling channel which conveys signaling information relating to multiple bearer channels. These bearer channels, therefore, have their signaling channel in common.

===Compelled signaling===
[[Compelled signaling]] refers to signaling where the receipt of each signal from an originating register needs to be explicitly acknowledged before the next signal is able to be sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-008/_1159.htm|title=compelled signaling|publisher=National Telecommunications and Information Administration|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most forms of R2 register signaling are compelled (see [[R2 signaling]]), while R1 [[multi-frequency signaling]] is not.

The term is only relevant in the case of signaling systems that use discrete signals (e.g. a combination of tones to denote one digit), as opposed to signaling systems which are message-oriented (such as SS7 and ISDN Q.931) where each message is able to convey multiple items of formation (e.g. multiple digits of the called telephone number).

===Subscriber versus trunk signaling===
Subscriber signaling refers to the signaling between the telephone and the [[telephone exchange]]. Trunk signaling is the signaling between exchanges.

==Examples==
Every signaling system can be characterized along each of the above axes of classification. A few examples:
*[[DTMF]] is an in-band, channel-associated register signaling system. It is not compelled.
*[[Signalling System No. 7|SS7]] (e.g., TUP or ISUP) is an out-of-band, common-channel signaling system that incorporates both line and register signaling.
*[[Metering pulse]]s (depending on the country, these are 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, 12&amp;nbsp;kHz or 16&amp;nbsp;kHz pulses sent by the exchange to [[payphones]] or metering boxes) are out-of-band (because they do not fall within the frequency range used by the telephony signal, which is 300 through 3400&amp;nbsp;Hz) and channel-associated. They are generally regarded as line signaling, although this is open to debate.
*[[E and M signaling]] (E&amp;M) is an out-of-band channel-associated signaling system. The base system is intended for line signaling, but if decadic pulses are used it can also convey register information. E&amp;M line signaling is however usually paired with DTMF register signaling.
*By contrast, the L1 signaling system (which typically employs a 2280&amp;nbsp;Hz tone of various durations) is an in-band channel-associated signaling system as was the SF [[2600 hertz]] system formerly used in the [[Bell System]].
*[[Loop start]], [[ground start]], reverse battery and revertive pulse systems are all DC, thus out of band, and all are channel-associated since the DC currents are on the talking wires.

Whereas common-channel signaling systems are out-of-band by definition, and in-band signaling systems are also necessarily channel-associated, the above metering pulse example demonstrates that there exist channel-associated signaling systems which are out-of-band.

{{redirect|Signal-to-noise|statistics|Effect size|other uses|}}
'''Signal-to-noise ratio''' ('''SNR''' or '''S/N''') is a measure used in [[science and engineering]] that compares the level of a desired [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] to the level of background [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]]. SNR is defined as the ratio of signal power to the [[noise power]], often expressed in [[decibel]]s. A ratio higher than 1:1 (greater than 0&amp;nbsp;dB) indicates more signal than noise.

SNR, [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and [[channel capacity]] of a [[communication channel]] are connected by the [[Shannon–Hartley theorem]].

==Definition==
Signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the ratio of the [[power (physics)|power]] of a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] (meaningful input) to the power of background [[noise (electronic)|noise]] (meaningless or unwanted input):
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{P_\mathrm{signal}}{P_\mathrm{noise}},
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|P}} is average power. Both signal and noise power must be measured at the same or equivalent points in a system, and within the same system [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].

Depending on whether the signal is a constant ({{mvar|s}}) or a random variable ({{mvar|S}}), the signal-to-noise ratio for random noise {{mvar|N}} becomes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Charles Sherman and John Butler |title=Transducers and Arrays for Underwater Sound |date=2007 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9780387331393 |page=276 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srREi-ScbFcC&amp;q=%22signal+to+noise+ratio%22+define+mean-square&amp;pg=PA276}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{s^2}{\mathrm{E}[N^2]}
&lt;/math&gt;
where E refers to the [[expected value]], i.e. in this case the [[mean square]] of {{mvar|N}},
or
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{\mathrm{E}[S^2]}{\mathrm{E}[N^2]}
&lt;/math&gt;

If the noise has [[expected value]] of zero, as is common, the denominator is its [[variance]], the square of its [[standard deviation]] {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;}}.


The signal and the noise must be measured the same way, for example as voltages across the same [[Electrical impedance|impedance]].  The [[root mean square]]s can alternatively be used in the ratio:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{P_\mathrm{signal}}{P_\mathrm{noise}} = \left ( \frac{A_\mathrm{signal}}{A_\mathrm{noise} } \right )^2,
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|A}} is [[root mean square (RMS) amplitude]] (for example, RMS voltage).

===Decibels===
Because many signals have a very wide [[dynamic range]], signals are often expressed using the [[logarithm]]ic [[decibel]] scale. Based upon the definition of decibel, signal and noise may be expressed in decibels (dB) as

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{signal,dB} = 10 \log_{10} \left ( P_\mathrm{signal} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{noise,dB} = 10 \log_{10} \left ( P_\mathrm{noise} \right ). &lt;/math&gt;

In a similar manner, SNR may be expressed in decibels as

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = 10 \log_{10} \left ( \mathrm{SNR} \right ).
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of SNR

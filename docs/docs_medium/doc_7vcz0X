[[File:Middle C.png|thumb|Middle C {{audio|Middle C.mid|Play}}]]

'''C''' or '''Do''' is the first [[note (music)|note]] of the [[C major]] [[musical scale|scale]], the third note of the [[A minor]] scale (the [[Relative key|relative minor]] of C major), and the fourth note (F, A, B, C) of the [[Guidonian hand]], commonly [[Pitch (music)|pitched]] around 261.63&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]]. The actual [[frequency]] has depended on historical [[concert pitch#History of pitch standards in Western music|pitch standard]]s, and for [[transposing instrument]]s a distinction is made between written and sounding or [[concert pitch]].

In English the term ''Do'' is used interchangeably with C only by adherents of [[Solfège#Fixed do solfège|fixed-Do solfège]]; in the [[Solfège#Movable do solfège|movable Do]] system Do refers to the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] of the prevailing [[key (music)|key]].

==Frequency==
Historically, [[concert pitch]] has varied. For an instrument in [[equal temperament]] tuned to the [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440 pitch standard]] widely adopted in 1939, middle C has a frequency around 261.63&amp;nbsp;Hz (for other notes see [[piano key frequencies]]). [[Scientific pitch]] was originally proposed in 1713 by French physicist [[Joseph Sauveur]] and based on the numerically convenient frequency of 256&amp;nbsp;Hz for middle C, all C's being [[power of two|powers of two]]. After the A440 pitch standard was adopted by musicians, the [[Acoustical Society of America]] published new frequency tables for scientific use. A movement to restore the older A435 standard has used the banners &quot;Verdi tuning&quot;, &quot;philosophical pitch&quot; or the easily confused [[scientific pitch]].

==Octave nomenclature==
===Middle C===
{{redirect|Middle C|the novel|Middle C (novel){{!}}''Middle C'' (novel)}}
Middle C (the fourth C key from left on a standard 88-key [[piano]] keyboard) is designated C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in [[scientific pitch notation]], and c′ in [[Helmholtz pitch notation]]; it is note number 60 in [[MIDI]] notation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://computermusicresource.com/midikeys.html &quot;MIDI Note/Key Number Chart&quot;], computermusicresource.com&lt;/ref&gt;

While the expression ''Middle&amp;nbsp;C'' is generally clear across instruments and clefs, some musicians naturally use the term to refer to the C note in the middle of their specific instrument's range. C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; may be called ''Low&amp;nbsp;C'' by someone playing a [[Western concert flute]], which has a higher and narrower [[playing range]] than the piano, while C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (523.251&amp;nbsp;Hz) would be Middle&amp;nbsp;C. This technically inaccurate practice has led some pedagogues to encourage standardizing on C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as the definitive Middle&amp;nbsp;C in instructional materials across all instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Large
|first= John
|date=February 1981
|title= Theory in Practice: Building a Firm Foundation
|journal= [[Music Educators Journal]]
|volume= 32
|pages= 30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Staff (music)#Great Staff / Grand Staff|Grand Staff]], middle-C is notated with a [[ledger line]] above the top line of the [[bass clef|bass staff]] or below the bottom line of the [[treble clef|treble staff]]. Alternatively, it is written on the centre line of a staff using the [[alto clef]], or on the fourth line from the bottom, or the second line from the top, of staves using the [[tenor clef]].

===Other octaves===
In vocal music, the term ''High C''  (sometimes less ambiguously called ''Top C''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/04/archives/music-view-birgit-nilsson-the-return-of-a-supersoprano-music-view.html|title=Birgit Nilsson – The Return of a Super-Soprano|author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 4, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can refer to either the soprano's  [[scientific pitch notation|''C''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]  (1046.502&amp;nbsp;Hz;  ''c''′′′ in Helmholtz notation) or the tenor's ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;; both are written as the C two ledger lines above the treble clef but the tenor voice sings an octave lower. The term ''Low C'' is sometimes used in vocal music to refer to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; because this is considered the divide between true basses and bass-baritones: a ''basso'' can sing this note easily, whereas other male voices, including bass-baritones, typically cannot.

''Tenor C'' is an [[organ builder]]'s term for ''small C'' or ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (130.813&amp;nbsp;Hz), the note one [[octave]] below Middle C. In stoplists it usually means that a [[Organ stop|rank]] is not full compass, omitting the bottom octave.

20,000 hertz is the start of the [[ultrasound]] in healthy young adults. Note that for a classical piano and musical theory, the middle C is usually labelled as C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; However, in the [[MIDI]] standard definition (like the one used in [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[GarageBand]]), this middle C (261.626&amp;nbsp;Hz) is labelled C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In practice, a MIDI software can label middle C (261.626&amp;nbsp;Hz) as C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which can cause confusions, especially for beginners.

==B sharp==
[[File:Comparison of twelve fifths.png|275px|thumb|Comparison of notes derived from, or near, twelve perfect fifths (B{{music|#}})]]

Traversing the [[circle of fifths]] can result in a B{{music|sharp}} that is higher than C by 23.46 [[Cent (music)|cents]], the ratio of twelve just [[perfect fifth]]s (B{{music|sharp}}) to seven octaves being 531,441 / 524,288, the [[Pythagorean comma]]. A B{{music|sharp}} that is three just [[major third]]s above C is lower than the octave by an interval called a [[diesis]], 125:128 or 41.06 cents.

In [[Western culture|Western]] [[musical notation]], the '''staff''' (US) or '''stave''' (UK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stave|title=stave Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Usage and etymology|(plural for either]]: '''staves''') is a set of five horizontal lines and four spaces that each represent a different musical pitch or in the case of a [[percussion staff]], different percussion instruments. Appropriate music symbols, depending on the intended effect, are placed on the staff according to their corresponding pitch or function. Musical notes are placed by pitch, percussion notes are placed by instrument, and rests and other symbols are placed by convention.

The absolute pitch of each line of a non-percussive staff is indicated by the placement of a [[clef]] symbol at the appropriate vertical position on the left-hand side of the staff (possibly modified by [[transposing instrument|conventions for specific instruments]]). For example, the [[treble clef]], also known as the G clef, is placed on the second line (counting upward), fixing that line as the pitch first G above &quot;[[middle C]]&quot;.

The lines and spaces are numbered from bottom to top; the bottom line is the ''first line'' and the top line is the ''fifth line''.

The musical staff is analogous to a mathematical [[Graph of a function|graph]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] with respect to [[duration (music)|time]]. Pitches of notes are given by their vertical position on the staff and notes are played from left to right. Unlike a graph, however, the number of [[semitone]]s represented by a vertical step from a line to an adjacent space depends on the key, and the exact timing of the beginning of each note is not directly proportional to its horizontal position; rather, exact timing is encoded by the musical symbol chosen for each note in addition to the [[tempo]].

A [[time signature]] to the right of the [[clef]] indicates the relationship between timing counts and note symbols, while [[bar (music)|bar lines]] group notes on the staff into [[Bar (music)|measures]].

==Usage and etymology==

''Staff'' is more common in [[American English]], ''stave'' in [[British English]]. The plural is ''staves'' in either case. (''Stave'' is, in fact, a [[back-formation]] from ''staves''.) &lt;ref&gt;Pam Peters, The Cambridge Guide to English Usage, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff positions==
[[Image:Staff lines and spaces SVG.svg|400px|right|thumb|Staff, with staff positions indicated.]]
The vertical position of the notehead on the staff indicates which note to play: higher-pitched notes are marked higher on the staff. The notehead can be placed with its center intersecting a line (''on a line'') or in between the lines touching the lines above and below (''in a space''). Notes outside the range of the staff are placed on or between [[ledger line]]s—lines the width of the note they need to hold—added above or below the staff.

Which staff positions represent which [[Note (music)|notes]] is determined by a [[clef]] placed at the beginning of the staff. The clef identifies a particular line as a specific note, and all other notes are determined relative to that line. For example, the [[treble clef]] puts the G above [[middle C]] on the second line. The [[Interval (music)|interval]] between adjacent staff positions is one [[steps and skips|step]] in the [[diatonic scale]]. Once fixed by a clef, the notes represented by the positions on the staff can be modified by the [[key signature]] or [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]] on individual notes. A clefless staff may be used to represent a set of [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] sounds; each line typically represents a different instrument.

==Ensemble staves==

[[Image:Brace (music).png|right|240px|Musical brace.]]
[[Image:Bracket (music).png|right|240px|Musical bracket.]]
A '''vertical line''' drawn to the left of multiple staves creates a '''system''', indicating that the music on all the staves is to be played simultaneously. A '''bracket''' is an additional vertical line joining staves to show groupings of instruments that function as a unit, such as the string section of an orchestra. A '''brace''' is used to join multiple staves that represent an instrument, such as a piano, organ, harp, or marimba.&lt;ref name=&quot;IrvinePauly1999&quot;/&gt; Sometimes a second bracket is used to show instruments grouped in pairs, such as the first and second oboes or first and second violins in an orchestra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachmaninoff1965&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rachmaninoff|first=Sergei|title=Piano concertos nos. 1, 2, and 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIXcT_ooWpoC&amp;pg=PA261|accessdate=18 October 2011|year=1965|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-26350-2|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a brace is used for this purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;IrvinePauly1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irvine|first1=Demar|last2=Pauly|first2=Reinhard G.|last3=Radice|first3=Mark A.|title=Irvine's writing about music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RrYmediD2QC&amp;pg=PA213|accessdate=18 October 2011|year=1999|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-1-57467-049-3|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Strauss1904&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Strauss|first=Richard|title=Eine Alpensinfonie ; and, Symphonia domestica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FE08SeSZnYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA71|accessdate=18 October 2011|year=1904|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-27725-7|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When more than one system appears on a page, often two parallel diagonal strokes are placed on the left side of the score to separate them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grove System&quot;&gt;{{GroveOnline |last=Rastall |first=Richard |title=System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four-part [[SATB]] vocal settings, especially in [[hymnal]]s, use a ''divisi'' notation on a two-staff system with [[soprano]] and [[alto]] voices sharing the upper staff and [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] voices on the lower staff.

Confusingly, the German ''System'' (often in the combined forms ''Liniensystem'' or ''Notensystem'') may refer to a single staff as well as to the ''Akkolade'' (from the French) or system in the English sense; the Italian term is ''accollatura''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grove System&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wikipedia-DE&gt;[[:de:Notensystem (Musik)#Akkolade|description in the German language Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Grand staff.svg|thumb|The grand staff]]
When music on two staves is joined by a [[Bracket#Curly brackets or braces .7B .7D|brace]], or is intended to be played at once by a single performer (usually a [[keyboard instrument]] or [[harp]]), a '''grand staff''' ([[American English]]) or '''great stave''' ([[British English]]) is created. Typically, the upper staff uses a [[treble clef]] and the lower staff has a [[bass clef]]. In this instance, [[middle C]] is centered between the two staves, and it can be written on the first [[ledger line]] below the upper staff or the first ledger line above the lower staff. Very rarely, a centered line with a small alto clef is written, and usually used to indicate that B, C, or D on the line can be played with either hand (ledger lines are not used from a center alto as this creates confusion). When playing the [[piano]] or harp, the upper staff is normally played with the right hand and the lower staff with the left hand. In music intended for [[organ (music)|organ]] with [[Pedal keyboard|pedalboard]], a grand staff normally comprises three staves, one for each hand on the manuals and one for the feet on the pedalboard.

==History==
[[Image:Beneventan music manuscript example.jpg|400px|thumb|12th-century Beneventan manuscript showing diastematic neumes and a single-line staff]]

Early Western medieval notation was written with [[neume]]s, which did not specify exact pitches but only the shape of the melodies, i.e. indicating when the musical line went up or down; presumably these were intended as mnemonics for melodies which had been taught by rote.

During the 9th through 11th centuries a number of systems were developed to specify pitch more precisely, including '''diastematic neumes''' whose height on the page corresponded with their absolute pitch level (Longobardian and Beneventan manuscripts from Italy show this technique around AD 1000). '''Digraphic''' notation, using letter names similar to modern [[note (music)|note names]] in conjunction with the neumes, made a brief appearance in a few manuscripts, but a number of manuscripts used one or more horizontal lines to indicate particular pitches.

[[File:Byrd manuscript sample.jpg|thumb|right|Excerpt from a keyboard work by [[William Byrd]] written on a six-line staff, 1591]]The treatise ''[[Musica enchiriadis]]'' (AD 900) uses [[Daseian]] notation for indicating specific pitches, but the modern use of staff lines is attributed to [[Guido d'Arezzo]] (AD 990–1050), whose four-line staff is still used (though without the red and yellow coloring he recommended) in [[Liber usualis|Gregorian chant publications]] today. Five-line staves appeared in Italy in the 13th century and it was promoted by [[Ugolino da Forlì]]; staves with four, five, and six lines were used as late as 1600.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Dictionary of Music (2nd edition, 1972): Neume, Staff&lt;/ref&gt;

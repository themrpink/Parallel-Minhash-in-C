It was [[Aristotle]] who held that relativism implied we should, sticking with appearances only, end up contradicting ourselves somewhere if we could apply all attributes to all ''ousiai'' ([[being]]s). Aristotle, however, made non-contradiction dependent upon his [[essentialism]]. If his essentialism is false, then so too is his ground for disallowing relativism. (Subsequent philosophers have found other reasons for supporting the principle of non-contradiction).{{clarify|date=December 2012}}

Beginning with [[Protagoras]] and invoking [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], Margolis shows that the historic struggle to discredit relativism is an attempt to impose an unexamined belief in the world's essentially rigid rule-like nature. Plato and Aristotle merely attacked &quot;relationalism&quot;—the doctrine of true-for l or true for k, and the like, where l and k are different speakers or different worlds, or the something similar (Most philosophers would call this position &quot;relativism&quot;). For Margolis, &quot;true&quot; means true; that is, the alethic use of &quot;true&quot; remains untouched. However, in real world contexts, and context is ubiquitous in the real world, we must apply truth values. Here, in epistemic terms, we{{Who|date=July 2011}} might retire &quot;true&quot; ''tout court'' as an evaluation and keep &quot;false&quot;. The rest of our value-judgements could be graded from &quot;extremely plausible&quot; down to &quot;false&quot;. Judgements which on a bivalent logic would be incompatible or contradictory are further seen as &quot;incongruent&quot;, though one may well have more weight than the other. In short, relativistic logic is not, or need not be, the bugbear it is often presented to be. It may simply be the best type of logic to apply to certain very uncertain spheres of real experiences in the world (although some sort of logic needs to be applied to make that judgement). Those who swear by [[bivalent logic]] might simply be the ultimate keepers of the great fear of the flux.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=====Richard Rorty=====
Philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] has a somewhat [[paradox]]ical role in the debate over relativism: he is criticized for his relativistic views by many commentators, but has always denied that relativism applies to much anybody, being nothing more than a Platonic scarecrow.  Rorty claims, rather, that he is a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]], and that to construe pragmatism as relativism is to [[beg the question]].

:'&quot;Relativism&quot; is the traditional epithet applied to pragmatism by realists'&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. ''Consequences of Pragmatism''&lt;/ref&gt;

:'&quot;Relativism&quot; is the view that every belief on a certain topic, or perhaps about any topic, is as good as every other. No one holds this view. Except for the occasional cooperative freshman, one cannot find anybody who says that two incompatible opinions on an important topic are equally good. The philosophers who get called 'relativists' are those who say that the grounds for choosing between such opinions are less algorithmic than had been thought.'&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rorty, ''Pragmatism, Relativism, and Irrationalism''&lt;/ref&gt;

:'In short, my strategy for escaping the self-referential difficulties into which &quot;the Relativist&quot; keeps getting himself is to move everything over from epistemology and metaphysics into cultural politics, from claims to knowledge and appeals to self-evidence to suggestions about what we should try.'&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. ''Hilary Putnam and the Relativist Menace''&lt;/ref&gt;

Rorty takes a [[Deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]] attitude to [[truth]], believing there is nothing of interest to be said about truth in general, including the contention that it is generally subjective. He also argues that the notion of [[Theory of justification|warrant]] or justification can do most of the work traditionally assigned to the concept of truth, and that justification ''is'' relative; justification is justification to an audience, for Rorty.

In ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'' he argues that the debate between so-called relativists and so-called objectivists is beside the point because they don't have enough premises in common for either side to prove anything to the other.

===== Nalin de Silva =====
In his book ''Mage Lokaya'' (My World), 1986, [[Nalin de Silva]]  criticized the basis of the established western system of knowledge, and its propagation, which he refers as &quot;domination throughout the world&quot;.He explained in this book that mind independent reality is impossible and knowledge is not found but constructed. Further he has introduced and developed the concept of &quot;Constructive Relativism&quot; as the basis on which knowledge is constructed relative to the sense organs, culture and the mind completely based on [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|Avidya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://repository.kln.ac.lk/jspui/bitstream/123456789/5923/1/109.pdf|title=Constructive Relativism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Postmodernism&lt;!--'Postmodern relativism' redirects here--&gt;====
The term &quot;relativism&quot; often comes up in debates over [[postmodernism]], [[poststructuralism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Critics of these perspectives often identify advocates with the label &quot;relativism&quot;. For example, the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is often considered a relativist view because it posits that linguistic categories and structures shape the way people view the world. [[Stanley Fish]] has defended postmodernism and relativism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~ccps/rcq/Fish.pdf ''Don't Blame Relativism''] as &quot;serious thought&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

These perspectives do not strictly count as relativist in the philosophical sense, because they express agnosticism on the nature of reality and make [[epistemological]] rather than [[ontological]] claims. Nevertheless, the term is useful to differentiate them from [[Philosophical realism|realists]] who believe that the purpose of philosophy, science, or literary critique is to locate externally true meanings. Important philosophers and theorists such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Max Stirner]], political movements such as [[post-anarchism]] or [[post-Marxism]] can also be considered as relativist in this sense - though a better term might be [[social constructivist]].

The spread and popularity of this kind of &quot;soft&quot; relativism varies between academic disciplines. It has wide support in [[anthropology]] and has a majority following in cultural studies. It also has advocates in political theory and political science, sociology, and [[continental philosophy]] (as distinct from Anglo-American analytical philosophy). It has inspired empirical studies of the social construction of meaning such as those associated with labelling theory, which defenders can point to as evidence of the validity of their theories (albeit risking accusations of [[performative contradiction]] in the process). Advocates of this kind of relativism often also claim that recent developments in the natural sciences, such as Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[chaos theory]] and [[Complex systems|complexity theory]] show that science is now becoming relativistic. However, many scientists who use these methods continue to identify as realist or [[post-positivist]], and some sharply criticize the association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/ Sokal and the Science Wars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/quantum_quackery/ Quantum quackery]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===

====Jainism====
[[Mahavira]] (599-527 BC), the 24th [[Tirthankara]] of [[Jainism]], developed an early philosophy regarding relativism and [[subjectivism]] known as [[Anekantavada]]. 

====Hinduism====
[[Hinduism|Hindu religion]] has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. A [[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]] hymn states that &quot;Truth is One, though the sages tell it variously.&quot; (Ékam sat vipra bahudā vadanti)

====Buddhism====
[[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka Buddhism]], which forms the basis for many [[Mahayana]] Buddhist schools and which was founded by [[Nagarjuna]]. Nāgārjuna taught the idea of relativity. In the Ratnāvalī, he gives the example that shortness exists only in relation to the idea of length. The determination of a thing or object is only possible in relation to other things or objects, especially by way of contrast. He held that the relationship between the ideas of &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; is not due to intrinsic nature ([[svabhāva]]). This idea is also found in the Pali Nikāyas and Chinese Āgamas, in which the idea of relativity is expressed similarly: &quot;That which is the element of light ... is seen to exist on account of [in relation to] darkness; that which is the element of good is seen to exist on account of bad; that which is the element of space is seen to exist on account of form.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]], ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, pp. 96–97. In the Nikayas the quote is found at SN 2.150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhyamaka Buddhism discerns two levels of truth, absolute and relative. The [[two truths doctrine]] states that there is ''Relative'' or common-sense truth, which describes our daily experience of a concrete world, and ''Ultimate'' truth, which describes the ultimate reality as [[sunyata]], empty of concrete and inherent characteristics. The conventional truth may be interpreted as &quot;obscurative truth&quot; or &quot;that which obscures the true nature&quot; as a result. It is constituted by the appearances of mistaken awareness. Conventional truth would be the appearance that includes a duality of apprehender and apprehended, and objects perceived within that. Ultimate truths, are phenomena free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended.&lt;ref name=&quot;LevinsonAug06&quot;&gt;Levinson, Jules (August 2006) ''[http://www.berotsana.org/pdf/lotsawa_timesII_sc.pdf Lotsawa Times Volume II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724083326/http://www.berotsana.org/pdf/lotsawa_timesII_sc.pdf |date=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sikhism====
In [[Sikhism]] the [[Sikh Gurus|Gurus]] (spiritual teacher ) have propagated the message of &quot;many paths&quot; leading to the [[Ek Onkar|one God]] and ultimate [[salvation]] for all souls who tread on the path of [[righteousness]]. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths can, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the [[Lord]], certainly achieve salvation. The students of the Sikh faith are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. The holy book of the [[Sikh]]s called the [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] says: &quot;Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.&quot; [[Guru Granth Sahib]] page 1350;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1350&amp;english=t&amp;id=57718 Guru Granth Sahib page 1350]&lt;/ref&gt; later stating &quot;The seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months, and the various seasons originate from the one Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator.&quot; [[Guru Granth Sahib]] page 12,13.

====Catholicism====
The [[Catholic Church]], especially under [[John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI]], has identified relativism as one of the most significant problems for faith and morals today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/wyd082105.htm World Youth Day News August August 21, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Church and to some theologians, relativism, as a denial of absolute truth, leads to moral license and a denial of the possibility of [[sin]] and of [[God]]. Whether moral or epistemological, relativism constitutes a denial of the capacity of the human mind and reason to arrive at truth. Truth, according to Catholic theologians and philosophers (following Aristotle) consists of ''adequatio rei et intellectus'', the [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] of the mind and reality. Another way of putting it states that the [[mind]] has the same form as reality. This means when the form of the computer in front of someone (the type, color, shape, capacity, etc.) is also the form that is in their mind, then what they know is true because their mind corresponds to objective reality.

The denial of an absolute reference, of an ''axis mundi,'' denies God, who equates to Absolute Truth, according to these Christian theologians. They link relativism to [[secularism]], an obstruction of religion in [[human condition|human life.]]

=====Leo XIII=====
[[Pope Leo XIII]] (1810–1903) was the first known Pope to use the word relativism in the encyclical ''[[Humanum genus]]'' (1884). Leo XIII condemned [[Freemasonry]] and claimed that its philosophical and political system was largely based on relativism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_18840420_humanum-genus_it.html Humanum genus]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====John Paul II=====
[[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] in ''[[Veritatis Splendor]]''

:As is immediately evident, the crisis of truth is not unconnected with this development. Once the idea of a universal truth about the good, knowable by human reason, is lost, inevitably the notion of conscience also changes. Conscience is no longer considered in its primordial reality as an act of a person's intelligence, the function of which is to apply the universal knowledge of the good in a specific situation and thus to express a judgment about the right conduct to be chosen here and now. Instead, there is a tendency to grant to the individual conscience the prerogative of independently determining the criteria of good and evil and then acting accordingly. Such an outlook is quite congenial to an individualist ethic, wherein each individual is faced with his own truth, different from the truth of others. Taken to its extreme consequences, this individualism leads to a denial of the very idea of human nature.

In ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'' (The Gospel of Life), he says:

:Freedom negates and destroys itself, and becomes a factor leading to the destruction of others, when it no longer recognizes and respects its essential link with the truth. When freedom, out of a desire to emancipate itself from all forms of tradition and authority, shuts out even the most obvious evidence of an objective and universal truth, which is the foundation of personal and social life, then the person ends up by no longer taking as the sole and indisputable point of reference for his own choices the truth about good and evil, but only his subjective and changeable opinion or, indeed, his selfish interest and whim.

=====Benedict XVI=====
In April 2005, in his homily&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/gpII/documents/homily-pro-eligendo-pontifice_20050418_en.html Mass «Pro Eligendo Romano Pontifice»: Homily of Card. Joseph Ratzinger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; during Mass prior to the conclave which would elect him as [[Pope]], then [[Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]] talked about the world &quot;moving towards a dictatorship of relativism&quot;:

:How many winds of doctrine we have known in recent decades, how many ideological currents, how many ways of thinking. The small boat of thought of many Christians has often been tossed about by these waves – thrown from one extreme to the other: from Marxism to liberalism, even to libertinism; from collectivism to radical individualism; from atheism to a vague religious mysticism; from agnosticism to syncretism, and so forth. Every day new sects are created and what [[Saint Paul]] says about human trickery comes true, with cunning which tries to draw those into error (cf [[Ephesians]] 4, 14). Having a clear Faith, based on the Creed of the Church, is often labeled today as a fundamentalism. Whereas, relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and &quot;swept along by every wind of teaching&quot;, looks like the only attitude acceptable to today's standards. We are moving towards a dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything as certain and which has as its highest goal one's own ego and one's own desires. However, we have a different goal: the Son of God, true man. He is the measure of true humanism. Being an &quot;Adult&quot; means having a faith which does not follow the waves of today's fashions or the latest novelties. A faith which is deeply rooted in friendship with [[Christ]] is adult and mature. It is this friendship which opens us up to all that is good and gives us the knowledge to judge true from false, and deceit from truth.

On June 6, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI told educators:

:Today, a particularly insidious obstacle to the task of education is the massive presence in our society and culture of that relativism which, recognizing nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires. And under the semblance of freedom it becomes a prison for each one, for it separates people from one another, locking each person into his or her own 'ego'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/june/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050606_convegno-famiglia_en.html Inaugural Address at the Ecclesial Diocesan Convention of Rome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Then during the [[World Youth Day 2005|World Youth Day]] in August 2005, he also traced to relativism the problems produced by the communist and sexual revolutions, and provided a counter-counter argument.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/august/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050820_vigil-wyd_en.html 20th World Youth Day - Cologne - Marienfeld, Youth Vigil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

:In the last century we experienced revolutions with a common programme–expecting nothing more from God, they assumed total responsibility for the cause of the world in order to change it. And this, as we saw, meant that a human and partial point of view was always taken as an absolute guiding principle. Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called totalitarianism. It does not liberate man, but takes away his dignity and enslaves him. It is not ideologies that save the world, but only a return to the living God, our Creator, the Guarantor of our freedom, the Guarantor of what is really good and true.

      <text bytes="8047" xml:space="preserve">In [[computer networking]] a '''routing table''', or '''routing information base''' ('''RIB'''), is a [[data table]] stored in a [[Router (computing)|router]] or a [[network host]] that lists the routes to particular network destinations, and in some cases, [[Metrics (networking)|metrics]] (distances) associated with those routes. The routing table contains information about the [[Network topology|topology of the network]] immediately around it. 

The construction of routing tables is the primary goal of [[routing protocol]]s. [[Static route]]s are entries made in a routing table by non-automatic means and which are fixed rather than being the result of routing protocols and associated network topology discovery procedures.

==Overview==
A routing table is analogous to a distribution map in [[package delivery]]. Whenever a [[Node (networking)|node]] needs to send data to another node on a network, it must first know ''where'' to send it. If the node cannot directly connect to the destination node, it has to send it via other nodes along a route to the destination node. Each node needs to keep track of which way to deliver various packages of data, and for this it uses a routing table. A routing table is a database that keeps track of paths, like a map, and uses these to determine which way to forward traffic. A routing table is a data file in RAM that is used to store route information about directly connected and remote networks. Nodes can also share the contents of their routing table with other nodes.

The primary function of a router is to forward a packet toward its destination network, which is the destination IP address of the packet. To do this, a router needs to search the routing information stored in its routing table. The routing table contains network/next hop associations. These associations tell a router that a particular destination can be optimally reached by sending the packet to a specific router that represents the next hop on the way to the final destination. The next hop association can also be the outgoing or exit interface to the final destination.

With hop-by-hop routing, each routing table lists, for all reachable destinations, the address of the next device along the path to that destination: the next [[Hop (networking)|hop]].  Assuming that the routing tables are consistent, the simple algorithm of relaying [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] to their destination's next hop thus suffices to deliver data anywhere in a network.  Hop-by-hop is the fundamental characteristic of the IP [[Internet layer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Requirements for IPv4 Routers] |author=F. Baker |RFC=1812 |date=June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the OSI [[Network Layer]].

When a router interface is configured with an IP address and subnet mask, the interface becomes a host on that attached network. A directly connected network is a network that is directly attached to one of the router interfaces. The network address and subnet mask of the interface, along with the interface type and number, are entered into the routing table as a directly connected network.

A remote network is a network that can only be reached by sending the packet to another router. Routing table entries to remote networks may be either dynamic or static. Dynamic routes are routes to remote networks that were learned automatically by the router through a dynamic routing protocol. Static routes are routes that a network administrator manually configured.

Routing tables are also a key aspect of certain security operations, such as [[unicast reverse path forwarding]] (uRPF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |rfc=3704 |title=Ingress Filtering for Multihomed Networks |author=F. Baker &amp; P. Savola |date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique, which has several variants, the router also looks up, in the routing table, the ''source address'' of the packet.  If there exists no route back to the source address, the packet is assumed to be malformed or involved in a network attack and is dropped.

==Difficulties==
The need to record routes to large numbers of devices using limited storage space represents a major challenge in routing table construction. In the Internet, the currently dominant address aggregation technology is a bitwise prefix matching scheme called [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR). [[Supernetwork]]s can also be used to help control routing table size.

The routing table consists of at least three information fields:
#''network identifier'': The destination subnet and netmask
#''metric'': The [[routing metric]] of the path through which the packet is to be sent. The route will go in the direction of the gateway with the lowest metric.
#''next hop'': The next hop, or gateway, is the address of the next station to which the packet is to be sent on the way to its final destination

Depending on the application and implementation, it can also contain additional values that refine path selection: 
#''quality of service'' associated with the route. For example, the U flag indicates that an IP route is up.
#''filtering criteria'': [[Access-control list]]s lists associated with the route
#''interface'': Such as eth0 for the first Ethernet card, eth1 for the second Ethernet card, etc.

Shown below is an example of what the table above could look like on a computer connected to the internet via a [[home router]]:

== Major works ==
=== ''The Holy Family'' (1844) ===
[[File:OriginOfFamily-1884.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of Engels's ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'', first published in 1884]]
{{main article|The Holy Family (book)}}
This book was written by Marx and Engels in November 1844. It is a critique on the [[Young Hegelians]] and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time. The title was suggested by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the [[Bruno Bauer|Bauer]] Brothers and their supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;holy-family&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/index.htm |title=The Holy Family by Marx and Engels |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book created a controversy with much of the [[Print media|press]] and caused [[Bruno Bauer]] to attempt to refute the book in an article published in {{ill|Wigand's|de|Otto Wigand}} ''Vierteljahrsschrift'' in 1845. Bauer claimed that Marx and Engels misunderstood what he was trying to say. Marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal ''{{ill|Gesellschaftsspiegel|de}}'' in January 1846. Marx also discussed the argument in chapter 2 of ''[[The German Ideology]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;holy-family&quot;/&gt;

=== ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'' (1845) ===
{{main article|The Condition of the Working Class in England}}
A study of the deprived conditions of the working class in Manchester and Salford, based on Engel's personal observations. The work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development. Originally published in German and only translated into English in 1887, the work initially had little impact in England. It was however very influential with historians of British industrialisation throughout the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=The 'industrial revolution': interpretations from 1830 to the present|url=https://www.academia.edu/1843995|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== ''The Peasant War in Germany'' (1850) ===
{{main article|The Peasant War in Germany}}
An account of the early 16th-century uprising known as the [[German Peasants' War]], with a comparison with the recent revolutionary uprisings of 1848–1849 across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Peasant War in Germany,'' trans. Moissaye J. Olgin (New York: International Publishers, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science'' (1878) ===
{{main article|Anti-Dühring}}
Popularly known as ''Anti-Dühring'', this book is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of [[Eugen Dühring]], a German philosopher and critic of Marxism. In the course of replying to Dühring, Engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics seeking to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena. Many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work, ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]''. Three chapters of ''Anti-Dühring'' were later edited and published under the separate title, ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific''.

=== ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'' (1880) ===
{{main article|Socialism: Utopian and Scientific}}
One of the best selling socialist books of the era,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | quote = From this French text, a Polish and a Spanish edition were prepared. In 1883, our German friends brought out the pamphlet in the original language. Italian, Russian, Danish, Dutch, and Roumanian translations, based upon the German text, have since been published. Thus, the present English edition, this little book circulates in 10 languages. I am not aware that any other Socialist work, not even our Communist Manifesto of 1848, or Marx's Capital, has been so often translated. In Germany, it has had four editions of about 20,000 copies in all. | last = Engels | first = Friedrich | origyear = 1892 | chapter = Introduction | title = Socialism: Utopian and Scientific | chapter-url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm | publisher = Progress Publishers | year = 1970 | series = Marx/Engels Selected Works | volume = 3}}&lt;!--alternate editions at https://archive.org/search.php?query=title%3A%28Socialism%20Utopian%20and%20Scientific%29--&gt; Cited in {{cite book | last= Carver | first = Terrell | author-link= Terrell Carver | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | title = Engels: A Very Short Introduction | url= https://archive.org/details/engelsveryshorti00carv_145 | url-access= limited | page = [https://archive.org/details/engelsveryshorti00carv_145/page/n70 56]}} and {{citation | last = Thomas | first = Paul | contribution = Critical Reception: Marx then and now | title = The Cambridge Companion to Marx | editor-last = Carver | editor-first = Terrell | year = 1991 | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engels critiques the utopian socialists, such as [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]], and provides an explanation of the socialist framework for understanding capitalism, and an outline of the progression of social and economic development from the perspective of [[historical materialism]].

=== ''Dialectics of Nature'' (1883) ===
{{main article|Dialectics of Nature}}
''Dialectics of Nature'' (German: &quot;Dialektik der Natur&quot;) is an unfinished 1883 work by Engels that applies Marxist ideas, particularly those of dialectical materialism, to science. It was first published in the Soviet Union in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1883/don/|title=1883-Dialectics of Nature-Index|last=Engels|website=marxists.anu.edu.au|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State'' (1884) ===
{{main article|The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State}}
In this work, Engels argues that the family is an ever-changing institution that has been shaped by capitalism. It contains an historical view of the family in relation to issues of class, female subjugation and [[private property]].

'''Eadwig''', also spelled '''Edwy''' or '''Eadwige '''({{circa}} 940{{snd}}October 959), sometimes called '''the All-Fair''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britainexpress.com/History/monarchs.htm Britain Express – English Monarchs]&lt;/ref&gt; was [[King of the English]] from 955 until his premature death.

The elder son of [[Edmund I]] and [[Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury]], Eadwig became king in 955 aged 15 following the death of his uncle [[Eadred]]. Eadwig's short reign was tarnished by disputes with nobles and men of the church, including Archbishops [[Dunstan]] and [[Oda of Canterbury|Oda]]. He died in 959, having ruled less than four years. He was buried in the capital [[Winchester]]. His brother [[Edgar the Peaceful]] succeeded him.

==Feud with Dunstan==
[[File:William Hamilton - Edwy and Elgiva, A Scene from Saxon History - BF.1986.13 - Museum of Fine Arts.jpg|thumb|''Edwy and Elgiva: A Scene from Saxon History'', 1793 painting by [[William Hamilton (painter)|William Hamilton]]]]
According to the earliest life of St [[Dunstan]], written around the year 1000, Eadwig left the banquet which followed his coronation in [[Kingston upon Thames]], and was found cavorting with a noblewoman named Æthelgifu and her daughter. Dunstan dragged him back to the banquet, earning the enmity of Eadwig and the two women, and at Æthelgifu's instigation Dunstan was deprived of his abbacy of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]] and forced into exile.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

The contemporary record of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' reports Eadwig's accession and Dunstan fleeing England in 957, but does not explain why Dunstan fled. Thus this report of a feud between Eadwig and Dunstan could either have been based on a true incident of a political quarrel for power between a young king and powerful church officials who wished to control the king and who later spread this legend to blacken his reputation, or it could be mere [[folklore]]; the ''Chronicle'' also tells of Oda putting aside the King's marriage on the grounds Eadwig and his wife were &quot;too related&quot;.&lt;ref name=Cavendish&gt;[https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/death-king-eadwig-english Cavendish, Rishard. &quot;Death of King Eadwig of the English&quot;, ''History Today'', Vol. 59 Issue 10 October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The account of the quarrel with Dunstan and [[Kynsy|Cynesige, bishop of Lichfield]] at the coronation feast is recorded in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' and in the later chronicle of [[John of Worcester]] and was written by monks supportive of Dunstan's position. The &quot;cavorting&quot; in question consisted of Eadwig (then only 16) being away from the feast with [[Ælfgifu, wife of Eadwig|Ælfgifu]] and her mother Æthelgifu. He later married Ælfgifu, who seems to have been the sister of [[Æthelweard the Chronicler]]. Æthelweard describes himself as the &quot;grandson's grandson&quot; of King [[Æthelred of Wessex|Æthelred I]]. Eadwig was the son of King [[Edmund I of England|Edmund the Magnificent]], grandson of King [[Edward the Elder]], great-grandson of King [[Alfred the Great]], and therefore great-great-nephew of King Æthelred I. Eadwig and Ælfgifu were therefore third cousins once removed.

==Annulment of marriage==
The [[annulment]] of the marriage of Eadwig and Ælfgifu is unusual in that it was against their will, clearly politically motivated by the supporters of Dunstan. The Church at the time regarded any union within seven degrees of [[consanguinity]] as incestuous.&lt;ref&gt;Constance B. Bouchard, 'Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries', Speculum, Vol. 56, No. 2 (Apr., 1981), pp. 269–70&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, &quot;degree&quot; was reached by counting up to the common ancestor: a second cousin would have been related within the third degree.

==Division of the Kingdom==
Dunstan, whilst in exile, became influenced by the [[Benedictine]]s of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. A pro-Dunstan, pro-Benedictine party began to form around [[Athelstan Half-King]]'s domain of [[East Anglia]] and supporting Eadwig's younger brother [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]].

Frustrated by the king's impositions and supported by Archbishop [[Oda of Canterbury]], the Thanes of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]] switched their allegiance to Eadwig's brother Edgar.&lt;ref name=Cavendish/&gt; In 957, rather than see the country descend into civil war, the nobles agreed to divide the kingdom along the [[Thames]], with Eadwig keeping [[Wessex]] and [[Kent]] in the south and Edgar ruling in the north.

Eadwig died on 1 October 959 and was buried in the [[New Minster, Winchester]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He was succeeded by his brother Edgar, who reunited the kingdom.

==Charter evidence==
[[File:S 594 Diploma of King Eadwig for Ælfwine AD 956.tif|thumb|260px|A charter created during the reign of Eadwig dated 956]]
Eadwig is known for his remarkable generosity in giving away land. In 956 alone, his sixty odd gifts of land make up around 5% of all genuine Anglo-Saxon charters. No known ruler in Europe matched that yearly total before the twelfth century, and his cessions are plausibly attributed to political insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Wickham, 'Problems in Doing Comparative History', pp. 19–20, in ''Challenging the Boundaries of Medieval History: The Legacy of Timothy Reuter'', [[Patricia Skinner (historian)|Patricia Skinner]], ed, Brepols 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art and literature==
The history of Eadwig's reign caught the British imagination in the later 18th century, and was represented in paintings and drama, in particular, by numerous works to 1850. Artists who tackled the subjects it suggested included [[William Bromley (artist)|William Bromley]], [[William Hamilton (painter)|William Hamilton]], [[William Dyce]], [[Richard Dadd]], and Thomas Roods. Literary works were written by [[Thomas Sedgwick Whalley]], [[Thomas Warwick]], [[Augustine David Crake]] and [[Frances Burney]], who wrote a play entitled ''Edwy and Elgiva''.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=8572|title=Eadwig|first=Simon|last=Keynes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{tone|date=February 2020}}
In [[computer network]]ing, '''IP over Avian Carriers''' ('''IPoAC''') is a proposal to carry [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) [[Internet traffic|traffic]] by [[bird]]s such as [[homing pigeon]]s.  IP over Avian Carriers was initially described in RFC 1149, a [[Request for Comments]] (RFC) issued by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), written by D. Waitzman, and released on April 1, 1990.  It is one of several [[April Fools' Day Request for Comments]].

Waitzman described an improvement of his protocol in RFC 2549, ''IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of Service'' (1 April 1999).  Later, in RFC 6214—released on 1 April 2011, and 13 years after the introduction of [[IPv6]]—[[Brian Carpenter (Internet engineer)|Brian Carpenter]] and Robert Hinden published ''Adaptation of RFC&lt;nowiki/&gt; 1149 for IPv6''.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 6214&lt;/ref&gt;

IPoAC has been successfully implemented, but for only nine packets of data, with a [[packet loss]] ratio of 55% (due to operator error),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149/writeup/|title=The informal report from the RFC 1149 event|work=BLUG}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[response time (telecommunications)|response time]] ranging from 3,000 seconds (≈50 minutes) to over 6,000 seconds (≈1.77 hours). Thus, this technology suffers from poor [[latency (engineering)|latency]]. Nevertheless, for large transfers, avian carriers are capable of high average throughput when carrying flash memory devices, effectively implementing a [[sneakernet]]. During the last 20 years, the information density of storage media and thus the bandwidth of an avian carrier has increased 3 times as fast as the bandwidth of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/02/sneakernet-beats-internet.html &quot;Truckloads of hard disks&quot;], ''Low-tech Magazine'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; IPoAC may achieve bandwidth peaks of orders of magnitude more than the Internet when used with multiple avian carriers in rural areas. For example: If 16 homing pigeons are given eight 512&amp;nbsp;GB SD cards each, and take an hour to reach their destination, the throughput of the transfer would be 145.6 Gbit/s, excluding transfer to and from the SD cards.

== Real-life implementation ==
On 28 April 2001, IPoAC was implemented by the [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] Linux user group, under the name CPIP (for &quot;Carrier Pigeon Internet Protocol&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149|title=RFC-1149|work=BLUG}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sent nine [[Packet (information technology)|packet]]s over a distance of approximately five kilometers (three miles), each carried by an individual pigeon and containing one ping ([[ICMP Echo Request]]), and received four responses.

This real life implementation was mentioned by the French MP [[Martine Billard]] in the French [[Assemblée Nationale]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/cri/2008-2009-extra/20091030.asp|title=Assemblée nationale ~  Troisième séance du mercredi 22 juillet 2009|publisher=|quote=J’avais été choquée, monsieur le ministre, de vous entendre parler de pigeons voyageurs, mais, finalement, vous aviez peut-être raison. Il existe en effet une norme, la norme RFC 1149, qui date du 1er avril 1990 bien que ce n’est pas un poisson d’avril (Sourires), qui décrit comment on peut faire une transmission internet par pigeon voyageur. Neuf paquets de données ont été envoyés.}}&lt;/ref&gt; during debates about [[Hadopi]].
The implementation was noted in the song &quot;Paper Pings&quot; by Steve Savitzky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steve.savitzky.net/Songs/pigeon/|title=Paper Pings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks ==
In December 2005, a Gartner report on bird flu that concluded “A pandemic wouldn't affect IT systems directly” was humorously criticized for neglecting to consider RFC 1149 and RFC 2549 in its analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.yuikee.com.hk/newsletter/2005/12/g.html|title=Virus Risks of RFC1149 and RFC2549|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

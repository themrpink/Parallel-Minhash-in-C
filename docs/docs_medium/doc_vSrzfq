'''Auster Aircraft Limited''' was a British aircraft manufacturer from 1938 to 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis1&quot;&gt;Willis, issue 122, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company began in 1938 at the Britannia Works, [[Thurmaston]] near [[Leicester]], England, as '''Taylorcraft Aeroplanes (England) Limited''', making light observation aircraft designed by the [[Taylorcraft|Taylorcraft Aircraft Corporation]] of America.  1,604 high-wing [[Taylorcraft Auster]] [[monoplane]]s were built during [[World War II]] for the armed forces of the UK and [[Canada]], primarily for the role of [[Air Observation Post]] (AOP).

[[File:Auster J.1N Alpha G-AGXN RBY 26.03.66 edited-5.jpg|thumb|right|Auster Alpha parked in front of Auster's original assembly facilities at Rearsby in 1966]]

During the war the head office and drawing office were at a big old house on the outskirts of Thurmaston called &quot;The Woodlands&quot;. The fuselages and wings were manufactured at [[Syston]] under the works manager by the name of Sharp. Sheet metalwork was done at the old 'en tout cas' works at Thurmaston. Final assembly, fitting out and testing took place at [[Rearsby]] aerodrome. The name changed to Auster (after [[Anemoi#Auster|the Roman name for the south wind]]) on 7 March 1946, when production shifted to Rearsby aerodrome, all in [[Leicestershire]].  All designs were evolved from the early Taylorcraft with a sprung skid or [[Conventional landing gear|tailwheel]] beneath the fin (except for a low-wing aircraft called the &quot;[[Auster Agricola|Agricola]]&quot; designed for [[Aerial application|aerial farming work]]; only nine of these were completed).  When the company was merged into [[Beagle Aircraft]] in June, 1961,&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis1&quot; /&gt; the high-wing design was developed still further as the [[Beagle Terrier|Terrier]] and, with a [[Tricycle gear|nosewheel]], the Airedale.

The various Auster models were extensively used in the UK and British colonies after World War II for a variety of activities such as AOP, mail delivery, VIP transport, private owner flights and joy rides at seaside airports and town carnivals.

The Auster name was dropped in 1962 after [[Beagle Aircraft]] was created.

[[File:Iranian Handicraft.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A handicraft Selling-Factory shop, [[Isfahan]]-[[Iran]]]]

A handicraft, sometimes more precisely expressed as '''artisanal handicraft''' or '''handmade''', is any of a wide variety of types of work where useful and decorative objects are made completely by one’s hand (hense the term handicraft) or by using only simple, non-tech related tools like sissors. It is a traditional main sector of [[craft]] making and applies to a wide range of creative and [[design]] activities that are related to making things with one's hands and skill, including work with textiles, moldable and rigid materials, paper, plant fibers, etc. One of the world's oldest handicraft is [[Dhokra]]; this is a sort of metal casting that has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. In Iranian Baluchistan, women still make red ware hand made pottery with dotted ornaments much similar to the 5000 year old pottery tradition of  [[Kalpurgan]], an archaeological site near the village. Usually, the term is applied to traditional techniques of creating items (whether for personal use or as products) that are both practical and aesthetic. Handicraft industries are those that produce things with hands to meet the needs of the people in their locality without using machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=On State Street, &quot;Maker&quot; Movement Arrives |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/make_haven/id_46594 |date=April 30, 2012 |author=Thomas MacMillan |work=New Haven Independent |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaiacollection.com/ |title=Gaia Handicraft |accessdate=November 23, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026083037/http://www.gaiacollection.com/ |archivedate=October 26, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invent To Learn|last=Martinez|first=Sylvia|publisher=Constructing Modern Knowledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9891511-0-8|location=Torrance, CA|pages=32–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dugang |first1=Lilia |title=Handicraft |url=https://handicraftsmv.weebly.com/types-of-handicrafts.html |website=Vocabulary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collective terms for handicrafts include '''artisanry''', '''handicrafting''', '''crafting''', '''handicraftsmanship''' and '''handcrafting'''.
The term '''arts and crafts''' is also applied, especially in the United States and mostly to hobbyists' and children's output rather than items crafted for daily use, but this distinction is not formal, and the term is easily confused with the [[Arts and Crafts]] design movement, which is in fact as practical as it is aesthetic.

Handicraft has its roots in the [[rural crafts]]—the material-goods necessities—of ancient civilizations, and many specific crafts have been practiced for centuries, while others are modern inventions or popularizations of crafts which were originally practiced in a limited geographic area.

Many handcrafters use natural, even entirely indigenous, materials while others may prefer modern, non-traditional materials, and even [[Upcycling|upcycle]] industrial materials. The individual [[artisan]]ship of a handcrafted item is the paramount criterion; those made by [[mass production]] or machines are not handicraft goods.

Seen as developing the skills and creative interests of students, generally and sometimes towards a particular craft or trade, handicrafts are often integrated into educational systems, both informally and formally. Most crafts require the development of skill and the application of patience but can be learned by virtually anyone.

Like [[folk art]], handicraft output often has cultural and/or religious significance, and increasingly may have a political message as well, as in [[craftivism]]. Many crafts become very popular for brief periods of time (a few months, or a few years), spreading rapidly among the crafting population as everyone emulates the first examples, then their popularity wanes until a later resurgence.

==The Arts and Crafts movement in the West==
{{Main|Arts and Crafts}}
The [[Arts and Crafts]] movement originated as late 19th-century design reform and social movement principally in Europe, North America and Australia, and continues today. Its proponents are motivated by the ideals of movement founders such as [[William Morris]] and [[John Ruskin]], who proposed that in pre-industrial societies, such as the European [[Middle Ages]], people had achieved [[Catharsis|fulfillment]] through the creative process of handicrafts. This was held up in contrast to what was perceived to be the alienating effects of industrial labor.
[[File:WPA Crafts Class.gif|thumb|left|Works Progress Administration, Crafts Class, 1935]]
These activities were called ''[[craft]]s'' because originally many of them were professions under the [[guild]] system. Adolescents were apprenticed to a master craftsman and refined their skills over a period of years in exchange for low wages. By the time their training was complete, they were well equipped to set up in trade for themselves, earning their living with the skill that could be traded directly within the community, often for goods and services. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and the increasing mechanization of production processes gradually reduced or eliminated many of the roles professional craftspeople played, and today many handicrafts are increasingly seen, especially when no longer the mainstay of a [[Tradesman|formal vocational trade]], as a form of [[hobby]], [[folk art]] and sometimes even [[fine art]].

The term ''handicrafts'' can also refer to the products themselves of such artisanal efforts, that require specialized knowledge, maybe highly technical in their execution, require specialized equipment and/or facilities to produce, involve [[manual labor]] or a [[blue-collar]] work ethic, are accessible to the general public, and are constructed from materials with histories that exceed the boundaries of Western &quot;fine art&quot; tradition, such as [[ceramic]]s, [[glass]], [[textiles]], [[metal]] and [[wood]]. These products are produced within a specific [[community of practice]], and while they mostly differ from the products produced within the communities of art and design, the boundaries often overlap, resulting in hybrid objects. Additionally, as the interpretation and validation of art is frequently a matter of context, an audience may perceive handcrafted objects as art objects when these objects are viewed within an art context, such as in a museum or in a position of prominence in one's home.

==In modern education==
[[File: Buell Childrens Museum Art Room by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|250px|At the [[Buell Children's Museum]] in [[Pueblo, Colorado]], children and their guardians partake in &quot;arts and crafts&quot; (i.e. handicrafts)]]
[[File:Bat-Trang-Ceramic-Village6.jpg|thumb|250px|Draw and color [[Bat Trang Porcelain|Bat-Trang-Ceramic]]]]
Simple &quot;arts and crafts&quot; projects are a common elementary and middle school activity in both mainstream and alternative education systems around the world.

In some of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, more advanced handicrafts form part of the formal, compulsory school curriculum, and are collectively referred to as ''[[sloyd|slöjd]]'' in Swedish, and ''käsityö'' or ''veto'' in Finnish. Students learn how to work mainly with metal, textile and wood, not for professional training purposes as in American [[vocational education|vocational–technical schools]], but with the aim to develop children's and teens' practical skills, such as everyday problem-solving ability, tool use, and understanding of the materials that surround us for economical, cultural and environmental purposes.

Secondary schools and college and university art departments increasingly provide elective options for more handicraft-based arts, in addition to formal &quot;[[fine art]]s&quot;, a distinction that continues to fade throughout the years, especially with the rise of [[studio craft]], i.e. the use of traditional handicrafts techniques by professional fine artists.

Many [[community center]]s and schools run evening or day classes and workshops, for adults and children, offering to teach basic craft skills in a short period of time.

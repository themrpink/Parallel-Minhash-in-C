Some areas in the museum aim for younger children, including the &quot;Swiss Jollyball&quot;, the world's largest pinball machine built by a British man from Switzerland using nothing but salvaged junk; the &quot;Idea Factory&quot;, a toddler water table play area; and the &quot;Circus&quot;, featuring animated dioramas of a miniature circus as well as containing a shadow garden and several funhouse mirrors.

Silent-film star and stock-market investor [[Colleen Moore]]'s Fairy Castle &quot;dolls house&quot; is on display.

===First Level===

==== Numbers in Nature: A Mirror Maze ====
Numbers in Nature: A Mirror Maze contains an interactive theater and stations to learn about patterns in nature, including the Golden Ratio, spirals, fractal branching, and Voronoi patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msichicago.org/explore/whats-here/exhibits/numbers-in-nature/the-exhibit/explore-the-patterns/|title=Explore the Patterns|website=www.msichicago.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also contains a mirror maze to help emphasize the geometric patterns that can be utilized. 

====Transportation Gallery====
The Transportation Zone contains several permanent exhibits.

[[The Great Train Story]] is a {{convert|3500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} model railroad and recounts the story of transportation from Chicago to [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Swanson |first=Carl |title=Chicago masterpiece: Museum of Science and Industry's original layout delighted generations |url=https://mrr.trains.com/issues/2003/june-2003 |date=June 2003 |magazine=[[Model Railroader]] |url-access=subscription |access-date=22 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum includes a replica of [[Stephenson's Rocket]], which was the first steam locomotive to exceed 25 miles per hour.

The [[New York Central and Hudson River Railroad No. 999|''999 Empire State Express'']] steam locomotive was alleged to be the first vehicle to exceed {{convert|100|mph}} in 1893, although no reliable measurement ever took place (and such a speed was likely impossible).{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Another contender is ''[[GWR 3700 Class 3440 City of Truro]]''. The claim of the ''Empire State Express'' has little supporting evidence; unlike ''City of Truro'', there are no timings showing the acceleration up to 100&amp;nbsp;mph. Some contemporary American technical journals doubted that such a high speed had been attained: &quot;Many are disposed to receive with doubt the statement that on 9 May the locomotive No. 999 of the New York Central railroad ran at the speed of 100 miles an hour, or that on a subsequent date she ran a single mile in 32 seconds&quot;.&lt;ref name=Allen1893&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=Leicester |title=Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ka5MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA530 |year=1893 |page=530 |journal=[[Engineering Magazine]] |volume= 5 |access-date=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Designed to win the battle of express trains to the [[World's Columbian Exhibition]], it was donated to the museum by the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]] in 1962.  The locomotive was located outside the museum until 1993, when extensive restoration took place and it was moved indoors as an exhibit in the Transportation Zone.

A model of the [[Wright Brothers]] first airplane is on display.

Two [[World War II]] warplanes are also exhibited. Both were donated by the British government: a German Ju 87 R-2/Trop. [[Stuka]] divebomber—one of only two intact Stukas left in the world—and a British [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. Also on display is the museum's [[Travel Air Type R Mystery Ship]], nicknamed &quot;Texaco 13&quot;, which set many world records in flying.

&quot;Take Flight&quot; features the first [[Boeing 727]] jet plane in commercial service, donated by [[United Airlines]], with one wing removed and holes cut on the fuselage to facilitate visitor access.

====Science Storms====
In March 2010, the museum opened &quot;Science Storms&quot; in the [[Allstate]] Court, as a permanent exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msichicago.org/whats-here/exhibits/science-storms/|title=Science Storms|publisher=Museum of Science and Industry|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This multilevel exhibit features a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} water vapor tornado, tsunami tank, [[Tesla coil]], [[heliostat]] system, and a [[Wimshurst machine]] built by [[James Wimshurst]] in the late 19th century. Also housed are [[Newton's Cradle]], the [[color spectrum]], and [[Foucault pendulum]]. All artifacts allow guests to explore the physics and chemistry of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msichicago.org/whats-here/exhibits/science-storms/science-storms-news/ |title=Science Storms News |publisher=Museum of Science and Industry |access-date=May 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120527084352/http://www.msichicago.org/whats-here/exhibits/science-storms/science-storms-news/ |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genetics: Decoding Life====
In keeping with Rosenwald's vision, many of the exhibits are interactive. &quot;Genetics: Decoding Life&quot;, looks at how genetics affect human and animal development as well as containing a chick hatchery composed of an incubator where baby chickens hatch from their eggs and a chick pen for those that have already hatched, as well as housing [[genetically modified]] frogs, mice, and drought resistant plants.

====ToyMaker 3000====
&quot;ToyMaker 3000&quot;, is a working assembly line which lets visitors order a toy top and watch as it is made. The interactive &quot;[[Fab Lab MSI]]&quot; is intended as an interactive lab where members can &quot;build anything&quot;.

====Coal Mine====
The &quot;Coal Mine&quot; re-creates a working deep-shaft, [[bituminous coal]] mine inside the museum's Central Pavilion, using original equipment from Old Ben #17, circa 1933. It is one of the oldest exhibits at the museum. In this unique exhibit, visitors go underground and ride a mine train to different parts of the mine and learn the basics of its operation. The experience takes around 30 minutes and requires an additional fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msichicago.org/whats-here/exhibits/coal-mine/|title=Coal Mine|publisher=Museum of Science and Industry|access-date=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yesterday's Mainstreet&quot;====
&quot;Yesterday's Mainstreet&quot; is a mock-up of a Chicago street from the early 20th century, complete with a [[cobblestone]] roadway, old-fashioned light fixtures, [[fire hydrant]]s, and several shops, including the precursors to several Chicago-based businesses. Included are:
{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* [[The Berghoff (restaurant)|The Berghoff restaurant]]
* Chicago Post Office
* [[Commonwealth Edison]]
* Finnigan's Ice Cream Parlor and Photo Studio
* [[Gossard Corset Shop]]
* [[Jewel (supermarket)|Jewel Tea Company grocery]]
* Jenner and Block Law office
* Lytton's Clothing Store
* Dr. John B. Murphy's office
* [[Nickelodeon movie theater|The Nickelodeon Cinema]]
* [[Chas A. Stevens|Chas. A. Stevens &amp; Co.]]
* [[Walgreens]] Drug Company
}}

Unlike the other shops, Finnigan's Ice Cream Parlor and The Nickelodeon Cinema can be entered and are functional. Finnigan's serves an assortment of ice cream and The Cinema plays short silent films throughout the day.

====Other====
In spring 2013, the &quot;Art of the Bicycle&quot; exhibit opened, showcasing history of the bicycle, and how modern bikes are still continuing to evolve.

&quot;Reusable City&quot; focuses on recycling and other methods that could cut down harmful pollution and especially climate change and the Regenstein Hall of Science, containing a giant [[periodic table of the elements]]. Other main level exhibits include: &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, which features some aspects of how technology will change in the future; &quot;NetWorld&quot;, which focuses on the Internet and how it connects society together; &quot;Earth Revealed&quot;, featuring a &quot;Science on a Sphere&quot; holographic globe; and a &quot;Whispering Gallery&quot;.

===Second Level===
====YOU! The Experience====
The museum is also known for unique and quirky permanent exhibits, such as a walk-through model of the [[human heart]], which was removed in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Mullen |title=Museum of Science and Industry Gets a New Heart Display |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-08-26/news/0908250640_1_new-heart-science-and-industry-museum |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=August 26, 2009 |accessdate=May 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the construction of &quot;YOU! the Experience&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msichicago.org/whats-here/exhibits/you/|title=YOU! The Experience|publisher=Museum of Science and Industry|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced it with a {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, interactive, [[3D modeling|3D]] heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msichicago.org/whats-here/exhibits/you/the-exhibit/your-heart |publisher=Museum of Science and Industry |title=Your Heart |accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also well known are the &quot;Body Slices&quot; (two [[cadaver]]s exhibited in {{convert|1/2|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} slices) in the exhibit.
[[File:Mirror Maze in the Museum of Science+Industry of Chicago.jpg|thumb|Inside the Mirror Maze]]

====Other====
Several [[US Navy]] warship models are also on display in the museum, and flight simulators including of the new [[F-35 Lightning II]] are featured.

===Former Exhibits===
An [[F-104 Starfighter]] on loan to MSI from the [[US Air Force]] since 1978 was sent to the [[Mid-America Air Museum]] in [[Liberal, Kansas]] in 1993. In March 1995, Santa Fe Steam Locomotive 2903 was moved from outside the museum to the [[Illinois Railway Museum]].

===Junior Achievements US Business Hall of Fame===
The museum holds the [[Junior Achievement]]'s US Business Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Business Hall of Fame|url=http://www.jachicago.org/events/chicago-business-hall-of-fame/|publisher=Junior Achievement Chicago|access-date=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In addition to its three floors of standing exhibits, the museum hosts temporary and traveling exhibitions. Exhibitions last for five months or less and usually require a separate paid admission fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSITickets&quot; /&gt; Exhibitions at MSI have included ''Titanic: The Exhibition'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msichicago.org/scrapbook/scrapbook_exhibits/titanic1/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030203011131/http://msichicago.org/scrapbook/scrapbook_exhibits/titanic1/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 3, 2003|title=Titanic: The Exhibition|publisher=Museum of Science and Industry|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''multivariate normal distribution''', '''multivariate Gaussian distribution''', or '''joint normal distribution''' is a generalization of the one-dimensional ([[univariate]]) [[normal distribution]] to higher [[dimension]]s.  One definition is that a [[random vector]] is said to be ''k''-variate normally distributed if every [[linear combination]] of its ''k'' components has a univariate normal distribution. Its importance derives mainly from the [[Central limit theorem#Multidimensional CLT|multivariate central limit theorem]]. The multivariate normal distribution is often used to describe, at least approximately, any set of (possibly) [[Correlation (statistics)|correlated]] real-valued [[random variable]]s each of which clusters around a mean value.

== Definitions ==
=== Notation and parametrization ===
The multivariate normal distribution of a ''k''-dimensional random vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = (X_1,\ldots,X_k)^{\mathrm T}&lt;/math&gt; can be written in the following notation:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{X}\ \sim\ \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\mu,\, \boldsymbol\Sigma),
  &lt;/math&gt;
or to make it explicitly known that ''X'' is ''k''-dimensional,
: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{X}\ \sim\ \mathcal{N}_k(\boldsymbol\mu,\, \boldsymbol\Sigma),
  &lt;/math&gt;
with ''k''-dimensional [[mean vector]]
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol\mu = \operatorname{E}[\mathbf{X}] = ( \operatorname{E}[X_1], \operatorname{E}[X_2], \ldots, \operatorname{E}[X_k] ) ^ \textbf{T}, &lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;k \times k&lt;/math&gt; [[covariance matrix]]
:&lt;math&gt; \Sigma_{i,j} := \operatorname{E} [(X_i - \mu_i)( X_j - \mu_j)] = \operatorname{Cov}[X_i, X_j] &lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;1 \le i,j \le k.&lt;/math&gt; The [[Matrix inverse|inverse]] of the covariance matrix is called the [[Precision (statistics)|precision]] matrix, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Q}=\boldsymbol\Sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Standard normal random vector===
A real [[random vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = (X_1,\ldots,X_k)^{\mathrm T}&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''standard normal random vector''' if all of its components &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; are independent and each is a zero-mean unit-variance normally distributed random variable, i.e. if &lt;math&gt;X_n \sim\ \mathcal{N}(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Lapidoth&gt;{{cite book |first=Amos |last=Lapidoth |year=2009 |title=A Foundation in Digital Communication |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-19395-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 454}}

===Centered normal random vector===
A real random vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = (X_1,\ldots,X_k)^{\mathrm T}&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''centered normal random vector''' if there exists a deterministic &lt;math&gt;k \times \ell&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A} \mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt; has the same distribution as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a standard normal random vector with &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; components.&lt;ref name=Lapidoth/&gt;{{rp|p. 454}}

===Normal random vector===
A real random vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = (X_1,\ldots,X_k)^{\mathrm T}&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''normal random vector''' if there exists a random &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a standard normal random vector, a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;, and a &lt;math&gt;k \times \ell&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}=\boldsymbol{A} \mathbf{Z} + \mathbf{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Gut&gt;{{cite book |first=Allan |last=Gut |year=2009 |title=An Intermediate Course in Probability |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-441-90161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 454}}&lt;ref name=Lapidoth/&gt;{{rp|p. 455}}

Here the [[covariance matrix]] is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Sigma = \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{A}^{\mathrm T}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] case where the covariance matrix is [[singular matrix|singular]], the corresponding distribution has no density; see the [[#Degenerate_case|section below]] for details.  This case arises frequently in [[statistics]]; for example, in the distribution of the vector of [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] in the [[ordinary least squares]] regression. The &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; are in general ''not'' independent; they can be seen as the result of applying the matrix &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; to a collection of independent Gaussian variables &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Equivalent definitions ===
The following definitions are equivalent to the definition given above. A random vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = (X_1,\ldots,X_k)^T&lt;/math&gt; has a multivariate normal distribution if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions.
*Every linear combination &lt;math&gt;Y=a_1 X_1 + \cdots + a_k X_k&lt;/math&gt; of its components is [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. That is, for any constant vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt;, the random variable &lt;math&gt;Y=\mathbf{a}^{\mathrm T}\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; has a univariate normal distribution, where a univariate normal distribution with zero variance is a point mass on its mean.
*There is a ''k''-vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and a symmetric, [[Positive-definite matrix#Negative-definite.2C semidefinite and indefinite matrices|positive semidefinite]] &lt;math&gt;k \times k&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, such that the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; is
:: &lt;math&gt;
    \varphi_\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{u}) = \exp\Big( i\mathbf{u}^T\boldsymbol\mu - \tfrac{1}{2} \mathbf{u}^T\boldsymbol\Sigma \mathbf{u} \Big).
  &lt;/math&gt;

The spherical normal distribution can be characterised as the unique distribution where components are independent in any orthogonal coordinate system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kac |first1=M. |title=On a characterization of the normal distribution |journal=American Journal of Mathematics |date=1939 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=726–728 |jstor=2371328 |doi=10.2307/2371328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sinz |first1=Fabian |last2=Gerwinn |first2=Sebastian |last3=Bethge |first3=Matthias |title=Characterization of the p-generalized normal distribution |journal=Journal of Multivariate Analysis |date=2009 |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=817–820 |doi=10.1016/j.jmva.2008.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-degenerate case====
The multivariate normal distribution is said to be &quot;non-degenerate&quot; when the symmetric [[covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]. In this case the distribution has [[probability density function|density]]&lt;ref&gt;Simon J.D. Prince(June 2012).

where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf x}&lt;/math&gt; is a real ''k''-dimensional column vector and &lt;math&gt;|\boldsymbol\Sigma|\equiv \det\boldsymbol\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[determinant]] of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. The equation above reduces to that of the univariate normal distribution if &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;1 \times 1&lt;/math&gt; matrix (i.e. a single real number).

The circularly symmetric version of the [[complex normal distribution]] has a slightly different form.

The beginning of the four &quot;[[astrological age]]s&quot; of the historical period are marked with their [[zodiac symbol]]s: the Age of Taurus from the [[Chalcolithic]] to the [[Early Bronze Age]], the Age of Aries from the [[Middle Bronze Age]] to [[Classical Antiquity]], the Age of Pisces from [[Late Antiquity]] to the present, and the Age of Aquarius beginning in the mid-3rd millennium.]]

The north and south '''celestial poles''' are the two imaginary points in the sky where the [[Earth]]'s [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]], indefinitely extended, intersects the [[celestial sphere]]. The north and south celestial poles appear permanently directly overhead to observers at the Earth's [[North Pole]] and [[South Pole]], respectively. As the Earth spins on its axis, the two celestial poles remain fixed in the sky, and all other celestial points appear to rotate around them, completing one circuit per day (strictly, per [[sidereal time|sidereal day]]).

The celestial poles are also the poles of the celestial [[equatorial coordinate system]], meaning they have [[declination]]s of +90 degrees and &amp;minus;90 degrees (for the north and south celestial poles, respectively). Despite their apparently fixed positions, the celestial poles in the long term do not actually remain permanently fixed against the background of the stars. Because of a phenomenon known as the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the poles trace out circles on the celestial sphere, with a period of about 25,700 years. The Earth's axis is also subject to other complex motions which cause the celestial poles to shift slightly over cycles of varying lengths (see [[astronomical nutation|nutation]], [[polar motion]] and [[axial tilt]]). Finally, over very long periods the positions of the stars themselves change, because of the stars' [[proper motion]]s.

An analogous concept applies to other planets: a planet's celestial poles are the points in the sky where the projection of the planet's axis of rotation intersects the celestial sphere. These points vary because different planets' axes are oriented differently (the apparent positions of the stars also change slightly because of [[parallax]] effects).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Kaler Professor Emeritus of Astronomy, University of Illinois|title=Measuring the sky A quick guide to the Celestial Sphere|url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/celsph.html|accessdate= 10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finding the north celestial pole==
[[File:Star Trails Shoreline.jpg|left|thumb|Over the course of an evening in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], [[circumpolar star]]s appear to circle around the north celestial pole. [[Polaris]] (within 1° of the pole) is the nearly stationary bright star just to the right of center in this [[star trail]] photo.]]
{{See also|Pole star|Polar alignment}}

The north celestial pole currently is within one degree of the bright star [[Polaris]] (named from the [[Latin]] ''stella polaris'', meaning &quot;[[pole star]]&quot;). This makes Polaris, colloquially known as the &quot;North Star&quot;, useful for navigation in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]: not only is it always above the north point of the horizon, but its [[altitude|altitude angle]] is always (nearly) equal to the observer's geographic [[latitude]] (though it can, of course, only be seen from locations in the Northern Hemisphere).

Polaris is near the north celestial pole for only a small fraction of the 25,700-year precession cycle. It will remain a good approximation for about 1,000 years, by which time the pole will have moved closer to Alrai ([[Gamma Cephei]]). In about 5,500 years, the pole will have moved near the position of the star [[Alderamin]] (Alpha Cephei), and in 12,000 years, [[Vega]] (Alpha Lyrae) will become the &quot;North Star&quot;, though it will be about six degrees from the true north celestial pole.

To find Polaris, from a point in the Northern Hemisphere, face north and locate the [[Big Dipper]] (Plough) and [[Little Dipper]] asterisms. Looking at the &quot;cup&quot; part of the Big Dipper, imagine that the two stars at the outside edge of the cup form a line pointing upward out of the cup. This line points directly at the star at the tip of the Little Dipper's handle. That star is Polaris, the North Star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Loyola University Chicago|title=Earth-Sky Relationships and the Celestial Sphere|url=http://www.luc.edu/faculty/dslavsk/courses/phys478/classnotes/celestial-sphere.pdf|accessdate= 10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finding the south celestial pole==
[[File:South Celestial Pole.ogv|right|thumb|400px|A series of shots show the rotation of Earth's axis relative to the south celestial pole. The [[Magellanic Clouds]] and the [[Southern Cross]] are clearly visible. Near the end of the video, the Moon rises and illuminates the scene.]]

[[File:Pole01-eng.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Locating the south celestial pole]]

The south celestial pole is visible only from the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It lies in the dim [[constellation]] [[Octans]], the Octant. [[Sigma Octantis]] is identified as the south pole star, more than one degree away from the pole, but with a magnitude of 5.5 it is barely visible on a clear night.

===Method one: The Southern Cross===

The south celestial pole can be located from the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] (Crux) and its two &quot;pointer&quot; stars [[Alpha Centauri|α Centauri]] and [[Beta Centauri|β Centauri]]. Draw an imaginary line from [[Gamma Crucis|γ Crucis]] to [[Alpha Crucis|α Crucis]]&amp;mdash;the two stars at the extreme ends of the long axis of the cross&amp;mdash;and follow this line through the sky. Either go four-and-a-half times the distance of the long axis in the direction the narrow end of the cross points, or join the two pointer stars with a line, divide this line in half, then at right angles draw another imaginary line through the sky until it meets the line from the Southern Cross. This point is 5 or 6 degrees from the south celestial pole. Very few bright stars of importance lie between Crux and the pole itself, although the constellation [[Musca]] is fairly easily recognised immediately beneath Crux.

===Method two: Canopus and Achernar===

The second method uses [[Canopus]] (the second-brightest star in the sky) and [[Achernar]]. Make a large [[equilateral triangle]] using these stars for two of the corners. The third imaginary corner will be the south celestial pole. If Canopus has not yet risen, the second-magnitude [[Alpha Pavonis]] can also be used to form the triangle with Achernar and the pole.

===Method three: The Magellanic Clouds===

The third method is best for moonless and clear nights, as it uses [[Magellanic Clouds|two faint &quot;clouds&quot;]] in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|Southern Sky]]. These are marked in astronomy books as the [[Large Magellanic Cloud|Large]] and [[Small Magellanic Cloud]]s. These &quot;clouds&quot; are actually [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] near the [[Milky Way]]. Make an equilateral triangle, the third point of which is the south celestial pole.

===Method four: Sirius and Canopus===

A line from [[Sirius]], the brightest star in the sky, through Canopus, the second-brightest, continued for the same distance lands within a couple of degrees of the pole. In other words, Canopus is halfway between Sirius and the pole.

In [[linguistics]], '''measure words''' are words (or [[morpheme]]s) that are used in combination with a numeral to indicate an amount of something represented by some [[noun]]. 

==Description==
Measure words denote a unit or measurement and are used with [[mass noun]]s (uncountable nouns), and in some cases also with [[count noun]]s. For instance, in [[English language|English]], ''{{linktext|mud}}'' is a mass noun and thus one cannot say &quot;three muds&quot;, but one can say &quot;three &lt;u&gt;drops&lt;/u&gt; of mud&quot;, &quot;three &lt;u&gt;pails&lt;/u&gt; of mud&quot;, etc. In these examples, ''drops'' and ''pails'' function as measure words. One can also say &quot;three &lt;u&gt;pails&lt;/u&gt; of shells&quot;; in this case the measure word ''pails'' accompanies a count noun (''shells'').

The term ''measure word'' is also sometimes used to refer to [[classifier (linguistics)|numeral classifiers]], which are used with count nouns in some languages. For instance, in English no extra word is needed when saying &quot;three people&quot;, but in many [[East Asian languages]] a numeral classifier is added, just as a measure word is added for uncountable nouns in English. For example, to say ''one dog'' and ''three dogs'' in Chinese, one would need to say ''yīzhīgǒu'' ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]] 一只狗, [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]] 一隻狗) and ''sānzhīgǒu'' (simplified 三只狗, traditional 三隻狗) respectively, which could be transliterated as ''one animal dog'' and ''three animal dog'' respectively. While many linguists maintain a distinction between measure words and numeral classifiers, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink1=James Tai | last=Tai | first=James H.-Y. | year=1994 | chapter=Chinese classifier systems and human categorization | editor1=William S.-Y. Wang|editor1-link=William S-Y. Wang|editor2= M. Y. Chen|editor3-link=Ovid Tzeng|editor3=Ovid J.L. Tzeng | title=In honor of William S.-Y.

The corresponding Chinese term is {{Lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|liàngcí}} ({{Zh|s=量词|t=量詞|p=}}), which can be directly translated as &quot;quantity word&quot;.

Most measure words in English correspond to [[units of measurement]] or containers, and are themselves count nouns rather than [[grammatical particle]]s:
*one ''quart'' of water
*three ''cups'' of coffee
*four ''kernels'' of corn, three ''ears'' of corn,  two ''bushels'' of corn

Though similar in construction, fractions are not measure words. For example, in &quot;seven-eighths of an apple&quot; the fraction acts as a noun. Compare that to &quot;seven slices of apple&quot; where &quot;apple&quot; is a mass noun and does not require the article &quot;an&quot;. Combining the two, e.g. &quot;seven-eighths of a slice of apple&quot;, makes it clear the fraction must be a noun referring to a part of another countable noun.

In many languages, including the East Asian languages referred to above, the analogous constructions do not include any equivalent of the English ''of''. In [[German language|German]], for example, ''ein Glas Bier'' means &quot;a glass [of] beer&quot;. This is interesting since both languages are [[West Germanic languages]], making them closely related to each other. However, the equivalent of the English ''of'' is common in [[Romance languages]] such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. In Spanish &quot;a glass of beer&quot; is &quot;un vaso &lt;u&gt;de&lt;/u&gt; cerveza&quot;, in French it is &quot;un verre &lt;u&gt;de&lt;/u&gt; bière&quot;, and in Portuguese it is &quot;um copo &lt;u&gt;de&lt;/u&gt; cerveja&quot;.

The '''retina''' (from {{lang-la|rēte}}) is the innermost, light-sensitive layer of tissue of the [[eye]] of most [[vertebrate]]s and some [[Mollusca|molluscs]]. The optics of the eye create a [[Focus (optics)|focused]] two-dimensional image of the visual world on the retina, which translates that image into electrical neural impulses to the brain to create [[visual perception]]. The retina serves a function analogous to that of the [[photographic film|film]] or [[image sensor]] in a [[camera]].

The neural retina consists of several layers of [[neuron]]s interconnected by [[Chemical synapse|synapses]] and is supported by an outer layer of pigmented epithelial cells. The primary light-sensing cells in the retina are the [[photoreceptor cell]]s, which are of two types: [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]]. Rods function mainly in dim light and provide black-and-white vision. Cones function in well-lit conditions and are responsible for the perception of colour, as well as high-acuity vision used for tasks such as reading. A third type of light-sensing cell, the [[Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]], is important for [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of circadian rhythms and reflexive responses such as the [[pupillary light reflex]].

Light striking the retina initiates a cascade of chemical and electrical events that ultimately trigger nerve impulses that are sent to various visual centres of the [[brain]] through the fibres of the [[optic nerve]]. Neural signals from the rods and cones undergo processing by other neurons, whose output takes the form of [[action potential]]s in [[retinal ganglion cell]]s whose [[axon]]s form the optic nerve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Krause's Essential Human Histology for Medical Students |last = J |first = Krause William |year=2005 |publisher = Universal Publishers |isbn = 978-1-58112-468-2 |location = Boca Raton, FL|language = English }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several important features of [[visual perception]] can be traced to the retinal encoding and processing of light.

In vertebrate [[embryonic development]], the retina and the optic nerve originate as outgrowths of the developing brain, specifically the embryonic [[diencephalon]]; thus, the retina is considered part of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and is actually brain tissue.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;&quot;Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and function of the Human Eye&quot; vol. 27, Encyclopædia Britannica, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jul06/retinput.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311163145/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jul06/retinput.htm |archivedate=11 March 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only part of the CNS that can be visualized [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures#Non-invasive procedure|non-invasively]].

== Structure ==

=== Inverted versus non-inverted retina ===
The vertebrate retina is ''inverted'' in the sense that the light sensing cells are in back of the retina, so that light has to pass through layers of neurons and capillaries before it reaches the rods and cones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolb&quot;/&gt; The ganglion cells, whose axons form the optic nerve, are at the front of the retina; therefore the optic nerve must cross through the retina en route to the brain. In this region there are no photoreceptors, giving rise to the [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolb|first1=Helga|title=Photoreceptors|url=https://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-ii-anatomy-and-physiology-of-the-retina/photoreceptors/|website=Webvision|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in the [[cephalopod]] retina the photoreceptors are in front, with processing neurons and capillaries behind them. Because of this, cephalopods do not have a blind spot.

Although the overlying neural tissue is partly transparent, and the accompanying glial cells have been shown to act as [[Optical fiber|fibre-optic]] channels to transport photons directly to the photoreceptors,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17485670&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Franze K, Grosche J, Skatchkov SN, Schinkinger S, Foja C, Schild D, Uckermann O, Travis K, Reichenbach A, Guck J |title = Muller cells are living optical fibers in the vertebrate retina |journal = Proc.

This area, termed the [[fovea centralis]], is avascular (does not have blood vessels), and has minimal neural tissue in front of the photoreceptors, thereby minimizing light scattering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bringmann2018&quot;/&gt;

The cephalopods have a non-inverted retina which is comparable in resolving power to the eyes of many vertebrates. Squid eyes do not have an analog of the vertebrate [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE). Although their photoreceptors contain a protein, retinochrome, that recycles retinal and replicates one of the functions of the vertebrate RPE, one could argue that cephalopod photoreceptors are not maintained as well as in vertebrates and that, as a result, the useful lifetime of photoreceptors in invertebrates is much shorter than in vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sperling |first1 = L. |last2 = Hubbard |first2 = R. |date = 1 February 1975 |title = Squid retinochrome. |journal = The Journal of General Physiology |volume = 65 |issue = 2 |pages = 235–251 |doi = 10.1085/jgp.65.2.235 |issn = 0022-1295 |pmid = 235007 |pmc=2214869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having easily replaced stalk-eyes (some lobsters) or retinae (some spiders, such as Deinopis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://australian.museum/learn/animals/spiders/how-spiders-see-the-world/ |title = How spiders see the world – Australian Museum |website = www.australian.museum |accessdate = 5 December 2017 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170912224747/https://australianmuseum.net.au/how-spiders-see-the-world |archivedate = 12 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) rarely occurs.

The cephalopod retina does not originate as an outgrowth of the brain, as the vertebrate one does. It is arguable that this difference shows that vertebrate and cephalopod eyes are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]] but have evolved separately. From an evolutionary perspective, a more complex structure such as the inverted retina can generally come about as a consequence of two alternate processes: (a) an advantageous &quot;good&quot; compromise between competing functional limitations, or (b) as a historical maladaptive relic of the convoluted path of organ evolution and transformation. Vision is an important adaptation in higher vertebrates.

A third view of the &quot;inverted&quot; vertebrate eye is that it combines two benefits: the maintenance of the photoreceptors mentioned above, and the reduction in light intensity necessary to avoid blinding the photoreceptors, which are based on the extremely sensitive eyes of the ancestors of modern hagfishes (a fish that lives in very deep, dark water).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Metabolism and enzyme activities of hagfish from shallow and deep water of the Pacific Ocean |date=June 2011 |volume=159 |issue=2 |pages=182–187 |journal=[[Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology|Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular &amp; Integrative Physiology]] |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2011.02.018 |pmid=21356325 |last1=Drazen |first1=J.

The signal goes first to the [[Retina bipolar cell|bipolar]] and [[Retina horizontal cell|horizontal cells]] (yellow layer), then to the [[Retina amacrine cell|amacrine cells]] and [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cells]] (purple layer), then to the optic nerve fibres. The signals are processed in these layers. First, the signals start as raw outputs of points in the rod and cone cells. Then the nerve layers identify simple shapes, such as bright points surrounded by dark points, edges, and movement. (Based on a drawing by [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal|Ramón y Cajal]], 1911.)]]

# [[Inner limiting membrane]] – basement membrane elaborated by [[Muller glia|Müller cells]].
# [[Nerve fiber layer|Nerve fibre layer]] – axons of the [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cell]] bodies (note that a thin layer of Müller cell footplates exists between this layer and the inner limiting membrane).
# [[Ganglion cell layer]] – contains nuclei of ganglion cells, the axons of which become the optic nerve fibres, and some displaced [[Retina amacrine cell|amacrine cells]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;
# [[Inner plexiform layer]] – contains the synapse between the [[Retina bipolar cell|bipolar cell]] axons and the dendrites of the [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion]] and amacrine cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;
# [[Inner nuclear layer]] – contains the nuclei and surrounding cell bodies (perikarya) of the [[amacrine cells]], [[Retina bipolar cell|bipolar cells]], and [[Retina horizontal cell|horizontal cells]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;
# [[Outer plexiform layer]] – projections of rods and cones ending in the rod spherule and cone pedicle, respectively. These make synapses with dendrites of bipolar cells and horizontal cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt; In the [[macula]]r region, this is known as the ''Fiber layer of [[Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle|Henle]]''.
# [[Outer nuclear layer]] – cell bodies of rods and cones.
# [[External limiting membrane]] – layer that separates the inner segment portions of the photoreceptors from their cell nuclei.
# Inner segment / outer segment layer – inner segments and outer segments of rods and cones. The outer segments contain a highly specialized light-sensing apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldberg AF, Moritz OL, Williams DS | title = Molecular basis for photoreceptor outer segment architecture | journal = Prog Retin Eye Res | volume = 55 | pages = 52–81 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27260426 | pmc = 5112118 | doi = 10.1016/j.preteyeres.2016.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arshavsky VY, Burns ME | title = Photoreceptor signaling: supporting vision across a wide range of light intensities | journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 287 | issue = 3 | pages = 1620–1626 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22074925 | pmc = 3265842 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.R111.305243}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[Retinal pigment epithelium]] – single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells (with extrusions not shown in diagram). This layer is closest to the choroid, and provides nourishment and supportive functions to the neural retina, The black pigment melanin in the pigment layer prevents light reflection throughout the globe of the eyeball; this is extremely important for clear vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guyton and Hall Physiology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sparrow JR, Hicks D, Hamel CP | title = The retinal pigment epithelium in health and disease | journal = Curr Mol Med | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 802–823 | date = 2010 | pmid = 21091424 | pmc = 4120883| doi = 10.2174/156652410793937813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Letelier J, Bovolenta P, Martínez-Morales JR | title = The pigmented epithelium, a bright partner against photoreceptor degeneration | journal = J Neurogenet | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 203–215 | date = 2017 | pmid = 29113536 | doi = 10.1080/01677063.2017.1395876| s2cid = 1351539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These layers can be grouped into 4 main processing stages: photoreception; transmission to [[Retina bipolar cell|bipolar cells]]; transmission to [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cells]], which also contain photoreceptors, the [[photosensitive ganglion cell]]s; and transmission along the optic nerve. At each synaptic stage there are also laterally connecting [[Retina horizontal cell|horizontal]] and [[Retina amacrine cell|amacrine cells]].

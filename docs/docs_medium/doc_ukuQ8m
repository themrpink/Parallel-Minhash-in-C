==Treatment==
[[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] seemed to have shared a belief that people frequently distressed by nightmares could be re-experiencing some stressful event from the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coalson |first1=Bob |title=Nightmare help: Treatment of trauma survivors with PTSD. |journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training |date=1995 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=381–388 |doi=10.1037/0033-3204.32.3.381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both perspectives on dreams suggest that therapy can provide relief from the dilemma of the nightmarish experience.

Halliday (1987) grouped treatment techniques into four classes. Direct nightmare interventions that combine compatible techniques from one or more of these classes may enhance overall treatment effectiveness:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cushway |first1=Delia |last2=Sewell |first2=Robyn |title=Therapy with Dreams and Nightmares: Theory, Research &amp; Practice |date=2012 |publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd |isbn=9781446247105 |page=73 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===
Recurring [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], Also known as PTSD, Nightmares in which traumas are re-experienced respond well to a technique called imagery rehearsal. This involves dreamers coming up with alternative, mastery outcomes to the nightmares, mentally rehearsing those outcomes while awake, and then reminding themselves at bedtime that they wish these alternate outcomes should the nightmares reoccur. Research has found that this technique not only reduces the occurrence of nightmares and insomnia,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15984916&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = J.

==Etymology==
[[File:John Henry Fuseli - The Nightmare.JPG|thumb|''[[The Nightmare]]'' ([[Henry Fuseli]], 1781)]]
The word &quot;nightmare&quot; is derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] &quot;[[mare (folklore)|mare]]&quot;, a mythological [[demon]] or goblin who [[Harassment|torments]] others with frightening dreams. The term has no connection with the word for &quot;[[mare|female horse]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Word Origins And How We Know Them |last=Liberman |first=Anatoly |authorlink=Anatoly Liberman |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-538707-0 |page=87 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMiRc-JFIfMC&amp;pg=PA87 |accessdate=29 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;nightmare&quot; is cognate with the Dutch term ''[[:nl:Nachtmerrie|nachtmerrie]]'' and German ''[[:de:Nachtmahr|Nachtmahr]]'' (dated).

==Myths==

There is a view, possibly featured in the story ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', that eating [[cheese]] before sleep can cause nightmares, but there is little scientific evidence for this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hammond|first=Claudia|date=17 April 2012|title=Does cheese give you nightmares?|work=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120417-does-cheese-give-you-nightmares|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nadsat''' is a fictional [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or [[argot]] used by the teenage gang members in [[Anthony Burgess]]'s dystopian novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Burgess was a [[linguistics|linguist]] and he used this background to depict his characters as speaking a form of [[Russian language|Russian]]-influenced English.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Burgess, ''[[Language Made Plain]]'' and ''[[A Mouthful of Air]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the [[Russian language|Russian]] suffix equivalent of &quot;-teen&quot; as in &quot;thirteen&quot; (-надцать, ''-nad·tsat''). Nadsat was also used in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film adaptation]] of the book.

== Description ==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2013}}
Nadsat is a mode of speech used by the ''nadsat'', members of the [[Youth subculture|teen subculture]] in the novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. The narrator and protagonist of the book, [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]], uses it in [[Grammatical person|first-person]] style to relate the story to the reader. He also uses it to communicate with other characters in the novel, such as his ''&lt;abbr title=&quot;close friends&quot;&gt;droogs&lt;/abbr&gt;'', parents, victims and any authority-figures with whom he comes in contact. As with many speakers of non-standard varieties of English, Alex is capable of speaking standard English when he wants to.  It is not a written language: the sense that readers get is of a transcription of [[vernacular]] speech.

Nadsat is English with some borrowed words from [[Russian language|Russian]]. It also contains influences from [[Rhyming slang|Cockney rhyming slang]], the [[King James Bible]], German, some words of unclear origin and some that Burgess invented. The word ''nadsat'' is the suffix of Russian numerals from 11 to 19 (-надцать). The suffix is an almost exact linguistic parallel to the English '-teen' and is derived from &quot;на&quot;, meaning &quot;on&quot; and a shortened form of &quot;десять&quot;, the number ten. &quot;Droog&quot; is Russian друг &quot;close friend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge, ''et al.'', ''The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English''; Wiktionary [[wikt:друг#Noun|друг (Russian)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the words are almost childish plays on English words, such as ''eggiweg'' (&quot;egg&quot;) and ''appy polly loggy'' (&quot;apology&quot;), as well as regular English slang ''sod'' and ''snuff it''. The word ''like'' and the expression ''the old'' are often used as [[Filler (linguistics)|fillers]] or [[discourse marker]]s.

The original 1991 translation of Burgess's book into Russian solved the problem of how to illustrate the Nadsat words by using [[transliteration|transliterated]], slang English words in places where Burgess had used Russian ones (i.e. &quot;droogs&quot; became &quot;фрэнды&quot; (''frendy''). This solution was imperfect as it lacked the original abstractness.{{by whom?|date=November 2017}} Borrowed English words with Russian inflection were widely used in Russian slang, especially among Russian [[hippie]]s in the 1970s–1980s.  Since the 1990s anglicisms in Russian have been common particularly regarding computers and programming. Future translations would simply use the original untranslated Nadsat terms.

== Function ==
Burgess, a [[polyglotism|polyglot]] who loved language in all its forms, was aware that linguistic slang was of a constantly changing nature.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Yes, [Anthony] Burgess loved to scatter polyglot obscurities like potholes throughout his more than 50 novels and dozens of nonfiction works. He could leap gaily from Welsh to French to Malay to Yiddish in one breath.&quot; Henry Kisor, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' 24 August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Burgess knew that if he used contemporarily modes of speech, the novel would very quickly become dated. His use of Nadsat was pragmatic; he needed his narrator to have a unique voice that would remain ageless while reinforcing Alex's indifference to his society's norms and to suggest that youth subculture existed independent of the rest of society. In ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', Alex's interrogators describe the source of his [[argot]] as &quot;[[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] penetration&quot;.

== Russian influences ==
Russian influences play the biggest role in Nadsat. Most of those Russian-influenced words are slightly anglicized loan-words, often maintaining the original Russian pronunciation.&lt;ref name=&quot;textual intricacies&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Oks |first=Marina |title=Textual intricacies: essays on structure and intertextuality in nineteenth and twentieth century fiction in English |year=2009 |publisher=Trier: Wiss. Verl. Trier |pages=37–56 |author2=Christiane Bimberg |chapter=The Rebus of &quot;Nadsat,&quot; or, A Key To A Clockwork Orange }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the Russian word ''Lyudi'', which is anglicized to ''lewdies'', meaning &quot;people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;real horrorshow&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=Kevin |title=Real Horrorshow: A Short Lexicon Of Nadsat |journal=Sight and Sound |year=1999 |issue=9 |pages=24–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Russian word is ''Bábushka'' which is anglicized to ''baboochka'', meaning &quot;grandmother&quot;, &quot;old woman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;real horrorshow&quot;/&gt; Some of the anglicised words are truncated, for example &quot;pony&quot; from ''ponimát’'', &quot;to understand&quot;, or otherwise shortened, for example &quot;veck&quot; from ''čelovék'', &quot;person&quot;, &quot;man&quot; (though the anglicized word &quot;chelloveck&quot; is also used in the book).

A further means of constructing Nadsat words is the employment of homophones (known as [[folk etymology]]). For example, one Nadsat term which may seem like an English composition, ''horrorshow'', actually stems from the Russian word for &quot;good&quot;; ''khorosho'', which sounds similar to ''horrorshow''.&lt;ref name=&quot;real horrorshow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;argot implications&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Evans |first=Robert O. |title=Nadsat: The Argot and its Implications in Anthony Burgess' 'A Clockwork Orange' |journal=Journal of Modern Literature |year=1971 |issue=1 |pages=406–410 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this same manner many of the Russian loan-words become an English–Russian hybrid, with Russian origins, English spellings and pronunciations.&lt;ref name=&quot;understanding Nadsat talk&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Selnon|title=Understanding Nadsat Talk in Anthony Burgess' a Clockwork Orange |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further example is the Russian word for &quot;head&quot;, ''golová'', which sounds similar to ''Gulliver'' known from ''[[Gulliver’s Travels]]''; ''Gulliver'' became the Nadsat expression for the concept &quot;head&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;real horrorshow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;argot implications&quot;/&gt;

Many of Burgess's loanwords, such as ''devotchka'' (&quot;girl&quot;) and ''droog'' (&quot;friend&quot;) maintain both their relative spelling and meaning over the course of translation.&lt;ref name=&quot;understanding Nadsat talk&quot;/&gt;

== Other influences ==
Additional words were borrowed from other languages: A (possibly Saudi-owned) hotel was named 'Al Idayyin, an Arabic-sounding variant on “Holiday Inn” Hotel chain.

== Word derivation by common techniques ==
Nadsat's English slang is constructed with common language-formation techniques. Some words are blended, others clipped or compounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;textual intricacies&quot;/&gt; In Nadsat-language a &quot;fit of laughter&quot; becomes a ''guff'' (shortened version of ''guffawing''); a &quot;[[skeleton key]]&quot; becomes a ''polyclef'' (&quot;many keys&quot;); and the &quot;state jail&quot; is blended to the ''staja''. Many common English slang terms are simply shortened.  A ''cancer stick'' which is (or was) a common English-slang expression for a &quot;cigarette&quot; is shortened to a ''cancer''.&lt;ref name=&quot;understanding Nadsat talk&quot;/&gt;

== Rhyming slang ==
; ''Charlie'' = &quot;chaplain&quot;: ''Chaplain'' and ''Chaplin'' (from [[Charlie Chaplin]]) are homophones. Using the principles of [[rhyming slang]] Burgess uses ''Charlie Chaplin'' as a synonym for &quot;chaplain&quot; and shortens it to ''Charlie''.&lt;ref name=&quot;clockwork slang&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnott |first=Luke |title=The Slang of A Clockwork Orange |year=2009 |url=https://suite.io/luke-arnott/1wsx20r |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2013}}
; ''Cutter'' = &quot;[[money]]&quot;:''Cutter'' rhymes with ''bread and butter'', a wilful alteration of ''bread and honey'' &quot;money&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;textual intricacies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;argot implications&quot;/&gt;
; ''Pretty polly'' = &quot;money&quot; : Another colloquial expression used to describe the concept &quot;money&quot; is ''lolly''. ''Lolly'' rhymes with ''pretty polly'', which is the name of an English folk song and in the world of ''A Clockwork Orange'' becomes a new expression for &quot;money&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;clockwork slang&quot;/&gt;{{better source|date=May 2013}}
;''Hound-and-horny'' = &quot;corny&quot;
;''Twenty to one'' = &quot;fun&quot; :Fun meaning gang violence in the context of the story.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

The Atbash cipher is a particular type of [[Substitution cipher|monoalphabetic cipher]] formed by taking the [[alphabet]] (or [[abjad]], [[syllabary]], etc.) and mapping it to its reverse, so that the first letter becomes the last letter, the second letter becomes the second to last letter, and so on. For example, the [[Latin alphabet]] would work like this:
{{Aligned table|cols=27|class=wikitable|col1header=on
|  Plain|  A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z
|  Cipher| Z|Y|X|W|V|U|T|S|R|Q|P|O|N|M|L|K|J|I|H|G|F|E|D|C|B|A
}}

Due to the fact that there is only one way to perform this, the Atbash cipher provides no [[communications security]], as it lacks any sort of [[Key (cryptography)|key]]. If multiple [[collation|collating orders]] are available, which one was used in encryption can be used as a key, but this does not provide significantly more security, considering that only a few letters can give away which one was used.

== History ==

The name derives from the first, last, second, and second to last Hebrew letters ([[Aleph]]–[[Taw]]–[[Bet (letter)|Bet]]–[[Shin (letter)|Shin]]).

The Atbash cipher for the modern Hebrew alphabet would be:
{{Aligned table|cols=23|class=wikitable|col1header=on|rowstyle=text-align:center;
|      |{{small|Aleph}}|{{small|Bet}}|{{small|Gimel}}|{{small|Daleth}}|{{small|Heh}}|{{small|Vav}}|{{small|Zayin}}|{{small|Het}}|{{small|Tet}}|{{small|Yodh}}|{{small|Kaph}}|{{small|Lamed}}|{{small|Mem}}|{{small|Nun}}|{{small|Samech}}|{{small|Ayin}}|{{small|Peh}}|{{small|Tzady}}|{{small|Koof}}|{{small|Reish}}|{{small|Shin}}|{{small|Taw}}

=== In the Bible===
Several [[biblical]] verses are described by commentators&lt;ref group=n&gt;[[Rashi]] and [[Radak]] on each of the first three verses. Also other commentators.&lt;/ref&gt; as being examples of Atbash:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fnKNa7cfOoC&amp;q=Atbash++&amp;pg=PT1996 |title=The Moody Bible Commentary |first1=Michael |last1=Rydelnik |first2=Michael |last2=Vanlaningham |date=March 15, 2014 |publisher=Moody Publishers |isbn=9780802490186 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jeremiah 25:26]] – &quot;The king of ''[[Sheshach]]'' shall drink after them&quot; – Sheshach meaning [[Babylon]] in Atbash ({{Script/Hebrew|בבל}} ''bbl'' → {{Script/Hebrew|ששך}} ''ššk'').
* [[Jeremiah 51:1]] – &quot;Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against the inhabitants of ''Lev-kamai'', a destroying wind.&quot; – Lev-kamai meaning [[Chaldea]]ns ({{Script/Hebrew|כשדים}} ''kšdym'' → {{Script/Hebrew|לבקמי}} ''lbqmy'').
* [[Jeremiah 51:41]] – &quot;How has ''Sheshach'' been captured! and the praise of the whole earth taken! How has Babylon become a curse among the nations!&quot; – Sheshach meaning Babylon ({{Script/Hebrew|בבל}} ''bbl'' → {{Script/Hebrew|ששך}} ''ššk'').
* {{Bibleverse|Exodus|20:20|HE}} - &quot;Any place ''I'' will mention My name&quot; ({{Script/Hebrew|אזכיר}}) → &quot;Any place ''you'' will mention My name&quot; ({{Script/Hebrew|תזכיר}}) (a → t), according to [[Yom Tov Asevilli]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Shmuel_on_Avot.3.6.1?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en Midrash Shmuel on Avot 3:6]; see discussion in [[David Zvi Hoffmann]] [https://mg.alhatorah.org/Parshan/R._David_Zvi_Hoffmann/Shemot/20.20#m7e0n6 to Exodus 20:20] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to the affine cipher ==
The Atbash cipher can be seen as a special case of the [[affine cipher]].

Under the standard affine convention, an alphabet of ''m'' letters is mapped to the numbers 0, 1, ... , ''m'' − 1. (The Hebrew alphabet has ''m'' = 22, and the standard Latin alphabet has ''m'' = 26). The Atbash cipher may then be enciphered and deciphered using the encryption function for an affine cipher by setting ''a'' = ''b'' = (''m'' − 1):

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(x) = \mathrm{D}(x) = \big((m - 1) x + (m - 1)\big) \bmod m.&lt;/math&gt;

This may be simplified to
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \mathrm{E}(x) &amp;= (m - 1)(x + 1) \bmod m \\
               &amp;= -(x + 1) \bmod m.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If, instead, the ''m'' letters of the alphabet are mapped to 1, 2, ... , ''m'', then the encryption and decryption function for the Atbash cipher becomes
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(x) = (-x \bmod m) + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

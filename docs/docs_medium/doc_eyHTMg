The '''Passover Seder''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|d|ər|}} ({{lang-he-n|סֵדֶר}} {{IPA-he|ˈsedeʁ|}} 'order, arrangement'; {{lang-yi|סדר}} {{lang|yi-Latn|seyder}}) is a ritual feast that marks the beginning of the [[Jewish holiday]] of [[Passover]]. It is conducted throughout the world on the eve of the 15th day of [[Nisan]] in the [[Hebrew calendar]] (i.e., at the start of the 15th; a Hebrew day begins at sunset).  The day falls in late March or in April of the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the Passover lasts for seven days in Israel and eight days outside Israel. Jews generally observe one or two seders: in Israel, one seder is observed on the first night of Passover; many Diaspora communities hold a seder also on the second night. The Seder is a ritual performed by a community or by multiple generations of a family, involving a retelling of the story of the liberation of the [[Israelites]] from [[slavery]] in [[ancient Egypt]].  This story is in the [[Book of Exodus]] (''Shemot'') in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The Seder itself is based on the [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] verse [[613 Mitzvot|commanding]] Jews to retell the story of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]: &quot;You shall tell your child on that day, saying, 'It is because of what [[Tetragrammaton|the LORD]] did for me when I came out of Egypt.'&quot; (Exodus 13:8) Traditionally, families and friends gather in the evening to read the text of the [[Haggadah of Pesach|Haggadah]], an ancient work derived from the [[Mishnah]] (''[[Pesahim]]'' 10).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Haggadah, Passover.&quot; Ernst Goldschmidt, Bezalel Narkiss, Bezalel Narkiss, Joseph Gutmann, Robert Weltsch, Bezalel Narkiss, Joseph Gutmann, Cecil Roth, Hanoch Avenary, and Jody Myers.

Seder customs include telling the story, discussing the story, drinking four cups of wine, eating [[matza]], partaking of symbolic foods placed on the [[Passover Seder Plate]], and reclining in celebration of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, ''Pesachim'' 99b&lt;/ref&gt; The Seder is the most commonly celebrated Jewish ritual, performed by Jews all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjU0HgLqw6Q&amp;ebc=ANyPxKqQk8qvp05BpoHvDK_flrddZUNI8ujPaT1pngxGlYDAkUgh-ynGf770cD8YQcOy2KBrrTc6mykDUXmgtcuJIZlW3OgEpQ|title=David Blumenthal on the Popularity of the Seder Due to the Manner of Its Celebration|publisher=Pitts Theology Library, Emory University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many Jewish holidays revolve around the synagogue, the Seder is conducted in the family home, although communal Seders are also organized by synagogues, schools and community centers, some open to the general public. It is customary to invite guests, especially strangers and the needy. The Seder is integral to Jewish faith and identity: as explained in the Haggadah, if not for [[Miracle|divine intervention]] and the Exodus, the Jewish people would still be [[slaves]] in Egypt. Therefore, the Seder is an occasion for praise and thanksgiving and for re-dedication to the idea of liberation. Furthermore, the words and rituals of the Seder are a primary vehicle for the transmission of the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] from grandparent to child, and from one generation to the next. Attending a Seder and eating matza on Passover is a widespread custom in the Jewish community, even among those who are not religiously observant.

[[File:1850ukr pesah.jpg|thumb|265px|A Ukrainian 19th-century [[lubok]] representing the Seder table]]
The Seder table is traditionally set with the finest place settings and silverware, and family members come to the table dressed in their holiday clothes. There is a tradition for the person leading the Seder to wear a white robe called a [[kittel]].&lt;ref name=MB&gt;Mishnah Berurah, 472:13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eider&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eider |first=Shimon |author-link=Shimon Eider |title=Halachos of Pesach |publisher=Feldheim publishers |isbn=978-0-87306-864-2|year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first half of the Seder, each participant will only need a plate and a wine glass. At the head of the table is a Seder plate containing various symbolic foods that will be eaten or pointed out during the course of the Seder. Placed nearby is a plate with three [[matzo]]t and dishes of salt water for dipping.

Each participant receives a copy of the Haggadah, which is often a traditional version: an ancient text that contains the complete Seder service. Men and women are equally obliged and eligible to participate in the Seder.&lt;ref name=chinuch&gt;sefer hachinuch, mi tzvah 21&lt;/ref&gt; In many homes, each participant at the Seder table will recite at least critical parts of the Haggadah in the original Hebrew and Aramaic. [[Halakha]] (the collective body of Jewish religious laws) requires that certain parts be said in language the participants can understand, and critical parts are often said in both Hebrew and the native language. The leader will often interrupt the reading to discuss different points with his or her children, or to offer a Torah insight into the meaning or interpretation of the words.

In some homes, participants take turns reciting the text of the Haggadah, in the original Hebrew or in translation. It is traditional for the head of the household and other participants to have pillows placed behind them for added comfort. At several points during the Seder, participants lean to the left – when drinking the four cups of wine, eating the Afikoman, and eating the korech sandwich.&lt;ref name=Eider /&gt;

Jews generally observe one or two seders: in Israel, one seder is observed on the first night of Passover; many [[Jewish Diaspora|Diaspora]] communities, sometimes excluding [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] Jews, hold a seder also on the second night. Seders have been observed around the world, including in remote places such as high in the Himalaya mountains in [[Kathmandu, Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;April 14, 2014, Israel National News, [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/291149#.U6ixzpRX9pA Volunteers Save Kathmandu Seder], Accessed June 22, 2014, &quot;...Chabad house, which is expecting over 1,000 people for Monday night's seder...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;April 15th, 2014, Global Post, [http://www.globalpost.com/photo-galleries/planet-pic/6122264/kathmandu-jerusalem-how-jews-around-the-world-are-celebrating-passover From Kathmandu to Jerusalem, how Jews around the world are celebrating Passover], Accessed June 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes of the Seder==

===Slavery and freedom===
[[File:Matzah.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Machine-made [[matzo]]]]
The rituals and symbolic foods evoke the twin themes of the evening: slavery and freedom. It is stated in the Hagaddah that &quot;In every generation everyone is obligated to see themselves as if they themselves came out of Egypt&quot; – i.e., out of slavery.

The rendering of time for the Hebrews was that a day began at sunset and ended at sunset. Historically, at the beginning of the 15th of [[Nisan]] in Ancient Egypt, the Jewish people were enslaved to Pharaoh. After the [[Plagues of Egypt#Death of Firstborn (11:1 - 12:36) מַכַּת בְּכוֹרוֹת|tenth plague]] struck Egypt at midnight, killing all the first-born sons from the first-born of Pharaoh to the first-born of the lowest Egyptian to all the first-born of the livestock in the land (Exodus 12:29), Pharaoh let the Hebrew nation go, effectively making them free people for the second half of the night.

Thus, Seder participants recall the slavery that reigned during the first half of the night by eating [[matzo]] (the &quot;poor person's bread&quot;), [[maror]] (bitter herbs which symbolize the bitterness of slavery), and charoset (a sweet paste representing the mortar which the Jewish slaves used to cement bricks). Recalling the freedom of the second half of the night, they eat the matzo (the &quot;bread of freedom&quot; as well as the &quot;bread of affliction&quot;) and '[[afikoman]]', and drink the four cups of wine, in a reclining position, and dip vegetables into salt water (the dipping being a sign of royalty and freedom).

===The Four Cups===
There is an obligation to drink four cups of wine during the Seder. The [[Mishnah]] says ([[Pesachim|Pes.]] 10:1) that even the poor are obliged to drink the four cups. Each cup is imbibed at a specific point in the Seder. The first is for [[Kiddush]] (קידוש), the second is for '[[Maggid]]' (מגיד), the third is for [[Birkat Hamazon]] (ברכת המזון) and the fourth is for [[Hallel]] (הלל).&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcus |first=Yossef |title=What is the significance of the four cups of wine? |url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/658520/jewish/What-is-the-significance-of-the-four-cups.htm |work=Chabad |publisher=Chabad |accessdate=20 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421031844/http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/658520/jewish/What-is-the-significance-of-the-four-cups.htm |archive-date=21 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Seder in a Nutshell |url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1751/jewish/The-Seder-in-a-Nutshell.htm |work=Chabad.org |publisher=Chabad |accessdate=20 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317234258/http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1751/jewish/The-Seder-in-a-Nutshell.htm |archive-date=17 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pessach Pesach Pascha Judentum Ungesaeuert Seder datafox.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Passover Seder table]]
[[File:Seder Plate.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Traditional arrangement of symbolic foods on a Passover Seder plate]]

The Four Cups represent the four expressions of deliverance promised by God {{bibleverse||Exodus|6:6–7|HE}}: &quot;I will bring out,&quot; &quot;I will deliver,&quot; &quot;I will redeem,&quot; and &quot;I will take.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus&quot;/&gt;

The [[Vilna Gaon]] relates the Four Cups to four worlds: this world, the [[Messiah|Messianic]] age, the world at the revival of the dead, and the [[world to come]]. The [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|MaHaRaL]] connects them to the four Matriarchs: [[Sarah]], [[Rebeccah]], [[Rachel]], and [[Leah]]. (The three [[matzo]]t, in turn, are connected to the three Patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.) [[Isaac Abrabanel|Abarbanel]] relates the cups to the four historical redemptions of the Jewish people: the choosing of Abraham, the Exodus from Egypt, the survival of the Jewish people throughout the exile, and the fourth which will happen at the end of days.

The four cups might also reflect the Roman custom of drinking as many cups as there are letters in the name of the chief guest at a meal, which in the case of the Seder is God Himself whose Hebrew name has four letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OzTorah: Four Cups of Wine|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2012/04/four-cups-of-wine/|work=Oztorah.com|publisher=Rabbi Raymond Apple|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seder plate===

The special Passover Seder plate (''ke'are'') is a special plate containing symbolic foods used during the Passover Seder. Each of the six items arranged on the plate has special significance to the retelling of the story of the Exodus from Egypt. The seventh symbolic item used during the meal – a stack of three matzot – is placed on its own plate on the Seder table.

The six items on the Seder plate are:
* ''[[Maror]]'': Bitter herbs, symbolizing the bitterness and harshness of the slavery which the Jews endured in Ancient Egypt. For ''maror'', many people use freshly grated horseradish or whole horseradish root.
* ''Chazeret'' is typically romaine lettuce, whose roots are bitter-tasting. In addition to horseradish and romaine lettuce, other forms of bitter lettuce, such as [[endive]], may be eaten in fulfillment of the [[mitzvah]], as well as green onions, dandelion greens, celery leaves, or curly parsley (but parsley and celery are more commonly used as the karpas or vegetable element).  Much depends upon whether one's tradition is Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrahi, Persian, or one of the many other Jewish ethno-cultural traditions.
* ''[[Charoset]]'': A sweet, brown, pebbly paste of fruits and nuts, representing the mortar used by the Jewish slaves to build the storehouses of Egypt.  The actual recipe depends partly on ethno-cultural tradition and partly on locally available ingredients.  Ashkenazi Jews, for example, traditionally make apple-raisin based charoset while Sephardic Jews often make date-based recipes that might feature orange or/and lemon, or even banana.
* ''[[Karpas]]'': A vegetable other than bitter herbs, usually parsley but sometimes something such as [[celery]] or cooked [[potato]], which is dipped into salt water (Ashkenazi custom), vinegar (Sephardi custom), or [[charoset]] (older custom, still common amongst [[Yemenite Jews]]) at the beginning of the Seder.
* ''[[Zeroa]]'': A roasted lamb or goat bone, symbolizing the ''korban Pesach'' (Pesach sacrifice), which was a lamb offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and was then roasted and eaten as part of the meal on Seder night.
* ''Beitzah'': A roast egg – usually a [[hard-boiled egg]] that has been roasted in a baking pan with a little oil, or with a lamb shank – symbolizing the ''korban chagigah'' (festival sacrifice) that was offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and was then eaten as part of the meal on Seder night.

===Focus on the children===
Since the retelling of the Exodus to one's child is the object of the Seder experience, much effort is made to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children and keep them awake during the meal. To that end, questions and answers are a central device in the Seder ritual. By encouraging children to ask questions, they will be more open to hearing the answers.

The most famous question which the youngest child asks at the Seder is the &quot;''[[Ma Nishtana]]''&quot; – 'Why is this night different from all other nights?' After the asking of this questions, the main portion of the Seder, ''Magid'', discusses the answers in the form of a historical review. Also, at different points in the Seder, the leader of the Seder will cover the matzot and lift their cup of wine; then put down the cup of wine and uncover the matzot – all to elicit questions from the children.&lt;ref name=manishtana&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/seder.htm |title=Judaism 101: Pesach Seder: How is This Night Different |accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sephardic tradition, the questions are asked by the assembled company in chorus rather than by a child, and are put to the leader of the seder, who either answers the question or may direct the attention of the assembled company to someone who is acting out that particular part of the Exodus.  Physical re-enactment of the Exodus during the Passover seder is common in many families and communities, especially amongst Sephardim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/pa2/passover/sephardicpassovercustoms.html|title=Sephardic Passover (Pesach) Customs and Traditions|website=www.angelfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families will follow the Haggadah's lead by asking their own questions at various points in the Haggadah and offering prizes such as nuts and candies for correct answers. The ''[[afikoman]]'', which is hidden away for the &quot;dessert&quot; after the meal, is another device used to encourage children's participation. In some families, the leader of the Seder hides the ''afikoman'' and the children must find it, whereupon they receive a prize or reward. In other homes, the children hide the ''afikoman'' and a parent must look for it; when the parents give up, the children demand a prize (often money) for revealing its location.

==Order of the Seder==
The order and procedures of the Seder are stated and printed in the text of the Passover [[Haggadah]], a copy of which is in front of all participants. Jewish children learn the following words, denoting the order of the Seder, with a rhyme and tune at their Jewish schools:

{{quote|[[#Kadeish (blessings and the first cup of wine)|Kaddesh]] ({{lang|he|קדש}}). [[#Urchatz (wash hands)|Urchatz]] ({{lang|he|ורחץ}}). [[#Karpas (appetizer)|Karpas]] ({{lang|he|כרפס}}). [[#Yachatz (breaking of the middle matzah)|Yachatz]] ({{lang|he|יחץ}}). [[#Magid (relating the Exodus)|Maggid]] ({{lang|he|מגיד}}). [[#Rohtzah (ritual washing of hands)|Rachtzah]] ({{lang|he|רחצה}}).

[[#Hallel (songs of praise)|Hallel]] ({{lang|he|הלל}}). [[#Nirtzah|Nirtzah]] ({{lang|he|נרצה}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtScroll Pesach Machzor&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gold, Avie |author2=Zlotowitz, Meir |author3=Scherman, Nosson |title=The Complete ArtScroll Machzor: Pesach|date=1990–2002|publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=978-0-89906-696-7|pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Kadeish'' (blessings and the first cup of wine)===
''Kadeish'' קדש is Hebrew Imperative for ''[[Kiddush]]''. It should be recited as soon as the synagogue services are over but not before nightfall.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtScroll Pesach Machzor&quot; /&gt; This ''Kiddush'' is similar to that which is recited on all of the [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals]], but also refers to [[matzot]] and the exodus from Egypt. Acting in a way that shows freedom and majesty, many Jews have the custom of filling each other's cups at the Seder table. The Kiddush is traditionally said by the father of the house, but all Seder participants may participate by reciting the Kiddush and drinking at least a majority of the first cup of wine.

===''Urchatz'' (wash hands)===
Technically, according to [[Jewish law]], whenever one partakes of fruits or vegetables dipped in liquid while remaining wet, one must wash one's hands if the fruit or vegetable remains wet. However, at other times of the year, one has either already washed their hands before eating bread, or dry the fruit or vegetable, in which case one need not wash their hands before eating the fruit or vegetable.

According to most traditions, no blessing is recited at this point in the Seder, unlike the blessing recited over the washing of the hands before eating bread.  However, followers of [[Rambam]] or the [[Gaon of Vilna]] do recite a blessing.

===''Karpas'' (appetizer)===
Each participant dips a vegetable into either ''salt water'' (Ashkenazi custom; said to serve as a reminder of the tears shed by their enslaved ancestors), ''vinegar'' (Sephardi custom) or ''[[charoset]]'' (older Sephardi custom; still common among Yemenite Jews). Another custom mentioned in some Ashkenazi sources and probably originating with [[Meir of Rothenburg]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} was to dip the karpas in ''wine''.

===''Yachatz'' (breaking of the middle matzah)===
Three [[matzot]] are stacked on the seder table; at this stage, the middle matzah of the three is broken in half. The larger piece is hidden, to be used later as the ''[[afikoman]]'', the &quot;dessert&quot; after the meal. The smaller piece is returned to its place between the other two matzot.

Before Magid, some Sephardi families have a custom to sing &quot;Bivhilu yatzanu mi-mitzrayim&quot;- (translated:&quot;In haste we left Egypt&quot;). While this is being sung, the head of the household walks around the table with the Seder plate and waves it over each individual's head.

===''Magid'' (relating the Exodus)===
The story of Passover, and the change from slavery to freedom is told. At this point in the Seder, Moroccan Jews have a custom of raising the Seder plate over the heads of all those present while chanting &quot;Bivhilu yatzanu mimitzrayim, halahma anya b'nei horin&quot; (In haste we went out of Egypt [with our] bread of affliction, [now we are] free people).

==== ''Ha Lachma Anya'' (invitation to the Seder) ====
{{Main|Ha Lachma Anya}}
[[File:Maurice Ascalon Pal-Bell Seder Plate.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A bronze [[matzo]] plate designed by [[Maurice Ascalon]], inscribed with the opening words of ''Ha Lachma Anya'']]
The [[matzo]]t are uncovered, and referred to as the &quot;bread of affliction&quot;. Participants declare (in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]) an invitation to all who are hungry or needy to join in the Seder. [[Halakha]] requires that this invitation be repeated in the native language of the country.

==== ''Mah Nishtanah'' (The Four Questions) ====
{{Main|the four questions}}

The [[Mishna]] details questions one is obligated to ask on the night of the seder. It is customary for the youngest child present to recite the four questions.&lt;ref name=jewfaq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/seder.htm |title=Judaism 101: Pesach Seder: How is This Night Different |accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some customs hold that the other participants recite them quietly to themselves as well. In some families, this means that the requirement remains on an adult &quot;child&quot; until a grandchild of the family receives sufficient Jewish education to take on the responsibility. If a person has no children capable of asking, the responsibility falls to their spouse, or another participant.&lt;ref name=pesachim116&gt;Talmud Bavli, Pesachim, 116a&lt;/ref&gt; The need to ask is so great that even if a person is alone at the seder they are obligated to ask themselves and to answer their own questions.&lt;ref name=pesachim116 /&gt;

''Ma nishtana ha lyla ha zeh mikkol hallaylot?''&lt;br&gt;
Why is this night different from all other nights?

# ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin ḥamets umatsa, vehallayla hazze kullo matsa.''&lt;br&gt;Why is it that on all other nights during the year we eat either leavened bread or matza, but on this night we eat only matza?
# ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin sh'ar y'rakot, vehallayla hazze maror.''&lt;br&gt;Why is it that on all other nights we eat all kinds of vegetables, but on this night we eat bitter herbs?
# ''Shebb'khol hallelot en anu matbillin afillu pa'am eḥat, vehallayla hazze sh'tei fe'amim.''&lt;br&gt;Why is it that on all other nights we do not dip [our food] even once, but on this night we dip them twice?
# ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin ben yosh'vin uven m'subbin, vehallayla hazze kullanu m'subbin.''&lt;br&gt;Why is it that on all other nights we dine either sitting upright or reclining, but on this night we all recline?

The second question substitutes for a different question, present in the mishnah but removed by later authorities due to its inapplicability after the [[destruction of the temple]]:
# &lt;li value=&quot;5&quot;&gt; ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin basar tsali shaluk umvushal, vehallayla hazze kullo tsali.''&lt;br&gt;Why is it that on all other nights we eat meat either roasted, marinated, or cooked, but on this night it is entirely roasted?&lt;/li&gt;

Roasted sacrifices were no longer possible after the destruction, and roasted meat was therefore disallowed on seder night, to avoid ambiguity.

The questions are answered with the following:
# We eat only matzah because our ancestors could not wait for their breads to rise when they were fleeing slavery in Egypt, and so they were flat when they came out of the oven.
# We eat only Maror, a bitter herb, to remind us of the bitterness of slavery that our ancestors endured while in Egypt.
# The first dip, green vegetables in salt water, symbolizes the replacing of our tears with gratitude, and the second dip, Maror in Charoses, symbolizes the sweetening of our burden of bitterness and suffering.
# We recline at the Seder table because in ancient times, a person who reclined at a meal was a free person, while slaves and servants stood.
# We eat only roasted meat because that is how the Pesach/Passover lamb is prepared during sacrifice in the Temple at Jerusalem.

The four questions have been translated into over 300 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whyisthisnight.com |title=300 Ways to Ask The Four Questions |accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Four Sons ====
The traditional Haggadah speaks of &quot;four sons&quot; – one who is wise, one who is wicked, one who is simple, and one who does not know to ask. This is based upon the rabbis of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] finding four references in the Torah to responding to your son who asks a question.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bazak&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbm-torah.org/pesach/pes68-ab.htm |title=The Four Sons |last=Bazak |first=Rav Amnon |others=David Silverberg (trans.) |work=Israel Koschitzky Virtual Beit Midrash |publisher=Yeshivat Har Etzion |accessdate=12 March 2013 |location=Alon Shvut, Israel |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518205620/http://www.vbm-torah.org/pesach/pes68-ab.htm |archive-date=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these sons phrases his question about the seder in a different way. The Haggadah recommends answering each son according to his question, using one of the three verses in the Torah that refer to this exchange.

The wise son asks &quot;What are the statutes, the testimonies, and the laws that God has commanded us to do?&quot;  One explanation for why this very detailed-oriented question is categorized as wise, is that the wise son is trying to learn how to carry out the seder, rather than asking for someone else's understanding of its meaning. He is answered fully:
&quot;You should reply to him with [all] the laws of pesach: one may not eat any dessert after the paschal sacrifice.&quot;

The wicked son, who asks, &quot;What is this service to you?&quot;, is characterized by the Haggadah as isolating himself from the Jewish people, standing by objectively and watching their behavior rather than participating. Therefore, he is rebuked by the explanation that &quot;It is because God acted for ''my'' sake when ''I'' left Egypt.&quot; (This implies that the Seder is not for the wicked son because the wicked son would not have deserved to be freed from Egyptian slavery.) Where the four sons are illustrated in the Haggadah, this son has frequently been depicted as carrying weapons or wearing stylish contemporary fashions.

The simple son, who asks, &quot;What is this?&quot; is answered with &quot;With a strong hand the Almighty led us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.&quot;

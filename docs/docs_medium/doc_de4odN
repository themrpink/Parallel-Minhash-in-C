'''United Nations trust territories''' were the successors of the remaining [[League of Nations mandate]]s and came into being when the [[League of Nations]] ceased to exist in 1946. All of the trust territories were administered through the [[United Nations Trusteeship Council]]. The concept is distinct from a [[List of territories governed by the United Nations|territory temporarily and directly governed by the United Nations]].

The one territory not turned over was [[South-West Africa]], which [[South Africa under apartheid|South Africa]] insisted remained under the League of Nations Mandate. South Africa's apartheid regime refused to commit to preparing the territory for independence and [[majority rule]], as required by the trust territory guidelines, among other objections. South-West Africa eventually gained independence in 1990 as [[Namibia]].

==Trust territories (and administering powers)==
[[File:Map of UN trust territories.png|thumb|UN trust territories by trustee]]

{{legend|#346733|Modern states composed solely of former trust territories}}
{{legend|#C6DEBD|Modern states composed partially of former trust territories}}]]
===Former German {{lang|de|Schutzgebiete}}===
All these territories previously were League of Nations mandates.

* The [[French Cameroons|Trust Territory of the Cameroons under French administration]] (French Cameroons): Achieved independence as the Republic of [[Cameroon]] in 1960.
* The [[Cameroons|Trust Territory of the Cameroons under British administration]] (British Cameroons): Somewhat smaller than the French Cameroons, this territory was administered in two parts (Northern Cameroons and [[Southern Cameroons]]). Following a [[plebiscite]], Northern Cameroons became part of [[Nigeria]] in May 1961 and Southern Cameroons joined the Republic of Cameroon in October 1961.
* The [[Territory of New Guinea]] (Australia): The north-eastern section of this island had been a League of Nations mandate, the south-eastern section had been Australian before World War I; after World War II, the two were combined into a unified [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea|entity]] for administrative purposes, although the legal distinction between the [[Papua (Australian territory)|Territory of Papua]] and the [[Territory of New Guinea]] was maintained. In 1975, the two entities were legally unified and granted independence as [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[Western New Guinea|western half]] of the [[New Guinea|island]], formerly Dutch and now part of [[Indonesia]], was never part of either territory.
* The [[Ruanda-Urundi|Trust Territory of Ruanda-Urundi]] ([[Belgium]], effectively linked to the [[Belgian Congo]]): Separately gained independence in 1962 as [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]].
* The [[Tanganyika Territory|Trust Territory of Tanganyika]] (United Kingdom): Granted independence in 1961. Federated with the former British protectorate [[Zanzibar]] in 1964 to form [[Tanzania]].
* The [[French Togoland|Trust Territory of Togoland under French administration]] (French Togoland): Became independent as [[Togo]] in 1960.
* The [[British Togoland|Trust Territory of Togoland under British administration]] (British Togoland): This territory was merged in 1956 with the British colony of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], which was granted independence as [[Ghana]] in 1957.
* The [[Western Samoa Trust Territory|Trust Territory of Western Samoa]] ([[New Zealand]]): Granted independence in 1962, known since 1997 simply as [[Samoa]].

===Former German and Japanese colonies===
[[File:TTPI UN Mission 1978.jpg|thumb|Arrival of UN Visiting Mission in [[Majuro]], [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] (1978). The sign reads &quot;Please release us from the bondage of your trusteeship agreement.&quot;]]

These territories were also former League of Nations mandates.

* The [[History of Nauru#World War II|Trust Territory of Nauru]] (Australia (in effective administrative control), [[New Zealand]] and United Kingdom): Granted independence in 1968.
* The [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] (United States): Split into the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]] (1979), the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (1979), the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]] (1978) and the [[Republic of Palau]] (1981). With the exception of the Northern Mariana Islands, which is an American [[commonwealth (United States insular area)|commonwealth]], these are all [[associated state]]s of the United States.

===Former Italian possessions===
* The [[Trust Territory of Somaliland|Trust Territory of Somaliland under Italian administration]]: Italy was appointed U.N. trustee of the former [[Italian Somaliland]] in 1950. In 1960, the Trust Territory merged with the former [[British Somaliland]] protectorate to form the [[Somali Republic]] (Somalia).

==Proposed trust territories==
* [[Korea]]: In wartime talks, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed that Korea be placed under an American–[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] trust administration. The plan was eclipsed after Roosevelt's death on 12 April 1945, although it was expressed in the December [[Moscow Conference (1945)|Moscow Conference]], and caused considerable civil unrest in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Gang Man-gil (1994). &quot;한국사 17: 분단구조의 정착 1&quot; [&quot;17 Korean history: the settlement of the division structure 1&quot;], pp. 133–137. 한길사 [Hangilsa], {{ISBN|978-89-356-0086-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Italian Libya]]: Between 1945 and 1947 the Soviet Union made various proposals that [[Tripolitania]] be placed under Soviet trusteeship for ten years, or a joint trusteeship with Britain and the United States, or that Libya as a whole become an Italian trusteeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=St John|first=Ronald Bruce|date=April 1982|title=The Soviet Penetration of Libya|journal=The World Today|volume=38|issue=4|pages=131–138|jstor=40395373}}

* [[Ryukyu Islands]] and [[Bonin Islands]]: the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] included provisions which provided the United States the right to convert its administration over the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands into a trust territory, but it never did so before sovereignty was voluntarily reverted to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20136/volume-136-I-1832-English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of East Timor}}
'''Portuguese Timor''' ({{lang-pt|Timor Português}}) refers to [[East Timor]] during the historic period when it was a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] that existed between 1702 and 1975.  During most of this period, Portugal shared the island of [[Timor]] with the [[Dutch East Indies]].

The first Europeans to arrive in the region were the Portuguese in 1515.&lt;ref name=&quot;West&quot;&gt;West, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]]s established a presence on the island in 1556, and the territory was declared a Portuguese colony in 1702. Following the beginning of the [[Carnation Revolution]] (a Lisbon-instigated decolonisation process) in 1975, [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|East Timor was invaded by Indonesia]]. However, the invasion was not recognized as legal by the United Nations (UN), which continued to regard Portugal as the legal Administering Power of East Timor. The independence of East Timor was finally achieved in 2002 following a [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor|UN-administered transition period]].&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Boxer, &quot;Portuguese Timor: A Rough Island Story, 1515-1960.&quot; ''History Today'' (May 1960) 19#5) pp 349-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early colonialists===
{{see also|Pre-colonial Timor|The Portuguese in Indonesia|Dutch East India Company}}
Prior to the arrival of European colonial powers, the island of [[Timor]] was part of the trading networks that stretched between India and China and incorporating [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. The island's large stands of fragrant [[sandalwood]] were its main commodity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz198&quot;&gt;Schwartz (1994), p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; The first European powers to arrive in the area were the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in the early sixteenth century followed by the Dutch in the late sixteenth century. Both came in search of the fabled [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] of [[Maluku islands|Maluku]]. In 1515, the Portuguese first landed near modern [[Pante Macassar]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Portuguese merchants exported sandalwood from the island until the tree nearly became extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;West&quot; /&gt; In 1556 a group of [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Dominican friar|friars]] established the village of [[Lifau]].

In 1613, the Dutch took control of the western part of the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;West&quot; /&gt; Over the following three centuries, the Dutch would come to dominate the [[Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]] with the exception of the eastern half of Timor, which would become Portuguese Timor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz198&quot;/&gt; The Portuguese introduced maize as a food crop and coffee as an export crop. Timorese systems of tax and labour control were preserved, through which taxes were paid through their labour and a portion of the coffee and sandalwood crop. The Portuguese introduced mercenaries into Timor communities and Timor chiefs hired Portuguese soldiers for wars against neighbouring tribes. With the use of the Portuguese musket, Timorese men became deer hunters and suppliers of deer horn and hide for export.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor379&quot;&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese introduced [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] to Portuguese Timor, as well as the [[Latin alphabet|Latin writing system]], the [[printing press]], and formal schooling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor379&quot;/&gt; Two groups of people were introduced to East Timor: Portuguese men, and [[Topasses]]. The [[Portuguese language]] was introduced into church and state business, and Portuguese Asians used [[Malay language|Malay]] in addition to Portuguese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor379&quot;/&gt; Under colonial policy, Portuguese citizenship was available to men who assimilated the Portuguese language, literacy, and religion; by 1970, 1,200 East Timorese, largely drawn from the aristocracy, Dili residents, or larger towns, had obtained Portuguese citizenship. By the end of the colonial administration in 1974, 30 percent of Timorese were practising [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] while the majority continued to worship spirits of the land and sky.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor379&quot;/&gt;

===Establishment of the colonial state===
[[File:António Macedo.jpg|thumb|left|Portuguese commander with local troops in [[Balibo]] (1930s)]]

In 1702, [[Lisbon]] sent its first governor, António Coelho Guerreiro,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cesa/History_of_Timor.pdf |title=Gunn (1999), ''Timor Lorosae: 500 years'' (Macau: Livros do Oriente), p.80. . |access-date=25 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324213447/http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cesa/History_of_Timor.pdf |archive-date=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Lifau]], which became the capital of all Portuguese dependencies in the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. Former capitals were [[Solor]] and [[Larantuka]]. Portuguese control over the territory was tenuous, particularly in the mountainous interior. [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars, the occasional Dutch raid, and the Timorese themselves, competed with Portuguese merchants. The control of colonial administrators was largely restricted to the [[Dili]] area, and they had to rely on traditional tribal chieftains for control and influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz198&quot;/&gt;

The capital was moved to [[Dili]] in 1769, due to attacks from the Topasses, who became rulers of several local kingdoms ([[Liurai]]). At the same time, the Dutch were colonising the west of the island and the surrounding archipelago that is now [[Indonesia]]. The border between Portuguese Timor and the [[Dutch East Indies]] was formally decided in 1859 with the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1859)|Treaty of Lisbon]]. In 1913, the Portuguese and Dutch formally agreed to split the island between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz199&quot;&gt;Schwartz (1994), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The definitive border was drawn by the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in 1916, and it remains the international boundary between East Timor and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Law in Historical Perspective|last=Verzijl|first=J.H.W.|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1973|pages=488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Portuguese, their colony of Portuguese Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century. Investment in infrastructure, health, and education was minimal. Sandalwood remained the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century. In places where Portuguese rule was asserted, it tended to be brutal and exploitative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz198&quot;/&gt;

=== Twentieth century ===
[[File:Lesser coat of arms of Portuguese Timor.svg|thumb|left|120px|Portuguese Timor Arms (1935–1975)&lt;ref name=&quot;Flags of the World&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/tl!1967.html|title=Flags of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Portuguese Timor stamp 12 (15 ) Avos Ceres.jpg|thumb|upright|Stamp of Portuguese Timor]]

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering home economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies, resulting in increased resistance to Portuguese rule in Portuguese Timor. In 1911–12, [[East Timorese rebellion of 1911–12|a Timorese rebellion]] was quashed after Portugal brought in troops from the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]], resulting in the deaths of 3,000 East Timorese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz199&quot;/&gt;

In the 1930s, the Japanese semi-governmental ''[[Nan’yō Kōhatsu]]'' development company, with the secret sponsorship of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], invested heavily in a joint-venture with the primary plantation company of Portuguese Timor, SAPT. The joint-venture effectively controlled imports and exports into the island by the mid-1930s and the extension of Japanese interests  greatly concerned the British, Dutch and Australian authorities.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;Post, '' The Encyclopedia of Indonesia in the Pacific War '', pages 560-561;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Portugal was neutral during the [[Second World War]], in December 1941, Portuguese Timor was occupied by a small British, Australian and Dutch force, to preempt a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invasion. However, the Japanese did invade in the [[Battle of Timor]] in February 1942. Under Japanese occupation, the borders of the Dutch and Portuguese were overlooked with Timor island being made a single [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) administration zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor379&quot;/&gt;  400 Australian and Dutch commandos trapped on the island by the Japanese invasion waged a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign, which tied up Japanese troops and inflicted over 1,000 casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz199&quot;/&gt; Timorese and the Portuguese helped the guerillas but following the Allies' eventual evacuation, Japanese retribution from their soldiers and Timorese militia raised in [[West Timor]] was severe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor379&quot;/&gt; By the end of the War, an estimated 40–60,000 Timorese had died, the economy was in ruins, and famine widespread.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz199&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goto.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Battle of Timor]]).

Following the Second World War, the Portuguese promptly returned to reclaim their colony, while West Timor became part of [[Indonesia]], which [[Indonesian National Revolution|secured its independence]] in 1949.

To rebuild the economy, colonial administrators forced local chiefs to supply labourers which further damaged the agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz199&quot; /&gt; The role of the [[Catholic Church]] in Portuguese Timor grew following the Portuguese government handing over the education of the Timorese to the Church in 1941. In post-war Portuguese Timor, primary and secondary school education levels significantly increased, albeit on a very low base.

Although illiteracy in 1973 was estimated at 93 percent of the population, the small educated elite of Portuguese Timorese produced by the Church in the 1960s and 1970s became the independence leaders during the [[Indonesian Occupation of East Timor|Indonesian occupation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz199&quot; /&gt;

Following a 1974 coup (the &quot;[[Carnation Revolution]]&quot;), the new [[Government of Portugal]] favoured a gradual decolonisation process for Portuguese territories in Asia and Africa. When Portuguese Timorese political parties were first legalised in April 1974, three major players emerged. The [[Timorese Democratic Union]] (UDT) was dedicated to preserving Portuguese Timor as a protectorate of Portugal, and in September announced its support for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn (1996), p. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fretilin]] endorsed &quot;the universal doctrines of socialism&quot;, as well as &quot;the right to independence&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dunn, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and later declared itself &quot;the only legitimate representative of the people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dunn, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; A third party, [[APODETI]], emerged advocating Portuguese Timor's integration with Indonesia&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, p. 62; Indonesia (1977), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; expressing concerns that an independent East Timor would be economically weak and vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 1974, [[Mário Lemos Pires]] - an Army officer - was appointed by the new Portuguese Government as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Portuguese Timor.

Meanwhile, the political dispute between the Timorese parties soon gave rise to an armed conflict, that included the participation of members of the Colonial Police and Timorese soldiers of the [[Portuguese Army]]. Unable to control the conflict with the few Portuguese troops that he had at his disposal, Lemos Pires decided to leave Dili with his staff and transfer the seat of the administration to the [[Atauro Island]] (located 25&amp;nbsp;km off Dili) in late August 1975. At the same time, he requested [[Lisbon]] to send military reinforcements, the request being responded with the sending of a warship, the NRP ''Afonso Cerqueira'', which arrived in Timorese waters in early October.

On 28 November 1975, Fretilin unilaterally declared the territory's independence, as the Democratic Republic of East Timor (''República Democrática de Timor-Leste'').

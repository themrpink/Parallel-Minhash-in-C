[[File:Japan commodity money before the 8th century.jpg|thumb|300px|Japanese commodity money before the 8th century AD: [[arrowheads]], [[rice]] grains and [[gold]] powder. This is the earliest form of [[Japanese currency]].]]

'''Commodity money''' is [[money]] whose [[Value (economics)|value]] comes from a [[commodity]] of which it is made. Commodity money consists of objects having value or use in themselves ([[Intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]]) as well as their value in buying goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This is in contrast to [[representative money]], which has little or no intrinsic value but represents something of value, and [[fiat money]], which has value only because it has been established as money by government regulation.

Examples of commodities that have been used as [[medium of exchange|media of exchange]] include [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[history of salt|salt]], [[Black pepper|peppercorns]], [[Tea brick#Use as currency|tea]],  decorated [[Belt (clothing)|belts]], [[Shell money|shells]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[cigarette]]s, [[silk]], [[candy]], [[nail_(fastener)|nail]]s, [[cocoa beans]], [[cowries]] and [[barley]]. Several types of commodity money were sometimes used together, with fixed relative [[value (economics)|values]], in various commodity [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] or [[price system]] economies.

==Aspects==

Commodity money is to be distinguished from [[representative money]], which is a certificate or token which can be exchanged for the underlying commodity, but only by a formal process. A key feature of commodity money is that the value is directly perceived by its users, who recognize the utility or beauty of the tokens as goods in themselves. 
Since payment by commodity generally provides a useful good, commodity money is similar to [[barter]], but is distinguishable from it in having a single recognized unit of exchange. {{Harv | Radford | 1945}} described the establishment of commodity money in [[Prisoner-of-war camp#World War II|P.O.W camp]]s.

{{Quote |People left their surplus clothing, toilet requisites and food there until they were sold at a fixed price in cigarettes. Only sales in cigarettes were accepted – there was no barter [...] Of food, the shop carried small stocks for convenience; the capital was provided by a loan from the bulk store of Red Cross cigarettes and repaid by a small commission taken on the first transactions. Thus the cigarette attained its fullest currency status, and the market was almost completely unified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = R.A. | last = Radford | url = http://www.albany.edu/~mirer/eco110/pow.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080717062228/http://www.albany.edu/~mirer/eco110/pow.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2008-07-17 | title = The Economic Organisation of a PoW Camp | journal = [[Economica]] | volume = 12 | issue = 48 | pages = 189–201 | year = 1945 | accessdate = 2009-05-09| doi = 10.2307/2550133 | jstor = 2550133 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Radford documented the way that this 'cigarette currency' was subject to [[Gresham's law]], [[inflation]], and especially [[deflation]].

In another example, in US prisons after smoking was banned circa 2003, commodity money has switched in many places to containers of mackerel fish fillets, which have a fairly standard cost and are easy to store. These may be exchanged for many services in prisons where currency is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122290720439096481 |newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |date= October 2, 2008 | title = Mackerel Economics in Prison Leads to Appreciation for Oily Fillets: Packs of Fish Catch On as Currency, Former Inmates Say; Officials Carp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles of commodity money inspire modern [[commodity market]]s: the effect of holding a token for a [[barrel of oil]] must be as close as possible economically to actually having the barrel at hand, despite its representation by a sophisticated range of [[financial instrument]]s.

===Metals===
{{Further|gold coin|silver coin|gold standard}}

In metallic currencies, a government [[mint (coin)|mint]] will [[coin]] money by placing a mark on metal tokens, typically [[gold]] or [[silver]], which serves as a guarantee of their weight and purity. In issuing this coinage at a face value higher than its costs, the government gains a profit known as [[seigniorage]].

The role of a mint and of coin differs between commodity money and [[fiat money]]. In commodity money, the coin retains its value if it is melted and physically altered, while in a fiat money it does not. Usually in a fiat money the value drops if the coin is converted to metal, but in a few cases the value of metals in fiat moneys have been allowed to rise to values larger than the face value of the coin. In India, for example fiat [[Rupee]]s disappeared from the market after 2007 when their content of stainless steel became larger than the fiat or face value of the coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1940319.ece | work=The Times | location = London | title=Coins run out as smugglers turn rupees into razors | first=Ashling | last=Oconnor | date=June 16, 2007 | accessdate =April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the metal in pennies (97.5% zinc since 1982, 95% copper in 1982 and before) and nickels (75% copper, 25% nickel) has a value close to, and sometimes exceeding, the fiat face value of the coin.

==History==
[[Image:Manillaokhapo.JPG|thumb|A bronze ''okpoho'' or [[manillas|manilla]], the traditional commodity money in [[West Africa]] until the 1940s.]]

Commodities often come into being in situations where other forms of money are not available or not trusted.
Various commodities were used in pre-Revolutionary America including [[wampum]], [[maize]], iron nails, beaver pelts, and [[tobacco]]. According to economist [[Murray Rothbard]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the sparsely settled American colonies, money, as it always does, arose in the market as a useful and scarce commodity and began to serve as a general medium of exchange. Thus, beaver fur and wampum were used as money in the north for exchanges with the Indians, and fish and corn also served as money. Rice was used as money in South Carolina, and the most widespread use of commodity money was tobacco, which served as money in Virginia. The pound-of-tobacco was the currency unit in Virginia, with warehouse receipts in tobacco circulating as money backed 100 percent by the tobacco in the warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]], [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard260.html Commodity Money in Colonial America], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Canada, where the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and other fur trading companies controlled most of the country, fur traders quickly realized that gold and silver were of no interest to the [[First Nations]]. They wanted goods such as metal knives and axes. Rather than use a [[barter system]], the fur traders established the [[beaver pelt]] as the standard currency, and created a price list for goods:

* 5 pounds of sugar cost 1 beaver pelt
* 2 scissors cost 1 beaver pelt
* 20 fish hooks cost 1 beaver pelt
* 1 pair of shoes cost 1 beaver pelt
* 1 gun cost 12 beaver pelts

Other animal furs were convertible into beaver pelts at a standard rate as well, so this created a viable currency in a primitive economy with limited supplies of gold, silver, and other kinds of money, but numerous fur-bearing animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fur Trade and Hudson's Bay Company |url=http://www.canadiana.ca/hbc/stories/produits2_e.html# |accessdate=2015-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108074343/http://www.canadiana.ca/hbc/stories/produits2_e.html |archivedate=2015-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long after gold coins became rare in commerce, the [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]] gold repository of the [[United States]] functioned as a theoretical backing for federally issued &quot;gold certificates&quot; representing the gold. Between 1933 and 1970 (when the U.S. officially left the [[gold standard]]), one [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] was technically worth exactly 1/35 of a [[Troy weight|troy ounce]] (889&amp;nbsp;mg) of gold. However, actual trade in gold bullion as a [[precious metal]] within the United States was banned after 1933, with the explicit purpose of preventing the &quot;hoarding&quot; of private gold during an economic depression period in which maximal circulation of money was desired by government policy. This was a fairly typical transition from commodity to representative to fiat money, with people trading in other goods being forced to trade in gold, then to receive [[paper money]] that purported to be ''as good as gold,'' and finally a [[Fiat money|fiat]] currency backed by government authority and social perceptions of value.

Cigarettes and gasoline were used as a form of commodity money in some parts of Europe, including Germany, France and Belgium, in the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Troublesome in Europe: Black Markets |newspaper=[[Leader-Post]] |location=[[Regina, Saskatchewan]] |date=1946-01-05 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YL9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gzgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5535%2C527446 |accessdate = 2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although grains such as [[barley]] have been used historically in relations of trade and barter ([[Mesopotamia]] circa 3000 BC), they can be inconvenient as a [[medium of exchange]] or a [[standard of deferred payment]] due to transport and storage concerns and eventual spoilage. Gold or other metals are sometimes used in a [[price system]] as a durable, easily warehoused store of value ([[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]]).

The use of [[barter]]-like methods using commodity money may date back to at least 100,000 years ago.{{fact|date=June 2017}} Trading in [[red ochre]] is attested in [[Swaziland]], shell jewellery in the form of strung beads also dates back to this period, and had the basic attributes needed of commodity money. To organize production and to distribute goods and services among their populations, before [[market economies]] existed, people relied on tradition, top-down command, or community cooperation. Relations of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and/or redistribution, substituted for market exchange.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The [[city-state]]s of [[Sumer]] developed a trade and [[market economy]] based originally on the commodity money of the [[Shekel]] which was a certain weight measure of barley, while the [[Babylonia]]ns and their city state neighbors later developed the earliest system of [[economics]] using a metric of various commodities, that was fixed in a legal code.&lt;ref name=&quot;yale2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hammint.asp |title=The Code of Hammurabi : Introduction |accessdate=December 8, 2015 |publisher=Yale University|year=1915|author=Charles F. Horne, Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several centuries after the invention of [[cuneiform script]], the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to codified amounts of commodity money being used in contract law, such as buying property and paying [[legal]] fines.&lt;ref name=Sheila&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dow | first1 = Sheila C. | year = 2005 | title = Axioms and Babylonian thought: a reply | url = | journal = Journal of Post Keynesian Economics | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 385–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal tender issues==
Today, the face value of specie and base-metal coins is set by government fiat, and it is only this value which must be legally accepted as payment for debt, in the jurisdiction of the government which declares the coin to be legal tender. The value of the precious metal in the coin may give it another value, but this varies over time. The value of the metal is subject to bilateral agreement, just as is the case with pure metals or commodities which had not been monetized by any government. As an example, gold and silver coins from other non-U.S. countries are specifically exempted in U.S. law from being legal tender for the payment of debts in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|31|5103}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that a seller who refuses to accept them cannot be sued by the payer who offers them to settle a debt. However, nothing prevents such arrangements from being made if both parties agree on a value for the coins.

'''Marion Franklin Tinsley''' (February 3, 1927 – April 3, 1995) was an American [[mathematician]] and [[English draughts|checkers]] player. He is considered to be the greatest checkers player who ever lived.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Robert MCG. Jr. &quot;Marion F. Tinsley, 68, Unmatched As Checkers Champion, Is Dead&quot;. ''New York Times''. 8 April 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Tinsley was world champion 1955–1958 and 1975–1991 and never lost a world championship match, and lost only seven games (two of them to the [[Chinook (draughts player)|Chinook computer program]]) from 1950 until his death in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;HumanPerfection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wylliedraughts.com/Tinsley.htm|title=Marion Tinsley: Human Perfection at Checkers?|author=Jonathan Schaeffer|authorlink=Jonathan Schaeffer|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew from championship play during the years 1958–1975, relinquishing the title during that time.  It was said that Tinsley was &quot;to checkers what Leonardo da Vinci was to science, what Michelangelo was to art and what Beethoven was to music.&quot;&lt;ref name=solved/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Tinsley was born in [[Ironton, Ohio]], and was the son of a school teacher and a farmer who became a [[sheriff]]. He had a sister and &quot;felt unloved&quot; by his parents.&lt;ref name=solved/&gt;  To gain the affection of his parents, he competed in math and spelling bees as a child.&lt;ref name=solved/&gt;  He said of his parents disapproval: &quot;And as a twig is bent, it grows: As I grew up, I still kept feeling that way.&quot;&lt;ref name=solved/&gt;

He skipped four of his first eight grades.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Checkered Career&quot;/&gt;  Tinsley had a doctorate from [[Ohio State University]] in the mathematical discipline of [[combinatorial analysis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A Checkered Career&quot;/&gt; He worked as a professor of mathematics at [[Florida State University]] and [[Florida A&amp;M University]]. Tinsley once claimed to have spent approximately 10,000 hours studying checkers while in graduate school. Tinsley also served as a [[lay preacher]] in the [[Disciples of Christ church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A Checkered Career&quot;/&gt;

==World Championship titles==
*8-time world champion (Three-move): 1954, 1955, 1958, 1979, 1981, 1985, 1987, 1989
*1-time world champion (Two-move): 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacheckers.com/worldchampionshipresults.php|title=The American Checker Federation -- Welcome to the ACF website|work=usacheckers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinook games==
Tinsley retired from championship play in 1991. In August 1992, he defeated the [[Chinook (draughts player)|Chinook computer program]] 4–2 (with 33 draws) in a match. Chinook had placed second at the U.S. Nationals in 1990, which usually qualifies one to compete for a national title. However, the [[American Checker Federation|American Checkers Federation]] and the [[English Draughts Association]] refused to allow a computer to play for the title. Unable to appeal their decision, Tinsley resigned his title as World Champion and immediately indicated his desire to play against Chinook. The unofficial yet highly publicized match was quickly organized, and was won by Tinsley.

In one game from their match in 1990, Chinook, playing with white pieces, made a mistake on the tenth move. Tinsley remarked, &quot;You're going to regret that.&quot;  Chinook resigned after move 36, only 26 moves later. The lead programmer [[Jonathan Schaeffer]] looked back into the database and discovered that Tinsley picked the only strategy that could have defeated Chinook from that point and Tinsley was able to see the win 64 moves into the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Schaeffer]] and Robert Lake.  &quot;[http://www.msri.org/publications/books/Book29/files/schaeffer.pdf Solving the Game of Checkers].&quot;  ''[[Games of No Chance]]'', vol. 29, 1996, p. 129-130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot;&gt;&quot;Dr Marion Tinsley: [http://yellowmagpie.com/dr-marion-tinsley-draughts/ The Checkers Mathematician]&quot;, YellowMagpie&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACF and the EDA were placed in the awkward position of naming a new world champion, a title which would be worthless as long as Tinsley was alive. The ACF granted Tinsley the title of World Champion Emeritus as a solution.

In August 1994, a second match with Chinook was organized, but Tinsley withdrew after only six games (all draws) for health reasons. [[Don Lafferty]], rated the number two player in the world at the time, replaced Tinsley and fought Chinook to a drawn match at game 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.wisc.edu/~propp/chinook.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829085713/http://www.math.wisc.edu/~propp/chinook.html |title=Chinook (ACJ Extra)|archivedate=29 August 2006|work=wisc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tinsley was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] a week after the match, and died seven months later.

==Death==
Tinsley died in [[Humble, Texas]], on April 3, 1995, at the age of 68.  He lived in [[Conyers, Georgia]], but was visiting his sister in Texas when he died of cancer. He was survived by a twin sister, Mary Clark, who lives in Humble, Texas, and by two brothers, Ed, of [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota, Fla.]], and Joe, of [[Thornville, Ohio]].&lt;ref name = nccheckers/&gt; He is buried at Greenlawn Cemetery, [[Columbus, Ohio]], next to his father, Edward H. Tinsley, who was buried on November 19, 1948, and his mother, Viola Mae Tinsley, who was buried on June 1, 1987. His brother, Harold Edward Tinsley is also buried there, and was buried on July 6, 2007.&lt;ref name = nccheckers&gt;{{cite web|title=Marion F.

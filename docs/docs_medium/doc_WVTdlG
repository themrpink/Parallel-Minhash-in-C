[[Image:Vault figure.jpg|thumb|right]]The '''vault''' is an [[artistic gymnastics]] apparatus which [[gymnast]]s perform on, as well as the skill performed using that apparatus. Vaulting is also the action of performing a vault. Both male and female [[gymnast]]s perform the vault. The English abbreviation for the event in gymnastics scoring is VT.

== The apparatus ==
[[File:Nederlandse kampioenschap turnen dames in Leiden Bep Ipenburg tijdens paardoefen, Bestanddeelnr 910-8764.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Original vaulting horse configuration (women)]]
[[File:Jaarlijkse turnwedstrijden Steenwedstrijden in de Amsterdamse turnhal, winnaar, Bestanddeelnr 910-8900.jpg|thumb|Original vaulting horse configuration (men)]]
Early forms of the vault were invented by German [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]]. The apparatus itself originated as a &quot;horse&quot;, much like the [[pommel horse]] but without the handles; it was sometimes known as the vaulting horse. The horse was set up with its long dimension perpendicular to the run for women, and parallel for men.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate&quot;&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2105452/ What's With That Weird New Vault?], an August 2004 &quot;Explainer&quot; article from ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The vaulting horse was the apparatus used in the Olympics for over a century, beginning with the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's vault|Men's vault in the first modern Olympics]] and ending with the Gymnastics at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

The horse has been blamed for several serious accidents over the years. In 1988, American [[Julissa Gomez]] was paralyzed in a vaulting accident; she died from complications from her injuries three years later.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Seal, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,6903,1654132,00.html &quot;Tales from the vaults&quot;], ''Guardian Unlimited'' December 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; During warmups at the 1998 [[Goodwill Games]], Chinese gymnast [[Sang Lan]] fell and suffered [[paralysis]] from a [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical-spine]] injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/english/MATERIAL/73748.htm &quot;Smiling Sang Lan&quot;] Xinhua News Agency, August 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of crashes when the horse's height was set too low at the 2000 Olympics, gymnasts either rammed into the horse's front end, or had bad landings after having problems with their hand placements during push-off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.espn.go.com/oly/summer00/news/2000/0924/773871.html &quot;Vault mixup could have cost gymnast medal&quot;], ''ESPN'', September 28, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the accident in 1988 and compounded by the ones in 1998 and 2000, [[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|International Gymnastics Federation (FIG)]] re-evaluated and changed the apparatus, citing both safety reasons and the desire to facilitate more impressive acrobatics.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate&quot;/&gt;  The [[2001 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] were the first international competition to make use of the &quot;vaulting table&quot;, an apparatus made by Dutch gymnastics equipment company [[Janssen-Fritsen]] since the mid-1990s. It features a flat, larger, and more cushioned surface almost parallel to the floor, which slopes downward at the end closest to the [[springboard (gymnastics)|springboard]]; gymnasts nicknamed it the &quot;tongue&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;slate&quot;/&gt; it appears to be somewhat safer than the old apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vault: Everything You Need to know about Vault |url= http://gymnastics.about.com/od/gymnasticsapparatus/p/watchingvault.htm |date= |accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Dutch junior gymnast [[Imke Glas]] was seriously injured after a fall on a vault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EenVandaag: Het wonder Imke Glas |url= http://www.eenvandaag.nl/binnenland/33698/het_wonder_imke_glas |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2009-10-04 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Routines ==
[[File:Vault - multiple exposures.jpg|thumb|300px|A multiple-exposure image of a gymnast performing a vault ([[Handspring (gymnastics)|handspring]] double front [[Somersault|salto]] tucked) during the 2012 Olympics.]]
To perform a vault, the gymnast runs down a runway (the run), which is usually padded or carpeted. They hurdle onto a [[springboard (gymnastics)|springboard]] and spring onto the vault with their hands (the preflight or first flight, and block). For vaults in the [[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko]] family, the gymnast will put their hands onto a mat that is placed before the springboard, round-off onto the board, and do a back handspring onto the vault. The off-flight may be as simple as leaping over the apparatus or as complicated as executing several twists and turns in the air. The gymnast then lands on the mat on the other side of the apparatus.

=== Scoring and rules ===
Gymnasts are expected to land cleanly, with no hops or steps, and within a set landing zone on the landing mat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MAG Code of Points 2009-2012 |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1205 |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=85 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001002145/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1205 |archive-date=2009-10-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vt&gt;{{cite web |title=WAG Code of Points 2009-2012 |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1258 |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |pages=22–23 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219204732/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1258 |archive-date=2011-12-19 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; They must also demonstrate good technique and execution in the actual vault. Falling or stepping on landing incurs deduction, as will lack of height off the table, or distance from the table.&lt;ref name=vt /&gt;&lt;ref name=magvt&gt;{{cite web |title=MAG Code of Points 2009-2012 |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1205 |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |pages=87–88 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001002145/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1205 |archive-date=2009-10-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gymnasts (both male and female) show one vault in Qualification, Team Final, and All Around Final. If the gymnast wishes to qualify for vault apparatus finals, they must perform a second vault during qualifications.&lt;ref name=vt /&gt;&lt;ref name=vtrules&gt;{{cite web |title=MAG Code of Points 2009-2012 |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1205 |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=86 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001002145/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1205 |archive-date=2009-10-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Apparatus Finals gymnasts must also show two vaults.&lt;ref name=vt /&gt;&lt;ref name=vtrules /&gt;  For men, the two vaults must be from different element groups,&lt;ref name=vtrules /&gt; while women must show two vaults with different repulsion and flight phase from the vault table.&lt;ref name=vt /&gt;

==== Apparatus specific rules ====
Yurchenko-style vaults must be performed with a safety collar placed around the springboard. If the collar is not used, the vault is considered invalid and the gymnast will receive a score of zero.&lt;ref name=vt /&gt;&lt;ref name=magvt /&gt;

Every vault is assigned a specific number; this number is displayed on a board or electronic screen before the gymnast begins. Gymnasts will be penalized if they fail to show the number of their intended vault, though there is no penalty if the vault ends up being different (e.g., not performing enough twists).&lt;ref name=vt /&gt;&lt;ref name=vtrules /&gt;

If a female gymnast balks, for example stops in the middle of the runway or breaks her run before touching the springboard, no deductions are taken. The gymnast is given thirty seconds to return to the end of the runway and make a second attempt at the vault. If, however, the gymnast touches any portion of the springboard or vault itself, she receives a score of zero and may not make another attempt.&lt;ref name=vt /&gt; Ekaterina Kramarenko touched the vault and was given a zero during the team final at the 2007 World Championship. A male gymnast receives a score of 0 if he does not vault once he starts running.&lt;ref name=magvt /&gt;  Both male and female gymnasts receive a score of 0 if they fail to land on their feet first.&lt;ref name=vt /&gt;&lt;ref name=magvt /&gt;

Receiving spotting assistance from a coach, or not touching the vault table will result in a score of 0.&lt;ref name=vt /&gt;&lt;ref name=magvt /&gt; Vaulting before the judge has signaled the gymnast can vault once also resulted in a score of 0; this deduction has since been removed. An example of this would be at the Beijing [[2008 Summer Olympics]] to [[Anna Pavlova (gymnast)|Anna Pavlova]] during the Vault event final on her second vault.

==== Judging and scoring ====
Because the vault is completed so quickly it helps if there are cameras to play back in slow motion if they are unsure or if all the judges have a wide range of scores. It is the head judges' job to make sure all the scores are within a certain range, usually 0.2 point range difference. Judges look through four main phases: the pre-flight, support, after-flight, and landing. The overall vault of a gymnast should have power and speed, while being explosive and precise as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;gymnasticsontario&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Artistic|url=http://www.gymnasticsontario.ca/about-gymnastics/womens-artistic-wag/|publisher=Gymnastics Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman's competition score is the combined average score of the two vaults she performs. Scoring has become very different in these past years. No event is scored out of ten. The new system was designed in 2005. The judges evaluate the projected difficulty of the routine and the actual skills executed to determine the final score. The projected difficulty is increased with every skill included. Each skill has its own value; the harder the skill the higher the start value. The execution is out of 10.0, looking at the form, height, length, and the landing.&lt;ref name=&quot;gymnasticsontario&quot;/&gt; Then in 2009, FIG made some changes to put less emphasis on the difficulty and reduce the amount of skills required, making the gymnasts focus harder on perfect execution of the vault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Gymnastics:Women's Gymnastics Rules and Judging|url=http://gymnastics.about.com/od/majorcompetitions/a/WomensRules.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vault families ==
Vault styles are broken into various groups or families.  The group a vault style fits into is determined by the action performed during the vaulting movement.
{{Col-start-fixed}}
{{Col-break}}

=== Vault groups (men) ===
There are five vault categories for men:
*Direct vaults
*Vaults with 1/1 turn in the first flight phase
*Handspring and Yamashita-style vaults
*Vaults with 1/4 to 1/2 turn in the 1st flight phase ([[Tsukahara (vault)|Tsukahara]])
*Round-off entry vaults ([[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko]])
{{Col-break}}

=== Vault groups (women) ===
There are five vault categories for women:
*Handspring, Yamashita, round-off with or without longitudinal-axis (LA) turn in 1st and/or 2nd flight phase
*Handspring forward with/without 360° turn in 1st flight phase, salto forward with/without LA turn in 2nd flight phase
*[[Tsukahara (vault)|Tsukahara]]-style vaults
*[[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko]]-style vaults
*Round-off with ½ LA turn in 1st flight phase, salto forward with or without LA turn in 2nd flight phase ([[Khorkina]]-style vaults)
{{Col-end}}
In the USA Program, women level four or five do front handsprings on vault whereas men do not compete the skill until level six. Women level three do handstand flatbacks on vault opposed to men who perform a straight jump at level four and a front tuck at level five onto stacked mats. In both programs level seven all the way to elite can perform a variety of vaults.

[[File:FabianHambuechen-WM07.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fabian Hambüchen]] at the horizontal bar]]
[[File:Bar grip front.jpg|right|thumb|A bar grip (front view)]]

The '''horizontal bar''', also known as the '''high bar''', is an apparatus used by [[male]] [[gymnast]]s in [[artistic gymnastics]]. It traditionally consists of a cylindrical [[metal]] (typically [[steel]]) bar that is rigidly held above and parallel to the floor by a system of cables and stiff vertical supports. Gymnasts typically wear suede leather [[grip (gymnastics)|grip]]s while performing on the bar.  Current elite-level competition uses a more elastic [[fiberglass]] core rail similar in material to the rails used in the women's [[uneven bars]] and men's [[parallel bars]] apparatus.

The gymnastics elements performed on the horizontal bar are regulated by a [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]]. A bar routine, which is a sequence of several bar skills, usually includes [[giant (gymnastics)|giant]]s with various grips (overgrip, undergrip, dorsal grip, mixed grip), in-bar work, turns, release and regrasp skills, and a dismount. The horizontal bar is often considered one of the most exciting gymnastics events due to the power exhibited by gymnasts during giant swings and spectacular aerial releases and dismounts that often include multiple [[flip (acrobatic)|flips]] or twists and, in some cases, airborne travel over the bar.

== History ==
The horizontal bar was used by [[Acrobatics|acrobat]]s in [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and on through the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=Butterworth1902&gt;{{Citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=O95AAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |title= The Horizontal Bar |first= Horace |last= Butterworth |year= 1902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced into gymnastics by [[Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuths]] in his 1793 book ''Gymnastik für die Jugend'', which in turn inspired further use and development by [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] in 1811.&lt;ref name=Butterworth1902/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodbody&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodbody |first=John |title=The Illustrated History of Gymnastics |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedhisto0000good |url-access=registration |publisher=Stanley Paul &amp; Co. |location=London |date=1982 |isbn=0-09-143350-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/illustratedhisto0000good/page/n95 11]–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions==

The mechanical dimensions of the horizontal bar apparatus are specified in [[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]]'s ''Apparatus Norms'' brochure:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/publicdir/rules/files/en_Apparatus%20Norms.pdf|title=Apparatus Norms for gymnastics (2017)|date=2019-07-20|website=International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720194311/http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/publicdir/rules/files/en_Apparatus%20Norms.pdf|archive-date=2019-07-20|url-status=|access-date=2019-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grips==
{{confusing|section|date=August 2012}}
The manner in which the horizontal bar is grasped by a gymnast is called the ''grip'' (not to be confused with the suede leather grips that are worn on the hands). Each grip is commonly used for a particular set of skills. When gymnasts compete on the horizontal bar they are often required by the [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]] to use specific grips.

* The '''overhand grip''', or ''regular grip'', is the standard grip used for the horizontal bar. On the overhand grip the hands circle the bar with the backs of the hands facing the gymnast.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Sands and Mike Conklin, ''Everybody's Gymnastics Book'', (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1966), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A ''dorsal grip'' (also known as the dorsal hang) is an overhand grip employed while the gymnast's legs pass through the arms into a &quot;skin the cat&quot; position.&lt;ref name=Sands&gt;Sands and Conklin, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The overhand grip is used in giant swings, and the dorsal grip in German Giant Swings.&lt;ref&gt;Newton C. Loken and Robert J. Willoughby,''The Complete Book of Gymnastics,'' 6th ed., (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1977), 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''reverse grip'' and ''underhand grip'', is the opposite of the overhand grip. The palms of the hands face the gymnast. It is similar to the grip used in chin-ups. Forward giant swings are among the skills that use this grip.
* The ''elgrip'' is also an ''underhand grip'', In an ''elgrip'' or ''L-Grip'' or eagle grip a gymnasts hands are turned 180 degrees outward from an over grip. Thumbs are turned out, but in the opposite direction of an undergrip. This position requires flexible shoulders to swing comfortably.
* The '''mixed grip''' is a combination of the overhand and underhand grips with one hand in each position. This grip can be used to gain more height on release skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/teachingfundamen0000mitc|url-access=registration|quote=gymnastics horizontal bar  mixed grip.|title=Teaching Fundamental Gymnastics Skills|last1=Mitchell|first1=Debby|last2=Davis|first2=Barbara|last3=Lopez|first3=Raim|date=2002|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9780736001243|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/teachingfundamen0000mitc/page/237 237]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perch''' is a common name for [[fish]] of the genus '''''Perca''''', freshwater [[gamefish]] belonging to the family [[Percidae]].  The perch, of which  three species occur in different geographical areas, lend their name to a large order of [[vertebrate]]s: the [[Perciform]]es, from the {{lang-el|πέρκη}} ({{transl|el|perke}}), simply meaning perch, and the [[Latin]] ''forma'' meaning shape.  Many species of freshwater gamefish more or less resemble perch, but belong to different genera. In fact, the exclusively saltwater-dwelling [[red drum]] is often referred to as a red perch, though by definition perch are freshwater fish. Though many fish are referred to as perch as a common name, to be considered a true perch, the fish must be of the family Percidae.

The [[type species]] for this genus is the [[European perch]], ''P. fluviatilis''.

==Species==
Most authorities recognize three species within the perch genus:
* The [[European perch]] (''P. fluviatilis'') is found in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. This species is typically greenish in color with dark vertical bars on its sides with a red or orange coloring in the tips of its fins. The European perch has been successfully introduced in [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], where it is known as the redfin perch or English perch. In Australia, larger specimens have been bred, but the species rarely grows heavier than {{convert|6|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}}.
* The [[Balkhash perch]] (''P. schrenkii'') is found in [[Kazakhstan]], (in [[Lake Balkhash]] and [[Lake Alakol]]), [[Uzbekistan]], and [[China]]. It is very similar to the European perch, and grows to a comparable size.
* The [[yellow perch]] (''P. flavescens''), smaller and paler than the [[European perch]], is found in [[North America]]. In northern areas, it is sometimes referred to as the lake perch. This species is prized for its food quality and has often been raised in hatcheries and introduced into areas in which it is not native. Yellow perch are almost identical in appearance to European perch, but have a more yellow coloring. These fish typically only reach a size of about {{convert|15|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1|kg|lboz|abbr=on}}.

==Anatomy==

The general body type of a perch is somewhat long and rounded. True perch have &quot;rough&quot; or [[ctenoid]] scales. On the anterior side of the head are the maxilla and lower mandible for the mouth, a pair of [[nostril]]s, and two lidless [[eye]]s. On the posterior sides are the [[Operculum (fish)|opercular series]], which protect the [[gill]]s, and the [[lateral line]] system, which is sensitive to [[vibrations]] in the water. The kidney of the perch runs along the backbone and forms a head, caudal to the gills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weatherley|first=A. H.|date=1963-03-01|title=A Note on the Head Kidney and Kidney of the Perch Perca Fluviatilis (linnaeus), with Special Reference to the Blood Vascular System|journal=Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London|language=en|volume=140|issue=2|pages=161–167|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1963.tb01859.x|issn=1469-7998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perch have paired [[Pectoral fin|pectoral]] and [[pelvic fin]]s, and two [[dorsal fin]]s, the first one spiny and the second soft. These two fins can be separate or joined.

==Habitats==

Perch are carnivorous fish most commonly found in small ponds, lakes, streams, or rivers. These fish feed on smaller fish, shellfish, or insect larvae, but can be caught with nearly any bait. They commonly spawn during the spring, when the females lay strings of eggs in covered areas such as near branches or underwater plants. Perch have a wide distribution throughout the world, and are very plentiful in the Great Lakes, especially [[Lake Erie]].

==Fishing==
Perch are a popular sport fish species. They are known to put up a fight, and to be good for eating. They can be caught with a variety of methods, including [[Fishing float|float]] fishing, lure fishing, and [[Bottom fishing|legering]]. &lt;!-- not encyclopedic how-to  Methods includ using a small hook and casting into the weeds just before the drop off. When fishing with bait, the angler will want to have a [[disgorger]]; perch are notorious for swallowing the hook, and will need aid of a [[disgorger]] or [[forceps]] for unhooking. In many parts of the world, they are also a favourite species among ice fishermen. They will take a variety of baits, including [[minnow]]s, [[worm]]s, [[maggot]]s, [[Common goldfish|goldfish]], pieces of raw [[bacon]], [[prawn]], and softshell [[crayfish]], but seem to prefer shrimp ([[Caridina]], [[Neocaridina]], [[Palaemon (genus)|Palaemon]]), [[Krill]], small fish, [[Lob worm|lobworms]], [[ragworm]]s, red [[maggot]]s, and [[Fishing lure|lure]]s.--&gt; Fly fishing for perch using patterns that imitate small fry or invertebrates can be successful. The record weight for this fish in Britain is {{convert|2.81|kg|lboz|frac=2|abbr=on}}, the Netherlands {{convert|3.05|kg|lboz|frac=2|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;https://beet.nl/record/nederlands-record-baars-56-cm/&lt;/ref&gt; and in America {{convert|2.83|kg|lboz|frac=2|abbr=on}}.

Perch grow to around {{convert|50|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5|lb|kg|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} or more, but the most common size caught are around {{convert|30|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1|lb|g|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} or less and anything over {{convert|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2|lb|g|sigfig=1|abbr=on|order=flip}} is considered a prize catch.

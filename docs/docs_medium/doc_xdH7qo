'''[[Automatic wikification]]''' is a feature that was implemented for a time in the old Wikipedia Phase II software.  It is no longer available in the new [[wikipedia:Software Phase III|Phase III]] software, due to concerns raised by some users and developers, though there is some discussion about reintroducing it.

This is a description of how the feature worked under the old Phase II software:

The &quot;working title&quot; is ''automatic wikification'', but it could also be ''wikification assistance''. The key element is a new button on the ''edit'' pages, right after ''Save'' and ''Preview''. It only appears for logged-in members, as not to confuse newcomers (this setting can, of course, be changed).

Basically, what it does is to change HTML tags to wiki tags where possible, and to alter the article source in ways the wikipedia community (with the possible exception of 24;) seems to have more or less agreed upon. Hitting the button produces the altered article source and its preview. ''It does not alter the article in the database!'' You will have to hit Save to commit the change, as usual. That way, you can check the alterations, revert some, or hit the back button in case the article got messed up.

Currently, the function is as follows:
* &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt; tags are replaced with the matching wiki codes
* Some &lt;nowiki&gt;[[broken]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links are fixed
* Links to the talk page of that very article are removed
* Self links (like [[Wikipedia:PHP script automatic wikification|this]]) are removed
* Multiple links from that very article to the same page are removed; only the first of these links stays
* Plural &lt;nowiki&gt;[[link|links]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; are converted to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[link]]s&lt;/nowiki&gt; (I know some of you don't like this; I'll leave it in for now, can be taken out later)
* The page title is marked bold ''if'' it occurs in the first line ''and'' if there are no bold marks already in place in this line. So, a manually set ''bold'' title will prevent any change
* ''nowiki'' and ''pre'' tags, as well as their contents, stay untouched

All of this can be changed; it ''should'' be expanded. Please add functions to include ''within this feature'' below. The feature will go online with the next software update. --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]], Monday, April 8, 2002

called html2wikipedia.  You can download the tool from

[[File:Goldcertificate front.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. $50 gold certificate]]

'''Representative money''' is any [[medium of exchange]], often printed on paper, that represents something of [[Value (economics)|value]], but has little or no value of its own ([[Intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]]). Unlike some forms of [[fiat money]] (which may have no [[commodity]] backing), genuine representative money must have something of intrinsic value supporting the [[face value]].&lt;ref name=mundell/&gt;

More specifically, the term ''representative money'' has been used variously to mean:
* A claim on a commodity, for example [[gold certificate|gold]] and [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mundell&quot;&gt;Robert A. Mundell, [http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:114139/CONTENT/econ_0102_08.pdf The Birth of Coinage], Discussion Paper #:0102-08, Department of Economics, [[Columbia University]], February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Hooks, ''Economics:fundamentals for financial services providers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=wfbfki5YB0UC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=Money+representative&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=USQtydC41G&amp;sig=lKY0bdbYnY9T2_d82K-Dvd9bgXY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=D0OoSsrLHo7_nQfqnt2TBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=Money%20representative&amp;f=false p. 201] {{ISBN|0-89982-494-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-89982-494-9}} Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p.30&quot;&gt;William Howard Steiner, ''Money and banking'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=gq6CAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=representative+money#search_anchor p. 30], H. Holt and company, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense it may be called &quot;[[Monetary system#Commodity-backed money|commodity-backed money]]&quot;.
* Any type of [[money]] that has face value greater than its value as material substance.  Used in this sense, most types of [[fiat money]] are a type of representative money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Historically, the use of representative money predates the invention of [[coin]]age. In the ancient empires of Egypt, Babylon, India and China, the temples and palaces often had commodity warehouses which issued certificates of deposit as evidence of a claim upon a portion of the goods stored in the warehouses, a form of &quot;representative money&quot;.&lt;ref name=mundell/&gt;

According to economist [[William Stanley Jevons]] (1875), representative money in the form of [[bank notes]] arose because metal coins often were &quot;variously clipped or depreciated&quot; during use, but representative money could not have its face value thus divided.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Stanley Jevons]], ''Money and the Mechanism of Exchange'', Chapter XVI, &quot;Representative Money&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 economist [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] wrote that credit expansion and contraction was in fact the expansion and contraction of representative money.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Shield Nicholson]], ''A treatise on money and essays on monetary problems''], Chapter VI, Effects of Credit or &quot;Representative Money&quot; on prices, [https://archive.org/details/treatiseonmoney00nichiala/page/72 &lt;!-- quote=&quot;representative money&quot;. --&gt; pp. 72–74], A. and C. Black, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 economist William Howard Steiner wrote that the term was used &quot;at one time to signify that a certain amount of bullion was stored in the Treasury while the equivalent paper in circulation&quot; represented the bullion.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.30&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Writer Howard Spring.jpg|thumb|right|Howard Spring]]     
'''Howard Spring''' (10 February 1889 – 3 May 1965) was a Welsh author and journalist who wrote in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abfar.org.uk/ref/?Author_notes_and_lists:Howard_Spring |title=Biography and bibliography of Howard Spring – Howard Spring |work=abfar.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his writing career as a [[journalism|journalist]] but from 1934 produced a series of best-selling novels for adults and children. The most successful was ''[[Fame Is the Spur (novel)|Fame Is the Spur]]'' (1940), which was later adapted into [[Fame Is the Spur (film)|a film]] starring [[Michael Redgrave]] and, later still a [[Fame is the Spur (TV series)|BBC TV series]] (1982) starring [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] and [[David Hayman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2ba423457e |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722213210/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2ba423457e |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 July 2012 |title=Howard Spring |work=BFI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Howard Spring was born in [[Cardiff]], the son of a jobbing gardener. He was forced to leave school at the age of twelve, when his father died, to start work as an errand boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://reading19001950.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/the-autobiography-of-howard-spring-1972/ |title=The Autobiography of Howard Spring (1972) |work=Reading 1900-1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later became an office boy at a firm of chartered accountants in Cardiff Docks and then a messenger at the offices of the ''[[South Wales Daily News]]''. He was keen to train as a reporter, and spent his leisure time learning shorthand and taking evening classes at [[Cardiff University]], where he studied English, French, Latin, mathematics and history. He graduated to be a reporter on both the morning and evening editions of the ''South Wales Daily News''.

In 1911 he joined the ''Yorkshire Observer'' in [[Bradford]] before moving in 1915 to the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'', but was there only a few months before he was called up for the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Army Service Corps]] as a shorthand typist.

After the war, he returned to the ''Guardian'', where he worked as a reporter. [[C. P. Scott]], the editor, apparently regarded Spring's reporting skills highly; he wrote of Spring that: &quot;Nobody does a better 'descriptive' or a better condensation of a difficult address.&quot; Whilst working for the ''Guardian'', Spring lived in the suburb of [[Didsbury]]. In 1931, after reporting on a political meeting at which [[Lord Beaverbrook]] was the speaker, Beaverbrook was so impressed by Spring's piece (Spring described Beaverbrook as &quot;a pedlar of dreams&quot;, which took Beaverbrook's fancy) that he arranged for him to be offered a post with the ''Evening Standard'' in London as a book reviewer. Spring described the offer as &quot;irresistible&quot; and the appointment proved successful.

At the same time, Spring was developing his ambitions as a writer; his first book, ''Darkie and Co.'', a children's story, came out in 1932, followed by his first novel, ''[[Shabby Tiger]]'', which was set in Manchester, published by [[William Collins, Sons]] in 1934. ''Shabby Tiger'' was adapted as a [[Shabby Tiger (TV series)|television series of the same title]] produced by [[Granada Television]] in 1973. It starred [[John Nolan (British actor)|John Nolan]] as Nick and [[Prunella Gee]] as Anna, with [[Sharon Maughan]] making her TV debut as the glamorous and ambitious Rachel Rosing. A sequel to the novel followed a year later, ''[[Rachel Rosing]]'' (Collins, 1935). Both were published in the US in 1936.

The children's story ''Sampson's Circus'', illustrated by [[Steven Spurrier (artist)|Steven Spurrier]] and published by [[Faber &amp; Faber]] in 1936, was one of two commended runners up for the [[CILIP|Library Association]]'s inaugural [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]], recognising the year's outstanding contribution to children's literature by a British subject.&lt;ref name=ccsu&gt;

His first major success in the adult market came with ''[[My Son, My Son (novel)|My Son, My Son]]'' (1937), originally titled ''O Absalom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/561295/Howard-Spring |title=Howard Spring |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was successful in America and [[film adaptation|adapted]] there as the 1940 film ''[[My Son, My Son!]]''. It was adapted for television by the BBC in 1977. [[WorldCat]] libraries report editions in Chinese, German, Hebrew and four other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/my-son-my-son/oclc/296037/editions?cookie=&amp;start_edition=1&amp;sd=asc&amp;se=yr&amp;referer=di&amp;qt=show_more_ln%3A&amp;editionsView=true&amp;fq=&amp;fc=ln%3A_25 &quot;Formats and Editions of My son, my son&quot;. WorldCat. Retrieved 22 August 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 Spring moved to [[Mylor, Cornwall|Mylor]] in [[Cornwall]] (his wife Marion's father had a house at [[St Mawes]]) to become a full-time writer. In 1940, his best-known work, ''[[Fame Is the Spur (novel)|Fame Is the Spur]]'', the story of a Labour leader's rise to power, was published. During the war years Spring wrote two other novels, ''[[Hard Facts]]'' (1944) and ''Dunkerley's'' (1946).

In 1947 Spring and his wife moved to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], The White Cottage in Fenwick Road, and in the post-war period he published ''[[There Is No Armour]]'' (1948), ''[[The Houses in Between]]'' (1951), ''[[A Sunset Touch]]'' (1953), ''[[These Lovers Fled Away]]'' (1955), ''[[Time and the Hour]]'' (1957), ''[[All the Day Long]] '' (1959), ''[[I Met a Lady]]'' (1961), and his last book was ''[[Winds of the Day]]'' (1964). Spring also produced three volumes of autobiography: ''Heaven Lies About Us, A Fragment of Infancy'' (1939); ''In the Meantime'' (1942); and ''And Another Thing'' (1946), later published in one volume as ''The Autobiography of Howard Spring'' (Collins, 1972).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/autobiography-of-howard-spring/oclc/515254/editions?start_edition=1&amp;sd=asc&amp;referer=di&amp;se=yr&amp;qt=sort_yr_asc&amp;editionsView=true&amp;fq= &quot;Formats and Editions of The autobiography of Howard Spring&quot;]. WorldCat. Retrieved 22 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Spring served eight years as President of the prestigious [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]] and as a Director of the [[University College Falmouth|Falmouth School of Art]] and President of the Cornish Drama League. The last was well known for producing plays at the open-air [[Minack Theatre]] on the cliffs near Land's End.

Spring was a successful writer, who combined a wide understanding of human character with technical skill as a novelist. His method of composition was painstaking. Each morning he would shut himself in his room and write a thousand words, steadily building up to novels of around 150,000 words. He rarely made major alterations to his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/440079.Howard_Spring |title=Howard Spring |work=Goodreads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Spring died of a stroke. In 1967, his widow, Marion Spring, wrote an affectionate story of their life together, called ''Howard'', with a foreword by [[A. L. Rowse]]. It was published by Collins.

'''Khalil el-Moumni''' ({{lang-ar|خليل المومني}}; 1 July 1941 – 21 November 2020, [[Oujda]], Morocco) was a Moroccan [[imam]] who preached at the An-Nasr [[Mosque]] in [[Rotterdam]], the [[Netherlands]].  He was a center of controversy for his views on [[homosexuality]], which brought him into open conflict with the Dutch politician [[Pim Fortuyn]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Bni Mansour]]. In [[Morocco]] he was banned several times for speaking about &quot;injustice&quot; in society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Algemeen Dagblad]], [http://www.ad.nl/rotterdam/stad/article444856.ece ’Hier is echte vrijheid van meningsuiting’]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 2001, he appeared on the Dutch television program ''Nova'' to discuss the rising incidence of [[Anti-homosexualism|anti-homosexual]] violence by Moroccan youths. He said that &quot;if the sickness of homosexuality spreads itself, everyone can become infected&quot;.  &quot;That's what we are afraid of... Who will still make children if men marry among themselves and women too?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dutch language]]: &quot;[dat] als de ziekte van de homoseksualiteit zich verspreidt, iedereen besmet kan raken.&quot;  &quot;Daar zijn wij bang voor&quot; &quot;Wie maken nog kinderen als mannen onderling trouwen en vrouwen ook?&quot;, [http://www.novatv.nl/index.cfm?ln=nl&amp;fuseaction=artikelen.details&amp;achtergrond_id=39 NOVA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, various sources reported statements from sermons of his that were published in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in 1998.  He said: &quot;The western civilisation is a civilisation without morals. In the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands it is permitted for homosexuals to marry each other]]. The Europeans stand lower than dogs and pigs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trouw]], [http://archief.trouw.nl/artikel?REC=5c5c839cecd2e0960134690503418c79 Van Boxtel: Imam heeft gelogen], 15 juni 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty-nine individuals and organizations filed official complaints about his statements on the Nova program, under Dutch anti-discrimination laws.  However a drawn-out period of reconciliation followed, involving supporters of el-Moumni, Dutch politicians, homosexuals and religious groups, in which he was gradually moved to apologize.  He said that some of the Arabic statements were mistranslated.

In December 2001, the justice ministry decided to prosecute him anyway.  On 4 April 2002 a court in Rotterdam announced its verdict: although in principle his statements had been discriminatory against homosexuals, they were permitted on grounds of freedom of religious expression, since they were based on the [[Qur'an]] and other Muslim documents. The justice ministry appealed the decision but lost again on November 18, 2002.

Just before reaching the age of 65, el-Moumni ended his 46-year career with a last service in the An-Nasr [[Mosque]] on June 23, 2006. In this service el-Moumni called on believers to use the mosque not only for prayer, but also for civil activities.&lt;ref&gt;Interkerkelijke Omroep Nederland (IKON), [http://www.ikonrtv.nl/kerknieuws/nieuws.asp?lStrAction=&amp;oId=9137 Iman El-Moumni stopt met preken]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2020, el-Moumni died at the age of 79 from [[COVID-19]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ad.nl/rotterdam/bekende-imam-khalil-el-moumni-79-overleden-aan-corona~ad5879ef/ |title=Bekende imam Khalil el Moumni (79) overleden aan corona |website=ad.nl |language=Dutch |date=21 November 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rotterdamse imam El Moumni (79) overleden aan corona  |url=https://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/201376/Rotterdamse-imam-El-Moumni-79-overleden-aan-corona |website=Rijnmond |accessdate=22 November 2020 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

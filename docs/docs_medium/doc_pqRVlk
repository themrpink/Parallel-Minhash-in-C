In real-world scenarios, the assumption of a constant rate (or probability per unit time) is rarely satisfied. For example, the rate of incoming phone calls differs according to the time of day. But if we focus on a time interval during which the rate is roughly constant, such as from 2 to 4 p.m. during work days, the exponential distribution can be used as a good approximate model for the time until the next phone call arrives. Similar caveats apply to the following examples which yield approximately exponentially distributed variables:

* The time until a radioactive [[particle decay]]s, or the time between clicks of a [[Geiger counter]]
* The time it takes before your next telephone call
* The time until default (on payment to company debt holders) in reduced form credit risk modeling

Exponential variables can also be used to model situations where certain events occur with a constant probability per unit length, such as the distance between [[mutation]]s on a [[DNA]] strand, or between [[roadkill]]s on a given road.

In [[queuing theory]], the service times of agents in a system (e.g. how long it takes for a bank teller etc. to serve a customer) are often modeled as exponentially distributed variables.  (The arrival of customers for instance is also modeled by the [[Poisson distribution]] if the arrivals are independent and distributed identically.)  The length of a process that can be thought of as a sequence of several independent tasks follows the [[Erlang distribution]] (which is the distribution of the sum of several independent exponentially distributed variables).
[[Reliability theory]] and [[reliability engineering]] also make extensive use of the exponential distribution. Because of the ''[[#Memorylessness|memoryless]]'' property of this distribution, it is well-suited to model the constant [[hazard rate]] portion of the [[bathtub curve]] used in reliability theory. It is also very convenient because it is so easy to add [[failure rate]]s in a reliability model. The exponential distribution is however not appropriate to model the overall lifetime of organisms or technical devices, because the &quot;failure rates&quot; here are not constant: more failures occur for very young and for very old systems.

In [[physics]], if you observe a [[gas]] at a fixed [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] in a uniform [[gravitational field]], the heights of the various molecules also follow an approximate exponential distribution, known as the [[Barometric formula]]. This is a consequence of the entropy property mentioned below.

In [[hydrology]], the exponential distribution is used to analyze extreme values of such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritzema (ed.)|first=H.P.|title=Frequency and Regression Analysis|year=1994|publisher=Chapter 6 in: Drainage Principles and Applications, Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands|pages=[https://archive.org/details/drainageprincipl0000unse/page/175 175–224]|url=https://archive.org/details/drainageprincipl0000unse/page/175|isbn=90-70754-33-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the exponential distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% [[confidence belt]] based on the [[binomial distribution]]. The rainfall data are represented by [[plotting position]]s as part of the [[cumulative frequency analysis]].

===Prediction===
Having observed a sample of ''n'' data points from an unknown exponential distribution a common task is to use these samples to make predictions about future data from the same source. A common predictive distribution over future samples is the so-called plug-in distribution, formed by plugging a suitable estimate for the rate parameter ''λ'' into the exponential density function. A common choice of estimate is the one provided by the principle of maximum likelihood, and using this yields the predictive density over a future sample ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, conditioned on the observed samples ''x'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') given by

:&lt;math&gt;p_{\rm ML}(x_{n+1} \mid x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \left( \frac1{\overline{x}} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{x_{n+1}}{\overline{x}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The Bayesian approach provides a predictive distribution which takes into account the uncertainty of the estimated parameter, although this may depend crucially on the choice of prior.

A predictive distribution free of the issues of choosing priors that arise under the subjective Bayesian approach is

:&lt;math&gt;p_{\rm CNML}(x_{n+1} \mid x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \frac{ n^{n+1} \left( \overline{x} \right)^n }{ \left( n \overline{x} + x_{n+1} \right)^{n+1} },&lt;/math&gt;

which can be considered as
# a frequentist [[confidence distribution]], obtained from the distribution of the pivotal quantity &lt;math&gt;{x_{n+1}}/{\overline{x}}&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawless |first=J.

# an objective Bayesian predictive posterior distribution, obtained using the non-informative [[Jeffreys prior]] 1/''λ'';
# the Conditional Normalized Maximum Likelihood (CNML) predictive distribution, from information theoretic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Schmidt and E. Makalic, &quot;[http://www.emakalic.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/SchmidtMakalic09b.pdf Universal Models for the Exponential Distribution]&quot;, ''[[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]]'', Volume 55, Number 7, pp. 3087–3090, 2009 {{doi|10.1109/TIT.2009.2018331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accuracy of a predictive distribution may be measured using the distance or divergence between the true exponential distribution with rate parameter, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the predictive distribution based on the sample ''x''. The [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] is a commonly used, parameterisation free measure of the difference between two distributions. Letting Δ(''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;||''p'') denote the Kullback–Leibler divergence between an exponential with rate parameter ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a predictive distribution ''p'' it can be shown that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}_{\lambda_0} \left[ \Delta(\lambda_0\parallel p_{\rm ML}) \right] &amp;= \psi(n) + \frac{1}{n-1} - \log(n) \\
\operatorname{E}_{\lambda_0} \left[ \Delta(\lambda_0\parallel p_{\rm CNML}) \right] &amp;= \psi(n) + \frac{1}{n} - \log(n)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the expectation is taken with respect to the exponential distribution with rate parameter {{nowrap|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ (0, ∞)}}, and {{nowrap|ψ( · )}} is the digamma function. It is clear that the CNML predictive distribution is strictly superior to the maximum likelihood plug-in distribution in terms of average Kullback–Leibler divergence for all sample sizes {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 0}}.

==Computational methods==
===Generating exponential variates===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gamma distribution]] --&gt;
A conceptually very simple method for generating exponential [[random variate|variate]]s is based on [[inverse transform sampling method|inverse transform sampling]]: Given a random variate ''U'' drawn from the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] on the unit interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1), the variate

:&lt;math&gt;T = F^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt;

has an exponential distribution, where ''F''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[quantile function]], defined by

:&lt;math&gt;F^{-1}(p)=\frac{-\ln(1-p)}{\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if ''U'' is uniform on (0, 1), then so is 1 − ''U''.  This means one can generate exponential variates as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{-\ln(U)}{\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

Other methods for generating exponential variates are discussed by Knuth&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Knuth|Donald E. Knuth]] (1998).

'''''Beyond This Horizon''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. It was originally published as a two-part serial in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' (April, May 1942, under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald) and then as a single volume by [[Fantasy Press]] in 1948. It was awarded a [[Retro-Hugo]] award for best novel in 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugo43&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1943-retro-hugo-awards/ |title=1943 Retro-Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The novel depicts a world in which genetic selection for increased health, longevity, and intelligence has become so widespread that the unmodified &quot;[[control group|control naturals]]&quot; are a carefully-managed and protected minority. [[Duels]] and the carrying of arms are socially accepted ways of maintaining civility in public. A man can wear distinctive clothing to show his unwillingness to duel, but that results in an inferior social status. The world has become an economic [[utopia]]; the &quot;economic dividend&quot; is so high that [[post-scarcity|work has become optional]]. The chief economic problem uses up the economic surplus: many high-quality goods actually cost ''less'' than those of lower quality. Many people use lower-quality goods as status symbols. The government invests heavily in scientific research, but it has the side effect of further increasing productivity a decade or more later and so long-term projects with no expected economic return are favored above anything but medical research, on the theory that longer lifespans will consume more surplus.

The story's protagonist, Hamilton Felix (surname first), is the archetypal [[übermensch]]. He is the penultimate step in a &quot;star line&quot; designed to breed for the highest-quality human characteristics. However, he lacks [[eidetic memory]], which disqualifies him for what many consider to be humanity's most important occupation: that of an &quot;encyclopedic synthesist,&quot; who analyzes the sum total of human knowledge for untapped potential. As such, he finds his life and the society in which he lives to be enjoyable but meaningless. However, when one of the synthesists seeks him out and inquires when he plans to continue his line, he finds himself drawn into an adventure that gives him purpose and also convinces him that his society is worth saving after all.

Major themes in the novel are reincarnation, the immortality of the soul, and telepathy. Felix is the product of generations of [[genetic engineering]]. He is almost but not quite the perfect human. In the second half of the book, his genetically-engineered son is born, the climax of generations of genetic engineering and selective breeding and a genetically-perfect human. As the son grows, he begins to develop almost-superhuman mental abilities and a surprising telepathic ability.

As the novel draws to a close, it becomes apparent that the son senses that Hamiton Felix's second child, a daughter, is the reincarnation of a wise elderly government official, who foresaw her own death and arranged to die shortly before Felix's daughter was born. The official understood that the soul is reincarnated, and in preparation for her own death and reincarnation, she was instrumental in the genetic engineering of the son and the daughter.

==Reception==
[[Anthony Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas]] characterized ''Beyond This Horizon'' as among &quot;the finest science fiction novels of the modern crop.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Recommended Reading&quot;, ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', October 1951, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. Schuyler Miller]] reviewed the novel favorably, saying &quot;in true Heinlein manner the basic theme of the book smashes the screen of action only in the closing pages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Book Reviews&quot;, ''[[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]]'', February 1949, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the Japanese visual novel ''[[Eden*]]'', the term 'Felix' is used in the setting to refer to genetically engineered humans with abilities similar to those described in the book, and the connection to Heinlein's work is referred to in dialogue.

[[File:Two complete science adventure books 1952win n7.jpg|thumb|right|''Beyond This Horizon'' was reprinted in ''[[Two Complete Science-Adventure Books]]'' in 1952, appearing under the &quot;Anson McDonald&quot; byline even though the book edition had been published under Heinlein's own name four years earlier]]

'''''Rocket Ship Galileo''''' is a juvenile [[science fiction]] novel by  American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]], published in 1947, about three teenagers who participate in a pioneering flight to the Moon. It was the first in the [[Heinlein juveniles]], a long and successful series of science fiction novels published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]]. The novel was originally envisioned as the first of a series of books called &quot;Young Rocket Engineers&quot;. It was initially rejected by publishers, because going to the moon was &quot;too far out&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Heinlein, ''Expanded Universe'', foreword to &quot;Free Men&quot;, p. 207 of Ace paperback edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

After World War II, three teenage boy rocket experimenters are recruited by one boy's uncle, Dr. Cargraves, a renowned physicist who had worked on the [[Manhattan Project]], to refit a conventionally powered surplus &quot;[[Rocket mail|mail rocket]]&quot;. It is to be converted to run on a [[thorium]] nuclear pile which boils [[zinc]] as a propellant. They use a cleared area in a military weapons test range in the desert for their work, despite prying and sabotage attempts by unknown agents.

Upon completion of the modifications, they stock the rocket, which they name the ''Galileo'', and take off for the Moon, taking approximately three days to arrive. After establishing a semi-permanent structure based on a [[Quonset hut]], they claim the Moon on behalf of the United Nations.

As they set up a radio to communicate with the Earth they pick up a local transmission, the sender of which promises to meet them. Instead, their ship is bombed. However, they are able to hole up undetected in their hut and succeed in ambushing the other ship when it lands, capturing the pilot. They discover that there is a [[Space Nazis|Nazi base]] on the Moon. They bomb it from their captured ship and land. One survivor is found, revived, and questioned.

The boys also find evidence of an ancient lunar civilization, and postulate that the craters of the Moon were formed not by impacts from space, but by [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear]] bombs that destroyed the alien race.

When the base's [[Nazi]] leader shoots the pilot in order to silence him, Cargraves convenes a trial and finds him guilty of murder. Cargraves prepares to execute the prisoner by ejecting him into [[vacuum]], mostly as a bluff for information on how to fly the base's spaceship. The Nazi capitulates in the airlock and teaches them how to fly the ship back to Earth.

The boys radio the location of the hidden Nazi base on Earth to the authorities, leading to its destruction; they return as heroes.

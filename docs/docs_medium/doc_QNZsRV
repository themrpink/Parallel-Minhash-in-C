==Fishing==
{{Main|Bass fishing}}
Largemouth, smallmouth, and spotted bass are the most popular game fish in North America.

It is also very popular in South Africa. In the country, largemouth bass is often found in lakes, rivers, creeks, and dams.

When fishing, lures ([[Bass worms]]) or live bait will work. Lures that mimic baitfish, worms, crayfish, frogs, and mice are all effective.

'''''Micropterus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the sunfish [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Centrarchidae]]) of [[order (biology)|order]] [[Perciformes]].  The species of this genus are known as the '''black bass'''.

The black bass are sometimes erroneously called black trout, but the name [[trout]] more correctly refers to certain members of the [[Salmonidae|salmon]] family.

The black bass are distributed throughout a large area east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[North America]], from the [[Hudson Bay]] basin in [[Canada]] to northeastern [[Mexico]]. Several species, notably the [[largemouth bass|largemouth]] and [[smallmouth bass]]es, have been very widely introduced throughout the world, and are now considered [[cosmopolitan (species)|cosmopolitan]]. Black bass of all species are highly sought-after [[game fish]], and [[bass fishing]] is an extremely popular sport throughout the bass's native range.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  These fish are well known as strong fighters, and their meat is eaten, being quite edible and firm.

All ''Micropterus'' species have a dull-green base coloring with dark patterns on the sides.  Most reach a maximum overall length of 40&amp;ndash;60&amp;nbsp;cm (16&amp;ndash;24&amp;nbsp;in), but some strains of the [[largemouth bass]] have been reported to grow to almost a full meter (just over three feet) in length.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, F.C., Arndt, R.G., Lindquist, D.G. &amp; Parnell, J.F. (1996): ''Freshwater Fishes of the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware.'' Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1994.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The male builds a &quot;bed&quot; (nest) in which a female is induced to deposit her eggs, then he fertilizes them. The male continues to guard the eggs and fry until they disperse from the nest.

Various species have been introduced into freshwater bodies in Japan, where they have been declared nuisance fish, and subjected to numerous attempts at eradicating them from local ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200707060125.html | date=6 July 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134201/http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200707060125.html | archivedate=29 September 2007| title=Locals in for long haul in battle against non-native fish| newspaper=Asahi Shimbun| access-date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''spotted bass''' (''Micropterus punctulatus''), also called '''spotty''', &lt;!--'''''&quot;Leeman&quot;''''',--&gt; or '''spots''' in various fishing communities, is a [[species]] of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] of the sunfish [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Centrarchidae]]) of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Perciformes]].  One of the [[black bass]]es, it is native to the [[Mississippi River]] basin and across the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] states, from central [[Texas]] through the [[Florida]] panhandle.  Its native range extends into the western [[Mid-Atlantic states]] and it has been introduced into western [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]].  
It has also been introduced to southern [[Africa]], where it has become established in some isolated waters. It is often mistaken for the similar and more common [[largemouth bass]].

A convenient way to distinguish between a largemouth bass and a spotted bass is by the size of the mouth. A spotted bass will resemble a largemouth bass in coloration but will have a smaller mouth.

''M. punctulatus'' can reach an overall length of almost {{convert|64|cm|in|abbr=on}}, reaching weights of up to {{convert|5.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.  It can reach an age of at least seven years. It is noted for the rows of dark spots below the lateral line, which give it its common name.

Preferring cool and warm mountain streams and reservoirs with rocky bottoms, the spotted bass feeds on [[insect]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[frog]]s, [[annelid]] worms, and smaller fish.

In 2010, the scientific community officially recognized a separate subspecies of spotted bass, native to the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and [[Coosa River]]s, and their lakes. This species is commonly known as the &quot;Alabama spotted bass&quot; (''M. henshalli'') and known locally as the &quot;Coosa spotted bass&quot;, not to be confused with the &quot;red-eye Coosa bass&quot; found in northeast Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614232601/http://www.biggeorgiaspots.com/the-fishes/about-spots/168-nomenclature-of-the-spotted-bass.html |title = Nomenclature of the Spotted Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alabama spotted is highly prized as a gamefish and average size is much larger than the more common Kentucky spotted bass. The current record spotted bass, caught in pine Flat Lake, California, weighed 10.27&amp;nbsp;lb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614230852/http://www.biggeorgiaspots.com/the-fishes/about-spots/164-state-records-for-spotted-bass.html | title=State Records for Spotted Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Typical Tallapoosa River Spotted Bass.jpg|right|thumb|Typical spotted bass from [[Tallapoosa River]] near [[Tallassee, Alabama]] (released)]]
Many anglers who catch a spotted bass mistake it for a largemouth due to the coloration although there are subtle differences. The spotted bass, like all black basses except the largemouth, has scales on the base portion of the second dorsal fin, its first and second dorsal fin are clearly connected, and its upper jaw bone does not extend back to or beyond the rear edge of the eyes. The spotted bass is also often confused with a smallmouth bass or smally for short, but it lacks the vertical bars that are present on the sides of the body of a smallmouth bass. The spotted bass also has small black spots below the lateral line unlike either the large or smallmouth bass. Juveniles often resemble the young of smallmouth bass in having a broad band of orange at the base of the tail, followed by a broad black band and white edge. The spotted bass is known to hybridize with the smallmouth, which sometimes makes identification difficult. Spotted bass can be found deeper than smallmouth bass at depths up to 100&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.igfa.org/species/90-bass-spotted.aspx?CommonName=90-bass-spotted.aspx |title=Bass, spotted |website=Igfa.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
Spotted bass seem to segregated by habitat type from closely related species such as the large and small mouth bass. They tend to be found in areas with more current than the largemouth, and usually inhabit areas that are too warm, turbid, and sluggish for smallmouth bass. They usually occur around aquatic vegetation, submerged logs, and rock or riprap walls in small to large flowing streams, rivers, and reservoirs. Spotted bass are distributed throughout the Ohio river basin as well as the central and lower Mississippi river basin. The species may be found in Gulf Coast states from Texas east to Florida. Spotted bass are native to portions of East Texas, particularly in the Sabine, Neches, and Cypress Rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/spb/|title=Spotted Bass (Micropterus punctulatus)|website=Tpwd.texas.gov|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
Spotted bass usually feed on small fishes, crayfishes, and aquatic insects.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outdooralabama.com/spotted-bass|title=Spotted Bass|date=2014-07-16|website=Outdoor Alabama|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young begin with copepods and other small crustaceans and soon begin to eat insects. The spotted bass's diet falls in between the largemouth and small mouth bass. It isn't nearly as predatory as the large mouth and only consumes about half the amount of the fish. Like all bass the Spotted bass feeds using suction by opening its mouth and creating a negative pressure that sucks in the prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fish-identification.com/ffdetails.asp?fish=spottedkentuckybass|title=Spotted (Kentucky) Bass Freshwater Fish Information|website=Fish-identification.com|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction and life cycle==
The spotted bass can live approximately six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nature.mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/spotted-bass|title=Spotted Bass {{!}} MDC Discover Nature|website=Nature.mdc.mo.gov|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spawning occurs from April to May in habitat similar to that used by smallmouth. The males builds the nest in gravel or other substrate then entices a female to deposit her eggs. The males guard the eggs until they disperse. Several spotted and smallmouth bass hybrids have been collected recently in area reservoirs suggesting there is occasionally competition between the two species for spawning habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnfish.org/SpeciesFishInformation_TWRA/SpottedBassTennessee_MicropterusPunctulatus_TWRA.htm|title=TWRA - Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency - Spotted Bass|website=Tnfish.org|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance to humans==
The spotted bass is a game fish that is fished for regularly. In this context Spotted bass is a good food source for humans.

==Invasive species==
The spotted bass was introduced to the Thee River, Olifants‐Doring River system, Western Cape Province, South Africa as game fish before 2007 and rated as [[List_of_invasive_species_in_South_Africa#Fish|invasive species]]. The population was successfully eradicated in 2014. Gill and hand nets were used to remove the majority of the stock, while individuals were caught by [[speargun|spearguns]], [[seine net|seine nets]] and [[electrofishing|back‐pack electrofishing]]. The spotted bass was held responsible for a decline in abundance of native [[fiery redfin]] (''Pseudobarbus phlegethon'' (Barnard, 1938)) and [[Cape galaxias]] (''Galaxias zebratus'' Castelnau, 1861). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Successful mechanical eradication of spotted bass (Micropterus punctulatus (Rafinesque, 1819)) from a South African river|journal = Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|volume = 29|issue = 2|pages = 303–311|doi = 10.1002/aqc.3035|year = 2019|last1 = Walt|first1 = Johannes A.|last2 = Marr|first2 = Sean M.|last3 = Wheeler|first3 = Marius J.|last4 = Impson|first4 = N.

{{Refimprove|date=February 2009}}
An '''object''' is a [[philosophy]] term often used in contrast to the term ''[[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]''. A subject is an observer and an object is a thing observed. For modern philosophers like [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[consciousness]] is a state of [[cognition]] that includes the subject—which can never be doubted as only it can be the one who doubts—and some object(s) that may be considered as not having [[reality|real]] or full existence or value independent of the subject who observes it. [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] frameworks also differ in whether they consider objects existing independently of their [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] and, if so, in what way.&lt;ref name=&quot;goswick&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goswick |first1=Dana |title=Ordinary Objects |url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0312.xml |website=oxfordbibliographies |accessdate=20 April 2020 |language=en |doi=10.1093/obo/9780195396577-0312 |date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] defines the broad notion of an object as anything that we can think or talk about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/object.html|title=Object|last=Peirce|first=Charles S.|publisher=[[University of Helsinki]]|accessdate=2009-03-19|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214004523/http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/object.html|archivedate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a general sense it is any [[wikt:entity|entity]]: the [[pyramids]], [[Alpha Centauri]], the number [[7|seven]], a disbelief in [[predestination]] or the [[fear of cats]]. In a strict sense it refers to any definite [[being]].

A related notion is '''objecthood'''. Objecthood is the state of being an object. One approach to defining it is in terms of objects' properties and [[Relations (philosophy)|relations]]. Descriptions of all bodies, minds, and persons must be in terms of their properties and relations. The philosophical question of the nature of objecthood concerns how objects are related to their properties and relations. For example, it seems that the only way to describe an apple is by describing its properties and how it is related to other things. Its properties may include its redness, its size, and its composition, while its relations may include &quot;on the table&quot;, &quot;in the room&quot; and &quot;being bigger than other apples&quot;.

The notion of an object must address two problems: the change problems and the problems of substances. Two leading theories about objecthood are [[substance theory]], wherein substances (objects) are distinct from their properties, and [[bundle theory]], wherein objects are no more than bundles of their properties.

==Etymology==
In English the word ''object'' is derived from the [[Latin]] O''bjectus'' (p.p. of ''Obicere'') with the meaning &quot;to throw, or put before or against&quot;, from ''ob''- and ''jacere'', &quot;to throw&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ernest (1969) ''A comprehensive etymological dictionary of the English language'', Vol II, Elsevier publishing company, Amsterdam, pp. 1066–1067&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is a root for several important words used to derive meaning, such as objectify (to materialize), objective (a future [[reference]]), and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivism]] (a philosophical doctrine that knowledge is based on objective reality).

==Change==
An attribute of an object is called a property if it can be experienced (e.g. its color, size, weight, smell, taste, and location). Objects manifest themselves through their properties. These manifestations seem to change in a regular and unified way, suggesting that something underlies the properties. The change problem asks what that underlying thing is. According to [[substance theory]], the answer is a substance, that which stands for the change.

==Problem of substance==
{{main|Substance theory}}
Because substances are only experienced through their properties a substance itself is never directly experienced. The problem of substance asks on what basis can one conclude the existence of a substance that cannot be seen or scientifically verified. According to [[David Hume]]'s [[bundle theory]], the answer is none; thus an object is merely its properties.

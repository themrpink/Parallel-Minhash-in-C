In the novels published by [[Pocket Books]] and set after ''Nemesis'', Data returned in 2384 by having his memories and neural net transferred from B-4 into a new body which contained the memory engrams of Data's creator Doctor Noonien Soong after he was dying and being attacked by Lore years earlier. Data then takes control of the body after Soong deletes himself. After a tearful reunion with his old shipmates, Picard offers to reactivate Data's commission and to rejoin the crew but Data declines as he says he requires time. Several months later, with the help of the ''Enterprise'' crew, he is able to obtain the help necessary to resurrect his daughter, Lal.

The novel ''The Buried Age'', set between the destruction of the USS ''Stargazer'' and Picard being appointed captain of the ''Enterprise''-D, depicts Data's first meeting with Picard, during a mission where the two also work with then-Lieutenant [[Kathryn Janeway]], which depicts Picard encouraging Data, who has prior to this been stuck in relatively menial roles because he was uncertain how to express ambition, to push himself and specifically request assignments. This advice leads to Data receiving a promotion and commendation when he uncovers a plan to sabotage the design of the still-in-development ''Galaxy''-class ships, with the admiral overseeing Data's promotion assuring Data that there will be a place for him on a ''Galaxy''-class ship when they are completed.

In the prologue to the novel adaptation for ''[[Encounter at Farpoint]]'' by [[David Gerrold]], Data chose his own name, due to his love for, and identification with, knowledge.

Data also appeared in the crossover graphic novel series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2]]'', set in 2368, in which the [[Borg Collective]] joins forces with the [[Cybermen]] when the latter invade their universe. Data and the crew of the ''Enterprise''-D form an alliance of their own with the [[Eleventh Doctor]]—who immediately recognizes Data as an android upon seeing him—and his companions, [[Amy Pond]] and [[Rory Williams]]. The group later forms a reluctant truce with the Borg, who have been betrayed by the Cybermen and are in danger of falling to them. Data and the others manage to restore the Borg Collective and destroy the Cybermen, but their Borg liaison then attempts to seize control of the Doctor's [[TARDIS]]. The time machine's intelligence then briefly transfers itself into Data to escape the Borg's control, and the empowered Data overpowers the Borg and throws him out into the Time Vortex before the TARDIS returns to its usual form.

==Spot==
'''Spot''' is Data's [[pet]] [[cat]] and a recurring character in the show.  Spot appears in several episodes during ''TNG''{{'}}s last four seasons, as well as in the feature films ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''. She first appears in the episode &quot;[[Data's Day]]&quot;.

Despite her name, Spot is not actually patterned with spots. Spot originally appears as a male [[Somali (cat)|Somali cat]], but later appears as a female orange [[tabby cat]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia |last=Okuda |first=Michael |last2=Okuda, Denise |publisher=Pocket Books |others=Debbie Mirek |year=1994 |isbn=0-671-53609-5 |page=460 |chapter=S |author-link=Michael Okuda |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/startrekencyclop00okud_0 |chapter-url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually giving birth to [[kitten]]s (''TNG'': &quot;[[Genesis (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Genesis]]&quot;).

Data creates several hundred food supplement variations for Spot and composes the poem &quot;Ode to Spot&quot; in the cat's honor (&quot;[[Schisms (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Schisms]]&quot;). A computer error which occurs later in the series (in the episode &quot;[[A Fistful of Datas]]&quot;) causes some of the ship's food replicators to create only Spot's supplements and replaces portions of a play with the ode's text.

In &quot;[[Genesis (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Genesis]]&quot;, the morphogenetic virus &quot;Barclay's protomorphosis disease&quot; temporarily mutates Spot into an [[iguana]]-like [[reptile]].&lt;ref name=&quot;startrek.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/TNG/episode/68648.html |title=Star Trek: The Next Generation: Genesis (1994) |publisher=StarTrek.com |access-date=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spot's kittens are not affected, leading to the discovery of the mechanism and a cure for the virus.

Spot is notoriously unfriendly to most people other than Data. [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|Commander]] [[William Riker]] once received serious scratches while trying to feed Spot (&quot;[[Timescape (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Timescape]]&quot;). [[Geordi La Forge]] borrowed her to experience taking care of a cat, but she knocked over a vase and teapot and damaged his furniture (&quot;[[Force of Nature (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Force of Nature]]&quot;). When Data asked [[Worf]] to take care of Spot, Worf proved to be [[allergy|allergic]] to her and sneezed in her face, angering her (&quot;[[Phantasms (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Phantasms]]&quot;). However, she did get along with [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|Lieutenant]] [[Reginald Barclay]], so when Data had to leave on a mission at the same time Spot's kittens were due, he persuaded Barclay to take care of her (&quot;[[Genesis (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Genesis]]&quot;).

[[The Beat Fleet]], a [[Croatia]]n [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] band, wrote a song called &quot;Data&quot; for their album ''[[Galerija Tutnplok]]'' dedicated to Data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhunity.org/tekstovi/recenzije/tbf-galerija-tutnplok.html Hip Hop Unity: TBF {{ndash}} Galerija Tutnplok.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025160253/http://www.hhunity.org/tekstovi/recenzije/tbf-galerija-tutnplok.html |date=October 25, 2008 }} Fetched on February 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The release of this album coincided with reruns of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' being shown on [[Croatian Radiotelevision]]. Cuban-American musician [[Aurelio Voltaire]] has also performed a song about Data entitled &quot;The Sexy Data Tango&quot; on his EP ''Banned on Vulcan'' and later his album ''[[BiTrektual]]''.

Spiner himself released an album of old pop standards from the 1930s and '40s entitled ''[[Ol' Yellow Eyes Is Back]]'', a reference to the contact lenses he wore as Data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/cast-every-star-trek-series-happened-next/brent-spiner/ |title=Star Trek before Discovery: what did the cast do next? |date=September 25, 2017 |via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

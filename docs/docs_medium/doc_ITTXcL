Each of these has an important role in reducing variability in intercommunication software and enhancing a common understanding of the end goal to be achieved.

===Market dominance and power ===
Interoperability tends to be regarded as an issue for experts and its implications for daily living are sometimes underrated. The [[European Union Microsoft competition case]] shows how interoperability concerns important questions of power relationships. In 2004, the European Commission found that Microsoft had abused its market power by deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows work group servers and non-Microsoft work group servers. By doing so, Microsoft was able to protect its dominant market position for work group server operating systems, the heart of corporate IT networks. Microsoft was ordered to disclose complete and accurate interface documentation, which will enable rival vendors to compete on an equal footing (“the interoperability remedy”). As of June 2005, the Commission is market testing a new proposal by Microsoft to do this, having rejected previous proposals as insufficient.

Interoperability has also surfaced in the [[software patent debate]] in the [[European Parliament]] (June–July 2005). Critics claim that because patents on techniques required for interoperability are kept under RAND (reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing) conditions, customers will have to pay license fees twice: once for the product and, in the appropriate case, once for the patent-protected program the product uses.

===Medical industry===
New technology is being introduced in [[hospitals]] and labs at an ever-increasing rate. The need for “[[plug-and-play]]” interoperability&amp;nbsp;– the ability to take a medical device out of its box and easily make it work with one's other devices&amp;nbsp;– has attracted great attention from both healthcare providers and industry.

Increasingly, medical devices like incubators, imaging (MRI, CT, ultrasound, and others) are driven by sophisticated software that must integrate at the point of care and with electronic systems, such as electronic medical records. At the 2016 Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS) meeting, experts in the field like Angela N. Johnson with GE Healthcare and representative of the United States Food and Drug Administration provided practical seminars in how companies developing new medical devices, and hospitals installing them, can work more effectively to align interoperable software systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assurx.com/raps-preview-fda-cdrh-director-shuren-talks-priorities/ |title= RAPS Preview: FDA CDRH Director Shuren Talks Priorities |date= September 19, 2016 |access-date= April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Railways ===
{{anchor| Railways}}

Railways have greater or lesser interoperability depending on conforming to standards of [[Track gauge|gauge]], [[Railway coupling|couplings]], [[brake (railway)|brakes]], [[Railway signal|signalling]], [[communications]], [[loading gauge]], [[structure gauge]], and [[Railway signalling#Operating rules|operating rules]], to mention a few parameters. For passenger rail service, different [[railway platform height]] and [[platform gap|width clearance]] standards may also cause interoperability problems.

North American freight and intercity passenger railroads are highly interoperable, but systems in Europe, Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia are much less so. The parameter most difficult to overcome (at reasonable cost) is incompatibility of gauge, though [[variable gauge]] axle systems are increasingly used.

=== Telecommunications ===
In [[telecommunication]], the term can be defined as:

#The ability to provide services to and accept services from other systems, and to use the services exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together. [[ITU-T]] provides standards for international telecommunications. 
#The condition achieved among [[communications-electronics]] systems or items of communications-electronics equipment when [[information]] or services can be exchanged directly and satisfactorily between them and/or their users. The degree of interoperability should be defined when referring to specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DODDIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[two-way radio]], interoperability is composed of three dimensions:

* compatible communications paths (compatible frequencies, equipment and signaling),
* radio system coverage or adequate signal strength, and;
* scalable capacity.

==Organizations dedicated to interoperability==
Many organizations are dedicated to interoperability. All have in common that they want to push the development of the World Wide Web towards the semantic web.{{dubious|date=March 2014}} Some concentrate on eGovernment, eBusiness or data exchange in general. Internationally, [[Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium]] facilitates global interoperability across borders, language and technical barriers. In Europe, for instance, the European Commission and its [[IDABC]] program issue the [[European Interoperability Framework]]. IDABC was succeeded by the [[eGovernment in Europe#Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA)|ISA]] program. They also initiated the [[Semantic Interoperability Centre Europe]] (SEMIC.EU). A [https://web.archive.org/web/20080331053219/http://www.eulis.org/index.html European Land Information Service] (EULIS) was established in 2006, as a consortium of European National Land Registers. The aim of the service is to establish a single portal through which customers are provided with access to information about individual properties, about land and property registration services, and about the associated legal environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eulis.org/aims.html|title=Welcome - EULIS|first=Erskine|last=Design|access-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917042036/http://eulis.org/aims.html|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the government's CORE.gov service provides a collaboration environment for component development, sharing, registration, and reuse and related to this is the [http://www.NIEM.gov National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)] work and component repository. The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] serves as an agency for measurement standards.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2015}}
In [[telecommunication]], '''intersymbol interference''' ('''ISI''') is a form of [[distortion]] of a [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] in which one [[symbol (data)|symbol]] interferes with subsequent symbols. This is an unwanted phenomenon as the previous symbols have similar effect as [[electronic noise|noise]], thus making the communication less reliable. The spreading of the pulse beyond its allotted time interval causes it to interfere with neighboring pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lathi|first1=B.P.|last2=Ding|first2=Zhi|title=Modern Digital and Analog Communication Systems|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|isbn=9780195331455|page=394|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISI is usually caused by multipath propagation or the inherent linear or non-linear frequency response of a [[communication channel]] causing successive symbols to &quot;blur&quot; together.

The presence of ISI in the system introduces errors in the decision device at the receiver output. Therefore, in the design of the transmitting and receiving filters, the objective is to minimize the effects of ISI, and thereby deliver the digital data to its destination with the smallest error rate possible.

Ways to alleviate intersymbol interference include [[adaptive equalization]] and [[Error detection and correction|error correcting codes]].&lt;ref&gt;Digital Communications by Simon Haykin, McMaster University&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Multipath propagation ===
{{Main|Multipath propagation}}
One of the causes of intersymbol interference is [[multipath propagation]] in which a wireless signal from a transmitter reaches the receiver via multiple paths. The causes of this include [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] (for instance, the signal may bounce off buildings), [[refraction]] (such as through the [[leaf|foliage]] of a tree) and atmospheric effects such as [[atmospheric ducting]] and [[ionospheric reflection]]. Since the various paths can be of different lengths, this results in the different versions of the signal arriving at the receiver at different times. These delays mean that part or all of a given symbol will be spread into the subsequent symbols, thereby interfering with the correct detection of those symbols. Additionally, the various paths often distort the [[amplitude]] and/or [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the signal, thereby causing further interference with the received signal.

=== Bandlimited channels ===

Another cause of intersymbol interference is the transmission of a signal through a [[bandlimited]] channel, i.e., one where the [[frequency response]] is zero above a certain frequency (the cutoff frequency). Passing a signal through such a channel results in the removal of frequency components above this cutoff frequency. In addition, components of the frequency below the cutoff frequency may also be attenuated by the channel.

This [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] of the transmitted signal affects the shape of the pulse that arrives at the receiver. The effects of filtering a rectangular pulse not only change the shape of the pulse within the first symbol period, but it is also spread out over the subsequent symbol periods. When a message is transmitted through such a channel, the spread pulse of each individual symbol will interfere with following symbols.

Bandlimited channels are present in both wired and wireless communications. The limitation is often imposed by the desire to operate multiple independent signals through the same area/cable; due to this, each system is typically allocated a piece of the total [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] available. For wireless systems, they may be allocated a slice of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to transmit in (for example, [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] is often broadcast in the 87.5–108&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] range). This allocation is usually administered by a [[government agency]]; in the case of the United States this is the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). In a wired system, such as an [[optical fiber cable]], the allocation will be decided by the owner of the cable.

The bandlimiting can also be due to the physical properties of the medium - for instance, the cable being used in a wired system may have a cutoff frequency above which practically none of the transmitted signal will propagate.

Communication systems that transmit data over bandlimited channels usually implement [[pulse shaping]] to avoid interference caused by the bandwidth limitation. If the channel frequency response is flat and the shaping filter has a finite bandwidth, it is possible to communicate with no ISI at all. Often the channel response is not known beforehand, and an [[adaptive equalizer]] is used to compensate the frequency response.

== Effects on eye patterns ==
{{details|topic=eye patterns|Eye pattern}}

One way to study ISI in a [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] or data transmission system experimentally is to apply the received wave to the vertical deflection plates of an oscilloscope and to apply a sawtooth wave at the transmitted symbol rate R (R = 1/T) to the horizontal deflection plates. The resulting display is called an eye pattern because of its resemblance to the human eye for binary waves. The interior region of the eye pattern is called the eye opening. An eye pattern provides a great deal of information about the performance of the pertinent system.
# The width of the eye opening defines the time interval over which the received wave can be sampled without error from ISI. It is apparent that the preferred time for sampling is the instant of time at which the eye is open widest.
# The sensitivity of the system to timing error is determined by the rate of closure of the eye as the sampling time is varied.
# The height of the eye opening, at a specified sampling time, defines the margin over noise.

An eye pattern, which overlays many samples of a signal, can give a graphical representation of the
signal characteristics. The first image below is the eye pattern for a binary [[phase-shift keying]] (PSK) system in which a one is represented by an amplitude of −1 and a zero by an amplitude of +1. The current sampling time is at the center of the image and the previous and next sampling times are at the edges of the image. The various transitions from one sampling time to another (such as one-to-zero, one-to-one and so forth) can clearly be seen on the diagram.

The [[noise margin]] - the amount of noise required to cause the receiver to get an error - is given by the distance between the signal and the zero amplitude point at the sampling time; in other words, the further from zero at the sampling time the signal is the better. For the signal to be correctly interpreted, it must be sampled somewhere between the two points where the zero-to-one and one-to-zero transitions cross. Again, the further apart these points are the better, as this means the signal will be less sensitive to errors in the timing of the samples at the receiver.

The effects of ISI are shown in the second image which is an eye pattern of the same system when operating over a multipath channel. The effects of receiving delayed and distorted versions of the signal can be seen in the loss of definition of the signal transitions. It also reduces both the noise margin and the window in which the signal can be sampled, which shows that the performance of the system will be worse (i.e. it will have a greater [[bit error ratio]]).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Countering ISI ==

There are several techniques in [[telecommunication]] and data storage that try to work around the problem of intersymbol interference.

* Design systems such that the impulse response is short enough that very little energy from one symbol smears into the next symbol.
[[File:Raised-cosine-ISI.svg|thumb|500px|Consecutive raised-cosine impulses, demonstrating zero-ISI property]]
* Separate symbols in time with [[guard period]]s.
* Apply an [[Equalizer (communications)|equalizer]] at the receiver, that, broadly speaking, attempts to undo the effect of the channel by applying an inverse filter.
* Apply a [[Maximum likelihood sequence estimation|sequence detector]] at the receiver, that attempts to estimate the sequence of transmitted symbols using the [[Viterbi algorithm]].

== Intentional intersymbol interference ==
Coded modulation systems also exist that intentionally build a controlled amount of ISI into the system at the transmitter side, known as [[faster-than-Nyquist signaling]]. Such a design trades a computational complexity penalty at the receiver against a Shannon capacity gain of the overall transceiver system. See &lt;ref&gt;Faster than Nyquist Signaling, by J.B. Anderson, F. Rusek, and V. Owall, Proceedings of the IEEE, Aug. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; for a recent survey of this technique.

[[Image:Inverse square law.svg|thumb|420px|S represents the light source, while r represents the measured points. The lines represent the [[flux]] emanating from the sources and fluxes.
 
The total number of [[flux line]]s depends on the strength of the light source and is constant with increasing distance, where a greater density of flux lines (lines per unit area) means a stronger energy field. The density of flux lines is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source because the surface area of a sphere increases with the square of the radius. Thus the field intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.]]

In [[science]], an '''inverse-square law''' is any [[scientific law]] stating that a specified physical [[quantity]] is [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[distance]] from the source of that physical quantity. The fundamental cause for this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space.

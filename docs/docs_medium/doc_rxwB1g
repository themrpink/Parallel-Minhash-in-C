==Historical development==

Articles often develop by specialization of [[adjectives]] or [[determiners]]. Their development is often a sign of languages becoming more [[Analytic_language|analytic]] instead of [[synthetic_language|synthetic]], perhaps combined with the loss of [[inflection]] as in English, Romance languages, Bulgarian, Macedonian and Torlakian.

[[Joseph Greenberg]] in
Universals of Human Language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=maft03b0cqUC|title=Genetic Linguistics:Essays on Theory and Method|isbn=9780199257713|last1=Greenberg|first1=Joseph|date=2005-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
describes &quot;the cycle of the definite article&quot;: Definite articles (Stage I) evolve from demonstratives, and in turn can become generic articles (Stage II) that may be used in both definite and indefinite contexts, and later merely noun markers (Stage III) that are part of nouns other than proper names and more recent borrowings. Eventually articles may evolve anew from demonstratives.

=== Definite articles ===

Definite articles typically arise from [[demonstrative]]s meaning ''that''. For example, the definite articles in most [[Romance languages]]—e.g., ''el'', ''il'', ''le'', ''la'', ''lo'' — derive from the [[Latin]] demonstratives ''ille'' (masculine), ''illa'' (feminine) and ''illud'' (neuter).

The [[English language|English]] definite article ''[[English articles|the]]'', written ''þe'' in [[Middle English]], derives from an [[Old English language|Old English]] demonstrative, which, according to [[grammatical gender|gender]], was written ''se'' (masculine), ''seo'' (feminine) (''þe'' and ''þeo'' in the Northumbrian dialect), or [[That (disambiguation)|''þæt'']] (neuter). The neuter form ''þæt'' also gave rise to the modern demonstrative ''that''. The ''ye'' occasionally seen in pseudo-archaic usage such as &quot;[[Ye Olde]] Englishe Tea Shoppe&quot; is actually a form of ''þe'', where the letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] (''þ'') came to be written as a ''y''.

Multiple demonstratives can give rise to multiple definite articles. [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], for example, in which the articles are suffixed, has ''столот'' (''stolot''), the chair; ''столов'' (''stolov''), this chair; and ''столон'' (''stolon''), that chair. These derive from the [[Proto-Slavic]] demonstratives ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/tъ|*tъ]]'' &quot;this, that&quot;, ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/ovъ|*ovъ]]'' &quot;this here&quot; and ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/onъ|*onъ]]'' &quot;that over there, yonder&quot; respectively. [[Colognian language|Colognian]] prepositions articles such as in ''dat Auto'', or ''et Auto'', the car; the first being specifically selected, focused, newly introduced, while the latter is not selected, unfocused, already known, general, or generic.

Standard [[Basque language|Basque]] distinguishes between proximal and distal definite articles in the plural (dialectally, a proximal singular and an additional medial grade may also be present). The Basque distal form (with infix ''-a-'', etymologically a suffixed and phonetically reduced form of the distal demonstrative ''har-/hai-'') functions as the default definite article, whereas the proximal form (with infix ''-o-'', derived from the proximal demonstrative ''hau-/hon-'') is [[markedness#Marked and unmarked word pairs|marked]] and indicates some kind of (spatial or otherwise) close relationship between the speaker and the referent (e.g., it may imply that the speaker is included in the referent): ''etxeak'' (&quot;the houses&quot;) vs. ''etxeok'' (&quot;these houses [of ours]&quot;), ''euskaldunak'' (&quot;the Basque speakers&quot;) vs. ''euskaldunok'' (&quot;we, the Basque speakers&quot;).

Speakers of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], a [[modern Aramaic language]] that lacks a definite article, may at times use demonstratives  ''aha'' and ''aya'' (feminine) or ''awa'' (masculine) – which translate to &quot;this&quot; and &quot;[[that]]&quot;, respectively – to give the sense of &quot;the&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Zomaya S. (1997). ''Functional and other exotic sentences in Assyrian Aramaic'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, XI/2:44-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indefinite articles ===

Indefinite articles typically arise from adjectives meaning ''one''. For example, the indefinite articles in the [[Romance languages]]—e.g., ''un'', ''una'', ''une''—derive from the [[Latin]] adjective ''unus''. Partitive articles, however, derive from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''de illo'', meaning ''(some) of the''.

The [[English language|English]] indefinite article ''[[English articles|an]]'' is derived from the same root as ''one''. The ''-n'' came to be dropped before consonants, giving rise to the shortened form ''a''. The existence of both forms has led to many cases of [[juncture loss]], for example transforming the original ''a napron'' into the modern ''an apron''.

The [[Persian language|Persian]] indefinite article is ''yek'',  meaning one.

'''Allan J. Pinkerton''' (25 August 1819 – 1 July 1884) was a Scottish–American [[detective]] and [[espionage|spy]], best known for creating the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]].

==Early life, career and immigration==
Allan Pinkerton was born in [[Gorbals]], [[Glasgow]], Scotland, to William Pinkerton and his wife, Isobel McQueen, on August 25, 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461110/Allan-Pinkerton&lt;/ref&gt; He left school at the age of 10 after his father's death. Pinkerton read voraciously and was largely self-educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA215306197&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;p=ITOF&amp;asid=5181307a52e544f556bfca3b67b72027|title = Allan Pinkerton: America's first private eye (1819–1884)|last = Hunt|first = Russell A.|date = 2009|journal = The Forensic Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cooper (profession)|cooper]] by trade,&lt;ref&gt;Seiple 2015, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkerton was active in the Scottish [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;Seiple 2015, pp. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; He secretly married Joan Carfrae (1822–1887) from [[Duddingston]], then a singer, in Glasgow on 13 March 1842.&lt;ref&gt;ScotlandsPeople OPR Banns &amp; Marriages Record 644/001 0420 0539 http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkerton emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1842.

Pinkerton was not raised in a religious upbringing, and was a lifelong [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although christened by a Baptist minister in the Gorbals (August 25, 1819), he had a churchless upbringing and was a lifelong atheist.&quot; Richard Davenport-Hines, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49497 'Pinkerton, Allan (1819–1884)'], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 (accessed May 2, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843 Pinkerton heard of [[Dundee Township, Kane County, Illinois|Dundee Township, Illinois]], fifty miles northwest of Chicago on the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]].&lt;ref name=Horan13&gt;{{cite book|last=Horan|first=James D.|title=The Pinkertons: The Detective Dynasty That Made History|url=https://archive.org/details/pinkertonsdetec00hora|url-access=registration|orig-year=First published 1967|year=1969|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/pinkertonsdetec00hora/page/13 13]|chapter=Chapter 1: Glasgow 1819–1842}}&lt;/ref&gt; He built a cabin and started a cooperage, sending for his wife in Chicago when their cabin was complete.&lt;ref name=Horan13/&gt;  As early as 1844, Pinkerton worked for the Chicago abolitionist leaders, and his Dundee home was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horan|first=James D.|title=The Pinkertons: The Detective Dynasty That Made History|url=https://archive.org/details/pinkertonsdetec00hora|url-access=registration|orig-year=First published 1967|year=1969|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/pinkertonsdetec00hora/page/19 19]|chapter=Chapter 3: The Frontier Abolitionist and the Move to Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinkerton first became interested in criminal detective work while wandering through the wooded groves around Dundee, looking for trees to make [[barrel| barrel staves]], when he came across a band of [[counterfeit money|counterfeiters]],&lt;ref&gt;Seiple 2015 pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; who may have been affiliated with the notorious [[Banditti of the Prairie]].  After observing their movements for some time he informed the local sheriff, who arrested them.  This later led to Pinkerton being appointed, in 1849, as the first police detective in [[Chicago]], [[Cook County, Illinois]].  In 1850, he partnered with Chicago attorney Edward Rucker in forming the North-Western Police Agency, which later became Pinkerton &amp; Co, and finally [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]], still in existence today as Pinkerton Consulting and Investigations, a subsidiary of [[Securitas AB]]. Pinkerton's business insignia was a wide open eye with the caption &quot;We never sleep.&quot; As the US [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|expanded in territory]], rail transport increased. Pinkerton's agency solved a series of [[train robbery|train robberies]] during the 1850s, first bringing Pinkerton into contact with [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]], then Chief Engineer and Vice President of the  [[Illinois Central Railroad]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]], the company's lawyer.

In 1859, he attended the secret meetings held by [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and [[Frederick Douglass]] in Chicago along with abolitionists John Jones and [[Henry O. Wagoner]]. At those meetings, Jones, Wagoner, and Pinkerton helped purchase clothes and supplies for Brown. Jones' wife, Mary, guessed that the supplies included the suit Brown was hanged in after the failure of [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]] in November 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Junger, Richard, &quot;Thinking Men and Women who Desire to Improve our Condition&quot;: Henry O.

==American Civil War==
[[File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|right|Pinkerton (left) with [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[John Alexander McClernand|Major General John A. McClernand]]]]
[[File:Allan Pinkerton on horseback, 1862.jpg|thumb|left|Pinkerton on horseback on the [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam Battlefield]] in 1862]]

When the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began, Pinkerton served as head of the Union Intelligence Service during the first two years, heading off an alleged [[Baltimore Plot|assassination plot]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] while guarding [[Abraham Lincoln]] on his way to Washington, D.C. as well as identifying troop numbers in military campaigns. His agents often worked undercover as [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers and sympathizers to gather military intelligence. Pinkerton himself served on several undercover missions as a Confederate soldier using the alias Major E.J. Allen.  He worked across the Deep South in the summer of 1861, focusing on fortifications and Confederate plans. He was found out in Memphis and barely escaped with his life. This counterintelligence work done by Pinkerton and his agents is comparable to the work done by today's [[United States Army Counterintelligence|U.S. Army Counterintelligence Special Agents]] in which Pinkerton's agency is considered an early predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Stockham|first=Braden|title=The Expanded Application of Forensic Science and Law Enforcement Methodologies in Army Counterintelligence|year=2017|publisher=Defense Technical Information Center|location=Fort Belvoir, VA|page=6|chapter=Chapter 2: Literature Review: Historical Background}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as Intelligence Service chief by [[Lafayette Baker]]; the Intelligence Service was the predecessor of the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]]. His work led to the establishment of the Federal secret service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Hart |editor-first=James D. |editor-last2=Leininger |editor-first2=Philip W. |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to American Literature |title=Pinkerton, Allan |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0195065480 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompanionthart }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the war==
Following Pinkerton's service with the [[Union Army]], he continued his pursuit of train robbers, including the [[Reno Gang]]. He was hired by the railroad express companies to track outlaw [[Jesse James]], but after Pinkerton failed to capture him, the railroad withdrew their financial support and Pinkerton continued to track James at his own expense. After James allegedly captured and killed one of Pinkerton's undercover agents (who was working undercover at the farm neighboring the James family's farmstead), he abandoned the chase. Some consider this failure Pinkerton's biggest defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stiles|first=T. J.|title=Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposed [[Labor unions in the United States|labor unions]]. In 1872, the [[Mid-nineteenth century Spain#La Gloriosa (1868–1873)|Spanish Government]] hired Pinkerton to help suppress a [[Ten Years' War|revolution]] in [[Cuba]] which intended to end slavery and give citizens the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;''Allan Pinkerton: The First Private Eye''. James Mackay  Review author[s]: [[Stephen H. Norwood]], The Journal of American History, Vol. 85, No. 3. (December, 1998), pp. 1106–1107.&lt;/ref&gt; If Pinkerton knew this, then it directly contradicts statements in his 1883 book ''The Spy of the Rebellion'', where he professes to be an ardent abolitionist and hater of slavery. The Spanish government abolished slavery in 1880 and a Royal Decree abolished the last vestiges of it in 1886.

==Death==
Allan Pinkerton died in [[Chicago]] on July 1, 1884. It is usually said that Pinkerton slipped on the pavement and bit his tongue, resulting in [[gangrene]]. Contemporary reports give conflicting causes, such as that he succumbed to a stroke (which he had a year earlier) or to [[malaria]], which he had contracted during a trip to the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Lanis, Edward Stanley.  ''Allan Pinkerton and the private detective institution'' (M.S. Thesis 1949). p. 170, University of Wisconsin, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was working on a system to centralize all criminal identification records, a [[NCIC|database]] now maintained by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].

[[File:Tomb of Allan Pinkerton.jpg|thumb|right|Pinkerton's Tomb, Graceland Cemetery, Chicago]]
Pinkerton is buried in [[Graceland Cemetery]], Chicago. He is a member of the [[Military Intelligence Hall of Fame]].

==Legacy==
After his death, the agency continued to operate and soon became a major force against the [[labor movement]] developing in the US and [[Canada]]. This effort changed the image of the Pinkertons for years. They were involved in numerous activities against labor during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including:

* The [[Homestead Strike]] (1892), the direct impetus for the federal [[Anti-Pinkerton Act]] of 1893, prohibiting the federal government from hiring its detectives
* The [[Pullman Strike]] (1894)
* The [[Wild Bunch]] Gang (1896)
* The [[Ludlow Massacre]] (1914)
* The [[La Follette Committee]] (1933–1937)

Despite his agency's later reputation for anti-labor activities, Pinkerton himself was heavily involved in pro-labor politics as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thrillingdetective.com/eyes/pinkerton.html |title=Allan J. Pinkerton |publisher=Thrillingdetective.com |access-date=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Pinkerton considered himself pro-labor, he opposed strikes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0rjRPnO7K4C&amp;q=allan+pinkerton+pro-labor&amp;pg=PA155 |title=Criminal justice |author= Joel Samaha |via=Google Books |date=2005|isbn=9780534645571 |access-date=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and distrusted labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/nation/jb_nation_pinkerto_4.html |title=Detective Allan Pinkerton Was Born in Glasgow, Scotland |publisher=Americaslibrary.gov |access-date=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allan Pinkerton was so famous that for decades after his death, his surname was a [[slang]] term for a [[private investigator|private eye]]. The &quot;Mr. Pinkerton&quot; novels, by American mystery writer  [[Zenith Jones Brown]] (under the pseudonym David Frome), were about Welsh-born amateur detective Evan Pinkerton and may have been inspired by the slang term.

==Writings==
Pinkerton produced numerous popular [[detective fiction|detective books]], ostensibly based on his own exploits and those of his agents. Some were published after his death, and they are considered to have been more motivated by a desire to promote his detective agency than a literary endeavour. Most historians believe that Allan Pinkerton hired [[ghostwriter]]s, but the books nonetheless bear his name and no doubt reflect his views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Allan Pinkerton: The First Private Eye|last=Mackay|first=James|publisher=Wiley and Sons|year=2007|location=New York|pages=208–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

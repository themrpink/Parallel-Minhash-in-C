London's ashes were buried on his property not far from the Wolf House. London's funeral took place on November 26, 1916, attended only by close friends, relatives, and workers of the property. In accordance with his wishes, he was cremated and buried next to some pioneer children, under a rock that belonged to the Wolf House. After Charmian's death in 1955, she was also cremated and then buried with her husband in the same spot that her husband chose. The grave is marked by a mossy boulder. The buildings and property were later preserved as [[Jack London State Historic Park]], in [[Glen Ellen, California|Glen Ellen]], California.

===Suicide debate===
Because he was using morphine, many older sources describe London's death as a suicide, and some still do.&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bartleby.com/65/lo/London-J.html &quot;Jack London&quot;], &quot;Beset in his later years by alcoholism and financial difficulties, London committed suicide at the age of 40.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This conjecture appears to be a rumor, or speculation based on incidents in his fiction writings. His death certificate{{sfn|The Jack London Online Collection: Jack London's death certificate}} gives the cause as [[uremia]], following acute [[renal colic]].

The biographer Stasz writes, &quot;Following London's death, for a number of reasons, a biographical myth developed in which he has been portrayed as an alcoholic womanizer who committed suicide. Recent scholarship based upon firsthand documents challenges this caricature.&quot;{{sfn|The Jack London Online Collection: Biography}} Most biographers, including Russ Kingman, now agree he died of uremia aggravated by an accidental morphine overdose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacklondons.net/nosuicide.html &quot;Did Jack London Commit Suicide?&quot;&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914134621/http://www.jacklondons.net/nosuicide.html|date=September 14, 2008}}, The World of Jack London&lt;/ref&gt;

London's fiction featured several suicides.  In his autobiographical memoir ''[[John Barleycorn (novel)|John Barleycorn]]'', he claims, as a youth, to have drunkenly stumbled overboard into the [[San Francisco Bay]], &quot;some maundering fancy of going out with the tide suddenly obsessed me&quot;. He said he drifted and nearly succeeded in drowning before sobering up and being rescued by fishermen. In the dénouement of ''[[The Little Lady of the Big House]]'', the heroine, confronted by the pain of a mortal gunshot wound, undergoes a physician-assisted suicide by morphine. Also, in ''[[Martin Eden]]'', the principal protagonist, who shares certain characteristics with London, drowns himself.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

== Plagiarism accusations ==
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:JackLondon-office-1916.jpg|thumb|upright|London in his office, 1916]]

London was vulnerable to accusations of plagiarism, both because he was such a conspicuous, prolific, and successful writer and because of his methods of working. He wrote in a letter to Elwyn Hoffman, &quot;expression, you see—with me—is far easier than invention.&quot; He purchased plots and novels from the young [[Sinclair Lewis]] and used incidents from newspaper clippings as writing material.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In July 1901, two pieces of fiction appeared within the same month: London's &quot;[[Moon-Face]]&quot;, in the ''San Francisco Argonaut,'' and [[Frank Norris]]' &quot;The Passing of Cock-eye Blacklock&quot;, in ''[[Century Magazine]]''. Newspapers showed the similarities between the stories, which London said were &quot;quite different in manner of treatment, [but] patently the same in foundation and motive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Literary Zoo |journal=Life |date=Jan–Jun 1907 |volume=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=56JGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130 |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; London explained both writers based their stories on the same newspaper account. A year later, it was discovered that Charles Forrest McLean had published a fictional story also based on the same incident.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 1906, the ''[[New York World]]'' published &quot;deadly parallel&quot; columns showing eighteen passages from London's short story &quot;Love of Life&quot; side by side with similar passages from a nonfiction article by Augustus Biddle and J. K. Macdonald, titled &quot;Lost in the Land of the Midnight Sun&quot;.{{sfn|Kingman|1979|p=118}} London noted the ''World'' did not accuse him of &quot;plagiarism&quot;, but only of &quot;identity of time and situation&quot;, to which he defiantly &quot;pled guilty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to &quot;The Bookman,&quot; April 10, 1906, quoted in full in {{cite book |title=No mentor but myself: Jack London on writing and writers |author1=Jack London |author2=Dale L.

It charged me with identity of time and situation. Certainly I plead guilty, and I am glad that the ''World'' was intelligent enough not to charge me with identity of language.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The most serious charge of plagiarism was based on London's &quot;The Bishop's Vision&quot;, Chapter 7 of his novel ''[[The Iron Heel]]'' (1908). The chapter is nearly identical to an ironic essay that [[Frank Harris]] published in 1901, titled &quot;The Bishop of London and Public Morality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=No mentor but myself: Jack London on writing and writers |author1=Jack London |author2=Dale L.

London insisted he had clipped a reprint of the article, which had appeared in an American newspaper, and believed it to be a genuine speech delivered by the [[Bishop of London]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Atheism===
London was an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart Gabel 2012 14&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Jack London: a Man in Search of Meaning: A Jungian Perspective |year=2012 |publisher=AuthorHouse |isbn=9781477283332 |page=14 |author=Stewart Gabel |quote=When he was tramping, arrested and jailed for one month for vagrancy at about 19 years of age, he listed &quot;atheist&quot; as his religion on the necessary forms (Kershaw, 1997).}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is quoted as saying, &quot;I believe that when I am dead, I am dead.

=== Socialism ===
London wrote from a socialist viewpoint, which is evident in his novel ''[[The Iron Heel]]''. Neither a theorist nor an intellectual socialist, London's socialism grew out of his life experience. As London explained in his essay, &quot;How I Became a Socialist&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/WarOfTheClasses/socialist.html |title=War of the Classes: How I Became a Socialist |website=london.sonoma.edu |access-date=April 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112150432/http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/WarOfTheClasses/socialist.html |archive-date=January 12, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; his views were influenced by his experience with people at the bottom of the social pit. His optimism and individualism faded, and he vowed never to do more hard physical work than necessary. He wrote that his individualism was hammered out of him, and he was politically reborn. He often closed his letters &quot;Yours for the Revolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See Labor (1994) p. 546 for one example, a letter from London to William E. Walling dated November 30, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

London joined the [[Socialist Labor Party]] in April 1896. In the same year, the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' published a story about the twenty-year-old London's giving nightly speeches in Oakland's [[Frank H. Ogawa Plaza|City Hall Park]], an activity he was arrested for a year later. In 1901, he left the Socialist Labor Party and joined the new [[Socialist Party of America]]. He ran unsuccessfully as the high-profile Socialist candidate for mayor of Oakland in 1901 (receiving 245 votes) and 1905 (improving to 981 votes), toured the country lecturing on socialism in 1906, and published two collections of essays about socialism: ''War of the Classes'' (1905) and ''Revolution, and other Essays'' (1906).

Stasz notes that &quot;London regarded the [[Industrial Workers of the World|Wobblies]] as a welcome addition to the [[Socialist]] cause, although he never joined them in going so far as to recommend sabotage.&quot;{{sfn|Stasz|2001|p=100}} Stasz mentions a personal meeting between London and [[Big Bill Haywood]] in 1912.{{sfn|Stasz|2001|p=156}}

In his late (1913) book ''The Cruise of the Snark'', London writes about appeals to him for membership of the ''Snark'''s crew from office workers and other &quot;toilers&quot; who longed for escape from the cities, and of being cheated by workmen.

In his Glen Ellen ranch years, London felt some ambivalence toward socialism and complained about the &quot;inefficient Italian labourers&quot; in his employ.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=245}} In 1916, he resigned from the Glen Ellen chapter of the Socialist Party, but stated emphatically he did so &quot;because of its lack of fire and fight, and its loss of emphasis on the class struggle.&quot; In an unflattering portrait of London's ranch days, California cultural historian [[Kevin Starr]] refers to this period as &quot;post-socialist&quot; and says &quot;... by 1911 ... London was more bored by the class struggle than he cared to admit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpMI4z-tDPMC&amp;pg=PA215 |title=Americans and the California Dream |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1973 |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |isbn=0-19-501-644-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[George Orwell]], however, identified a fascist strain in London's outlook:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But temperamentally he was very different from the majority of Marxists.  With his love of violence and physical strength, his belief in 'natural aristocracy', his animal-worship and exaltation of the primitive, he had in him what one might fairly call a [[Fascist]] strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=George Orwell |title=George Orwell: My country right or left, 1940–1943 |url=https://archive.org/details/georgeorwellcoll00orwe |url-access=registration |year=2000 |publisher=David R Godine |page=[https://archive.org/details/georgeorwellcoll00orwe/page/31 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Unnecessary, he's never known London--&gt;

=== Race ===
{{Original research section|date=January 2016}}
[[File:Johnson jeff.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeffries (left) vs. Johnson, 1910]]
London shared common concerns among many European Americans in California about [[Asian immigration to the United States|Asian immigration]], described as &quot;[[yellow peril|the yellow peril]]&quot;; he used the latter term as the title of a 1904 essay.{{sfn|The Jack London Online Collection: The Yellow Peril}} This theme was also the subject of a story he wrote in 1910 called &quot;[[The Unparalleled Invasion]]&quot;. Presented as an historical essay set in the future, the story narrates events between 1976 and 1987, in which China, with an ever-increasing population, is taking over and colonizing its neighbors with the intention of taking over the entire Earth. The western nations respond with [[biological warfare]] and bombard China with dozens of the most infectious diseases.{{sfn|The Jack London Online Collection: The Unparalleled Invasion}} On his fears about China, he admits, &quot;it must be taken into consideration that the above postulate is itself a product of Western race-egotism, urged by our belief in our own righteousness and fostered by a faith in ourselves which may be as erroneous as are most fond race fancies.&quot;

By contrast, many of London's short stories are notable for their empathetic portrayal of Mexican (&quot;The Mexican&quot;), Asian (&quot;The Chinago&quot;), and Hawaiian (&quot;Koolau the Leper&quot;) characters. London's war correspondence from the [[Russo-Japanese War]], as well as his unfinished novel ''Cherry'', show he admired much about Japanese customs and capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacklondons.net/Journalism/jackLondonsWar.html &quot;Jack London's War&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017134905/http://www.jacklondons.net/Journalism/jackLondonsWar.html |date=October 17, 2012 }}, Dale L. Walker, ''The World of Jack London''. &quot;According to London's reportage, the Russians were &quot;sluggish&quot; in battle, while &quot;The Japanese understand the utility of things. Reserves they consider should be used not only to strengthen the line...but in the moment of victory to clinch victory hard and fast...Verily, nothing short of a miracle can wreck a plan they have once started and put into execution.&quot;&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; London's writings have been popular among the Japanese, who believe he portrayed them positively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Jeanne Campbell Reesman, ''Jack London's Racial Lives: A Critical Biography'', University of Georgia Press, 2009, pp. 323–24&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;Koolau the Leper&quot;, London describes Koolau, who is a Hawaiian leper—and thus a very different sort of &quot;superman&quot; than Martin Eden—and who fights off an entire cavalry troop to elude capture, as &quot;indomitable spiritually—a&amp;nbsp;... magnificent rebel&quot;. This character is based on Hawaiian leper [[Kaluaikoolau]], who in 1893 [[Leper War on Kauaʻi|revolted and resisted capture]] from forces of the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] in the [[Kalalau Valley]].

An amateur boxer and avid boxing fan, London reported on the 1910 Johnson–Jeffries fight, in which the black boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] vanquished [[James J. Jeffries|Jim Jeffries]], known as the &quot;Great White Hope&quot;. In 1908, London had reported on an earlier fight of Johnson's, contrasting the black boxer's coolness and intellectual style, with the apelike appearance and fighting style of his Canadian opponent, [[Tommy Burns (Canadian boxer)|Tommy Burns]]:
{{Quote |text=[What won] on Saturday was bigness, coolness, quickness, cleverness, and vast physical superiority&amp;nbsp;... Because a white man wishes a white man to win, this should not prevent him from giving absolute credit to the best man, even when that best man was black. All hail to Johnson.&amp;nbsp;... [Johnson was] superb. He was impregnable&amp;nbsp;... as inaccessible as [[Mont Blanc]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10174989 &quot;Jack London on the Fight&quot;], ''The Argus'', 28 December 1908, at National Library of Australia&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Those who defend London against charges of racism cite the letter he wrote to the ''Japanese-American Commercial Weekly'' in 1913:

{{quote|In reply to yours of August 16, 1913. First of all, I should say by stopping the stupid newspaper from always fomenting race prejudice. This of course, being impossible, I would say, next, by educating the people of Japan so that they will be too intelligently tolerant to respond to any call to race prejudice. And, finally, by realizing, in industry and government, of socialism—which last word is merely a word that stands for the actual application of in the affairs of men of the theory of the Brotherhood of Man.

In the meantime the nations and races are only unruly boys who have not yet grown to the stature of men. So we must expect them to do unruly and boisterous things at times. And, just as boys grow up, so the races of mankind will grow up and laugh when they look back upon their childish quarrels.&lt;ref&gt;Labor, Earle, Robert C. Leitz, III, and I.

In 1996, after the [[Whitehorse, Yukon|City of Whitehorse]], [[Yukon]], renamed a street in honor of London, protests over London's alleged racism forced the city to change the name of &quot;Jack London Boulevard&quot;{{failed verification|date=January 2016}} back to &quot;Two-mile Hill&quot;.{{sfn|Lundberg}}

===Eugenics===
With other modernist writers of the day,&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Thomas C., ''Illiberal Reformers: Race, Eugenics, and American Economics in the Progressive Era'', Princeton University Press, Princeton Univ. Press, 2016, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; London supported [[eugenics]],&lt;ref name=Swift2002/&gt;. The notion of &quot;good breeding&quot; complimented the Progressive era scientism, the belief that humans assort along a hierarchy by race, religion, and ethnicity. The [[Progressive Era]] catalog of inferiority offered basis for threats to American Anglo-Saxon racial integrity. London wrote to Frederick H. Robinson of the periodical ''Medical Review of Reviews'', stating, &quot;I believe the future belongs to eugenics, and will be determined by the practice of eugenics.&quot;{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=109}} Although this led some to argue for [[forced sterilization]] of criminals or those deemed [[Intellectual disability|feeble-minded]].&lt;ref&gt;''Three Generations, No Imbeciles: Eugenics, the Supreme Court'', and Buck V. Bell, JHU Press, October 6, 2008, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;, London did not express this extreme. His short story &quot;[[Told in the Drooling Ward]]&quot; is from the viewpoint of a surprisingly astute &quot;feebled-minded&quot; person. 

Hensley argues that London's novel ''[[Before Adam]]'' (1906–07) reveals pro-eugenic themes.&lt;ref name=Hensely2002/&gt; London advised his collaborator [[Anna Strunsky]] during preparation of ''[[The Kempton-Wace Letters]]'' that he would take the role of eugenics in mating, while she would argue on behalf of romantic love. (Love won the argument.) &lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jay, ''Author Under Sail,'' Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1014, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Valley of the Moon (novel)|The Valley of the Moon]]'' emphasizes the theme of &quot;real Americans,&quot; the Anglo Saxon, yet in ''[[Little Lady of the Big House]]'', London is more nuanced. The protagonist's argument is not that all white men are superior, but that there are more superior ones among whites than in other races. By encouraging the best in any race to mate will improve its population qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Craid, Layne Parish, &quot;Sex and Science in London's America,&quot; in Williams, Jay, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Jack London'', Oxford Univ. Press, 2017, pp. 340-341.&lt;/ref&gt; Living in Hawaii challenged his orthodoxy. In &quot;My Hawaiian Aloha,&quot; London noted the liberal intermarrying of races, concluding how &quot;little Hawaii, with its hotch potch races, is making a better demonstration than the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;London, Charmian, ''Our Hawaii: Islands and Islanders'', Macmillan, 1922, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

London's true métier was the short story ... London's true genius lay in the short form, 7,500 words and under, where the flood of images in his teeming brain and the innate power of his narrative gift were at once constrained and freed. His stories that run longer than the magic 7,500 generally—but certainly not always—could have benefited from self-editing.
}}

London's &quot;strength of utterance&quot; is at its height in his stories, and they are painstakingly well-constructed.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} &quot;[[To Build a Fire]]&quot; is the best known of all his stories. Set in the harsh Klondike, it recounts the haphazard trek of a new arrival who has ignored an old-timer's warning about the risks of traveling alone. Falling through the ice into a creek in seventy-five-below weather, the unnamed man is keenly aware that survival depends on his untested skills at quickly building a fire to dry his clothes and warm his extremities. After publishing a tame version of this story—with a sunny outcome—in ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' in 1902, London offered a second, more severe take on the man's predicament in ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' in 1908. Reading both provides an illustration of London's growth and maturation as a writer. As Labor (1994) observes: &quot;To compare the two versions is itself an instructive lesson in what distinguished a great work of literary art from a good children's story.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;To Build a Fire&quot; group=&quot;upper-alpha&quot; /&gt;

Other stories from the Klondike period include: &quot;All Gold Canyon&quot;, about a battle between a gold [[Prospecting|prospector]] and a [[land claim|claim jumper]]; &quot;[[The Law of Life]]&quot;, about an aging American Indian man abandoned by his tribe and left to die; &quot;Love of Life&quot;, about a trek by a prospector across the Canadian tundra; &quot;To the Man on Trail,&quot; which tells the story of a prospector fleeing the Mounted Police in a sled race, and raises the question of the contrast between written law and morality; and &quot;An Odyssey of the North,&quot; which raises questions of conditional morality, and paints a sympathetic portrait of a man of mixed White and [[Aleut people|Aleut]] ancestry.

London was a [[boxing]] fan and an avid amateur boxer. &quot;A Piece of Steak&quot; is a tale about a match between older and younger boxers. It contrasts the differing experiences of youth and age but also raises the social question of the treatment of aging workers. &quot;The Mexican&quot; combines boxing with a social theme, as a young Mexican endures an unfair fight and ethnic prejudice to earn money with which to aid the revolution.

Several of London's stories would today be classified as science fiction. &quot;The Unparalleled Invasion&quot; describes [[germ warfare]] against China; &quot;Goliath&quot; is about an irresistible energy weapon; &quot;The Shadow and the Flash&quot; is a tale about two brothers who take different routes to achieving invisibility; &quot;A Relic of the Pliocene&quot; is a tall tale about an encounter of a modern-day man with a [[mammoth]]. &quot;[[The Red One]]&quot; is a late story from a period when London was intrigued by the theories of the [[psychiatrist]] and writer [[Carl Jung|Jung]]. It tells of an island tribe held in thrall by an extraterrestrial object.

Some nineteen original collections of short stories were published during London's brief life or shortly after his death. There have been several posthumous anthologies drawn from this pool of stories. Many of these stories were located in the Klondike and the Pacific. A collection of ''[[Jack London's San Francisco Stories]]'' was published in October 2010 by Sydney Samizdat Press.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20181106190339/https://www.jacklondon-sanfrancisco.com/ Jack London: San Francisco Stories] (Edited by Matthew Asprey; Preface by Rodger Jacobs)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Novels ===
[[File:J London writing 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|London writing, 1905]]

London's most famous novels are ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', ''[[White Fang]]'', ''[[The Sea-Wolf]]'', ''[[The Iron Heel]]'', and ''[[Martin Eden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;These are the five novels selected by editor Donald Pizer for inclusion in the [[Library of America]] series.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter dated December 27, 1901, London's Macmillan publisher [[George Platt Brett, Sr.]], said &quot;he believed Jack's fiction represented 'the very best kind of work' done in America.&quot;{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=109}}

Critic [[Maxwell Geismar]] called ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' &quot;a beautiful prose poem&quot;; editor Franklin Walker said that it &quot;belongs on a shelf with ''[[Walden]]'' and ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]''&quot;; and novelist [[E.L. Doctorow]] called it &quot;a mordant parable ... his masterpiece.&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The historian Dale L. Walker&lt;ref name=&quot;DaleWalker&quot; /&gt; commented:

{{quote|
Jack London was an uncomfortable novelist, that form too long for his natural impatience and the quickness of his mind. His novels, even the best of them, are hugely flawed.
}}

Some critics have said that his novels are episodic and resemble linked short stories. Dale L. Walker writes:

{{quote|
''[[The Star Rover]]'', that magnificent experiment, is actually a series of short stories connected by a unifying device ... ''Smoke Bellew'' is a series of stories bound together in a novel-like form by their reappearing protagonist, Kit Bellew; and ''[[John Barleycorn (novel)|John Barleycorn]]'' ... is a synoptic series of short episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaleWalker&quot; /&gt;
}}

[[Ambrose Bierce]] said of ''[[The Sea-Wolf]]'' that &quot;the great thing—and it is among the greatest of things—is that tremendous creation, Wolf Larsen ... the hewing out and setting up of such a figure is enough for a man to do in one lifetime.&quot; However, he noted, &quot;The love element, with its absurd suppressions, and impossible proprieties, is awful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letters of Ambrose Bierce, ed. S. T. Joshi, Tryambak Sunand Joshi, David E. Schultz, Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Iron Heel]]'' is an example of a [[dystopian]] novel that anticipates and influenced [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelden&quot;&gt;''Orwell: the Authorized Biography'' by Michael Shelden, [[HarperCollins]] {{ISBN|978-0-06-092161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; London's socialist politics are explicitly on display here. ''The Iron Heel'' meets the contemporary definition of [[soft science fiction]]. ''[[The Star Rover]]'' (1915) is also science fiction.

=== Apocrypha ===

==== Jack London Credo ====
London's [[literary executor]], Irving Shepard, quoted a ''Jack London Credo'' in an introduction to a 1956 collection of London stories:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I would rather be ashes than dust!
I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.
I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.
The function of man is to live, not to exist.
I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them.
I shall use my time.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The biographer Stasz notes that the passage &quot;has many marks of London's style&quot; but the only line that could be safely attributed to London was the first.{{sfn| Jack London Online: FAQ, Credo}} The words Shepard quoted were from a story in the ''San Francisco Bulletin'', December 2, 1916, by journalist Ernest J. Hopkins, who visited the ranch just weeks before London's death. Stasz notes, &quot;Even more so than today journalists' quotes were unreliable or even sheer inventions,&quot; and says no direct source in London's writings has been found. However, at least one line, according to Stasz, is authentic, being referenced by London and written in his own hand in the autograph book of Australian suffragette [[Vida Goldstein]]:

Dear Miss Goldstein:–
Seven years ago I wrote you that I'd rather be ashes than dust.  I still subscribe to that sentiment.
Sincerely yours,
Jack London
Jan. 13, 1909{{sfn|The Jack London Online Collection: Credo}}

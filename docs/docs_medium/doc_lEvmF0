The expedition sailed down the west coast of Africa; provisions were picked up on the way at the Portuguese fortress of [[São Jorge de Mina]] on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Gold Coast]]. After sailing south of modern-day [[Angola]], Dias reached the Golfo da Conceicão ([[Walvis Bay]], in modern [[Namibia]]) by December. Continuing south, he discovered Angra dos Ilheus, then was hit by a violent storm. Thirteen days later, from the open ocean, he searched the coast again to the east, discovering and using the [[Volta do Mar|westerlies winds]]—the [[ocean gyre]], but finding just ocean. Having rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] at a considerable distance to the west and southwest, he turned east, and taking advantage of the winds of Antarctica that blow strongly in the South Atlantic, sailed northeast. After 30 days without seeing land, he entered what he named Aguada de São Brás (Bay of [[Saint Blaise]])—later renamed [[Mossel Bay]]—on 4 February 1488. Dias's expedition reached its furthest point on 12 March 1488 when it anchored at [[Kwaaihoek]], near the mouth of the [[Boesmans River (Eastern Cape)|Boesmans River]], where a [[padrão]]—the Padrão de São Gregório—was erected before turning back.&lt;ref name=eera&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/bartholomeu-dias.htm |title=Bartholomeu Dias |author=Alchin KL, from  Elizabethan Era |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dias wanted to continue to India, but he was forced to turn back when his crew refused to go further and the rest of the officers unanimously favoured returning to Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Howard |last=Spoken |year=2006 |title=The World's History |edition=Third |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=New Jersey, U.S. |page=444 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only on the return voyage that he actually discovered the [[Cape of Good Hope]], in May 1488. Dias returned to [[Lisbon]] in December of that year, after an absence of 16 months and 17 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |inline=1|wstitle=Bartolomeu Dias|prescript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the passage around southern Africa was significant because, for the first time, Europeans could trade directly with India and the [[Far East]], bypassing the overland Euro-Asian route with its expensive European, Middle Eastern and Central Asian [[Wholesaler|middlemen]]. The official report of the expedition has been lost.{{citation needed|date = February 2012}}

Dias originally named the Cape of Good Hope the Cape of Storms (''Cabo das Tormentas''). It was later renamed (by King [[John II of Portugal]]) the Cape of Good Hope (''Cabo da Boa Esperança'') because it represented the opening of a route to the east.{{citation needed|date = February 2012}}

==Follow-up voyages==
After these early attempts, the Portuguese took a decade-long break from Indian Ocean exploration. During that hiatus, it is likely that they received valuable information from a secret agent, [[Pêro da Covilhã]], who had been sent overland to India and returned with reports useful to their navigators.&lt;ref&gt;David Fromkin (2000), ''The Way of the World'', Vintage Books (New York, U.S.), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using his experience with explorative travel, Dias helped in the construction of the ''[[São Gabriel (ship)|São Gabriel]]'' and its sister ship the ''São Rafael'' that were used in 1498 by [[Vasco da Gama]] to sail past the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and continue to India. Dias only participated in the first leg of Da Gama's voyage, until the [[Cape Verde Islands]]. Two years later he was one of the captains of the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|second Indian expedition]], headed by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]. This flotilla first reached the coast of [[Brazil]], landing there in 1500, and then continued east to India. Dias perished near the [[Cape of Good Hope]] that he presciently had named ''Cape of Storms''. Four ships, including Dias's, encountered a huge storm off the cape and were lost on 29 May 1500. A shipwreck found in 2008 by the Namdeb Diamond Corporation off [[Namibia]] was at first thought to be Dias's ship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | URL = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7376259.stm | title =  Namibia finds treasure shipwreck  | work = BBC News  | date = 1 May 2008 | accessdate = 1 May 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080506023410/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7376259.stm | archive-date= 6 May 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recovered coins come from a later time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ml.ci.uc.pt/mhonarchive/archport/msg03261.html |title=Destroços descobertos no Atlântico Sul devem ser de Barco português |work=Público |language=pt |date=4 May 2008 |accessdate=4 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228082212/http://ml.ci.uc.pt/mhonarchive/archport/msg03261.html |archive-date=28 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Dias was married and had two sons
*Simão Dias de Novais, who died unmarried and without issue. 
*António Dias de Novais, a [[Knight]] of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]], married to (apparently his relative, since the surname ''Novais'' was transmitted through  her brother's offspring) Joana Fernandes, daughter of Fernão Pires and wife Guiomar Montês (and sister of Brites Fernandes and Fernão Pires, married to Inês Nogueira, daughter of Jorge Nogueira and wife, and had issue). Dias's grandson [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] was a Portuguese colonizer of Africa in the 16th century. Dias's granddaughter Guiomar de Novais married twice, to Dom Rodrigo de Castro, son of Dom Nuno de Castro and wife Joana da Silveira, by whom she had Dona Paula de Novais and Dona Violante de Castro, both of whom died unmarried and without issue, and to Pedro Correia da Silva, natural son of Cristóvão Correia da Silva, without issue.{{citation needed|date = February 2012}}

{{Nihongo|'''Emperor Go-Uda'''|後宇多天皇|''Go-Uda-tennō''|17 December 1267 – 16 July 1324}} was the 91st [[emperor of Japan]], according to the traditional order of succession.  His reign spanned the years from 1274 through 1287.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). ''Annales des empereurs du Japon,'' pp. 262–268; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki.'' pp. 233–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

This 13th-century sovereign was named after the 9th-century [[Emperor Uda]] and ''go-'' (後), translates literally as &quot;later&quot;; and thus, he is sometimes called the &quot;Later Emperor Uda,&quot; or in some older sources, may be identified as &quot;Emperor Uda, the second&quot; or as &quot;Emperor Uda II.&quot;

==Genealogy==
Before his ascension to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], his personal name (''imina'') was Yohito (世仁).&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 262; Varley, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the second son of [[Emperor Kameyama]]. They were from the [[Daikaku-ji]] line.

==Events of Go-Uda's life==
Yohito''-shinnō'' became crown prince in 1268.  According to the terms of the late emperor's will (Go-Saga died in 1272), in 1274, he would become emperor upon the death or abdication of [[Emperor Kameyama]].

* '''6 March 1274''' (''[[Bun'ei]] 11, 26th day of the 1st month''): In the 15th year of Kameyama''-tennō'' 's reign (亀山天皇十五年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (''senso'') was received by his cousin.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 261; Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]], [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''4 May 1274''' (''Bun'ei 11, 26th day of the 3rd month''):  Emperor Go-Uda is said to have acceded to the throne (''sokui'').&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 262; Varley, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The retired Emperor Kameyama continued to exercise power as [[Cloistered rule|cloistered emperor]].

During his reign, the unsuccessful [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] occurred, first in 1274 and again in 1281. Though they established a [[beachhead]] at [[Hakata-ku, Fukuoka|Hakata]], [[Kyushu]], they were driven out within a short time.

* '''23 November 1275''' (''[[Kenji (era)|Kenji]] 1, 5th day of the 11th month''): Hirohito''-shinnō'' was named Crown Prince and heir to his first cousin, the ''Daikakuji-tō'' Emperor Go-Uda.  This was the result of political maneuvering by Hirohito's father, the Jimyōin-tō Emperor Go-Fukakusa.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 262, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1287, retired [[Emperor Go-Fukakusa]], dissatisfied with the fact that his own lineage (the ''Jimyōin-tō'') did not control the throne, while that of his younger brother, the retired [[Emperor Kameyama]] (the ''Daikakuji-tō'') did, persuaded both the [[Kamakura shogunate|Bakufu]] and the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|imperial court]] to compel the Emperor to abdicate in favor of Go-Fukakusa's son ([[Emperor Fushimi]]).

After this time, the struggle between the Jimyōin-tō and the Daikakuji-tō over the imperial throne continued.  After Go-Uda's abdication, his Daikakuji-tō controlled the throne from 1301 to 1308 ([[Emperor Go-Nijo|Emperor Go-Nijō]]) and again from 1318 until the [[Nanboku-cho|era of northern and southern courts]] (begun 1332) when they became the southern court (ending in 1392).

Go-Uda was cloistered emperor during the reign of his own son, Go-Nijō, from 1301 until 1308, and again from 1318, when his second son Go-Daigo took the throne until 1321, when Go-Daigo began direct rule.

[[File:Go-Uda misasagi.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial Shinto shrine and mausoleum honoring Emperor Go-Uda.]]
* '''16 July 1324''' (''[[Genkō (first)|Genkō]] 4, 25th day of the 6th month''): Go-Uda died at age 58.&lt;ref&gt;Varley, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor Go-Uda's Imperial mausoleum is the ''Rengebuji no misasagi'' (蓮華峯寺陵) in [[Ukyō-ku, Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). ''The Imperial House of Japan,'' p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kugyō==
''Kugyō'' (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the [[Emperor of Japan]] in pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Go-Uda's reign, this apex of the ''[[Daijō-kan]] included:
* ''[[Sesshō]]'', [[Kujō Tadaie]], 1274
* ''Sesshō'', [[Ichijō Ietsune]], 1274–1275
* ''Sesshō'', [[Takatsukasa Kanehira]],	1275–1278
* ''[[Kampaku]]'', Takatsukasa Kanehira, 1278–1287
* ''Kampaku'', [[Nijō Morotada]], 1287–1289
* ''[[Sadaijin]]''
* ''[[Udaijin]]''
* ''[[Nadaijin]]''
* ''[[Dainagon]]''

==Eras of Go-Uda's reign==
The years of Go-Uda's reign are more specifically identified by more than one [[Japanese era names|era name]] or ''[[nengō]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Bun'ei]]''                (1264–1275)
* ''[[Kenji (Japanese era)|Kenji]]''  (1275–1278)
* ''[[Kōan (Kamakura period)|Kōan]]''             (1278–1288)

'''Thomas Edmund Dewey''' (March 24, 1902 – March 16, 1971) was an American lawyer, prosecutor, and politician. Raised in [[Owosso, Michigan]], Dewey was a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He served as the [[List of Governors of New York|47th governor of New York]] from 1943 to 1954. In [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]], he was the Republican Party's nominee for [[President of the United States|president]], but lost the election to incumbent [[Franklin D.

As a [[New York City]] prosecutor and [[District Attorney]] in the 1930s and early 1940s, Dewey was relentless in his effort to curb the power of the [[American Mafia]] and of [[organized crime]] in general. Most famously, he successfully prosecuted [[American Mafia|Mafioso]] [[boss (crime)|kingpin]] [[Lucky Luciano|Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano]] on charges of [[forced prostitution]] in 1936. Luciano was given a 30- to 50-year prison sentence. He also prosecuted and convicted [[Waxey Gordon]], another prominent New York City gangster and [[rum-running|bootlegger]], on charges of [[tax evasion]]. Dewey almost succeeded in apprehending [[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish mobster]] [[Dutch Schultz]] as well, but Schultz was murdered in 1935 in a hit ordered by [[The Commission (mafia)|The Commission]] itself; he had disobeyed The Commission's order forbidding him from making an attempt on Dewey's life.

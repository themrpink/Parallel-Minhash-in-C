John George showed a strong interest in the military and even while he was still the heir led Saxonian Army forces in the Rhine Campaign.

==Career as elector==
After his accession as Elector, he reduced the size of the royal household and began with the establishment of a small [[standing army]] of 12,000 men, after the model of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] and managed to extract from the states of the realm a commitment to contribute funds. The Privy War Chancellery (''geheime Kriegskanzlei'') was set up as the highest military authority. Extreme pressure was used to obtain recruits for the new army. He always neglected home affairs.

In foreign policy, he was less inconstant than his father. He broke off relations with the French crown and strove energetically to win Brandenburg and other German princes for the [[Imperial war]] against the French aggressor.

Valued as an ally by the Habsburg court, he was nevertheless viewed with extreme distrust and was not able to overall command of all the imperial troops in the face of a Turkish invasion and he did not obtain the means (food supply and winter accommodation) necessary for the maintenance of his auxiliary troops. There was also the matter of John George's wish for [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] to decide a law case concerning a wooded area in the [[Ore Mountains]] (''Erzgebirge'') in his favour. The Emperor did not grant material support until the siege of [[Vienna]] made his situation look increasingly desperate. Johann Georg even led his 10,400 strong army against the Turks. However, there was strong opposition from the estates of Saxony, not only because this expensive campaign was exhausting the finances of the Electorate of Saxony but also because they were not pleased at this support for the catholic Emperor, who had often proceeded harshly against Protestants in his own country. At  [[Tulln an der Donau|Tulln]], on the Danube, he joined the Imperial army and they set off for the relief of Vienna. In the ensuing [[Battle of Vienna]] (12 September 1683) he commanded the left wing, where he demonstrated great personal courage. The battle call selected by the emperor &quot;''Maria Help''&quot; (which might carry Roman Catholic connotations) had been previously amended to &quot;Jesus and Maria help&quot; at the request of John George.

[[John III Sobieski|King John III of Poland]], who also took part in the battle, said of John George: &quot;''the Elector of Saxony is an honest man with a straight heart''&quot;.

John George also accompanied the Emperor after the victory when he entered Vienna. But on 15 September, without taking leave of the Emperor or the other commanders, he set off with his troops on the march back to Saxony, probably as a result of the brusque treatment he had been accorded as a Protestant.

In 1686 he again supported Leopold's [[Great Turkish War|Turkish War]]. For payment of 300,000 [[thaler]]s, he sent a troop of 5,000 men to the Emperor. In 1685 he had already hired out 3,000 Saxon nationals for 120,000 thalers to the [[Republic of Venice]] for their war in [[Morea]] on the Greek [[Peloponnese]] Peninsula.

He did not join the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|League of Augsburg]] of 1686 against France, but he did travel personally to [[The Hague]] in March 1688, to discuss with [[William III of England|Prince William III of Orange]], [[George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Duke George William of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], and [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Duke Frederick William of Brandenburg]] possible moves against [[Louis XIV]]. However, he did not directly support the forthcoming assumption of the English throne by William.

Following a renewed [[War of the Grand Alliance|invasion]] by France in (1689), he again led his troops into battle to protect [[Franconia]]. He later joined the army of [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine|Duke Charles V of Lorraine]] and took part in the siege of Mainz.

He later had to leave the theatre because of an illness but, against the advice of his physicians and advisors, he returned in May 1690 and with a reinforced alliance with the Emperor, took overall command of the imperial army. Success was limited, however, partly owing to personal skirmishes between John George, the Field Marshal [[Hans Adam von Schöning]] and the Austrian commander [[Aeneas de Caprara|Caprara]]; only the crossing of the Rhine at [[Sandhofen]] succeeded.

John George died shortly after in [[Tübingen]], where he had been brought, of an epidemic illness, probably [[Cholera]] or the [[Bubonic plague|Plague]]. He was buried in the [[Cathedral of Freiberg]].

==Children==
John George married [[Anna Sophie of Denmark|Anne Sophie]], daughter of [[Frederick III of Denmark|King Frederick III of Denmark and Norway]], in [[Copenhagen]] on 9 October 1666. They had two sons:
#[[John George IV, Elector of Saxony|Johann George IV]] (b. Dresden, 18 October 1668 – died of smallpox, Dresden, 28 May 1694), successor of his father as elector
#[[August II of Poland|Frederick Augustus I]] (b. Dresden, 22 May 1670 – died in Warsaw, 1 February 1733), successor of his brother as elector and later king of Poland.

He also had an illegitimate son by his mistress, the opera singer [[Margarita Salicola]]:
#''Johann Georg Maximilian von Fürstenhoff (b. 1686 – d. 1753), married first to Margareta Dorothea Kühler (d. 1738) and then to a Charlotte Emilie (who identity is unknown). From his first marriage he had two children: a son and a daughter, both unknown; the son apparently died young and the daughter married Philipp Christian von Kleinberg, but both spouses died in 1743''.

'''Frederick Christian''' ({{lang-de|Friedrich Christian}}; 5 September 1722 &amp;ndash; 17 December 1763) was the [[Prince-elector|Prince-Elector]] of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] for fewer than three months in 1763. He was a member of the [[Wettin (dynasty) | House of Wettin]]. He was the third but eldest surviving son of [[Augustus III of Poland|Frederick Augustus II]], [[prince-elector| Prince-Elector]] of [[Saxony]] and King of [[Poland]], by his wife, [[Maria Josepha of Austria]].

==Early life==
[[File:Friedrich Christian by Rosalba.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Frederick Christian c. 1739-40, by [[Rosalba Carriera]].]]
A weak child since his birth, he suffered paralysis in one foot and was dependent on wheelchairs early in life. In a well-known portrait, which shows his Wettin and Wittelsbach relatives around him, he appears in his wheelchair. Today, this painting is shown in the [[Nymphenburg Palace|Schloss Nymphenburg]]. His mother tried repeatedly to induce him to take monastic vows and renounce his succession rights in favour of his younger brothers, but he refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flathe&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first = Heinrich Theodor | last = Flathe | title = Friedrich Christian, Kurfürst von Sachsen | journal = [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]] (ADB) | volume = 7 | publisher = Duncker &amp; Humblot | place = Leipzig | year = 1878 | pages = 789–90 | language = German}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early deaths of his two older brothers, Frederick Augustus (1721), who was stillborn, and Joseph Augustus (1728), made him the heir to the throne. When his father died, on 5 October 1763, Frederick Christian succeeded him as Elector. 

Even before, Frederick Christian had written in his diary: &quot;''Princes exist for their subjects, not subjects for their princes. His subjects' wealth, public credit and a well-standing army make up the true happiness of a prince,''&quot; thereby openly declaring himself open to the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Schlechte&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first = Horst | last = Schlechte | title = Das geheime politische Tagebuch des Kurprinzen Friedrich Christian: 1751 bis 1757 | publisher = Böhlau-Verlag | place = Weimar | year = 1992 | ISBN = 3-7400-0105-4 | language = German}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known for his considerable musical talent.

==Marriage==
In [[Munich]] on 13 June 1747 (by proxy) and again in [[Dresden]] on 20 June 1747 (in person), Frederick Christian married his cousin [[Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria|Maria Antonia of Bavaria]]. Like him, she was exceptionally talented in music and the couple had nine children.

==Reign as Elector==
[[File:Pietro Antonio Rotari 10.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Frederick Christian as Elector of Saxony.]]
One of his first acts as Elector was the dismissal of the extremely unpopular prime minister, the Count [[Heinrich von Brühl]], who had plunged Saxony into crisis, first with his failed economic policy, but particularly by his catastrophic foreign policy, which caused the Electorate to become involved in the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Flathe&quot; /&gt;

He began to reconstruct the wrecked finances of his country through his &quot;''Rétablissements''&quot;: reforms of the policies of the electorate states. Through [[economic reconstruction]], he gave new life to the devastated and plundered land which his predecessors had left him.  Also introduced were measures to pare down the expenses of the court, and to simplify administration in accordance with principles of economy.  Most members of his government, such as [[Thomas von Fritsch]] of [[Leipzig]], [[Friedrich Ludwig Wurmb]], and [[Christian Gotthelf Gutschmied]] had middle-class origins.

After a reign of only 74 days, Frederick Christian died of smallpox.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flathe&quot;/&gt; He was buried in the [[Katholische Hofkirche|Hofkirche]] of Dresden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flathe&quot;/&gt;

Because Frederick Christian's eldest son was a minor, his brother Franz Xavier and the Dowager Electress Maria Antonia took the joint regency of the Electorate until the boy's majority.

[[File:RWS Tarot 01 Magician.jpg|thumb|200px|The Magician (I), an illustration from the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck]] first published in 1910]]

'''Magic''' is the practice of [[belief]]s, [[ritual]]s and/or actions which are said to control and manipulate, either natural or [[supernatural]], beings and forces.{{sfn|Hutton|2012|p=x}} Typically, magic is [[Categorization|categorised]] as independent from both [[religion]] and [[science]], due to its various beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Hutton|2012|p=x}}

Individuals who engage in magical practices are referred to as either magicians or witches.{{sfn|Hutton|2012|p=ix}} Although, connotations have varied from positive to negative at times throughout history,{{sfn|Bailey|2018|pp=1-5}} magic &quot;continues to have an important religious and medicinal role in many cultures today&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Baglari |first = M.H. |title = The Magic Art of Witchcraft and Black Magic |journal = International Journal of Scientific and Research |year =2015 |page = 20 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.736.7031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[Western culture]], magic has been linked to ideas of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]],{{sfnm|1a1=Bogdan|1y=2012|1p=2|2a1=Graham|2y=2018|2p=255}} foreignness,{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=89}} and primitivism;{{sfn|Davies|2012|p=1}} indicating that it is &quot;a powerful marker of cultural difference&quot;{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=14}} and likewise, a non-modern phenomenon.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=8}} During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Western intellectuals perceived the practice of magic to be a sign of a primitive mentality and also commonly attributed it to marginalised groups of people.{{sfn|Styers|2004|p=14}}

In modern [[occultism]] and [[Neopagan]] religions, many self-described magicians and witches regularly practice ritual magic;&lt;ref&gt;Berger, H.A., Ezzy, D., (2007), Teenage Witches, Rutgers University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt; defining magic as a technique for bringing about change in the physical world through the force of one's will. This definition was popularised by [[Aleister Crowley]] (1875-1947), an influential British occultist, and since that time other religions (e.g. [[Wicca]] and [[LaVeyan Satanism]]) and magical systems (e.g. [[chaos magic|Chaos Magic]]) have adopted it.

==Etymology==
[[File:Herodotos Met 91.8.jpg|150px|thumb|right|One of the earliest surviving accounts of the Persian ''mágoi'' was provided by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]]]

The English words [[:wikt:magic|magic]], [[:wikt:mage|mage]] and [[:wikt:magician|magician]] come from the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[:wikt:magus|magus]], through the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[:wikt:μάγος|μάγος]], which is from the [[Old Persian]] ''maguš''. ([[:wikt:𐎶𐎦𐎢𐏁|𐎶𐎦𐎢𐏁]], magician).{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2012|1p=169|2a1=Otto|2a2=Stausberg|2y=2013|2p=16}} The Old Persian ''magu-'' is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''[[wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/megʰ-|*magh]]'' (be able). The Persian term may have led to the [[Old Chinese|Old Sinitic]] ''*Mᵞag'' (mage or [[shaman]]).{{sfn|Mair|2015|p=47}} The Old Persian form seems to have permeated ancient [[Semitic languages]] as the [[Talmudic]] [[Hebrew]] ''magosh'', the [[Aramaic]] ''amgusha'' (&quot;magician&quot;), and the [[Chaldea]]n ''maghdim'' (&quot;wisdom and philosophy&quot;); from the first century BCE onwards, [[Syria]]n ''magusai'' gained notoriety as magicians and soothsayers.{{sfn|Mair|2015|p=36}}

During the late-sixth and early-fifth centuries BCE, this term found its way into [[ancient Greek]], where it was used with negative connotations to apply to rites that were regarded as fraudulent, unconventional, and dangerous.{{sfn|Otto|Stausberg|2013|p=16}} The [[Latin]] language adopted this meaning of the term in the first century BCE. Via Latin, the concept became incorporated into [[Christian theology]] during the first century CE. [[Early Christians]] associated magic with [[demons]], and thus regarded it as against Christian religion. This concept remained pervasive throughout the Middle Ages, when Christian authors categorised a diverse range of practices—such as enchantment, [[witchcraft]], [[incantation]]s, [[divination]], [[necromancy]], and [[astrology]]—under the label magic. In [[early modern Europe]], [[Protestantism|Protestants]] often claimed that [[Roman Catholicism]] was magic rather than religion, and as Christian Europeans began [[European colonial era|colonizing other parts of the world]] in the sixteenth century they labelled the non-Christian beliefs they encountered as magical. In that same period, Italian [[Humanism|humanists]] reinterpreted the term in a positive sense to express the idea of [[natural magic]]. Both negative and positive understandings of the term recurred in Western culture over the following centuries.

Since the nineteenth century, academics in various disciplines have employed the term magic but have defined it in different ways and used it in reference to different things. One approach, associated with the [[anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Edward Tylor]] (1832-1917) and [[James G. Frazer]] (1854-1941), uses the term to describe beliefs in [[sympathetic magic|hidden sympathies]] between objects that allow one to influence the other. Defined in this way, magic is portrayed as the opposite to science. An alternative approach, associated with the [[sociology|sociologists]] [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872-1950) and his uncle [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858-1917), employs the term to describe private rites and ceremonies and contrasts it with religion, which it defines as a communal and organised activity. By the 1990s many scholars were rejecting the term's utility for scholarship. They argued that the label drew arbitrary lines between similar beliefs and practices that were alternatively considered religious, and that it constituted [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] to apply the connotations of magic - rooted in Western and Christian history - to other cultures.

==White, gray and black magic==

White magic has traditionally been understood as the use of magic for selfless or helpful purposes, while black magic was used for selfish, harmful or evil purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=JL |title=Practice and perception of black magic among the Hittites |journal=Altorientalische Forschungen |date=2010 |volume=37 |issue=2 |doi=10.1524/aofo.2010.0015 |s2cid=162843793 |url=https://www.sprachwiss.uni-muenchen.de/ueber_uns/personen/lmu/miller/publ_miller/black_magic_2010.pdf |accessdate=15 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baglari |first1=MH |title=The Magic Art of Witchcraft and Black Magic |journal=International Journal of Scientific and Research |date=2015 |page=20 |citeseerx=10.1.1.736.7031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the [[left-hand path and right-hand path]] dichotomy, black magic is the malicious, left hand counterpart of the benevolent white magic. There is no consensus  as to what constitutes White, Gray or Black magic, as [[Phil Hine]] says, &quot;like many other aspects of occultism, what is termed to be 'black magic' depends very much on who is doing the defining.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5286-1|author=Jesper Aagaard Petersen|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray magic, also called neutral magic, is magic that is not performed for specifically beneficial reasons, but is also not focused towards completely hostile practices.&lt;ref&gt;Smoley, R. &amp; Kinney, J.

==High and low magic==
Historians and anthropologists have distinguished between practitioners who engage in high magic, and those who engage in low magic.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=40}} In this framework, high magic is seen as more complex, involving lengthy and detailed rituals as well as sophisticated, sometimes expensive, paraphernalia.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=40}} Low magic is associated with peasants and folklore&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, S., (2000), Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld, Berg, page 7. ISBN, 9781859734506&lt;/ref&gt; and with simpler rituals such as brief, spoken spells.{{sfn|Bailey|2018|p=40}} Greenwood writes that &quot;Since the Renaissance, high magic has been concerned with drawing down forces and energies from heaven&quot; and achieving unity with divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, S., (2000), Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld, Berg, page 6. ISBN, 9781859734506&lt;/ref&gt; High magic is usually performed indoors while witchcraft is often performed outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, S., (2000), Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld, Berg, page 89.

Magic was invoked in many kinds of rituals and medical formulae, and to counteract evil omens. Defensive or legitimate magic in Mesopotamia (''asiputu'' or ''masmassutu'' in the Akkadian language) were incantations and ritual practices intended to alter specific realities. The ancient [[Mesopotamia]]ns believed that magic was the only viable defense against [[demon]]s, [[Ghosts in Mesopotamian religions|ghosts]], and evil sorcerers.{{sfn|Sasson|1995|pp=1896–1898}} To defend themselves against the spirits of those they had wronged, they would leave offerings known as ''kispu'' in the person's tomb in hope of appeasing them.{{sfn|Sasson|1995|p=1897}} If that failed, they also sometimes took a figurine of the deceased and buried it in the ground, demanding for the gods to eradicate the spirit, or force it to leave the person alone.{{sfn|Sasson|1995|pp=1898–1898}}

The ancient Mesopotamians also used magic intending to protect themselves from evil sorcerers who might place curses on them.{{sfn|Sasson|1995|p=1898}} Black magic as a category didn't exist in ancient Mesopotamia, and a person legitimately using magic to defend themselves against illegitimate magic would use exactly the same techniques.{{sfn|Sasson|1995|p=1898}} The only major difference was the fact that curses were enacted in secret;{{sfn|Sasson|1995|p=1898}} whereas a defense against sorcery was conducted in the open, in front of an audience if possible.{{sfn|Sasson|1995|p=1898}} One ritual to punish a sorcerer was known as [[Maqlû]], or &quot;The Burning&quot;.{{sfn|Sasson|1995|p=1898}} The person viewed as being afflicted by witchcraft would create an effigy of the sorcerer and put it on trial at night.{{sfn|Sasson|1995|p=1898}} Then, once the nature of the sorcerer's crimes had been determined, the person would burn the effigy and thereby break the sorcerer's power over them.{{sfn|Sasson|1995|p=1898}}

=== Elhanan and Goliath ===
2 Samuel 21:19 tells how Goliath the [[Gittite]] was killed by &quot;[[Elhanan son of Jair|Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim]], the Bethlehemite.&quot; Scholars believe that the original killer of Goliath was Elhanan, and that the authors of the [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic history|Deutoronomic history]] changed the text to credit the victory to the more famous character, David.{{sfn|Halpern|2003|p=8}} The fourth-century BC [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles 20:5]] explains the second Goliath by saying that Elhanan &quot;slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath&quot;, constructing the name [[Lahmi]] from the last portion of the word &quot;Bethlehemite&quot; (&quot;''beit-ha’lahmi''&quot;), and the [[King James Bible]] adopted this into 2 Samuel 21:18–19, but the Hebrew text at Goliath’s name makes no mention of the word &quot;brother&quot;.{{sfn|Halpern|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tn8PG4XfuBAC&amp;pg=PA8 7–10]}}

=== Goliath and the Greeks ===
The armor described in 1 Samuel 17 appears typical of Greek armor of the sixth century BCE rather than of Philistines armor of the tenth century; narrative formulae such as the settlement of battle by [[single combat]] between champions has been thought characteristic of the [[Homeric epics]] (the ''[[Iliad]]'') rather than of the ancient Near East. The designation of Goliath as a {{lang|he|איש הביניים}}, &quot;man of the in-between&quot; (a longstanding difficulty in translating 1 Samuel 17) appears to be a borrowing from Greek &quot;man of the ''{{transl|grc|metaikhmion}}'' ({{lang|grc|μεταίχμιον}})&quot;, i.e. the space between two opposite army camps where [[Champion warfare|champion combat]] would take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://berlinarchaeology.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/yadin-goliaths-armor.pdf|author=Azzan Yadin|title=Goliath's Armor and the Israelite Collective Memory|journal=[[Vetus Testamentum]]|volume=LIV|issue=3|pages=373–95|date=2004}}&lt;br/&gt;– See also {{cite journal|author=[[Israel Finkelstein]]|title=The Philistines in the Bible: A Late Monarchic Perspective|journal=[[Journal for the Study of the Old Testament]]|volume=27|issue=131|page=67}}&lt;br/&gt;– For a brief online overview, see {{cite web|title=Yadin on &quot;David and Goliath&quot; in VT 54 (2004)|url= http://www.heardworld.com/higgaion/?p=398|work=Higgaion|author=Christopher Heard|date=28 Apr 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013211237/http://www.heardworld.com/higgaion/?p=398|archive-date=2007-10-13|url-status=usurped}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A story very similar to that of David and Goliath appears in the [[Iliad]], written circa 760–710&amp;nbsp;BCE, where the young [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] fights and conquers the giant Ereuthalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinkelsteinSilberman2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Israel Finkelstein|author2=Neil Asher Silberman|title=David and Solomon: In Search of the Bible's Sacred Kings and the Roots of the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hvq6JbIHBDEC&amp;pg=PA198|date=3 April 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-4363-6|pages=198–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book 7 ll.132–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Each giant wields a distinctive weapon—an iron club in Ereuthalion's case, a massive bronze spear in Goliath's; each giant, clad in armor, comes out of the enemy's massed array to challenge all the warriors in the opposing army; in each case the seasoned warriors are afraid, and the challenge is taken up by a stripling, the youngest in his family (Nestor is the twelfth son of [[Neleus]], David the seventh or eighth son of [[Jesse]]). In each case an older and more experienced father figure (Nestor's own father, David's patron Saul) tells the boy that he is too young and inexperienced, but in each case the young hero receives divine aid and the giant is left sprawling on the ground. Nestor, fighting on foot, then takes the chariot of his enemy, while David, on foot, takes the sword of Goliath. The enemy army then flees, the victors pursue and slaughter them and return with their bodies, and the boy-hero is acclaimed by the people.{{sfn|West|1997|pp=370, 376}}

===Goliath's name===
[[Tell es-Safi]], the biblical [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and traditional home of Goliath, has been the subject of extensive excavations by Israel's [[Bar-Ilan University]]. The archaeologists have established that this was one of the largest of the Philistine cities until destroyed in the ninth century BC, an event from which it never recovered. A [[Sherd|potsherd]] discovered at the site, and reliably dated to the tenth to mid-ninth centuries BC, is inscribed with the two names &quot;alwt&quot; and &quot;wlt&quot;. While the names are not directly connected with the biblical Goliath (&quot;glyt&quot;), they are etymologically related and demonstrate that the name fits with the context of late-tenth/early-ninth-century BC Philistine culture. The name &quot;Goliath&quot; itself is non-Semitic and has been linked with the [[Lydia]]n king [[Alyattes I|Alyattes]], which also fits the Philistine context of the biblical Goliath story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/02/16/comment-on-the-news-item-in-bar-on-the-goliath-inscription/ Tell es-Safi/Gath weblog] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080109230143/http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~maeira/Goliath/Goliath%20Inscription.html Bar-Ilan University]; For the editio princeps and an in-depth discussion of the inscription, see now: Maeir, A.M., Wimmer, S.J., Zukerman, A., and Demsky, A.

== Later traditions ==
=== Jewish ===
[[File:David and Goliath -1700s.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendition of Goliath's fall]] 
According to the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]] 42b) Goliath was a son of [[Orpah]], the sister-in-law of [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]], David's own great grandmother (Ruth → [[Obed (biblical figure)|Obed]] → [[Jesse]] → David). [[Ruth Rabbah]], a haggadic and homiletic interpretation of the [[Book of Ruth]], makes the blood-relationship even closer, considering Orpah and Ruth to have been full sisters. Orpah was said to have made a pretense of accompanying Ruth but after forty paces left her. Thereafter she led a dissolute life. According to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] Goliath was born by [[polyspermy]], and had about one hundred fathers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Yebamoth, 24b.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmud stresses Goliath's ungodliness: his taunts before the Israelites included the boast that it was he who had captured the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and brought it to the temple of [[Dagon]]; and his challenges to combat were made at morning and evening in order to disturb the Israelites in their prayers. His armour weighed 60 tons, according to rabbi [[Hanina]]; 120, according to rabbi [[Abba bar Kahana]]; and his sword, which became the sword of David, had marvellous powers. On his death it was found that his heart carried the image of Dagon, who thereby also came to a shameful downfall.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief overview of Talmudic traditions on Goliath, see [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=336&amp;letter=G Jewish Encyclopedia, &quot;Goliath&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pseudo-Philo]], believed to have been composed between 135&amp;nbsp;BC and 70&amp;nbsp;AD, David picks up seven stones and writes on them his father's name, his own name, and the name of God, one name per stone; then, speaking to Goliath, he says &quot;Hear this word before you die: were not the two woman from whom you and I were born, sisters? And your mother was Orpah and my mother Ruth&amp;nbsp;...&quot; After David strikes Goliath with the stone he runs to Goliath before he dies and Goliath says &quot;Hurry and kill me and rejoice.&quot; and David replies &quot;Before you die, open your eyes and see your slayer.&quot; Goliath sees an angel and tells David that it is not he who has killed him but the angel. Pseudo-Philo then goes on to say that the angel of the Lord changes David's appearance so that no one recognizes him, and thus Saul asks who he is.&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, James H. 1983. ''The Old Testament pseudepigrapha'' vol 2. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday. {{ISBN|0-385-18813-7}} p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
Goliath appears in chapter 2 of the [[Quran]] (2: 247–252), in the narrative of David and Saul's battle against the Philistines.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', G. Vajda, ''Djalut''&lt;/ref&gt; Called {{transl|ar|Jalut}} in Arabic ({{lang|ar|جالوت}}), Goliath's mention in the Quran is concise, although it remains a parallel to the account in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Muslim scholars have tried to trace Goliath's origins, most commonly with the [[Amalek]]ites.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;''Hughes Dictionary of Islam'', T.P. Hughes, ''Goliath''&lt;/ref&gt; Goliath, in early scholarly tradition, became a kind of byword or collective name for the oppressors of the [[Israelite]] nation before [[David]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Muslim tradition sees the battle with the Goliath as a prefiguration of [[Muhammad]]'s [[battle of Badr]], and sees Goliath as parallel to the enemies that Muhammad faced.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt;

==Adaptations==
[[File:Michelangelo, David and Goliath 02.jpg|thumb|upright|David and Goliath by [[Michelangelo]], on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]]]
American actor [[Ted Cassidy]] portrayed Goliath in the TV series ''Greatest Heroes of the Bible'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1095791/|title='Greatest Heroes of the Bible' David &amp; Goliath (TV episode 1978)|publisher=imdb|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian actor [[George Eastman (actor)|Luigi Montefiori]] portrayed this {{height|ft=9|in=0}}-tall giant in [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s 1985 live-action film ''[[King David (film)|King David]]'' as part of a flashback. This film includes the King of the Philistines saying, &quot;Goliath has challenged the Israelites six times and no one has responded.&quot; It is then on the seventh time that David meets his challenge.

The PBS series ''[[Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone]]'' featured Goliath in its first-season episode &quot;Little Big Dog&quot;.

Big Idea's popular ''[[VeggieTales]]'' episode was called &quot;[[Dave and the Giant Pickle]]&quot;, where [[Phil Vischer]] voiced Goliath.

In 1972, [[Toho]] and [[Tsuburaya Productions]] collaborated on a film called ''[[Daigoro vs. Goliath]]'', which follows the story relatively closely but recasts the main characters as ''[[kaiju]]''.

In 1975, Israeli band [[Poogy]] release a song called ''Golyat'' on the album [[Crowded in the Ear|''Tzafoof BaOzen'']], loosely and humorously based on the story.

[[Suzanne Vega]]'s song ''Rock In This Pocket (Song Of David)'' on the album [[99.9F°|''99.9°F'']] is based on the story.

In 2005, Lightstone Studios released a direct-to-DVD movie musical titled &quot;One Smooth Stone&quot;, which was later changed to &quot;David and Goliath&quot;. It is part of the [[Liken the scriptures|Liken the Scriptures]] (now just Liken) series of movie musicals on DVD based on scripture stories. [[Thurl Bailey]], a former NBA basketball player, was cast to play the part of Goliath in this film.

In 2009, [[NBC]] aired [[Kings (U.S. TV series)|Kings]] which has a narrative loosely based on the Biblical story of [[King David]], but set in a kingdom that culturally and technologically resembles the present-day United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/what-would-jesus-watch-82121|title=What Would Jesus Watch?|last=Alston|first=Joshua|date=16 July 2009|website=Newsweek|access-date=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The part of Goliath is portrayed by a tank, which David destroys with a shoulder fired rocket launcher.

Goliath was portrayed by [[Conan Stevens]] in the 2013 TV miniseries ''[[The Bible (TV miniseries)|The Bible]]''.

===Italian Goliath film series (1960–1964)===
The Italians used Goliath as an action superhero in a series of biblical adventure films ([[Peplum (film genre)|peplum]]s) in the early 1960s. He possessed amazing strength, and the films were similar in theme to their [[Hercules]] and [[Maciste]] movies. After the classic ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, the 1959 [[Steve Reeves]] film ''Terrore dei Barbari'' (''Terror of the Barbarians'') was retitled ''[[Goliath and the Barbarians]]'' in the United States, (after [[Joseph E. Levine]] claimed the sole right to the name of ''Hercules''); the film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not really related to each other. (The 1960 Italian film ''David and Goliath'' starring [[Orson Welles]] was not one of these, since that film was a straightforward adaptation of the Biblical story).

The four titles in the Italian ''Goliath'' series were as follows:
 
* ''Goliath contro i giganti''/''[[Goliath Against the Giants]]'' (1960) starring [[Brad Harris]]
* ''Goliath e la schiava ribelle''/''[[Goliath and the Rebel Slave]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Tyrant of Lydia vs. The Son of Hercules'') (1963) starring [[Gordon Scott]]
* ''Golia e il cavaliere mascherato''/''Goliath and the Masked Rider'' (a.k.a. ''[[Hercules and the Masked Rider]]'')  (1964) starring [[Alan Steel]]
* ''Golia alla conquista di Bagdad''/''Goliath at the Conquest of Baghdad'' (a.k.a. ''[[Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus]]'', 1964) starring [[Peter Lupus]]

The name Goliath was later inserted into the film titles of three other Italian muscle man movies that were retitled for distribution in the United States in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as Goliath films in Italy.

Both ''[[Goliath and the Vampires]]'' (1961) and ''[[Goliath and the Sins of Babylon]]'' (1963) actually featured the famed superhero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors did not feel the name Maciste had any meaning to American audiences. ''[[Goliath and the Dragon]]'' (1960) was originally an Italian Hercules film called ''The Revenge of Hercules''.

=={{anchor|David and Goliath}} Modern usage of &quot;David and Goliath&quot;==
{{redirect|David and Goliath}}
In modern usage, the phrase &quot;David and Goliath&quot; has taken on a secular meaning, denoting an [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary; if successful, the underdog may win in an unusual or surprising way.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;macmillan&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/david-and-goliath | title=David and Goliath | encyclopedia=Macmillan Dictionary | accessdate=11 February 2015}} &quot;used for describing a situation in which a small person or organization defeats a much larger one in a surprising way&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is arguably the most famous underdog story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/passages/main-articles/david-and-goliath.aspx | title=David and Goliath (1 Sam 17) | publisher=Society of Biblical Literature | accessdate=18 February 2015 | author=[[Keith Bodner|Bodner, Keith]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theology]] professor Leonard Greenspoon, in his essay, &quot;David vs. Goliath in the Sports Pages&quot;, explains that &quot;most writers use the story for its underdog overtones (the little guy wins) ... Less likely to show up in newsprint is the contrast that was most important to the biblical authors: David's victory shows the power of his God, while Goliath's defeat reveals the weakness of the Philistine deities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/passages/related-articles/david-versus-goliath-in-the-sports-pages.aspx | title=David vs. Goliath in the Sports Pages | publisher=Society of Biblical Literature | accessdate=12 February 2015 | author=Greenspoon, Leonard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is widely used in news media to succinctly characterize underdog situations in many contexts without religious overtones. Contemporary headlines include: sports (&quot;Haye relishes underdog role in 'David and Goliath' fight with Nikolai Valuev&quot;—''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/03/david-haye-nikolai-valuev-donald-mcrae | title=Haye relishes underdog role in 'David and Goliath' fight with Nikolai Valuev | work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London | date=3 November 2009 | accessdate=3 November 2009 | author=McRae, Donald}} Smaller boxer battles gigantic WBA world heavyweight champion.&lt;/ref&gt;); business (&quot;On Internet, David-and-Goliath Battle Over Instant Messages&quot;—''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/nyregion/on-internet-david-and-goliath-battle-over-instant-messages.html | title=On Internet, David-and-Goliath Battle Over Instant Messages | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=24 June 2000 | accessdate=27 March 2015 | author=Blair, Jayson}} Tiny online start-up battles Internet giant.&lt;/ref&gt;); science (&quot;David and Goliath: How a tiny spider catches much larger prey&quot;—''[[ScienceDaily]]'';&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencedaily&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/06/140612095035.htm | title=David and Goliath: How a tiny spider catches much larger prey | website=ScienceDaily | date=12 June 2014 | accessdate=10 February 2016}} Tiny spider preys on ants up to almost four times its size.&lt;/ref&gt; politics (&quot;Dissent in Cuba: David and Goliath&quot;—''[[The Economist]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.economist.com/node/1537865 | title=Dissent in Cuba: David and Goliath | work=[[The Economist]] | date=16 January 2003 | accessdate=27 March 2015}} &quot;A one-party election faces a small but unprecedented challenge.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;); social justice (&quot;David-and-Goliath Saga Brings Cable to Skid Row&quot;—''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/21/news/mn-6603 | title=David-and-Goliath Saga Brings Cable to Skid Row | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=21 November 2001 | accessdate=27 March 2015 | author=Rivera, Carla}} Skid row resident battles telecoms giant to win cable access.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Aside from the above allegorical use of &quot;David and Goliath&quot;, there is also the use of &quot;Goliath&quot; for a particularly tall person. For example, basketball player [[Wilt Chamberlain]] was nicknamed &quot;Goliath&quot;, which he disliked.

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where
:{{mvar|e}} is [[E (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]], the base of [[natural logarithm]]s,
:{{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]], which by definition satisfies {{math|''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −1}}, and
:{{mvar|&amp;pi;}} is [[pi]], the [[ratio]] of the circumference of a [[circle]] to its diameter.
Euler's identity is named after the Swiss mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]]. It is considered to be an exemplar of [[mathematical beauty]] as it shows a profound connection between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics.

==Mathematical beauty==
Euler's identity is often cited as an example of deep [[mathematical beauty]].&lt;ref name=Gallagher2014&gt;{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=James |title=Mathematics: Why the brain sees maths as beauty |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26151062 |accessdate=26 December 2017 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the basic [[arithmetic]] operations occur exactly once each: [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]]. The identity also links five fundamental [[mathematical constant]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Paulos, 1992, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[0|number 0]], the [[additive identity]].
* The [[1|number 1]], the [[multiplicative identity]].
* The [[pi|number {{mvar|&amp;pi;}}]] ({{mvar|&amp;pi;}} = 3.141...), the fundamental [[circle]] constant.
* The [[e (mathematical constant)|number {{math|''e''}}]] ({{math|''e''}} = 2.718...), a.k.a. Euler's number, which occurs widely in [[mathematical analysis]].
* The [[imaginary unit|number {{math|''i''}}]], the imaginary unit of the [[complex number]]s.

Furthermore, the equation is given in the form of an expression set equal to zero, which is common practice in several areas of mathematics.

[[Stanford University]] mathematics professor [[Keith Devlin]] has said, &quot;like a Shakespearean [[sonnet]] that captures the very essence of love, or a painting that brings out the beauty of the human form that is far more than just skin deep, Euler's equation reaches down into the very depths of existence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nahin, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GvSg5HQ7WPcC&amp;pg=PA1 p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Paul Nahin]], a professor emeritus at the [[University of New Hampshire]], who has written a book dedicated to [[Euler's formula]] and its applications in [[Fourier analysis]], describes Euler's identity as being &quot;of exquisite beauty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nahin, 2006, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics writer [[Constance Reid]] has opined that Euler's identity is &quot;the most famous formula in all mathematics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, chapter ''e''.&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Benjamin Peirce]], a 19th-century American [[philosopher]], mathematician, and professor at [[Harvard University]], after proving Euler's identity during a lecture, stated that the identity &quot;is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don't know what it means, but we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Maor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eIsyLD_bDKkC&amp;pg=PA160 p. 160], and Kasner &amp; Newman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ad8hAx-6m9oC&amp;pg=PA103 p. 103–104].&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll of readers conducted by ''[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' in 1990 named Euler's identity as the &quot;most beautiful [[theorem]] in mathematics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In another poll of readers that was conducted by ''[[Physics World]]'' in 2004, Euler's identity tied with [[Maxwell's equations]] (of [[electromagnetism]]) as the &quot;greatest equation ever&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crease, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the brains of sixteen mathematicians found that the &quot;emotional brain&quot; (specifically, the medial [[orbitofrontal cortex]], which lights up for beautiful music, poetry, pictures, etc.) lit up more consistently for Euler's identity than for any other formula.&lt;ref&gt;Zeki et al., 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three books in [[popular mathematics]] have been published about Euler's identity:

[[File:ExpIPi.gif|thumb|right|In this animation {{mvar|N}} takes various increasing values from 1 to 100. The computation of {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''iπ''|''N''}})&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is displayed as the combined effect of {{mvar|N}} repeated multiplications in the [[complex plane]], with the final point being the actual value of {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''iπ''|''N''}})&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. It can be seen that as {{mvar|N}} gets larger {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''iπ''|''N''}})&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} approaches a limit of −1.]]
Fundamentally, Euler's identity asserts that &lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to −1. The expression &lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi}&lt;/math&gt; is a special case of the expression &lt;math&gt;e^z&lt;/math&gt;, where {{math|''z''}} is any complex number. In general, &lt;math&gt;e^z&lt;/math&gt; is defined for complex {{math|''z''}} by extending one of the [[characterizations of the exponential function|definitions of the exponential function]] from real exponents to complex exponents. For example, one common definition is:

:&lt;math&gt;e^z = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1+\frac z n \right)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Euler's identity therefore states that the limit, as {{math|''n''}} approaches infinity, of &lt;math&gt;(1 + i\pi/n)^n&lt;/math&gt; is equal to −1. This limit is illustrated in the animation to the right.

[[File:Euler's formula.svg|thumb|right|Euler's formula for a general angle]]
Euler's identity is a [[special case]] of [[Euler's formula]], which states that for any [[real number]] {{math|''x''}},

: &lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x&lt;/math&gt;

where the inputs of the [[trigonometry|trigonometric functions]] sine and cosine are given in [[radian]]s.

In particular, when {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''π''}},

: &lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} = \cos \pi + i\sin \pi.&lt;/math&gt;

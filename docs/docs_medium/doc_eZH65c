The parameters can be used by the drawing functions, and also by the production rules. The production rules can use the parameters in two ways: first, in a conditional statement determining whether the rule will apply, and second, the production rule can modify the actual parameters. For example, look at:

:a(x,y) : x == 0 → a(1, y+1)b(2,3)

The module a(x,y) undergoes transformation under this production rule if the conditional x=0 is met. For example, a(0,2) would undergo transformation, and a(1,2) would not.

In the transformation portion of the production rule, the parameters as well as entire modules can be affected. In the above example, the module b(x,y) is added to the string, with initial parameters (2,3). Also, the parameters of the already existing module are transformed. Under the above production rule,

:a(0,2)

Becomes

:a(1,3)b(2,3)

as the &quot;x&quot; parameter of a(x,y) is explicitly transformed to a &quot;1&quot; and the &quot;y&quot; parameter of a is incremented by one.

Parametric grammars allow line lengths and branching angles to be determined by the grammar, rather than the turtle interpretation methods. Also, if age is given as a parameter for a module, rules can change depending on the age of a plant segment, allowing animations of the entire life-cycle of the tree to be created.

===Bi-directional grammars===
The bi-directional model explicitly separates the symbolic rewriting system from the shape assignment. For example, the string rewriting process in the Example 2 (Fractal tree) is independent on how graphical operations are assigned to the symbols. In other words, an infinite number of draw methods are applicable to a given rewriting system.

The bi-directional model consists of 1) a forward process constructs the derivation tree with production rules, and 2) a backward process realizes the tree with shapes in a stepwise manner (from leaves to the root). Each inverse-derivation step involves essential geometric-topological reasoning. With this bi-directional framework, design constraints and objectives are encoded in the grammar-shape translation. In architectural design applications, the bi-directional grammar features consistent interior connectivity and a rich spatial hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Hua, H., 2017, December.

== Open problems ==
There are many open problems involving studies of L-systems. For example:

* Characterisation of all the deterministic context-free L-systems which are [[locally catenative sequence|locally catenative]]. (A complete solution is known only in the case where there are only two variables).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-59136-5_5|chapter = L Systems|title = Handbook of Formal Languages| pages=253–328|year = 1997|last1 = Kari|first1 = Lila| last2=Rozenberg| first2=Grzegorz| last3=Salomaa| first3=Arto| isbn=978-3-642-63863-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Given a structure, find an L-system that can produce that structure.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Types of L-systems ==
L-systems on the [[real number|real line]] '''R''':
*[[Prouhet-Thue-Morse system]]

Well-known L-systems on a plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are:

'''Bread pudding''' is a bread-based [[dessert]] popular in many countries' cuisines, made with [[staling|stale]] [[bread]] and [[milk]] or [[cream]], generally containing [[egg (food)|eggs]], a form of fat such as [[oil]], [[butter]] or [[suet]], and depending on whether the pudding is sweet or savory, a variety of other ingredients. Sweet bread puddings may use [[sugar]], [[syrup]], [[honey]], [[dried fruit]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], as well as spices such as [[cinnamon]], [[nutmeg]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], or [[vanilla]]. The bread is soaked in the liquids, mixed with the other ingredients, and baked.

Savory puddings may be served as main courses, while sweet puddings are typically eaten as desserts.

In other languages, its name is a translation of &quot;bread pudding&quot; or even just &quot;pudding&quot;, for example &quot;pudín&quot; or &quot;budín&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFMenta2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFGuerra2014&quot; /&gt; In the Philippines, banana bread pudding is popular.

==History==

The 18th-century [[English cuisine|English]] cookbook ''[[The Compleat Housewife]]'' contains two recipes for baked bread pudding. The first is identified as &quot;A Bread and Butter Pudding for Fasting Days&quot;. To make the pudding a baking dish is lined with [[puff pastry]], and slices of penny loaf with butter, raisins and currants, and pieces of butter are added in alternating layers. Over this is poured thickened, spiced cream and [[orange blossom water]], and the dish is baked in the oven. There is another version of the dish that is simpler, omitting the spices and dried fruits.

Bread pudding was one of the dishes that Rhode Island army officers ate for their [[Fourth of July]] celebrations during the [[Siege of Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What do Americans eat on July 4th? |url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/july4th.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional variations ==

In [[Belgium]], particularly [[Brussels]], it is baked with brown sugar, cinnamon, old bread, and raisins or apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waerebeek|first1=Ruth|last2=Robbins|first2=Maria|title=Everybody eats well in Belgium cookbook: 250 Recipes from a Rich Culinary Tradition|date=1996|publisher=Workman Pub.|location=New York|isbn=9781563054112|pages=294–95|url=https://www.eatyourbooks.com/library/recipes/765515/belgian-bread-pudding-broodpudding-|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], bread pudding is sometimes made with [[maple syrup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/recipes/maple-bread-pudding/article649820/|title=Maple bread pudding|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hong Kong]], bread pudding is usually served with vanilla cream dressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hémard|first=Ned|url=https://www.neworleansbar.org/uploads/files/Bread%20Pudding%2010_9_13%281%29.pdf|title=NO REAL FRENCH WORD for Pudding|year=2013|work=New Orleans Nostalgia|publisher=New Orleans Bar Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hungary]], it is called 'Máglyarakás' which is baked with whipped egg whites on top of it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In [[Malaysia]], bread pudding is eaten with [[custard]] sauce.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Germany]], black bread is used to make &quot;black bread pudding&quot; (''Schwarzbrotpudding'').{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In [[Puerto Rico]], bread pudding is soaked over night in coconut milk and served with a [[guava]] rum sauce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/165102/budin-puerto-rican-bread-pudding/?lnkid=pin10822&amp;crlt.pid=camp.UhW9ynnXmkcb|title=Budin (Puerto Rican Bread Pudding) Recipe|work=Allrecipes|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raisins and sweet plantains are also added.

In the [[United States]], especially [[Louisiana]], bread puddings are typically sweet and served as dessert with a sweet sauce of some sort, such as [[whiskey]] sauce, [[rum]] sauce, or [[caramel]] sauce, but typically sprinkled with sugar and eaten warm in squares or slices. Sometimes, bread pudding is served warm topped with or alongside a dollop of [[whipped cream]] or a scoop of [[vanilla ice cream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Orleans cuisine : fourteen signature dishes and their histories|date=2009|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|others=Tucker, Susan, 1950-|isbn=9781604736458|location=Jackson|oclc=690209593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Batavia''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|t|eɪ|v|i|ə}}; {{Lang-nl|Betuwe}}, {{IPA-nl|ˈbeːtyʋə|lang|Nl-Betuwe.ogg}}) is a historical and geographical region in the [[Netherlands]], forming large fertile islands in the [[Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta|river delta]] formed by the waters of the [[Rhine]] (Dutch: ''Rijn'') and [[Meuse]] (Dutch: ''Maas'') rivers. During the [[Roman empire]], it was an important frontier region and source of imperial soldiers. Its name is possibly pre-Roman.

Administratively, the modern version, Betuwe, is a part of the modern province of [[Gelderland]] and although the rivers and provinces have changed over history it is roughly the same. Today it has the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] river on the south and the [[Lek (river)|Lek]] and [[Nederrijn]] in the north (all rivers which start in the delta itself and are branches of the Rhine or Maas. Historically, the former municipality of [[Rijnwaarden]] belonged to Betuwe, now in [[Zevenaar]], which was cut off by the building of the [[Pannerdens Kanaal]].

A major freight railroad, the [[Betuweroute]], passes through the Betuwe. It was opened in 2007 after many years of controversy.

The Betuwe region is divided into 9 [[municipality|municipalities]]: [[Lingewaard]], [[Arnhem]] (southern part), [[Nijmegen]] (northern part), [[Overbetuwe]], [[Neder-Betuwe]], [[Buren]], [[Tiel]], [[Culemborg]] and [[West Betuwe]].

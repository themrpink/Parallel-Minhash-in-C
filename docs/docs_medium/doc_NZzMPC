A '''British [[sitcom]]''' or a '''Britcom''' is a situation comedy programme produced for [[Television in the United Kingdom|British television]]. Although styles of sitcom have changed over the years they tend to be based on a family, workplace or other institution, where the same group of contrasting characters is brought together in each [[episode]]. British sitcoms are typically produced in one or more series of six episodes. Most such series are conceived and developed by one or two writers.

The majority of British sitcoms are 30 minutes long and are recorded on studio sets in a [[multiple-camera setup]]. A subset of British comedy consciously avoids traditional situation comedy themes and storylines to branch out into more unusual topics or narrative methods. ''[[Blackadder]]'' (1983–1989) and ''[[Yes Minister]]'' (1980–1988, 2013) moved what is often a domestic or workplace genre into the corridors of power. A later development was the [[mockumentary]] in such series as ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' (2001–2003).

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The first British television sitcom was ''[[Pinwright's Progress]]'', broadcast by the BBC from 1946 to 1947,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/pinwrights_progress/ &quot;Pinwright's Progress&quot;], British Comedy Guide website&lt;/ref&gt; but the form did not take off until the transfer of ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'' from [[BBC]] radio in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Clark [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/482549/index.html &quot;Hancock's Half Hour (1956-60)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Hancock|Hancock]] biographer John Fisher dates the first use of the term 'situation comedy' in British broadcasting to a BBC memo dated 31 March 1953 written by producer [[Peter Eton]], suggesting the format as the ideal vehicle for Hancock's comedic style.&lt;ref&gt;John Fisher ''Tony Hancock. The Definitive Biography'', London: Harper Collins, 2008, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Hancock's persona of the pompous loser out of his depth in an uncomprehending society still informs many programmes today&quot;, according to Phil Wickham.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Wickham [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/445368/ &quot;Sitcom&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the scripts written for Hancock by [[Galton and Simpson|Ray Galton]] and [[Galton and Simpson|Alan Simpson]] almost repudiated a narrative structure altogether and attempted to reproduce an everyday environment with the intention of also reproducing its comedy. ITV's most successful sitcom of this period was probably ''[[The Army Game]]'' (1957–1961),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/armygame.htm &quot;The Army Game&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709092240/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/armygame.htm |date=9 July 2009 }}, Television Heaven website&lt;/ref&gt; featuring some of the comedians who would soon appear in the ''[[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]]'' film series.

In the 1960s the BBC produced the earliest of [[Richard Waring (writer)|Richard Waring]]'s domestic comedies, ''[[Marriage Lines]]'' (1961–1966), with [[Richard Briers]] and [[Prunella Scales]] and a then-rare workplace&lt;ref&gt;John Oliver [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/572407/index.html &quot;Chesney, Ronald (1920-) and Wolfe, Ronald (1924-)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; comedy with ''[[The Rag Trade]]'' (1961–1963, 1977–1978). Two long-running series began around this time, ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' (1962–1965, 1970–1974) and ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'' (1965–1968, 1972–1975), the latter criticised by Clean-Up TV campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] for its bad language.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mary-whitehouse-to-some-a-crank-to-others-a-warrior-617910.html &quot;Mary Whitehouse: To some a crank, to others a warrior: Mary Whitehouse On&quot;], ''The Independent'', 24 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt; With ''Steptoe'' (and ''[[The Likely Lads]]'', 1964–1966) producers began to cast straight actors, rather than comedians,&lt;ref&gt;John Oliver [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/467108/index.html &quot;Galton, Ray (1930-) and Simpson, Alan (1929-)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; around whom earlier series like ''[[Whack-O!]]'' (1956–1960, 1971–1972), with [[Jimmy Edwards]], or those featuring Hancock, had been built.

A gentle mockery of Britain's 'finest hour' occurred with the home guard comedy ''[[Dad's Army]]'' (1968–1977) and the church with ''[[All Gas and Gaiters]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/allgasandgaiters/ &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot;], BBC Comedy website&lt;/ref&gt; (1966–1971). Women generally had very secondary roles at this time, though various series with [[Wendy Craig]] in the leading role and those developed by scriptwriter [[Carla Lane]], the first successful female writer in the form,&lt;ref&gt;Julia Hallam [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/975584/index.html &quot;Lane, Carla (1937-)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; were challenges to this situation. Lane's career initially began in collaboration with other writers on ''[[The Liver Birds]]'' (1969–1979, 1996).

=== The 1970s ===

The 1970s is often regarded as the golden era of British sitcom. Well-remembered series include [[John Cleese]] and [[Connie Booth]]'s farcical ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' (1975, 1979), [[Esmonde and Larbey|John Esmonde]] and [[Esmonde and Larbey|Bob Larbey]]'s self-sufficiency comedy ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' (1975–78). ''[[Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?]]'' (1973–74), a sequel to the earlier show, surpassed the original, while the same writers ([[Dick Clement]] and [[Ian La Frenais]]) provided [[Ronnie Barker]] with his most successful sitcom vehicle, ''[[Porridge (1974 TV series)|Porridge]]'' (1974–77). Barker also starred (along with [[David Jason]]) in ''[[Open All Hours]]'' (1973, 1976–85), written by [[Roy Clarke]]. Clarke's long-running ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'' began in 1973 and ended in 2010, becoming the world's longest running sitcom.

The commercial station [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] had popular successes with ''[[Rising Damp]]'' (1974–78, sometimes called the best of all ITV sitcoms),&lt;ref&gt;Phil Wickham [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/579131/index.html &quot;Rising Damp (1974–78)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Man About the House]]'' (1973–76) and ''[[George and Mildred]]'' (1976–79). ''Rising Damp'' star [[Leonard Rossiter]] also played the lead role in the BBC's highly popular ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'' (1976–79). The decline in cinema attendance in this period meant that many of these series were turned into cinema films;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Coniam [http://www.bodnotbod.org.uk/kettering/Kettering1.pdf &quot;A Users Guide to the Great British Sitcom Movie&quot;], ''Kettering: The Fanzine of Elderly British Comedy'', [n.d., c.2003] No.1, p.3-9&lt;/ref&gt; the [[On the Buses (film)|first film]] version of ''[[On the Buses]]'' (1969–73) was the biggest hit at the British box office in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/buses.htm &quot;On the Buses&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629122247/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/buses.htm |date=29 June 2011 }}, Television Heaven website&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jeff Evans]], ''On the Buses'' is a &quot;cheerfully vulgar comedy&quot; in which &quot;leering and innuendo dominate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Evans ''The Penguin TV Companion'', London: Penguin, 2006, p.621&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the network's other ratings successes from this era are now considered politically incorrect. Series such as ''[[Love Thy Neighbour (1972 TV series)|Love Thy Neighbour]]'' (1972–76)&lt;ref&gt;Vic Pratt [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/501026/index.html &quot;Love Thy Neighbour (1972–76)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mind Your Language]]'' (1977–79, 1986),&lt;ref&gt;Vic Pratt [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1108213/index.html &quot;Mind Your Language (1977–79, 1986)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; which attempted to find humour in racial or ethnic conflict and misunderstandings, were increasingly criticised over time.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1108234/index.html &quot;Race and the Sitcom&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing relaxation in regard to the discussion of sex meant [[farce]] became a familiar form in the 1970s used in series like ''[[Up Pompeii!]]'' (1969–70, 1975, 1991),&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Clark [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/783908/ &quot;Up Pompeii! (1970)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' (1972, 1973–85).&lt;ref&gt;Phil Wickham [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/579093/index.html &quot;Are You Being Served? (1972, 1973–85)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 1980s ===

In the 1980s the emerging [[Alternative comedy|alternative comedians]] began to encroach on British sitcoms, partly as a response to such series as ''[[Terry and June]]'' (1979–87) being perceived as containing &quot;complacent gentility, outmoded social attitudes and bourgeois sensibilities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Coniam [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/579057/index.html &quot;Terry and June (1979-87)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; The alternatives incursion began with ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' (1982–84), written by [[Rik Mayall]], [[Ben Elton]] and others, and continued with ''[[Blackadder]]'' (1983–89). Mayall was also the star of ''[[The New Statesman]]'' (1987–92), a series created by [[Maurice Gran]] and [[Laurence Marks (British writer)|Laurence Marks]], whose biggest success, ''[[Birds of a Feather]]'' (1989–98, 2014–), also deviated from British practice in being scripted by a team of writers.

''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', one of the most successful of all British sitcoms, began in 1981 and was the most durable of several series written and created by [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]]. Other hits included the political [[satire]] ''[[Yes Minister]]'' (1980–84) and its sequel ''Yes, Prime Minister'' (1986–88), Esmonde and Larbey's suburban sitcom ''[[Ever Decreasing Circles]]'' (1984–89) and the [[sci-fi]]-comedy ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' (1988–). Other shows such as ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'' (1984–92) were reminiscent of 1970s sitcoms such as ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' and ''[[Dad's Army]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Hamad [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1114934/index.html &quot;'Allo 'Allo (1984-92)&quot;!], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; unsurprising in light of the fact that all three involved the writer/producer [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] and two were co-written by [[Jeremy Lloyd]]. Also worth mentioning is the short lived Roman Britain sitcom ''[[Chelmsford 123]]'' (1988–1990) which has fallen into relative obscurity.

=== The 1990s ===
The new [[Channel 4]] began to have successful long-running situation comedies. ''[[Desmond's]]'' (1989–94) was the first British sitcom with a black cast set in the workplace,&lt;ref&gt;Ali Jaafar [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/490845/index.html &quot;Desmond's (1988-94)&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Drop the Dead Donkey]]'' (1990–98) brought topicality to the form as it was recorded close to transmission.

Some of the biggest hits of the 1990s were ''[[Father Ted]]'', ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]'', ''[[Game On (UK TV series)|Game On]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'', ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'', ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]'', ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'', ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]'', ''[[The Brittas Empire]]'', ''[[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|The Thin Blue Line]]'', ''[[Mr. Bean]]'', ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'' and ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''. ([[BBC Worldwide]] confirmed in February 2016 that ''Keeping Up Appearances'' is the corporation's most exported television programme, being sold nearly 1,000 times to overseas broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/bbcs-most-popular-show-overseas-is-keeping-up-appearances-a6880806.html|title=BBC's most popular show overseas is...Keeping Up Appearances |newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=18 February 2016|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

A final David Croft sitcom, ''[[Oh, Doctor Beeching]]'' aired from 1995 until 1997.

=== Since 2000 ===
Around the Millennium period and onward into the 2000s examples of the [[hyperreality|hyperreal]] approach pioneered by Galton and Simpson in some of their Hancock scripts, and ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'', appeared in sitcoms like ''[[The Royle Family]]'', ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', ''[[Early Doors]]'', and ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'', as well as many British [[dramedy|dramedies]].

The BBC has also begun using their digital channels [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] and [[BBC Four]] to build a following for off-beat series including ''[[The Thick of It]]''. Channel 4 has had successes with ''[[Spaced]]'', ''[[Black Books]]'', ''[[Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights|Phoenix Nights]]'', ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'', ''[[Green Wing]]'', ''[[The IT Crowd]]'', ''[[The Inbetweeners]]'', ''[[Friday Night Dinner]]'' and ''[[Derry Girls]]''.

The conventional sitcom has declined in importance in the schedules over time (in many cases superseded by the mixture of comedy and drama in [[dramedy]] series such as ''[[Doc Martin]]'' and ''[[Hamish Macbeth (TV series)|Hamish Macbeth]]'') although the form is not extinct. Some popular sitcoms in the UK during the last ten years include ''[[Outnumbered (UK TV series)|Outnumbered]]''; ''[[Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps]]'', which ended its ninth series in 2011; and ''[[The IT Crowd]]'' (2006–2013).

At the BBC, the late 2000s and early 2010s saw a major resurgence in traditional-style sitcoms filmed in front of a studio audience and featuring a laughter track, such as ''[[Not Going Out]]'', ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]]'', ''[[Reggie Perrin]]'' (a remake of the 1970s series ''The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin''), ''[[Big Top (2009 TV series)|Big Top]]'', ''[[Mrs Brown's Boys]] ''and ''[[In with the Flynns]]''.

ITV also revisited sitcoms upon their rebranding in 2013. Birds of a Feather returned with another series over a decade after its conclusion and received critical acclaim. Focus on sitcoms has since been redirected to a channel that is part of the ITV network - [[ITV2]], which airs American sitcoms.

== British sitcoms overseas ==

=== United States ===
British sitcoms are often seen on the [[Public Broadcasting Service]], usually thanks to the effort of [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] and increasingly on cable television, including [[BBC America]] and [[Comedy Central]]. ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'', ''[[Keeping up Appearances]]'' and ''[[As Time Goes By (UK TV series)|As Time Goes By]]'' became sleeper hits when they aired on the Public Broadcasting Service, while ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' enjoyed a significant following when it aired on Comedy Central and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' won a [[Golden Globe]] award in 2004 for &quot;Best Television Series—Musical or Comedy&quot;, beating popular American favourites such as ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. Most PBS stations affectionately refer to British sitcoms as &quot;Britcoms&quot;.

Several British sitcoms have been successfully [[List of American television series based on British television series|remade for the American market]]. Notable examples include ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' which became ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', ''[[Till Death Us Do Part (British TV series)|Till Death Us Do Part]]'', which became ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' which was remade into an [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|American series]] of the same name. [[Three's Company]], a remake of [[Man About the House]], spawned identical spinoffs: [[The Ropers]] ([[George and Mildred]]) and [[Three's a Crowd]] ([[Robin's Nest]]). Other American remakes of British sitcoms include [[The Rear Guard]] which was based on [[Dad's Army]], and [[What a Country!]] which was based on [[Mind Your Language]]. More recently, shows such as ''[[The Inbetweeners]]'' have been adapted, as well as ''[[Misfits (TV series)|Misfits]]'' and ''The Thick of It'' as ''[[Veep]]''. A large number of US adaptations end up being cancelled early or are not commissioned after their pilots are created. Another notable difference, which has been both positive and negative depending upon the skill of the cast and writers, is the American media culture of 20+ episode seasons as opposed to the British which usually has fewer than 10 episodes per series.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
In Australia, many British comedy series are aired on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], which is the Australian equivalent of the BBC. British shows are also sometimes shown on the three commercial [[television network]]s in Australia; in particular [[Network Seven]] screened many popular UK sitcoms during the 1970s. In New Zealand, state-run [[Television New Zealand]] also broadcast many popular British series. The majority of British comedies now air in both countries on the subscription channels [[The Comedy Channel]] and [[UKTV]].

Australian commercial television channels made their own versions of popular British comedies during the 1970s often using members of the original casts. These included: ''[[Are You Being Served? (Australian TV series)|Are You Being Served?]]'', ''[[Father, Dear Father]]'', ''[[Doctor Down Under]]'', ''[[Love Thy Neighbour (1972 TV series)|Love Thy Neighbour]]''. In both countries, locally written and made sitcoms have historically often been heavily influenced by the structure of British sitcoms (such as in the New Zealand sitcom ''[[Gliding On]]'').

=== India ===
In the 1980s, India's national stations [[Doordarshan]] showed ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Yes, Minister]]'' and ''[[Mind Your Language]]''.

After learning to play drums, piano and guitar, his musical career took off at the age of 18, he has worked continuously since that time for a wide range of bands and artists. After leaving school in 1969 he	joined Black Velvet, a soul/funk band – tours, recording and radio shows. A year later, he toured with the [[Elgins]]. Then in 1971, he joined CBS band Heaven and supported [[Jeff Beck]] on tour in the UK and Germany.

In June 1972, he began working for [[Gary Glitter]]'s backing band The Glittermen and, in the same month, they made their first appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with &quot;Rock and Roll Part 2&quot;.
The Glittermen were renamed [[The Glitter Band]] and established a separate identity consisting of a six-member lineup Gerry Shephard (lead guitar/lead vocals), John Springate (bass/lead vocals ), Pete Phipps (drums and keyboards), Tony Leonard (drums), John Rossall (trombone) Harvey Ellison (saxophone). Tours with Gary Glitter continued.

In December 1975, their third album ''Listen to the Band'', saw Phipps for the first time on lead vocals on the self-penned &quot;My First Mistake&quot;. In 1977, their fourth album, ''Paris Match'' was recorded  in France, plus an EP featuring &quot;She was Alright&quot; (written by Phipps) as the A side.

Changing direction, Phipps first joined Ex-Directory a jazz rock band where he first met Vic Martin (who would later, with Pete, join the Eurythmics); this was then followed by a short period with a London based punk rock band called The Secret.  Phipps was then asked to join [[Random Hold]], a band he had already worked with a year or two before.  Random Hold composed of [[David Rhodes (guitarist)|David Rhodes]], [[Bill MacCormick]], David Ferguson, and Pete Phipps were described by a music journalist{{who |date=April 2017}} as &quot;disco orientated rock&quot;, and by [[Nina Myskow]] in ''The Sun'' as a band to watch for as &quot;Their music shows talent, menace, originality and brains. A dynamic combination&quot;.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The band produced several singles in this period including &quot;Montgomery Clift&quot; and albums ''The View From Here'' (1980) and ''Burn the Buildings'' (1981). Phipps also continued to record with Glitter Band colleagues pursuing solo identities, such as with John Springate recording an album together in John's own Rock Star Studio and playing drums on the album ''Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is'', by Gerry Shephard and [[Peter Oxendale]].

In 1982, Phipps was invited by [[Mike Rutherford]] to record the album ''[[Acting Very Strange]]'',  and later in the same year was invited by [[XTC]] to record with them on their ''[[Mummer]]'' album.

Through 1983 and 1984 he was a member of [[The Eurythmics]]. His first outing with the Eurythmics was recorded at Heaven for MTV and later released as the video ''Sweet Dreams'' (1985).  He toured in the US and in the UK. Also in 1984, Phipps returned to work with XTC in the studio to record the album ''Big Express''.

In 1985, Phipps recorded with [[Hugh Cornwell]] playing on the single &quot;One in a Million&quot;. He then rejoined Gary Glitter for UK, Middle East and US tours. He also restarted Glitter Band gigs, joining with some of the other original members, and has remained part of the Glitter Band with a number of different line-ups to the present day.

In 1986, Phipps performed on ''Zipper'' an album written by [[Roger Chapman]]. In 1987 he toured as a replacement in [[Culture Club]] in France and Iceland. The next year, Phipps played with the Legendary Purple Helmets a Stranglers offshoot. Between 1992 and 1996, whilst remaining in the Glitter Band, Phipps joined Denim, a band formed by Lawrence Heywood. He recorded ''Back in Denim'' (1992 and ''Denim on Ice'' (1996). Through 1998 and 1999, Phipps had further shows with The Glitter Band and appearances with The King Penguins, a spin-off from the Glitter Band.

The year 2000 saw the founding of Santanarama, a six-piece tribute to Carlos Santana, and Glitz Blitz, a three-piece tribute to the 1970s. Early in 2001, along with shows with the Glitter Band, Santanarama and Glitz Blitz at a range of venues nationwide, Phipps made a return to playing some R&amp;B with a South East-based band Desperate Measures. Later in the year, he recorded an album of material with Alan Merrill of the Arrows which was released the following year.

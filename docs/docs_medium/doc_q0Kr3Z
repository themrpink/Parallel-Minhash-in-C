What resulted was the [[Treaty of Aberconwy]], which guaranteed peace in Gwynedd in return for several difficult concessions from Llywelyn, including confining his authority to Gwynedd Uwch Conwy once again. Part of Gwynedd Is Conwy was given to Dafydd ap Gruffydd, with a promise that if Llywelyn died without an heir, he would be given a share of Gwynedd Uwch Conwy instead.

Llywelyn was forced to acknowledge the English king as his sovereign; initially he had refused, but after the events of 1276, Llywelyn was stripped of all but a small portion of his lands. He went to meet Edward, and found Eleanor lodged with the royal family at [[Worcester, England|Worcester]]; after Llywelyn agreed to Edward's demands, Edward gave them permission to be married at [[Worcester Cathedral]]. A stained glass window exists to this day depicting the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Eleanor. By all accounts, the marriage was a genuine love match; Llywelyn is not known to have fathered any illegitimate children, which is extremely unusual for the Welsh royalty. (In medieval Wales, illegitimate children were as entitled to their father's property as legitimate children.)

[[File:Death of Llywelyn.jpg|thumb|The death of Llywelyn]]

By early 1282, many of the lesser princes who had supported Edward against Llywelyn in 1277 were becoming disillusioned with the exactions of the royal officers. On [[Palm Sunday]] that year, Dafydd ap Gruffydd attacked the English at [[Hawarden Castle (medieval)|Hawarden Castle]] and then laid siege to [[Rhuddlan]]. The revolt quickly spread to other parts of Wales, with [[Aberystwyth]] castle captured and burnt and rebellion in Ystrad Tywi in south Wales, also inspired by Dafydd according to the annals, where [[Carreg Cennen castle]] was captured.

Llywelyn, according to a letter he sent to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Peckham]], was not involved in the planning of the revolt. He felt obliged, however, to support his brother and a war began for which the Welsh were ill-prepared. Personal tragedy also struck him at this time when, on or about 19 June 1282, his wife, [[Eleanor de Montfort]], died shortly after giving birth to their daughter, [[Gwenllian of Wales|Gwenllian]].

[[File:Llywelyn5.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Llywelyn Monument at [[Cilmeri]] near [[Builth Wells]]]]

Events followed a similar pattern to 1277, with Edward's forces capturing Gwynedd Is Conwy, Anglesey and taking the harvest. The force occupying Anglesey were defeated, however, when trying to cross to the mainland in the [[Battle of Moel-y-don]]. The Archbishop of Canterbury tried mediating between Llywelyn and Edward, and Llywelyn was offered a large estate in England if he would surrender Wales to Edward, while Dafydd was to go on crusade and not return without the king's permission. In an emotional reply, which has been compared to the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], Llywelyn said he would not abandon the people whom his ancestors had protected since &quot;the days of [[Kamber]] son of [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]]&quot; and rejected the offer.

Llywelyn now left Dafydd to lead the defence of Gwynedd and took a force south, trying to rally support in mid and south Wales and open up an important second front. On 11 December at the [[Battle of Orewin Bridge]] at [[Builth Wells]], he was killed while separated from his army. The exact circumstances are unclear and there are two conflicting accounts of his death. Both accounts agree that Llywelyn was tricked into leaving the bulk of his army and was then attacked and killed. The first account says that Llywelyn and his chief minister approached the forces of [[Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer|Edmund Mortimer]] and [[Hugh Le Strange]] after crossing a bridge. They then heard the sound of battle as the main body of his army was met in battle by the forces of [[Roger Despenser]] and [[Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn]]. Llywelyn turned to rejoin his forces and was pursued by a lone lancer who struck him down. It was not until some time later that an English knight recognised the body as that of the prince. This version of events was written in the north of England some fifty years later and has suspicious similarities with details about the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] in Scotland.

An alternative version of events written in the east of England by monks in contact with Llywelyn's exiled daughter, [[Gwenllian ferch Llywelyn]], and niece, [[Gwladys ferch Dafydd]], states that Llywelyn, at the front of his army, approached the combined forces of Edmund and Roger Mortimer, Hugo Le Strange, and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn on the promise that he would receive their homage. This was a deception. His army was immediately engaged in fierce battle during which a significant section of it was routed, causing Llywelyn and his eighteen retainers to become separated. At around dusk, Llywelyn and a small group of his retainers (which included clergy) were ambushed and chased into a wood at [[Aberedw]]. Llywelyn was surrounded and struck down. As he lay dying, he asked for a priest and gave away his identity. He was then killed and his head hewn from his body. His person was searched and various items recovered, including a list of &quot;conspirators&quot;, which may well have been faked, and his privy seal.

{{quote|If the king wishes to have the copy [of the list] found in the breeches of Llywelyn, he can have it from Edmund Mortimer, who has custody of it and also of Llywelyn’s privy seal and certain other things found in the same place.|Archbishop Peckham, in his first letter to Robert Bishop of Bath and Wells, 17 December 1282 ([[Lambeth Palace]] Archives)&lt;ref name=&quot;cilmeri1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cilmeri.org/eng/?page_id=5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702053329/http://www.cilmeri.org/eng/?page_id=5 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2017-07-02 |title=Death of Llywelyn |publisher=Cilmeri |date=2006-12-10 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are legends surrounding the fate of Llywelyn's severed head. It is known that it was sent to Edward at Rhuddlan and after being shown to the English troops based in Anglesey, Edward sent the head on to London. In London, it was set up in the city [[pillory]] for a day, and crowned with [[ivy]] (i.e. to show he was a &quot;king&quot; of Outlaws and in mockery of the ancient Welsh prophecy, which said that a Welshman would be crowned in London as king of the whole of Britain). Then it was carried by a horseman on the point of his lance to the [[Tower of London]] and set up over the gate. It was still on the Tower of London 15 years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;cilmeri1&quot;/&gt;

The last resting place of Llywelyn's body is not known for certain; however, it has always been tradition that it was interred at the [[Cistercian]] [[Abbey]] at [[Abbeycwmhir]]. On 28 December 1282, Archbishop Peckham wrote a letter to the [[Archdeacon of Brecon]] at [[Brecon Priory]], in order to

&lt;blockquote&gt;... inquire and clarify if the body of Llywelyn has been buried in the church of Cwmhir, and he was bound to clarify the latter before the feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], because he had another mandate on this matter, and ought to have certified the lord Archbishop before Christmas, and has not done so.&lt;ref name=&quot;cilmeri1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is further supporting evidence for this hypothesis in the Chronicle of [[Florence of Worcester]]:

[[File:Aerial view of Abaty Cwm Hir.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the ruined abbey of Cwm Hir]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for the body of the Prince, his mangled trunk, it was interred in the Abbey of Cwm Hir, belonging to the Cistercian Order.&lt;ref name=&quot;cilmeri1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another theory is that his body was transferred to [[Llanrumney|Llanrumney Hall]] in [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Tryst | last = Williams | title = Last true Welsh prince buried under pub? | url = http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0200wales/tm_objectid=15831549&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50082&amp;headline=last-true-welsh-prince-buried-under-pub--name_page.html  | work = [[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] | date= 8 August 2005 | accessdate = 18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Gruffydd ab yr Ynad Coch]] wrote in an [[elegy]] on Llywelyn:

&lt;poem&gt;Do you not see the path of the wind and the rain?
Do you not see the oak trees in turmoil?

Cold my heart in a fearful breast
For the king, the oaken door of Aberffraw&lt;/poem&gt;

There is an enigmatic reference in the Welsh annals [[Brut y Tywysogion]], &quot;… and then Llywelyn was betrayed in the belfry at Bangor by his own men&quot;. No further explanation is given.

With the loss of Llywelyn, Welsh morale and the will to resist diminished. Dafydd was Llywelyn's named successor. He carried on the struggle for several months, but in June 1283 was captured in the uplands above [[Abergwyngregyn]] at Bera Mountain together with his family. He was brought before Edward, then taken to [[Shrewsbury]] where a special session of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] condemned him to death. He was dragged through the streets, [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].

After the final defeat of 1283, Gwynedd was stripped of all royal insignia, relics, and regalia. Edward took particular delight in appropriating the royal home of the Gwynedd dynasty. In August 1284, he set up his court at [[Abergwyngregyn]], Gwynedd. With equal deliberateness, he removed all the insignia of majesty from Gwynedd; a coronet was solemnly presented to the shrine of St. Edward at Westminster; the matrices of the seals of Llywelyn, of his wife, and of his brother Dafydd were melted down to make a chalice which was given by the king to [[Vale Royal Abbey]] where it remained until the dissolution of that institution in 1538, after which it came into the possession of the family of the final abbot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=39978 |chapter= Houses of Cistercian monks: The abbey of Vale Royal |title=A History of the County of Chester |volume= 3 |pages = 156–165 |year= 1980 |publisher= Victoria County History | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The most precious religious relic in Gwynedd, the fragment of the True Cross known as [[Cross of Neith]], was paraded through London in May 1285 in a solemn procession on foot led by the king, the queen, the archbishop of Canterbury and fourteen bishops, and the magnates of the realm. Edward was thereby appropriating the historical and religious regalia of the house of Gwynedd and placarding to the world the extinction of its dynasty and the annexation of the principality to his Crown. Commenting on this a contemporary chronicler is said to have declared &quot;and then all Wales was cast to the ground.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/culture_preserved_03.shtml |title=Wales: A Culture Preserved |last=Davies |first=Rees |date=1 May 2001 |page=3 |publisher=bbc.co.uk/history |accessdate=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Llywelyn's relatives ended their lives in captivity with the notable exceptions of his younger brother [[Rhodri ap Gruffydd]], who had long since sold his claim to the crown and endeavoured to keep a very low profile, and a distant cousin, [[Madog ap Llywelyn]], who led a future revolt and claimed the title [[Prince of Wales]] in 1294. Llywelyn and Eleanor's baby daughter [[Gwenllian of Wales]] was captured by Edward's troops in 1283. She was interned at Sempringham Priory in England for the rest of her life, becoming a [[nun]] in 1317 and dying without issue in 1337, probably knowing little of her heritage and speaking none of her language.

Dafydd's two surviving [[Llywelyn ap Dafydd|sons]] were captured and incarcerated at [[Bristol]] Gaol, where they eventually died many years later. Llywelyn's elder brother [[Owain Goch]] disappears from the record in 1282. Llywelyn's surviving brother [[Rhodri ap Gruffydd|Rhodri]] (who had been exiled from Wales since 1272) survived and held manors in Gloucestershire, Cheshire, Surrey, and Powys and died around 1315. His grandson, [[Owain Lawgoch]], later claimed the title [[Prince of Wales]].

==Historical fiction==
The life of Llywelyn the Last is the subject of [[Edith Pargeter]]'s ''Brothers of Gwynedd Quartet'': 'Sunrise in the West' (1974); 'The Dragon at Noonday' (1975); 'The Hounds of Sunset' (1976); and 'Afterglow and Nightfall' (1977).

The lives of Llywelyn Fawr, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd and Dafydd ap Gruffydd are the subject of [[Sharon Penman]]'s &quot;Welsh Trilogy&quot;: ''Here be Dragons'' (1985); ''Falls the Shadow'' (1988); and ''The Reckoning'' (1991).

An alternate history/time travel series, ''After Cilmeri'' by Sarah Woodbury, explores what might have happened if Llywelyn had survived the ambush at Cilmeri, and had a son and assistance from people from the future.

Llywelyn the Last is the subject of the [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]] song &quot;Llewellyn&quot;.  The song focuses on the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I]], but specifically on the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I#Campaign of 1282-83|Campaign of 1282-83]].  In the song, the band claims &quot;In September, Edward &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Edward I]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; moved up to the baird/ His forces stronger every day/ Llewellyn then turned southward bound/ His forces lay upon the ground.&quot;  It also claims that the message of Llywelyn's death came &quot;soon thereafter.&quot;

Llywelyn is a minor character in Jean Plaidy's novel ''Edward Longshanks'', the seventh novel of the Plantagenet Saga series.

[[Bertrice Small]] includes Llywelyn's life in her book, ''A Memory of Love'', which centres on the fictional life of one of his illegitimate children, Rhonwyn.

A '''bomb''' is an [[explosive weapon]] that uses the [[Exothermic process|exothermic reaction]] of an [[explosive material]] to provide an extremely sudden and violent release of [[energy]]. [[Detonation]]s inflict damage principally through ground- and atmosphere-transmitted mechanical [[stress (mechanics)|stress]], the impact and penetration of pressure-driven projectiles, pressure damage, and explosion-generated effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milstein 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Milstein|first=Randall L.|title=Forensic Science|url=https://archive.org/details/forensicscience00emba|url-access=limited|chapter=Bomb damage assessment|editor=Ayn Embar-seddon |editor2=Allan D.

The term bomb is not usually applied to explosive devices used for [[civilian]] purposes such as [[construction]] or [[mining]], although the people using the devices may sometimes refer to them as a &quot;bomb&quot;. The military use of the term &quot;bomb&quot;, or more specifically [[aerial bomb]] action, typically refers to airdropped, unpowered explosive weapons most commonly used by [[air force]]s and [[naval aviation]]. Other military explosive weapons not classified as &quot;bombs&quot; include [[shell (projectile)|shells]], [[depth charge]]s (used in water), or [[land mine]]s. In [[unconventional warfare]], other names can refer to a range of offensive weaponry. For instance, in recent Middle Eastern conflicts, homemade bombs called &quot;[[improvised explosive device]]s&quot; (IEDs) have been employed by insurgent fighters to great effectiveness.

The word comes from the [[Latin]] ''bombus'', which in turn comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] βόμβος (''bombos''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbo%2Fmbos βόμβος] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107082014/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbo%2Fmbos |date=2013-11-07 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; an [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] term meaning &quot;booming&quot;, &quot;buzzing&quot;.

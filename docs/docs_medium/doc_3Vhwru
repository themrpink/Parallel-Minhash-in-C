Counterexamples:
* The prefix code {''ab'',''ba''} is not self-synchronizing because ''abab'' contains ''ba''.
* The prefix code ''b''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;a (using the [[Kleene star]]) is not self-synchronizing (even though any new code word simply starts after een ''a'') because code word ''ba'' contains code word ''a''.

'''Separate-channel signaling''' is a form of [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]] in which the whole or a part of one or more channels in a multichannel system is used to provide for supervisory and control signals for the message traffic channels.  

The same channels, such as [[frequency band]]s or [[Time-division multiplexing|time slots]], that are used for signaling are not used for message traffic.

The cited &quot;strap&quot; may be the ridge on the front (so denoted by the visible pattern of the ox hide) of the shield.]]

A '''shield''' is a piece of [[personal armour]] held in the hand, which may or may not be strapped to the wrist or forearm. Shields are used to intercept specific attacks, whether from [[melee weapon|close-ranged weaponry]] or projectiles such as [[arrow]]s, by means of active blocks, as well as to provide passive protection by closing one or more lines of engagement during combat.

Shields vary greatly in size and shape, ranging from large panels that protect the user's whole body to small models (such as the [[buckler]]) that were intended for hand-to-hand-combat use. Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; whereas some shields were made of relatively deep, absorbent, wooden planking to protect soldiers from the impact of [[spear]]s and [[crossbow]] bolts, others were thinner and lighter and designed mainly for deflecting blade strikes (like the [[roromaraugi]] or [[qauata]]). Finally, shields vary greatly in shape, ranging in roundness to angularity, proportional length and width, symmetry and edge pattern; different shapes provide more optimal protection for infantry or cavalry, enhance portability, provide secondary uses such as ship protection or as a weapon and so on.

In prehistory and during the era of the earliest civilisations, shields were made of wood, animal hide, woven reeds or [[wicker]]. In classical antiquity, the [[Barbarian Invasions]] and the [[Middle Ages]], they were normally constructed of poplar tree, lime or another split-resistant timber, covered in some instances with a material such as leather or rawhide and often reinforced with a metal boss, rim or banding. They were carried by foot soldiers, knights and cavalry.

Depending on time and place, shields could be round, oval, square, rectangular, triangular, bilabial or scalloped. Sometimes they took on the form of kites or flatirons, or had rounded tops on a rectangular base with perhaps an eye-hole, to look through when used with combat. The shield was held by a central grip or by straps with some going over or around the user's arm and one or more being held by the hand.

Often shields were decorated with a painted pattern or an animal representation to show their army or clan. These designs developed into systematized [[heraldic]] devices during the [[High Middle Ages]] for purposes of battlefield identification. Even after the introduction of gunpowder and firearms to the battlefield, shields continued to be used by certain groups. In the 18th century, for example, [[Scottish Highland]] fighters liked to wield small shields known as [[targe]]s, and as late as the 19th century, some non-industrialized peoples (such as [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] warriors) employed them when waging war.

In the 20th and 21st century, shields have been used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist actions, hostage rescue, riot control and siege-breaking.

==Development of shields==
[[File:Mindanao Bangsamoro &amp; Lumad Shields &amp; Knives.jpg|thumb|Elaborate and sophisticated shields from the [[Philippines]].]]
=== Prehistory===
The oldest form of shield was a protection device designed to block attacks by [[hand weapon]]s, such as swords, axes and maces, or ranged weapons like sling-stones and arrows. Shields have varied greatly in construction over time and place. Sometimes shields were made of metal, but [[wood]] or [[Rawhide (textile)|animal hide]] construction was much more common; [[wicker]] and even turtle shells have been used. Many surviving examples of metal shields are generally felt to be ceremonial rather than practical, for example the [[Yetholm-type shields]] of the [[Bronze Age]], or the [[Iron Age]] [[Battersea Shield|Battersea shield]].

===Ancient history===
[[File:Greek soldiers of Greco–Persian Wars.png|left|thumb|Greek soldiers of [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. Left: Greek [[Sling (weapon)|slinger]]. Right: [[hoplite]]s. Middle: hoplite's shield has a curtain which serves as a protection from arrows.]]
Size and weight varied greatly. [[Light infantry|Lightly armored warriors]] relying on speed and surprise would generally carry light shields (''pelte'') that were either small or thin. [[Heavy infantry|Heavy troops]] might be equipped with robust shields that could cover most of the body. Many had a strap called a [[guige]] that allowed them to be slung over the user's back when not in use or on horseback. During the 14th–13th century&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Sherden|Sards or Shardana]], working as [[mercenaries]] for the Egyptian pharaoh [[Ramses II]], utilized either large or small round shields against the [[Hittites]]. The [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] used two types of shields: the &quot;figure-of-eight&quot; shield and a rectangular &quot;tower&quot; shield. These shields were made primarily from a wicker frame and then reinforced with leather. Covering the body from head to foot, the figure-of-eight and tower shield offered most of the warrior's body a good deal of protection in hand-to-hand combat. The Ancient Greek [[hoplites]] used a round, bowl-shaped wooden shield that was reinforced with bronze and called an ''[[aspis]]''. Another name for this type of shield is a ''hoplon''. The hoplon shield inspired the name for hoplite soldiers. The hoplon was also the longest-lasting and most famous and influential of all of the ancient Greek shields. The Spartans used the aspis to create the Greek phalanx formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientmilitary.com/spartan-weapons.htm |title=Spartan Weapons |publisher=Ancientmilitary.com |access-date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their shields offered protection not only for themselves but for their comrades to their left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientmilitary.com/spartan-military.htm |title=Spartan Military |publisher=Ancientmilitary.com |access-date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Germanic wooden shields circa 350&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– 500&amp;nbsp;AD survive from [[weapons sacrifice]]s in Danish bogs.

The heavily armored [[Roman legionaries]] carried large shields ([[scutum (shield)|''scuta'']]) that could provide far more protection, but made swift movement a little more difficult. The ''scutum'' originally had an oval shape, but gradually the curved tops and sides were cut to produce the familiar rectangular shape most commonly seen in the early Imperial legions. Famously, the Romans used their shields to create a tortoise-like formation called a [[testudo formation|''testudo'']] in which entire groups of soldiers would be enclosed in an armoured box to provide protection against missiles. Many ancient shield designs featured incuts of one sort or another. This was done to accommodate the shaft of a spear, thus facilitating tactics requiring the soldiers to stand close together forming a [[Shield wall|wall of shields]].

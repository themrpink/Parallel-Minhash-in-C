Merchandising for a film was a relatively new concept popularized by the ''Star Wars'' film series.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesJun89&quot;/&gt; As ''Back to the Future'' was not specifically aimed at children, there was no significant merchandising at the time of its release. One of the earliest items was a rideable DeLorean for children, released in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;SyFyMerch&quot;/&gt; Since then, the film and its sequels have been represented across a wide variety of merchandise produced for fans including: [[Playmobil]], playing cards, clothing, pottery, posters,&lt;ref name=&quot;EmpireMerch&quot;/&gt; board games,&lt;ref name=&quot;EmpireMerch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsweekMerch&quot;/&gt; sculpted figures, plush toys,&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsweekMerch&quot;/&gt; [[Funko|Funko POP!]] figures, action figures,&lt;ref name=&quot;SyFyMerch&quot;/&gt; [[Hot Wheels]] and [[Die-cast toy|die-cast]] vehicles,{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=232}}&lt;ref name=&quot;SyFyMerch&quot;/&gt; books, music albums,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCMagMerch&quot;/&gt; and Christmas ornaments.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=232}}

There have been several video game adaptations of the film. ''[[Back to the Future (1985 video game)|Back to the Future]]'' was released alongside the film for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CGMSpectrum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGGames&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|AmstradAction|1987|p=13}} An arcade-adventure game, ''[[Back to the Future (1989 video game)|Back to the Future]]'', was released in 1989 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. In it, the player guides Marty around levels to collect clocks and avoid obstacles. Gale called it one of the worst games ever made and advised people not to purchase it.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGGames&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GeeksandSundry&quot;/&gt; ''[[Back to the Future: The Pinball]]'' was released in 1990. Fox did not give permission for the developers to use his likeness, so a different model was used for Marty McFly.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeeksandSundry&quot;/&gt; An [[Episodic video game|episodic]] [[Graphic adventure game|graphic adventure]] game, ''[[Back to the Future: The Game]]'', was released in 2010. Gale contributed to the game's narrative, which takes place after the events of the third film in the series. It follows Doc's and Marty's adventures through time. Lloyd voiced Doc Brown, and Fox performed minor voice work as a McFly ancestor.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeeksandSundry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PasteMagLegacy&quot;/&gt; An area in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'' is based on ''Back to the Future'' and features voice work by Lloyd.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeeksandSundry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EWGame&quot;/&gt;

''[[Back to the Future: The Ride]]'', a [[simulator ride]], ran from 1991 to 2007 at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The ride's development was supervised by Spielberg and featured Lloyd reprising his role as Doc Brown to chase down Biff (played by Wilson) who has stolen the DeLorean. A version of the ride is still active at [[Universal Studios Japan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PasteMagLegacy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPRPopCulture&quot;/&gt; A ''Back to the Future''-themed [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] board-game was released in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;EmpireMerch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SlashMonopoly&quot;/&gt; A [[Funko]] board game was released in 2020. It casts players as one of the main characters from the films to battle different Tannens across history.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsweekMerch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DigitalSpyFunko&quot;/&gt;

There have been several books about the making of the film series. ''We Don't Need Roads: The Making of the Back to the Future Trilogy'' is an oral history by those involved in the production, including Gale and Zemeckis.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPRPopCulture&quot;/&gt; ''Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History''—a book chronicling the development of the entire ''Back to the Future'' franchise—was released in 2015. It contains previously unseen photos from the production.&lt;ref name=&quot;UproxxVisualHistory&quot;/&gt; The [[British Film Institute]] released ''BFI Film Classics: Back to the Future'' about the film's background.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCMagMerch&quot;/&gt; A novelization by [[George Gipe]] was released in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoodReadsNovel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;i09Novel&quot;/&gt; There has also been a crossover between the ''Back to the Future'' and [[Transformers]] franchises. This included featuring a transforming DeLorean toy and associated comic books.&lt;ref name=&quot;MerchTransformers&quot;/&gt;

==Sequels and adaptations==
{{main||Back to the Future Part II|Back to the Future Part III|Back to the Future (TV series)|Back to the Future (musical)}}
[[File:Elisabeth Shue at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Elizabeth Shue shown smiling at the camera |[[Elisabeth Shue]] pictured in 2009. When [[Claudia Wells]] left the series to care for her mother, Shue replaced her in the role of [[Jennifer Parker]].]] 
The film's success spawned the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' franchise]] comprising film sequels, animated television shows, video games, comic books, and a wide variety of merchandise. It is considered one of the most successful film franchises.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THRComicBooks&quot;/&gt; A sequel was not planned before ''Back to the Future''{{'}}s release. The teaser ending of Doc, Marty, and Jennifer flying off in the DeLorean was intended to suggest their adventures would continue off screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOG88Things&quot;/&gt; Again written by Gale and Zemeckis, the sequel script was so long that it was split into two films, ''[[Back to the Future Part&amp;nbsp;II]]'' and ''Back to the Future Part&amp;nbsp;III''; both films were shot back to back.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGBTTF2&quot;/&gt;

''Part&amp;nbsp;II'' was released in 1989. In its story, Marty and Doc travel to 2015, inadvertently enabling the now-elderly Biff Tannen to steal the DeLorean and return to 1955, rewriting history in his favor.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGBTTF2&quot;/&gt; Wells and Glover did not return for the sequels. Wells opted to care for her ailing mother; [[Elisabeth Shue]] replaced her. [[Jeffrey Weissman]] replaced Glover. The reason for Glover's replacement is disputed: Gale maintains that Glover demanded too much money to participate; Glover countered that Gale and Zemeckis never intended to bring him back, as they were upset that he had challenged them over the moral message of the first film's ending.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPRPopCulture&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortlistDudley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVClubGlover&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HighSnobiety&quot;/&gt; ''Part&amp;nbsp;II'' was a financial success but was criticized for its complex, convoluted narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;THRSequels&quot;/&gt; Zemeckis has said ''Part&amp;nbsp;II'' is his least favorite film in the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGBTTF2&quot;/&gt; The final film in the trilogy, ''Part&amp;nbsp;III'', was released in 1990. Its plot follows Marty as he travels to 1885 to rescue a time-stranded Doc.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGBTTF3&quot;/&gt; While the film fared less well financially than the two earlier films, it was more critically well-received than ''Part&amp;nbsp;II''.&lt;ref name=&quot;THRSequels&quot;/&gt;

A 2018 poll by ''The Hollywood Reporter'' of 2,200 people found that 71% of those asked wanted a ''Back to the Future'' sequel, ahead of another ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' or ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' film.&lt;ref name=&quot;SkyTHRMostWanted&quot;/&gt; In the years since the release of ''Part&amp;nbsp;III'', studios have attempted to convince Gale and Zemeckis to make another film; the pair shares a controlling interest in the series, preventing sequels being made without their permission. Gale has said there will never be a fourth film. He likened it to &quot;selling your kids into prostitution&quot;. He added a ''Back to the Future'' film could never happen without Marty McFly, and Fox could not participate because of the effects of his Parkinson's disease. There was also concern that other popular film series had been revived for sequels only to be critical failures.&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioTimes4thFilm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EmpireParkinsons&quot;/&gt;

An animated television series, ''[[Back to the Future (TV series)|Back to the Future]]'', which aired on [[CBS]] in 1991–1992 followed the films. The series followed Doc's and Marty's adventures through various historical periods, intercut with live-action segments featuring Lloyd, as Doc, performing science experiments alongside [[Bill Nye]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PasteMagLegacy&quot;/&gt; The series' narrative has been expanded in comics and video games that detail Doc's and Marty's adventures before and after the events depicted in the films.&lt;ref name=&quot;THRComicBooks&quot;/&gt; A short film ''Doc Brown Saves the World'' was released in 2015 to celebrate the film's 35th anniversary. Written by Gale and Zemeckis, it follows Doc Brown, portrayed by Lloyd, who must travel to the future to prevent a nuclear holocaust in 2045.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScreenRantSavestheWorld&quot;/&gt; [[Josh Gad]], as part of his &quot;Reunited Apart&quot; charity series of events during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], included a ''Back to the Future'' retrospective episode in May 2020 that included the participation of Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, Steenburgen, Wells, Shue, Gale, Zemeckis, Silvestri, Lewis, and a guest appearance by [[J.J. Abrams]] who expressed his admiration for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;RollingStoneReunitedApart&quot;/&gt;

A [[Musical theatre|musical theater]] production, ''[[Back to the Future (musical)|Back to the Future]]'', was announced in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicalBBC&quot;/&gt; The musical was written by Gale and Zemeckis, with music written by Silvestri and [[Glen Ballard]]. It debuted at the [[Manchester Opera House]], England, in February 2020, to positive critical reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicalStandard&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicalGuardian&quot;/&gt; Gale said the musical was the best way to give fans more ''Back to the Future'' without adding to the film series.&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioTimes4thFilm&quot;/&gt;

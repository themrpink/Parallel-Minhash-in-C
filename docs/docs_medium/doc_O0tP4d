==Music==
{{Main|Music of Egypt}} 
Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous Egyptian and Western influences.

As early as [[4th millennium BC|4000 BC]], ancient Egyptians were playing [[harps]] and [[flutes]], as well as two indigenous instruments: the [[ney]] and the [[oud]]. However, there is a little notation of Egyptian music before the 7th century AD, when Egypt became part of the [[Muslim world]]. [[Percussion instrument|Percussion]] and [[vocal]] music became important at this time and has remained an important part of Egyptian music today.

Contemporary [[Music of Egypt|Egyptian music]] traces its beginnings to the creative work of luminaries such as Abdu-l Hamuli, Almaz, Sayed Mikkawi, and Mahmud Osman, who were all patronized by [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Ismail]] and who influenced the later work of [[Sayed Darwish]], [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]], [[Abdel Halim Hafez]] and other Egyptian music giants.

From the 1970s onwards, Egyptian [[pop music]] has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture, particularly among the large youth population of Egypt. Egyptian [[folk music]] is also popular, played during weddings and other festivities. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Egyptian music was a way to communicate [[social issue|social]] and [[social class|class]] issues. The most popular Egyptian pop singers are [[Amr Diab]], [[Tamer Hosny]], [[Mohamed Mounir]] and [[Ali El Haggar]]. One of the most respected early [[electronic music]] composers, [[Halim El-Dabh]], is an Egyptian.

[[Belly dance]], or ''Raqs Sharqi'' (literally: oriental dancing) may have originated in Egypt, and today the country is considered the international center of the art.

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Egyptian cuisine}}

Egyptian cuisine consists of local culinary traditions such as [[Ful medames]], [[Kushari]], and [[Molokhia]]. It also shares similarities with food found throughout the eastern Mediterranean like [[kebab]] and [[falafel]].

[[File:Denarius of Thrasamund.jpg|thumb|Thrasamund's effigy on a silver denarius coin]]
'''Thrasamund''' (450–523), King of the [[Vandals]] and [[Alans]] (496–523), was the fourth king of the north African Kingdom of the Vandals. He reigned longer than any other Vandal king in Africa other than his grandfather [[Genseric]].

Thrasamund was the third son born to Genseric's fourth son, [[Gento (son of Genseric)|Gento]], and became king in 496 after all of Genseric's sons and his own brother, King [[Gunthamund]], had died. Upon Gunthamund's death, he was one of only two living grandsons of Genseric, and inherited the throne in accordance with a law enacted by his grandfather, which bestowed the kingship on the eldest male member of a deceased king's family. 

[[Theoderic the Great]] married his widowed sister [[Amalafrida]] to Thrasamund, providing a dowry consisting of the promontory of [[Lilybaeum]] in [[Sicily]], and a retinue of a thousand elite troops and five thousand armed retainers.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''De Bellis'' III.8.11-13. Translated by H.B. Dewing, ''Procopius'' (Cambridge: Loeb Classical Library, 1979), vol. 2 p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herwig Wolfram]] believes this happened in 500, &quot;immediately after his [Theoderic] Roman tricennial&quot;. Despite this alliance, Thrasamund failed to aid Theoderic when the [[Byzantine Navy]] ravaged the coast of southern Italy, preventing him from coming to the assistance of King [[Alaric II|Alaric]] of the [[Visigoths]] in the [[Battle of Vouillé]], which contributed to Alaric's defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', translated by Thomas J. Dunlap (Berkeley: University of California, 1988), p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Procopius]] describes a battle between the [[Berbers]] of [[Tripoli]] under [[Cabaon]] and the Vandals, in which the Berbers used unusual tactics to defeat the Vandal cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, III.8.15 - 29; translated by Dewing, vol. 2 pp. 77 - 83&lt;/ref&gt; In the final year of his reign, the important port city of [[Leptis Magna]] was sacked by the Berbers.

Thrasamund also ended many years of persecution of the [[Catholic Church]] which had begun under his uncle [[Huneric]], a move which improved the Vandals' relations with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Procopius]] states that he was &quot;a very special friend of the Emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, III.8.14; translated by Dewing, vol. 2 p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrasamund died in 523 and was succeeded by his cousin [[Hilderic]], the firstborn son of Huneric.

'''Gunthamund''' (c. 450–496), King of the [[Vandals]] and [[Alans]] (484-496) was the third king of the north African [[Vandal Kingdom]]. He succeeded his unpopular uncle [[Huneric]], and for that reason alone, enjoyed a rather successful reign.

Gunthamund was the second son born to [[Gento (son of Genseric)|Gento]], the fourth and youngest son of [[Genseric]], the founder of the Vandal kingdom in Africa. Because most of Genseric's immediate family was dead, his elder brothers having been murdered by Huneric,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dark Ages |url=https://archive.org/details/darkages02omangoog |last=Oman |first=Charles |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunthamund found himself as the eldest male member of the family when Huneric died on 23 December 484. In accordance with his grandfather's laws on succession, which decreed that the oldest member of the family would be the successor, he was proclaimed king.

Gunthamund benefited throughout his reign from the fact that the Vandals' most powerful rivals, the [[Visigoths]], [[Ostrogoths]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]], were all heavily involved in wars. Although the Vandals' power had fallen off greatly since its zenith under Genseric, they enjoyed peace under Gunthamund. Gunthamund also eased up on the persecutions of Catholic [[Roman Catholic Church|Christians]] that had begun under Huneric, a move which eased some of the unrest in his kingdom, and stabilized the kingdom's economy, which had been on the verge of collapse.

Unfortunately for the Vandals, Gunthamund died in his mid-forties and thus did not reign for a long time. He was succeeded by his brother [[Thrasamund]], who was not as effective in ruling the kingdom.

The '''War of Jenkins' Ear''' (known as {{lang|es|Guerra del Asiento}} in Spain) was a conflict between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Spain]] lasting from 1739 to 1748, mainly in [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] and among the [[West Indies]] of the [[Caribbean Sea]], with major operations largely ended by 1742. Its name, coined by British historian [[Thomas Carlyle]] in 1858,&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle discusses Jenkins' Ear in several passages of his ''History of Friedrich II''(1858), most notably in Book XI, chap VI, where he refers specifically to &quot;the War of Jenkins's Ear&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; refers to [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]], a captain of a British [[merchant ship]], who suffered having his ear severed when Spanish sailors boarded his ship at a time of peace. There is no evidence that supports the stories that the severed ear was exhibited before the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]].

The seeds of conflict began with the injury to Jenkins following the boarding of his vessel by Spanish coast guards in 1731, eight years before the war began. Popular response to the incident was tepid until several years later, when opposition politicians and the British [[South Sea Company]] played it up, hoping to spur outrage against Spain, believing that a victorious war would improve Britain's trading opportunities in the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]].&lt;ref name=Graboyes&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3711623 | pmid=23444484 | volume=34 | issue=2 | title=The War of Jenkins' Ear | journal=Otol Neurotol | pages=368–72 | last1 = Graboyes | first1 = EM | last2 = Hullar | first2 = TE| year=2013 | doi=10.1097/mao.0b013e31827c9f7a }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the British wanted to keep pressure on Spain to honour their lucrative ''[[asiento]]'' contract, which gave British [[slave traders]] permission to sell slaves in [[Spanish America]]. The Spanish refer to this ''asiento'' in their name for this war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHDBE|Olson]], pp.&amp;nbsp;1121–22&lt;/ref&gt;

British attacks on Spanish possessions in [[Central America]] resulted in high casualties, primarily from disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webb, pp. 396–398&quot;&gt;[[#refMA|Webb]], pp.&amp;nbsp;396–398&lt;/ref&gt; After 1742, the war was subsumed by the wider [[War of the Austrian Succession]], which involved most of the powers of Europe. Peace arrived with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748.

==Background==
[[File:The seat of war in the West Indies 1740.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1740 English map of [[Havana]], published to build support for the war]]
The cause of the war is traditionally seen as a dispute between Britain and Spain over access to markets in [[New Spain|Spanish America]]. Historians such as [[Matthew Smith Anderson|Anderson]] and Woodfine argue it was one of several issues, including tensions with France and British expansion in North America. They suggest the decisive factor in turning a commercial dispute into war was the domestic political campaign to remove [[Robert Walpole]], long-serving British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].{{sfn|James|2001|p=61}}

The 18th century economic theory of [[mercantilism]] viewed trade as a finite resource; if one country increased its share, it was at the expense of others and wars were often fought over commercial issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rothbard|first1=Murray|title=Mercantilism as the Economic Side of Absolutism|url=https://mises.org/library/mercantilism-economic-side-absolutism|website=Mises.org|date=23 April 2010|publisher=Good summary of the concept|accessdate=27 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] gave British merchants access to markets in Spanish America, including the ''[[Asiento]] de Negros'', a monopoly to supply 5,000 slaves a year. Another was the ''Navio de Permiso'', permitting two ships a year to sell 500 tons of goods each in [[Portobelo, Colón|Porto Bello]] and [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]].{{sfn|Browning|1993|p=21}} These rights were assigned to the [[South Sea Company]], acquired by the British government in 1720.{{sfn|Ibañez|2008|p=16}}

However, trade between Britain and mainland Spain was far more significant. British goods were imported through [[Cadiz]], either for sale locally or re-exported to Spanish colonies, with Spanish dye and wool being sold to England. A leading [[City of London]] merchant called the trade 'the best flower in our garden.'{{sfn|Mclachlan|1940|p=6}} The ''asiento'' itself was marginally profitable and has been described as a 'commercial illusion'; between 1717 and 1733, only eight ships were sent from Britain to the Americas.{{sfn|Anderson|1976|p=293}} Previous holders made money by carrying smuggled goods that evaded customs duties, demand from Spanish colonists creating a large and profitable [[black market]].{{sfn|Richmond|1920|==2}}

Accepting the trade was too widespread to be stopped, the Spanish authorities used it as an instrument of policy. During the 1727 to 1729 [[Anglo-Spanish War (1727–1729)|Anglo-Spanish War]], French ships carrying contraband were let through, while British ships were stopped and severe restrictions imposed on British merchants in Cadiz. This was reversed during the 1733 to 1735 [[War of the Polish Succession]], when Britain supported Spanish acquisitions in [[Italy]].{{sfn|Mclachlan|1940|pp=91–93}} 
[[File:gacolony.png|thumb|right|220px|The establishment of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] in 1733 raised tensions by threatening Spanish possessions in the Caribbean Basin.]]
The 1729 [[Treaty of Seville (1729)|Treaty of Seville]] allowed the Spanish to board British vessels trading with the Americas. In 1731, [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]] claimed his ear was amputated by coast guard officers after they discovered contraband aboard his ship ''Rebecca''. Such incidents were seen as the cost of doing business and were forgotten after the easing of restrictions in 1732.{{sfn|Woodfine|1998|p=92}} Although an earless Jenkins was exhibited in the House of Commons, and war declared in 1739,&lt;ref name=&quot;Morison1965&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Eliot Morison|title=The Oxford History of the American People|url=https://archive.org/details/OxfordHistoryOfTheAmericanPeople|year=1965|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/OxfordHistoryOfTheAmericanPeople/page/n184 155]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the legend that his severed ear was shown to the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] has no basis in fact.{{sfn|Harbron|1998|p=3}}

Tensions increased after the founding of the British colony of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] in 1732, which Spain considered a threat to [[Spanish Florida]], vital to protect shipping routes with mainland Spain.{{sfn|Ibañez|2008|p=18}} For their part, the British viewed the 1733 ''[[Pacte de Famille]]'' between [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and his uncle [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] as the first step in being replaced by France as Spain's largest trading partner.{{sfn|McKay|1983|pages=138–140}}

A second round of &quot;depredations&quot; in 1738 led to demands for compensation, British newsletters and pamphlets presenting them as inspired by France.{{sfn|Mclachlan|1940|pp=94}} Linking these allowed the [[Tory]] opposition to imply failure to act was due to [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s concerns over exposing [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] to French attack. Resistance to European 'entanglements' was an ongoing theme in English politics, going back to the 17th century.{{sfn|Shinsuke|2013|pp=37–39}}

The January 1739 [[Convention of Pardo]] set up a Commission to resolve the Georgia-Florida boundary dispute and agreed Spain would pay damages of £95,000 for ships seized. In return, the South Sea Company would pay £68,000 to [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] as his share of profits on the ''asiento''. Despite being controlled by the government, the company refused and Walpole reluctantly accepted his political opponents wanted war.{{sfn|Woodfine|1998|p=204}}

On 10 July 1739, the [[Admiralty]] was authorised to begin naval operations against Spain and on 20th, a force under [[Edward Vernon|Admiral Vernon]] sailed for the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCOSP|Davies]], Documents 215, 215i&lt;/ref&gt; He reached [[Antigua]] in early October; on 22 October, British ships attacked [[La Guaira]], principal port of the [[Province of Venezuela]] and Britain formally declared war on 23 October 1739.{{sfn|Rodger|2005|p=238}}

The incident that gave its name to the war had occurred in 1731, off the coast of [[Florida]], when the British [[brig]] ''Rebecca'' was boarded by the Spanish [[patrol boat]] ''La Isabela'', commanded by the ''guarda costa'' (effectively privateer) Juan de León Fandiño. After boarding, Fandiño cut off the left ear of the ''Rebecca'''s captain, [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]], whom he accused of [[smuggling]] (although [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]]'s ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' for 7 October 1731, says it was Lieutenant Dorce).&lt;ref name=Graboyes/&gt; Fandiño told Jenkins, &quot;Go, and tell your King that I will do the same, if he dares to do the same.&quot; In March 1738, Jenkins was ordered to testify before Parliament, presumably to repeat his story before a committee of the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]]. According to some accounts, he produced the severed ear as part of his presentation, although no detailed record of the hearing exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/parliamentary-archives/archives-practical/archives-faqs/records-frequently-asked-questions/#jump-link-31 |title=I want...a record confirming that Robert Jenkins exhibited his severed ear to Parliament in 1738 (War of Jenkins' Ear) |work=U.K Parliament Archives: FAQ |accessdate=14 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504211438/http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/parliamentary-archives/archives-practical/archives-faqs/records-frequently-asked-questions/#jump-link-31 |archivedate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was considered alongside various other cases of &quot;Spanish Depredations upon the British Subjects&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=37802 |title=Second Parliament of George II:Fourth session (6 of 9, begins 15 March 1738)

The conflict was named by essayist and historian [[Thomas Carlyle]], in 1858, one hundred and ten years after hostilities ended. Carlyle mentioned the ear in several passages of his ''History of Friedrich II'' (1858), most notably in Book XI, chapter VI, where he refers specifically to &quot;the War of Jenkins's Ear&quot;.

==Conduct of the war==

===First attack on La Guaira (22 October 1739)===
{{See also|Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas}}
Vernon sent three ships commanded by Captain Thomas Waterhouse to intercept Spanish ships between [[La Guaira]] and [[Portobelo, Colón|Porto Bello]]. He decided to attack a number of vessels that he observed at [[La Guaira]], which was controlled by the [[Compañía Guipuzcoana de Caracas|Royal Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=4&amp;size=1&amp;id=gm.1739.10.x.9.x.x.551 &quot;Historical Chronicle&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923193138/http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=4&amp;size=1&amp;id=gm.1739.10.x.9.x.x.551 |date=23 September 2015 }}, ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', Saturday 23 October 1739, Vol. 9, October 1739, p. 551; accessed 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of the [[Province of Venezuela]], Brigadier Don [[:es:Gabriel José de Zuloaga Moyúa|Gabriel de Zuloaga]] had prepared the port defences, and Spanish troops were well-commanded by Captain Don Francisco Saucedo. On 22 October, Waterhouse entered the port of La Guaira flying the Spanish flag. Expecting attack, the port gunners were not deceived by his [[ruse of war|ruse]]; they waited until the British [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] was within range and then simultaneously opened fire. After three hours of heavy shelling, Waterhouse ordered a withdrawal. The battered British squadron sailed to Jamaica to undertake emergency repairs. Trying later to explain his actions, Waterhouse argued that the capture of a few small Spanish vessels would not have justified the loss of his men.

===Capture of Portobelo (20–22 November 1739)===

Prior to 1739, trade between mainland Spain and its colonies was conducted only through specific ports; twice a year, outward bound ships assembled in [[Cadiz]] and the ''Flota'' escorted to [[Portobelo, Panama|Portobelo]] or [[Veracruz]]. One way to impact Spanish trade was by attacking or blockading these ports but as many ships carried cargoes financed by foreign merchants, the strategy also risked damaging British and neutral interests.{{sfn|Lodge|1933|p=12}}

During the 1727 to 1729 [[Anglo-Spanish War (1727–1729)|Anglo-Spanish War]], the British attempted to take [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobelo]] but retreated after heavy losses from disease. On 22 November 1739, Vernon attacked the port with six [[ships of the line]]; it fell within twenty-four hours and the British occupied the town for three weeks before withdrawing, having first destroyed its fortifications, port and warehouses.{{sfn|Rodger|2005|p=236}}

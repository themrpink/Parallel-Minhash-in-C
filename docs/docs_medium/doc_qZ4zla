=== Climate ===

As with the rest of the [[British Isles]] and the Midlands, Coventry experiences a [[maritime climate]] with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is Coundon/Coventry Bablake. Temperature extremes recorded in Coventry range from {{convert|-18.2|C|F}} in February 1947, to {{convert|35.2|C|F}} in July 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Bablake Weather| url = http://www.bablakeweather.co.uk/2019-extremes| title = 2019 extremes in Coventry| accessdate = 27 July 2019| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190411124155/http://www.bablakeweather.co.uk/2019-extremes| archive-date = 11 April 2019| url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lowest temperature reading of recent years was {{convert|-10.8|C|F}} during December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = [[Met Office]]| url = http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/| title = 2010 temperature| access-date = 12 November 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120320225501/http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/| archive-date = 20 March 2012| url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Bablake Weather | url = http://bws.users.netlink.co.uk/last%20years%20stats.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070728111339/http://bws.users.netlink.co.uk/last%20years%20stats.htm | url-status = dead | archivedate = 28 July 2007 | title = 2010 temperature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City boundaries===

Coventry forms the largest part of the [[Coventry and Bedworth Urban Area]]. The city proper covers an area of almost 100&amp;nbsp;km square.

The protected [[West Midlands Green Belt]], which surrounds the city on all sides, has prevented the expansion of the city into both the administrative county of [[Warwickshire]] and the metropolitan borough of [[Solihull]] (the [[Meriden Gap]]), and has helped to prevent the coalescence of the city with surrounding towns such as [[Kenilworth]], [[Nuneaton]], [[Leamington Spa]], [[Warwick]], [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] and [[Balsall Common]].

===Places of interest===

====Cathedral====
[[File:Coventry Cathedral Ruins with Rainbow edit.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the old cathedral]]
[[Coventry Cathedral|St Michael's Cathedral]] is Coventry's best-known landmark and visitor attraction. The 14th&amp;nbsp;century church was largely destroyed by German bombing during the [[Second World War]], leaving only the outer walls and spire. At {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=off}} high, the spire of St Michael's is claimed to be the third tallest cathedral spire in England, after [[Salisbury Cathedral|Salisbury]] and [[Norwich Cathedral|Norwich]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Mee, The King's England – Warwickshire; Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the architectural design (in 1940 the tower had no internal wooden floors and a stone vault below the belfry) it survived the destruction of the rest of the cathedral. The new Coventry Cathedral was opened in 1962 next to the ruins of the old. It was designed by Sir [[Basil Spence]]. The cathedral contains the tapestry ''[[Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph]]'' by [[Graham Sutherland]]. The bronze statue ''[[St Michael's Victory over the Devil]]'' by [[Jacob Epstein]] is mounted on the exterior of the new cathedral near the entrance. [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]'', regarded by some as his masterpiece, was written for the opening of the new cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brittenpears.org/?page=britten/works/requiem.html Britten-Pears Foundation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194647/http://www.brittenpears.org/?page=britten%2Fworks%2Frequiem.html |date=23 September 2015 }} Retrieved 24 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral was featured in the 2009 film ''[[Nativity!]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nativity&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2009/10/23/nativity-movie-could-make-coventry-a-big-star-this-christmas-92746-24995014/|title=Nativity movie could make Coventry a big star this Christmas|newspaper=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|first=Marion|last=McMullen|date=23 October 2009|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spire of the ruined cathedral forms one of the ''&quot;three spires&quot;'' which have dominated the city skyline since the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, the others being those of [[Greyfriars, Coventry|Christ Church]] (of which only the spire survives) and [[Holy Trinity Church, Coventry|Holy Trinity Church]] (which is still in use).

Coventry Cathedral is also notable for being one of the newest [[cathedral]]s in the world, having been built following the Second World War bombing of the ancient cathedral by the Luftwaffe. Coventry has since developed an international reputation as one of Europe's major cities of peace and reconciliation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cov reconcil&quot;&gt;{{cite web

John Lennon and Yoko Ono planted two acorns outside the cathedral in June 1968 to thank the city for making friends with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2008/05/28/john_yoko_feature.shtml|title=Fifty acorns tied in a sack...|work=bbc.co.uk|access-date=18 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325195421/http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2008/05/28/john_yoko_feature.shtml|archive-date=25 March 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural institutions====
The [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]] is one of the largest cultural institutions in Coventry. Another visitor attraction in the city centre is [[Coventry Transport Museum]], which has the largest public collection of British-made road vehicles in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport-museum.com|title=Coventry Transport Museum|website=www.transport-museum.com|access-date=14 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906063348/http://www.transport-museum.com/|archive-date=6 September 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable exhibits are the world speed record-breaking cars, [[Thrust2]] and [[ThrustSSC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport-museum.com/visiting/biffa_award_land_speed_record_exhibition.aspx|title=Biffa Award Land Speed Record Exhibition - Coventry Transport Museum|website=www.transport-museum.com|access-date=14 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910075722/http://www.transport-museum.com/visiting/biffa_award_land_speed_record_exhibition.aspx|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum received a refurbishment in 2004 which included the creation of a new entrance as part of the city's Phoenix Initiative project. It was a finalist for the 2005 [[Gulbenkian Prize]]. The £5 million [[Fargo Village]] creative quarter shopping precinct was open in 2014 on Far Gosford Street with a mixture of retail units.

About {{convert|4|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the city centre and just outside Coventry in [[Baginton]] is the [[Lunt Fort]], a reconstructed [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort on its original site. The [[Midland Air Museum]] is situated just within the perimeter of Coventry on land adjacent to [[Coventry Airport]] and near [[Baginton]].

Coventry was one of the main centres of watchmaking during the 18th and 19th&amp;nbsp;centuries and as the industry declined, the skilled workers were key to setting up the cycle trade. A group of local enthusiasts founded a museum in [[Spon Street]].&lt;ref name=cwm/&gt;

[[File:West Midlands Police - Coventry Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Exhibits in Coventry Police Museum]]

The city's main [[police station]] in Little Park Street also hosts a museum of Coventry's police force. The museum, based underground, is split into two sections—one representing the history of the city's police force, and the other compiling some of the more unusual, interesting and grisly cases from the force's history. The museum is funded from charity donations—viewings can be made by appointment.

[[Hillfields#Coventry City Farm|Coventry City Farm]] was a small farm in an urban setting. It was mainly to educate city children who might not get out to the countryside very often. The farm closed in 2008 due to funding problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7291402.stm |title=City farm shuts after cash crisis |date=12 March 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2008 |work=BBC News Online |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321045232/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7291402.stm |archive-date=21 March 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

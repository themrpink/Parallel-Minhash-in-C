In [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Gujarat]], a very common convention among the Hindu communities is to have the patronymic as the middle name. Examples:

* Cricketer [[Sunil Gavaskar]]'s full name is Sunil Manohar Gavaskar, where Manohar is his father's given name. Sunil Gavaskar's son [[Rohan Gavaskar]] would be Rohan Sunil Gavaskar, and so on.
* Cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]]'s full name is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, where Ramesh is his father's given name.
* First Deputy Prime Minister and first Home Minister [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]]'s full name is Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, where Jhaverbhai is his father's given name.
* India's 15th Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], famously took oath of office as the Prime Minister of India as Narendra Damodardas Modi, where in Damodardas is his father's given name. He prefers to write his full name including his father's name as his middle name.

This system works for both boys and girls, except that after marriage, a woman takes her husband's given name as her middle name – her new middle name is no longer a patronymic.  [[Russian name|East Slavic naming customs]] are similar, except that the suffix ''-yevich'', ''-yevna'' or something similar is used in a [[Russian language]] patronymic. 

Indians, particularly [[Tamils]] in [[Singapore]], often continue the patronymic tradition; this entails having a single given name, followed by son / daughter of, followed by their father's name.

[[Malaysian Indians]] may also follow this custom with &quot;son&quot; or &quot;daughter&quot; of being replaced by &quot;anak lelaki&quot; or &quot;anak perempuan&quot;, respectively.

Indians of the [[Muslim]] [[Isma'ili]] [[Fiqh|sect]] also have patronymic middle names which use the father's first name and the grandfather's first name plus a family name. Someone called &quot;Ramazan Rahim Ali Manji&quot; might call his son &quot;Karim Ramazan Rahim Manji&quot; and his granddaughter might be called &quot;Zahra Karim Ramazan Manji&quot;.

===Southeast Asia===
In [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]], ethnic Malays and Indians generally follow the Arabic patronymic naming system of ''given name'' + bin/binti or SO/DO + ''father's name''.

In [[Brunei]], the ruling family of the monarch uses ''given name'' + ''ibni'' + ''father's name'' instead of using bin/binti.

In Indonesia, there are a number of ethnic groups with different naming systems. The [[Batak people|Batak]] of [[North Sumatra]] (Sumatra Utara) give every child the family's name. Sometimes the family's name is prefixed by Huta-, Batu-, etc., but most use Si-, such as Sitanggang, Sihombing, Sibutar-butar, Sinaga, or Sitohang. The family's name is given from the father's family. For example, if the father's name is Boggi Sinaga who married to Moetia Siregar then all children will be given family's name of Sinaga.

In Sunda a similar cultural rule is used to that of the Batak. The family's name for [[Sunda language|Sunda]] is -Wijaya, but this isn't true for all [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] families.

A common feature of historical Semitic names is the patronymic system. Since ancient times, men and women were referred to and named using this system. This was not limited to any certain region or religion. It was only in the 17th and 18th centuries, when laws were put in place in European nations demanding as much, that those of Semitic progeny began to abandon the patronymic naming scheme in favor of embracing consistent legal surnames. It was only after these laws were ratified that 99% of Jews and Muslims in these territories received surnames.

==== Jewish ====
{{details|Jewish name}}

[[Jew]]s have historically used [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] patronymic names after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], before which the most common language was [[Aramaic]]. In the Jewish patronymic system the first name is followed by either '''''ben-''''' or '''''bat-''''' (&quot;son of&quot; and &quot;daughter of&quot;, respectively), and then the father's name, mother's name, or both. In [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the first name was followed by '''''bar-''''' or '''''bat-''''' (&quot;son of&quot; and &quot;daughter of&quot;, respectively).

Permanent family surnames exist today, first by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]] in 10th or 11th century [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the late 18th century, when Austria passed the first law requiring Jews adopt surnames. Similar laws were passed in [[Prussia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], France, regions of Germany, and other countries.

While Jews now have permanent surnames for everyday life, the patronymic form is still used in religious life. It is used in [[synagogue]] and in documents in [[Halakha|Jewish law]] such as the [[ketubah]] (marriage contract). Many Sephardic Jews used the Arabic ''ibn'' instead of ''bat'' or ''ben'' when it was the norm. The Spanish family [[Ibn Ezra (disambiguation)|Ibn Ezra]] is one example.

There was strong cultural pressure during the period following the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] for [[Aliyah|immigrants]] to [[Israel|modern Israel]] to [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraize]] their names.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaganoff&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Jewish Names and Their History|author=Benzion C. Kaganoff|date= 1996-06-01|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781461627203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2IxzRvU_nwcC&amp;pg=PP2 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; 
This practice is especially common among Ashkenazic immigrants, because most of their names were taken during the period from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century. For example, [[Golda Meir]] was born &quot;Golda Mabovitch&quot;, took the name &quot;Golda Meyerson&quot; after her marriage to American Morris Meyerson, and, upon making [[Aliyah]] and at the urging of [[Moshe Sharett]], [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraized]] her last name to [[Meir (name)|Meir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Neil Caplan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 1956 Sinai Campaign Viewed from Asia: Selections from Moshe Sharett's Diaries|author=Neil Caplan|publisher=Indiana University Press|journal=Israel Studies|volume=7|number=1|date=Spring 2002|pages=81–103|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/is/summary/v007/7.1caplan.html|accessdate=June 3, 2014|doi=10.1353/is.2002.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arabic ====
{{See also|Arabic name#Nasab}}

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word &quot;[[Wiktionary:ibn|ibn]]&quot; ({{lang|ar|ابن}} or {{lang|ar|بن}}: &quot;bin&quot;, &quot;ben&quot; and sometimes &quot;ibni&quot; and &quot;ibnu&quot; to show the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Case|grammatical case]] of the noun) is the equivalent of the &quot;-son&quot; suffix discussed above. (The prefix ben- is used similarly in Hebrew.) In addition, &quot;[[Wiktionary:bint|bint]]&quot; ({{lang|ar|بنت}}) means &quot;daughter of&quot;. Thus, for example, &quot;Ali ibn `Amr&quot; means &quot;Ali son of `Amr&quot;. In Classical Arabic, the word ''ibn'' is written as ''bn'' between two names, since the case ending of the first name then supplies a vowel. Consequently, ibn is often written as &quot;b.&quot;, as bint is often written as &quot;bt.,&quot; in name formulas rendered from Arabic into Roman characters. Thus Hisham ibn al-Kalbi is alternatively written as Hisham b. al-Kalbi. However, the pronunciation &quot;bin&quot; is dialectal and has nothing to do with either the spelling or pronunciation in Classical Arabic. The word &quot;Abu&quot; (&quot;Aba&quot; or &quot;Abi&quot; in different grammatical cases) means &quot;father of&quot;, so &quot;Abu `Ali&quot; is another name for &quot;`Amr&quot;.

In medieval times, an [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate child]] of unknown parentage would sometimes be termed &quot;ibn Abihi&quot;, &quot;son of his father&quot; (notably [[Ziyad ibn Abihi]].) In the [[Qur'an]],  [[Jesus]] ([[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]] in Arabic) is consistently termed &quot;`Isa ibn Maryam&quot; - a [[matronymic]] (in the Qur'an, Jesus has no father; see [[Islamic view of Jesus]]). An Arabic patronymic can be extended as far back as family tree records will allow: thus, for example, [[Ibn Khaldun]] gives his own full name as &quot;`Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Jabir ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn `Abd ar-Rahman ibn Khaldun&quot;.

Patronymics are still standard in parts of the Arab world, notably [[Saudi Arabia]] and Iraq. (In the case of Iraq, with the omitted ibn or bint.) However, some of the Arab world has switched to a family name system.{{When|date=May 2015}}  As in English, the new family names are sometimes based on what was formerly a patronymic. The form most used in the Arab world is the usage of both the patronymic and a family name, often using both the father's and paternal grandfathers given name in sequence after the own given name, and then the family name. In [[Iraq]] for example, full names are formed by combining the given name of an individual with the given name of their father (sometimes the father is skipped and the paternal grandfather's given name is used instead, sometimes both father and paternal grandfather are used), along with the town, village, or clan name. For instance, Hayder Muhammed al-Tikriti is the son of Muhammed named Hayder, and he is from the town of [[Tikrit]]. In Saudi Arabia naming conventions are similar to Iraq's but family names are used much more often.

==== Aramaic ====
In [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the prefix '''''bar-''''' means &quot;son&quot; and is used as a prefix meaning &quot;son of&quot;. In the Bible, Peter is called Bar-Jonah in [[Matthew 16:17]] and Nathanael is possibly called Bartholomew because he is the son of Tolmai (or son of Ptolemy, with &quot;P&quot; being reduced). The titles can also be figurative, for example in [[Book of Acts|Acts]] 4:36-37 a man named Joseph is called [[Barnabas]] meaning &quot;son of consolation&quot;.

==== Assyrian ====
The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] for centuries have used the patronymic '''''bet''''' or '''''bit''''' literally meaning &quot;house&quot; in [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]; however, in the context of the name it means &quot;from the house of [the father's name].&quot;

==== Persian ====
In [[Persian language|Persian]], patronymics {{lang|fa|پَتوَند}} are formed by names ending with the suffix &quot;-pur&quot; {{lang|fa|پور}} for men and &quot;-dokht&quot; {{lang|fa|دُخت}} for women. For example: Shahpur (son of king) and Sinapur (son of Sina). Depending on country, some suffixes are more common than others. For example, in [[Iran]], the suffix &quot;-pur&quot; is common while in [[Afghanistan]], the suffix &quot;-Zadah&quot; {{lang|fa|زاده}} or &quot;-Zad&quot; {{lang|fa|زاد}} is common, although --[[Zadeh]] is common in Iran.

===Europe===
In Europe, patronyms were formerly widespread but later became confined to Scandinavia and Iceland.

====English====
In England, names ending with the suffix &quot;-son&quot; were often originally patronymic. In addition, the archaic [[French language|French]] (more specifically, [[Norman language|Norman]]) prefix ''fitz'' (cognate with the modern French ''[[wikt:fils|fils]]'', meaning &quot;son&quot;) appears in England's aristocratic family lines dating from the [[Norman Conquest]], and also among the [[Anglo-Irish]]. Thus there are names such as Fitzgerald and Fitzhugh. Of particular interest is the name &quot;Fitzroy&quot;, meaning &quot;son of [the] king&quot;, which was sometimes used by illegitimate royal children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-258669.html |title=Another Name Question [Archive&amp;#93; - Straight Dope Message Board |publisher=Boards.straightdope.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish, Scottish, and Manx====
{{See also|Irish name#Patronyms and other additives|Celtic onomastics#Surname prefixes}}

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}
The use of &quot;Mac&quot; in some form was prevalent in [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], in all of which it denotes &quot;son&quot;. &quot;Mc&quot; is also a frequent anglicisation in both Scotland and Ireland. In Ireland, the forms &quot;Mag&quot; and &quot;M'&quot; are encountered. The prefix &quot;Mac&quot; is used to form a patronym, such as &quot;Mac Coinnich&quot; – or the anglicized 'Mackenzie' – son of Coinneach/Kenneth. The female equivalent of ''Mac'' is ''Nic'', condensed from ''nighean mhic'' (in Scottish Gaelic) or ''iníon mhic'' (in Irish), both meaning daughter. For example, the Scottish Gaelic surname, ''Nic Dhòmhnaill'' meaning 'daughter of a son of Dòmhnall' (in English, Donald), as in ''Mairi Nic Dhòmhnaill'', or Mary MacDonald.

At the north end of the [[Irish Sea]], in [[Ulster]], the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Galloway]] (indeed as far north as [[Argyll]]), &quot;Mac&quot; was frequently truncated in speech to /k/, leading to such anglicisations as &quot;Qualtrough&quot; (Son of Walter) &amp; &quot;Quayle&quot; (son of Paul, cf. [[MacPhail (disambiguation)|MacPhail]]) – usually beginning with &quot;C&quot;, &quot;K&quot; or &quot;Q&quot;. In Ireland, this truncation resulted in surnames such as &quot;Guinness&quot; (son of Aonghus, cf. MacAonghusa) beginning usually in &quot;C&quot; or &quot;G&quot; for patronymics prefixed with Mac, and in &quot;H&quot; (e.g. &quot;Hurley&quot; (descendant of Iarlath, cf. Ua h-Iarfhlatha/O'Hurley)) for surnames prefixed with &quot;O&quot;. Colloquial Scottish Gaelic also has other patronymics of a slightly different form for individuals, still in use (for more information please see: [[Scottish Gaelic personal naming system]]).

====Welsh and Cornish====
{{anchor|Wales|Cornwall}}
{{see also|Welsh surnames|Cornish surnames}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Before the 1536 [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Act of Union]], the Welsh did not generally employ surnames, but instead used [[epithet]]s (e.g. [[Selyf Sarffgadau]], &quot;Selyf the Battle-Serpent&quot;), patronyms (e.g. [[Rhodri the Great|Rhodri ap Merfyn]], &quot;Rhodri son of Merfyn&quot;), and (much less often) matronyms (e.g. [[Rhodri the Great|Rhodri ap Nest]], &quot;Rhodri son of Nest&quot;) to identify people. Welsh, as a [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|P-Celtic language]], originally used ''map'' or ''mab'' instead of the [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|Q-Celtic]] ''mac'' employed in Ireland and Scotland. These were later simplified to the [[modern Welsh]] ''ap'' and ''ab''. A common practice is to use ''ab'' before a father's name beginning with a vowel (e.g., [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]]), but the two alternative forms are also employed arbitrarily in many sources.

Daughters were indicated by ''ferch'' or ''verch'' ([[Welsh language#mutation|mutated]] from ''merch'', &quot;girl, daughter&quot;). ''Angharad verch Owain'' would be &quot;Angharad, daughter of Owain&quot;.

After the Acts of Union, this led to many Welsh surnames being variants of their father or ancestor's personal name: ''ap'' or ''ab Ieuan'' often became &quot;Evans&quot;; ''ap Rhys'', &quot;Price&quot;; ''ap'' or ''ab Owain'', &quot;Bowen&quot;; ''ap Hywel'', &quot;Powell&quot; or &quot;Howell&quot;. In addition to these Anglicised baptismal and official names, patronyms continued to be commonly employed in Welsh until the [[Industrial Revolution]], particularly in the north and west of Wales. Patronyms were sometimes employed within the English names as well by using the father's personal name as the sons' [[middle name]].

Perhaps because [[Cornish surnames|Cornwall]] was legally incorporated into England earlier than Wales was, patronyms (e.g.[m]ap Ros&gt;Rouse, [m]ap Richard&gt;Pritchard, Davies, Evans) are less common there than [[Toponymic surname|toponyms]] (e.g. [[Tresillian]], Trevithick, [[Nankivell|Nanskeval/Nankeville]]) and occupational surnames (e.g. [[An Gof]], [An] Gove, ''([[Blacksmith]])''; Helyer (Cornish dialect - possibly a [[slater]] or [[Hunter|huntsman]] (helgher)).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kernow names&quot;&gt;[reepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~kernow/names_h.htm Rootsweb Ancestry.com - Kernow names]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dutch====
In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], patronymics were often used in place of [[family name]]s or as middle names. Patronymics were composed of the father's name plus an ending ''-zoon'' for sons, ''-dochter'' for daughters. For instance, [[Abel Tasman|Abel Janszoon Tasman]] is &quot;Abel son of Jan Tasman&quot;, and [[Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer]]: &quot;Kenau, daughter of Simon Hasselaer&quot;. In written form, these endings were often abbreviated as ''-sz.'' and ''-dr.'' respectively e.g. Jeroen Corneli'''sz'''. &quot;Jeroen son of Cornelis&quot;, or [[Dirck Jacobsz.|Dirck Jacobsz]]. The endings ''-s'', ''-se'' and ''-sen'' were also commonly used for sons and often for daughters too. In the northern provinces, ''-s'', as [[genitive case]], was almost universally used for both sons and daughters. The suffix -''x'' as in &quot;Tacx&quot; or &quot;Hendrix&quot; also denoted the son or daughter of..., and is now integrated as a complete name.

Patronymics were common in the Dutch [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] until the [[France|French]] invasion in 1795 and subsequent annexation in 1810. As the Netherlands were now a province of France, a registry of births, deaths and marriages was established in 1811, whereupon [[emperor]] [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] forced the Dutch to register and adopt a distinct surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.republikanisme.nl/naamgeving.html |title=Decreet van Naamsaanneming (Napoleon, 18 augustus 1811) |accessdate=2009-04-29 |language=Dutch |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912024314/http://www.republikanisme.nl/naamgeving.html |archivedate=2009-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====French====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In France, the terms ''patronyme'' and ''nom patronymique'' had long been used interchangeably to designate the family name, meaning that it is inherited from the father.

The tradition of patronymic lineage is still used among some Canadian descendants of French colonists: in the oral tradition of many [[Acadians]], for example, ''Marc à Pierre à Gérard'' (lit. &quot;Marc of Pierre of Gérard&quot;), means &quot;Marc, son of Pierre, grandson of Gérard&quot;.

====Iberian peninsula====
{{see also|Spanish naming customs|Portuguese naming customs}}
In the past, both in Spanish and Portuguese, the endings ''-ez'' and ''-es'' tended to be conflated since pronunciation was quite similar in the two languages. Today, Portuguese has been fully standardized to ''-es''; Spanish is also standardized to ''-ez'', but it is very common to see archaic endings in ''-es''. For instance, [[Pires (disambiguation)|Pires]]/[[Peres]] and [[Pérez]] are the modern equivalents of English &quot;[[Peterson (name)|Peterson]]&quot; in Portuguese and Spanish.

In [[Portugal]], there are some surnames which had a patronymic genesis, while still common they no longer indicate patronymic usage. For instance, ''Álvares'' was the son of ''Álvaro'' and ''Gonçalves'' was the son of ''Gonçalo'' (it was the case of [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]], son of Álvaro and Gonçalves Pereira, son of Gonçalo Pereira). Other cases include ''Rodrigues'' (''son of Rodrigo''), ''Nunes'' (''son of Nuno'') and ''Fernandes'' (''son of Fernando'').
In the same way the surname Soares means son of Soeiro (in Latin Suarius). It comes from Latin Suaricius (son of Suarius); the Latin [[genitive]] suffix ''-icius/a'' was used to indicate a patronymic. Later it became Suáriz, Suárez (both Spanish) and eventually Soares (Portuguese) . Another theory attributes the Iberian -ez style patronymics to Germanic (Visigothic) rather than Latin influence.&lt;ref name=port-names1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=port-names2 /&gt;

[[Spain|Spanish]] patronyms follow a similar pattern to the Portuguese (e.g., [[López]]: son of Lope; [[Fernández]]: son of Fernando; [[Hernández]]: son of Hernán; [[Rodríguez (surname)|Rodríguez]]: son of Rodrigo; [[Álvarez (surname)|Álvarez]]: son of Álvaro). Common endings include -ez, -az, -iz, -is and -oz. However, not all surnames with similar endings are necessarily patronymic. For example, Chávez is not the son of ''Chavo'', but comes from [[Galician language|Galician]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Chaves'', meaning &quot;keys&quot;, and its &quot;s&quot; stands for the plural form, as in key/keys in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kvs/heraldry/spanish16/ |title=16th Century Spanish Names |author=Elsbeth Anne Roth (Kathy Van Stone) |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science |date=2002 |accessdate=2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these kinds of surnames were unusual outside the [[Crown of Castile]]. Apart from natural spelling variations (such as using Giménez or Ximénez), language contact has brought a number of crossed versions, showing characteristics from multiple languages. It is possible to find the [[Catalan language]] politician Jordi Sànchez (who has a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] surname spelled the Catalan way) or the journalist Vicenç Sanchis (who has a Catalan surname spelled the Spanish way).

Due to the letters z and s being pronounced alike in [[Latin American|Latin America]] dialects of Spanish many non-patronymic surnames with an -es have come to be written with an -ez. In Hispano-American Spanish, the -ez spellings of [[Chávez (surname)|Chávez]] ([[Hugo Chávez]]), [[Cortes (surname)|Cortez]] ([[Alberto Cortez]]) and [[Valdez (surname)|Valdez]] ([[Nelson Valdez]]) are not patronymic surnames, but simply variant spellings of the Iberian Spanish spelling with -es, as in the names of [[Manuel Chaves (politician)|Manuel Chaves]], [[Hernán Cortés]] and [[Víctor Valdés]]. For more on the -z surnames in Spanish see [[Influences on the Spanish language]].

In Norse custom, patronyms and matronyms were formed by using the ending -son (later -søn and -sen in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[German language|German]]) to the [[genitive case|genitive]] form of the father's name to indicate “son of”, and -dóttir ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and Faroese -dóttir, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and Norwegian -dotter, Danish and Norwegian -datter) for &quot;daughter of&quot;. The resulting patronymic was generally not used as a surname; however a third name, a so-called byname based on location or personal characteristic, was often added to differentiate people and could eventually develop into a kind of [[family name]]. Some [[Early Modern]] examples of the latter practice, where the patronymic was placed after the given name and was followed by the surname, are Norwegian [[Peder Claussøn Friis]], the son of Nicolas Thorolfsen Friis (Claus in Claussøn being short for Nicolas) and Danish [[Thomas Kingo|Thomas Hansen Kingo]], the son of Hans Thomsen Kingo.

Eventually, most Nordic countries replaced or complemented this system with the prevailing &quot;international&quot; standard of inherited family names. In Norway, for example, the [[Storting|parliament]] passed a family name act in 1923, citing the rising population and the need to avoid the confusion of new last names in every generation. The law does allow a person to retain a patronymic as a [[middle name]] in addition to the surname, as was common in Early Modern times; this is not a common practice, but does occur, a modern example being [[Audhild Gregoriusdotter Rotevatn]]. The Danish government outlawed the practice in 1856 and eased the regulations in 1904 to deal with the limited number of patronymics. In Sweden the practice of children keeping their father's and wives taking their husband's patronymic as a surname occurred in the 18th century but was first prevalent in the late 19th century. Patronymics were normal in Sweden, at least in rural Sweden, until the 19th century. From the end of the 19th century patronymics gradually became less common in Sweden until they were abolished in 1966. In 1982 the right to use patronyms (and metronyms) was partially restored; a person (or the parents of a child) had to apply and pay a fee. 1 July 2017 parents in Sweden are free to give their children patronyms/matronyms at birth instead of inherited family names, and any person can change her or his last name to a metronymic or patronymic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=En ny lag om personnamn|url=http://www.regeringen.se/rattsdokument/lagradsremiss/2016/04/en-ny-lag-om-personnamn/|accessdate=21 April 2016|date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matronyms were used exceptionally if the child was born out of wedlock or if the mother was much more high-born or well known than the father, a historical example being [[Sweyn Estridsson]].

[[Icelandic name|In Iceland]], patronymics or matronymics are still used as last names and this is in fact compulsory by law, with a handful of exceptions. The father's name (usually in the genitive case) plus the word ''son'' for sons, ''dóttir'' for daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;namelaw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/lagas/135a/1996045.html|title=Lög um mannanöfn |author=Alþingi Íslands|accessdate=2008-04-02|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] (i.e. &quot;Jóhanna, daughter of Sigurð[ur]&quot;).

====Finnish====

In [[Finland]], the use of patronymics was a result of relatively recent Swedish influence and remained uncommon outside official documents. Only in the 19th century did the use of patronymics gain any sort of popularity among the [[Finnish language|Finnish-speaking]] lower classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;paikkala&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paikkala|first1=Sirkka|title=Patronyymit ja matronyymit sukututkimuksissa|url=http://www.genealogia.fi/nimet/nimi16s.htm|website=genealogia.fi|publisher=Suomen Sukututkimusseura|accessdate=2 August 2015|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family names became obligatory in Finland by law in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fi:Nimilaki]]{{Better source|date=June 2017|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, patronymics were composed in Swedish fashion: the father's name and the suffix -n for genitive plus the word ''poika'' for sons, ''tytär'' for daughters. For example, Tuomas Abrahaminpoika (to be read in English as &quot;Tuomas, Abraham's son&quot;) and Martta Heikintytär (to be read in English as &quot;Martta, Heikki's daughter&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;paikkala&quot; /&gt;

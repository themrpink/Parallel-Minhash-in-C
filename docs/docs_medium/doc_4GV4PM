===Computer security===
{{Main|Computer security}}
[[Computer security]], also known as cybersecurity or IT security, refers to the security of computing devices such as [[computer]]s and smartphones, as well as [[computer network]]s such as private and public networks, and the [[Internet access|Internet]]. The field has growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems in most societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/technology/opinion/reliance-spells-end-of-road-for-ict-amateurs/story-e6frgb0o-1226636267865?nk=34fe4ab684629535daaf6a8fe6e6ef3d &quot;Reliance spells end of road for ICT amateurs&quot;], May 07, 2013, The Australian&lt;/ref&gt; It concerns the protection of hardware, software, data, people, and also the procedures by which systems are accessed. The means of computer security include the [[physical security]] of systems and [[information security|security of information]] held on them.

=== Corporate security ===
{{Main|Corporate security}}
Corporate security refers to the resilience of [[corporation]]s against [[espionage]], theft, damage, and other threats. The security of corporations has become more complex as reliance on IT systems has increased, and their physical presence has become more highly distributed across several countries, including environments that are, or may rapidly become, hostile to them.[[File:Delta World HQ - entrance with security station.JPG|thumb|Security checkpoint at the entrance to the [[Delta Air Lines]] [[corporate headquarters]] in [[Atlanta]]]]

[[File:Mall culture jakarta94.jpg|thumb|Security checkpoint at the entrance to a [[shopping mall]] in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]

=== Ecological security ===
{{Main|Environmental security}}
Ecological security, also known as environmental security, refers to the integrity of [[ecosystem]]s and the [[biosphere]], particularly in relation to their capacity to sustain a [[Biodiversity|diversity of life-forms]] (including human life). The security of ecosystems has attracted greater attention as the impact of ecological damage by humans has grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/65/161|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 2010|last=United Nations General Assembly|date=2010|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Graffiti about environmental security.jpg|thumb|[[Graffiti]] about [[Environmental security|ecological security]], [[Belarus]], 2016]]

=== Food security ===
{{Main|Food security}}
Food security refers to the ready supply of, and access to, safe and [[Nutrition|nutritious]] food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|title=Hunger and food security|last=United Nations|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food security is gaining in importance as the world's population has grown and productive land has diminished through overuse and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/209369/icode/|title=Greater focus on soil health needed to feed a hungry planet|last=Food and Agriculture Organization|date=2013|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/|title=Only 60 Years of Farming Left If Soil Degradation Continues|last=Arsenault|first=C|date=2014|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GLOBAL WARMING AFFECTING GLOBAL AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY.pdf|thumb|[[Climate change]] is affecting global [[agriculture]] and [[food security]]]]

=== Home security ===
{{Main|Home security}}
Home security normally refers to the security systems used on a property used as a dwelling (commonly including doors, locks, alarm systems, lighting, fencing); and personal security practices (such as ensuring doors are locked, alarms activated, windows closed etc.)[[File:Security spikes 1.jpg|thumb|Security spikes protect a [[gated community]] in the [[East End of London]].]]

=== Human security ===
{{Main|Human security}}
[[File:War in Gaza 018 - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|Boys play among the bombed-out ruins of [[Gaza City]], 2009]]
Human security is the name of an emerging [[paradigm]] which, in response to traditional emphasis on the right of nation states to protect themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/index.html|title=Charter of the United Nations, Chapter VII|last=United Nations|date=1945|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; has focused on the primacy of the security of people (individuals and communities).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/humansecurity/|title=UN Trust Fund for Human Security|last=United Nations|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is supported by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], which has stressed &quot;the right of people to live in [[freedom]] and [[dignity]]&quot; and recognized &quot;that all individuals, in particular vulnerable people, are entitled to [[freedom from fear]] and [[freedom from want]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/docs/idrl/I520EN.pdf|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly 60/1: World Summit Outcome|last=United Nations General Assembly|date=2005|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National security ===
{{Main|National security}}
National security refers to the security of a [[nation state]], including its people, economy, and institutions. In practice, state governments rely on a wide range of means, including [[diplomacy]], [[economic power]], and [[Military|military capabilities]].

== Perceptions of security ==
Since it is not possible to know with precision the extent to which something is 'secure' (and a measure of vulnerability is unavoidable), perceptions of security vary, often greatly.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; For example, a fear of death by earthquake is common in the United States (US), but slipping on the bathroom floor kills more people;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;Bruce Schneier, ''Beyond Fear: Thinking about Security in an Uncertain World'', Copernicus Books, pages 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; and in France, the United Kingdom and the US there are far fewer deaths caused by [[terrorism]] than there are women killed by their partners in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/report-terrorism-acts-2011.pdf|title=The Terrorism Acts in 2011|last=David Anderson QC|date=2012|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.womensaid.org.uk/what-is-femicide/|title=What is femicide?|last=Womens Aid|work=Womens Aid|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upworthy.com/dont-believe-in-the-war-on-women-would-a-body-count-change-your-mind|title=Don't Believe In The War On Women? Would A Body Count Change Your Mind?|work=Upworthy|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2015/06/11/violences-conjugales-118-femmes-tuees-en-2014_1327822|title=Violences conjugales: 118 femmes tuées en 2014|work=Libération.fr|access-date=2017-12-17|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem of perception is the common assumption that the mere presence of a security system (such as [[Military|armed forces]], or [[antivirus software]]) implies security. For example, two [[computer security]] programs installed on the same device can prevent each other from working properly, while the user assumes that he or she benefits from twice the protection that only one program would afford.

[[Security theater]] is a critical term for measures that change perceptions of security without necessarily affecting security itself. For example, visual signs of security protections, such as a home that advertises its alarm system, may deter an [[Trespasser|intruder]], whether or not the system functions properly. Similarly, the [[Security increase|increased presence of military personnel]] on the streets of a city after a [[Terrorism|terrorist attack]] may help to reassure the public, whether or not it diminishes the risk of further attacks.

==Security concepts (examples)==
Certain concepts recur throughout different fields of security:
* [[Access control]] - the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource.
* [[Assurance services|Assurance]] - an expression of confidence that a security measure will perform as expected.
* [[Authorization]] - the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources related to information security and computer security in general and to access control in particular.
* [[Countermeasure]] - a means of preventing an act or system from having its intended effect.
* [[Defense in depth]] - a school of thought holding that a wider range of security measures will enhance security.
* [[Exploit (computer security)|Exploit]] (noun) - a means of capitalizing on a vulnerability in a security system (usually a cyber-security system).
* [[Identity management]] - enables the right individuals to access the right resources at the right times and for the right reasons.
* [[Resilience (organizational)|Resilience]] - the degree to which a person, community, nation or system is able to resist adverse external forces.
* [[Risk]] - a possible event which could lead to damage, harm, or loss.
* [[Security management]] - identification of an organization's assets (including people, buildings, machines, systems and information assets), followed by the development, documentation, and implementation of policies and procedures for protecting these assets.
* [[Threat]] - a potential source of harm.
* [[Vulnerability]] - the degree to which something may be changed (usually in an unwanted manner) by external forces.

In [[telecommunication]], the term '''security kernel''' has the following meanings: 

#In [[computer]] and [[communications security]], the central part of a computer or [[communications system]] [[computer hardware|hardware]], [[firmware]], and [[software]] that implements the basic security procedures for controlling [[Access control|access]] to system resources. 
#A self-contained usually small collection of key security-related statements that (a) works as a part of an [[operating system]] to prevent unauthorized access to, or use of, the system and (b) contains criteria that must be met before specified programs can be accessed. 
#Hardware, firmware, and software elements of a [[trusted computing base]] that implement the [[reference monitor]] concept.

'''Security management''' is the identification of an organization's [[asset]]s (including people, buildings, machines, systems and [[Asset (computer security)|information assets]]), followed by the development, documentation, and implementation of policies and procedures for protecting assets.

An organization uses such security management procedures for [[information classification]], threat assessment, [[risk assessment]], and [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] to identify threats, categorize assets, and rate system vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/by-need-security-management.aspx|title=Manage IT Security Risk with a Human Element |publisher=Dell.com |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss prevention==
{{main|Loss prevention}}
Loss prevention focuses on what one's critical assets are and how they are going to protect them. A key component to [[loss prevention]] is assessing the potential threats to the successful achievement of the goal. This must include the potential opportunities that further the object (why take the risk unless there's an upside?) Balance probability and impact determine and implement measures to minimize or eliminate those threats.&lt;ref&gt;https://losspreventionmedia.com/from-security-to-loss-prevention-to-retail-asset-protection-to-profit-enhancement/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security risk management==
The management of [[security risk]]s applies the principles of risk management to the management of security threats. It consists of identifying threats (or risk causes), assessing the effectiveness of existing controls to face those threats, determining the risks' consequence(s), prioritizing the risks by rating the likelihood and impact, classifying the type of risk, and selecting an appropriate risk option or risk response. In 2016, a universal standard for managing risks was developed in The Netherlands. In 2017, it was updated and named: Universal Security Management Systems Standard 2017.

===Types of risks===

====External====
* Strategic: Competition and customer demand.
* Operational: Regulations, suppliers, and contract.
* Financial: FX and credit.
* Hazard: Natural disasters, cyber, and external criminal acts.
* Compliance: New regulatory or legal requirements are introduced, or existing ones are changed, exposing the organization to a non-compliance risk if measures are not taken to ensure compliance.

====Internal====
* Strategic: R&amp;D.
* Operational: Systems and processes (H&amp;R, Payroll).
* Financial: Liquidity and cash flow.
* Hazard: Safety and security; employees and equipment.
* Compliance: Concrete or potential changes in an organization's systems, processes, suppliers, etc. may create exposure to a legal or regulatory non-compliance.

===Risk options===

====Risk avoidance====
The first choice to be considered is the possibility of eliminating the existence of criminal opportunity or avoiding the creation of such an opportunity. When additional considerations or factors are not created as a result of this action that would create a greater risk. For example, removing all the cash flow from a [[retail]] outlet would eliminate the opportunity for stealing the money, but it would also eliminate the ability to conduct business.

====Risk reduction====
When avoiding or eliminating the criminal opportunity conflicts with the ability to conduct business, the next step is reducing the opportunity of potential loss to the lowest level consistent with the function of the business. In the example above, the application of risk reduction might result in the business keeping only enough cash on hand for one day's operation.

====Risk spreading====
Assets that remain exposed after the application of reduction and avoidance are the subjects of risk spreading. This is the concept that limits loss or potential losses by exposing the perpetrator to the probability of detection and apprehension prior to the consummation of the crime through the application of perimeter lighting, barred windows, and intrusion detection systems. The idea is to reduce the time available for thieves to steal assets and escape without apprehension.

====Risk transfer====
The two primary methods of accomplishing risk transfer is to insure the assets or raise prices to cover the loss in the event of a criminal act. Generally speaking, when the first three steps have been properly applied, the cost of transferring risks is much lower.

====Risk acceptance====
All of the remaining risks must simply be assumed by the business as a part of doing business. Included with these accepted losses are deductibles, which have been made as part of the insurance coverage.

==Security policy implementations==

===Intrusion detection===
* [[Alarm device]].

===Access control===
* [[Lock (security device)|Locks]], simple or sophisticated, such as [[biometric authentication]] and [[keycard lock]]s.

===Physical security===

{{Short description|Type of code in coding theory}}
{{Use mdy dates|date = March 2019}}
{{distinguish|self-clocking signal}}
In [[coding theory]], especially in [[telecommunication]]s, a '''self-synchronizing code''' is a [[uniquely decodable code]] in which the [[symbol (data)|symbol]] stream formed by a portion of one [[code word]], or by the overlapped portion of any two adjacent code words, is not a valid code word.&lt;ref&gt;https://glossary.atis.org/glossary/self-synchronizing-code/?char=S&amp;page_number=22&amp;sort=ASC&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, a set of strings (called &quot;code words&quot;) over an alphabet is called a self-synchronizing code if for each string obtained by concatenating two code words, the substring starting at the second symbol and ending at the second-last symbol does not contain any code word as substring. Every self-synchronizing code is a [[prefix code]], but not all prefix codes are self-synchronizing.

Other terms for self-synchronizing code are '''synchronized code'''&lt;ref name=BPR137&gt;Berstel et al (2010) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; or, ambiguously, '''comma-free code'''.&lt;ref&gt;Berstel &amp; Perrin (1985) p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; A self-synchronizing code permits the proper [[frame synchronization|framing]] of transmitted code words provided that no uncorrected errors occur in the [[data stream|symbol stream]]; external [[synchronization]] is not required. Self-synchronizing codes also allow recovery from uncorrected errors in the stream; with most prefix codes, an uncorrected error in a single [[bit]] may propagate errors further in the stream and make the subsequent data [[data corruption|corrupted]].

Importance of self-synchronizing codes is not limited to [[data transmission]]. Self-synchronization also facilitates some cases of [[data recovery]], for example of a [[character encoding|digitally encoded text]].

==Examples==
* The prefix code {00, 11} is self-synchronizing because 0, 1, 01 and 10 are not codes.
* [[UTF-8]] is self-synchronizing because its leading (&lt;code&gt;11xxxxxx&lt;/code&gt;) and trailing (&lt;code&gt;10xxxxxx&lt;/code&gt;) bytes have different bit patterns.
* [[High-Level Data Link Control]] (HDLC)
* [[Advanced Data Communication Control Procedures]] (ADCCP)
* [[Fibonacci coding]]

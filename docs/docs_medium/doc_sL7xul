The core of the school (which contains School House, featured in ''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'') was completed in 1815 and is built around the Old Quad (quadrangle), with its Georgian architecture. Especially notable rooms are the Upper Bench (an intimate space with a book-lined gallery), the Old Hall of School House, and the Old Big School (which makes up one side of the quadrangle and was once the location for teaching all junior pupils).  [[Thomas Hughes]] (like his fictional hero, Tom Brown) once carved his name on the hands of the school clock, situated on a tower above the Old Quad. The polychromatic school chapel, new quadrangle, Temple Reading Room, Macready Theatre and Gymnasium were designed by well-known [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Gothic revival]] architect [[William Butterfield]] in 1875, and the smaller Memorial Chapel was dedicated in 1922.

The Temple Speech Room, named after former headmaster and Archbishop of Canterbury [[Frederick Temple]] (1858–69) is now used for whole-school assemblies, speech days, concerts, musicals – and BBC Mastermind. Between the wars, the Memorial Chapel, the Music Schools and a new Sanatorium appeared.

By the twentieth century Rugby expanded and new buildings were built inspired by this Edwardian Era. The Temple Speech Room, named after former headmaster and Archbishop of Canterbury [[Frederick Temple]] (1858–69) and now used for whole-School assemblies, speech days, concerts, musicals – and BBC ''Mastermind''. Oak-panelled walls boast the portraits of illustrious alumni, including Neville Chamberlain holding his piece of paper. Between the wars, the Memorial Chapel, the Music Schools and a new Sanatorium appeared.&lt;ref&gt;rugbyschool.net/history&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 two girls were admitted to the sixth form, and the first girls’ house opened three years later, followed by three more. In 1992, the first 13-year-old girls arrived, and in 1995 Rugby had its first-ever Head Girl, Louise Woolcock, who appeared on the front page of ''The Times''. In September 2003 a last girls’ house was added. Today, total enrolment of day pupils, from forms 4 to 12, numbers around 800.&lt;ref name=&quot;prepreview.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Oxford student|title=Rugby School|url=http://www.prepreview.com/school/Rugby_School.html|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby football==
[[File:WWEplaque 700.jpg|thumb|left|William Webb Ellis plaque]]
[[File:Webb-Ellis-at-Rugby,.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Webb Ellis at Rugby, 1823]]
The game of [[Rugby football]] owes its name to the school. 

The legend of [[William Webb Ellis]] and the origin of the game is commemorated by a plaque. The story that Webb Ellis was the first to pick up a football and run with it, and thus invented a new sport, has been known to be a myth since it was investigated by the Old Rugbeian Society in 1895. 

There were no standard rules for football in Webb Ellis's time at Rugby (1816–1825) and most varieties involved carrying the ball. The games played at Rugby were organised by the pupils and not the masters, the rules being a matter of custom and not written down. They were frequently changed and modified with each new intake of students. 

The sole source of the story is [[Matthew Bloxam]], a former pupil but not a contemporary of Webb Ellis. In October 1876, four years after the death of Webb Ellis, in a letter to the school newspaper ''The Meteor'' he quotes an unknown friend relating the story to him. He elaborated on the story four years later in another letter to ''The Meteor'', but shed no further light on its source. [[Richard Lindon]], a boot and shoemaker who had premises across the street from the School's main entrance in Lawrence Sheriff Street, is credited with the invention of the &quot;oval&quot; rugby ball, the rubber inflatable bladder and the brass hand pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardlindon.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311213720/http://www.richardlindon.com/|url-status = dead|archive-date=11 March 2007|title=richardlindon.com|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rugby Fives ==
[[File:Rugby Fives.jpeg|thumb|right|Rugby Fives]]

[[Rugby Fives]] is a [[Gaelic handball|handball]] game, similar to [[squash (sport)|squash]], played in an enclosed court. It has similarities with [[Winchester Fives]] (a form of Wessex Fives) and [[Eton Fives]].

It is most commonly believed to be derived from Wessex Fives, a game played by [[Thomas Arnold]], Headmaster of Rugby, who had played Wessex Fives when a boy at Lord Weymouth's Grammar, now [[Warminster School]]. The open court of Wessex Fives, built in 1787, is still in existence at [[Warminster School]] although it has fallen out of regular use.

[[Rugby Fives]] is played between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles), the aim being to hit the ball above a 'bar' across the front wall in such a way that the opposition cannot return it before a second bounce. The ball is slightly larger than a [[golf]] ball, leather-coated and hard. Players wear leather padded gloves on both hands, with which they hit the ball.

[[Rugby Fives]] continues to have a good following with tournaments being run nationwide, presided over by the Rugby Fives Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruby Fives Association|url=http://www.rfa.org.uk/about.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==
[[File:Rugby - Rugby School - geograph.org.uk - 158546.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the cricket ground at Rugby School]]
The school has produced a number of cricketers who have gone onto play [[Test cricket|Test]] and [[first-class cricket]]. The school has played host to two major matches, the first of which was a [[Twenty20]] match between [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] and [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in the [[2013 Friends Life t20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/2005_tt.html|title=Twenty20 Matches played on Rugby School Ground, Rugby |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2020-10-20 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second match was a [[List A cricket|List-A one-day match]] between [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] and [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] in the [[2015 Royal London One-Day Cup]], though it was due to host a match in the [[2014 Royal London One-Day Cup|2014 comptition]], however this was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/2005_a.html |title=List A Matches played on Rugby School Ground, Rugby |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2020-10-20 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 match, [[William Porterfield]] scored a [[century (cricket)|century]], with a score of exactly 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/2005/a_Centuries.html |title=Rugby School Ground, Rugby - Centuries in List A matches |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2020-10-20 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Houses ==
Rugby School has both day and boarding-pupils, the latter in the majority. Originally it was for boys only, but girls have been admitted to the [[sixth form]] since 1975. It went fully co-educational in 1992. The school community is divided into [[House system|houses]].

== Academic life ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}

Pupils beginning Rugby in the F Block (first year) study various subjects. In a pupil's second year (E block), they do nine subjects which are for their GCSEs, this is the same for the D Block (GCSE year). The school then provides standard [[A-levels]] in 29 subjects. Students at this stage have the choice of taking three or four subjects and are also offered the opportunity to take an extended project.  [[Oxbridge]] acceptance percentage in 2007 was&amp;nbsp;10.4% &lt;ref&gt;http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Education/documents/2007/09/20/100topoxbridge.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarships===
The [[School governor|Governing Body]] provides financial benefits with school fees to families unable to afford them. Parents of pupils who are given a Scholarship are capable of obtaining a 10% fee deduction, although more than one scholarship can be awarded to one student.

The Rugbeian Society is for former pupils at the School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugsoc.com|title=Rugby School – (Development Office)|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Old Rugbeian is sometimes referred to as an OR.

The purposes of the society are to encourage and help Rugbeians in interacting with each other and to strengthen the ties between ORs and the school.

In 2010 the Rugbeians reached the semi-finals of the Public Schools' Old Boys' Sevens tournament, hosted by the Old Silhillians to celebrate the 450th anniversary of fellow Warwickshire public school, [[Solihull School]].

===Dr Thomas Arnold===
{{Main|Thomas Arnold}}
[[File:Rugby_School_-_ex_libris.tif|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Bookplate|Ex libris]] from Rugby School. From [[Biblioteca europea di informazione e cultura|BEIC]]]]
Rugby's most famous headmaster was Dr Thomas Arnold, appointed in 1828; he executed many reforms to the school curriculum and administration. Arnold's and the school's reputations were immortalised through [[Thomas Hughes]]' book ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]].''

David Newsome writes about the new educational methods employed by Arnold in his book, 'Godliness and Good Learning' (Cassell 1961). He calls the morality practised at Arnold's school [[muscular Christianity]]. Arnold had three principles: religious and moral principle, gentlemanly conduct and academic performance. Dr George Mosse, former professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, lectured on Arnold's time at Rugby. According to Mosse, Thomas Arnold created an institution which fused religious and moral principles, gentlemanly conduct, and learning based on self-discipline. These morals were socially enforced through the &quot;Gospel of work.&quot; The object of education was to produce &quot;the Christian gentleman,&quot; a man with good outward appearance, playful but earnest, industrious, manly, honest, virginal pure, innocent, and responsible.

===John Percival===
{{Main|John Percival (bishop)}}
In 1888 the appointment of [[Marie Bethell Beauclerc]] by Percival was the first appointment of a female teacher in an English boys' public school and the first time [[shorthand]] had been taught in any such school. The shorthand course was popular with one hundred boys in the classes.

== Controversy ==
In September 2005, the school was one of fifty independent schools operating [[Independent school fee fixing scandal|independent school fee-fixing]], in breach of the [[Competition Act 1998|Competition Act, 1998]]. All of the schools involved were ordered to abandon this practice, pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 each and to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information had been shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Halpin|first=Halpin|title=Independent schools face huge fines over cartel to fix fees|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/independent-schools-face-huge-fines-over-cartel-to-fix-fees-rcwcznjnvnt|access-date=2020-02-29|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=21 December 2006|title=Office of Fair Trading Press Release|url=https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100402135855tf_/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/182-06|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=29 Feb 2020|website=National Ara chive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

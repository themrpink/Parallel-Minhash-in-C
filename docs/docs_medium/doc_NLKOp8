In [[telecommunication]], a '''medium-power talker''' is a hypothetical talker, within a [[log-normal distribution]] of talkers, whose volume lies at the [[Average|medium]] [[Power (physics)|power]] of all talkers determining the volume distribution at the point of interest.  

When the distribution follows a log-normal curve (values expressed in decibels), the mean and standard deviation can be used to compute the medium-power talker. The talker volume distribution follows a log-normal curve and the medium-power talker is uniquely determined by the average talker volume. The medium-power talker volume, ''V'', is given by ''V'' = ''V'' &lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.115σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''V'' &lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the average of the talker volume distribution in volume units (vu), and σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[variance]] of the distribution.

&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30091872/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/dashboards-meet-st-century/|title=Dashboards meet the 21st century|last=contributor|first=Dan Carney msnbc com|date=2009-04-08|website=msnbc.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;A '''message''' is a discrete unit of [[communication]] intended by the [[communication source|source]] for consumption by some recipient or group of recipients.  A message may be delivered by various means, including [[courier]], [[telegraphy]], [[carrier pigeon]] and [[Bus (computing)|electronic bus]].
A message can be the content of a [[broadcasting|broadcast]].  An [[interactive]]
exchange of messages forms a [[conversation]].

One example of a message is a '''communiqué''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|m|juː|n|ɪ|k|eɪ}}), which is a brief report or statement released by a public agency.

== Roles in human communication ==

In communication between humans, messages can be verbal or [[nonverbal]]:

* A verbal message is an exchange of information using words. Examples include face-to-face communication, telephone calls, voicemails, etc.
* A nonverbal message is communicated through actions or behaviors rather than words, e.g. by the use of [[body language]].

== In computer science ==

There are two main senses of the word &quot;message&quot; in [[computing]]:  messages between the human users of [[computer]] systems that are delivered by those computer systems, and [[Event (computing)|messages]] passed between programs or between components of a [[Single transferable vote|single]] program, for their own purposes.

* [[Instant messaging]] and [[e-mail|emails]] are examples of computer software designed for delivering human-readable messages in formatted or unformatted text, from one person to another.
* [[Message passing]] is a form of communication used in concurrent and [[parallel computing]], object-oriented programming, and  [[interprocess communication|channel communicate]] , where communication is made by sending messages to recipients. In a related use of this sense of a message, in [[object-oriented programming language]] such as main library [&quot;msg&quot; box][[Smalltalk]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], a ''message'' is sent to an [[Object (computer science)|object]], specifying a ''request'' for action.

=== Safety and privacy concerns ===
Because computers are automated, and they do not require human interaction to do something, there have been many safety and privacy concerns in many areas of the computer science industry regarding messages.  There have been many cases where instant messaging apps were found to be at risk for spyware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/011119/hyderabad-whatsapp-is-vulnerable-to-spyware-attacks.html|title=Hyderabad: WhatsApp is vulnerable to spyware attacks|last=Sunku|first=Durgaprasad|date=2019-11-01|website=Deccan Chronicle|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These concerns are not just limited to cellphones, laptops, desktops, or devices of the like.  Some of these concerns even point towards displays in car dashboards, where these device are as smart as smartphones, however can be prone to attacks and is known that auto manufacturers have little to no regulations to follow when putting these devices in car dashboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-displays-safety-insight-idUSKCN0PH0BO20150707|title=Car dashboards that act like smart phones raise safety issues|date=2015-07-07|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also has been found by research that car information displays on dashboards can be distracting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://13wham.com/news/local/research-shows-car-dashboard-technology-is-distracting-especially-to-older-drivers|title=Research shows car dashboard technology is distracting, especially to older drivers|last=Staff|first=Antoinette DelBel, WHAM|date=2019-07-25|website=WHAM|access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[combinatorial game theory]], the '''Sprague&amp;ndash;Grundy theorem''' states that every [[impartial game]] under the [[normal play convention]] is equivalent to a one-heap game of [[nim]], or to an infinite generalization of nim. It can therefore be represented as a [[natural number]], the size of the heap in its equivalent game of nim, as an [[ordinal number]] in the infinite generalization, or alternatively as a [[nimber]], the value of that one-heap game in an algebraic system whose addition operation combines multiple heaps to form a single equivalent heap in nim.

The '''Grundy value''' or '''nim-value''' of any impartial game is the unique nimber that the game is equivalent to.  In the case of a game whose positions are indexed by the natural numbers (like nim itself, which is indexed by its heap sizes), the sequence of nimbers for successive positions of the game is called the '''nim-sequence''' of the game.

The Sprague–Grundy theorem and its proof encapsulate the main results of a theory discovered independently by [[Roland Sprague|R. P. Sprague]] (1935)&lt;ref name = &quot;SpraguePaper&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Definitions==
For the purposes of the Sprague&amp;ndash;Grundy theorem, a '''''game''''' is a two-player [[sequential game]] of [[perfect information]] satisfying the ''ending condition'' (all games come to an end: there are no infinite lines of play) and the ''normal play condition'' (a player who cannot move loses).

At any given point in the game, a player's '''''position''''' is the set of '''''moves''''' they are allowed to make.  As an example, we can define the ''zero game'' to be the two-player game where neither player has any legal moves.  Referring to the two players as &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (for Alice) and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (for Bob), we would denote their positions as &lt;math&gt;(A, B) = (\{\}, \{\})&lt;/math&gt;, since the set of moves each player can make is empty.

An '''''[[impartial game]]''''' is one in which at any given point in the game, each player is allowed exactly the same set of moves. Normal-play [[nim]] is an example of an impartial game. In nim, there are one or more heaps of objects, and two players (we'll call them Alice and Bob), take turns choosing a heap and removing 1 or more objects from it. The winner is the player who removes the final object from the final heap.  The game is '''''impartial''''' because for any given configuration of pile sizes, the moves Alice can make on her turn are exactly the same moves Bob would be allowed to make if it were his turn.  In contrast, a game such as [[checkers]] is not impartial because, supposing Alice were playing red and Bob were playing black, for any given arrangement of pieces on the board, if it were Alice's turn, she would only be allowed to move the red pieces, and if it were Bob's turn, he would only be allowed to move the black pieces.

Note that any configuration of an impartial game can therefore be written as a single position, because the moves will be the same no matter whose turn it is. For example, the position of the ''zero game'' can simply be written &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;, because if it's Alice's turn, she has no moves to make, and if it's Bob's turn, he has no moves to make either.
A move can be associated with the position it leaves the next player in. 

Doing so allows positions to be defined recursively.  For example, consider the following game of Nim played by Alice and Bob.

=== {{anchor|firstExample}}Example Nim Game ===
{{Pre|
 Sizes of heaps  Moves
 A B C
 &amp;nbsp;
 1 2 2           Alice takes 1 from A
 0 2 2           Bob   takes 1 from B 
 0 1 2           Alice takes 1 from C 
 0 1 1           Bob   takes 1 from B 
 0 0 1           Alice takes 1 from C
 0 0 0           Bob   has no moves, so Alice wins
}}

* At step 6 of the game (when all of the heaps are empty) the position is &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;, because Bob has no valid moves to make.  We name this position &lt;math&gt;*0&lt;/math&gt;. 
* At step 5, Alice had exactly one option: to remove one object from heap C, leaving Bob with no moves.  Since her ''move'' leaves Bob in position &lt;math&gt;*0&lt;/math&gt;, her ''position'' is written &lt;math&gt;\{ *0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.  We name this position &lt;math&gt;*1&lt;/math&gt;.
* At step 4, Bob had two options: remove one from B or remove one from C.  Note, however, that it didn't really matter which heap Bob removed the object from: Either way, Alice would be left with exactly one object in exactly one pile. So, using our recursive definition, Bob really only has one move: &lt;math&gt;*1&lt;/math&gt;.   Thus, Bob's position is &lt;math&gt;\{*1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* At step 3, Alice had 3 options: remove two from C, remove one from C, or remove one from B.  Removing two from C leaves Bob in position &lt;math&gt;*1&lt;/math&gt;.  Removing one from C leaves Bob with two piles, each of size one, i.e., position &lt;math&gt;\{*1\}&lt;/math&gt;, as described in step 4. However, removing 1 from B would leave Bob with two objects in a single pile. ''His'' moves would then be &lt;math&gt;*0&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;*1&lt;/math&gt;, so ''her'' move would result in the position &lt;math&gt;\{*0, *1\}&lt;/math&gt;.  We call this position &lt;math&gt;*2&lt;/math&gt;.  Alice's position is then the set of all her moves: &lt;math&gt;\big\{*1, \{*1\}, *2\big\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Following the same recursive logic, at step 2, Bob's position is &lt;math&gt;\big\{ \{*1, \{*1\}, *2\}, *2\big\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Finally, at step 1, Alice's position is 
&lt;math&gt;\Big\{
    \big\{*1, \{*1\}, *2\big\},
    \big\{*2, \{*1, \{*1\},*2\} \big\},
    \big\{\{*1\}, \{\{*1\}\}, \{*1, \{*1\}, *2\}\big\}
\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Nimbers===
The special names &lt;math&gt;*0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;*1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;*2&lt;/math&gt; referenced in our example game are called '''''[[nimber]]s'''''.  In general, the nimber &lt;math&gt;*n&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the position in a game of nim where there are exactly &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; objects in exactly one heap.  
Formally, nimbers are defined inductively as follows:  &lt;math&gt;*0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;*1 = \{*0\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;*2 = \{*0, *1\}&lt;/math&gt; and  for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;*(n+1) = *n \cup \{*n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

While the word ''nim''ber comes from the game ''nim'', nimbers can be used to describe the positions of any finite, impartial game, and in fact, the Sprague&amp;ndash;Grundy theorem states that every  instance of a finite, impartial game can be associated with a ''single'' nimber.

===Combining Games===
Two games can be combined by '''''adding''''' their positions together.
For example, consider another game of nim with heaps &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt;.

===={{anchor|secondExample}}Example Game 2====
{{Pre|
Sizes of heaps    Moves
&amp;nbsp;
A' B' C'
1  1  1           Alice takes 1 from A'
0  1  1           Bob takes one from B'
0  0  1           Alice takes one from C'
0  0  0           Bob has no moves, so Alice wins.
}}

We can combine it with our [[#firstExample|first example]] to get a combined game with six heaps: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt;:

===={{anchor|thirdExample}}Combined Game====

 A  B  C  A' B' C'  
 &amp;nbsp;
 1  2  2  1  1  1   Alice takes 1 from A

[[File:Coin of Tetricus I.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of [[Tetricus I]]]]
Year '''274''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCLXXIV]]''') was a [[common year starting on Thursday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Aurelianus and Capitolinus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1027 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 274 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

With the conquests of the [[Palmyrene Empire]] and the Gallic Empire, the [[Roman Empire]] is united again. 
* [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] greets Aurelian as ''Restitutor Orbis'' (&quot;Restorer of the World&quot;) and accords him a magnificent [[Roman triumph|triumph]] (victory procession), which is graced by his captives Tetricus I and his son Tetricus II.

* [[December 25]] &amp;ndash; Aurelian has a temple dedicated to [[Sol Invictus]], on the third day after the [[solstice]] and day of rebirth of the Sun. This religion, which is in essence monotheistic, becomes the [[Religion in ancient Rome|state religion]] of Rome.

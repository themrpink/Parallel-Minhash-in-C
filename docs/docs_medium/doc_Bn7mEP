Prior to the construction of the first bridge in 1966, the channel was crossed by the [[Aust Ferry]].

Other notable bridges include:

* [[Buttington]] Bridge – built in 1872
* [[Montford Bridge]] – [[Thomas Telford|Thomas Telford's]] first ever bridge design, built between 1790 and 1792
* Welsh Bridge – in the centre of Shrewsbury, built in 1795 at a cost of £8,000
* English Bridge – also in Shrewsbury, designed and completed in 1774 by [[John Gwynn (architect)|John Gwynn]]
* [[Atcham]] Bridges – the old one built in 1774, while the newer one in 1929 carries the B4380
* [[Albert Edward Bridge]] – in Coalbrookdale, a railway bridge opened in 1864
* [[Coalport]] Bridge – like its neighbour Ironbridge, is made of cast iron, built in 1818
* [[Victoria Bridge, Worcestershire|Victoria Bridge]]  – designed by [[Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet|John Fowler]], opened in 1862. Still in use by the [[Severn Valley Railway]]
* Bewdley Bridge – designed by Telford, completed in 1798
* [[Holt Fleet]] Bridge – in Worcestershire and designed by Telford and opened in 1828
* Upton Town Bridge – built in 1940, the only bridge to cross between Worcester and Tewkesbury
* Queenshill Viaduct – carries the [[M50 motorway (Great Britain)|M50]] between Junction 1 and 2
* [[Mythe Bridge]] – designed by Telford and opened in April 1826, located in [[Tewkesbury]]
* Haw Bridge – a steel beam bridge, west of Tewkesbury
* [[Maisemore]] Bridge – carries the A417 and is a single masonry arch, dating back to 1230.
* [[Over Bridge]] – single masonry arch, built by Telford
* Over Rail Bridge – carrying the [[Gloucester to Newport Line]], currently the last bridge before the Severn Crossings, which is {{convert|30|mi}} downstream
* [[Severn Rail Bridge]] – linking the [[Forest of Dean]] to [[Sharpness]] docks, partially collapsed in 1960 and was dismantled in 1967–70

===Rail===
The [[Severn Tunnel]], completed in 1886 by [[John Hawkshaw]] on behalf of the [[Great Western Railway]], lies near the [[Second Severn Crossing]] road bridge, and carries the [[South Wales Main Line]] section of the [[Great Western Main Line]] under the channel. The original line built before the [[Severn Tunnel]] was the [[South Wales Railway]] from [[Gloucester railway station|Gloucester]], that followed the estuary alongside present day stations of [[Lydney railway station|Lydney]], [[Chepstow railway station|Chepstow]], [[Caldicot railway station|Caldicot]] and [[Severn Tunnel Junction]] to [[Newport railway station|Newport]].

Cars could also be transported through the Severn Tunnel. In the 1950s three trains a day made round trips between [[Severn Tunnel Junction railway station|Severn Tunnel Junction]] and [[Pilning railway station|Pilning]]. The vehicles were loaded onto open flat bed carriages and pulled by a small [[Pannier tank|pannier tank locomotive]], although sometimes they were joined to a scheduled passenger train. The prudent owner paid to cover the vehicle with a sheet, as sparks often flew when the [[steam locomotive]] tackled the slope leading to the tunnel exit. A railway coach was provided for passengers and drivers. Reservations could be made and the fee for the car was about thirty shillings (£1.50) in the early 1950s.

===Disasters===
[[File:TewkesburyFloods210707.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tewkesbury]] during the [[2007 United Kingdom floods|2007 floods]]]]
There have been many [[disasters on the Severn]], which have claimed perhaps 300 lives, depending on sources, especially during the 20th century. The [[Severn Railway Bridge]] was badly damaged by the collision of two river barges in 1960, which led to its demolition in 1970. Five crew members of both the Arkendale H and Wastdale H died in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Huxley, The Rise and Fall of the Severn Bridge Railway, 1984, {{ISBN|978-1-84868-033-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the river flooded during the [[2007 United Kingdom floods]] and the [[2019–20 United Kingdom floods]].

===Navigation===
[[File:St Twrog's Chapel ruins on Chapel Rock - geograph.org.uk - 545622.jpg|thumbnail|left|Navigation light on Chapel Rock near [[Beachley]]]]
There is a public right of navigation between [[Pool Quay]], near [[Welshpool]], and [[Stourport-on-Severn|Stourport]]. However this stretch of the river has little traffic, other than small boats, canoes and some tour boats in Shrewsbury. Below Stourport, where the river is more navigable for larger craft, users must obtain permits from the [[Canal &amp; River Trust]], who are the [[navigation authority]]. During spring [[freshet]] the river can be closed to navigation.

At Upper Parting above Gloucester, the river divides into two, and flows either side of [[Alney Island]] to Lower Parting. The West Channel is no longer navigable. The East Channel is navigable as far as Gloucester Docks, from where the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]] provides a navigable channel south. Between the docks and Lower Parting [[Llanthony Secunda|Llanthony Weir]] marks the Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the East Channel of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&amp;gazName=p&amp;gazString=GLOUCESTER|title=OS Maps - online and App mapping system - Ordnance Survey Shop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tidal section of the river below Gloucester, the [[Gloucester Harbour Trustees]] are the competent harbour authority. The Trustees maintain navigation lights at various points along the river (including on Chapel Rock and Lyde Rock, and [[leading lights]] at Slime Road, Sheperdine and Berkeley Pill).

===Locks===
There are locks on the lower Severn to enable seagoing boats to reach as far as [[Stourport]]. The most northerly lock is at Lincombe, about {{convert|1|mi}} downstream from Stourport.

===Associated canals===
{{River Severn map}}
The [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]], the [[Worcester and Birmingham Canal]], (both narrow beam) and the [[Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal]] join the Severn at [[Stourport-on-Severn|Stourport]], [[Worcester, England|Worcester]] and [[Gloucester]] respectively. The [[Droitwich Canal|Droitwich Barge Canal]], a broad beam canal, joins the Severn at [[Hawford]], near to the [[River Salwarpe]], and connects to the Droitwich Canal (narrow beam) in the name town, which then forms a link to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. The two Droitwich canals re-opened in 2010 after major restoration.

The [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]] connects the Severn at Gloucester to the Severn at [[Sharpness]], avoiding a stretch of the tidal river which is dangerous to navigate. The [[Stroudwater Navigation]] used to join the tidal Severn at [[Framilode]], but since the 1920s has connected to the Severn only via the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal.

The [[Lydney Canal]] is a short canal which connects [[Lydney]] to the river.

The section of the river between Tewkesbury and Worcester forms part of the [[Avon Ring]], a {{convert|109|mi|km|adj=on}} circular cruising route which includes 129 locks and covers parts of three other waterways.

===Passenger transport===

====The tidal river====
[[Paddle steamer]]s were operated in the Severn Estuary from the mid 19th century to the late 1970s by [[P &amp; A Campbell]] of [[Bristol]]. The vessels, ''Cardiff Queen'', ''Bristol Queen'', ''Glen Usk'', ''Glen Gower'' and ''Britannia'' all operated on this route in the 1950s and 1960s.  Since 1986 Waverley Excursions has operated occasional sailings to Sharpness and Lydney by the ''[[MV Balmoral (1949)|MV Balmoral]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waverleyexcursions.co.uk/bristol.htm Waverley Excursions website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804142737/http://www.waverleyexcursions.co.uk/bristol.htm |date=4 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of ferries were also operated on the tidal river, for example at [[New Passage]], [[Purton, Berkeley|Purton]] and [[Arlingham]]. The last ferry was the [[Aust Ferry]], which closed in 1966 when the Severn Bridge opened. One of the Aust ferries, ''Severn Princess'', is still in [[Chepstow]] although largely derelict.

====The upper river====

In Worcester, the [[Worcester River Cruises]] have boat trips up and down the river between [[Tewkesbury]] and [[Stourport]], operating the boats ''The Pride of the Midlands'' and ''The Earl Grosvenor''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worcesterrivercruises.co.uk/home.html Worcester River Cruises website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708025438/http://www.worcesterrivercruises.co.uk/home.html |date=8 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cathedral Ferry, a foot passenger ferry, also operates on summer weekends from the steps of [[Worcester Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pryce |first1=Mike |title=NOSTALGIA: Worcester's Cathedral Ferry is a Severn tradition |url=https://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/17723708.nostalgia-worcesters-cathedral-ferry-is-a-severn-tradition-says-mike-pryce/ |accessdate=27 October 2019 |work=Worcester News |date=22 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shropshire the [[Hampton Loade Ferry]] used to operate across the river though has been closed since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampton Loade Station|url=http://www.svr.co.uk/Hampton-Info.aspx|website=Severn Valley Railway|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shrewsbury, boat trips around the loop of the town centre are at present provided by the ''Sabrina'' and depart from Victoria Quay near the [[Welsh Bridge]] during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrewsburyboat.co.uk/|title=shrewsburyboat.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Severn Estuary==
{{Main|Severn Estuary}}
[[File:Severn Aerial.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Severn crossing|Severn bridges]] crossing near the mouth of the '''River Severn''']]
The river becomes tidal close to [[Maisemore]], on the West Channel just north of Gloucester, and at Llanthony Weir on the East Channel. The tidal river downstream from Gloucester is sometimes referred to as the Severn Estuary, but the river is usually considered to become the Severn Estuary after the [[Second Severn Crossing]] near [[Severn Beach]], [[South Gloucestershire]] (the point to which the jurisdiction of the [[Gloucester Harbour Trustees]] extends), or at [[Aust]], the site of the [[Severn Bridge]].

The Severn Estuary extends to a line from [[Lavernock Point]] (south of [[Cardiff]]) to [[Sand Point, Somerset|Sand Point]] near [[Weston-super-Mare]]. West of this line is the [[Bristol Channel]]. In the Severn Estuary (or the [[Bristol Channel]] in the last two cases, depending where the boundary is drawn) are the rocky islands called [[Denny Island]], [[Steep Holm]] and [[Flat Holm]].

The estuary is about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} wide at Aust, and about {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} wide between Cardiff and Weston-super-Mare.

==Severn Sea==
{{Main|Bristol Channel}}
Until [[Tudor period|Tudor times]] the Bristol Channel was known as the '''Severn Sea''', and it is still known as this in both [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] (Môr Hafren and Mor Havren respectively, with '''Môr''' meaning '''Sea''').

==Severn bore==
{{Main|Severn bore}}
[[Image:SevernBore1994.jpg|thumb|left|Bore hitting the riverbank in 1994]]
A phenomenon associated with the lower reaches of the Severn is the [[tidal bore]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowbotham, Severn Bore&quot; &gt;{{cite book
  |last=Rowbotham  |first=Fred

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which forms upstream of the port of [[Sharpness]].

It is frequently asserted that the river's [[estuary]], which empties into the [[Bristol Channel]], has the second largest [[tidal range]] in the world—{{convert|48|ft|m|0}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However a tidal range greater than that of the Severn is recorded from the lesser known [[Ungava Bay]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/faq2.html#26 |title=Frequently Asked Questions – Tide Predictions and Data |publisher=Co-ops.nos.noaa.gov |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the highest tides, the rising water is funnelled up the Severn estuary into a wave that travels rapidly upstream against the river current. The largest bores occur in spring, but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. The bore is accompanied by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed.

==Industry==
A {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the River Severn in [[Shropshire]], is known as [[Ironbridge Gorge]]. It was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1986. Its historic importance is due to its role as the centre of the [[Ironworks|iron industry]] in the early stages of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The gorge and the village of [[Ironbridge]] get their name from the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] across the Severn, built in 1779, which was the first cast-iron arch bridge ever constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/371|title=Ironbridge Gorge|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two nuclear power stations are situated on the river, in the area of South Gloucestershire. [[Oldbury Nuclear Power Station]] and [[Berkeley Nuclear Power Station]] both made use of the River Severn as part of the power generation and nuclear cooling processes.  Both are now decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-25198759 |title=Berkeley named as preferred nuclear waste site |publisher=BBC |date=3 December 2013 |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
The sides of the estuary are also important feeding grounds for [[wader]]s, notably at the [[Bridgwater Bay]] [[national nature reserves in England|National Nature Reserve]] and the [[WWT Slimbridge|Slimbridge Wildfowl Trust]]. River shingle habitat can also be found on the lower estuary, notable for its population of the endangered [[Coccinellidae#UK ladybird survey|5-spot Ladybird]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/endangered-ladybird-found-only-wales-1827527 |title= Wales Online |accessdate= 26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The river forms part of the [[Severn-Trent flyway]], a route used by [[bird migration|migratory birds]] to cross [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WtgW&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=RSPB Where To Go Wild in Britain |date=2009 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=978-1405335126 |page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary and musical allusions ==
The River Severn is named several times in [[A.E. Housman]]'s ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]'' (1896): &quot;It dawns in Asia, tombstones show/And Shropshire names are read;/And the Nile spills his overflow/Beside the Severn's dead&quot; (“1887&quot;); &quot;Severn stream&quot; (“The Welsh Marches&quot;); and &quot;Severn shore&quot; (“Westward from the high-hilled plain...”).

In [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', [[Henry Hotspur Percy]] recalls the valour of [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]] in a long battle against Welshman [[Owain Glyndŵr]] upon the Severn's banks, claiming the flooding Severn &quot;affrighted with (the warriors') bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank, bloodstained with these valiant combatants.&quot;

The Severn was the inspiration for a number of works by Gloucestershire composer [[Ivor Gurney]], including the songs &quot;Western Sailors&quot; (1925) and &quot;Severn Meadows&quot; (1917).

Gloucestershire writer and poet Brian Waters published ''Severn Tide'' with [[J. M. Dent]] in 1947 and followed it with ''Severn Stream'' in 1949. With anecdotal stories about his travels, both books tell of  the lives of the people who lived and worked on and along the river, describing the landscape with a poet's eye. Waters links [[Nodens]] with the Seven Bore and the association of the Celtic deity with the river is explored at length by Rogers.&lt;ref name=rogers/&gt;

Several 20th-century English composers wrote works inspired by the river. [[Gerald Finzi]] (1901-1956) wrote ''A Severn Rhapsody,'' his Opus 3, in 1923; taking the Severn River and its surrounding countryside as his inspiration. [[Edward Elgar]] (1857-1934) wrote ''[[The Severn Suite]],'' Opus 87, in 1930. Elgar lived much of both his early life and his later life near [[Worcester, England|Worcester]], through which the Severn runs. [[Herbert Howells]] (1892-1983), born close to the Severn in [[Lydney]], wrote the complex ''Missa Sabrinensis'' (Mass of the Severn) in 1954, and an earlier hymn tune simply entitled ''Severn''.

The Severn is often mentioned in [[Ellis Peters]]' ''[[The Cadfael Chronicles]]'', set in or around [[Shrewsbury Abbey]], beside the river.

In [[Julian Barnes]]' 2011 novel, ''[[The Sense of an Ending]]'', Tony, the main character, recalls &quot;a river rushing nonsensically upstream, its wave and wash lit by half a dozen chasing torchbeams,&quot; an allusion to a visit to the Severn Bore.

The '''Andaman Sea''' (historically also known as the '''Burma Sea''')&lt;ref name=&quot;IHO&quot; /&gt; is a [[marginal sea]] of northeastern Indian Ocean bounded by the coastlines of Myanmar and Thailand along the [[Gulf of Martaban]] and west side of the [[Malay Peninsula]], and separated from the [[Bay of Bengal]] to its west by the [[Andaman Islands]] and the [[Nicobar Islands]].  Its southernmost end is defined by [[Breueh Island]], an island just north of [[Sumatra]], and communicates with the [[Malacca Strait]].

Traditionally, the sea has been used for fishery and transportation of goods between the coastal countries and its [[coral reef]]s and islands are popular tourist destinations.  The fishery and tourist infrastructure was severely damaged by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]].

==Geography==

===Location===

The Andaman Sea, which extends over 92°E to 100°E and 4°N to 20°N, occupies a very significant position in the Indian Ocean, yet remained unexplored for long period of time. To the south of Myanmar, west of Thailand, and north of Indonesia, this sea is separated from [[Bay of Bengal]] by the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands]] and an associated chain of sea mounts along the [[Indian Plate|Indo]]-[[Burma Plate|Burmese]] plate boundary. The [[Strait of Malacca]] (between Malay Peninsula and [[Sumatra]]) forms the southern exit way of the basin, which is 3&amp;nbsp;km wide and 37 m deep.

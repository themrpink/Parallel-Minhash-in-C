===Mu-metal cable===
[[File:Mu metal submarine telegraph cable construction.svg|thumb|left|300px|Mu-metal cable construction]]
[[Mu-metal]] has similar magnetic properties to permalloy but the addition of copper to the alloy increases the ductility and allows the metal to be drawn into wire.  Mu-metal cable is easier to construct than permalloy cable, the mu-metal being wound around the core copper conductor in much the same way as the iron wire in Krarup cable.  A further advantage with mu-metal cable is that the construction lends itself to a variable loading profile whereby the loading is tapered towards the ends.

Mu-metal was invented in 1923 by the [[Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company]], London,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, WS, Garnett, HJ, ''New and improved magnetic alloys, and their application in the manufacture of telegraphic and telephonic cables'', Patent GB224972, filed 25 Aug 1923, issued 25 Nov 1925.  patented in the US as US1582353 and US1552769&lt;/ref&gt; who made the cable, initially, for the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Co]].  Western Union were in competition with AT&amp;T and the [[Western Electric Company]] who were using permalloy.  The patent for permalloy was held by Western Electric which prevented Western Union from using it.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Green, &quot;150 Years Of Industry &amp; Enterprise At [[Enderby's Wharf]]&quot; paper presented at University College, July 2004, for ''History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Undersea Communications'' [http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/EnderbyAG/index.htm retrieved] 16 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patch loading===
Continuous loading of cables is expensive and hence is only done when absolutely necessary.  Lumped loading with coils is cheaper but has the disadvantages of difficult seals and a definite cutoff frequency.  A compromise scheme is '''patch loading''' whereby the cable is continuously loaded in repeated sections.  The intervening sections are left unloaded.&lt;ref&gt;Bakshi &amp; Bakshi, p1.55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current practice===
Loaded cable is no longer a useful technology for submarine communication cables, having first been superseded by [[coaxial cable|co-axial cable]] using electrically powered in-line [[repeater]]s and then by [[optical fiber|fibre-optic cable]].  Manufacture of loaded cable declined in the 1930s and was then superseded by other technologies post-war.  Loading coils can still be found in some telephone landlines today but new installations use more modern technology.

[[Image:LATAs.png|thumb|right|350px|Map of LATAs in the US]] 
'''Local access and transport area''' ('''LATA''') is a term used in U.S. telecommunications regulation.  It represents a geographical area of the United States under the terms of the [[Modification of Final Judgment]] (MFJ) entered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Civil Action number 82-0192 or any other geographic area designated as a LATA in the [[National Exchange Carrier Association]], Inc. Tariff FCC No. 4. that precipitated the breakup of the original [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] into the &quot;[[Regional Bell Operating Company|Baby Bells]]&quot; or created since that time for [[Plain old telephone service|wireline]] regulation.

Generally, a LATA represents an area within which a [[divested]] [[Regional Bell Operating Company]] (RBOC) is permitted to offer [[telephone exchange|exchange]] telecommunications and exchange access services. Under the terms of the MFJ, the RBOCs are generally prohibited from providing services that originate in one LATA and terminate in another.

LATA boundaries tend to be drawn around markets, and not necessarily along existing [[U.S. state|state]] or [[Telephone numbering plan#Area code|area code]] borders. Some LATAs cross over state boundaries, such as those for the [[New York metropolitan area]] and [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]; [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; and areas between [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], and [[West Virginia]]. Area codes and LATAs do not necessarily share boundaries; many LATAs exist in multiple area codes, and many area codes exist in multiple LATAs.

Originally, the LATAs were grouped into regions within which one particular RBOC was allowed to provide services. The LATAs in each of these regions are numbered beginning with the same digit. Generally, the LATAs were associated with [[telephone carrier|carrier]]s or other indications in the following manner:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Digit||Area/Use||[[RBOC]]
|-
|0xx||unused||
|-
|1xx||[[New York (state)|New York]] &amp; [[New England]]||[[NYNEX]] (now [[Verizon]] and [[Consolidated Communications]])
|-
|2xx||[[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]]||[[Bell Atlantic]] (now Verizon and [[Frontier West Virginia|Frontier]])
|-
|3xx||[[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes]]||[[Ameritech]] (now [[AT&amp;T Inc.]])
|-
|4xx||[[American Southeast|Southeast]]||[[BellSouth]] (now AT&amp;T Inc.)
|-
|5xx||[[American South Central States|South-central]]||[[Southwestern Bell]] (now AT&amp;T Inc.)
|-
|6xx||[[Pacific Northwest]], [[Midwest]], and [[Rocky Mountains]]||[[US West]] (now [[CenturyLink]])
|-
|7xx||[[California]] and [[Nevada]]||[[Pacific Bell]] (now AT&amp;T Inc.)
|-
|8xx||Non-contiguous and international areas||
|-
|9xx||Other/Expansion||
|}

In addition to this list, two local carriers were made independent: [[Cincinnati Bell]] in the [[Cincinnati]] area, and [[Southern New England Telephone|SNET]] (a former unit of AT&amp;T, sold to [[Frontier Communications|Frontier]]) in [[Connecticut]]. These were assigned LATAs in the 9xx range.

Since the [[Modification of Final Judgment|breakup of the original AT&amp;T]] in 1984, however, some amount of [[deregulation]], as well as a number of phone company [[merger]]s, have blurred the significance of these regions. A number of new LATAs have been formed within these regions since their inception, most beginning with the digit 9.

LATAs contribute to an often confusing aspect of [[long–distance calling|long–distance]] telephone service. Due to the various and overlapping regulatory limitations and inter-business arrangements, phone companies typically provide differing types of “long distance” service, each with potentially different rates:
* within same LATA, within same state
* within same LATA, between different states
* between different LATAs, within same state
* between different LATAs, between different states
Given the complexity of the legal and financial issues involved in each distinction, many long-distance companies tend to not explain the details of these different rates, which can lead to billing questions from surprised customers.

Local carriers have various alternative terms for LATAs such as “Service Area” by Pacific Bell in California, or “Regional Calling Area” by Verizon in Maryland.

In order to facilitate the sharing of [[Telcordia]] telephone routing databases between countries, LATAs were later defined for the provinces of [[Canada]], the other countries and territories of the [[North American Numbering Plan]], and [[Mexico]]. Aside from U.S. territories, LATAs have no regulatory purpose in these areas. In 2000, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] eliminated all Canadian provincial LATAs in favor of a single LATA for Canada (888).

No LATAs exist with a second digit of 0 or 1, which distinguished them from traditional [[Numbering plan area|area codes]].

==List of LATAs==

===US state LATAs===
The city or place name given with some LATAs is the name given to identify the LATA, not the limit of its boundary. Generally this is the most significant metropolitan area in the LATA. In some cases, a LATA is named after the largest phone exchange in the LATA that was historically served by an RBOC. For example, the largest city in the Pahrump LATA in Nevada is [[Las Vegas]]. Since Las Vegas was not historically served by an RBOC, the LATA is named after the smaller town of Pahrump, which was historically served by Nevada Bell (now AT&amp;T Inc.). Also, listing under a state does not necessarily limit the LATA's territory to that state; there may be overlaps as well as [[enclave]]s. Areas that include notable portions of other states are explained, but not all LATA state overlaps may be detailed.

LATA boundaries are not always solidly defined. Inter-carrier agreements, change proposals to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), and new wiring developments into rural areas can and do often alter the effective borders between LATAs. Many sources on LATA boundary information conflict with each other at detailed levels. [[Telcordia]] data may provide the most up-to-date details of LATA inclusions.

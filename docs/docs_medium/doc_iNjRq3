At the age of 12, his father sent him to work in a bookshop and [[lending library]], a popular institution in Japanese cities, where reading books made from woodcut blocks was a popular entertainment of the middle and upper classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston&quot;/&gt; At 14, he worked as an apprentice to a woodcarver, until the age of 18, when he entered the studio of [[Katsukawa Shunshō]]. Shunshō was an artist of [[ukiyo-e]], a style of woodblock prints and paintings that Hokusai would master, and head of the so-called Katsukawa school.&lt;ref name=&quot;nagata&quot;/&gt; Ukiyo-e, as practised by artists like Shunshō, focused on images of the courtesans (''[[bijin-ga]]'') and [[kabuki]] actors (''[[yakusha-e]]'') who were popular in Japan's cities at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston117&quot;/&gt;

After a year, Hokusai's name changed for the first time, when he was dubbed Shunrō by his master. It was under this name that he published his first prints, a series of pictures of kabuki actors published in 1779. During the decade he worked in Shunshō's studio, Hokusai was married to his first wife, about whom very little is known except that she died in the early 1790s. He married again in 1797, although this second wife also died after a short time. He fathered two sons and three daughters with these two wives, and his youngest daughter Ei, also known as [[Katsushika Ōi|Ōi]], eventually became an artist and his assistant.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston117&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/author/DA10315358?l=en|title=葛飾, 応為 カツシカ, オウイ|language=Japanese|publisher=[[CiNii]]|access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fireworks in the Cool of Evening at Ryogoku Bridge in Edo'' ({{circa|1788–89}}) dates from this period of Hokusai's life.&lt;ref&gt;Calza (2003), p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of Shunshō in 1793, Hokusai began exploring other styles of art, including European styles he was exposed to through French and Dutch copper engravings he was able to acquire.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston117&quot;/&gt; He was soon expelled from the Katsukawa school by Shunkō, the chief disciple of Shunshō, possibly due to his studies at the rival [[Kanō school]]. This event was, in his own words, inspirational: &quot;What really motivated the development of my artistic style was the embarrassment I suffered at Shunkō's hands.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lane&quot;/&gt;

Hokusai also changed the subjects of his works, moving away from the images of courtesans and actors that were the traditional subjects of ukiyo-e. Instead, his work became focused on landscapes and images of the daily life of Japanese people from a variety of social levels. This change of subject was a breakthrough in ukiyo-e and in Hokusai's career.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston117&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Katsushika Hokusai - Fine Wind, Clear Morning (Gaifū kaisei) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning]]'' {or ''Red Fuji''), &lt;br /&gt; from ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'']]
The next period saw Hokusai's association with the Tawaraya School and the adoption of the name &quot;Tawaraya Sōri&quot;. He produced many privately commissioned prints for special occasions (''[[surimono]]''), and illustrations for books of humorous poems (''kyōka ehon'') during this time. In 1798, Hokusai passed his name on to a pupil and set out as an independent artist, free from ties to a school for the first time, adopting the name Hokusai Tomisa.

By 1800, Hokusai was further developing his use of ukiyo-e for purposes other than portraiture. He had also adopted the name he would most widely be known by, Katsushika Hokusai, the former name referring to the part of Edo where he was born, the latter meaning 'north studio', in honour of the [[North Star]], symbol of a deity important in his religion of [[Nichiren Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;The name &quot;Hokusai&quot; (北斎 &quot;North Studio&quot;） is an abbreviation of &quot;Hokushinsai&quot; (北辰際 &quot;North Star Studio&quot;). In Nichiren Buddhism the North Star is revered as a deity known as [[Myōken]].&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he published two collections of landscapes, ''Famous Sights of the Eastern Capital'' and ''Eight Views of Edo'' (modern Tokyo). He also began to attract students of his own, eventually teaching 50 pupils over the course of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston117&quot;/&gt;

He became increasingly famous over the next decade, both due to his artwork and his talent for self-promotion. During an Edo festival in 1804, he created an enormous portrait of the Buddhist prelate [[Bodhidharma|Daruma]], said to be 200 square meters, using a broom and buckets full of ink.&lt;ref&gt;Calza (2003), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Another story places him in the court of the [[shōgun]] [[Tokugawa Ienari]], invited there to compete with another artist who practised more traditional brushstroke painting. Hokusai's painted blue curve on paper, then chased a chicken whose feet had been dipped in red paint across the image. He described the painting to the shōgun as a landscape showing the Tatsuta River with red maple leaves floating in it, winning the competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston1&quot;/&gt;

1807 saw Hokusai collaborate with the popular novelist [[Takizawa Bakin]] on a series of illustrated books. Especially popular was the fantasy novel ''Chinsetu Yumiharizuki'' (''Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon'') with [[Minamoto no Tametomo]] as the main character, and Hokusai gained fame with his creative and powerful illustrations, but the collaboration ended after seven works due to differences of opinion with Bakin regarding the illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hokusai-kan.com/exhibition/1683/ 北斎生誕260年記念 北斎資格のマジック] Hokusai kan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://hokusai-kan.com/blog/708/ 曲亭馬琴と葛飾北斎] Hokusai kan&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher, given the choice between keeping Hokusai or Bakin on the project, opted to keep Hokusai, emphasizing the importance of illustrations in printed works of the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston118&quot;/&gt; Hokusai also created several albums of [[erotic art]] (''[[Shunga (art)|shunga]]''). His most famous image in this genre is ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'', which depicts a young woman entwined sexually with a pair of octopuses, from ''[[Kinoe no Komatsu]]'', a three-volume book of shunga from 1814.&lt;ref&gt;Calza (2003), p. 455&lt;/ref&gt;

Hokusai paid close attention to the production of his work. In letters during his involvement with ''Toshisen Ehon'', a Japanese edition of an anthology of Chinese poetry, Hokusai wrote to the publisher that the blockcutter [[Egawa Tomekichi]], with whom Hokusai had previously worked and whom he respected, had strayed from Hokusai's style in the cutting of certain heads. He also wrote directly to another blockcutter involved in the project, Sugita Kinsuke, stating that he disliked the [[Utagawa school]] style in which Kinsuke had cut the figure's eyes and noses and that amendments were needed for the final prints to be true to his style. In his letter, Hokusai included examples of both his style of illustrating eyes and noses and the Utagawa school style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tinios|first1=Ellis|title=Hokusai and his Blockcutters|journal=Print Quarterly|date=June 2015|volume=XXXII|issue=2|pages=186–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, at the age of 51, Hokusai changed his name to ''Taito'' and entered the period in which he created the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'' and various ''etehon'', or art manuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;nagata&quot;/&gt; These manuals beginning in 1812 with ''Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing'', were intended as a convenient way to make money and attract more students. The first volume of ''Manga'' (meaning random drawings) was published in 1814 and was an immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;Hillier, Jack R. (1980). ''The Art of Hokusai in Book Illustration''. London: Sotheby Parke Bernet; Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press. p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; By 1820, he had produced twelve volumes (with three more published posthumously) which include thousands of drawings of objects, plants, animals, religious figures, and everyday people, often with humorous overtones.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston118&quot;/&gt;

On 5 October 1817, he painted the ''[[Great Daruma]]'' outside the [[Hongan-ji Nagoya Betsuin]] in Nagoya. This portrait in ink on paper measured 18 × 10.8 metres, and the event drew huge crowds.  The feat was recounted in a popular song and he received the name &quot;''Darusen''{{-&quot;}} or &quot;Daruma Master&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A shortened form of ''Daruma [[Sensei]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calza (2003), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original was destroyed in 1945, Hokusai's promotional handbills from that time survived and are preserved at the [[Nagoya City Museum]].

In 1820, Hokusai changed his name yet again, this time to &quot;Iitsu,&quot; a change which marked the start of a period in which he secured fame as an artist throughout Japan. His most celebrated work, ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'', including the famous ''[[Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' and ''[[Red Fuji]]'' was produced in the early 1830s. The results of Hokusai's perspectival studies in ''Manga'' can be seen here in ''The Great Wave'' where he uses what would have been seen as a western perspective to represent depth and volume.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Screech|first=Timon|year=2012|title=Hokusai's Lines of Sight|jstor=41601844|journal=Mechademia|volume=7|page=107&lt;!--|pages=103-109--&gt;|doi=10.1353/mec.2012.0009|s2cid=119865798}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proved so popular that ten more prints were later added to the series. Among the other popular series of prints he made during this time are ''[[A Tour of the Waterfalls of the Provinces]]'', ''[[Oceans of Wisdom]]'' and ''Unusual Views of Celebrated Bridges in the Provinces''.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston2&quot;/&gt; He also began producing a number of detailed individual images of flowers and birds (''[[kachō-e]]''), including the extraordinarily detailed ''Poppies'' and ''Flock of Chickens''.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston119&quot;/&gt;

==Later life==
The next period, beginning in 1834, saw Hokusai working under the name &quot;Gakyō Rōjin&quot; ({{lang|ja|画狂老人}}; &quot;The Old Man Mad About Art&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;gvjh.org&quot;/&gt; It was at this time that he produced ''[[One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji]]'', another significant series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mfa.org/collections/object/fugaku-hyakkei-one-hundred-views-of-mount-fuji-334906 |title=Fugaku hyakkei (One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji) |date=2018-12-21 |website=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston |language=en |access-date=2019-01-22 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally considered &quot;the masterpiece among his landscape picture books&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lane&quot;/&gt;

In the [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] to this work, Hokusai writes:

{{quote|From the age of six, I had a passion for copying the form of things and since the age of fifty I have published many drawings, yet of all I drew by my seventieth year there is nothing worth taking into account. At seventy-three years I partly understood the structure of animals, birds, insects and fishes, and the life of grasses and plants. And so, at eighty-six I shall progress further; at ninety I shall even further penetrate their secret meaning, and by one hundred I shall perhaps truly have reached the level of the marvellous and divine. When I am one hundred and ten, each dot, each line will possess a life of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Calza, Gian Carlo. &quot;Hokusau: A Universe&quot; in ''Hokusai'', p. 7.  Phaidon&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1839, a fire destroyed Hokusai's studio and much of his work. By this time, his career was beginning to fade as younger artists such as [[Andō Hiroshige]] became increasingly popular. At the age of 83, Hokusai traveled to [[Obuse, Nagano|Obuse]] in [[Shinano Province]] (now [[Nagano Prefecture]]) at the invitation of a wealthy farmer, Takai Kozan where he stayed for several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hokusai Museum&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the World of Hokusai, an &quot;Old Man Mad About Painting&quot;! |url=https://hokusai-kan.com/en/ |website=Hokusai Kan |publisher=Hokusai Museum |accessdate=16 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Obuse, he created several masterpieces, included the ''Masculine Wave'' and the ''Feminine Wave''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hokusai Museum&quot;/&gt; Between 1842 and 1843, in what he described as &quot;daily exorcisms&quot; (''nisshin joma''), Hokusai painted Chinese lions (''[[Chinese guardian lions|shishi]]'') every morning in ink on paper as a [[talisman]] against misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Visual Genesis of Japanese National Identity: Hokusai's Hyakunin Isshu|first=Ewa|last=Machotka|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2009|isbn=9789052014821|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VZDzGQlPd8C&amp;pg=PA214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/16023/lot/252/|title=Fine Japanese Art, lot 252|publisher=Bonhams|year=2008|accessdate=5 November 2020&lt;/ref&gt;

Hokusai continued working almost until the end, painting ''The Dragon of Smoke Escaping from Mt Fuji''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.katsushikahokusai.com/The-Dragon-of-Smoke-Escaping-from-Mount-Fuji.jsp|website=KatsushikaHokusai.com|title= The Dragon of Smoke Escaping From Mount Fuji, 1849 by Hokusai |accessdate=2 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Tiger in the Snow]]'' in early 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Tsuji Nobou in Calza (2003), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantly seeking to produce better work, he apparently exclaimed on his deathbed, &quot;If only Heaven will give me just another ten years&amp;nbsp;... Just another five more years, then I could become a real painter.&quot; He died on 10 May 1849&lt;ref&gt;(18th day of the 4th month of the 2nd year of the [[Kaei|Kaei era]] by the old calendar)&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried at the [[Seikyō-ji]] in Tokyo (Taito Ward).&lt;ref name=&quot;nagata&quot;/&gt; A [[haiku]] he composed shortly before his death reads: &quot;Though as a ghost, I shall lightly tread, the summer fields.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tsuji Nobou in Calza (2003), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on art and culture==
[[File:Debussy - La Mer - The great wave of Kanaga from Hokusai.jpg|thumb|Cover of [[Debussy]]'s ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', 1905]]

Hokusai had achievements in various fields as an artist. He made designs for book illustrations and woodblock prints, sketches, and painting for over 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hTxubg_aHb8C&amp;q=hokusai+katsushika+family&amp;pg=PA17|title=Art of Japan: Wood-block Color Prints|last=Finley|first=Carol|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Lerner Publications|isbn=9780822520771|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hokusai was an early experimenter with western linear perspective among Japanese artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Paintings as architectural space:&quot;Guided Tours&quot; by Cezanne and Hokusai|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hokusai himself was influenced by [[Sesshū Tōyō]] and other styles of [[Chinese painting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;csuchico&quot;/&gt; His influences stretched across the globe to his western contemporaries in nineteenth-century Europe with [[Japonism]], which started with a craze for collecting Japanese art, particularly ukiyo-e, of which some of the first samples were to be seen in Paris, when in about 1856, the French artist [[Félix Bracquemond]] first came across a copy of the sketchbook ''Hokusai Manga'' at the workshop of his printer.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

He influenced the [[Impressionist|Impressionism]] movement, with themes echoing his work appearing in the work of [[Claude Monet]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], as well as [[Art Nouveau]], or [[Jugendstil]] in Germany.  Many European artists collected his woodcuts such as [[Degas]], [[Gauguin]], [[Klimt]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Manet]], and [[van Gogh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hokusai Retrospective&quot;/&gt; Degas said of him, &quot;Hokusai is not just one artist among others in the Floating World. He is an island, a continent, a whole world in himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2017/may/10/how-after-death-hokusai-changed-art-history/|title=How, after death, Hokusai changed art history|publisher=Phaidon|date=10 May 2017|accessdate=6 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Obrist]]'s whiplash motif, or ''Peitschenhieb'', which came to exemplify the new movement, is visibly influenced by Hokusai's work.

Even after his death, exhibitions of his artworks continue to grow. In 2005, Tokyo National Museum held a Hokusai exhibition which had the largest number of visitors of any exhibit there that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Kendall H.|date=2007-08-13|title=Hokusai and His Age: Ukiyo-e Painting, Printmaking and Book Illustration in Late Edo Japan (review)|journal=The Journal of Japanese Studies|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=521–525|doi=10.1353/jjs.2007.0048|s2cid=143267375|issn=1549-4721}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several paintings from the Tokyo exhibition were also exhibited in the United Kingdom. The British Museum held the first exhibition of Hokusai's later year artworks including ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The Great Wave''' in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hokusai: beyond the Great Wave|last=Carelli|first=Francesco|journal = London Journal of Primary Care|volume = 10|issue = 4|pages = 128–129|date=2018|pmc = 6074688|pmid = 30083250|doi = 10.1080/17571472.2018.1486504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hokusai inspired the [[Hugo Award]]–winning short story by science fiction author [[Roger Zelazny]], &quot;[[24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai]]&quot;, in which the protagonist tours the area surrounding Mount Fuji, stopping at locations painted by Hokusai. A 2011 book on [[mindfulness]] closes with the poem &quot;Hokusai Says&quot; by Roger Keyes, preceded with the explanation that &quot;[s]ometimes poetry captures the soul of an idea better than anything else.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Mark G. Williams|Mark Williams]] and Danny Penman (2011). ''Mindfulness: An Eight-Week Plan for Finding Peace in a Frantic World'', pp. 249, 250–251. The poem is also at [https://gratefulness.org/resource/hokusai-says/ Hokusai Says – Gratefulness.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1985 ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', Richard Lane characterizes Hokusai as &quot;since the later 19th century [having] impressed Western artists, critics and art lovers alike, more, possibly, than any other single Asian artist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Douglas Lane|Lane, Richard]] (1985). &quot;Hokusai&quot;, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 5, p. 973.&lt;/ref&gt;

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Store Selling Picture Books and Ukiyo-e''' by Hokusai shows how [[ukiyo-e]] during the time was actually sold; it shows how these prints were sold at local shops, and ordinary people could buy ukiyo-e. Unusually in this image, Hokusai used a hand-colored approach instead of using several separated woodblocks.[https://books.google.co.jp/books?hl=ja&amp;lr=lang_ja%7Clang_en&amp;id=hTxubg_aHb8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=hokusai+katsushika+family&amp;ots=BxoTa1oSF2&amp;sig=1WHmnbf34lQI0kHsmwbAnsW_i7w#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]

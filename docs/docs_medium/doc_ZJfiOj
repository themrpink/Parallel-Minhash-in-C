int main(void)
{
    // create a Lua state
    lua_State *L = luaL_newstate();

    // load and execute a string
    if (luaL_dostring(L, &quot;function foo (x,y) return x+y end&quot;)) {
        lua_close(L);
        return -1;
    }

    // push value of global &quot;foo&quot; (the function defined above)
    // to the stack, followed by integers 5 and 3
    lua_getglobal(L, &quot;foo&quot;);
    lua_pushinteger(L, 5);
    lua_pushinteger(L, 3);
    lua_call(L, 2, 1); // call a function with two arguments and one return value
    printf(&quot;Result: %d\n&quot;, lua_tointeger(L, -1)); // print integer value of item at stack top
    lua_pop(L, 1); // return stack to original state
    lua_close(L); // close Lua state
    return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Running this example gives:
&lt;pre&gt;$ cc -o example example.c -llua
$ ./example
Result: 8
&lt;/pre&gt;

The C API also provides some special tables, located at various &quot;pseudo-indices&quot; in the Lua stack. At &lt;code&gt;LUA_GLOBALSINDEX&lt;/code&gt; prior to Lua 5.2&lt;ref name=&quot;Changes in the API, Lua 5.2 manual&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#8.3| title = Changes in the API | work = Lua 5.2 Reference Manual| publisher = Lua.org| accessdate = 2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the globals table, &lt;code&gt;_G&lt;/code&gt; from within Lua, which is the main [[namespace]]. There is also a registry located at &lt;code&gt;LUA_REGISTRYINDEX&lt;/code&gt; where C programs can store Lua values for later retrieval.

It is possible to write extension modules using the Lua API. Extension modules are [[Library (computing)#Dynamic linking|shared objects]] which can be used to extend the functionality of the interpreter by providing native facilities to Lua scripts. From the Lua side, such a module appears as a namespace table holding its functions and variables. Lua scripts may load extension modules using &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref name=luarefman /&gt; just like modules written in Lua itself. A growing collection of modules known as ''rocks'' are available through a [[package management system]] called [[LuaRocks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://luarocks.org/| title = LuaRocks| publisher = LuaRocks wiki| accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the spirit of [[CPAN]], [[RubyGems]] and [[Python eggs]]. Prewritten Lua [[Language binding|bindings]] exist for most popular programming languages, including other scripting languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://lua-users.org/wiki/BindingCodeToLua| title = Binding Code To Lua| publisher = Lua-users wiki| accessdate = 2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For C++, there are a number of template-based approaches and some automatic binding generators.

== Applications ==
{{main|List of applications using Lua}}

In [[video game development]], Lua is widely used as a [[scripting language]] by [[Video game programmer#Scripter|programmers]], mainly due to its perceived easiness to embed, fast execution, and short [[learning curve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38338/why-is-lua-considered-a-game-language |title=Why is Lua considered a game language? |accessdate=2017-04-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820131611/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38338/why-is-lua-considered-a-game-language |archivedate=20 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used for manipulating the objects and elements players see in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-10-16|title=5 Game Development Languages You Must Learn Right Now|url=https://narrasoft.com/5-game-development-languages-you-must-learn-right-now/|access-date=2020-11-21|website=NarraSoft|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a poll conducted by GameDev.net showed Lua was the most popular scripting language for game programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gamedev.net/gdpolls/viewpoll.asp?ID=163 |title=Poll Results |accessdate=2017-04-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031207171619/http://gamedev.net/gdpolls/viewpoll.asp?ID=163 |archivedate=7 December 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January 2012, Lua was announced as a winner of the Front Line Award 2011 from the magazine ''[[Game Developer (magazine)|Game Developer]]'' in the category Programming Tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdmag.com/blog/2012/01/front-line-award-winners.php |title=Front Line Award Winners Announced |accessdate=2017-04-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615013638/http://www.gdmag.com/blog/2012/01/front-line-award-winners.php |archivedate=15 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of non-game applications also use Lua for extensibility, such as [[LuaTeX]], an implementation of the [[TeX]] type-setting language, [[Redis]], a [[key-value database]], [[Neovim]], a text editor, and [[Nginx]], a [[web server]].

Through the Scribunto extension, Lua is available as a server side scripting language in the [[MediaWiki]] software that powers [[Wikipedia]] and other wikis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Extension:Scribunto - MediaWiki |url=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Scribunto |website=MediaWiki.org |accessdate=21 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Wikipedia:Lua |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lua |accessdate = 2018-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=October 2020}} Among its uses are allowing the integration of data from [[Wikidata]] into articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Infobox_Tutorial|title=Wikidata:Infobox Tutorial - Wikidata|website=www.wikidata.org|access-date=2018-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and powering the [[WP:Automated taxobox system|automated taxobox system]].

==Languages that compile to Lua==
* Moonscript is a [[Dynamic programming language|dynamic]], [[Whitespace character|whitespace]]-sensitive [[scripting language]] inspired by [[CoffeeScript]], which [[Compiler|compiles]] into Lua. This means that instead of using &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;) to delimit sections of code it uses [[Line break (computing)|line breaks]] and [[indentation style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Language Guide - MoonScript 0.5.0|url=https://moonscript.org/reference/|access-date=2020-09-25|website=moonscript.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=leaf|title=leafo/moonscript|date=2020-09-23|url=https://github.com/leafo/moonscript|access-date=2020-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://andregarzia.com/2020/06/languages-that-compile-to-lua.html |title=Languages that compile to Lua |website=AndreGarzia.com |date=  |author=Andre Alves Garzia |accessdate= September 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable usage of MoonScript is a video game distribution website [[Itch.io]].

'''Garrett County''' {{IPAc-en|g|ər|ɛ|t}} is the westernmost [[County (United States)|county]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 30,097,&lt;ref name=&quot;QF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=State &amp; County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/24/24023.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 24, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606163819/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/24/24023.html|archive-date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the third-least populous county in Maryland.

Garrett County has long been part of the [[Pittsburgh Media Market|media market]] of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pgclips.com/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130625132020/http://www.pgclips.com/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1055&amp;Itemid=119|url-status=dead|title=PG Clips|archive-date=2013-06-25|access-date=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be a part of [[Western Maryland]].

The [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] is to the north.  The Maryland–Pennsylvania boundary is commonly known as the [[Mason–Dixon line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last   = Cope| first  = Thomas D| title  = Degrees along the west line, the parallel between Maryland and Pennsylvania| publisher = American Philosophical Society| series    = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 93(2):127-133|date=May 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The eastern border with Allegany County was defined by the Bauer Report, submitted to Governor [[Lloyd Lowndes, Jr.]] on November 9, 1898.&lt;ref name=Code2009&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.amlegal.com/library/md/garrettco.shtml| title = Title 1: General Provisions| work = Garrett County, MD Code of Ordinances| publisher = American Legal Publishing Corporation| accessdate = 2009-11-11| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091031190313/http://www.amlegal.com/LIBRARY/MD/GARRETTCO.SHTML| archive-date = 2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Potomac River]] and [[State of West Virginia]] lie to the south and west.

Garrett County lies in the [[Allegheny Mountains]], which here form the western flank of the [[Appalachian Mountain|Appalachian Mountain Range]]. [[Hoye-Crest]], a summit along [[Backbone Mountain]], is the highest point in Maryland.

The [[Eastern Continental Divide]] runs along portions of [[Backbone Mountain]]. The western part of the county, drained by the [[Youghiogheny River]], is the only part of Maryland within the [[Mississippi River]] [[drainage basin]]. All other parts of the county are in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] basin.

The [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Garrett County, Maryland]] has 20 [[National Register of Historic Places]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2008a}}&lt;/ref&gt; properties and districts, including [[Casselman Bridge, National Road]] a [[National Historic Landmark]]. Garrett County is part of [[Maryland's 6th congressional district]]. The extreme south of the county lies within the [[United States National Radio Quiet Zone]].

==History==
[[File:Cumberland md braddock road.jpg|right|450px|thumb|Map of Braddock's Military Road from Cumberland, MD to Braddock, PA 1755]]
In the early 20th century, the railroad and tourism started to decline. Coal mining and timber production continued at a much slower pace. Today, [[tourism]] has made a dramatic rebound in the county with logging and farming making up the greatest part of the economic base. Due to a cool climate and lack of any large city, Garrett County has remained a sparsely populated rural area.

==Geography==
According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|656|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|647|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.6|sqmi}} (1.3%) is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_24.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913171515/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_24.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 13, 2014 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=September 12, 2014 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second-largest county in Maryland by land area.

Garrett County is Maryland's westernmost, bordered to the north by the [[Mason–Dixon line]] with [[Pennsylvania]], to the south and west by [[West Virginia]] (with the [[Potomac River]] forming its southern boundary), and to the east by a land border with [[Allegany County, Maryland]].  The county's northwesternmost point is approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} southeast of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and its southeasternmost point is approximately {{convert|160|mi|km}} northwest of [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

Garrett County is located entirely within the highland zone of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] known variously as the [[Allegheny Mountains]], the [[Allegheny Plateau]], and the [[Appalachian Plateau]].  The county's highest elevations are located along four flat-topped ridges and range to a height of {{convert|3360|ft|m}} at [[Hoye-Crest]] along [[Backbone Mountain]], the highest point in the state of Maryland.  As is typical in the Allegheny region, broad flats generally lie below the ridge crests at elevations of approximately {{convert|500|ft|m}}.  River valleys are generally narrow and deep, with ravines typically 1,000 to {{convert|1800|ft|m}} below surrounding peaks.

The county contains over {{convert|76000|acre|km2}} of parks, lakes, and publicly accessible forestland.  It is drained by two river systems, the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and the [[Youghiogheny River|Youghiogheny]]. The [[Savage River (Maryland)|Savage River]], a tributary of the Potomac, drains about a third of the county.  The [[Casselman River]], a tributary of the Youghiogheny, flows north from the county's central section into Pennsylvania. The Youghiogheny itself drains the westernmost area of the county and flows north into Pennsylvania, where it empties into the [[Monongahela River]] at [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]], just south of [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name=dnr-blank&gt;{{cite journal

===Geologic points of interest===

====The Glades====
The Glades' {{convert|601|acre|km2}} is of great scientific interest because it is an ombrotrophic system (fed solely by rainwater) with peat layers up to {{convert|9|ft|m}} thick, and is one of the oldest examples of mountain peatland in the [[Appalachians]].&lt;ref name=nc-m&gt;{{cite web

On the western edge of the [[Savage River State Forest]] along [[Maryland Route 495]] lies [[Bittinger, Maryland]], which is named after [[Henry Bittinger]], who first settled in the area and who was joined by other German settlers moving in and taking up the fertile farmland. On the eastern edge of Bittinger is one of the largest [[Glade (geography)|glades]] area of Garrett County. Geographically, this is an area that seems to have been affected by the last great ice sheet of North America. Two miles southeast of Bittinger, there is a large deposit of [[peat moss]].

====Loess Dunes====
In the [[Casselman River]] valley, {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} south of [[Grantsville, Maryland]] and beside [[Maryland Route 495]], one can see remains of geological evidence about the last great ice sheet over North America. A series of low mounds can be seen in the fields on the west side of [[Maryland Route 495]] that are &quot;loess&quot; (wind-blown) material. Apparently, these are the only ones still visible in the northern part of Garrett County.

The mounds were formed when a glacier lake existed in the Casselman valley, and the ice around the edges of the frozen lake melted. Wind blew fine grains of earth into the water around the edges where it sank to the bottom, and the mounds were the result of the deposit of this wind-blown material.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Europe ====
* [[February]] &amp;ndash; King [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] invades [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] at the head of an [[East Francia|East Frankish]] expeditionary army. He storms [[Rome]] (the [[Leonine City]]), and has himself crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope Formosus]] at [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]]. Arnulf sets out to establish his authority in [[Spoleto]], but suffers a [[stroke]]; he is forced to call off the campaign, and returns to [[Bavaria]].
* [[March]] &amp;ndash; King [[Lambert of Italy|Lambert II]] proceeds to re-conquer Italy. Heading north, he captures western [[Lombardy]], and [[Decapitation|decapitates]] count Maginulf of Milan. In the meantime, the deposed king [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar I]] recovers [[Verona]] ([[March of Friuli]]) from Arnulf's candidate, count [[Walfred of Friuli|Walfred of Verona]], who dies in office with &quot;great fidelity to the emperor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, Timothy (trans.) ''[http://www.medievalsources.co.uk/fulda.htm The Annals of Fulda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226063634/http://www.medievalsources.co.uk/fulda.htm |date=February 26, 2010 }}''.

* [[November]] &amp;ndash; Lambert II and Berengar I agree to sign a treaty at [[Pavia]]. Berengar receives the [[realm]] between the [[Adda River, Italy|Adda]] and the [[Po (river)|Po]], while the rest stays under the control of Lambert (including the [[March of Tuscany]]). They share [[Bergamo]], and Lambert pledges to marry Gisela, Berengar's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Sismondi, ''History of the Italian Republics in the Middle Ages'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prince [[Klonimir]], pretender to the [[throne]] of the [[Principality of Serbia (early medieval)|Serbian Principality]], is defeated by his ruling cousin, [[Petar of Serbia|Petar]].

      <text bytes="6900" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Combined gross national product of all the countries in the world}}
The '''gross world product''' ('''GWP''') is the combined [[gross national income]] of [[List of sovereign states|all the countries in the world]]. Because imports and exports balance exactly when considering the whole world, this also equals the total global [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;See [[measures of national income and output]] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Bank]], the 2013 nominal GWP was approximately [[US$]] 75.59 trillion.&lt;ref name=WB/&gt; In 2017, according to the [[CIA]]'s ''[[CIA World Factbook|World Factbook]]'', the GWP was around US $80.27 trillion in nominal terms and totaled approximately 127.8 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international dollars]] in terms of [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP).&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; The [[per capita]] PPP GWP in 2017 was approximately Int$17,500 according to the ''World Factbook''.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |title=World Factbook |work= [[CIA World Factbook]] |date=24 July 2019 |accessdate=24 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent growth==
The table below gives regional percentage values for overall GWP growth from 2006 through 2020, as well as an estimate for 2021, according to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)'s [[World Economic Outlook]] database. Data is given in terms of constant year-on-year prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|year=2020|title=World Economic Outlook, October 2020: A Long and Difficult Ascent|url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2020/October/weo-report?a=1&amp;c=001,110,163,119,123,998,200,505,511,903,205,400,603,&amp;s=NGDP_RPCH,&amp;sy=2006&amp;ey=2021&amp;ssm=0&amp;scsm=1&amp;scc=0&amp;ssd=1&amp;ssc=0&amp;sic=0&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=|work=[[World Economic Outlook]]|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and prehistorical estimates==

In 1998, economic historian [[J. Bradford DeLong]] estimated the total GWP in 1990 U.S. dollars for the main years between one million years BC and 2000 AD (shown in the table below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holtz.org/Library/Social%20Science/Economics/Estimating%20World%20GDP%20by%20DeLong/Estimating%20World%20GDP.htm|title=Estimating World GDP, One Million B.C. – Present|author=J. Bradford DeLong|date=24 May 1998|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nominal GWP estimates from 2005 onwards are also shown in contemporary U.S. dollars, according to estimates from the ''CIA World Factbook'' and the World Bank.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; &quot;Billion&quot; in the table below refers to the [[Long and short scales|short scale]] usage of the term, where 1 billion = 1,000 million = 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;!--This table is meant to be mostly comparative, so don't update it every single year – maybe once every five years (e.g. 2012, 2017, 2022), otherwise it will soon become far too long --&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''904''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CMIV]]''') was a [[leap year starting on Sunday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]].

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* [[July 29]] &amp;ndash; [[Sack of Thessalonica (904)|Sack of Thessalonica]]: A Muslim fleet, led by the Greek renegade [[Leo of Tripoli]], appears outside [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]] and begins its attack after a short and silent inspection of the fortification of the city. After attacks from the sea for two days, the [[Saracens]] are able to storm the city walls, overcome the Thessalonians' resistance and capture the city. The sacking continues for a full week, before the raiders depart for their base in the [[Levant]]. Having freed 4,000 Muslim prisoners and captured 60 ships, gaining a large loot, they carry off 22,000 men and woman as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Faith and Sword: A short history of Christian-Muslim conflict by Alan G. Jamieson, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Arab–Byzantine wars|Arab–Byzantine War]]: The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] under [[Andronikos Doukas (general under Leo VI)|Andronikos Doukas]], along with [[Eustathios Argyros (general under Leo VI)|Eustathios Argyros]], campaign against the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] and defeat the Muslim [[garrison]]s of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], near [[Kahramanmaraş|Marash]] (modern [[Turkey]]).
* Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] ('''the Wise''') is forced to sign a [[peace treaty]] with [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], ruler (''[[knyaz]]'') of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]]. All [[Slavs|Slavic]]-inhabited lands of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and southern [[Albania]] are ceded to the Bulgarians.

==== Europe ====
* Summer &amp;ndash; King [[Louis the Child|Louis IV]] ('''the Child''') invites [[Kurszán]], a [[Principality of Hungary|Hungarian]] leader (''[[gyula (title)|gyula]]'') of the [[Magyar tribes|Magyar tribal]] confederation, and his entourage to negotiate at the [[Fischa|Fischa River]], but they are killed in an [[ambush]]. 
* In [[County of Portugal|Portugal]], for the third time in less than 30 years, the Christians take control of [[Coimbra]], this time for almost a century.&lt;ref name=picard2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Picard|first=Christophe|title=Le Portugal musulman (VIIIe-XIIIe siècle). L'Occident d'al-Andalus sous domination islamique|year=2000|publisher=Maisonneuve &amp; Larose|location=Paris|isbn=2-7068-1398-9|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Britain ====
* Prince [[Hywel Dda|Hywel ap Cadell]] of [[Seisyllwg]] ([[Wales]]) marries Princess Elen of [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]]. The latter's father, King [[Llywarch ap Hyfaidd]], dies. The [[throne]] of Dyfed is claimed by Llywarch's brother, [[Rhodri ap Hyfaidd]], but he is probably forced to flee from Hywel's armies.

==== Arabian Empire ====
* Winter &amp;ndash; [[Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]] succeeds his nephew [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh]] as [[emir]] of the [[Tulunids|Tulunid Dynasty]], who is killed in a [[mutiny]] during the invasion of [[Egypt in the Middle Ages#Tulunids, second Abbasid period, and Ikhsidids|Egypt]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].

==== China ====
* [[September 22]] &amp;ndash; The warlord [[Zhu Wen|Zhu Quanzhong]] kills Emperor [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Zhao Zong]], along with his family and many ministers, after seizing control of the imperial government. Zhu places Zhao Zong's 13-year-old son [[Emperor Ai of Tang|Ai]] ('''Li Zhou''') on the imperial throne as a [[puppet ruler]] of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]].
* Zhu Quanzhong has [[Chang'an]], the capital of the Tang Dynasty and the largest city in the ancient world, destroyed, and moves the materials to Luoyang, which becomes the new capital.

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* [[January 29]] &amp;ndash; Pope [[Pope Sergius III|Sergius III]] succeeds [[Pope Leo V|Leo V]] and the deposed Antipope [[Antipope Christopher|Christopher]] (both of whom are murdered or [[exile]]d) as the 119th [[pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. The ascension of Sergius marks the beginning of the [[Saeculum obscurum|Pornocracy]] ('rule of the whores'), which will last for 150 years. During this time, the [[clergy]] will be sidelined and rule over [[Rome]] is dominated by the Roman [[nobility]].
* Sergius III allies himself with [[Theophylact I, Count of Tusculum|Theophylact I]], count of [[Tusculum]], who becomes ruler of Rome and the papal administration. Sergius rewards him (for his support and rise of power) with the position of ''[[Vestararius|sacri palatii vestararius]]'' and essentially becomes his puppet.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
== Births ==
* [[September 10]] &amp;ndash; [[Guo Wei]], emperor of [[Later Zhou]] (d. [[954]])
* [[Æthelwold of Winchester|Æthelwold]], bishop of [[Diocese of Winchester|Winchester]] (or [[909]])
* [[Egill Skallagrímsson]], Viking warrior and poet (approximate date)
* [[Yongming Yanshou]], Chinese [[Zen]] master (d. [[975]])

In [[probability theory|probability]], and [[statistics]], a '''multivariate random variable''' or '''random vector''' is a list of mathematical [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]s each of whose value is unknown, either because the value has not yet occurred or because there is imperfect knowledge of its value.  The individual variables in a random vector are grouped together because they are all part of a single mathematical system — often they represent different properties of an individual [[statistical unit]]. For example, while a given person has a specific age, height and weight, the representation of these features of ''an unspecified person'' from within a group would be a random vector. Normally each element of a random vector is a [[real number]]. 

Random vectors are often used as the underlying implementation of various types of aggregate [[random variable]]s, e.g. a [[random matrix]], [[random tree]], [[random sequence]], [[stochastic process]], etc.

More formally, a multivariate random variable is a [[column vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}=(X_1,...,X_n)^T &lt;/math&gt; (or its [[transpose]], which is a [[row vector]]) whose components are [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]-valued [[random variable]]s on the same [[probability space]] as each other, &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[sample space]], &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[sigma-algebra]] (the collection of all events), and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[probability measure]] (a function returning each event's [[probability]]).

==Probability distribution==
{{main|Multivariate probability distribution}}
Every random vector gives rise to a probability measure on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with the [[Borel algebra]] as the underlying sigma-algebra. This measure is also known as the [[joint probability distribution]], the joint distribution, or the multivariate distribution of the random vector.

The [[Probability distribution|distributions]] of each of the component random variables &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; are called [[marginal distribution]]s. The [[conditional probability distribution]] of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;X_j&lt;/math&gt; is the probability distribution of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;X_j&lt;/math&gt; is known to be a particular value.

The '''cumulative distribution function''' &lt;math&gt;F_{\mathbf{X}} : \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of a random vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}=(X_1,...,X_n)^T &lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;ref name=Gallager&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert G. |last=Gallager|year=2013 |title=Stochastic Processes Theory for Applications |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-03975-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.15}}

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = (x_1,...,x_n)^T&lt;/math&gt;.

==Operations on random vectors==
Random vectors can be subjected to the same kinds of [[Euclidean vector#Basic properties|algebraic operations]] as can non-random vectors: addition, subtraction, multiplication by a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], and the taking of [[Dot product|inner products]].

===Affine transformations===
Similarly, a new random vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined by applying an [[affine transformation]] &lt;math&gt;g\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; to a random vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}=\mathcal{A}\mathbf{X}+b&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n \times  n&lt;/math&gt; matrix and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n \times  1&lt;/math&gt; column vector.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an invertible matrix and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; has a probability density function &lt;math&gt;f_{\mathbf{X}}&lt;/math&gt;, then the probability density of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is

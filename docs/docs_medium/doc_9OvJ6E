[[File:Petersinai.jpg|thumb|A 6th-century encaustic icon from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], [[Egypt]].]]

'''Encaustic painting''', also known as '''hot wax painting''', involves using heated [[beeswax]] to which colored [[pigment]]s are added. The liquid or paste is then applied to a surface&amp;mdash;usually prepared wood, though [[canvas]] and other materials are often used. The simplest encaustic mixture can be made from adding pigments to beeswax, but there are several other recipes that can be used&amp;mdash;some containing other types of [[wax]]es, [[damar resin]], [[linseed oil]], or other ingredients.  Pure, powdered pigments can be used, though some mixtures use oil paints or other forms of pigment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eainm.com/what-is-encaustic/|title=What Is Encaustic?|work=Encaustic Art Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal tools and special brushes can be used to shape the paint before it cools, or heated metal tools can be used to manipulate the wax once it has cooled onto the surface.  Today, tools such as heat lamps, heat guns, and other methods of applying heat allow artists to extend the amount of time they have to work with the material. Because wax is used as the pigment binder, encaustics can be sculpted as well as painted.  Other materials can be encased or [[collage]]d into the surface, or layered, using the encaustic medium to stick them to the surface.

A completely unrelated type of &quot;encaustic painting&quot;, not involving wax at all, is found in British ceramics, after [[Josiah Wedgwood]] devised and patented the technique in 1769.  This was a mixture of [[Slip (ceramics)|ceramic slip]] and [[overglaze]] &quot;enamel&quot; paints used to imitate [[ancient Greek vase painting]], and given a light second firing.  Usually the vessel was black and painted in the red of [[red-figure painting]].  The technique was copied by other British potteries.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 51; [http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O77416/bulb-pot-and-josiah-wedgwood-and/ &quot;Bulb pot and cover&quot;], V&amp;A Museum&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Encaustic tile]]s are not painted at all, but effectively inlaid with contrasting colours of clay for a [[polychrome]] pattern.

== History ==
[[File:EncausticPortraitWoman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Fayum mummy portrait]]

The word encaustic originates from the Greek word ''enkaustikos''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | chapter=Encaustic | title=The Oxford American Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt; which means to burn in, and this element of heat is necessary for a painting to be called encaustic.

The wax encaustic painting technique was described by the Roman scholar [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' from the 1st Century AD.{{sfn|Pliny the Elder|1885|loc= Book 35, ch 41}} The oldest surviving encaustic panel paintings are the Romano-Egyptian [[Fayum mummy portraits]] from [[Egypt]] around 100–300 AD,{{sfn|Doxiadis|1995|p=193}} but was a very common technique in ancient Greek and Roman painting.  It continued to be used in early [[Byzantine art|Byzantine icons]] but was effectively abandoned in the Western Church.

Kut-kut, a lost art of the [[Philippines]], employs [[sgraffito]] and encaustic techniques. It was practiced by the indigenous tribe of [[Samar]] island around 1600 to 1800.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABS-CBN News2008&quot; /&gt; Artists in the [[Mexican muralism]] movement, such as [[Diego Rivera]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gallery.sjsu.edu/arth198/painting/encaustic.html |title=Painting: Encaustic |accessdate=2011-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513061000/http://gallery.sjsu.edu/arth198/painting/encaustic.html |archive-date=May 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Charlot]]{{sfn|Charlot|1998}} sometimes used encaustic painting. The Belgian artist [[James Ensor]] also experimented with encaustic.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Fireworks&quot;, 1887, James Ensor (see &quot;James Ensor&quot; MoMA, New York, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Mummy of Demetrios, 95-100 C.E.,11.600a-b.jpg|thumbnail|The Mummy of Demetrios, 95-100 C.E.,11.600a-b, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
In the 20th century, painter [[Fritz Faiss]] (1905–1981), a student of [[Paul Klee]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]] at the [[Bauhaus]], together with Dr. Hans Schmid, rediscovered the so-called &quot;Punic wax&quot; technique of encaustic painting. Faiss held two German patents related to the preparation of waxes for encaustic painting. One covered a method for treating beeswax so that its melting point was raised from {{convert|60|to|100|C}}. This occurred after boiling the wax in a solution of sea water and soda three successive times. The resulting harder wax is the same as the Punic wax referred to in ancient Greek writings on encaustic painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reams |first=Maxine |date=October 19, 1952 |title=Unique Wax Paintings by Immigrant Artist Should Endure 10,000 Years |work=Los Angeles Times |page=G14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Fritz Faiss Encaustic Work Shown |work=Los Angeles Times |page=D6 |date=February 3, 1952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other 20th-century North American artists, including [[Jasper Johns]], [[Tony Scherman]], Mark Perlman, and [[Fernando Leal Audirac]] have used encaustic techniques.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Encaustic art has seen a resurgence in popularity since the 1990s with people using electric irons, hotplates and heated styli on different surfaces including card, paper and even pottery. The iron makes producing a variety of artistic patterns easier. The medium is not limited to just simple designs; it can be used to create complex paintings, just as in other media such as [[oil painting|oil]] and [[Acrylic painting techniques|acrylic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mayer|first1=Ralph|title=Encaustic Painting - Ralph Mayer|url=http://www.abstract-art.com/RonDavis/b_shows/b4_loyd/w31_encaustic_ptg.html|website=www.abstract-art.com|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although technically difficult to master, attractions of this medium for contemporary artists are its dimensional quality and luminous color.&lt;ref&gt;Gianquinto, Michael A., Cape Cod Museum Curator of Art.

'''New materials in 20th-century art''' were introduced to art making from the very beginning of the century. The introduction of new materials (and techniques) and heretofore non-art materials helped drive change in art during the 20th century. Traditional materials and techniques were not necessarily displaced in the 20th century. Rather, they functioned alongside innovations that came with the 20th century. Such mainstays as [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting, and sculpting in traditional materials continued right through the 20th century into the 21st century. Furthermore, even &quot;traditional&quot; materials were greatly expanded in the course of the 20th century. The number of pigments available to artists (painters, primarily) has increased both in quantity and quality, by most reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Mayer, The Painter's Craft, {{ISBN|0-14-046895-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; New formulations for traditional materials especially the commercial availability of [[acrylic paint]] have become widely used, introducing initial issues over their stability and longevity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenpaints.com/company/history.php History of Golden paints], retrieved July 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Joseph Cornell]] and others incorporated paper [[collage]] and mixed drawing (materials) with [[paint]] to fashion their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archivedate=2008-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Picasso and [[Marcel Duchamp]] pioneered the use of [[found objects]] as material for paintings and sculpture during the 1910s. In the 1940s [[Jackson Pollock]] pioneered the use of housepaint, silver and aluminum paint, duco, and various objects for use in his paintings. In the 1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] included [[dimension|3-D]] elements like tires and stuffed animals
as well as using discarded materials like crushed or flattened [[cardboard box]]es. [[Yves Klein]] incorporated live nude models and a symphony orchestra in his performance pieces of his paintings. [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]] used crushed auto parts for sculpture. In the 1960s [[Pop Art|Pop artists]] [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] made art from commercial products, or art that resembled commercial products like television sets, soup cans, brillo boxes, comic books, household furniture and restaurant items among other things. [[Edward Kienholz]] made replicas of actual environments both domestic and commercial, while [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]] made life-size plaster figures in settings using real objects and props. [[Dan Flavin]] used electric [[fluorescent light]]s and [[Electrical ballast|ballast]]s to create sculpture. In the 1970s [[Frank Stella]] introduced honeycombed aluminum and glitter. In the 1980s [[Julian Schnabel]] made &quot;plate paintings&quot; with broken [[crockery]] stuck to the surface and then painted over, [[Anselm Kiefer]] and [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] used [[mud]], [[soil]] or [[tar]] in their works. In the 1960s and again in the 1990s artists used [[excrement]] notably - the Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]] in 1961 and the British artist [[Chris Ofili]] who specialized in using [[elephant]] dung in the 1990s. [[Tracey Emin]] included her bed, entitled [[My Bed]], in 1999.

Some innovations concerning materials used in art merely function in a supportive way, and other innovative materials are much more conspicuous. [[Frank Stella]]'s use of honeycombed aluminum served as a lightweight and strong and very configurable support for imagery. In the sculpture entitled &quot;Monogram,&quot; by [[Robert Rauschenberg]], an [[angora goat]] assumes a position of central importance.

==Early 20th century==
[[Image:Compotier avec fruits, violon et verre.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''Compotier avec fruits, violon et verre,'' 1912]]
The advent of [[Modernism]] and [[Modern Art]] in the first decades of the 20th century inspired artists to test and transcend the boundaries and the limitations of the traditional and conventional forms of art making in search of newer forms and in search of new materials. The innovations of painters like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and the French [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolists]] provided essential inspiration for the development of modern art by the younger generation of artists in Paris and elsewhere in Europe. [[Henri Matisse]] and other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with &quot;wild&quot;, multi-colored, expressive, paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and scores of young artists in Paris made their first modern paintings venturing toward [[Abstract art|abstraction]] and other new ways of formulating [[figurative art|figurative]], [[still-life]] and [[landscape art|landscape]] imagery.

===1900s===
During the first decade of the 20th century modern art developed simultaneously in several different areas in Europe (France, England, Scandinavia, Russia, Germany, Italy), and in the United States. Artists began to formulate different directions of modern art, seemingly unrelated to one another.

In [[printmaking]], the [[linocut]] was invented by the artists of [[Die Brücke]] in Germany between 1905 and 1913.  At first they described their prints as [[woodcut]]s, which sounded more respectable. The technique remains popular as a very simple method of printmaking, even suitable for use in schools.

===1910s===

====Cubism====

Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Juan Gris and other [[Cubism|cubist]] artists introduced new elements and materials like newspaper clippings, fabric, and sheet music into their paintings. Eventually the movement was called [[Synthetic Cubism]] developed between 1912 and 1919. Synthetic cubism is characterized by works with different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of subject matter. It was the beginning of collage materials being introduced as an important ingredient of fine art work by the [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Cooper, &quot;The Cubist Epoch&quot;, pp. 11–221, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered the first work of this new style was Pablo Picasso's ''&quot;Still Life with Chair-caning&quot;'' (1911–1912), which includes oil cloth that was printed to look like chair-caning pasted onto an oval canvas, with text; and rope framing the whole picture. At the upper left are the letters &quot;JOU&quot;, which appear in many cubist paintings and refers to the newspaper titled ''&quot;Le Journal&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Richardson (art historian)|Richardson, John]]. ''A Life Of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel 1907–1916.'' New York: [[Alfred A. Knopf]], 1991, p.225. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dada====
The [[Dada]] movement began during [[World War I]] as a protest against the madness and violence of war. Applying shock tactics and anarchy to art the Dadaists pioneered the use of new artistic techniques such as [[collage]], [[photomontage]] [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] and the use of [[found objects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4059997.stm &quot;Duchamp's urinal tops art survey&quot;], [[BBC News]] December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]] and others incorporated into their work random everyday objects often combined with more conventional artist materials. They included photographs, panes of glass, picture frames, eyeglasses, boxes, newspapers, magazines, ticket stubs, metal pipes, bulbs, bottle racks, urinals, bicycle wheels and other objects. [[Marcel Duchamp]] created ''The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even,'' working on the piece from 1915 to 1923. He made the work on two panes of glass; with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Janis: [http://www.artchive.com/artchive/D/duchamp.html ''Marcel Duchamp, 1887–1968: Art as Anti-Art''] as reproduced at artchive.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s===

====Surrealism====
During the 1930s [[Surrealist]] artist [[Méret Oppenheim]] created sexually charged erotic pieces. Oppenheim's best known piece is ''[[Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)]]'' (1936). The sculpture consists of a teacup, saucer and spoon that the artist covered with fur from a Chinese gazelle.  It is displayed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.

====American Modernism====

{{main|Fluxus|Neo-Dada|Assemblage (art)|Happenings|Intermedia}}

===1950s===
[[Robert Rauschenberg]] began to create what became known as his [[Combine painting]]s in the early 1950s.

===1960s===
In 1960 [[Yves Klein]] incorporated live nude models and a symphony orchestra in his performance pieces of his paintings. [[Yves Klein|Klein]] also made use of [[Photomontage]] in the famous pseudo-performance picture of himself diving off a wall onto a [[Paris]] street ''Le Saut dans le Vide'' (Leap into the Void. In the 1960s [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]] continued using crushed auto parts for sculpture.  [[Dan Flavin]] used electric [[fluorescent light]]s and [[Electrical ballast|ballast]]s to create his sculpture. In May 1961 Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]] used his own [[excrement]], selling it in cans titled ''[[Artist's Shit]]'' (''Merda d'Artista'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/193259521X Poop Culture: How America is Shaped by its Grossest National Product] by Dave Praeger {{ISBN|1-932595-21-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the contents of the cans remain a much-disputed enigma, since opening them would destroy the value of the artwork. Various theories about the contents have been proposed, including speculation that it is plaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/visualart/story/0,,2101617,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Merde d'artiste: not exactly what it says on the tin | first=Jonathan | last=Glancey | date=June 13, 2007 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mother's Day''' is a celebration honoring the [[mother]] of the family, as well as [[motherhood]], [[maternal bond]]s, and the influence of mothers in society. It is celebrated on various days in many parts of the world, most commonly in the months of March or May.&lt;!-- Note: this means Mother’s Day falls in autumn in most of South America, South Africa, Australia, and N.Z.; see list &quot;Dates around the world&quot;. --&gt; It complements similar celebrations honoring family members, such as [[Father's Day]], [[Siblings Day]], and [[National Grandparents Day|Grandparents Day]].

The modern Mother's Day began in the [[United States]], at the initiative of [[Anna Jarvis]] in the early 20th century. It is not directly related to the many traditional celebrations of mothers and motherhood that have existed throughout the world over thousands of years, such as the Greek cult to [[Cybele]], the mother god [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], the Roman festival of [[Hilaria]], or the Christian [[Laetare Sunday]] celebration (associated with the image of [[Mother Church]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;grold&quot;&gt;{{citation |title= Mother's Day |author=L.

'The idea is imported,. America led the way.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some countries, Mother's Day is still synonymous with these older traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{citation |title= Mothering Sunday |publisher= [[BBC]] |accessdate=4 March 2010 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/motheringsunday_1.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American version of Mother's Day has been criticized for having become too commercialized.&lt;ref name=why/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/mothers-day-2017-uk-date-facts-traditions/ Mother's Day 2017], ''The Daily Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; Founder Jarvis herself regretted this [[commercialism]] and expressed that this was never her intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/13/us/mothers-day-anna-jarvis-trnd/index.html|title=Mother's Day founder later came to regret it|last=Trammell|first=Kendall |work=CNN|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Constance Adelaide Smith]] successfully advocated for [[Mothering Sunday]] as a commemoration of a broader definition of motherhood in many other parts of the [[English-speaking world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dunning |first1=Andrew |title=The medieval origins of Mothering Sunday |url=https://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2017/03/the-medieval-origins-of-mothering-sunday.html |website=Medieval manuscripts blog |publisher=The British Library |date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

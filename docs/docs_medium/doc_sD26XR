==Geography==
From 2500&amp;nbsp;m above sea level on [[Paektu Mountain]] on the [[China–North Korea border]], the river flows south to [[Hyesan]] before sweeping 130&amp;nbsp;km northwest to [[Linjiang]] and then returning to a more southerly route for a further 300&amp;nbsp;km to empty into the [[Korea Bay]] between [[Dandong]] (China) and [[Sinuiju]] (North Korea). The bordering Chinese provinces are [[Jilin]] and [[Liaoning]].

The river is 795&amp;nbsp;km (493&amp;nbsp;mi) long and receives water from over 30,000&amp;nbsp;km² of land. The Yalu's most significant [[tributaries]] are the Changjin ({{Korean|장진강|長津江|labels=no}}), the Hochon ({{Korean|허천강|虛川江|labels=no}}), the Togro ({{Korean|독로강|禿魯江|labels=no}}) rivers from Korea and the [[Ai River (Dandong)|Ai (or Aihe)]] ({{lang|zh|璦河}})  and the [[Tongjia River|Hun]] ({{lang|zh|浑江}}) from China. The river is not easily navigable for most of its length.&lt;ref&gt;Entire paragraph taken from Earth Snapshot Website. (March 25, 2011).

The depth of the Yalu River varies from some of the more shallow parts on the eastern side in Hyesan (1 m) to the deeper parts of the river near the Yellow Sea (2.5 m).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. (December 5, 2011). Yalu River.

About 205 islands are on the Yalu. A 1962 border treaty between North Korea and China split the islands according to which ethnic group was living on each island. North Korea possesses 127 and China 78. Due to the division criteria, some islands such as [[Hwanggumpyong Island]] belong to North Korea, but abut the Chinese side of the river.

==History==
The river basin is the site where the ancient Korean kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] (고구려, 高句麗) rose to power. Many former fortresses are located along the river and the former capital of that kingdom was situated at what is now the medium-sized city of [[Ji'an, Jilin]] along the Yalu, a site rich in Goguryeo era relics.{{Citation needed|date = October 2017}}

[[Wihwa Island]] on the river is historically famous as the place where, in 1388, General Yi Songgye (later [[Taejo of Joseon]]) decided to [[Wihwado Retreat|turn back his army southward]] to [[Kaesong]] in the first of a series of revolts that eventually led to the establishment of the [[House of Yi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/06/10/2011061001158.html |title=What Is Hwanggumpyong Island? |author=Jeong Woo-sang |publisher=Digital Chosun |date=10 June 2011 |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The river has been the site of several battles because of its strategic location between Korea and China, including:

* [[Battle of the Yalu River (1894)]] – [[First Sino-Japanese War]]
* [[Battle of Yalu River (1904)]] – [[Russo-Japanese War]]
* [[Battle of Chongju (1950)|Battle near to the Yalu River (1950)]] – [[Korean War]]

The southern side of the river was heavily industrialized during the period of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1910–1945), and by 1945 almost 20% of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s total industrial output originated in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. 

During the [[Korean War]], the movement of [[United Nations]] troops approaching the river precipitated massive Chinese intervention from around [[Dandong]]. In the course of the conflict every bridge across the river except one was destroyed. The one remaining bridge was the [[Sino–Korean Friendship Bridge]] connecting [[Sinuiju]], North Korea to [[Dandong]], China. During the war the valley surrounding the western end of the river also became the focal point of a series of [[dogfight]]s for [[air superiority]] over North Korea, earning the nickname &quot;[[MiG Alley]]&quot; in reference to the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] flown by the combined North Korean, Chinese, and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces.{{Citation needed|date = October 2017}} As UN forces during the Korean War advanced toward the Yalu, China under Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] entered the war on the side of North Korea.{{Citation needed|date = October 2017}}

The river has frequently been crossed by North Koreans fleeing to China since the early 1990s, although the [[Tumen River]] remains the most-used way for such refugees.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyqUw0WYwoc&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

According to one scholar, the Korean-Chinese border along the Yalu River is the longest unchanged international border in history, lasting for at least 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2020/06/739_287299.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pressreader.com/korea-republic/the-korea-times/20200405/281646782251441&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc4s2it6HVE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBHRaYuHP4A&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The river is important for [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power, and one of the largest hydroelectric [[dam]]s in Asia is in [[Sup'ung Dam]], 106&amp;nbsp;m high and over 850&amp;nbsp;m long, located upstream from [[Sinuiju]], [[North Korea]]. The dam has created an artificial lake over a portion of the river, called [[Supung Lake]]. In addition, the river is used for transportation, particularly of lumber from its forested banks. The river provides fish for the local population. Downstream of Sup'ung is the [[Taipingwan Dam]]. Upstream of Sup'ung is the [[Unbong Dam]]. Both dams produce hydroelectric power, as well.

In the river delta upstream from [[Dandong]] and adjacent to [[Hushan]] are several North Korean villages. Economic conditions in these villages have been described as poor, without access to electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://visitthedprk.org/north-korea-dandong-yalu-river-boatride/| title=We took a boatride on the Yalu River across the Sino-Korean Border.

He was the [[Romanian Communist Party#General Secretaries (1921–1989)|general secretary]] of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] from 1965 to 1989, and the second and last [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist leader]] of Romania. He was also the country's head of state from 1967, serving as President of the [[State Council of Romania|State Council]] and from 1974 concurrently as [[President of Romania|President of the Republic]], until his overthrow and execution in the [[Romanian Revolution]] in December 1989, part of a series of [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] and [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] uprisings in [[Eastern Europe]] that year.

Born in 1918 in [[Scornicești]], [[Olt County]], Ceaușescu was a member of the Romanian Communist youth movement. Ceaușescu rose up through the ranks of [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]]'s Socialist government and, upon Gheorghiu-Dej's death in 1965, he succeeded to the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party as general secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Behr, E. (1991). ''Kiss the hand you cannot bite: the rise and fall of the Ceaușescus''. London: Hamish Hamilton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his rise to power, he eased [[Censorship in Communist Romania|press censorship]] and openly condemned the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in his [[Ceaușescu's speech of 21 August 1968|speech on 21 August 1968]], which resulted in a surge in popularity. However, the resulting period of stability was very brief as his government very soon became severely [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and was considered the most repressive in the [[Eastern Bloc]] at the time. His [[secret police]], the [[Securitate]], was responsible for [[mass surveillance]] as well as [[Securitate#Method|severe repression]] and human rights abuses within the country, and he suppressed and controlled the media and press, implementing methods that were among the harshest, most restrictive and brutal in the world. Economic mismanagement due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s led to skyrocketing foreign debts for Romania. In 1982, he exported much of the country's agricultural and industrial production in an effort to repay them. The shortages that followed drastically lowered living standards, leading to [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|heavy rationing of food, water, oil, heat, electricity, medicine and other necessities]]. [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|His cult of personality]] experienced unprecedented elevation, followed by extensive [[nepotism]] and the intense deterioration of foreign relations, even with the [[Soviet Union]].

As anti-government protesters demonstrated in [[Timișoara]] in December 1989, he perceived the demonstrations as a political threat and ordered military forces to open fire on 17 December, causing many deaths and injuries. The revelation that Ceaușescu was responsible resulted in a massive spread of rioting and civil unrest across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicolae-Ceausescu |title=Nicolae Ceaușescu – president of Romania |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrations, which reached Bucharest, became known as the [[Romanian Revolution]]—the only violent overthrow of a communist government in the turn of the [[Revolutions of 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;Ratesh, N. (1991). Romania: The Entangled Revolution.

Capital punishment was abolished shortly thereafter.

==Early life and career==

Ceaușescu was born in the small village of [[Scornicești]], [[Olt County]] on {{OldStyleDate|8 February|1918|26 January|}}, being the third of nine children of a poor peasant family (see [[Ceaușescu family]]).

Journalist Cătălin Gruia claimed in 2007 that he ran away from his supposedly extremely religious, abusive and strict father. He initially lived with his sister, Niculina Rusescu, and then became an [[apprentice]] [[shoemaker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

He worked in the workshop of Alexandru Săndulescu, a shoemaker who was an active member in the then-illegal Communist Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Ceaușescu was soon involved in the Communist Party activities (becoming a member in early 1932), but as a teenager he was given only small tasks.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; He was first arrested in 1933, at the age of 15, for street fighting during a strike and again, in 1934, first for collecting signatures on a petition protesting the trial of railway workers and twice more for other similar activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceausescu.org/ceausescu_texts/ceausescu_chronology.htm|title=www.ceausescu.org – the leading infosource on the web about Ceausescu and his era!|access-date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s, he had been in missions in Bucharest, [[Craiova]], [[Câmpulung]] and [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]], being arrested several times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gruia43&quot;&gt;Gruia, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The profile file from the secret police, [[Siguranța Statului]], named him &quot;a dangerous Communist agitator&quot; and &quot;distributor of Communist and antifascist propaganda materials&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gruia43&quot;/&gt; For these charges, he was convicted on 6 June 1936 by the Brașov Tribunal to 2 years in prison, an additional 6 months for [[contempt of court]], and one year of forced residence in Scornicești.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gruia43&quot;/&gt; He spent most of his sentence in [[Doftana Prison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gruia43&quot;/&gt; While out of jail in 1939, he met [[Elena Ceaușescu|Elena Petrescu]], whom he married in 1947 and who would play an increasing role in his political life over the years.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt;

Soon after being freed, he was arrested again and sentenced for &quot;conspiracy against social order&quot;, spending the time during the war in prisons and [[Internment|internment camp]]s: [[Jilava]] (1940), [[Caransebeș]] (1942), [[Văcăreşti prison|Văcărești]] (1943), and Târgu Jiu (1943).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gruia43&quot; /&gt; In 1943, he was transferred to [[Târgu Jiu]] [[Internment|internment camp]], where he shared a cell with [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], becoming his protégé. Enticed with substantial bribes, the camp authorities gave the Communist prisoners much freedom in running their cell block, provided they did not attempt to break out of prison.&lt;ref&gt;Behr, Edward ''Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite'', New York: Villard Books, 1991 pages 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; At Târgu Jiu, Gheorghiu-Dej ran &quot;self-criticism sessions&quot; where various Party members had to confess before the other Party members to misunderstanding the dogma of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin as interpreted by Gheorghiu-Dej; journalist [[Edward Behr (journalist)|Edward Behr]] claimed that Ceaușescu's role in these &quot;self-criticism sessions&quot; was that of the enforcer, the young man allegedly beating those Party members who refused to go with or were insufficiently enthusiastic about the &quot;self-criticism&quot; sessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Behr, Edward pages 181-186&quot;&gt;Behr, Edward ''Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite'', New York: Villard Books, 1991 pages 181–186.&lt;/ref&gt; These &quot;self-criticism sessions&quot; not only helped to cement Gheorghiu-Dej's control over the Party, but also endeared his protégé Ceaușescu to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Behr, Edward pages 181-186&quot; /&gt; It was Ceaușescu's time at Târgu Jiu that marked the beginning of his rise to power.  After [[World War II]], when Romania was beginning to fall under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence, Ceaușescu served as secretary of the [[Union of Communist Youth]] (1944–1945).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;

After the Communists seized power in Romania in 1947, he headed the ministry of agriculture, then served as deputy minister of the armed forces under Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, becoming a major-general. In 1952, Gheorghiu-Dej brought him onto the [[Central Committee]] months after the party's &quot;Muscovite faction&quot; led by [[Ana Pauker]] had been purged. In the late 1940s-early 1950s, the Party had been divided into the &quot;home communists&quot; headed by Gheorghiu-Dej who remained inside Romania prior to 1944 and the &quot;Muscovites&quot; who had gone into exile in the Soviet Union. With the partial exception of Poland, where the [[Polish October]] crisis of 1956 brought to power the previously imprisoned &quot;home communist&quot; [[Władysław Gomułka]], Romania was the only Eastern European nation where the &quot;home communists&quot; triumphed over the &quot;Muscovites&quot;. In the rest of the Soviet bloc, there were a series of purges in this period that led to the &quot;home communists&quot; being executed or imprisoned. Like his patron Gheorghiu-Dej, Ceaușescu was a &quot;home communist&quot; who benefited from the fall of the &quot;Muscovites&quot; in 1952. In 1954, Ceaușescu became a full member of the Politburo and eventually rose to occupy the second-highest position in the party hierarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;

==Leadership of Romania==
When Gheorghiu-Dej died on 19 March 1965, Ceaușescu was not the obvious successor despite his closeness to the longtime leader. However, widespread infighting by older and more connected officials made the Politburo turn to Ceaușescu as a compromise candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revolution1989&quot; /&gt; He was elected general secretary on 22 March 1965, three days after Gheorghiu-Dej's death.

One of his first acts was to change the name of the party from the Romanian Workers' Party back to the [[Communist Party of Romania]] and to declare the country a [[socialist republic]], rather than a [[people's republic]]. In 1967, he consolidated his power by becoming president of the [[State Council of Romania|State Council]], making him ''de jure'' head of state. His political apparatus sent many thousands of political opponents to prison or psychiatric hospitals.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

Initially, Ceaușescu became a popular figure, both in Romania and in the West, because of his independent foreign policy, which challenged the authority of the [[Soviet Union]]. In the 1960s, he eased press censorship and ended Romania's active participation in the Warsaw Pact, but Romania formally remained a member. He refused to take part in the [[Prague Spring|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]] by Warsaw Pact forces and even actively and openly condemned that action in his [[Ceaușescu's speech of 21 August 1968|21 August 1968 speech]]. He travelled to [[Prague]] a week before the invasion to offer moral support to his Czechoslovak counterpart, [[Alexander Dubček]]. Although the Soviet Union largely tolerated Ceaușescu's recalcitrance, his seeming independence from Moscow earned Romania a maverick status within the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;

Ceaușescu's main aim as leader was to make Romania a world power, and all of his economic, foreign and demographic policies were meant to achieve Ceaușescu's ultimate goal: turning Romania into one of the world's great powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crampton, Richard page 355&quot;&gt;Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe In the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 page 355.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1966, Ceaușescu [[Decree 770|banned abortion and contraception]] and brought in one of the world's harshest anti-abortion laws,&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Richard Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century-And After, London: Routledge, 1997 page 355.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a large spike in the number of Romanian infants abandoned to deplorable conditions in the [[Romanian orphans|country's orphanages]].

{{Technical|date=September 2019}}

[[File:PianoKeyboard.svg|thumb|Chromatic scale: every key of one octave on the piano keyboard]]

The '''chromatic scale''' or '''twelve-tone scale''' is a [[musical scale]] with twelve [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]es, each a [[semitone]] above or below its adjacent pitches. As a result, in [[12 tone equal temperament|12-tone equal temperament]] (the most common temperament in Western music), the chromatic scale covers all 12 of the available pitches. Thus, there is only one chromatic scale.{{efn|As every chromatic scale is [[transpositional equivalency|identical under transposition]], [[inversional equivalency|inversion]], and [[retrograde equivalency|retrograde]] to every other.}}

Moreover, in equal temperament, all the semitones have the same [[Interval (music)#Size|size]] (100 [[cent (music)|cents]]) and there are twelve semitones in an octave (1200 cents). As a result, the notes of an equal-tempered chromatic scale are equally-spaced.

{{Quote|The twelve notes of the octave—''all'' the black and white keys in one octave on the piano—form the '''chromatic scale'''. The tones of the chromatic scale (unlike those of the major or minor scale) are all the same distance apart, one half step.
The word ''chromatic'' comes from the Greek ''chroma'', ''color''; and the traditional function of the chromatic scale is to color or embellish the tones of the major and minor scales. It does not define a key, but it gives a sense of motion and tension. It has long been used to evoke grief, loss, or sorrow. In the twentieth century it has also become independent of major and minor scales and is used as the basis for entire compositions.|[[Roger Kamien]] (1976)&lt;ref&gt;Kamien, Roger (1990).

==Notation==

The chromatic scale has no set [[enharmonic spelling]] that is always used. Its spelling is, however, often dependent upon [[Major and minor|major or minor]] key signatures and whether the scale is ascending or descending. In general, the chromatic scale is usually notated with [[Sharp (music)|sharp signs]] when ascending and [[Flat (music)|flat signs]] when descending. It is also notated so that no [[Degree (music)|scale degree]] is used more than twice in succession (for instance, G{{music|flat}}&amp;nbsp;– G{{music|natural}}&amp;nbsp;– G{{music|sharp}}).

Similarly, some notes of the chromatic scale have enharmonic equivalents in [[solfege]]. The rising scale is Do, Di, Re, Ri, Mi, Fa, Fi, Sol, Si, La, Li, Ti and the descending is Ti, Te/Ta, La, Le/Lo, Sol, Se, Fa, Mi, Me/Ma, Re, Ra, Do, However, once 0 is given to a note, due to [[octave equivalence]], the chromatic scale may be indicated unambiguously by the numbers 0-11 [[modular arithmetic|mod twelve]]. Thus two perfect fifths are 0-7-2. [[Tone row]]s, orderings used in the [[twelve-tone technique]], are often considered this way due to the increase ease of comparing inverse intervals and forms ([[inversional equivalence]]).

==Pitch-rational tunings==
{{anchor|Tuning|Tunings}}
===Pythagorean===
{{Main|Pythagorean tuning}}

The most common conception of the chromatic scale before the 13th century was the [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean chromatic scale]] ({{audio|Shí èr lǜ on C.mid|Play}}). Due to a different tuning technique, the twelve semitones in this scale have two slightly different sizes. Thus, the scale is not perfectly symmetric. Many other [[tuning system]]s, developed in the ensuing centuries, share a similar asymmetry.

In Pythagorean tuning (i.e. 3-limit [[just intonation]]) the chromatic scale is tuned as follows, in perfect fifths from G{{music|b}} to A{{music|#}} centered on D (in bold) (G{{music|b}}-D{{music|b}}-A{{music|b}}-E{{music|b}}-B{{music|b}}-F-D-G-'''D'''-A-E-B-F{{music|#}}-C{{music|#}}-G{{music|#}}-D{{music|#}}-A{{music|#}}), with sharps ''higher'' than their [[enharmonic]] flats (cents rounded to one decimal):

Just intonation tuning can be approximated by [[19-EDO]] tuning (P5 = 11 steps = 694.74 cents).

==Non-Western cultures==
The ancient [[Music of China|Chinese]] chromatic scale is called ''[[Shí-èr-lǜ]]''. However, &quot;it should not be imagined that this [[Diatonic and chromatic#Diatonic scales|gamut]] ever functioned as a [[scale (music)|scale]], and it is erroneous to refer to the 'Chinese chromatic scale', as some Western writers have done. The series of twelve notes known as the twelve ''lü'' were simply a series of [[tonic (music)|fundamental notes]] from which scales could be constructed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Needham&quot;&gt;Needham, Joseph (1962/2004). ''Science and Civilization in China, Vol. IV: Physics and Physical Technology'', p.170-171. {{ISBN|978-0-521-05802-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, &quot;from the standpoint of tonal music [the chromatic scale]&lt;!--&quot;it&quot;--&gt; is not an independent scale, but derives from the diatonic scale,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Forte&quot;/&gt; making the ''Western chromatic scale'' a gamut of fundamental notes from which scales could be constructed as well.

'''St. Hedwig's Cathedral''' ({{lang-de|St.-Hedwigs-Kathedrale}}) is a [[Catholic Church in Germany|Catholic]] church on [[Bebelplatz]] in the [[Mitte (locality)|historic centre]] of Berlin. Dedicated to [[Hedwig of Silesia]], it was erected from 1747 to 1887 by order of [[Frederick the Great]] according to plans by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]] in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]]. Damaged during the [[Allied bombing of Berlin in World War II|Allied bombing in World War II]], the cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Berlin|Archdiocese of Berlin]] was restored from 1952 to 1963 in [[Modern_architecture#Postwar_modernism_in_Europe_(1945–1975)|post-war modernist style]] as part of the Forum Fridericianum. Since 2018, the [[listed building]] has been closed for renovation.

== History and architecture ==
[[File:St. Hedwigs Kathedrale Innenansicht.jpg|thumb|Interior in June 2014]]
St. Hedwig's Church was built in the 18th century following a request from local parishioners to King [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]]. He donated the land on which the church was built.&lt;ref name=history&gt;''St.Hedwigs Kathedrale Berlin : History''. Available at: http://www.hedwigs-kathedrale.de/en/hedwigs-kathedrale/history (Accessed: 19 October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The church was dedicated to the patron of [[Silesia]] and [[Brandenburg]], Saint [[Hedwig of Andechs]]. 
It was the first Catholic church built in [[Prussia]] after [[the Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hedwigs-kathedrale.de/en/hedwigs-kathedrale/st-hedwig-s-cathedral|title=St Hedwig’s Cathedral {{!}} St. Hedwigs-Kathedrale Berlin|website=hedwigs-kathedrale.de|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was designed by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]]&lt;ref name=history /&gt; and modelled after the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon in Rome]]. 
Construction started in 1747, but was interrupted and delayed several times by economic problems. It was not opened until 1 November 1773, when the king's friend, [[Ignacy Krasicki]], the [[Bishop of Warmia]] (later [[Archbishop of Gniezno]]), officiated at the cathedral's consecration {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

After the [[Kristallnacht]] pogroms that took place on the night of 9–10 November 1938, [[Bernhard Lichtenberg]], a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[cathedral chapter]] of St. Hedwig since 1931, prayed publicly for Jews at evening prayer. Lichtenberg was later jailed by the Nazis and died on the way to the [[concentration camp]] at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]].&lt;ref&gt;Yad Vashem website (2016). ''Bernhard Lichtenberg - the righteous among the nations''. Available at: http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/lichtenberg.asp (Accessed: 19 October 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1965, Blessed Bernhard Lichtenberg's remains were transferred to the [[crypt]] at St. Hedwig's Cathedral.

The cathedral was severely damaged by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Allied bombing]] in an air raid on 1 March 1943. Only the damaged shell of the building was left standing. Reconstruction started in 1952 and on 1 November 1963, All Saints' Day, the new high altar was consecrated by the Bishop of Berlin, Alfred Cardinal Bengsch.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Hedwigs Kathedrale Berlin: Destruction and reconstruction''.

Between 1949 and 1990, St. Hedwig's was in [[East Berlin]], under the control of the [[East Germany|East German]] government.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The cathedral closed for major renovations on 1 September 2018.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} The relics of Bl. Bernhard Lichtenberg have been transferred to the crypt of [[Maria Regina Martyrum]] during the time of the Cathedral's renovation.

== Tapestries ==

Three impressive [[tapestry|tapestries]] are now used in the reconstructed cathedral. All three share the motif of the heavenly Jerusalem but only one is set up and viewable at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;''St.Hedwigs Kathedrale Berlin : Interior''.

The tapestry of former [[Bauhaus]] student [[Margaretha Reichardt]] (Grete Reichardt) (1907 - 1984) of [[Erfurt]] was handwoven in 1963.  It depicts a stylised city with the names of the apostles inscribed on foundation stones. God is represented by the [[Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of Life]] and a lamb features as a symbol of Christ.

{{illm|Anton Wendling|de}} (1891 - 1965) made a colorful [[appliqué]] work. It is a geometric composition using themes from the [[Book of Revelation]].

The three-part woven carpet made by {{illm|Else Bechteler-Moses|de}} (1933 - ) was made in cooperation with Nürnberger Gobelinmanufaktur GmbH, a tapestry weaving company, between 1979 and 1981. This also uses themes from Revelations.

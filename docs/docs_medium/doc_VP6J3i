===Quartz viscometer===
The quartz viscometer is a special type of vibrational viscometer. Here, an oscillating quartz crystal is immersed into a fluid and the specific influence on the oscillating behavior defines the viscosity. The principle of quartz viscosimetry is based on the idea of W.&amp;nbsp;P. Mason. The basic concept is the application of a piezoelectric crystal for the determination of viscosity. The high-frequent electrical field that is applied to the oscillator causes a movement of the sensor and results in the shearing of the fluid. The movement of the sensor is then influenced by the external forces (the shear stress) of the fluid, which affects the electrical response of the sensor.&lt;ref&gt;W. P. Mason, M. Hill: ''Measurement of the viscosity and shear elasticity of liquids by means of a torsionally vibrating crystal''; Transactions of the ASME. In: Journal of Lubricating Technology. Band 69, 1947, S. 359–370.&lt;/ref&gt; The calibration procedure as a pre-condition of viscosity determination by means of a quartz crystal goes back to B. Bode, who facilitated the detailed analysis of the electrical and mechanical transmission behavior of the oscillating system.&lt;ref&gt;Berthold Bode: ''Entwicklung eines Quarzviskosimeters für Messungen bei hohen Drücken''. Dissertation der TU Clausthal, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of this calibration, the quartz viscosimeter was developed which allows continuous viscosity determination in resting and flowing liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flucon.de/produkte/quartz-viscosimeter-qvis/?lang=en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702224834/http://flucon.de/produkte/quartz-viscosimeter-qvis/?lang=en |archivedate=2015-07-02 }}&lt;|accessdate=2015-07-02 |&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Quartz Crystal Microbalance ====
The [[quartz crystal microbalance]] functions as a vibrational viscometer by the piezoelectric properties inherent in quartz to perform measurements of conductance spectra of liquids and thin films exposed to the surface of the crystal.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johannsmann|first=Diethelm|date=2008|title=Viscoelastic, mechanical, and dielectric measurements on complex samples with the quartz crystal microbalance|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|language=en|volume=10|issue=31|pages=4516–34|doi=10.1039/b803960g|pmid=18665301|bibcode=2008PCCP...10.4516J|issn=1463-9076}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these spectra, frequency shifts and a broadening of the peaks for the resonant and overtone frequencies of the quartz crystal are tracked and used to determine changes in mass as well as the [[viscosity]], [[shear modulus]], and other viscoelastic properties of the liquid or thin film. One benefit of using the quartz crystal microbalance to measure viscosity is the small amount of sample required for obtaining an accurate measurement. However, due to the dependence viscoelastic properties on the sample preparation techniques and thickness of the film or bulk liquid, there can be errors up to 10% in measurements in viscosity between samples.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

An interesting technique to measure the viscosity of a liquid using a quartz crystal microbalance which improves the consistency of measurements uses a drop method.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bai|first=Qingsong|last2=Hu|first2=Jianguo|last3=Huang|first3=Xianhe|last4=Huang|first4=Hongyuan|date=2016|title=Using QCM for field measurement of liquid viscosities in a novel mass-sensitivity-base method|journal=2016 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium (IFCS)|location=New Orleans, LA, USA|publisher=IEEE|volume=|pages=1–3|doi=10.1109/FCS.2016.7546819|isbn=9781509020911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ash|first=Dean C.|last2=Joyce|first2=Malcolm J.|last3=Barnes|first3=Chris|last4=Booth|first4=C.

The viscosity is extracted from the shift in the frequency data using the following equation 

&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = -f_0^{3/2}\sqrt{\frac{\eta_l \rho_l}{\pi \mu_Q \rho_Q}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; is the resonant frequency, &lt;math&gt;\rho_l&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluid, &lt;math&gt;\mu_Q&lt;/math&gt; is the shear modulus of the quartz, and &lt;math&gt;\rho_Q&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the quartz.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; An extension of this technique corrects the shift in the resonant frequency by the size of the drop deposited on the quartz crystal.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Rotational viscometers==
Rotational viscometers use the idea that the torque required to turn an object in a fluid is a function of the viscosity of that fluid. They measure the torque required to rotate a disk or bob in a fluid at a known speed.

&quot;Cup and bob&quot; viscometers work by defining the exact volume of a sample to be sheared within a test cell; the torque required to achieve a certain rotational speed is measured and plotted. There are two classical geometries in &quot;cup and bob&quot; viscometers, known as either the &quot;Couette&quot; or &quot;Searle&quot; systems, distinguished by whether the cup or bob rotates. The rotating cup is preferred in some cases because it reduces the onset of [[Taylor vortex|Taylor vortices]] at very high shear rates, but the rotating bob is more commonly used, as the instrument design can be more flexible for other geometries as well.

&quot;Cone and plate&quot; viscometers use a narrow-angled cone in close proximity to a flat plate. With this system, the shear rate between the geometries is constant at any given rotational speed.  The viscosity can easily be calculated from shear stress (from the torque) and shear rate (from the angular velocity).

If a test with any geometries runs through a table of several shear rates or stresses, the data can be used to plot a flow curve, that is a graph of viscosity vs shear rate. If the above test is carried out slowly enough for the measured value (shear stress if rate is being controlled, or conversely) to reach a steady value at each step, the data is said to be at &quot;equilibrium&quot;, and the graph is then an &quot;equilibrium flow curve&quot;. This is preferable over non-equilibrium measurements, as the data can usually be replicated across multiple other instruments or with other geometries.

===Calculation of shear rate and shear stress form factors===
Rheometers and viscometers work with torque and angular velocity. Since viscosity is normally considered in terms of shear stress and shear rates, a method is needed to convert from &quot;instrument numbers&quot; to &quot;rheology numbers&quot;. Each measuring system used in an instrument has its associated &quot;form factors&quot; to convert torque to shear stress and to convert angular velocity to shear rate.

We will call the shear stress form factor {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the shear rate factor {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

: shear stress = torque ÷ {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
: shear rate = {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} × angular velocity.
:: For some measuring systems such as parallel plates, the user can set the gap between the measuring systems. In this case the equation used is
::: shear rate = {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} × angular velocity / gap.
: viscosity = shear stress / shear rate.

The following sections show how the form factors are calculated for each measuring system.

====Cone and plate====
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  C_1 &amp;= \frac{3}{2} r^3, \\
  C_2 &amp;= \frac{1}{\theta},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: {{mvar|r}} is the radius of the cone,
: {{mvar|θ}} is the cone angle in radians.

====Parallel plates====
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  C_1 &amp;= \frac{3}{2} r^3, \\
  C_2 &amp;= \frac{3}{4} r,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|r}} is the radius of the cone.

'''Note:''' The shear stress varies across the radius for a parallel plate.  The above formula refers to the 3/4 radius position if the test sample is Newtonian.
 
====Coaxial cylinders====
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  C_1 &amp;= \frac{1}{3} r_\text{a}^2 H, \\
  C_2 &amp;= \frac{2 r_\text{i}^2 r_\text{o}^2}{r_\text{a}^2 \left( r_\text{o}^2 - r_\text{i}^2\right)},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (''r''{{sub|i}} + ''r''{{sub|o}})/2}} is the average radius,
: {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the inner radius,
: {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the outer radius,
: {{mvar|H}} is the height of cylinder.

Note: {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} takes the shear stress as that occurring at an average radius {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

===Electromagnetically spinning-sphere viscometer (EMS viscometer)===
[[File:EMS viscometer measuring principle.png|thumb|Measuring principle of the electromagnetically spinning-sphere viscometer]]

The EMS viscometer measures the viscosity of liquids through observation of the rotation of a sphere driven by electromagnetic interaction: Two magnets attached to a rotor create a rotating magnetic field. The sample ③ to be measured is in a small test tube ②. Inside the tube is an aluminium sphere ④. The tube is located in a temperature-controlled chamber ① and set such that the sphere is situated in the centre of the two magnets.

The rotating magnetic field induces eddy currents in the sphere. The resulting Lorentz interaction between the magnetic field and these eddy currents generate torque that rotates the sphere. The rotational speed of the sphere depends on the rotational velocity of the magnetic field, the magnitude of the magnetic field and the viscosity of the sample around the sphere. The motion of the sphere is monitored by a video camera ⑤ located below the cell. The torque applied to the sphere is proportional to the difference in the angular velocity of the magnetic field {{math|''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the one of the sphere {{math|''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;}}. There is thus a linear relationship between {{math|(''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; − ''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;)/''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the viscosity of the liquid.

This new measuring principle was developed by Sakai et al. at the University of Tokyo. The EMS viscometer distinguishes itself from other rotational viscometers by three main characteristics: 
* All parts of the viscometer that come in direct contact with the sample are disposable and inexpensive.
* The measurements are performed in a sealed sample vessel.
* The EMS viscometer requires only very small sample quantities (0.3&amp;nbsp;mL).

===Stabinger viscometer===
By modifying the classic Couette-type rotational viscometer, it is possible to combine the accuracy of kinematic viscosity determination with a wide measuring range.

The outer cylinder of the Stabinger viscometer is a sample-filled tube that rotates at constant speed in a temperature-controlled copper housing. The hollow internal cylinder – shaped as a conical rotor – is centered within the sample by hydrodynamic lubrication&lt;ref&gt;Beitz, W. and Küttner, K.-H., English edition by Davies, B. J., translation by Shields, M. J. (1994). Dubbel Handbook of Mechanical Engineering. London: Springer-Verlag Ltd., p. F89.&lt;/ref&gt; effects and [[centrifugal force]]s. In this way all bearing [[friction]], an inevitable factor in most rotational devices, is fully avoided. The rotating fluid's shear forces drive the rotor, while a magnet inside the rotor forms an [[eddy current brake]] with the surrounding copper housing. An equilibrium rotor speed is established between driving and retarding forces, which is an unambiguous measure of the dynamic viscosity. The [[speed]] and [[torque]] measurement is implemented without direct contact by a [[Hall-effect]] sensor counting the frequency of the rotating [[magnetic field]]. This allows a highly precise [[torque]] resolution of 50&amp;nbsp;[[newton metre|pN·m]] and a wide measuring range from 0.2 to 30,000&amp;nbsp;mPa·s with a single measuring system. A built-in [[density]] measurement based on the [[oscillating U-tube]] principle allows the determination of kinematic [[viscosity]] from the measured dynamic viscosity employing the relation
: &lt;math&gt;\nu = \frac{\eta}{\rho},&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: {{mvar|ν}} is the kinematic viscosity (mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s),
: {{mvar|η}} is the dynamic viscosity (mPa·s),
: {{mvar|ρ}} is the density (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Bubble viscometer==
Bubble viscometers are used to quickly determine kinematic viscosity of known liquids such as resins and varnishes. The time required for an air bubble to rise is directly proportional to the viscosity of the liquid, so the faster the bubble rises, the lower the viscosity. The alphabetical-comparison method uses 4 sets of lettered reference tubes, A5 through Z10, of known viscosity to cover a viscosity range from 0.005 to 1,000 [[Viscosity#Kinematic viscosity|stokes]]. The direct-time method uses a single 3-line times tube for determining the &quot;bubble seconds&quot;, which may then be converted to stokes.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;ASTM Paint and Coatings Manual 0-8031-2060-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This method is considerably accurate, but the measurements can vary due to variances in buoyancy because of the changing in shape of the bubble in the tube.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; However, this does not cause any sort of serious miscalculation.

==Rectangular-slit viscometer==
The basic design of a rectangular-slit viscometer/rheometer consists of a rectangular-slit channel with uniform cross-sectional area. A test liquid is pumped at a constant flow rate through this channel. Multiple pressure sensors flush-mounted at linear distances along the stream-wise direction measure pressure drop as depicted in the figure:

[[File:Rectangular slit.png|center|Rectangular Slit Viscometer/Rheometer]]

'''Measuring principle:''' The slit viscometer/rheometer is based on the fundamental principle that a viscous liquid resists flow, exhibiting a decreasing pressure along the length of the slit. The pressure decrease or drop ({{math|∆''P''}}) is correlated with the shear stress at the wall boundary. The apparent shear rate is directly related to the flow rate and the dimension of the slit. The apparent shear rate, the shear stress, and the [[apparent viscosity]] are calculated:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \dot{\gamma}_\text{a} &amp;= \frac{6Q}{wh^2}, \\
                 \sigma &amp;= \frac{wh}{2(w + h)} \frac{\Delta P}{l}, \\
          \eta_\text{a} &amp;= \frac{\sigma}{\dot{\gamma}_\text{a}},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is the apparent shear rate (s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;),
: {{mvar|σ}} is the shear stress (Pa),
: {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the apparent viscosity (Pa·s),
: {{math|∆''P''}} is the pressure difference between the leading pressure sensor and the last pressure sensor (Pa),
: {{mvar|Q}} is the flow rate (ml/s),
: {{mvar|w}} is the width of the flow channel (mm),
: {{mvar|h}} is the depth of the flow channel (mm),
: {{mvar|l}} is the distance between the leading pressure sensor and the last pressure sensor (mm).

To determine the viscosity of a liquid, the liquid sample is pumped through the slit channel at a constant flow rate, and the pressure drop is measured. Following these equations, the apparent viscosity is calculated for the apparent shear rate. For a Newtonian liquid, the apparent viscosity is the same as the true viscosity, and the single shear-rate measurement is sufficient. For non-Newtonian liquids, the apparent viscosity is not true viscosity. In order to obtain true viscosity, the apparent viscosities are measured at multiple apparent shear rates. Then true viscosities {{mvar|η}} at various shear rates are calculated using Weissenberg–Rabinowitsch–Mooney correction factor:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\eta} = \frac{1}{2\eta_\text{a}}\left(2 + \frac{\mathrm{d} \ln{\dot{\gamma}_\text{a}} }{\mathrm{d} \ln{\sigma}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The calculated true viscosity is the same as the cone and plate values at the same shear rate.

A modified version of the rectangular-slit viscometer/rheometer can also be used to determine apparent [[extensional viscosity]].

==Krebs Viscometer==
The Krebs Viscometer uses a digital graph and a small sidearm spindle to measure the viscosity of a fluid. It is mostly used in the paint industry.

==Miscellaneous viscometer types==
Other viscometer types use balls or other objects. Viscometers that can characterize [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s are usually called ''[[rheometer]]s'' or ''[[plastometer]]s''.

In the I.C.I &quot;Oscar&quot; viscometer, a sealed can of fluid was oscillated torsionally, and by clever measurement techniques it was possible to measure both viscosity and elasticity in the sample.

The [[Marsh funnel]] viscometer measures viscosity from the time (''efflux time'') it takes a known volume of liquid to flow from the base of a cone through a short tube. This is similar in principle to the [[flow cups]] (efflux cups) like the [[Ford viscosity cup|Ford]], [[Zahn cup|Zahn]] and [[Shell cup|Shell]] cups which use different shapes to the cone and various nozzle sizes. The measurements can be done according to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 2431, [[ASTM]] D1200 - 10 or [[DIN]] 53411.

The [http://www.google.com/patents/WO2013001538A1?cl=en flexible-blade rheometer] improves the accuracy of measurements for the lower-viscosity liquids utilizing the subtle changes in the flow field due to the flexibility of the moving or stationary blade (sometimes called wing or single-side-clamped cantilever).

Despite being newly married to a man called Grady, Shug instigates a sexual relationship with Celie on her next visit. One night Shug asks Celie about her sister, and Shug helps Celie recover letters from Nettie that Mister has been hiding from her for decades. The letters indicate that Nettie befriended a missionary couple, Samuel and Corrine, the well-dressed woman that Celie saw in the store, whom Nettie eventually accompanied to Africa to do missionary work. Samuel and Corrine have unwittingly adopted both Adam and Olivia. Corrine, noticing that her adopted children resemble Nettie, wonders if Samuel fathered the children with her. Increasingly suspicious, Corrine tries to limit Nettie's role in her family.

Through her letters, Nettie reveals that she has become disillusioned with her missionary work. Corrine becomes ill with a fever. Nettie asks Samuel to tell her how he adopted Olivia and Adam. Realizing that Adam and Olivia are Celie's children, Nettie then learns that Alphonso is actually her and Celie's stepfather. Their biological father was a store owner whom white men lynched because they resented his success. She also learns that their mother suffered a mental collapse after the death of her husband and that Alphonso exploited the situation in order to control their mother's considerable wealth.

Nettie confesses to Samuel and Corrine that she is in fact the children's biological aunt. The gravely ill Corrine refuses to believe her until Nettie reminds her of her previous encounter with Celie in the store. Later, Corrine dies, finally having accepted Nettie's story. Meanwhile, Celie visits Alphonso, who confirms Nettie's story. Celie begins to lose some of her faith in God, which she confides to Shug, who explains to Celie her own unique religious philosophy. Shug helped Celie to realize that God is not someone who has power over her like the rest of the men in Celie's life. Rather, God was an “It” and not a “Who”.

Celie, having had enough of her husband's abuse, decides to leave Mister along with Shug and Squeak, who is considering a singing career of her own. Celie puts a curse on Mister before leaving him for good. Celie settles in Tennessee and supports herself as a seamstress.  

Alphonso dies, Celie inherits his land, and moves back into her childhood home. Around this time, Shug falls in love with Germaine, a member of her band, and this news crushes Celie. Shug travels with Germaine, all the while writing postcards to Celie. Celie pledges to love Shug even if Shug does not love her back.

Celie learns that Mister, suffering from a considerable decline in fortunes after Celie left him, has changed dramatically and Celie begins to call him by his first name, Albert. Albert proposes that they marry &quot;in the spirit as well as in the flesh,&quot; but Celie declines.

Meanwhile, Nettie and Samuel marry and prepare to return to America. Before they leave, Adam marries Tashi, an African girl. Following an African tradition, Tashi undergoes the painful rituals of female circumcision and facial scarring. In solidarity, Adam undergoes the same facial scarring ritual.

As Celie realizes that she is content in her life without Shug, Shug returns, having ended her relationship with Germaine. Nettie, Samuel, Olivia, Adam, and Tashi all arrive at Celie's house. Nettie and Celie reunite after 30 years, and introduce one another to their respective families as the novel ends.

==Adaptations==
{{Main|The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple (musical)}}
The novel was adapted into a [[The Color Purple (film)|film of the same name]] in 1985. It was directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and stars [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Celie, [[Danny Glover]] as Albert, and [[Oprah Winfrey]] as Sofia. Though nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]], it won none. This perceived snubbing ignited controversy because many critics considered it the best picture that year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/color_purple Rotten Tomatoes page for ''The Color Purple'']&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Roger Ebert]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-color-purple-1985 Roger Ebert's review of ''The Color Purple'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 2005, a [[The Color Purple (musical)|musical adaptation]] of the novel and film with lyrics and music by [[Stephen Bray]], [[Brenda Russell]] and [[Allee Willis]], and book by [[Marsha Norman]] opened at [[The Broadway Theatre]] in New York City. The show was produced by [[Scott Sanders (producer)|Scott Sanders]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Harvey Weinstein]], and [[Oprah Winfrey]], who was also an investor.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPT&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=John Fleming|title=Passion for ‘Purple' has Local Roots|publisher=&quot;[[Saint Petersburg Times]]&quot;|url= http://www.sptimes.com/2005/12/01/news_pf/Floridian/Passion_for__Purple__.shtml}} Dec. 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast a radio adaptation of the novel in ten 15-minute episodes as a ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' serial, with [[Nadine Marshall]] as Celie, [[Nikki Amuka-Bird]], [[Nina Sosanya]] and [[Eamonn Walker]]. The script was by [[Patricia Cumper]], and in 2009 the production received the [[Sony Radio Academy Awards]] Silver Drama Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioawards.org/winners/?awid=157&amp;awname=The+Drama+Award&amp;year=2009 Sony Radio Academy Awards 2009: Dramas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boycotting Israel==
As part of the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement (BDS), the author declined publication of the book in Israel&lt;ref name=&quot;letter&quot;&gt;[http://pacbi.org/etemplate.php?id=1917 Letter] from [[Alice Walker]] to Publishers at [[Yediot Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012.

The '''Chaetognatha''' {{IPAc-en|k|iː|'|t|ɒ|g|n|@|θ|@}} or '''chaetognaths''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|iː|t|ɒ|g|n|æ|θ|s}} (meaning ''bristle-jaws'') are a phylum of predatory [[marine worm]]s that are a major component of [[plankton]] worldwide. Commonly known as '''arrow worms''', about 20% of the known Chaetognatha species are [[benthic zone|benthic]], and can attach to algae and rocks. They are found in all marine waters, from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from {{convert|2|to|120|mm|in|1}}.

There are more than 120 modern species assigned to over 20 genera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Register of Marine Species|url=http://www.marinespecies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the limited diversity of species, the number of individuals is large.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bone&quot;&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Bone Q, Kapp H, Pierrot-Bults AC |year=1991 |title=The Biology of Chaetognaths |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |place=London |isbn=978-0-19-857715-7 |ref=Bone, Kapp &amp; Pierrot-Bults}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrow worms are usually considered a type of [[protostome]] that do not belong to either [[Ecdysozoa]] or [[Lophotrochozoa]].

==Anatomy==
[[File:MEB back.png|thumb|left|180px|The jaw organ of a Chaetognath of the genus ''[[Sagitta (genus)|Sagitta]]'']]
Chaetognaths are transparent or translucent dart-shaped animals covered by a [[cuticle]]. The body is divided into a distinct head, trunk, and tail. There are between four and fourteen hooked, grasping spines on each side of their head, flanking a hollow vestibule containing the mouth. The spines are used in hunting, and covered with a flexible hood arising from the neck region when the animal is swimming. All chaetognaths are [[carnivore|carnivorous]], preying on other planktonic animals.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 1046–1050|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species are also reported to be omnivores, feeding on algae and detritus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Grigor|first1=Jordan J.|last2=Schmid|first2=Moritz S.|last3=Caouette|first3=Marianne|last4=St.-Onge|first4=Vicky|last5=Brown|first5=Thomas A.|last6=Barthélémy|first6=Roxane-M.|date=2020-07-01|title=Non-carnivorous feeding in Arctic chaetognaths|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661120301270|journal=Progress in Oceanography|language=en|volume=186|pages=102388|doi=10.1016/j.pocean.2020.102388|issn=0079-6611}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''.'''

The trunk bears one or two pairs of lateral fins incorporating structures superficially similar to the [[fin ray]]s of fish, with which they are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]], however: unlike those of vertebrates, these are composed of a thickened [[basement membrane]] extending from the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]]. An additional caudal fin covers the post-anal tail.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; Two chaetognath species, ''[[Caecosagitta macrocephala]]'' and ''[[Eukrohnia fowleri]]'', have [[bioluminescent]] organs on their fins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haddock SH, Case JF |date=20 January 1994 |title=A bioluminescent chaetognath |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=367 |issue=6460 |pages=225–226 |doi=10.1038/367225a0|bibcode=1994Natur.367..225H |s2cid=4362422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thuesen EV, Goetz FE, Haddock SH | title = Bioluminescent organs of two deep-sea arrow worms, Eukrohnia fowleri and Caecosagitta macrocephala, with further observations on Bioluminescence in chaetognaths | journal = The Biological Bulletin | volume = 219 | issue = 2 | pages = 100–11 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20972255 | doi = 10.1086/BBLv219n2p100  | author3link = Steven Haddock }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaetognaths swim in short bursts using a dorso-ventral undulating body motion, where their tail fin assists with propulsion and the body fins with stabilization and steering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordan CE |year=1992 |title=A model of rapid-start swimming at intermediate Reynolds number: undulatory locomotion in the chaetognath ''Sagitta elegans'' |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=119–137 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/163/1/119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species are known to use the [[neurotoxin]] [[tetrodotoxin]] to subdue prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = | chapter = The Tetrodotoxin Venom of Chaetognaths | pages = 55–60 | veditors = Bone Q, Kapp H, Pierrot-Bults AC |title=The Biology of chaetognaths |date=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-857715-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body cavity is lined by [[peritoneum]], and therefore represents a true [[coelom]], and is divided into one compartment on each side of the trunk, and additional compartments inside the head and tail, all separated completely by septa.  Although they have a mouth with one or two rows of tiny teeth, compound eyes, and a nervous system, they have no respiratory or circulatory systems.

The mouth opens into a muscular [[pharynx]], which contains glands to lubricate the passage of food. From here, a straight intestine runs the length of the trunk to an [[anus]] just forward of the tail. The intestine is the primary site of digestion and includes a pair of [[diverticulum|diverticula]] near the anterior end.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; Materials are moved about the body cavity by [[cilia]]. Waste materials are simply excreted through the skin and anus. Eukrohniid species possess an oil vacuole closely associated with the gut.

The nervous system is reasonably simple, consisting of a [[ganglion]]ated nerve ring surrounding the pharynx. The dorsal ganglion is the largest, but nerves extend from all the ganglia along the length of the body. Chaetognaths have two compound eyes, each consisting of a number of pigment-cup [[ocelli]] fused together. In addition, there are a number of sensory bristles arranged in rows along the side of the body, where they probably perform a function similar to that of the [[lateral line]] in fish. An additional, curved, band of sensory bristles lies over the head and neck.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The arrow worm [[rhabdomere]]s are derived from [[microtubule]]s 20&amp;nbsp;nm long and 50&amp;nbsp;nm wide, which in turn form conical bodies that contain granules and thread structures. The cone body is derived from a [[cilium]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Photoreception&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica from [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] . 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
All species are [[hermaphroditic]], carrying both [[ovum|eggs]] and [[spermatozoon|sperm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bone&quot; /&gt; Each animal possesses a pair of [[testis|testes]] within the tail, and a pair of [[ovary|ovaries]] in the posterior region of the main body cavity. Immature sperm are released from the testes to mature inside the cavity of the tail, and then swim through a short duct to a [[seminal vesicle]] where they are packaged into a [[spermatophore]].&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;(Sexually and Asexually)

During mating, each individual places a spermatophore onto the neck of its partner after rupture of the seminal vesicle. The sperm rapidly escape from the spermatophore and swim along the midline of the animal until they reach a pair of small pores just in front of the tail. These pores connect to the [[oviduct]]s, into which the developed eggs have already passed from the ovaries, and it is here that fertilisation takes place.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The eggs are planktonic, develop in marsupial sacs or attached to [[alga]]e, and hatch into miniature versions of the adult, without a well-defined [[larva]]l stage.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Terazaki|first1=M.|last2=Miller|first2=C.

== Classification ==
Chaetognaths are traditionally classed as [[deuterostomes]] by [[embryologist]]s. [[Lynn Margulis]] and K. V.

== Fossil record ==
Due to their soft bodies, chaetognaths fossilize poorly. Even so, several fossil chaetognath species have been described.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vannier2007&quot; /&gt; Chaetognaths appear to have originated in the [[Cambrian]] Period. Complete body fossils have been formally described from the Lower [[Cambrian]] [[Maotianshan shales]] of [[Yunnan, China]] (''Eognathacantha ercainella'' Chen &amp; Huang&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen JY, Huang DY | title = A possible Lower Cambrian chaetognath (arrow worm) | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5591 | pages = 187 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12364798 | doi = 10.1126/science.1075059 | s2cid = 544495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Protosagitta spinosa'' Hu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu SX |year=2005 |title=Taphonomy and palaeoecology of the Early Cambrian Chengjiang Biota from Eastern Yunnan, China |journal=Berliner Paläobiologische Abhandlungen |volume=7 |issue= |pages=1–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the Middle Cambrian [[Burgess Shale]] of British Columbia (''[[Oesia|Oesia disjuncta]]'' Walcott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szaniawski H |year=2005 |title=Cambrian chaetognaths recognized in Burgess Shale fossils |journal=[[Acta Palaeontologica Polonica]] |volume=50 |issue =1 |pages=1–8 |url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app50/app50-001.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;), a view challenged by Conway Morris (2009). A more recent chaetognath, ''Paucijaculum samamithion'' Schram, has been described from the Mazon Creek biota from the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] of Illinois. Chaetognaths were thought possibly to be related to some of the animals grouped with the [[conodont]]s. The conodonts themselves, however, are thought to be related to the [[vertebrates]]. It is now thought that [[protoconodont]] elements (e.g., ''[[Protohertzina]] anabarica'' Missarzhevsky, 1973), are probably grasping spines of chaetognaths rather than teeth of conodonts. Previously chaetognaths in the Early Cambrian were only suspected from these protoconodont elements, but the more recent discoveries of body fossils have confirmed their presence then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szaniawski H |year=2002 |title=New evidence for the protoconodont origin of chaetognaths |journal=[[Acta Palaeontologica Polonica]] |volume=47 |issue=3 |url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app47/app47-405.pdf | pages=405–419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infection by giant viruses ==

In 2018, reanalysis of electron microscopy photographs from the 1980s allowed scientists to identify a [[giant virus]] (''Meelsvirus'') infecting ''Adhesisagitta hispida''; its site of multiplication is nuclear and the virions (length: 1.25 μm) are enveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shinn GL, Bullard BL | title = Ultrastructure of Meelsvirus: A nuclear virus of arrow worms (phylum Chaetognatha) producing giant &quot;tailed&quot; virions | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 13 | issue = 9 | pages = e0203282 | date = 2018-09-19 | pmid = 30231047 | pmc = 6145532 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0203282 | editor-first = Carmen | editor-last = San Martin | bibcode = 2018PLoSO..1303282S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, reanalysis of other previous studies has shown that structures that were taken in 1967 for bristles present on the surface of the species ''[[Spadellidae|Spadella]] cephaloptera'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Horridge GA, Boulton PS |date=1967-11-14|title=Prey detection by Chaetognatha via a vibration sense|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Casanova who devoted a large part of his scientific life to the study of chaetognaths). The other species has been named ''Megaklothovirus horridgei'' (in tribute to the first author of the 1967 article). On a photograph, one of the viruses ''M. horridgei'', although truncated, is 3.9 μm long, corresponding to about twice the length of the bacteria [[Escherichia coli]]. Many [[Ribosome|ribosomes]] are present in virions but their origin remains unknown (cellular, viral or only partly viral). To date, giant viruses known to infect [[metazoans]] are exceptionally rare.

Any [[worm]] that lives in a [[ocean|marine]] [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] is considered a '''marine worm'''.  Marine worms are found in several different [[phylum (biology)|phyla]], including the [[Platyhelminthes]], [[Nematoda]], [[Annelida]] (segmented worms), [[Chaetognatha]], [[Hemichordata]], and [[Phoronida]]. For a list of marine animals that have been called &quot;sea worms&quot;, see [[Sea worm (disambiguation)|sea worm]].

Many of these worms have specialized tentacles used for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide and also may be used for reproduction.

Some marine worms are [[tube worm (body plan)|tube worm]]s, of which the [[giant tube worm]] lives in waters near underwater [[volcanoes]], and can withstand temperatures up to 90 degrees [[Celsius]] or about 194 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Some worms can live in the trench. These worms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/10/1028_021028_TVtubeworm.html|title=Giant Tubeworms Probed for Clues to Survival|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; were first discovered in the Pacific Ocean off the [[Galápagos Islands]].

In recent years, marine worms (especially those found in the ocean) have been observed ingesting microplastic particles found in the oceans. This trend is concerning many scientists, as marine worms act as an important food source for many fish and wading birds. Marine Worms play as [[Keystone Species]] in an ecosystem, and the introduction of plastic in the oceans will not only diminish the growth rates of the marine worms, but also affect the food chain of that ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;https://aslo.org/page/limnology-&amp;-oceanography&lt;/ref&gt;

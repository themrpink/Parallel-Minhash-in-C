&quot;Altman was a genuine movie maverick,&quot; states author [[Ian Freer]], because he went against the commercial conformity of the movie industry: &quot;He was the scourge of the film establishment, and his work generally cast an astute, scathing eye over the breadth of American culture, often exploding genres and character archetypes; Altman was fascinated by people with imperfections, people as they really are, not as the movies would have you believe.&quot;&lt;ref name=Freer&gt;{{cite book |author=Freer, Ian |title=Moviemakers |publisher=Quercus |place=London, UK |year=2009 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Alan Rudolph]], during a special tribute to Altman, refers to his moviemaking style as &quot;Altmanesque.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-07&gt;{{cite news |author=Carr, David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/movies/21altman.html?_r=0 |title=A very Altmanesque tribute to Altman |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his independent style of directing, he developed a bad reputation among screenwriters and those on the business side of films. He admits, &quot;I have a bad reputation with writers, developed over the years: 'Oh, he doesn't do what you write, blah blah blah.' ... [[Ring Lardner, Jr.|Ring Lardner]] was very pissed off with me,&quot; for not following his script.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;{{rp|page=18}} Nor did Altman get along well with studio heads, once punching an executive in the nose and knocking him into a swimming pool because he insisted he cut six minutes from a film he was working on.&lt;ref name=Armstrong/&gt;{{rp|page=9}}

His reputation among actors is quite different, however. With them, his independence sometimes extended to his choice of actors, often going against consensus. [[Cher]], for instance, credits him for launching her career with both the stage play and film, ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'' (1982). &quot;Without Bob I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me. Everyone. ... Nobody would give me a break. I am convinced that Bob was the only one who was brave enough to do it.&quot; Others, like [[Julianne Moore]], describes working with him:

{{quote|You know, all this talk about Bob being this kind of irascible, difficult kind of person? Well, he was never that way with an actor or with a creative person that I saw. Never, never, never. He saved all that for the money people.&lt;ref name=Zuckoff/&gt;{{rp|page=431}}}}

However, director [[Robert Dornhelm]] states, Altman &quot;looked at film as a pure, artistic venue.&quot; With ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993), for instance, the distributor &quot;begged him&quot; to cut a few minutes from the length, to keep it commercially viable: &quot;Bob just thought the Antichrist was trying to destroy his art. They were well-meaning people who wanted him to get what he deserved, which was a big commercial hit. But when it came down to the art or the money, he was with the art.&quot;&lt;ref name=Zuckoff /&gt;{{rp|page=438}}

[[Sally Kellerman]], noting Altman's willful attitude, still looks back with regret at giving up a chance to act in one of his films:

{{quote|I had just finished filming ''[[Last of the Red Hot Lovers]]'' when Bob called me one day at home. &quot;Sally, do you want to be in my picture after next?&quot; he asked. &quot;Only if it's a good part,&quot; I said. He hung up on me.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Bob was as stubborn and arrogant as I was at the time, but the sad thing is that I cheated myself out of working with someone I loved so much, someone who made acting both fun and easy and who trusted his actors. Bob loved actors. Stars would line up to work for nothing for Bob Altman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kellerman, Sally |title=Read My Lips: Stories of a Hollywood life |publisher=Weinstein Books |year=2013 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Themes and subjects ===
Unlike directors whose work fits within various [[film genre]]s, such as Westerns, musicals, war films, or comedies, Altman's work has been defined as more &quot;anti-genre&quot; by various critics.&lt;ref name=Hillstrom/&gt; This is partly due to the satirical and comedy nature of many of his films. [[Geraldine Chaplin]], daughter of [[Charlie Chaplin]], compared the humor in his films to her father's films:

{{quote|They're funny in the right way. Funny in a critical way — of what the world is and the world we live in. They were both geniuses in their way. They alter your experience of reality. They have their world and they have their humor. That humor is so rare.&lt;ref name=Zuckoff /&gt;{{rp|page=287}} }}

Altman made it clear that he did not like &quot;storytelling&quot; in his films, contrary to the way most television and mainstream movies are made. According to Altman biographer [[Mitchell Zuckoff]], &quot;he disliked the word 'story,' believing that a plot should be secondary to an exploration of pure (or, even better, impure) human behavior.&quot;&lt;ref name=Zuckoff&gt;{{cite book |author=Zuckoff, Mitchell |title=Robert Altman: The oral biography |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |place=New York, NY |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-307-26768-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=xiii}} Zuckoff describes the purposes underlying many of Altman's films: &quot;He loved the chaotic nature of real life, with conflicting perspectives, surprising twists, unexplained actions, and ambiguous endings. He especially loved many voices, sometimes arguing, sometimes agreeing, ideally overlapping, a cocktail party or a street scene captured as he experienced it.&lt;ref name=Zuckoff/&gt;{{rp|page=xiii}} [[Julianne Moore]], after seeing some of his movies, credits Altman's style of directing for her decision to become a film actress, rather than a stage actress:

{{quote|I felt it really strongly. And I thought, &quot;I don't know who this guy is, but that's what I want to do. I want to do that kind of work.&quot; From then on I'd see his films whenever I could, and he was always my absolute favorite director, for what he said thematically and emotionally and how he felt about people.&lt;ref name=Zuckoff/&gt;{{rp|page=324}}}}

Film author Charles Derry writes that Altman's films &quot;characteristically contain perceptive observations, telling exchanges, and moments of crystal clear revelation of human folly.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hillstrom/&gt; Because Altman was an astute observer of society and &quot;especially interested in people,&quot; notes Derry, many of his film characters had &quot;that sloppy imperfection associated with human beings as they are, with life as it is lived.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hillstrom /&gt; As a result, his films are often an indirect critique of American society.

For many of Altman's films, the satirical content is evident: ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), for example, is a satirical black comedy set during the Korean War; ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971) is a satire on Westerns;&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite web |author=Wood, Robin |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/film/movie/contents/MASHed_marlowe_wood.pdf |title=Movie: A Journal of Film Criticism |id=2 |date=November 23, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Matthew Kennedy (author)|Matthew Kennedy]] states that ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) is a &quot;brilliant satire of America immediately prior to the Bicentennial&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kennedy, Matthew |url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/32/nashville.php#.UilBRNJJOSo |title=The Nashville Chronicles: The making of Robert Altman's masterpiece |series=book review |date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Wedding (1978 film)|A Wedding]]'' (1978) is a satire on American marriage rituals and hypocrisy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1023299-wedding/ |title=A Wedding |type=film review |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altman himself said that ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992) was &quot;a very mild satire&quot; about the Hollywood film industry, and [[Vincent Canby]] agreed, stating that &quot;as a satire, ''The Player'' tickles. It doesn't draw blood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Canby, Vincent |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE5DE1538F933A25757C0A964958260 |title=The Player |type=movie review |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 10, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the satire of his films sometimes led to their failure at the box office if their satirical nature was not understood by the distributor. Altman blames the box office failure of ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), a detective story, on the erroneous marketing of the film as a thriller:

{{quote|When the picture opened, it was a big, big flop. ... I went to David Picker and said, &quot;You can't do this. No wonder the fucking picture is failing. It's giving the wrong impression. You make it look like a thriller and it's not, it's a satire.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;}}

Similarly, Altman also blames the failure of ''[[O.C. &amp; Stiggs]]'' on its being marketed as a typical &quot;teenage movie,&quot; rather than what he filmed it as, a &quot;satire of a teenage movie,&quot; he said.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

=== Improvisation dialogue ===
Altman favored stories expressing the interrelationships among several characters, being more interested in character motivation than in intricate plots. He therefore tended to sketch out only a basic plot for the film, referring to the screenplay as a &quot;blueprint&quot; for action. By encouraging his actors to improvise dialogue, Altman thus became known as an &quot;actor's director,&quot; a reputation that attracted many notable actors to work as part of his large casts. Performers enjoy working with Altman in part because &quot;he provides them with the freedom to develop their characters and often alter the script through improvisation and collaboration,&quot; notes Derry. [[Richard Baskin]] says that &quot;Bob was rather extraordinary in his way of letting people do what they did. He trusted you to do what you did and therefore you would kill for him.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hillstrom /&gt;

&lt;ref name=Zuckoff/&gt;{{rp|page=282}} [[Geraldine Chaplin]], who acted in ''Nashville'', recalls one of her first rehearsal sessions:

{{quote|He said, &quot;Have you brought your scripts?&quot; We said yes. He said, &quot;Well, throw them away. You don't need them. You need to know who you are and where you are and who you're with.&quot; ... It was like being onstage with a full house every second. All the circus acts you had inside your body you'd do just for him.&lt;ref name=Zuckoff/&gt;{{rp|page=282}}}}

Altman regularly let his actors develop a character through improvisation during rehearsal or sometimes during the actual filming.&lt;ref name=Armstrong&gt;{{cite book |editor=Armstrong, Rick |title=Robert Altman: Critical essays |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |pages=12, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such improvisation was uncommon in film due to the high cost of movie production which requires careful planning, precise scripts, and rehearsal, before costly film was exposed. Nevertheless, Altman preferred to use improvisation as a tool for helping his actors develop their character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sterritt, David |title=Screening the Beats: Media culture and the beat sensibility |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |year=2004 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altman said that &quot;once we start shooting it's a very set thing. Improvisation is misunderstood. We don't just turn people loose.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite book |author=Stevens, George Jr. |title=Conversations at the American Film Institute with the Great Moviemakers |publisher=Random House |year=2012 |pages=3–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he tried to avoid dictating an actor's every move, preferring to let them be in control:

{{quote|When I cast a film, most of my creative work is done. I have to be there to turn the switch on and give them encouragement as a father figure, but they do all the work. ... All I'm trying to do is make it easy on the actor, because once you start to shoot, the actor is the artist. ... I have to give them confidence and see that they have a certain amount of protection so they can be creative. ... I let them do what they became actors for in the first place: to create.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;}}

[[Carol Burnett]] remembers Altman admitting that many of the ideas in his films came from the actors. &quot;You never hear a director say that. That was truly an astonishing thing,&quot; she said.&lt;ref name=Zuckoff/&gt;{{rp|page=328}} Others, such as [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], became creatively driven:

{{quote|He would inspire you out of sheer necessity to come up with stuff that you didn't know you were capable of, that you didn't know you had in you. He was so genuinely mischievous and so damn funny.&lt;ref name=Zuckoff/&gt;{{rp|page=435}}}}

He liked working with many of the same performers for other films, including [[Elliott Gould]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Keith Carradine]], [[Shelley Duvall]] and [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]. Krin Gabbard adds that Altman enjoyed using actors &quot;who flourish as improvisers,&quot; such as Elliott Gould, who starred in three of his films, ''MASH'', ''The Long Goodbye'' and ''California Split''.&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt; Gould recalls that when filming ''MASH'', his first acting job with Altman, he and costar [[Donald Sutherland]] didn't think Altman knew what he was doing. He wrote years later, &quot;I think that in hindsight, Donald and I were two elitist, arrogant actors who really weren't getting Altman's genius.&quot;&lt;ref name=Zuckoff/&gt;{{rp|page=174}} Others in the cast immediately appreciated Altman's directing style. [[René Auberjonois]] explains:

{{quote|We thought that's the way movies were. That they were that joyous an experience. If you had any kind of career, you quickly saw that most directors don't really trust actors, don't really want to see actors acting. That was the difference with Bob Altman. He loved actors and wanted to see acting.&lt;ref name=Zuckoff/&gt;{{rp|page=175}}}}

Unlike television and traditional films, Altman also avoided &quot;conventional storytelling,&quot; and would opt for showing the &quot;busy confusion of real life,&quot; observes Albert Lindauer.&lt;ref name=Wakeman/&gt; Among the various techniques to achieve this effect, his films often include &quot;a profusion of sounds and images, by huge casts or crazy characters, multiple plots or no plots at all, ... and a reliance on improvisation.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wakeman/&gt; A few months before he died, Altman tried to summarize the motives behind his filmmaking style:

{{quote|I equate this work more with painting than with theater or literature. Stories don't interest me. Basically, I'm more interested in behavior. I don't direct, I watch. I have to be thrilled if I expect the audience to be thrilled. Because what I really want to see from an actor is something I've never seen before, so I can't tell them what it is. I try to encourage actors not to take turns. To deal with conversation as conversation. I mean, that's what the job is, I think. It's to make a comfort area so that an actor can go beyond what he thought he could do.&lt;ref name=Zuckoff/&gt;{{rp|page=8}}}}

[[Patricia Resnick]] often wrote his screenplays.

===Sound techniques ===
Altman was one of the few filmmakers who &quot;paid full attention to the possibilities of sound&quot; when filming.&lt;ref name=Freer /&gt; He tried to replicate natural conversational sounds, even with large casts, by wiring hidden microphones to actors, then recording them talking over each other with multiple soundtracks.&lt;ref name=Freer /&gt; During the filming, he wore a headset to ensure that important dialogue could be heard, without emphasizing it. This produced a &quot;dense audio experience&quot; for viewers, allowing them to hear multiple scraps of dialogue, as if they were listening in on various private conversations. Altman recognized that although large casts hurt a film commercially, &quot;I like to see a lot of stuff going on.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

Altman first used overlapping soundtracks in ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), a sound technique which movie author Michael Barson describes as &quot;a breathtaking innovation at the time.&quot;&lt;ref name=Barson&gt;{{cite book |author=Barson, Michael |title=The Illustrated Who's-Who of Hollywood Directors |publisher=Noonday Press |year=1995 |pages=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed it, Altman said, to force viewers to pay attention and become engaged in the film as if they were an active participant.&lt;ref name=Wakeman/&gt; According to some critics, one of the more extreme uses of the technique is in ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), also considered among his finest films.&lt;ref name=Hillstrom&gt;{{cite book |editor=Hillstrom, Laurie Collier |title=International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers |volume=2 |publisher=St. James Press |year=1997 |pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ensemble casts ===
However, overlapping dialogue among large groups of actors adds complexity to Altman's films, and they were often criticized as appearing haphazard or disconnected on first viewing. Some of his critics, however, changed their mind after seeing them again. British film critic, [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], gave ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) a bad review after watching it the first time, but later wrote, &quot;But going back to ''Nashville'' and some of the earlier films, ... made me reflect: It remains enigmatic how organized or purposeful ''Nashville'' is. ... The mosaic, or mix, permits a freedom and a human idiosyncrasy that [[Jean Renoir|Renoir]] might have admired.&quot;&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomson, David |title=The New Biographical Dictionary of Film |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |place=New York, N.Y. |year=2002 |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the making of the film, the actors were inspired, and co-star [[Ronee Blakley]] was convinced of the film's ultimate success:

{{quote|Yes, I did think it was going to be great, all the work was so good, every actor was inspired, and Altman's team was intensely competent, and he was that rare kind of genius who knows what works and what doesn't at the moment it is happening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.indiewire.com/mediamatrix/00000142-1f59-d3e8-a77e-1ffb2ab80000 &quot;Ronee Blakley Reflects About Robert Altman's epic film 'Nashville'&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054947/http://blogs.indiewire.com/mediamatrix/00000142-1f59-d3e8-a77e-1ffb2ab80000 |date=November 17, 2013 }}, ''Indiewire'', Nov. 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomson later recognized those aspects as being part of Altman's style, beginning with ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970): &quot;''MASH'' began to develop the crucial Altman style of overlapping, blurred sound and images so slippery with zoom that there was no sense of composition. That is what makes ''Nashville'' so absorbing.&quot;&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt; Altman explained that to him such overlapping dialogue in his films was closer to reality, especially with large groups: &quot;If you've got fourteen people at a dinner table, it seems to me it's pretty unlikely that only two of them are going to be talking.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt; [[Pauline Kael]] writes that Altman, &quot;the master of large ensembles, loose action, and overlapping voices, demonstrates that ... he can make film fireworks out of next to nothing.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wakeman/&gt;

=== Photography ===
Altman's distinctive style of directing carried over into his preferences for camerawork. Among them was his use of widescreen compositions, intended to capture the many people or activities taking place on screen at the same time. For some films, such as ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'', he created a powerful visual atmosphere with cinematographer [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], such as scenes using fluid camerawork, zoom lenses, and a smoky effect using special fog filters.&lt;ref name=Frost&gt;{{cite book |author=Frost, Jacqueline B. |title=Cinematography for Directors: A guide for creative collaboration |publisher=Michael Wiese Productions |year=2009 |pages=46, 221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] told Altman that &quot;the camerawork was wonderful,&quot; and asked, &quot;How did you do it?&quot;&lt;ref name=Rogers/&gt;

In ''Nashville'', Altman used sets with noticeable colors of reds, whites and blues. For ''The Long Goodbye'', he insisted that Zsigmond keep the camera mobile by mounting it to moving objects.&lt;ref name=Hillstrom/&gt; Zsigmond states that Altman &quot;wanted to do something different&quot; in this film, and told him he &quot;wanted the camera to move — all the time. Up. down. In and out. Side to side.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rogers/&gt; Cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]], discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, &quot;I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a zoom lens if it was that observational, roving kind of look that Robert Altman was known for. He'd put the camera on a jib arm and float across the scene and pick out these shots as he went along – quite a nice way of working.&quot;&lt;ref name=Frost/&gt;

Zsigmond also recalls that working with Altman was fun:

{{quote|We rather enjoyed doing things &quot;improv.&quot; Altman is a great improviser. During the first few days of the shoot, he would &quot;create&quot; different approaches on a moment's notice. He would show me how he wanted the camera to move — always move. Which was fun. The actors loved it, and I was always challenged to find ways to shoot what Altman came up with.&lt;ref name=Rogers&gt;{{cite book |author=Rogers, Pauline S. |title=More Contemporary Cinematographers on Their Art |publisher=Focal Press |year=2000 |pages=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography in ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' received a nomination by the [[British Academy Film Awards]].

=== Music scores ===
When using music in his films, Altman was known to be highly selective, often choosing music that he personally liked. Director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], who worked with him, notes that &quot;Altman's use of music is always important,&quot; adding, &quot;Bob loved his music, didn't he? My God, he loved his music&quot;.&lt;ref name=Armstrong/&gt; Since he was a &quot;great fan&quot; of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s music, for example, saying he would &quot;just get stoned and play that stuff&quot; all the time&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |editor=Thompson, David |title=Altman on Altman |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |year=2010 |edition=ebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; he used three of his songs in ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), and another for the final scene in ''[[A Wedding (1978 film)|A Wedding]]'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simmons, Sylvie |title=I'm Your Man: The life of Leonard Cohen |publisher=Random House |year=2012 |at=Chapter&amp;nbsp;13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), Altman had numerous new country music songs written by his cast to create a realistic atmosphere. He incorporated a &quot;hauntingly repeated melody&quot; in ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), and employed [[Harry Nilsson]] and [[Van Dyke Parks]] to score ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name=McGilligan/&gt;{{rp|page=347}}

A number of music experts have written about Altman's use of music, including Richard R. Ness, who wrote about the scores for many of Altman's films in an article, considered to be a valuable resource for understanding Altman's filmmaking technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ness, Richard R. |contribution=Doing Some Replacin' |title=Robert Altman: Critical Essays |editor1=Rick Armstrong McFarland |year=2011 |pages=38–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, cinema studies professor Krin Gabbard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cat/people/cat_faculty/KrinGabbard.html |title=Krin Gabbard |series=Faculty |department=Cultural Analysis and Theory |publisher=Stony Brook University |website=Stonybrook.edu |accessdate=2014-08-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819185909/http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cat/people/cat_faculty/KrinGabbard.html |archive-date=August 19, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote an analysis of Altman's use of jazz music in ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993), noting that few critics have considered the &quot;importance of the music&quot; in the film.&lt;ref name=Armstrong/&gt;

Jazz was also significant in ''[[Kansas City (1996 film)|Kansas City]]'' (1996). In that film, the music is considered to be the basis of the story. Altman states that &quot;the whole idea was not to be too specific about the story,&quot; but to have the film itself be &quot;rather a sort of jazz.&quot;&lt;ref name=Self&gt;{{cite book |author=Self, Robert T. |title=Robert Altman's Subliminal Reality |publisher=Univ. of Minnesota Press |year=2002 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altman's technique of making the theme of a film a form of music, was considered &quot;an experiment nobody has tried before,&quot; with Altman admitting it was risky. &quot;I didn't know if it would work. ... If people 'get it,' then they really tend to like it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Altman&gt;{{cite book |author=Altman, Robert |title=Robert Altman: Interviews |publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi |year=2000 |page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Directors who are influenced by Altman include [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Richard Linklater]], [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], [[Noah Baumbach]], [[David Gordon Green]], and [[Michael Winterbottom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reinvented&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/19/robert-altman-genius-who-reinvented-language-of-cinema|title= Robert Altman: the genius who 'reinvented the language of cinema|website= The Guardian|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/documentary-focuses-on-director-robert-altman-1406650800|title= New Documentary Focuses on Director Robert Altman|website= The Wall Street Journal|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have noted that the work of Paul Thomas Anderson, ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997), ''[[Magnolia (1999 film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999) and ''[[Inherent Vice (film)|Inherent Vice]]'' (2014), are virtual cover versions of Altman. “I’ve stolen from Bob as best I can,” admitted Anderson, who later dedicated ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'' (2007) to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;reinvented&quot; /&gt;

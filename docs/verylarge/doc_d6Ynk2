[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] composed his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]'' around the year 1136, naming a [[Leir of Britain|King Leir]] as an [[eponymous founder]] figure.&lt;ref name=laleir&gt;Galfridus Monemutensis &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

When [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] became Lord of Leicester in 1231, he gave the city a grant to expel the Jewish population&lt;ref&gt;Mundill (2002), p265&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;in my time or in the time of any of my heirs to the end of the world&quot;. He justified his action as being &quot;for the good of my soul, and for the souls of my ancestors and successors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Maddicott 1996, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Leicester's Jews were allowed to move to the eastern suburbs, which were controlled by de Montfort's great-aunt and rival, Margaret, Countess of Winchester, after she took advice from the scholar and cleric [[Robert Grosseteste]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S (1902), p38-39&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that Jews remained there until 1253, and perhaps enforcement of the banishment within the city was not rigorously enforced. De Montfort however issued a second edict for the expulsion of Leicester's Jews in 1253, after Grosseteste's death.&lt;ref&gt;See Levy, S (1902), p39&lt;/ref&gt; De Montfort's many acts of anti-Jewish persecution in Leicester and elsewhere mass murder were part of a [[History of the Jews in England (1066–1290)#Increasing persecution, 13th century|wider pattern]] that led to the [[Edict of Expulsion|expulsion of the Jewry]] from England in 1290.&lt;ref&gt;See Mundill (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the C14th the earls of Leicester and Lancaster enhanced the prestige of the town. [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]] and of Leicester founded a hospital for the poor and infirm in the area to the south of the castle now known as The Newarke (the &quot;new work&quot;). Henry's son, the great [[Henry of Grosmont]], 4th Earl of Lancaster and of Leicester, who was made first Duke of Lancaster, enlarged and enhanced his father's foundation, and built the collegiate Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of The Newarke.&lt;ref&gt;Charles James Billson, ''Mediaeval Leicester'' (Leicester, 1920)&lt;/ref&gt; This church (a little of which survives in the basement of the Hawthorn Building of De Montfort University) was destroyed during the reign of King Edward VI. It became an important pilgrimage site because it housed a thorn said to be from the Crown of Thorns, given to the Duke by the King of France. The church (described by Leland in the C16th as &quot;not large but exceeding fair&quot;) also became, effectively, a Lancastrian mausoleum.
Duke Henry's daughter [[Blanche of Lancaster]] married [[John of Gaunt]] and their son Henry Bolingbroke became [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] when he deposed King Richard II. The Church of the Annunciation was the burial place of Duke Henry, who had earlier had his father re-interred here. Later it became the burial place of [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster]] (second wife of John of Gaunt) and of [[Mary de Bohun]], first wife of Henry Bolingbroke (Henry IV) and mother of King Henry V (she did not become queen because she died before Bolingbroke became king). John of Gaunt died at Leicester Castle in 1399. When his son became king, the Earldom of Leicester and the Duchy of Lancaster became royal titles (and the latter remains so).

At the end of the [[War of the Roses]], [[list of English kings|King]] [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] was buried in Leicester's [[Greyfriars, Leicester|Greyfriars Church]] a Franciscan Friary and Church which was demolished after its dissolution in 1538. The site of that church is now covered by more modern buildings and a car park. There was a legend his corpse had been cast into the [[River Soar|river]], while some historians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=e.g., Williamson|first1=David|title=The National Portrait Gallery History of the Kings and Queens of England|url=https://archive.org/details/nationalportrait0000will_i4a1|url-access=registration|date=1998|publisher=National Portrait Gallery Publications|page=[https://archive.org/details/nationalportrait0000will_i4a1/page/81 81]}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued his tomb and remains were destroyed during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. However, in September 2012, an archaeological investigation of the car park revealed a skeleton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard III dig: Have they found their man in Leicester?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-19575558|access-date=20 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731083750/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-19575558|archive-date=31 July 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[DNA testing]] helped verify to be related to two descendants of Richard III's sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawless|first=Jill|title=Richard III team confirms skeleton found under parking lot is remains of England's king|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/02/04/richard_iii_team_confirms_skeleton_found_under_parking_lot_is_remains_of_englands_king.html|newspaper=The Star|date=4 February 2013|access-date=2 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628165109/https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/02/04/richard_iii_team_confirms_skeleton_found_under_parking_lot_is_remains_of_englands_king.html|archive-date=28 June 2017|url-status=live}}j&lt;/ref&gt; It was concluded that the skeleton was that of Richard III because of the DNA evidence and the shape of the spine. In 2015 Richard III was reburied in pride of place near the high altar in [[Leicester Cathedral]].

On 4 November 1530, [[Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]] was arrested on charges of treason and taken from [[York Place]]. On his way south to face dubious justice at the [[Tower of London]], he fell ill. The group escorting him was concerned enough to stop at Leicester to rest at Leicester Abbey. There, Wolsey's condition quickly worsened. He died on 29 November 1530 and was buried at [[Leicester Abbey]], now [[Abbey Park, Leicestershire|Abbey Park]].

[[Lady Jane Grey]], who claimed the English throne for nine days in June 1553, was born at [[Bradgate Park]] near Leicester around 1536.&lt;ref name=&quot;royweb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page44.asp |title=Official Website of the British Monarchy – Jane |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501194655/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page44.asp |archivedate=1 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen [[Elizabeth I]]'s intimate and former suitor, [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]], was given the [[Earldom of Leicester]].

====Stuart====
The Corporation of Leicester opposed the efforts of [[Charles I of England]] to disafforest the nearby [[Leicester Forest]], believing them to be likely to throw many of its residents into poverty and need of relief. [[Miles Fleetwood|Sir Miles Fleetwood]] was sent to commission the disafforestation and division of lands being used in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = University of California Press |isbn = 0-520-03681-6 |location = Berkeley |title = In contempt of all authority |author = Buchanan Sharp |date = 1980 |id = 0520036816 |ol = 4742314M }}p70-71&lt;/ref&gt; Riots destroyed enclosures in spring 1627 and 1628, following a pattern of [[Western Rising and disafforestation riots|anti-enclosure disturbances]] found elsewhere including the Western Rising.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Petitions challenging the enclosures were presented by the Corporation of Leicester and borough residents to the King and [[Privy Council]]. They were unsuccessful so petitioned the [[House of Lords]] in June 1628 who however supported Fleetwood but asked for proceedings made by the Crown against the rioters to be dropped. Compensation made to the legal residents of the forest was reasonably generous by comparison with other forests. The Corporation of Leicester received {{convert|40|acres|0|abbr=on}} for relief of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p88&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil War====
Leicester was a Parliamentarian (colloquially called [[Roundhead]]) stronghold during the [[English Civil War]]. In 1645, King [[Charles I of England]] and [[Prince Rupert]] decided to attack the (then) town to draw the [[New Model Army]] away from the Royalist (colloquially called [[Cavaliers]]) headquarters of [[Oxford]]. [[Royalist]] guns were set up on [[Raw Dykes]] and, after an unsatisfactory response to a demand for surrender, the assault began at 3pm on 30 May 1645 by a Royalist battery opposite the Newarke. The town - which only had approximately 2,000 defenders opposed to the Royalist Army of approximately 10,000 combatants - was sacked on 31 May 1645, and hundreds of people were killed by Rupert's cavalry. One witness said, &quot;they fired upon our men out of their windows, from the tops of houses, and threw tiles upon their heads. Finding one house better manned than ordinary, and many shots fired at us out of the windows, I caused my men to attack it, and resolved to make them an example for the rest; which they did. Breaking open the doors, they killed all they found there without distinction&quot;. It was reported that 120 houses had been destroyed and that 140 wagons of plunder were sent to the Royalist stronghold of [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1645-leicester-naseby.htm|title=1645:The Storming of Leicester and the Battle of Naseby|access-date=25 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509100109/http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1645-leicester-naseby.htm|archive-date=9 May 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Parliamentarian victory over the Royalist Army at the [[Battle of Naseby]] on 14 June 1645 Leicester was recovered by Parliament on 18 June 1645.

====Industrial era====
[[File:Butler Leicester Seamstress front.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Leicester Seamstress'' by [[James Butler (artist)|James Walter Butler]] (1990)&lt;br /&gt;Leicester, Hotel Street]]
The construction of the [[Grand Union Canal]] in the 1790s linked Leicester to London and [[Birmingham]]. The first railway station in Leicester opened in 1832, in the form of The [[Leicester and Swannington Railway]] which provided a supply of coal to the town from nearby collieries.{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=141}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Leicester|last=Elliott|first=Malcolm|publisher=Phillimore|year=1979|isbn=0-85033-327-X|location=London and Chichester|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Midland Counties Railway]] (running from Derby to Rugby) linked the town to the national network by 1840. A direct link to London [[St Pancras Station]] was established by the [[Midland Main Line|Midland]] Railway in the 1860s. These developments encouraged and accompanied a [[Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom|process of industrialisation]] which intensified throughout the reign of [[Queen Victoria]]. Factories began to appear, particularly along the canal and river, and districts such as [[Frog Island, Leicester|Frog Island]] and [[Woodgate, Leicestershire|Woodgate]] were the locations of numerous large mills. Between 1861 and 1901, Leicester's population increased from {{nowrap|68,100}} to {{nowrap|211,600}} {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}and the proportion employed in trade, commerce, building, and the city's new factories and workshops rose steadily. Hosiery, textiles, and footwear became the major industrial employers: manufacturers such as [[N. Corah &amp; Sons]] and the Cooperative Boot and Shoe Company were opening some of the largest manufacturing premises in Europe. They were joined, in the latter part of the century, by engineering firms such as Kent Street's Taylor and Hubbard (crane makers and founders{{clarify|date=December 2014}}), Vulcan Road's [[Gimson and Company|William Gimson &amp; Company]] (steam boilers and founders), and Martin Street's Richards &amp; Company (steel works and founders).

The politics of Victorian Leicester were lively and very often bitter. Years of consistent economic growth meant living standards generally increased, but Leicester was a stronghold of [[Radicals (UK)|Radicalism]]. [[Thomas Cooper (poet)|Thomas Cooper]], the [[Chartism|Chartist]], kept a shop in Church Gate.  There were serious Chartist riots in the town in 1842 and again six years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/chartism/leicchar.htm|website=A Web of English History|publisher=Dr Marjie Bloy|title=Chartism in Leicestershire|access-date=23 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115108/http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/chartism/leicchar.htm|archive-date=26 August 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Leicester Secular Society]] was founded in 1851 but [[secularism|secularist]] speakers such as [[George Holyoake]] were often denied the use of speaking halls. It was not until 1881 that [[Leicester Secular Hall]] was opened. The second half of the 19th century also witnessed the creation of many other institutions, including the town council, the Royal Infirmary, and the Leicester Constabulary. It also benefited from general acceptance (and the Public Health Acts ){{citation needed|date=February 2016}} that municipal organisations had a responsibility to provide for the town's water supply, drainage, and sanitation. In 1853, backed with a guarantee of dividends by the Corporation of Leicester the Leicester Waterworks Company built a reservoir at Thornton for the supply of water to the town . This guarantee was made possible by the Public Health Act 1847 and an amending local Act of Parliament of 1851. In 1866 another amending Act enabled the Corporation of Leicester to take shares in the company to enable another reservoir at Cropston, completed in 1870. The Corporation of Leicester was later able to buy the waterworks and build another reservoir at Swithland, completed in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Malcolm.op cit pages 62 -64 and 124-135&lt;/ref&gt;

Leicester became a [[county borough]] in 1889, although it was abolished with the rest in 1974 as part of the [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government Act]]. The city regained its unitary status apart from Leicestershire in 1997. The borough had been expanding throughout the 19th century, but grew most notably when it annexed [[Belgrave, Leicestershire|Belgrave]], [[Aylestone]], [[North Evington]], [[Knighton, Leicestershire|Knighton]], and [[Stoneygate]] in 1892.

====Early 20th century====
[[File:Clock Tower and Eastgates c1910.jpg|thumb|Edwardian Leicester]]
In 1900, the [[Great Central Railway]] provided another link to London, but the rapid population growth of the previous decades had already begun to slow by the time of Queen Victoria's death in 1901.

[[File:Leicester Arch of Remembrance (front, 07) cropped.jpg|thumb|The [[Arch of Remembrance]] in [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]]]]
[[World War I]] and the subsequent epidemics had further impacts. Nonetheless, Leicester was finally recognised as a legal city once more in 1919 in recognition of its contribution to the British war effort. Recruitment to the armed forces was lower in Leicester than in other English cities, partly because of the low level of unemployment and the need for many of its industries, such as clothing and footwear manufacturing, to supply the army. As the war progressed, many of Leicester's factories were given over to arms production; Leicester produced the first batch of Howitzer shells by a British company which was not making ammunition before the war. After the war, the city received a royal visit; the king and queen received a march-past in [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]] of thousands of serving and demobilised soldiers. Following the end of the war, a memorial arch—the [[Arch of Remembrance]]—was built in Victoria Park and unveiled in 1925. The arch, one of the largest First World War memorials in the UK, was designed by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], who also designed [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] in London and is a grade I [[listed building]]. A set of gates and lodges, again by Lutyens, were added in the 1930s, leading to the memorial from the University Road and London Road entrances to Victoria Park.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1074786|desc=The Arch of Remembrance|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Leicester again became a cathedral city on the consecration of {{nowrap|St Martin's}} Church as the cathedral. A second major extension to the boundaries following the changes in 1892 took place in 1935, with the annexation of the remainder of [[Evington]], [[Humberstone, Leicestershire|Humberstone]], [[Beaumont Leys]], and part of [[Braunstone Park and Rowley Fields|Braunstone]]. A third major revision of the boundaries took place in 1966, with the net addition to the city of just over {{convert|450|acres|0|abbr=on}}. The boundary has remained unchanged since that time.

Leicester's diversified economic base and lack of dependence on primary industries meant it was much better placed than many other cities to weather the tariff wars of the 1920s and [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. The Bureau of Statistics of the newly formed [[League of Nations]] identified Leicester in 1936 as the 2nd-richest city in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=William|first1=David|title=UK Cities: A Look at Life and Major Cities in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland|date=13 October 2010|publisher=New Africa Press|isbn=978-9987160211|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became an attractive destination for refugees fleeing persecution and political turmoil in [[continental Europe]]. Firms such as Corah and [[Liberty Shoes (Leicester, England)|Liberty Shoes]] used their reputation for producing high-quality products to expand their businesses. These years witnessed the growth in the city of [[trade unionism]] and particularly the [[co-operative movement]]. The Co-op became an important employer and landowner; when Leicester played host to the [[Jarrow March]] on its way to London in 1936, the Co-op provided the marchers with a change of boots. In 1938, Leicester was selected as the base for Squadron 1F, the first A.D.C.C (Air Defence Cadet Corp), the predecessor of the [[Air Training Corps]].

===Contemporary===

The years after [[World War II]], particularly from the 1960s onwards, brought many social and economic challenges.

====Urban expansion; central rapprochement====

[[File:Aerial-Leicester 2017.jpg|thumb|275px| Central Leicester (looking WNW)]]
Mass housebuilding continued across Leicester for some 30 years after 1945. Existing housing estates such as Braunstone were expanded, while several completely new estates – of both private and council tenure – were built.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The last major development of this era was Beaumont Leys in the north of the city, which was developed in the 1970s as a mix of private and council housing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} There was a steady decline in Leicester's traditional manufacturing industries and, in the city centre, working factories and light industrial premises have now been almost entirely replaced. Many former factories, including some on [[Frog Island, Leicester|Frog Island]] and at [[River Soar#Donisthorpe Mill|Donisthorpe Mill]], have been badly damaged by fire. Rail and barge were finally eclipsed by automotive transport in the 1960s and 1970s: the Great Central and the Leicester and Swannington both closed and the northward extension of the [[M1 motorway]] linked Leicester into England's growing motorway network.  With the loss of much of the city's industry during the 1970s and 1980s, some of the old industrial jobs were replaced by new jobs in the service sector, particularly in retail. The opening of the Haymarket Shopping Centre in 1971 was followed by a number of new shopping centres in the city, including St Martin's Shopping Centre in 1984 and the Shire Shopping Centre in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/leicester.html|title=A History of Leicester|accessdate=29 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704145750/http://www.localhistories.org/leicester.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shires was subsequently expanded in September 2008 and rebranded as Highcross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highcrossleicester.com/website/tm_highcross.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117114435/http://www.highcrossleicester.com/website/tm_highcross.aspx |archivedate=17 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, as well, Leicester's central position and good transport links had established it as a distribution centre; the southwestern area of the city has also attracted new service and manufacturing businesses.

====Immigration====

[[File:Leicester city council advert on Ugandan Argus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1972 advertisement in the ''[[New Vision|Uganda Argus]]'' newspaper to discourage Ugandan Asians from settling in Leicester]]
Since World War II Leicester has experienced large scale immigration from across the world. Many Polish servicemen were prevented from returning to their homeland after the war by the communist regime,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/982.html|title=Poles|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|access-date=2018-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210034745/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/982.html|archive-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they established a small community in Leicester. Economic migrants from the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish Republic]] continued to arrive throughout the post war period.

In the 1990s, a group of Dutch citizens of [[Somali people|Somali]] origin settled in the city. Since the 2004 [[enlargement of the European Union]] a significant number of [[East European]] migrants have settled in the city. While some wards in the northeast of the city are more than 70% South Asian, wards in the west and south are all over 70% white. The [[Commission for Racial Equality]] (CRE) had estimated that by 2011 Leicester would have approximately a 50% ethnic minority population, making it the first city in Britain not to have an indigenous [[white British]] majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0cq.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm Equality and Human Rights Commission – home page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020356/http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0cq.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction was based on the growth of the ethnic minority populations between 1991 (Census 1991 28% ethnic minority) and 2001 (Census 2001 – 36% ethnic minority). However, Professor Ludi Simpson at the [[University of Manchester]] School of Social Sciences said in September 2007 that the CRE had &quot;made unsubstantiated claims and ignored government statistics&quot; and that Leicester's immigrant and minority communities disperse to other places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/news/unilife/1007/research/#d.en.124216 | title=Research (The University of Manchester) }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/research/mrpd/events/documents/BSPS07SimpsonFinneyMinorityWhiteCities.doc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129182053/http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/research/mrpd/events/documents/BSPS07SimpsonFinneyMinorityWhiteCities.doc|url-status=dead|title=Research2|archivedate=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0cq.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm |title=Research |work=cre.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020356/http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0cq.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leicester Multicultural Advisory Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.media4diversity.eu/|title=Media4diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a forum, set up in 2001 by the editor of the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'', to co-ordinate community relations with members representing the council, police, schools, community and faith groups, and the media.

====Coronavirus====

The [[Covid-19 pandemic|Coronavirus pandemic]] has brought many social and economic challenges across the country and across the world. Leicester has been particularly badly affected in the United Kingdom from July 2020 during the imposition of the first local lockdown which saw all non-essential retail closed again and businesses such as public houses, restaurants and hairdressers unable to reopen. Businesses such as these in areas such as Glenfield and that part of Braunstone Town which outside of the formal City Council area have since been allowed to reopen following a more tightly defined lockdown area from 18 July 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-53447863|title=Leicester lockdown: 'I needn't have cancelled our holiday'|date=18 July 2020|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/754/contents/made|title=The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Leicester) (Amendment) Regulations 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Office for National Statistics]] has defined a [[Leicester Urban Area]] (LUA); broadly the immediate Leicester [[conurbation]], although without administrative status. The LUA contains the unitary authority area and several towns, villages and suburbs outside the city's administrative boundaries.

===Climate===
[[File:Spinney Hills Park, Leicester.jpg|thumb|upright|Snow in Spinney Hill Park, 2007]]
Leicester experiences a [[maritime climate]] with mild to warm summers and cool winters, rain spread throughout the year, and low sunshine levels.

==Governance==
On 5 May 2011, the [[directly elected]] [[Mayor of Leicester]] role came into effect after the inaugural election. This post exists in addition to that of Lord Mayor, which these days is a ceremonial post.

The first mayor of Leicester was a [[Normans|Norman]] knight, Peter fitz Roger (&quot;Peter, son of Roger&quot;) in 1251.&lt;ref&gt;Agnes Johnson Glimpses of ancient Leicester – Page 60 1891 &quot;The first Mayor of Leicester, A.D. 1251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The history of the boroughs and municipal corporations of the ... – Page 229 [[Henry Alworth Merewether]], Archibald John Stephens – 1835 &quot;The mayor of Leicester and his brethren, having, with the consent of the commonalty, by the last ordinance, placed the town under the government of the aldermen, appear, in the 4th year of the reign of King Henry VII., to have adopted 1488. a ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Following the restoration of city status this title was elevated to &quot;Lord Mayor.&quot; In 1987 the first Asian Mayor of Leicester was indirectly elected by the councillors, Councillor Gordhan Parmar.&lt;ref&gt;What participation by foreign residents in public life at local ... – Page 91 Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe – 2000 &quot;In 1981 serious riots broke out in the city that were dubbed &quot;race riots&quot; in Highfields and the City centre. ...

On 1 April 1997, [[Leicester City Council]] became a [[unitary authority]]. Previously, local government had been a two-tier system: the city and county councils were responsible for different aspects of local-government services. That system is still in place in the rest of Leicestershire. [[Leicestershire County Council]] retained its headquarters at County Hall in [[Glenfield, Leicestershire|Glenfield]], just outside the city boundary but within the urban area. The administrative offices of Leicester City Council are in the centre of the city at 115 Charles Street, having moved from Welford Place. The buildings at Welford Place have been demolished and the site is to be developed into a complex of offices and plazas. Some services (particularly the police and the ambulance service) still cover the whole of the city and county, but for the most part the councils are independent.

Leicester is divided into 21 electoral wards: Abbey, Aylestone, Beaumont Leys, Belgrave, Braunstone Park &amp; Rowley Fields, Castle, Evington, Eyres Monsell, Fosse, Humberstone &amp; Hamilton, Knighton, North Evington, Rushey Mead, Saffron, Spinney Hills, Stoneygate, Thurncourt, Troon, Westcotes, Western, and Wycliffe.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.leicester.gov.uk/media/179879/city-mayor-and-ward-councillors-july-2016.pdf Leicester City Mayor and Councillors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221145203/http://www.leicester.gov.uk/media/179879/city-mayor-and-ward-councillors-july-2016.pdf |date=21 December 2016 }}&quot;, Leicester City Council, July 2016. Retrieved 13 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political control===
The current directly elected Mayor is Sir Peter Soulsby of the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=6 May 2011|title=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-13309051|url-status=live|access-date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sir Peter Soulsby|url=http://www.cabinet.leicester.gov.uk:8071/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=955|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107023414/http://www.cabinet.leicester.gov.uk:8071/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=955|archive-date=7 November 2018|access-date=16 August 2020|website=Leicester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long period of Labour administration (since 1979), the city council from May 2003 was run by a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]]/[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] coalition under [[Roger Blackmore]], which collapsed in November 2004. The minority Labour group ran the city until May 2005, under Ross Willmott, when the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives formed a new coalition, again under the leadership of Roger Blackmore.

In the local government elections of 3 May 2007, Leicester's Labour Party once again took control of the council in what can be described as a [[landslide victory]]. Gaining 18 new councillors, Labour polled on the day 38 councillors, creating a governing majority of +20. Significantly however, the Green Party gained its first councillors in the Castle Ward, after losing on the drawing of lots in 2003, though one of these subsequently resigned and the seat was lost to Labour in a by-election on 10 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicester.gov.uk/councillors-democracy-and-elections/elections-and-electoral-registration/elections/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204234623/https://www.leicester.gov.uk/councillors-democracy-and-elections/elections-and-electoral-registration/elections/ |archivedate= 4 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party saw a decrease in their representation. The Liberal Democrat Party was the major loser, dropping from 25 councillors in 2003 to only 6 in 2007. This was in part due to the local party splitting, with a number of councillors standing for the [[Liberal Party|Liberal Party (UK, 1989)]].

In the local government elections of 5 May 2011 and those of May 2015, Labour won 52 of the city's 54 seats, with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats winning one seat each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicester.gov.uk/elections2011/wardResults.aspx|title=Elections and voting|access-date=7 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509042623/http://www.leicester.gov.uk/elections2011/wardResults.aspx|archive-date=9 May 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2019 local elections, the Labour Party gained the sole Conservative held ward of Knighton leaving [[Nigel Porter]] of the Liberal Democrats as the only opposition member on the City Council.

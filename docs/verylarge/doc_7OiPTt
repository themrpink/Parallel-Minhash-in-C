===Origins of forensic science and early methods===
{{main|Forensics in antiquity}}
The [[Ancient history|ancient world]] lacked standardized forensic practices, which enabled criminals to escape punishment. Criminal investigations and trials relied heavily on forced [[Confession (law)|confessions]] and witness [[testimony]]. However, ancient sources do contain several accounts of techniques that foreshadow concepts in forensic science developed centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schafer|first=Elizabeth D.|title=Forensic Science|url=https://archive.org/details/forensicscience00emba|url-access=limited|chapter=Ancient science and forensics |editor=Ayn Embar-seddon |editor2=Allan D.

The first written account of using [[medicine]] and [[entomology]] to solve criminal cases is attributed to the book of [[Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified|''Xi Yuan Lu'']] (translated as ''Washing Away of Wrongs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/forensics/timeline.html |title=Forensics Timeline |publisher=Cbsnews.com |accessdate=2011-12-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629040006/http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/forensics/timeline.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vizproto.prism.asu.edu/classes/sp05/todd_c/forensic_site/intro.html A Brief Background of Forensic Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216092646/http://vizproto.prism.asu.edu/classes/sp05/todd_c/forensic_site/intro.html |date=16 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), written in China in 1248 by [[Song Ci]] (宋慈, 1186–1249), a director of justice, jail and supervision,&lt;ref&gt;Song, Ci, and Brian E.

In one of Song Ci's accounts (''Washing Away of Wrongs''), the case of a person murdered with a sickle was solved by an investigator who instructed each suspect to bring his sickle to one location. (He realized it was a sickle by testing various blades on an animal carcass and comparing the wounds.) Flies, attracted by the smell of blood, eventually gathered on a single sickle. In light of this, the owner of that sickle confessed to the murder. As other  examples, the book also described how to distinguish between a [[drowning]] (water in the [[lungs]]) and [[strangulation]] (broken neck [[cartilage]]), and described evidence from examining corpses to determine if a death was caused by murder, suicide or accident.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Methods from around the world involved saliva and examination of the mouth and tongue to determine innocence or guilt, as a precursor to the [[Polygraph test]]. In ancient India,&lt;ref name=EDodD&gt;{{cite book|last=Parmeshwaranand|first=Swami|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the Dharmaśāstra, Volume 1|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|location=New Delhi|isbn=8176253650|page=499|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDQVereyvj4C&amp;pg=PA499 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; some suspects were made to fill their mouths with dried rice and spit it back out. Similarly, in ancient [[China]], those accused of a crime would have rice powder placed in their mouths.&lt;ref&gt;McCrie, Robert D. &quot;General Managerial Fundamentals and Competencies&quot;. ''Security Operations Management''. 1st ed. Amsterdam: Butterworth-Heinemann/Elsevier, 2007. 93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient [[Middle-East|middle-eastern]] cultures, the accused were made to lick hot metal rods briefly. It is thought that these tests had some validity{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} since a guilty person would produce less saliva and thus have a drier mouth; the accused would be considered guilty if rice was sticking to their mouths in abundance or if their tongues were severely burned due to lack of shielding from saliva.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Development of forensic science===
[[File:Ambroise Paré.jpg|thumb|[[Ambroise Paré]]'s surgical work laid the groundwork for the development of forensic techniques in the following centuries.]]
In 16th-century Europe, medical practitioners in army and university settings began to gather information on the cause and [[manner of death]]. [[Ambroise Paré]], a French army [[surgery|surgeon]], systematically studied the effects of violent death on internal organs.&lt;ref name=GAB&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive ...|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465037186|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xfs8tC8Ow0C&amp;pg=PA79|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723015656/https://books.google.com/books?id=8xfs8tC8Ow0C&amp;pg=PA79|archivedate=23 July 2016|date=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Roy|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science|page=805|author2=Lorraine Daston|author3=Katharine Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Italian people|Italian]] surgeons, Fortunato Fidelis and Paolo Zacchia, laid the foundation of modern [[pathology]] by studying changes that occurred in the structure of the body as the result of disease.&lt;ref name=THSC&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suter|first1=Patricia|title=The Hanging of Susanna Cox: The True Story of Pennsylvania's Most Notorious Infanticide and the Legend that Kept it Alive|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=Mechanicsberg|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frLETA3uU08C&amp;q=Fortunato+Fidelis+and+Paolo+Zacchia&amp;pg=PA20|author2=Russell D. Earnest|author3=Corinne P. Earnest|isbn=9780811705608|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 18th century, writings on these topics began to appear. These included ''A Treatise on Forensic Medicine and Public Health'' by the French physician [[Francois Immanuele Fodéré]]&lt;ref name=HoFM&gt;{{cite book|last=Madea|first=Burkhard|title=Handbook of Forensic Medicine|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|location=Sussex|isbn=9780470979990|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLQZAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR5|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505230656/https://books.google.com/books?id=QLQZAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=5 May 2016|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Complete System of Police Medicine'' by the German medical expert [[Johann Peter Frank]].&lt;ref name=MaSiEM&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindemann|first=Mary|title=Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe|publisher=University of Cambridge|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521412544|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQxAkrbksTEC&amp;pg=PA135|date=28 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the rational values of the [[Enlightenment era]] increasingly permeated society in the 18th century, criminal investigation became a more evidence-based, rational procedure − the use of torture to force confessions was curtailed, and belief in witchcraft and other powers of the [[occult]] largely ceased to influence the court's decisions. Two examples of English forensic science in individual legal proceedings demonstrate the increasing use of [[logic]] and procedure in criminal investigations at the time. In 1784, in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], John Toms was tried and convicted for murdering Edward Culshaw with a [[pistol]]. When the dead body of Culshaw was examined, a pistol wad (crushed paper used to secure powder and balls in the muzzle) found in his head wound matched perfectly with a torn newspaper found in Toms's pocket, leading to the conviction.&lt;ref name=SW&gt;{{cite book|last=McCrery|first=Nigel|title=Silent Witnesses|publisher=Random House Books|location=London|isbn=9781847946836|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dynVJYcteEkC&amp;pg=PA51|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513220434/https://books.google.com/books?id=dynVJYcteEkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=13 May 2016|date=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Warwick]] 1816, a farm laborer was tried and convicted of the murder of a young maidservant. She had been drowned in a shallow pool and bore the marks of violent assault. The police found footprints and an impression from corduroy cloth with a sewn patch in the damp earth near the pool. There were also scattered grains of [[wheat]] and chaff. The breeches of a farm labourer who had been threshing wheat nearby were examined and corresponded exactly to the impression in the earth near the pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science Against Crime|vauthors=Kind S, Overman M|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|year=1972|isbn=0-385-09249-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/scienceagainstcr00kind/page/12 12–13]|url=https://archive.org/details/scienceagainstcr00kind/page/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxicology===
A method for detecting arsenious oxide, simple [[arsenic]], in corpses was devised in 1773 by the Swedish chemist, [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]].&lt;ref name=DPaC&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Suzanne|title=Drugs, Poisons, and Chemistry|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|isbn=978-0816055104|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lq8IvpohnCwC&amp;pg=PA8|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427082830/https://books.google.com/books?id=lq8IvpohnCwC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=27 April 2016|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was expanded upon, in 1806, by German chemist Valentin Ross, who learned to detect the poison in the walls of a victim's stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic Analysis and DNA in Criminal Investigations: Including Cold Cases Solved|last=Parker|first=RJ|publisher=RJ Parker Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781514348369|location=|pages=66|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Marsh test apparatus.jpg|thumb|left|Apparatus for the arsenic test, devised by [[James Marsh (chemist)|James Marsh]]]]
[[James Marsh (chemist)|James Marsh]] was the first to apply this new science to the art of forensics. He was called by the prosecution in a murder trial to give evidence as a chemist in 1832. The defendant, John Bodle, was accused of poisoning his grandfather with arsenic-laced coffee. Marsh performed the standard test by mixing a suspected sample with [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]. While he was able to detect arsenic as yellow [[arsenic trisulfide]], when it was shown to the jury it had deteriorated, allowing the suspect to be acquitted due to reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/technologies/marsh.html |title=Visible Proofs: Forensic Views of the Body: Galleries: Technologies: The Marsh test |accessdate=2015-11-04 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007131101/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/technologies/marsh.html |archivedate=7 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annoyed by that, Marsh developed a much better test. He combined a sample containing arsenic with [[sulfuric acid]] and arsenic-free [[zinc]], resulting in [[arsine]] gas. The gas was ignited, and it decomposed to pure metallic arsenic, which, when passed to a cold surface, would appear as a silvery-black deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McMuigan|first=Hugh|title=An Introduction to Chemical Pharmacology|publisher=P. Blakiston's Son &amp; Co.|year=1921|location=Philadelphia|pages=396–397|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4I6AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; So sensitive was the test, known formally as the [[Marsh test]], that it could detect as little as one-fiftieth of a milligram of arsenic. He first described this test in ''The Edinburgh Philosophical Journal'' in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Account of a method of separating small quantities of arsenic from substances with which it may be mixed|journal=Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal|volume=21|year=1836|pages=229–236|author=James Marsh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FR4AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA229|publisher=A. and C.

=== Ballistics ===
{{Main|Forensic firearm examination}}
Henry Goddard at [[Scotland Yard]] pioneered the use of bullet comparison in 1835. He noticed a flaw in the bullet that killed the victim and was able to trace this back to the mold that was used in the manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.bryant.edu/~ehu/h453proj/forensic1/Ballistics.htm|title=Ballistics|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017052224/http://web.bryant.edu/~ehu/h453proj/forensic1/Ballistics.htm|archivedate=17 October 2014|access-date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropometry===
[[Image:Bertillon - Signalement Anthropometrique.png|right|thumb|150px|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] from [[Alphonse Bertillon|Bertillon's]] ''Identification anthropométrique'' (1893), demonstrating the measurements needed for his anthropometric identification system]]
The French police officer [[Alphonse Bertillon]] was the first to apply the anthropological technique of [[anthropometry]] to law enforcement, thereby creating an identification system based on physical measurements. Before that time, criminals could be identified only by name or photograph.&lt;ref&gt;As reported in, &quot;A Fingerprint Fable: The Will and William West Case&quot;. {{cite web |url=http://www.scafo.org/library/110105.html |title=SCAFO Online Articles |accessdate=2005-12-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110105229/http://www.scafo.org/library/110105.html |archivedate=10 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirsten Moana Thompson 2007&quot;&gt;Kirsten Moana Thompson, ''Crime Films: Investigating the Scene''.

Bertillon created many other [[forensics]] techniques, including [[forensic document examination]], the use of [[galvanoplastic]] compounds to preserve [[footprint]]s, [[ballistics]], and the [[dynamometer]], used to determine the degree of force used in [[burglary|breaking and entering]]. Although his central methods were soon to be supplanted by [[fingerprinting]], &quot;his other contributions like the [[mug shot]] and the systematization of crime-scene photography remain in place to this day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirsten Moana Thompson 2007&quot;/&gt;

===Fingerprints===
Sir [[Sir William Herschel, 2nd Baronet|William Herschel]] was one of the first to advocate the use of fingerprinting in the identification of criminal suspects. While working for the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]], he began to use thumbprints on documents as a security measure to prevent the then-rampant repudiation of signatures in 1858.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herschel1916&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=William J|last=Herschel|title=The Origin of Finger-Printing|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1916|isbn=978-1-104-66225-7|url=http://galton.org/fingerprints/books/herschel/herschel-1916-origins-1up.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725022215/http://galton.org/fingerprints/books/herschel/herschel-1916-origins-1up.pdf|archivedate=25 July 2011|access-date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fingerprints taken by William James Herschel 1859-1860.jpg|thumb|left|Fingerprints taken by [[William Herschel]] 1859/60]]
In 1877 at Hooghly (near Kolkata), Herschel instituted the use of fingerprints on contracts and deeds, and he registered government pensioners' fingerprints to prevent the collection of money by relatives after a pensioner's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=William James|last=Herschel|title=Skin furrows of the hand|journal=Nature|volume=23|issue=578|page=76|date=25 November 1880|bibcode=1880Natur..23...76H|doi=10.1038/023076b0|s2cid=4068612|url=http://galton.org/fingerprints/herschel-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615200727/http://galton.org/fingerprints/herschel-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|archivedate=15 June 2011|access-date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Dr. [[Henry Faulds]], a Scottish surgeon in a [[Tokyo]] hospital, published his first paper on the subject in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', discussing the usefulness of fingerprints for identification and proposing a method to record them with printing ink. He established their first classification and was also the first to identify fingerprints left on a vial.&lt;ref name=faulds1&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.galton.org/fingerprints/faulds-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|last=Faulds|first=Henry|title=On the skin-furrows of the hand|journal=Nature|volume=22|issue=574|page=605|date=28 October 1880|doi=10.1038/022605a0|bibcode=1880Natur..22..605F|s2cid=4117214|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912031154/http://www.galton.org/fingerprints/faulds-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2008|access-date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the UK in 1886, he offered the concept to the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London, but it was dismissed at that time.&lt;ref name=reid1&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Donald L.|year=2003|title=Dr. Henry Faulds – Beith Commemorative Society|journal=Journal of Forensic Identification|volume=53|issue=2}} See also this on-line article on Henry Faulds: {{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/fingerprints/faulds.htm#herschel1880|title=Henry Faulds: the Invention of a Fingerprinter|first=Gavan|last=Tredoux|date=December 2003|publisher=galton.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602152655/http://galton.org/fingerprints/faulds.htm#herschel1880|archivedate=2 June 2013|access-date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulds wrote to [[Charles Darwin]] with a description of his method, but, too old and ill to work on it, Darwin gave the information to his cousin, [[Francis Galton]], who was interested in anthropology. Having been thus inspired to study fingerprints for ten years, Galton published a detailed statistical model of fingerprint analysis and identification and encouraged its use in forensic science in his book ''Finger Prints''. He had calculated that the chance of a &quot;false positive&quot; (two different individuals having the same fingerprints) was about 1 in 64 billion.&lt;ref name=galtonfps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clpex.com/Information/Pioneers/galton-1892-fingerprints-lowres.pdf|last=Galton|first=Francis|year=1892|title=Finger Prints|location=London|publisher=MacMillan and Co|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012152917/http://www.clpex.com/Information/Pioneers/galton-1892-fingerprints-lowres.pdf|archivedate=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fingerprinting 1928.jpg|thumb|Women clerical employees of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LA Police Department]] getting [[fingerprint]]ed and photographed in 1928]]
[[Juan Vucetich]], an Argentine chief police officer, created the first method of recording the fingerprints of individuals on file. In 1892, after studying Galton's pattern types, Vucetich set up the world's first fingerprint bureau. In that same year, Francisca Rojas of [[Necochea]] was found in a house with neck injuries whilst her two sons were found dead with their throats cut. Rojas accused a neighbour, but despite brutal interrogation, this neighbour would not confess to the crimes. Inspector Alvarez, a colleague of Vucetich, went to the scene and found a bloody thumb mark on a door. When it was compared with Rojas' prints, it was found to be identical with her right thumb. She then confessed to the murder of her sons.

A Fingerprint Bureau was established in Calcutta ([[Kolkata]]), India, in 1897, after the Council of the Governor General approved a committee report that fingerprints should be used for the classification of criminal records. Working in the Calcutta Anthropometric Bureau, before it became the Fingerprint Bureau, were [[Azizul Haque (police officer)|Azizul Haque]] and [[Hem Chandra Bose]]. Haque and Bose were Indian fingerprint experts who have been credited with the primary development of a fingerprint classification system eventually named after their supervisor, [[Edward Henry|Sir Edward Richard Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tewari|first1=RK|last2=Ravikumar|first2=KV|title=History and development of forensic science in India|journal=J Postgrad Med|year=2000|volume=46|issue=46|pages=303–308|pmid=11435664}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jan102005/185.pdf|first1=J.S.|last1=Sodhi|first2=asjeed|last2=Kaur|title=The forgotten Indian pioneers of finger print science|journal=Current Science|year=2005|volume=88|issue=1|pages=185–191|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208112115/http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jan102005/185.pdf|archivedate=8 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Henry Classification System]], co-devised by Haque and Bose, was accepted in England and Wales when the first United Kingdom Fingerprint Bureau was founded in [[Scotland Yard]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] headquarters, London, in 1901. Sir Edward Richard Henry subsequently achieved improvements in dactyloscopy.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the United States, Dr. Henry P. DeForrest used fingerprinting in the [[New York Police Department|New York Civil Service]] in 1902, and by December 1905, [[New York City Police Department]] Deputy Commissioner Joseph A. Faurot, an expert in the [[Alphonse Bertillon|Bertillon]] system and a fingerprint advocate at Police Headquarters, introduced the fingerprinting of criminals to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to U.S. 23 Dec 1905 New York – The City Record Volume 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uhlenhuth test===
The [[Uhlenhuth test]], or the antigen–antibody [[precipitin]] test for species, was invented by [[Paul Uhlenhuth]] in 1901 and could distinguish human [[blood]] from animal blood, based on the discovery that the blood of different species had one or more characteristic proteins. The test represented a major breakthrough and came to have tremendous importance in forensic science.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurland, ''Irrefutable Evidence: A History of Forensic Science'' (p. 200), Dee, 2009, {{ISBN|9781461662396}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test was further refined for forensic use by the Swiss chemist [[Maurice Müller]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Inman, Norah Rudin, ''Principles and Practice of Criminalistics: The Profession of Forensic Science'' (p. 32), CRC Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA===
Forensic [[DNA profiling|DNA analysis]] was first used in 1984. It was developed by Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]], who realized that variation in the genetic code could be used to identify individuals and to tell individuals apart from one another. The first application of DNA profiles was used by Jefferys in a double murder mystery in the small English town of [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1985. A 15-year-old school girl by the name of Lynda Mann was raped and murdered in Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital. The police did not find a suspect but were able to obtain a semen sample.

In 1986, Dawn Ashworth, 15 years old, was also raped and strangled in the nearby village of [[Enderby, Leicestershire|Enderby]]. Forensic evidence showed that both killers had the same blood type. Richard Buckland became the suspect because he worked at Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital, had been spotted near Dawn Ashworth's murder scene and knew unreleased details about the body. He later confessed to Dawn's murder but not Lynda's.  Jefferys was brought into the case to analyze the semen samples. He concluded that there was no match between the samples and Buckland, who became the first person to be exonerated using DNA. Jefferys confirmed that the DNA profiles were identical for the two murder semen samples. To find the perpetrator, DNA samples from the entire male population, more than 4,000 aged from 17 to 34, of the town were collected. They all were compared to semen samples from the crime.  A friend of [[Colin Pitchfork]] was heard saying that he had given his sample to the police claiming to be Colin. Colin Pitchfork was arrested in 1987 and it was found that his DNA profile matched the semen samples from the murder.

Because of this case, DNA databases were developed. There is the national (FBI) and international databases as well as the European countries (ENFSI : European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). These searchable databases are used to match crime scene DNA profiles to those already in a database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploreforensics.co.uk/forensic-cases-colin-pitchfork-first-exoneration-through-dna.html|title=Forensic Cases: Colin Pitchfork, First Exoneration Through DNA|website=exploreforensics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the turn of the 20th century, the science of forensics had become largely established in the sphere of criminal investigation. Scientific and surgical investigation was widely employed by the [[Metropolitan Police]] during their pursuit of the mysterious [[Jack the Ripper]], who had killed a number of [[prostitute]]s in the 1880s. This case is a watershed in the application of forensic science. Large teams of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries throughout Whitechapel. Forensic material was collected and examined. Suspects were identified, traced and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry. Police work follows the same pattern today.&lt;ref name=canter12&gt;[[David Canter|Canter, David]] (1994), ''Criminal Shadows: Inside the Mind of the Serial Killer'', London: HarperCollins, pp. 12–13, {{ISBN|0-00-255215-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2000 people were interviewed, &quot;upwards of 300&quot; people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.&lt;ref&gt;Inspector [[Donald Swanson]]'s report to the Home Office, {{Nowrap|19 October}} 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 205; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 113; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation was initially conducted by the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID), headed by Detective Inspector [[Edmund Reid]]. Later, Detective Inspectors [[Frederick Abberline]], [[Henry Moore (police officer)|Henry Moore]], and [[Walter Simon Andrews|Walter Andrews]] were sent from Central Office at [[Scotland Yard]] to assist. Initially, butchers, surgeons and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations. The alibis of local butchers and slaughterers were investigated, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Inspector Donald Swanson's report to the [[Home Office]], {{Nowrap|19 October}} 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 206 and Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary figures thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the [[London Docks]],&lt;ref&gt;Marriott, John, &quot;The Imaginative Geography of the Whitechapel murders&quot;, in Werner, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, p. 93; ''The Daily Telegraph'', {{Nowrap|10 November}} 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; The cattle boats were examined, but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements, and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Anderson to Home Office, {{Nowrap|10 January}} 1889, 144/221/A49301C ff. 235–236, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October, Robert Anderson asked police surgeon [[Thomas Bond (British physician)|Thomas Bond]] to give his opinion on the extent of the murderer's surgical skill and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 186–187; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 359–360&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion offered by Bond on the character of the &quot;Whitechapel murderer&quot; is the earliest surviving [[Offender profiling|offender profile]].&lt;ref name=canter5&gt;Canter, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; Bond's assessment was based on his own examination of the most extensively mutilated victim and the [[Autopsy|post mortem]] notes from the four previous canonical murders.&lt;ref name=bond&gt;Letter from Thomas Bond to Robert Anderson, {{Nowrap|10 November}} 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 360–362 and Rumbelow, pp. 145–147&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to &quot;periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic [[mania]]&quot;, with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating &quot;[[satyriasis]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=bond/&gt; Bond also stated that &quot;the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease but I do not think either hypothesis is likely&quot;.&lt;ref name=bond/&gt;

[[File:The Adventure of the Abbey Grange 03.jpg|thumb|left|The popular fictional character [[Sherlock Holmes]] was in many ways ahead of his time in his use of forensic analysis.]]
''Handbook for Coroners, police officials, military policemen'' was written by the [[Austrians|Austrian]] criminal jurist [[Hans Gross]] in 1893, and is generally acknowledged as the birth of the field of criminalistics. The work combined in one system fields of knowledge that had not been previously integrated, such as psychology and physical science, and which could be successfully used against crime. Gross adapted some fields to the needs of criminal investigation, such as [[crime scene photography]]. He went on to found the Institute of Criminalistics in 1912, as part of the University of Graz' Law School. This Institute was followed by many similar institutes all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Martin|title=Otto Gross, Freudian Psychoanalyst, 1877–1920|publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press]]|year=1999|location=Lampeter|isbn=0-7734-8164-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Archibald Reiss]] founded the ''Institut de police scientifique'' of the [[University of Lausanne|University of Lausanne (UNIL)]], the first school of forensic science in the world. Dr. [[Edmond Locard]], became known as the &quot;[[Sherlock Holmes]] of [[France]]&quot;. He formulated the basic principle of forensic science: &quot;Every contact leaves a trace&quot;, which became known as [[Locard's exchange principle]]. In 1910, he founded what may have been the first criminal laboratory in the world, after persuading the Police Department of [[Lyon]] (France) to give him two attic rooms and two assistants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3210/3210lect02.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206090107/http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3210/3210lect02.htm|date=6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic of the new found prestige of forensics and the use of reasoning in detective work was the popularity of the fictional character [[Sherlock Holmes]], written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in the late 19th century. He remains a great inspiration for forensic science, especially for the way his acute study of a crime scene yielded small clues as to the precise sequence of events. He made great use of [[trace evidence]] such as shoe and tire impressions, as well as fingerprints, [[ballistics]] and [[Graphology|handwriting analysis]], now known as [[questioned document examination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMDWLq2FdrIC|title=Oxford studies in epistemology|editor=Tamar Szabo Gendler |editor2=John Hawthorne|author=Alexander Bird |chapter=Abductive Knowledge and Holmesian Inference |page=11 |isbn=978-0-19-928590-7 |date=27 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such evidence is used to test theories conceived by the police, for example, or by the investigator himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia Sherlockiana |author=Matthew Bunson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSgfAQAAIAAJ |page=50 |isbn=978-0-671-79826-0 |date=19 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the techniques advocated by Holmes later became reality, but were generally in their infancy at the time Conan Doyle was writing. In many of his reported cases, Holmes frequently complains of the way the crime scene has been contaminated by others, especially by the police, emphasising the critical importance of maintaining its integrity, a now well-known feature of crime scene examination. He used [[analytical chemistry]] for [[blood residue]] analysis as well as [[toxicology]] examination and determination for poisons. He used [[ballistics]] by measuring bullet [[caliber|calibres]] and matching them with a suspected murder weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fact and feeling: Baconian science and the nineteenth-Century literary imagination |page=214 |author=Jonathan Smith |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFn1Zx_desIC |isbn=978-0-299-14354-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late 19th – early 20th centuries figures ===
Hans Gross applied scientific methods to crime scenes and was responsible for the birth of criminalistics.

Edmund Locard expanded on Gross' work with Locard's Exchange Principle which stated &quot;whenever two objects come into contact with one another, materials are exchanged between them&quot;. This means that every contact by a criminal leaves a trace. 

Alexander Lacassagne, who taught Locard, produced autopsy standards on actual forensic cases.

Alphonse Bertillon was a French criminologist and founder of Anthropometry (scientific study of measurements and proportions of the human body). He used anthropometry for identification, stating that, since each individual is unique, by measuring aspects of physical difference there could be a personal identification system. He created the Bertillon System around 1879, a way of identifying criminals and citizens by measuring 20 parts of the body. In 1884, over 240 repeat offenders were caught using the Bertillon system, but the system was largely superseded by fingerprinting.

Frances Glessner Lee, known as &quot;the mother of forensic science&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/nutshells | title=Murder is Her Hobby: Frances Glessner Lee and the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death}}&lt;/ref&gt; was instrumental in the development of forensic science in the US. She lobbied to have coroners replaced by medical professionals, endowed the Harvard Associates in Police Science, and conducted many seminars to educate homicide investigators. She also created the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, intricate crime scene dioramas used to train investigators, which are still in use today.

===20th century===
[[File:Alec Jeffreys -2008.jpg|thumb|[[Alec Jeffreys]] invented the [[DNA profiling]] technique in 1984.]]
Later in the 20th century several British pathologists, [[Mikey Rochman]], [[Francis Camps]], [[Sydney Smith (forensic expert)|Sydney Smith]] and [[Keith Simpson (professor)|Keith Simpson]] pioneered new forensic science methods. [[Alec Jeffreys]] pioneered the use of [[DNA profiling]] in forensic science in 1984. He realized the scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the [[genetic code]] to identify individuals. The method has since become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes.&lt;ref name=&quot;welcome 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |title=Discovering DNA fingerprinting: Sir Alec Jeffreys describes its development |publisher=[[Wellcome Trust]] |date=4 February 2004 |first=Giles |last=Newton |accessdate=23 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135415/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |archivedate=5 March 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA fingerprinting was first used as a police forensic test to identify the rapist and killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who were both murdered in [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1983 and 1986 respectively. [[Colin Pitchfork]] was identified and convicted of murder after samples taken from him matched [[semen]] samples taken from the two dead girls.

Forensic science has been fostered by a number of national and international forensic science learned bodies including the [[Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csofs.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609094436/http://www.csofs.org/|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 1959), then known as the Forensic Science Society, publisher of ''[[Science &amp; Justice]]'';.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csofs.org/publications |title=Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences Publications |accessdate=2016-06-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615161534/http://www.csofs.org/Publications |archivedate=15 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Academy of Forensic Sciences]] (founded 1948), publishers of the ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafs.org/journal-forensic-sciences ''Journal of Forensic Sciences''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123140138/http://www.aafs.org/journal-forensic-sciences |date=23 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Canadian Society of Forensic Science]] (founded 1953), publishers of the ''[[Journal of the Canadian Society of Forensic Science]]''; the British Academy of Forensic Sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/|title=The British Academy of Forensic Sciences|accessdate=26 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627092734/http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/|archivedate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 1960), publishers of ''[[Medicine, Science and the Law]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/journal|title=Medicine, Science and the Law|accessdate=26 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627111139/http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/journal|archivedate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences]] (founded 1967), publishers of the ''Australian Journal of Forensic Sciences'', and the [[European Network of Forensic Science Institutes]] (founded 1995).

=== 21st century ===
In the past decade, documenting forensics scenes has become more efficient. Forensic scientists have started using laser scanners, drones and photogrammetry to obtain 3D point clouds of accidents or crime scenes. Reconstruction of an accident scene on a highway using drones involves data acquisition time of only 10–20 minutes and can be performed without shutting down traffic. The results are not just accurate, in centimeters, for measurement to be presented in court but also easy to digitally preserve in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.isasi.org/Documents/Hawkins%20-%20Using%20a%20drone%20and%20photogrammetry%20software%20V4%20(PAPER).pdf|title=Using a Drone and Photogrammetry Software to Create Orthomosaic Images and 3D Models of Aircraft Accident Sites|last=Hawkins|first=Stuart|date=November 2016|work=UK AAIB|access-date=4 February 2017|via=International Society of Air Safety Investigators|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113120441/http://www.isasi.org/Documents/Hawkins%20-%20Using%20a%20drone%20and%20photogrammetry%20software%20V4%20(PAPER).pdf|archivedate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Now, in the 21st century, much of forensic science's future is up for discussion. The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) has offered the community some guidelines upon which the science should build. NIST recommends that forensic science rethinks its system. If local laboratories abide by these guidelines, 21st century forensics will be dramatically different from what it has been up till now. One of the more recent additions by NIST is a document called NISTIR-7941, titled &quot;Forensic Science Laboratories: Handbook for Facility Planning, Design, Construction, and Relocation&quot;. The handbook provides a clear blueprint for approaching Forensic Science. The details even include what type of staff should be hired for certain positions.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;National Institute of Standards and Technology&quot; group=&quot;Scientist in Practice&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Aguilar |first1=James |title=Forensic Science Laboratories: Handbook for Facility Planning, Design, Construction, and Relocation |url=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2013/NIST.IR.7941.pdf |website=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2013/NIST.IR.7941.pdf |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate=15 April 2019 |ref=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Questionable techniques ==
Some forensic techniques, believed to be scientifically sound at the time they were used, have turned out later to have much less scientific merit or none.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Annual Review of Law and Social Science |volume=4 |pages=149–171 |doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172303 |first1=Michael J. |last1=Saks |first2=David L. |last2=Faigman |year=2008 |title= Failed forensics: how forensic science lost its way and how it might yet find it|url=https://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2312&amp;context=faculty_scholarship }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some such techniques include:
* [[Comparative bullet-lead analysis]] was used by the FBI for over four decades, starting with the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] in 1963.

== Litigation science ==
'''Litigation science''' describes analysis or data developed or produced ''expressly'' for use in a trial versus those produced in the course of independent research. This distinction was made by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] when evaluating the admissibility of experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Media impact==
Real-life crime scene investigators and forensic scientists warn that popular television shows do not give a realistic picture of the work, often wildly distorting its nature, and exaggerating the ease, speed, effectiveness, drama, glamour, influence and comfort level of their jobs—which they describe as far more mundane, tedious and boring.&lt;ref name=&quot;how_accurate_are_crime_shows_2017_02_07_rasumssen_edu&quot;&gt;Flavin, Brianna (quoting Brian McKenna, retired police Lieutenant and Crime Scene Investigator), [http://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/justice-studies/blog/crime-show-myths-debunked-forensic-experts-tell-what-life-is-real/ &quot;How Accurate are Crime Shows on TV?

Further, research has suggested that public misperceptions about criminal forensics can create, in the mind of a [[juror]], unrealistic expectations of forensic evidence—which they expect to see before convicting—implicitly biasing the juror towards the defendant. Citing the &quot;CSI Effect,&quot; at least one researcher has suggested screening jurors for their level of influence from such TV programs&lt;ref name=&quot;csi_effect_and_juror_decisions_2015_alldredge&quot; /&gt;

==Controversies==
Questions about certain areas of forensic science, such as fingerprint evidence and the assumptions behind these disciplines have been brought to light in some publications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=18 February 2009| title='Badly Fragmented' Forensic Science System Needs Overhaul| publisher=The National Academies| url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12589| accessdate=2009-03-09| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826234749/http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12589| archivedate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=18 February 2009| title=National Academy of Sciences Finds 'Serious Deficiencies' in Nation's Crime Labs| publisher=National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers| url=http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/newsreleases/2009mn06?OpenDocument| accessdate=2009-03-07| website=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305013129/http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/newsreleases/2009mn06?OpenDocument| archive-date=5 March 2010| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the ''New York Post''.&lt;ref name=ForensicChallenge&gt;{{cite web| date=6 March 2009| title=CSI: Without a clue; A new report forces Police and Judges to rethink forensic science| author=Katherine Ramsland| work=[[The New York Post]], PostScript| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03072009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/csi__without_a_clue_158464.htm| accessdate=2009-03-07| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310062628/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03072009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/csi__without_a_clue_158464.htm| archivedate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that &quot;No one has proved even the basic assumption: That everyone's fingerprint is unique.&quot;&lt;ref name=ForensicChallenge /&gt; The article also stated that &quot;Now such assumptions are being questioned—and with it may come a radical change in how forensic science is used by police departments and prosecutors.&quot;&lt;ref name=ForensicChallenge /&gt; Law professor Jessica Gabel said on NOVA that forensic science &quot;lacks the rigors, the standards, the quality controls and procedures that we find, usually, in science.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Gabel, lawyer and lecturer from NOVA [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/forensics-on-trial.html &quot;Forensics on Trial&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627214550/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/forensics-on-trial.html |date=27 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, on 25 June 2009, the Supreme Court issued a 5-to-4 decision in ''[[Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts]]'' stating that crime laboratory reports may not be used against criminal defendants at trial unless the analysts responsible for creating them give testimony and subject themselves to cross-examination.  The Supreme Court cited the National Academies report ''Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12589 |title=Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward |publisher=Nap.edu |accessdate=2010-06-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527111020/http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12589 |archivedate=27 May 2010 |doi=10.17226/12589 |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-309-13130-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their decision. Writing for the majority, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] referred to the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report in his assertion that &quot;Forensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation.&quot;

In the US, another area of forensic science that has come under question in recent years is the lack of laws requiring the accreditation of forensic labs.  Some states require accreditation, but some states do not.  Because of this, many labs have been caught performing very poor work resulting in false convictions or acquittals.  For example, it was discovered after an audit of the Houston Police Department in 2002 that the lab had fabricated evidence which led George Rodriguez being convicted of raping a fourteen-year-old girl.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/us/new-doubt-cast-on-testing-in-houston-police-crime-lab.html|title = New Doubt Cast on Testing in Houston Police Crime Lab|date = 5 August 2004|accessdate = 24 October 2014|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031000519/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/us/new-doubt-cast-on-testing-in-houston-police-crime-lab.html|archivedate = 31 October 2014|newspaper = The New York Times|last1 = Liptak|first1 = Adam|last2 = Blumenthal|first2 = Ralph}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former director of the lab, when asked, said that the total number of cases that could have been contaminated by improper work could be in the range of 5,000 to 10,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;  This could have been avoided if the lab had been accredited by organizations such as ASCLD/Lab, which require crime labs to undergo rigorous assessments to show that they are able to perform multiple tests accurately.  Once they become accredited, they are periodically re-evaluated to ensure that the lab is still functioning at its best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ascld-lab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Why-become-an-acredited-lab.pdf|title = Why become an Accredited Laboratory?|accessdate = 20 October 2014|website = American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors / Laboratory Accreditation Board|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141025053645/http://www.ascld-lab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Why-become-an-acredited-lab.pdf|archivedate = 25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Periodic evaluations of a lab's performance by an independent organization will help to prevent scandals from occurring in forensic science laboratories.

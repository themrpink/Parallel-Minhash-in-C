In May 2017, Ireland began the process of introducing an &quot;opt-out&quot; system for organ donation. Minister for Health, Simon Harris, outlined his expectations to have the Human Tissue Bill passed by the end of 2017. This bill would put in place the system of &quot;presumed consent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/harris-planning-organ-donation-opt-out-system-1.3075447|title=Harris planning organ donation 'opt-out' system|work=The Irish Times|access-date=May 9, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mental Capacity Act is another legal policy in place for organ donation in the UK. The act is used by medical professionals to declare a patient's mental capacity. The act claims that medical professionals are to &quot;act in a patient's best interest&quot;, when the patient is unable to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

India has a fairly well developed corneal donation programme; however, donation after brain death has been relatively slow to take off. Most of the transplants done in India are living related or unrelated transplants. To curb organ commerce and promote donation after brain death the government enacted a law called &quot;[[Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994|The Transplantation of Human Organs Act]]&quot; in 1994 that brought about a significant change in the organ donation and transplantation scene in India.

In the year 2000 through the efforts of an NGO called [[MOHAN Foundation]] state of [[Tamil Nadu]] started an organ sharing network between a few hospitals.&lt;ref name=&quot;kannan200201&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Kannan, Ramya | work=[[The Hindu]] | url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2002/01/22/stories/2002012203130300.htm | title=Organ donation gains momentum | date=January 22, 2002 | access-date=March 8, 2014 | location=India | department=Southern States | url-status=live | archive-date=March 8, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308233702/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2002/01/22/stories/2002012203130300.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kannan200302&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/02/28/stories/2003022809430100.htm | title=High time to streamline organ transplants | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=February 28, 2003 | access-date=March 8, 2014 | author=Kannan, Ramya | location=India | department=Southern States | url-status=live | archive-date=December 13, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213165119/http://www.hindu.com/2003/02/28/stories/2003022809430100.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This NGO also set up similar sharing network in the state of Andhra Pradesh and these two states were at the forefront of deceased donation and transplantation programme for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;raman200207&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/25/stories/2002072501030100.htm |title=Living after death |work=[[The Hindu]] |department=Metro Plus Hyderabad |date=July 25, 2002 |access-date=March 8, 2014 |author=Raman, Usha |location=India |url-status=live |archive-date=November 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129141301/http://hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/25/stories/2002072501030100.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;joseph200401&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Organ-transplantation-help-at-hand/articleshow/447835.cms | title=Organ transplantation help at hand | work=[[The Times of India]] | date=January 28, 2004 | author=Joseph, Lison | department=Hyderabad | url-status=live | archive-url=https://archive.is/20140308002221/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Organ-transplantation-help-at-hand/articleshow/447835.cms | archive-date=March 8, 2014 | access-date=October 31, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, retrieval of 1033 organs and tissues were facilitated in these two states by the NGO.&lt;ref name=&quot;mohaninosfigs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mohanfoundation.org/cadaveric-organ-donation-figures.asp?state=Andhra%20Pradesh | title=Cadaveric Organ Donation Figures | publisher=MOHAN Foundation | access-date=March 8, 2014 | at=INOS Figures (2000–2009) | url-status=dead | archive-date=January 2, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102231124/http://www.mohanfoundation.org/cadaveric-organ-donation-figures.asp?state=Andhra%20Pradesh }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar sharing networks came up in the states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Karnataka]]; however, the numbers of deceased donation happening in these states were not sufficient to make much impact. In 2008, the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] put together government orders laying down procedures and guidelines for deceased organ donation and transplantation in the state.&lt;ref name=mohan08&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mohanfoundation.org/organ-donation-transplant-resources/government-orders-organ-donation-%20transplantation-tamil-nadu.asp |title=Government Orders on Organ Donation and Transplantation From Tamil Nadu Health Department |publisher=MOHAN Foundation |access-date=March 8, 2014 |author=Navin, Sumana |year=2008 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211084152/http://www.mohanfoundation.org/organ-donation-transplant-resources/government-orders-organ-donation-%20transplantation-tamil-nadu.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; These brought in almost thirty hospitals in the programme and has resulted in significant increase in the donation rate in the state. With an organ donation rate of 1.15 per million population, Tamil Nadu is the leader in deceased organ donation in the country. The small success of Tamil Nadu model has been possible due to the coming together of both government and private hospitals, NGOs and the State Health department. Most of the deceased donation programmes have been developed in southern states of India.&lt;ref name=&quot;srinivasan2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f2155 | title=Has Tamil Nadu turned the tide on the transplant trade? | author=Srinivasan, Sandhya | journal=[[BMJ]] | year=2013 | volume=346 | pages=f2155 | doi=10.1136/bmj.f2155 | pmid=23585066| s2cid=31085086 }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various such programmes are as follows-

In the year 2012 besides Tamil Nadu other southern states too did deceased donation transplants more frequently. An online organ sharing registry for deceased donation and transplantation is used by the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Both these registries have been developed, implemented and maintained by [[MOHAN Foundation]]. However. National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) is a National level organization set up under Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and only official organization.

Organ selling is legally banned in Asia. Numerous studies have documented that organ vendors have a poor ''quality of life'' (QOL) following kidney donation. However, a study done by Vemuru reddy ''et al'' shows a significant improvement in Quality of life contrary to the earlier belief.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMC3114583&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Live related donors in India: Their quality of life using world health organization quality of life brief questionnaire | first1=Sunil K.

In India, there are six types of life saving organs that can be donated to save the life of a patient. These include Kidneys, Liver, Heart, Lungs, Pancreas and Intestine. Off late, uterus transplant has also been started in India. However, uterus is not a life saving organ as per the Transplantation of Human Organs Act (2011).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Health&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://thehealth.today/types-of-organ-donation-in-india/ | title=Types Of Organ Donation In India | work=[[The Health]] | date=March 24, 2019 | access-date=August 27, 2019 | author=Nitin | url-status=live | archive-date=August 25, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825182024/https://thehealth.today/types-of-organ-donation-in-india/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===

Only one country, Iran has eliminated the shortage of transplant organs – and only Iran has a working and legal payment system for organ donation. [54] It is also the only country where organ trade is legal. The way their system works is, if a patient does not have a living relative or who are not assigned an organ from a deceased donor, apply to the nonprofit Dialysis and Transplant Patients Association (Datpa). The association establishes potential donors, those donors are assessed by transplant doctors who are not affiliated with the Datpa association. The government gives a compensation of $1,200 to the donors and aid them a year of limited health-insurance. Additionally, working through Datpa, kidney recipients pay donors between $2,300 and $4,500.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Importantly, it is illegal for the medical and surgical teams involved or any ‘middleman’ to receive payment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Iranian Model of Paid and Regulated Living-Unrelated Kidney Donation|last1 = Ghods|first1 = Ahad J.|date = November 2006|journal = [[Clin.

The Iranian system began in 1988 and eliminated the shortage of kidneys by 1999. Within the first year of the establishment of this system, the number of transplants had almost doubled; nearly four fifths were from living unrelated sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;[55] Nobel Laureate economist [[Gary Becker]] and Julio Elias estimated that a payment of $15,000 for living donors would alleviate the shortage of kidneys in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Israel===

{{see also|Organ transplantation in Israel}}
Since 2008, signing an organ donor card in Israel has provided a potential medical benefit to the signer. If two patients require an organ donation and have the same medical need, preference will be given to the one that had signed an organ donation card. (This policy was nicknamed &quot;Don't give, don't get&quot;.) Organ donation in Israel increased after 2008.

===Japan===

{{see also|Organ transplantation in Japan}}

The rate of organ donation in Japan is significantly lower than in Western countries.&lt;ref name=Wicks&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/408769 | title=Brain Death and Transplantation: The Japanese | first=Mona Newsome |last=Wicks | journal=Medscape Transplantation | date=April 25, 2000 | access-date=March 8, 2014}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to cultural reasons, some distrust of [[western medicine]], and a controversial [[Organ transplantation in Japan|organ transplantation in 1968]] that provoked a ban on cadaveric organ donation that would last thirty years.&lt;ref name=Wicks/&gt; Organ donation in Japan is regulated by a 1997 organ transplant law, which defines &quot;[[brain death]]&quot; and legalized organ procurement from brain dead donors.

===New Zealand===

[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|Altruism]]
[[New Zealand]] law allows live donors to participate in [[Altruism|altruistic]] organ donation only. In the five years to 2018, there were 16 cases of liver donation by live donors and 381 cases of kidney donation by live donors.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.donor.co.nz/facts-and-myths/statistics/|title=Statistics|website=www.donor.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand has low rates of live donation, which could be due to the fact that it is illegal to pay someone for their organs. The Human Tissue Act 2008 states that trading in human tissue is prohibited, and is punishable by a fine of up to $50,000 or a prison term of up to 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human Tissue Act 2008|url = http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2008/0028/latest/DLM1154238.html|access-date=August 10, 2015 |publisher = New Zealand Legislature|date = July 1, 2013|id = Public Act 2008 No 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Compensation for Live Organ Donors Act 2016, which came into force in December 2017, allows live organ donors to be compensated for lost income for up to 12 weeks post-donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/hospitals-and-specialist-care/organ-donation-and-transplantation/compensation-live-organ-donors|title=Compensation for Live Organ Donors|website=Ministry of Health NZ|language=en|access-date=2019-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand law also allows for organ donation from deceased individuals. In the five years to 2018, organs were taken from 295 deceased individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Everyone who applies for a driver's licence in New Zealand indicates whether or not they wish to be a donor if they die in circumstances that would allow for donation.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZTA&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nzta.govt.nz/driver-licences/getting-a-licence/organ-and-tissue-donation/|title = Organ and tissue donation|website = Getting a license|publisher = NZ Transport Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question is required to be answered for the application to be processed, meaning that the individual must answer yes or no, and does not have the option of leaving it unanswered.&lt;ref name=NZTA /&gt; However, the answer given on the drivers license does not constitute [[informed consent]], because at the time of drivers license application not all individuals are equipped to make an informed decision regarding whether to be a donor, and it is therefore not the deciding factor in whether donation is carried out or not.&lt;ref name=NZTA /&gt; It is there to simply give indication of the person's wishes.&lt;ref name=NZTA /&gt; Family must agree to the procedure for donation to take place.&lt;ref name=NZTA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://njr.cdhb.health.nz/nephrology/kidney-donation.htm|title = Kidney Donation|date = October 2011|website = Nephrology Department, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand|publisher = Canterbury District Health Board |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129223137/http://njr.cdhb.health.nz/nephrology/kidney-donation.htm |archive-date=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 bill proposed setting up an organ donation register where people can give informed consent to organ donations and clearly state their legally binding wishes.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Parliament &quot;Human Tissue (Organ Donation) Amendment Bill&quot; http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL7223_1/human-tissue-organ-donation-amendment-bill&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bill did not pass, and there was condemnation of the bill from some doctors, who said that even if a person had given express consent for organ donation to take place, they would not carry out the procedure in the presence of any disagreement from grieving family members.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Herald. &quot;Doctors oppose organ donor bill&quot; http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10379728&lt;/ref&gt;

The indigenous population of New Zealand also have strong views regarding organ donation. Many [[Māori people|Maori]] people believe organ donation is morally unacceptable due to the cultural need for a dead body to remain fully intact.&lt;ref name=MOAL&gt;Mauri Ora Associates Limited. &quot;Māori Pacific Attitudes Towards Transplantation: Professional Perspectives&quot; https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/pages/maori-pacific-attitudes-towards-transplantation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, because there is not a universally recognised cultural authority, no one view on organ donation is universally accepted in the Maori population.&lt;ref name=MOAL /&gt; They are, however, less likely to accept a kidney transplant than other New Zealanders, despite being overrepresented in the population receiving dialysis.&lt;ref name=MOAL /&gt;

===Sri Lanka===

Organ donation in Sri Lanka was ratified by the Human Tissue Transplantation Act No. 48 of 1987. [[Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society]], a [[non-governmental organization]] established in 1961 has provided over 60,000 corneas for [[corneal transplantation]], for patients in 57 countries. It is one of the major suppliers of human eyes to the world, with a supply of approximately 3,000 corneas per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;associatedpr&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/01/23/sri-lanka-donates-eyes-to-world/ | title=Sri Lanka donates eyes to the world | agency=Associated Press | work=[[Foxnews.com]] | date=January 23, 2012 | access-date=March 9, 2014 | url-status=live | archive-date=January 23, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123131649/http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/01/23/sri-lanka-donates-eyes-to-world/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:NHS Organ Donor Card.png|thumb|NHS Organ Donor Card]]
Since 2015, Wales has had an opt-out organ donation register.

[[England]]'s [[Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Act 2019|Organ Donation Act]], also known as Max and Keira's law, came into effect in May 2020.

===United States===

Over 121,000 people in need of an organ are on the U.S. government waiting list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network|url=http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/data/|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|access-date=October 11, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013182114/http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/data/|archive-date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This crisis within the United States is growing rapidly because on average there are only 30,000 transplants performed each year.

In the past presumed consent was urged to try to decrease the need for organs. The [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]] of 1987 was adopted in several states, and allowed medical examiners to determine if organs and tissues of cadavers could be donated. By the 1980s, several states adopted different laws that allowed only certain tissues or organs to be retrieved and donated, some allowed all, and some did not allow any without consent of the family. In 2006 when the UAGA was revised, the idea of presumed consent was abandoned. In the United States today, organ donation is done only with consent of the family or donator themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~review/vol61n2/Orentlicher_v61n2.pdf|title = Presumed Consent to Organ Donation: Its Rise and Fall in the United States|last = Orentlicher|first = David|date = 2009|journal = [[Rutgers Law Rev.|Rutgers Law Review]]|author-link = David Orentlicher|volume = 61|issue = 2|pages = 295–331|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141114072505/http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~review/vol61n2/Orentlicher_v61n2.pdf|archive-date = November 14, 2014|df = mdy-all}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to economist Alex Tabarrok, the shortage of organs has increased the use of so-called expanded criteria organs, or organs that used to be considered unsuitable for transplant.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Five patients that received kidney transplants at the [[University of Maryland School of Medicine]] developed cancerous or benign tumors which had to be removed.

====Donor Leave Laws====

In addition to their sick and annual leave, federal executive agency employees are entitled to 30 days paid leave for organ donation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fed Organ Leave Law&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Bone Marrow or Organ Donor Leave|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/bone-marrow-or-organ-donor-leave/|website=Pay &amp; Leave: Leave Administration|publisher=United States Office of Personnel Management|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-two states (excluding only [[Alabama]], [[Connecticut]], [[Florida]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Michigan]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[Nevada]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota]], [[Tennessee]], [[Vermont]], and [[Wyoming]]) and the [[District of Columbia]] also offer paid leave for state employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leave Laws Fact Sheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Donor Leave Laws and Tax Deductions/Credits for Living Donors|url=https://www.kidney.org/sites/default/files/LDTaxDed_Leave.pdf|website=Donor Leave Laws and Tax Deductions/Credits for Living Donors|publisher=National Kidney Foundation|access-date=October 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011122058/https://www.kidney.org/sites/default/files/LDTaxDed_Leave.pdf|archive-date=October 11, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five states ([[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Louisiana]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Oregon]]) require certain private employers to provide paid leave for employees for organ or bone marrow donation, and seven others ([[Arkansas]], Connecticut, Maine, Nebraska, [[New York (state)|New York]], [[South Carolina]], and [[West Virginia]]) either require employers to provide unpaid leave, or encourage employers to provide leave, for organ or bone marrow donation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leave Laws Fact Sheet&quot; /&gt;

A bill in the US House of Representatives, the Living Donor Protection Act (introduced in 2016, then reintroduced in 2017&lt;ref name=LDP17&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.myast.org/living-donor-protection-act-2017-reintroduced| website= myast.org| publisher= American Society of Transplantation| title= The Living Donor Protection Act of 2017 Reintroduced| date= March 1, 2017| access-date= March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), would amend the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] to provide leave under the act for an organ donor.

====Tax incentives====

Nineteen US states and the [[District of Columbia]] provide tax incentives for organ donation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leave Laws Fact Sheet&quot; /&gt; The most generous state tax incentive is [[Utah]]'s tax credit, which covers up to $10,000 of unreimbursed expenses (travel, lodging, lost wages, and medical expenses) associated with organ or tissue donation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leave Laws Fact Sheet&quot; /&gt; [[Idaho]] (up to $5,000 of unreimbursed expenses) and [[Louisiana]] (up to $7,500 of 72% of unreimbursed expenses) also provide donor tax credits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leave Laws Fact Sheet&quot; /&gt; [[Arkansas]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Pennsylvania]] provide tax credits to employers for wages paid to employees on leave for organ donation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leave Laws Fact Sheet&quot; /&gt; Thirteen states ([[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Iowa]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Mississippi]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[North Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[Wisconsin]]) have a tax deduction for up to $10,000 of unreimbursed costs, and [[Kansas]] and [[Virginia]] offer a tax deduction for up to $5,000 of unreimbursed costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leave Laws Fact Sheet&quot; /&gt;

States have focused their tax incentives on unreimbursed costs associated with organ donation to ensure compliance with the [[National Organ Transplant Act of 1984]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larger Sacrifice&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molen|first1=M.

====Other financial incentives====

As stated above, under the [[National Organ Transplant Act of 1984]], granting monetary incentives for organ donation is illegal in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Organ Transplant Act&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=National Organ Transplant Act |publisher=US Code|ref=42 US Code 274e.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been some discussion about providing fixed payment for potential live donors. In 1988, regulated paid organ donation was instituted in [[Iran]] and, as a result, the renal transplant waiting list was eliminated. Critics of paid organ donation argue that the poor and vulnerable become susceptible to transplant tourism. Travel for transplantation becomes transplant tourism if the movement of organs, donors, recipients or transplant professionals occurs across borders and involves organ trafficking or transplant commercialism. Poor and underserved populations in underdeveloped countries are especially vulnerable to the negative consequences of transplant tourism because they have become a major source of organs for the 'transplant tourists' that can afford to travel and purchase organs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Br J Anaesth.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rudge |first1=C |last2=Matesanza |first2=R |last3=Delmonico |first3=F.L. |last4=Chapman |first4=J |title=International practices of organ donation|journal=Br J Anaesth |date=2012 |volume=108 |issue=1 |page=i48&lt;!--|pages=i55--&gt; |doi=10.1093/bja/aer399|pmid=22194431 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 a law was passed in Pennsylvania which proposed to pay $300 for room and board and $3,000 for funeral expenses to an organ donor's family. Developing the program was an eight-year process; it is the first of its kind.

The National Kidney Foundation has noted that financial incentives, such as this Pennsylvania statute, diminish human dignity.&lt;ref name=&quot;KidneyFoundOppose&quot; /&gt;

==Bioethical issues==

===Deontological===
[[File:Lung transplant rejection - high mag.jpg|thumb|Lung transplant rejection]]
Deontological issues are issues about whether a person has an ethical duty or responsibility to take an action. Nearly all scholars and societies around the world agree that voluntarily donating organs to sick people is ethically permissible. Although nearly all scholars encourage organ donation, fewer scholars believe that all people are ethically required to donate their organs after death. Similarly, nearly all religions support voluntary organ donation as a charitable act of great benefit to the community. Certain small faiths such as [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah Witnesses]] and [[Shinto]] are opposed to organ donation based upon religious teachings; for Jehovah Witnesses this opposition is absolute whereas there exists increasing flexibility amongst Shinto scholars. The [[Romani people|Roma People]], are also often opposed to organ donation based on prevailing spiritual beliefs and not religious views per se.&lt;ref name=easterbrookbeliefnet&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/2001/05/Organ-Donation-Where-Your-Religion-Stands.aspx?p=1 | work=[[BeliefNet]] |access-date=March 9, 2014 | title=Organ Donation: Where Your Religion Stands | last=Easterbrook | first=Gregg | url-status=live | archive-date=November 10, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110233120/http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/2001/05/Organ-Donation-Where-Your-Religion-Stands.aspx?p=1 | quote=Despite popular misconceptions, there are almost no religious rules against donating organs or receiving transplants. A few denominations ban these practices, and a few others have rules that are not models of clarity.}} ''This is the first of two pages.''&lt;/ref&gt; Issues surrounding [[patient autonomy]], [[living will]]s, and [[guardianship]] make it nearly impossible for involuntary organ donation to occur.

From the standpoint of [[deontological ethics]], the primary issues surrounding the morality of organ donation are semantic in nature. The debate over the definitions of [[life]], [[death]], [[human]], and [[Human body|body]] is ongoing. For example, whether or not a [[brain-dead]] patient ought to be kept artificially animate in order to preserve organs for donation is an ongoing problem in clinical [[bioethics]]. In addition, some have argued that organ donation constitutes an act of self-harm, even when an organ is donated willingly.

Further, the use of [[cloning]] to produce organs with a [[genotype]] identical to the recipient is a controversial topic, especially considering the possibility for an entire person to be brought into being for the express purpose of being destroyed for organ procurement. While the benefit of such a cloned organ would be a zero-percent chance of [[transplant rejection]], the ethical issues involved with creating and killing a clone may outweigh these benefits. However, it may be possible in the future to use cloned stem-cells to grow a new organ without creating a new human being.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

A relatively new field of transplantation has reinvigorated the debate. [[Xenotransplantation]], or the transfer of animal (usually pig) organs into human bodies, promises to eliminate many of the ethical issues, while creating many of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Organ Donation (Opposing Viewpoints)|publisher=Greenhaven Press|year=2013|isbn=9780737763324|editor-last=Egendorf|editor-first=Laura|location=Detroit|pages=[https://archive.org/details/organdonation0000unse/page/130 130–147]|url=https://archive.org/details/organdonation0000unse/page/130}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[xenotransplantation]] promises to increase the supply of organs considerably, the threat of organ [[transplant rejection]] and the risk of [[xenozoonosis]], coupled with general [[anathema]] to the idea, decreases the functionality of the technique. Some animal rights groups oppose the sacrifice of an animal for organ donation and have launched campaigns to ban them.&lt;ref&gt;Committee, O. X. T. E. I. (1996). ''Xenotransplantation : Science, ethics, and public policy''. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teleological===
On [[teleological]] or [[utilitarian]] grounds, the moral status of &quot;black market organ donation&quot; relies upon the ends, rather than the means.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} In so far as those who donate organs are often impoverished{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and those who can afford black market organs are typically well-off,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} it would appear that there is an imbalance in the trade. In many cases, those in need of organs are put on waiting lists for ''legal'' organs for indeterminate lengths of time — many die while still on a waiting list.

Organ donation is fast becoming an important [[bioethics|bioethical]] issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, the fact remains that demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a [[black market]] trend often referred to as ''transplant tourism.''{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice on the one hand and a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the [[organ trade]] should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not.&lt;ref name=Zargooshi2001&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zargooshi |first=Javaad | title=Quality of life of Iranian kidney &quot;donors&quot; | journal=[[J.

Opponents say that such a market would encourage criminals by making it easier for them to claim that their stolen organs were legal.

Legalization of the organ trade carries with it its own sense of justice as well.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Continuing black-market trade creates further disparity on the demand side: only the rich can afford such organs. Legalization of the international organ trade could lead to increased supply, lowering prices so that persons outside the wealthiest segments could afford such organs as well.

Exploitation arguments generally come from two main areas:
* ''Physical exploitation'' suggests that the operations in question are quite risky, and, taking place in third-world hospitals or &quot;back-alleys&quot;, even more risky. Yet, if the operations in question can be made safe, there is little threat to the donor.
* ''Financial exploitation'' suggests that the donor (especially in the [[India]]n subcontinent and [[Africa]]) are not paid enough. Commonly, accounts from persons who have sold organs in both legal and black market circumstances put the prices at between $150 and $5,000, depending on the local laws, supply of ready donors and scope of the transplant operation.&lt;ref name=Carney2007&gt;{{cite news | author=Carney, Scott | author-link=Scott Carney | url=https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/05/india_transplants_prices | title=Why a Kidney (Street Value: $3,000) Sells for $85,000 | date=May 8, 2007 | work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] | access-date=March 8, 2014 | url-status=live | archive-date=July 29, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729214639/http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/05/india_transplants_prices}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jan200611&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/12/AR2006111200375.html | work=[[The Washington Post]] | title=Poor Pakistanis Donate Kidneys for Money | first=Sadaqat | last=Jan | agency=Associated Press | date=November 12, 2006 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209011425/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/12/AR2006111200375.html | archive-date=February 9, 2013 | access-date=October 31, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc6090468&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/6090468.stm | work=BBC News |title=Iran's desperate kidney traders | date=October 31, 2006 | access-date=March 8, 2014 | first=Nima | last=Sarvestani | author-link=Nima Sarvestani | url-status=live | archive-date=November 13, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113071250/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/6090468.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chennai, India where one of the largest black markets for organs is known to exist, studies have placed the average sale price at little over $1,000.&lt;ref name=pmid12350189/&gt; Many accounts also exist of donors being postoperatively denied their promised pay.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |author=Carney, Scott | author-link=Scott Carney |url=https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/05/india_transplants_rani | title=Inside 'Kidneyville': Rani's Story | work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] | access-date=March 8, 2014 | date=May 8, 2007 | url-status=live | archive-date=June 23, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623192849/http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/05/india_transplants_rani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Cannibalism'' is a phrase coined by anthropologist [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]] in 1998 for an article written for The [[New Internationalist]]. Her argument was that the actual exploitation is an ethical failing, a human exploitation; a perception of the poor as organ sources which may be used to extend the lives of the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/biotech/organswatch/pages/cannibalism.html |title=The new cannibalism |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |work=Berkeley Digital Library SunSITE |author=Scheper-Hughes, Nancy |author-link=Nancy Scheper-Hughes |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503025108/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/biotech/organswatch/pages/cannibalism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic drivers leading to increased donation are not limited to areas such as India and Africa, but also are emerging in the United States. Increasing funeral expenses combined with decreasing real value of investments such as homes and retirement savings which took place in the 2000s have purportedly led to an increase in citizens taking advantage of arrangements where funeral costs are reduced or eliminated.&lt;ref name=stix2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Stix | first=Gary | date=January 4, 2011 | title=Donate Your Brain, Save a Buck | journal=[[Scientific American]] | volume=304 | issue=1 | page=29 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0111-29a| bibcode=2011SciAm.304a..29S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

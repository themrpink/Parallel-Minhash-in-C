==Breeding==
Breeding season for a mole depends on species, but is generally February through May. Males search for females by letting out high-pitched squeals and tunneling through foreign areas.

The gestation period of the Eastern (North America) mole (Scalopus aquaticus) is approximately 42 days. Three to five young are born, mainly in March and early April.&lt;ref name=icwdm_handbook&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icwdm.org/handbook/mammals/moles.asp |title=Moles their biology and control |publisher=Icwdm.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927225130/http://icwdm.org/handbook/mammals/moles.asp |archivedate=27 September 2013|access-date=12 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Townsend moles mate in February and March, and the 2–4 young are born in March and April after a gestation period of about 1 month.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=18061 ''Scapanus townsendii''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713023751/https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=18061 |date=13 July 2013 }}. California Department of Fish and Game&lt;/ref&gt; The Townsend mole is endangered in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;animalcontrolsolutions.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalcontrolsolutions.com/animals/coast-mole-control.html |title=Coast Mole Control and Trapping |publisher=Animalcontrolsolutions.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coast moles produce a litter of 2–5 pups between March and April.&lt;ref name=&quot;animalcontrolsolutions.com&quot;/&gt;

Pups leave the nest 30–45 days after birth to find territories of their own.

==Social structure==
Allegedly moles are solitary creatures, coming together only to mate. Territories may overlap, but moles avoid each other and males may fight fiercely if they meet.

==Classification==

[[File:Uropsilus1sm.jpg|thumb|''[[Uropsilus]]'']]
[[File:Scapanus latimanus2.jpg|thumb|[[Broad-footed mole]]]]
The family [[Talpidae]] contains all the true moles and some of their close relatives. Desmans, which are Talpidae but are not normally called &quot;moles&quot;, are not shown below, but belong to the subfamily Talpinae (note the slightly different name). Those species called &quot;[[shrew mole]]s&quot; represent an intermediate form between the moles and their shrew ancestors, and as such may not be fully described by the article.

On the other hand, there is no [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] relation between the mole and the [[hedgehog]], both of which were previously placed in the now-abandoned order [[Insectivora]]. As a result, [[Eulipotyphla]] (shrew-like animals, including moles), previously within Insectivora, has been elevated to the level of an order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Other &quot;moles&quot;==
While many groups of burrowing animals ([[pink fairy armadillo]]s, [[tuco-tuco]]s, [[mole rat]]s, [[mole cricket]]s, and [[mole crabs]]) have developed close physical similarities with moles due to [[convergent evolution]], two of these are so similar to true moles, they are commonly called and thought of as &quot;moles&quot; in common English, although they are completely unrelated to true moles or to each other. These are the [[golden mole]]s of southern Africa and the [[marsupial mole]]s of Australia. While difficult to distinguish from each other, they are most easily distinguished from true moles by shovel-like patches on their noses, which they use in tandem with their abbreviated forepaws to swim through sandy soils.

===Golden moles===
The golden moles belong to the same branch on the [[phylogenetic tree]] as the [[tenrec]]s, called [[Tenrecomorpha]], which, in turn, stem from a main branch of [[placental]] mammals called the [[Afrosoricida]]. This means that they share a closer common ancestor with such existing afrosoricids as [[elephant]]s, [[manatee]]s and [[aardvark]]s than they do with other placental mammals, such as true Talpidae moles.

===Marsupial moles===
[[File:Kret workowaty.jpg|thumb|A [[marsupial mole]]]]
As marsupials, these moles are even more distantly related to true talpid moles than golden moles are, both of which belong to the [[Eutheria]], or placental mammals. This means that they are more closely related to such existing Australian marsupials as [[kangaroo]]s or [[koala]]s, and even to a lesser extent to American marsupials, such as [[opossum]]s, than they are to placental mammals, such as golden or Talpidae moles.

==Interaction with humans==

===Pelts===
[[File:Debenham and Freebody ad 1921 1 ISaDN.jpg|thumb|Advertisement in ''[[Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News]]'', 1921]]
Moles' pelts have a velvety texture not found in surface animals. Surface-dwelling animals tend to have longer fur with a natural tendency for the [[nap (textile)|nap]] to lie in a particular direction, but to facilitate their burrowing lifestyle, mole pelts are short and very dense and have no particular direction to the nap. This makes it easy for moles to move backwards underground, as their fur is not &quot;brushed the wrong way&quot;. The leather is extremely soft and supple. [[Queen Alexandra]], the wife of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]], ordered a mole-fur garment to start a fashion that would create a demand for mole fur, thereby turning what had been a serious pest problem in [[Scotland]] into a lucrative industry for the country. Hundreds of pelts are cut into rectangles and sewn together to make a coat. The natural color is [[taupe]], (derived from the French noun ''taupe'' meaning mole) but it is readily dyed any color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furcommission.com/Biology/furtypes.html#anchor625647 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721235302/http://www.furcommission.com/Biology/furtypes.html#anchor625647 |archivedate=21 July 2011 |title=Furs types in brief |publisher=furcommission.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pest status - extermination and humane options===
[[File:Krtek1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Molehill]]s in eastern Bohemia]]
Moles are considered agricultural [[Pest (organism)|pests]] in some countries, while in others, such as [[Germany]], they are a [[protected species]], but may be killed with a [[Hunting license|permit]]. Problems cited as caused by moles include contamination of [[silage]] with soil particles, making it unpalatable to [[livestock]], the covering of pasture with fresh soil reducing its size and yield, damage to agricultural machinery by the exposure of stones, damage to young plants through disturbance of the soil, weed invasion of pasture through exposure of freshly tilled soil, and damage to drainage systems and watercourses. Other species such as [[weasel]]s and [[vole]]s may use mole tunnels to gain access to enclosed areas or plant roots.

Moles burrow and raise [[molehill]]s, killing parts of [[lawns]]. They can undermine plant roots, indirectly causing damage or death. Moles do not eat plant roots.&lt;ref name=&quot;extermine&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Op scherp staande mollenklem.jpg|thumb|A [[mole trap]]]]
Moles are controlled with traps such as [[mole-catcher]]s, smoke bombs, and poisons such as [[calcium carbide]], which produces [[acetylene]] gas to drive moles away. [[Strychnine]] was also used for this purpose in the past. The most common method now is Phostoxin or Talunex tablets. They contain [[aluminium phosphide]] and are inserted in the mole tunnels, where they turn into [[phosphine]] gas (not be confused with [[phosgene]] gas). More recently, high-grade [[nitrogen]] gas has proven effective at killing moles, with the added advantage of having no polluting effect to the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;extermine&quot; /&gt;

Other common defensive measures include cat litter and [[blood meal]], to repel the mole, or smoking its burrow. Devices are also sold to trap the mole in its burrow, when one sees the &quot;mole hill&quot; moving and therefore knows where the animal is, and then stabbing it.

Other humane options are also possible including humane traps that capture the mole alive so it may be transported elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;extermine&quot; /&gt; In many contexts including ordinary gardens, the damage caused by moles to lawns is mostly visual, and it is possible instead of extermination to simply remove the earth of the molehills as they appear, leaving their permanent galleries for the moles to continue their existence underground.&lt;ref name=&quot;extermine&quot; /&gt; However, when the tunnels are near the surface in soft ground or after heavy rain, they may collapse, leaving (small) unsightly furrows in the lawn.

===Meat===
[[William Buckland]], known for eating every animal he could, opined that mole meat tasted vile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why we need eccentricity |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/01/eccentricity-einstein-prince-society |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=13 May 2010 |first=Martin |last=Howard |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324015105/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/01/eccentricity-einstein-prince-society |archivedate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach''' (Wilhelmina Charlotte Caroline; 1 March 1683&amp;nbsp;– 20 November 1737&lt;ref name=dates/&gt;) was [[List of British royal consorts|Queen of Great Britain]] as the wife of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]].

Her father, [[John Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|Margrave John Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], belonged to a branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] and was the ruler of a small German state, the [[Principality of Ansbach]]. Caroline was orphaned at a young age and moved to the [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened]] court of her guardians, [[Frederick I of Prussia|King Frederick I]] and [[Queen Sophia Charlotte of Prussia]]. At the [[Prussian court]], her previously limited education was widened, and she adopted the liberal outlook possessed by Sophia Charlotte, who became her good friend and whose views influenced Caroline all her life.
 
As a young woman, Caroline was much sought-after as a bride. After rejecting the suit of the nominal King of Spain, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria]], she married George Augustus, the third-in-line to the [[British throne]] and [[heir apparent]] to the [[Electorate of Hanover]]. They had eight children, seven of whom grew to adulthood.

Caroline moved permanently to Britain in 1714 when her husband became [[Prince of Wales]]. As [[Princess of Wales]], she joined her husband in rallying political opposition to his father [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]. In 1717, her husband was expelled from court after a family row. Caroline came to be associated with [[Robert Walpole]], an opposition politician who was a former government minister. Walpole rejoined the government in 1720, and Caroline's husband and King George I reconciled publicly, on Walpole's advice. Over the next few years, Walpole rose to become the leading minister.

Caroline became queen and electress consort upon her husband's accession in 1727. Her eldest son, [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Frederick]], became Prince of Wales. He was a focus for the opposition, like his father before him, and Caroline's relationship with him was strained. As princess and as queen, Caroline was known for her political influence, which she exercised through and for Walpole. Her tenure included four regencies during her husband's stays in [[Hanover]], and she is credited with strengthening the [[House of Hanover]]'s place in Britain during a period of political instability. Caroline was widely mourned by her political allies following her death in 1737, as well as by the King, who refused to remarry.

==Early life==
[[File:De Merian Frankoniae 108.jpg|thumb|left|Ansbach in the 17th century]]
Caroline was born on 1 March 1683 at [[Ansbach]], the daughter of [[John Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], and his second wife, [[Princess Eleonore Erdmuthe of Saxe-Eisenach]].&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir, pp. 277–278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was the ruler of one of the smallest German states; he died of [[smallpox]] at the age of 32, when Caroline was three years old. Caroline and her only full sibling, her younger brother [[William Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|Margrave William Frederick]], left [[Ansbach]] with their mother, who returned to her native [[Eisenach]].&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1692, Caroline's widowed mother was pushed into an unhappy marriage with the [[John George IV, Elector of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], and she and her two children moved to the [[Saxon court]] at [[Dresden]]. Eleonore Erdmuthe was widowed again two years later, after her unfaithful husband contracted smallpox from his mistress.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, p. 6; Van der Kiste, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleonore remained in [[Saxony]] for another two years, until her death in 1696.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, p. 6; Hichens, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The orphaned Caroline and William Frederick returned to Ansbach to stay with their elder half-brother, [[George Frederick II, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|Margrave George Frederick II]]. George Frederick was a youth with little interest in parenting a girl, and so Caroline soon moved to [[Lützenburg]] outside [[Berlin]], where she entered into the care of her new guardians, [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg]], and his wife, [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover|Sophia Charlotte]], who had been a friend of Eleonore Erdmuthe.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Frederick and Sophia Charlotte became king and queen of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1701. The queen was the daughter of [[Sophia of Hanover|Dowager Electress Sophia of Hanover]], and the sister of [[George I of Great Britain|George, Elector of Hanover]]. She was renowned for her intelligence and strong character, and her uncensored and liberal court attracted a great many scholars, including philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]].&lt;ref name=H19&gt;Hichens, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline was exposed to a lively intellectual environment quite different from anything she had experienced previously. Before she began her education under Sophia Charlotte's care, Caroline had received little formal education; her handwriting remained poor throughout her life.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=vdk13&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; With her lively mind, Caroline developed into a scholar of considerable ability.&lt;ref name=H19/&gt; She and Sophia Charlotte developed a strong relationship in which Caroline was treated as a surrogate daughter;&lt;ref&gt;Hanham, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; the queen once declared Berlin was &quot;a desert&quot; without Caroline whenever she left temporarily for Ansbach.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=vdk13/&gt;

==Marriage==

An intelligent and attractive woman, Caroline was much sought-after as a bride. Dowager Electress Sophia called her &quot;the most agreeable Princess in Germany&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; She was considered for the hand of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria]], who was a candidate for the throne of Spain and later became Holy Roman Emperor. Charles made official overtures to her in 1703, and the match was encouraged by King Frederick of Prussia. After some consideration, Caroline refused in 1704, as she would not convert from [[Lutheranism]] to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, pp. 9–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the following year, Queen Sophia Charlotte died on a visit to her native Hanover.&lt;ref name=vdk14&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline was devastated, writing to Leibniz, &quot;The calamity has overwhelmed me with grief and sickness, and it is only the hope that I may soon follow her that consoles me.&quot;&lt;ref name=vdk14/&gt;

In June 1705, Queen Sophia Charlotte's nephew, [[George II of Great Britain|Prince George Augustus of Hanover]], visited the Ansbach court, supposedly incognito, to inspect Caroline, as his father the Elector did not want his son to enter into a loveless arranged marriage as he himself had.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, p. 18; Fryer ''et al''., p. 33; Hichens, p. 19; Van der Kiste, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The nephew of three childless uncles, George Augustus was under pressure to marry and father an heir to prevent endangering the Hanoverian succession.&lt;ref&gt;Hanham, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; He had heard reports of Caroline's &quot;incomparable beauty and mental attributes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hanoverian envoy Baron Philipp Adam von Eltz, quoted in Quennell, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately took a liking to her &quot;good character&quot; and the British envoy reported that George Augustus &quot;would not think of anybody else after her&quot;.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, p. 19; Van der Kiste, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; For her part, Caroline was not fooled by the prince's disguise, and found her suitor attractive.&lt;ref name=Fryer33&gt;Fryer ''et al''., p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the heir apparent of his father's [[Electorate of Hanover]] and third-in-line to the British throne of his distant cousin [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], after his grandmother Dowager Electress Sophia and his father the Elector.&lt;ref name=Fryer33/&gt;

On 22 August 1705, Caroline arrived in Hanover for her wedding to George Augustus; they were married that evening in the palace chapel at [[Herrenhausen]].&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; By May of the following year, Caroline was pregnant, and her first child [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Frederick]] was born on 20 January 1707.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after the birth, in July, Caroline fell seriously ill with [[smallpox]] followed by [[pneumonia]]. Her baby was kept away from her, but George Augustus remained at her side devotedly, and caught and survived the infection himself.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, pp. 38–39; Van der Kiste, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next seven years, Caroline had three more children, [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne]], [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Amelia]], and [[Princess Caroline of Great Britain|Caroline]], all of whom were born in Hanover.&lt;ref name=Fryer34&gt;Fryer ''et al''., p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henrietta Howard.jpg|thumb|[[Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk]] (pictured) was one of Caroline's [[Woman of the Bedchamber|Women of the Bedchamber]] in addition to being one of Caroline's husband's mistresses.]]

George Augustus and Caroline had a successful and loving marriage, though he continued to keep mistresses, as was customary for the time.&lt;ref name=H21&gt;Hichens, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline was well aware of his infidelities, as they were well known and he told her about them. His two best-known mistresses were [[Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk|Henrietta Howard, later Countess of Suffolk]], and, from 1735, [[Amalie von Wallmoden, Countess of Yarmouth]]. Howard was one of Caroline's [[Woman of the Bedchamber|Women of the Bedchamber]] and became [[Mistress of the Robes]] when her husband inherited a peerage in 1731; she retired in 1734.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, pp. 70, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with her [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle|mother-in-law]] and husband, Caroline was known for her marital fidelity; she never made any embarrassing scenes nor did she take lovers.&lt;ref name=H21/&gt; She preferred her husband's mistresses to be ladies-in-waiting, as that way she believed she could keep a closer eye on them.&lt;ref&gt;Fryer ''et al''., p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The succession of her husband's family to the British throne was still insecure, as Queen Anne's half-brother [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]] contested the Hanoverian claim, and Queen Anne and Caroline's grandmother-in-law Dowager Electress Sophia had fallen out. Anne refused permission for any of the Hanoverians to visit Britain in her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline wrote to Leibniz, &quot;I accept the comparison which you draw, though all too flattering, between me and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] as a good omen. Like Elizabeth, the Electress's rights are denied her by a jealous sister [Queen Anne], and she will never be sure of the English crown until her accession to the throne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1714, Dowager Electress Sophia died in Caroline's arms at the age of 83, and Caroline's father-in-law became [[heir presumptive]] to Queen Anne. Just weeks later, Anne died and the Elector of Hanover was proclaimed as her successor, becoming [[George I of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Princess of Wales==
[[File:Caroline Wilhelmina of Brandenburg-Ansbach by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|right|The Princess of Wales, painted by [[Godfrey Kneller|Sir Godfrey Kneller]] in 1716]]
George Augustus sailed to England in September 1714, and Caroline and two of her daughters followed in October.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, pp. 64–66; Van der Kiste, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Her journey across the [[North Sea]] from [[The Hague]] to [[Margate]] was the only sea voyage she took in her life.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, p. 67; Hanham, p. 285; Van der Kiste, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Their young son, Prince Frederick, remained in Hanover for the rest of [[George I of Great Britain|George I's]] reign to be brought up by private tutors.&lt;ref name=Fryer34/&gt;

On the accession of George I in 1714, Caroline's husband automatically became [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]]. Shortly afterwards, he was invested as [[Prince of Wales]], whereupon she became Princess of Wales. Caroline was the first woman to receive the title at the same time as her husband received his.&lt;ref name=Fryer33/&gt; She was the first Princess of Wales for over two hundred years, the last one being [[Catherine of Aragon]]. As George I had repudiated his wife [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle]] in 1694 prior to his becoming King of Great Britain, there was no [[queen consort]], and Caroline was the highest-ranking woman in the kingdom.&lt;ref name=Fryer34/&gt; George Augustus and Caroline made a concerted effort to &quot;anglicise&quot; by acquiring knowledge of England's language, people, politics and customs.&lt;ref&gt;Hanham, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Two separate courts developed with strong contrasts; the old king's had German courtiers and government ministers, while the Wales's court attracted English nobles out of favour with the King, and was considerably more popular with the British people. George Augustus and Caroline gradually became centres of the political opposition to the King.&lt;ref&gt;Fryer ''et al''., p. 34; Hanham, pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after their arrival in England, Caroline suffered a stillbirth, which her friend the Countess of Bückeburg blamed on the incompetence of English doctors,&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; but the following year she had another son, [[Prince George William of Great Britain|Prince George William]]. At the baptism in November 1717, her husband fell out with his father over the choice of godparents, leading to the couple's placement under house arrest at [[St. James's Palace]] prior to their banishment from court.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline was originally allowed to stay with their children, but refused as she believed her place was with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Hanham, p. 289; Hichens, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband moved into [[Leicester Square|Leicester House]], while their children remained in the care of the King.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, pp. 102–105; Van der Kiste, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline fell sick with worry, and fainted during a secret visit to her children made without the King's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; By January, the King had relented and allowed Caroline unrestricted access. In February, Prince George William fell ill, and the King allowed both George Augustus and Caroline to see him at [[Kensington Palace]] without any conditions. When the baby died, a post-mortem was conducted to prove that the cause of death was disease (a polyp on the heart) rather than the separation from his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Further tragedy occurred in 1718, when she miscarried at [[Richmond Lodge]], her country residence,&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, p. 112; Van der Kiste, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; after being startled by a violent storm.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, Caroline had three more children: [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|William]], [[Princess Mary of Great Britain|Mary]] and [[Louise of Great Britain|Louise]].&lt;ref&gt;Fryer ''et al''., p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1725, her 11th and final pregnancy ended in a second miscarriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennison2&quot;&gt;Dennison, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leicester House became a frequent meeting place for the ministry's political opponents. Caroline struck up a friendship with politician Sir [[Robert Walpole]], a former minister in the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] government who led a disgruntled faction of the party. In April 1720, Walpole's wing of the Whig party reconciled with the governing wing, and Walpole and Caroline helped to effect a reconciliation between the King and her husband for the sake of public unity.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quennell, pp. 79–81; Van der Kiste, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline wanted to regain her three eldest daughters, who remained in the care of the King, and thought the reconciliation would lead to their return, but negotiations came to nothing. George Augustus came to believe that Walpole had tricked him into the reconciliation as part of a scheme to gain power. The prince was isolated politically when Walpole's Whigs joined the government,&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt; and Leicester House played host to literary figures and wits, such as [[John Arbuthnot]] and [[Jonathan Swift]], rather than politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, pp. 135–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Arbuthnot told Swift that Caroline had enjoyed his ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', particularly the tale of the crown prince who wore one high-heel and one low-heel in a country where the King and his party wore low heels, and the opposition wore high ones: a barely veiled reference to the political leanings of the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, p. 136; Van der Kiste, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caroline's intellect far outstripped her husband's, and she read avidly. She established an extensive library at St. James's Palace. As a young woman, she corresponded with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], the intellectual colossus who was courtier and factotum to the House of Hanover. She later facilitated the [[Leibniz-Clarke correspondence]], arguably the most important philosophy of physics discussion of the 18th century. She helped to popularise the practice of [[variolation]] (an early type of [[immunisation]]), which had been witnessed by [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] and [[Charles Maitland (surgeon)|Charles Maitland]] in [[Constantinople]]. At the direction of Caroline, six condemned prisoners were offered the chance to undergo variolation instead of execution: they all survived, as did six orphan children given the same treatment as a further test. Convinced of its medical value, Caroline had her children Amelia, Caroline and Frederick inoculated against smallpox in the same manner.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, pp. 133–135; Van der Kiste, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In praising her support for smallpox inoculation, [[Voltaire]] wrote of her, &quot;I must say that despite all her titles and crowns, this princess was born to encourage the arts and the well-being of mankind; even on the throne she is a benevolent philosopher; and she has never lost an opportunity to learn or to manifest her generosity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire's &quot;Eleventh Letter: On Smallpox Inoculation&quot; in ''Philosophical Letters, Or Letters Regarding the English Nation'' (1733/4).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important archaeological discoveries in Sumer are a large number of [[clay tablet]]s written in [[cuneiform script]]. Sumerian writing is considered to be a great milestone in the development of humanity's ability to not only create historical records but also in creating pieces of literature, both in the form of poetic epics and stories as well as prayers and laws. 

Although pictures—that is, [[hieroglyphs]]—were used first, cuneiform and then ideograms (where symbols were made to represent ideas) soon followed. 

Triangular or wedge-shaped reeds were used to write on moist clay. A large body of hundreds of thousands of texts in the [[Sumerian language]] have survived, including personal and business letters, receipts, [[lexical lists]], laws, hymns, prayers, stories, and daily records. Full libraries of [[clay tablet]]s have been found. Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects, like statues or bricks, are also very common. Many texts survive in multiple copies because they were repeatedly transcribed by scribes in training. Sumerian continued to be the language of religion and law in Mesopotamia long after [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic speakers]] had become dominant.

A prime example of cuneiform writing would be a lengthy poem that was discovered in the ruins of [[Uruk]]. ''[[The Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' was written in the standard Sumerian cuneiform. It tells of a king from the early Dynastic II period named [[Gilgamesh]] or &quot;Bilgamesh&quot; in Sumerian. The story relates the fictional adventures of Gilgamesh and his companion, [[Enkidu]]. It was laid out on several clay tablets and is thought to be the earliest known surviving example of fictional literature.

The Sumerian language is generally regarded as a [[language isolate]] in [[linguistics]] because it belongs to no known language family; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], by contrast, belongs to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic branch]] of the [[Afroasiatic languages]]. There have been many failed attempts to connect Sumerian to other [[language family|language families]]. It is an [[agglutinative language]]; in other words, [[morpheme]]s (&quot;units of meaning&quot;) are added together to create words, unlike [[analytic languages]] where morphemes are purely added together to create sentences. Some authors have proposed that there may be evidence of a [[substratum]] or adstratum language for geographic features and various crafts and agricultural activities, called variously [[Proto-Euphratean]] or Proto Tigrean, but this is disputed by others.

Understanding Sumerian texts today can be problematic. Most difficult are the earliest texts, which in many cases do not give the full grammatical structure of the language and seem to have been used as an &quot;[[aide-mémoire]]&quot; for knowledgeable scribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics|last=Allan|first=Keith|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-164343-9|location=Oxford|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 3rd millennium BC, a cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread [[bilingualism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot;/&gt; The mutual influences between Sumerian on Akkadian are evident in all areas including lexical borrowing on a massive scale—and syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot;/&gt; These influences have prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian of the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[Sprachbund]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot;/&gt;

Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot;&gt;Woods C. 2006 [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf “Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian”].

The Sumerians credited their divinities for all matters pertaining to them and exhibited humility in the face of cosmic forces, such as [[death]] and [[divine wrath]].&lt;ref name=Kramer1963/&gt;{{rp|3–4}}

Sumerian religion seems to have been founded upon two separate [[Cosmogeny|cosmogenic]] myths. The first saw creation as the result of a series of ''[[hieros gamos|hieroi gamoi]]'' or sacred marriages, involving the reconciliation of opposites, postulated as a coming together of male and female divine beings, the gods. 

This pattern continued to influence regional Mesopotamian myths. Thus, in the later Akkadian [[Enuma Elish]], creation was seen as the union of fresh and salt water, between male [[Abzu]], and female [[Tiamat]]. The products of that union, [[Lahm]] and Lahmu, &quot;the muddy ones&quot;, were titles given to the gate keepers of the E-Abzu temple of [[Enki]] in Eridu, the first Sumerian city. 

Mirroring the way that muddy islands emerge from the confluence of fresh and salty water at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the river deposits its load of silt, a second hieros gamos supposedly resulted in the creation of Anshar and Kishar, the &quot;sky-pivot&quot; (or axle), and the &quot;earth pivot&quot;, parents in turn of [[Anu]] (the sky) and [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]] (the earth). 

Another important Sumerian hieros gamos was that between Ki, here known as [[Ninhursag]] or &quot;Lady of the Mountains&quot;, and [[Enki]] of Eridu, the god of fresh water which brought forth greenery and pasture.

At an early stage, following the dawn of recorded history, [[Nippur]], in central Mesopotamia, replaced [[Eridu]] in the south as the primary temple city, whose priests exercised political [[hegemony]] on the other city-states. Nippur retained this status throughout the Sumerian period.

====Deities====
[[File:Ea (Babilonian) - EnKi (Sumerian).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Akkadian [[cylinder seal]] from sometime around 2300 BC or thereabouts depicting the deities [[Inanna]], [[Utu]], [[Enki]], and [[Isimud]].]]
Sumerians believed in an anthropomorphic polytheism, or the belief in many gods in human form. There was no common set of gods; each city-state had its own patrons, temples, and priest-kings. Nonetheless, these were not exclusive; the gods of one city were often acknowledged elsewhere. Sumerian speakers were among the earliest people to record their beliefs in writing, and were a major inspiration in later [[Mesopotamian mythology]], [[religion]], and [[astrology]].

The Sumerians worshiped:
* [[Anu|An]] as the full-time god equivalent to heaven; indeed, the word ''an'' in Sumerian means sky and his consort [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]], means earth.
* [[Enki]] in the south at the temple in Eridu. Enki was the god of beneficence and of wisdom, ruler of the freshwater depths beneath the earth, a healer and friend to humanity who in Sumerian myth was thought to have given humans the arts and sciences, the industries and manners of civilization; the first law book was considered his creation.
* [[Enlil]] was the god of storm, wind, and rain.&lt;ref name=ColemanDavidson2015&gt;{{citation|last1=Coleman|first1=J.A.|last2=Davidson|first2=George|title=The Dictionary of Mythology: An A–Z of Themes, Legends, and Heroes|date=2015|publisher=Arcturus Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=978-1-78404-478-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108}} He was the chief god of the Sumerian pantheon&lt;ref name=ColemanDavidson2015 /&gt;{{rp|108}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Samuel Noah|last=Kramer|title=The Sumerian Deluge Myth: Reviewed and Revised|journal=Anatolian Studies|volume=33|date=1983|pages= 115–121|jstor=3642699|doi=10.2307/3642699}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115–121}} and the patron god of [[Nippur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hallo|first=William W.|article=Review: Enki and the Theology of Eridu|title=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=116|issue=2|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|231–234}} His consort was [[Ninlil]], the goddess of the south wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Black|first1=Jeremy A.|last2=Cunningham|first2=Graham|last3=Robson|first3=Eleanor|title=The Literature of Ancient Sumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1W2mTtGVV4C&amp;pg=PA106|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106}}

[[File:Genealogy of Sumero-Akkadian Gods.jpg|thumb|upright=2.05|left|Sumero-early Akkadian [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]]]

These [[deity|deities]] formed a core pantheon; there were additionally hundreds of minor ones. Sumerian gods could thus have associations with different cities, and their religious importance often waxed and waned with those cities' political power. The gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them. The temples organized the mass labour projects needed for irrigation agriculture. Citizens had a labor duty to the temple, though they could avoid it by a payment of silver.

====Cosmology====
Sumerians believed that the [[universe]] consisted of a flat disk enclosed by a [[dome]]. The Sumerian [[afterlife]] involved a descent into a gloomy [[Sumerian nether-world|netherworld]] to spend eternity in a wretched [[existence]] as a [[Gidim]] (ghost).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Black |first1=Jeremy |author-link1=Jeremy Black (assyriologist) |last2=Green | first2=Anthony |title= Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary |date=1992 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-70794-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe was divided into four quarters:
* To the north were the hill-dwelling [[Subartu]], who were periodically raided for slaves, timber, and other raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Whatever the assertions of cosmography here, when modern-day archaeologists carve out areas of exploration based on physical-remains and other data, there is an emphasis on three, ''vide'' Marcella Frangipane, &quot;Different Trajectories in State Formation in Greater Mesopotamia: A View from Arslantepe (Turkey)&quot;, ''Journal of Archaeological Research'' 26 (2018): 3–63.
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10814-017-9106-2: &quot;southern Mesopotamia, northern Mesopotamia, and [to the west] Upper Euphrates valley&quot; (3), with no reference to any of these proper-names.&lt;/ref&gt;
* To the west were the tent-dwelling [[Amorite|Martu]], [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] living as pastoral nomads tending herds of sheep and goats.
* To the south was the land of [[Dilmun]], a trading state associated with the land of the dead and the place of creation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carl Phillips 2013&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Bibby and Carl Phillips, ''Looking for Dilmun'' (London: Stacey International, 1996; reprinted London: Knopf, 2013). {{ISBN|978-0905743905}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To the east were the [[Elamites]], a rival people with whom the Sumerians were frequently at war.

Their known world extended from ''The Upper Sea'' or Mediterranean coastline, to ''The Lower Sea'', the [[Persian Gulf]] and the land of [[Meluhha]] (probably the [[Indus Valley]]) and [[Majan (civilization)|Magan]] ([[Oman]]), famed for its copper ores.

====Temple and temple organisation====
[[Ziggurat]]s (Sumerian temples) each had an individual name and consisted of a forecourt, with a central pond for purification.&lt;ref&gt;Leick, Gwendolyn (2003), Mesopotamia: The Invention of the City' (Penguin)&lt;/ref&gt; The temple itself had a central [[nave]] with aisles along either side. Flanking the aisles would be rooms for the priests. At one end would stand the [[podium]] and a [[mudbrick]] table for animal and vegetable [[sacrifice]]s. [[Granary|Granaries]] and [[Warehouse|storehouses]] were usually located near the temples. After a time the Sumerians began to place the temples on top of multi-layered square constructions built as a series of rising terraces, giving rise to the Ziggurat style.&lt;ref&gt;Mark M. Jarzombek and Vikramaditya Prakash, ''A Global History of Architecture'' (London: Wiley, 2011), 33–39. {{ISBN|978-0470902486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funerary practices====
It was believed that when people died, they would be confined to a gloomy world of [[Ereshkigal]], whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving. The dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse, along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food. Those who could afford it sought burial at [[Dilmun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carl Phillips 2013&quot;/&gt; [[Human sacrifice]] was found in the death pits at the [[Ur]] royal cemetery where Queen [[Puabi]] was accompanied in death by her servants.

===Agriculture and hunting===
The Sumerians adopted an agricultural lifestyle perhaps as early as c. 5000–4500 BC. The region demonstrated a number of core agricultural techniques, including organized [[irrigation]], large-scale intensive cultivation of land, [[mono-cropping]] involving the use of [[plough agriculture]], and the use of an agricultural [[Division of labour|specialized labour force]] under bureaucratic control. The necessity to manage temple accounts with this organization led to the development of [[history of writing|writing]] (c. 3500 BC).

[[File:Ur mosaic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|From the royal tombs of [[Ur]], made of [[lapis lazuli]] and shell, shows peacetime]]
In the early Sumerian Uruk period, the primitive pictograms suggest that [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, cattle, and [[pig]]s were domesticated. They used [[ox]]en as their primary beasts of burden and [[donkey]]s or [[equids]] as their primary transport animal and &quot;woollen clothing as well as rugs were made from the wool or hair of the animals. ... By the side of the house was an enclosed garden planted with trees and other plants; wheat and probably other cereals were sown in the fields, and the ''[[shaduf]]'' was already employed for the purpose of irrigation. Plants were also grown in pots or vases.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sayce&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Issue of barley rations.JPG|thumb|An account of barley rations issued monthly to adults and children written in [[cuneiform script]] on a clay tablet, written in year 4 of King [[Urukagina]], c. 2350 BC]]
The Sumerians were one of the first known [[beer]] drinking societies. Cereals were plentiful and were the key ingredient in their early brew. They brewed multiple kinds of beer consisting of wheat, barley, and mixed grain beers. Beer brewing was very important to the Sumerians. It was referenced in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] when [[Enkidu]] was introduced to the food and beer of Gilgamesh's people: &quot;Drink the beer, as is the custom of the land... He drank the beer-seven jugs! and became expansive and sang with joy!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|publisher=Gotham Books|isbn=978-1-59240-303-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/drinkculturalhis00gate_0/page/5 5]|year=2008|url=https://archive.org/details/drinkculturalhis00gate_0/page/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sumerians practiced similar irrigation techniques as those used in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mackenzie| first = Donald Alexander| year = 1927 | title = Footprints of Early Man| publisher = Blackie &amp; Son Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; American anthropologist [[Robert McCormick Adams]] says that irrigation development was associated with urbanization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Adams| first = R. McC.| year = 1981 | title = Heartland of Cities| publisher = University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that 89% of the population lived in the cities.

They grew [[barley]], [[chickpea]]s, [[lentil]]s, [[wheat]], [[Date (fruit)|dates]], [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[lettuce]], [[leek]]s and [[Mustard plant|mustard]]. Sumerians caught many fish and hunted [[fowl]] and [[gazelle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The fine art of food | first=Reay |last=Tannahill | publisher=Folio Society| year=1968}}{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumerian agriculture depended heavily on [[irrigation]]. The irrigation was accomplished by the use of ''[[shaduf]]'', [[canal]]s, [[Channel (geography)|channels]], [[dyke (construction)|dykes]], [[weir]]s, and [[reservoirs]]. The frequent violent floods of the [[Tigris]], and less so, of the [[Euphrates]], meant that canals required frequent repair and continual removal of [[silt]], and survey markers and boundary stones needed to be continually replaced. The government required individuals to work on the canals in a [[corvee]], although the rich were able to exempt themselves.

As is known from the &quot;''[[Sumerian Farmer's Almanac]]''&quot;, after the flood season and after the [[Spring equinox (northern hemisphere)|Spring equinox]] and the ''[[Akitu]]'' or New Year Festival, using the canals, farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water. Next they made oxen stomp the ground and kill weeds. They then dragged the fields with [[pickaxe]]s. After drying, they [[plowing|plowed]], [[harrow (tool)|harrowed]], and [[rake (tool)|raked]] the ground three times, and pulverized it with a [[mattock]], before planting seed. Unfortunately, the high evaporation rate resulted in a gradual increase in the salinity of the fields. By the Ur III period, farmers had switched from wheat to the more salt-tolerant [[barley]] as their principal crop.

Sumerians harvested during the [[spring (season)|spring]] in three-person teams consisting of a [[reaper]], a [[Reaper-binder|binder]], and a sheaf handler.&lt;ref&gt;By the sweat of thy brow: Work in the Western world, Melvin Kranzberg, Joseph Gies, Putnam, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The farmers would use [[threshing wagon]]s, driven by oxen, to separate the [[cereal]] heads from the [[stalk (botany)|stalks]] and then use threshing sleds to disengage the grain. They then [[winnowing|winnowed]] the grain/chaff mixture.

The Sumerians were great creators, nothing proving this more than their art. Sumerian artifacts show great detail and ornamentation, with fine semi-precious stones imported from other lands, such as [[lapis lazuli]], [[marble]], and [[diorite]], and precious metals like hammered gold, incorporated into the design. Since stone was rare it was reserved for sculpture. The most widespread material in Sumer was clay, as a result many Sumerina objects are made of clay. Metals such as gold, silver, copper, and bronze, along with shells and gemstones, were used for the finest sculpture and inlays. Small stones of all kinds, including more precious stones such as lapis lazuli, alabaster, and serpentine, were used for cylinder seals.

Some of the most famous masterpieces are the ''[[Lyres of Ur]]'', which are considered to be the world's oldest surviving [[stringed instrument]]s. They have been discovered by [[Leonard Woolley]] when the [[Royal Cemetery of Ur]] has been excavated between from 1922 and 1934.

The Tigris-Euphrates plain lacked minerals and trees. Sumerian structures were made of plano-convex [[mudbrick]], not fixed with [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or [[cement]]. Mud-brick buildings eventually deteriorate, so they were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This constant rebuilding gradually raised the level of cities, which thus came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resultant hills, known as [[Tell (archaeology)|tells]], are found throughout the ancient Near East.

According to [[Archibald Sayce]], the primitive [[pictogram]]s of the early Sumerian (i.e. Uruk) era suggest that &quot;Stone was scarce, but was already cut into blocks and seals. Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities, forts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a tower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a hinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a larger scale, and seems to have been double. The foundation stones—or rather bricks—of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sayce&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author-link=Archibald Sayce| last=Sayce | first=Rev.

The most impressive and famous of Sumerian buildings are the [[ziggurat]]s, large layered platforms that supported temples. Sumerian [[Cylinder seal|cylinder]] [[Seal (device)|seals]] also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those built by the [[Marsh Arabs]] of Southern Iraq until as recently as 400 CE. The Sumerians also developed the [[arch]], which enabled them to develop a strong type of [[dome]]. They built this by constructing and linking several arches. Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques, such as [[buttress]]es, [[Alcove (architecture)|recesses]], [[Column|half columns]], and [[clay nail]]s.

===Mathematics===
{{Main|Babylonian mathematics}}
The Sumerians developed a complex system of [[metrology]] c. 4000 BC. This advanced metrology resulted in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote [[multiplication table]]s on clay tablets and dealt with [[geometry|geometrical]] exercises and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] problems. The earliest traces of the [[Babylonian numerals]] also date back to this period.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan J. Melville (2003). [http://it.stlawu.edu/~dmelvill/mesomath/3Mill/chronology.html Third Millennium Chronology], ''Third Millennium Mathematics''. [[St. Lawrence University]].&lt;/ref&gt; The period c. 2700–2300 BC saw the first appearance of the [[abacus]], and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their [[sexagesimal]] number system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Ifrah|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumerians were the first to use a place value numeral system. There is also anecdotal evidence the Sumerians may have used a type of slide rule in astronomical calculations. They were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BKRE5AjRM3AC&amp;q=sherlock+holmes+in+babylon |title=Sherlock Holmes in Babylon: and other tales of mathematical history | first1=Marlow |last1=Anderson | first2=Robin J. |last2=Wilson |year= 2004 |access-date=2012-03-29| isbn= 978-0-88385-546-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy and trade===
[[File:Bill of sale Louvre AO3765.jpg|thumb|Bill of sale of a male slave and a building in [[Shuruppak]], Sumerian tablet, c. 2600 BC]]
Discoveries of [[obsidian]] from far-away locations in [[Anatolia]] and [[lapis lazuli]] from [[Badakhshan]] in northeastern [[Afghanistan]], beads from [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Bahrain]]), and several seals inscribed with the [[Indus Valley civilization|Indus Valley]] [[Indus script|script]] suggest a remarkably wide-ranging network of ancient trade centered on the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, [[Imports to Ur]] came from many parts of the world. In particular, the metals of all types had to be imported.

The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' refers to trade with far lands for goods, such as wood, that were scarce in Mesopotamia. In particular, [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] from [[Lebanon]] was prized. The finding of resin in the tomb of Queen [[Puabi]] at [[Ur]], indicates it was traded from as far away as [[Mozambique]].

The Sumerians used [[Slavery in antiquity|slaves]], although they were not a major part of the economy. Slave [[women]] worked as [[weaving|weavers]], pressers, [[miller]]s, and [[porter (carrying)|porters]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Sumerian [[pottery|potters]] decorated pots with [[cedar oil]] [[paint]]s. The potters used a [[bow drill]] to produce the [[fire]] needed for baking the pottery. Sumerian [[masonry|masons]] and [[jewelry|jewelers]] knew and made use of [[alabaster]] ([[calcite]]), [[ivory]], [[iron]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[carnelian]], and [[lapis lazuli]].&lt;ref&gt;Marian H.

[[Gudea]], the ruler of the Neo-Summerian Empire at [[Lagash]], is recorded as having imported &quot;translucent carnelian&quot; from [[Meluhha]], generally thought to be the Indus Valley area.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMI&quot;/&gt; Various inscriptions also mention the presence of Meluhha traders and interpreters in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMI&quot;/&gt; About twenty seals have been found from the Akkadian and [[Ur III]] sites, that have connections with Harappa and often use Harappan symbols or writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMI&quot;/&gt;

The Indus Valley Civilization only flourished in its most developed form between 2400 and 1800 BC, but at the time of these exchanges, it was a much larger entity than the Mesopotamian civilization, covering an area of 1.2 million square meters with thousands of settlements, compared to an area of only about 65.000 square meters for the occupied area of Mesopotamia, while the largest cities were comparable in size at about 30–40,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cotterell |first1=Arthur |title=Asia: A Concise History |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0470829592 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_vVTWXK5kQC&amp;pg=PT42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Money and credit====
Large institutions kept their accounts in [[barley]] and [[silver]], often with a fixed rate between them. The obligations, loans and prices in general were usually denominated in one of them. Many transactions involved debt, for example goods consigned to merchants by temple and beer advanced by &quot;ale women&quot;.&lt;ref name = debt&gt;{{cite book |title= Debt and Economic Renewal in the Ancient Near East|editor=Michael Hudson and Marc Van De Mieroop|last= Hudson|first= Michael|year= 1998|publisher= CDL|location= Bethesda, Maryland|isbn= 978-1-883053-71-0|pages= 23–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial credit and agricultural consumer loans were the main types of loans. The trade credit was usually extended by temples in order to finance trade expeditions and was nominated in silver. The interest rate was set at 1/60 a month (one [[shekel]] per [[mina (unit)|mina]]) some time before 2000 BC and it remained at that level for about two thousand years.&lt;ref name = debt/&gt;
Rural loans commonly arose as a result of unpaid obligations due to an institution (such as a temple), in this case the arrears were considered to be lent to the debtor.&lt;ref name = debt2&gt;{{cite book |title= Debt and Economic Renewal in the Ancient Near East|editor=Michael Hudson and Marc Van De Mieroop|last= Van De Mieroop|first= Marc|year= 1998|publisher= CDL|location= Bethesda, Maryland|isbn= 978-1-883053-71-0|page= 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were denominated in barley or other crops and the interest rate was typically much higher than for commercial loans and could amount to 1/3 to 1/2 of the loan principal.&lt;ref name = debt/&gt;

The cathedral, often being a large building, serves as a meeting place for many people. The cathedral often forms a centre of different activities related to community service, youth activities, study, music and decorative arts.

[[File:Pise Duomo.jpg|thumb|Some cathedrals are major tourist destinations and World Heritage Sites. [[Pisa Cathedral|Pisa]] is one of the best known.]]
Cathedral buildings, especially those dating from the Medieval period, are frequently the grandest of churches in the diocese (and country). The ancient cathedrals of England, of Northern France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Germany and Sicily, the Baroque cathedrals of South America, and many individual cathedrals from Italy and other parts of Europe, are among the largest and finest religious buildings. Many are renowned for their architecture or their decorative features such as [[sculpture]], [[stained glass]] and [[fresco]]s.

While cathedral buildings, in general, tend to be large, size and grandeur have rarely been essential requirements. Early [[Celt]]ic and [[Saxon people|Saxon]] cathedrals tended to be of diminutive size, as is the Byzantine so-called ''Little Metropole Cathedral'' of [[Athens]]. In Italy, with a few notable exceptions such as [[Florence Cathedral]] and [[Milan Cathedral]], cathedrals are numerous and are often similar in form and size to monastic or large parish churches. In modern times, where functionality is the foremost consideration and where church attendance is low in many countries, a cathedral church may be a modest structure.

Cathedrals of monastic foundation, and some of secular clergy, have [[cloister]]s, which traditionally provided an open area where secular activities took place protected from wind and rain. Some cathedrals also have a [[chapter house]] where the chapter could meet. In England, where these buildings have survived, they are often octagonal. A cathedral may front onto the main square of a town, as in [[Florence Cathedral|Florence]], or it may be set in a walled ''close'' as at [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]]. There may be a number of associated monastic or clergy buildings, a bishop's palace and often a school to educate the choristers.

===Artworks, treasures and tourism===
Many cathedral buildings are very famous for their architecture and have local and national significance, both artistically and historically. Many are listed among the [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].

Many cathedrals, because of their large size and the fact that they often have towers, spires or domes, have until the 20th century, been the major landmarks in cities or in views across the countryside. With highrise building, civil action has been taken in some cases, such as [[Cologne Cathedral]] to prevent the vista of the cathedral from being spoiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiscathedral.org/our-history |title=Our History |publisher=St Louis Cathedral |access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because many cathedrals took centuries to build and decorate, they constitute a major artistic investment for the city in which they stand. Not only may the building itself be architecturally significant, but the church often houses treasures such as stained glass, stone and wood statues, historic tombs, richly carved furniture and objects of both artistic and religious significance such as reliquaries. Moreover, the cathedral often plays a major role in telling the story of the town, through its plaques, inscriptions, tombs, stained glass and paintings.

For these reasons, tourists have travelled to cathedrals for hundreds of years. Many cathedrals cater for tourists by charging a fee to any visitors outside service times or requesting a donation or making a charge to take photos. Cathedrals that are particularly popular tourist venues sometimes provide guides, leaflets, souvenirs and cafes.

'''Leeuwarden''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|l|eɪ|v|ɑːr|d|ən}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|Leeuwarden|accessdate=31 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-nl|ˈleːʋɑrdə(n)|lang|453 Leeuwarden.ogg}}; {{lang-fy|Ljouwert|longname=yes}} {{IPA-fy|ˈljɔːʋ(ə)t|}}/{{IPA-all|ˈʎɔːw(ə)t||Fy-Ljouwert.ogg}}; [[Town Frisian]]: ''Liwwadden''; Leeuwarder dialect: ''Leewarden'') is a city and municipality in [[Friesland]] in the [[Netherlands]]. It is the provincial [[capital city|capital]] and seat of the [[States of Friesland]]. The municipality has a population of 122,293.

The region has been continuously inhabited since the 10th century. It came to be known as Leeuwarden in the early 9th century AD and was granted [[Town privileges|city privileges]] in 1435. It is the main economic hub of Friesland, situated in a green and water-rich environment. Leeuwarden is a former royal residence and has a historic city center, many historically relevant buildings, and a large shopping center with squares and restaurants. Leeuwarden was awarded the title [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2018.

The [[Elfstedentocht]] (Eleven Cities Tour), an ice skating tour passing the eleven cities of Friesland, started and finished in Leeuwarden.

The following towns and villages within the municipality have populations in excess of 1,000 people: Leeuwarden, [[Stiens]], [[Grou]], [[Goutum]], [[Wergea]], [[Jirnsum]], [[Reduzum]], and [[Wirdum, Friesland|Wirdum]]. The municipality is governed by the mayor [[Sybrand van Haersma Buma]] and a coalition of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], and [[GroenLinks|GreenLeft]].

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Leeuwarden&quot; (or older variants of it) first came into use for [[:nl:Nijehove|Nijehove]], the most important of the three villages (the other two being [[:nl:Oldehove (Leeuwarden)|Oldehove]] and [[:nl:Hoek (Leeuwarden)|Hoek]]) which in the early 9th century merged into Leeuwarden (Villa Lintarwrde {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;825).&lt;ref name=&quot;groot_10&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Groot|1984|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is much uncertainty about the origin of the city's name. Historian and archivist [[:nl:Wopke Eekhoff|Wopke Eekhoff]] summed up a total of over 200 different spelling variants, of which ''Leeuwarden'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''Liwwadden'' ([[Stadsfries]]), and ''Ljouwert'' ([[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]) are still in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180423-the-dutch-city-with-a-constantly-changing-name|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211102703/http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180423-the-dutch-city-with-a-constantly-changing-name|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-12-11|title=BBC - Travel - The Dutch city with a constantly changing name|date=2019-12-11|access-date=2020-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;groot_12&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Groot|1984|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of the name is easily explained: ''Warden'', West Frisian/Dutch/Low German for an artificial dwelling-hill, is a designation of [[terp]]s, reflecting the historical situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;groot_12&quot;/&gt;

The first part of the name, ''leeuw'', means [[lion]] in modern standard Dutch. This interpretation corresponds with the [[coat of arms]] adopted by the city, which features a [[Lion (heraldry)|heraldic lion]]. However, modern standard Dutch was not used in this region in the [[Middle Ages]], when the city was called ''Lintarwrde''. Some scholars argue that the name of the city is derived from ''leeu-'', a corruption of ''luw-'' (Dutch for sheltered from the wind, cf. the [[Sea|maritime]] term [[leeward]]) or from ''lee-'' (a Dutch word for waterway). ''Sheltered landing place or harbour'' could be the original meaning. This suits the watery province of [[Friesland]] and the position of the original three villages at the end of an important estuary called [[Middelzee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;groot_12&quot;/&gt;

The name is also similar to that of the French commune [[Lewarde]], located in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord Department]], an originally Flemish-speaking area annexed to France in the 17th century. Western Flemish was related to Frisian and also to Saxon up to the 11th century.

==History==
[[File:Beschrijving van Heerlijkheydt van Friesland door Bernardus Schotanus à Sterringa uitgegeven in 1664 leeuwarden.JPG|left|thumb|Historical map of Leeuwarden 1664]]
The oldest remains of houses date back to the 2nd century AD in the Roman era and were discovered during an excavation near the [[Oldehove (tower)|Oldehove]]. Inhabited continuously since the 10th century, the city's first reference as a population center is in German sources from 1285, and records exist of [[Town privileges|city privileges]] granted in 1435. Situated along the [[Middelzee]], it was an active center of maritime trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://historischcentrumleeuwarden.nl/english Stadsgeschiedenis Leeuwarden], [[Historisch Centrum Leeuwarden]].&lt;/ref&gt; The waterway silted-up in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Langen, G. de ''Leeuwarden 750 - 2000 Hoofdstad van Friesland'' p. 19 (Franeker 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grote of Jacobijnerkerk]] ({{lang-en|Great, or Jacobin Church}}) is the oldest building in the city. The 15th century was the period of the two opposing Frisian factional parties [[Vetkopers and Schieringers]]. The [[bastion]]s and a [[moat]] were built in the period 1481–1494. In 1747 [[William IV, Prince of Orange]] was the last [[stadtholder]] residing in the [[Stadhouderlijk Hof]]. In the first half of the 19th century the fortifications were demolished.

The Jewish community of Leeuwarden was one of the earliest in the Netherlands aside from [[Amsterdam]], and was first mentioned in 1645.&lt;ref name=&quot;bh.org.il&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Leeuwarden |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/leeuwarden |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.dutchjewry.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =The Jewish community of the city of Leeuwarden|URL=https://www.dutchjewry.org/drieluik/leeuwarden/leeuwarden.shtml|publisher=www.dutchjewry.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1670, the city council granted a man referred to as &quot;Jacob the Jew&quot; (in Dutch) permission to build a Jewish cemetery, meaning that there were enough Jews living there to require a cemetery and other communal institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;bh.org.il&quot; /&gt; Land for 'The Jodenkerkhof' (Jews' cemetery) was purchased in 1679, near the Oldehove tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.dutchjewry.org&quot; /&gt;

The first synagogue in the city was built in the 17th century as well, and was also used by the city's Catholics who were not allowed to build a house of worship of their own because of the Protestant city authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;bh.org.il&quot; /&gt; The Jewish community enjoyed generally good relations with authorities in the 18th century and continued to expand throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak population of 1,236 in 1860.&lt;ref name=&quot;bh.org.il&quot; /&gt;

In 1901 the city's population was 32,203.

After occupation by [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces (1940-1945), [[the Royal Canadian Dragoons]] disobeyed direct orders on 15 April 1945 and charged into the heavily defended city, driving out German forces by the end of the next day. The anniversary of the liberation is celebrated by the Dragoons and the city, who fly each other's flags on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://army.ca/forums/index.php?topic=29655.0|title=Army.ca forums|date=15 April 2005|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Kneppelfreed]]'' ({{lang-en|Baton Friday}}) was an incident on 16 November 1951 in front of the courthouse at Wilhelminaplein (Wilhelmina Square), when the police used [[baton (law enforcement)|batons]] against [[West Frisian language#Status|Frisian language]] activists during a protest against the exclusive use of Dutch in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.11en30.nu/de-canon-vensters/kneppelfreed?language=ned Canon of Frisian History - Kneppelfreed] 11en30.nu Retrieved 28 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; A committee of inquiry recommended that the Frisian language should receive legal status as a minority language.

On 19 October 2013, a fire broke out in a clothes shop on a busy pedestrian street. The fire started late in the afternoon and burned through the night, destroying five shops and eleven flats. The only casualty was a 24-year-old man who was living in one of the flats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efsca.org/IRD/Incident%20research%20%20De%20Kelders%20te%20Leeuwarden%20ENGELS.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328231002/http://www.efsca.org/IRD/Incident%20research%20%20De%20Kelders%20te%20Leeuwarden%20ENGELS.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 March 2018|title=Summary of inspection report of fire along De Kelders in Leeuwarden, 19 October 2013|date=19 October 2013|website=European Fire Service Colleges' Association|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birthplace of [[Mata Hari]] was at first thought to be destroyed, but survived, albeit with considerable smoke and water damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/hoy-san-diego/sdhoy-fire-destroys-house-where-mata-hari-was-born-2013oct20-story.html|title=Fire destroys house where Mata Hari was born|date=20 October 2013|website=San Diego Union Tribune|language=en|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldry==
The [[coat of arms]] of Leeuwarden is the official symbol of the municipality. It consists of a [[Azure (heraldry)|blue]] [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], a [[Or (heraldry)|golden]] [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]], and a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]]. The fact that Leeuwarden carries a lion in its seal seems logical, considering that &quot;Leeuw&quot; is Dutch for &quot;Lion&quot;. However, it is very plausible the oldest name of the city conceals an indication of water rather than an animal, and some sources suggest that the lion may have only been added after the name became official. It is also possible the coat of arms was a gift to the city from the powerful ''Minnema'' family.&lt;ref name=&quot;44_gemeenten&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Jansma|first1=Klaas |title=Friesland en zijn 44 gemeenten |publisher= Friesch Dagblad|year=1981 |isbn=90-6480-015-4 |page=45 |location=Leeuwarden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

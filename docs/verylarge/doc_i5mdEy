=== March on Washington, 1963 ===
{{Main|March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom}}
[[File:Bayard Rustin NYWTS 3.jpg|thumb|[[Bayard Rustin]] ''(left)'' and [[Cleveland Robinson]] ''(right)'', organizers of the March, on August 7, 1963]]A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on Washington, D.C., in 1941 to support demands for elimination of [[employment discrimination]] in defense industries; he called off the march when the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration met the demand by issuing [[Executive Order 8802]] barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clawson |first1=Laura |title=A.

Randolph and [[Bayard Rustin]] were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. In 1963, the Kennedy administration initially opposed the march out of concern it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, Randolph and King were firm that the march would proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kennedy, Johnson, and the Quest for Justice: The Civil Rights Tapes |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Jonathan |first2=Zachary |last2=Karabell |page=[https://archive.org/details/kennedyjohnsonth00rose/page/130 130] |isbn=978-0-393-05122-3 |year=2003 |publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co |url=https://archive.org/details/kennedyjohnsonth00rose/page/130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to work to ensure its success. Concerned about the turnout, President Kennedy enlisted the aid of white church leaders and [[Walter Reuther]], president of the [[United Automobile Workers|UAW]], to help mobilize white supporters for the march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Robert Kennedy and His Times |last=Schlesinger Jr. |first=Arthur M. |pages=[https://archive.org/details/robertkennedyhis01schl/page/350 350, 351] |isbn=978-0-618-21928-5 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books |orig-year=1978 |year=2002 |url=https://archive.org/details/robertkennedyhis01schl/page/350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-march-on-washington-white-activists-were-largely-overlooked-but-strategically-essential/2013/08/25/f2738c2a-eb27-11e2-8023-b7f07811d98e_story.html |title=In March on Washington, white activists were largely overlooked but strategically essential |last=Thompson |first=Krissah |date=August 25, 2013 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=March 24, 2018 |issn=0190-8286 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230800/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-march-on-washington-white-activists-were-largely-overlooked-but-strategically-essential/2013/08/25/f2738c2a-eb27-11e2-8023-b7f07811d98e_story.html |archive-date=March 20, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The march was held on August 28, 1963. Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals:
* meaningful civil rights laws
* a massive federal works program
* full and fair employment
* decent housing
* the right to vote
* adequate integrated education.
Of these, the march's major focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.

National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In the essay &quot;The March on Washington and Television News,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;southernspaces.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://southernspaces.org/2004/television-news-and-civil-rights-struggle-views-virginia-and-mississippi |author=William G.

The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]], where King delivered his famous &quot;[[I Have a Dream]]&quot; speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, [[John Lewis]] of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] took the administration to task for not doing more to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.

After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the [[White House]]. While the Kennedy administration appeared sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had enough votes in Congress to do so. However, when [[John F. Kennedy assassination|President Kennedy was assassinated]] on November 22, 1963,&lt;ref name=&quot;abbeville&quot; /&gt; the new President [[Lyndon B.

{{Main|Malcolm X|Black Nationalism|The Ballot or the Bullet}}

In March 1964, [[Malcolm X]] (el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz), national representative of the [[Nation of Islam]], formally broke with that organization, and made a public offer to collaborate with any civil rights organization that accepted the right to self-defense and the philosophy of Black nationalism (which Malcolm said no longer required [[Black separatism]]).

On March 26, 1964, as the Civil Rights Act was facing stiff opposition in Congress, Malcolm had a public meeting with Martin Luther King Jr. at the Capitol. Malcolm had tried to begin a dialog with King as early as 1957, but King had rebuffed him. Malcolm had responded by calling King an &quot;[[Uncle Tom]]&quot;, saying he had turned his back on black militancy in order to appease the white power structure. But the two men were on good terms at their face-to-face meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/malcolm-x &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, ''The King Encyclopedia'', eds.

Civil rights activists became increasingly combative in the 1963 to 1964 period, seeking to defy such events as the thwarting of the Albany campaign, police repression and [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Ku Klux Klan terrorism]] in [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham]], and the assassination of [[Medgar Evers]]. The latter's brother Charles Evers, who took over as Mississippi NAACP Field Director, told a public NAACP conference on February 15, 1964, that &quot;non-violence won't work in Mississippi...we made up our minds...that if a white man shoots at a Negro in Mississippi, we will shoot back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Akinyele Umoja, ''We Will Shoot Back: Armed Resistance in the Mississippi Freedom Movement'' (NYU Press, 2013), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The repression of sit-ins in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], provoked a riot in which black youth threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s at police on March 24, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fox Piven and Richard Cloward, ''Regulating the Poor'' (Random House 1971), p. 238; [https://books.google.com/books?id=bBQvmMnKmbcC&amp;pg=PA118 Abel A.

In his landmark April 1964 speech &quot;[[The Ballot or the Bullet]]&quot;, Malcolm presented an ultimatum to white America: &quot;There's new strategy coming in. It'll be Molotov cocktails this month, hand grenades next month, and something else next month.

As noted in the PBS documentary ''[[Eyes on the Prize]]'', &quot;Malcolm X had a far-reaching effect on the civil rights movement. In the South, there had been a long tradition of self-reliance. Malcolm X's ideas now touched that tradition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blackside Productions, ''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Movement 1954–1985'', [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_201.html&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423154235/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_201.html |date=April 23, 2010 }}, The Time Has Come&quot;, Public Broadcasting System&lt;/ref&gt; Self-reliance was becoming paramount in light of the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]]'s decision to refuse seating to the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP) and instead to seat the regular state delegation, which had been elected in violation of the party's own rules, and by [[Jim Crow law]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=John |title=Walking With the Wind |url=https://archive.org/details/walkingwithwindm00lewi |url-access=registration |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNCC moved in an increasingly militant direction and worked with Malcolm X on two Harlem MFDP fundraisers in December 1964.

''Malcolm X Speaks: Selected Speeches and Statements'' (Grove Press, 1965), pp. 106–109&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma campaign]] for voting rights in 1965, Malcolm made it known that he'd heard reports of increased threats of lynching around Selma. In late January he sent an open telegram to [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], the head of the [[American Nazi Party]], stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;if your present racist agitation against our people there in Alabama causes physical harm to Reverend King or any other black Americans...you and your KKK friends will be met with maximum physical retaliation from those of us who are not handcuffed by the disarming philosophy of nonviolence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EAhHl-0ERn8C&amp;pg=PA92 Christopher Strain, ''Pure Fire:Self-Defense as Activism in the Civil Rights Era'' (University of Georgia Press, 2005), pp. 92–93]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The following month, the Selma chapter of SNCC invited Malcolm to speak to a mass meeting there.

In 1964, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was arrested and spent a night in jail for attempting to eat at a white-only restaurant in [[St. Augustine, Florida]].]]

[[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] was famous as the &quot;Nation's Oldest City&quot;, founded by the Spanish in 1565. It became the stage for a great drama leading up to the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. A local movement, led by Robert B. Hayling, a black dentist and Air Force veteran affiliated with the NAACP, had been picketing segregated local institutions since 1963. In the fall of 1964, Hayling and three companions were brutally beaten at a Ku Klux Klan rally.

Nightriders shot into black homes, and teenagers Audrey Nell Edwards, JoeAnn Anderson, Samuel White, and Willie Carl Singleton (who came to be known as &quot;The St. Augustine Four&quot;) sat in at a local Woolworth's lunch counter, seeking to get served. They were arrested and convicted of trespassing, and sentenced to six months in jail and reform school. It took a special act of the governor and cabinet of Florida to release them after national protests by the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', [[Jackie Robinson]], and others.

In response to the repression, the St. Augustine movement practiced armed self-defense in addition to nonviolent direct action. In June 1963, Hayling publicly stated that &quot;I and the others have armed. We will shoot first and answer questions later. We are not going to die like Medgar Evers.&quot; The comment made national headlines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm#1963staug Civil Rights Movement Archive. &quot;St. Augustine FL, Movement—1963&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816034441/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm#1963staug |date=August 16, 2016 }}; [https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/hayling-robert-b &quot;Hayling, Robert B.&quot;, Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute, Stanford University]; [http://www.augustine.com/history/black_history/dr_robert_hayling/ &quot;Black History: Dr. Robert B.

In 1964, Hayling and other activists urged the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] to come to St. Augustine. Four prominent Massachusetts women – Mary Parkman Peabody, Esther Burgess, Hester Campbell (all of whose husbands were Episcopal bishops), and Florence Rowe (whose husband was vice president of the [[John Hancock Insurance Company]]) – also came to lend their support. The arrest of Peabody, the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, for attempting to eat at the segregated Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge in an integrated group, made front-page news across the country and brought the movement in St. Augustine to the attention of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/07/obituaries/mary-peabody-89-rights-activist-dies.html|title=MARY PEABODY, 89, RIGHTS ACTIVIST, DIES|work=New York Times|date=February 7, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely publicized activities continued in the ensuing months. When King was arrested, he sent a &quot;Letter from the St. Augustine Jail&quot; to a northern supporter, [[Rabbi]] [[Israel Dresner]]. A week later, in the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American history took place, while they were conducting a pray-in at the segregated Monson Motel. A well-known photograph taken in St. Augustine shows [[James Brock, the Monson Motor Lodge swim-in and civil rights in St Augustine, June–July 1964|the manager of the Monson Motel]] pouring [[muriatic acid]] in the swimming pool while blacks and whites are swimming in it. The horrifying photograph was run on the front page of a Washington newspaper the day the Senate was to vote on passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

=== Chester school protests, Spring 1964 ===
{{Main|Chester school protests}}
From November 1963 through April 1964, the [[Chester school protests]] were a series of civil rights protests led by [[George Raymond]] of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons]] (NAACP) and [[Stanley Branche]] of the Committee for Freedom Now (CFFN) that made [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] one of the key battlegrounds of the civil rights movement. [[James Farmer]], the national director of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] called Chester &quot;''the Birmingham of the North''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Mele&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mele |first1=Christopher |title=Race and the Politics of Deception: The Making of an American City |date=2017 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4798-6609-0 |pages=74–100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAl3DQAAQBAJ |access-date=October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Branche and the CFFN focused on improving conditions at the predominantly black Franklin Elementary school in Chester. Although the school was built to house 500 students, it had become overcrowded with 1,200 students. The school's average class-size was 39, twice the number of nearby all-white schools.&lt;ref name=Phoenix&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holcomb |first1=Lindsay |title=Questions surround student activism fifty-two years later |url=https://swarthmorephoenix.com/2015/10/29/questions-surround-student-activism-fifty-two-years-later/ |website=www.swarthmorephoenix.com |access-date=October 25, 2018|date=October 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was built in 1910 and had never been updated. Only two bathrooms were available for the entire school.&lt;ref name=nvdbase/&gt; In November 1963, CFFN protesters blocked the entrance to Franklin Elementary school and the Chester Municipal Building resulting in the arrest of 240 protesters. Following public attention to the protests stoked by media coverage of the mass arrests, the mayor and school board negotiated with the CFFN and NAACP.&lt;ref name=Mele/&gt; The Chester Board of Education agreed to [[class-size reduction|reduce class sizes]] at Franklin school, remove unsanitary toilet facilities, relocate classes held in the boiler room and coal bin and repair school grounds.&lt;ref name=nvdbase/&gt;

Emboldened by the success of the Franklin Elementary school demonstrations, the CFFN recruited new members, sponsored voter registration drives and planned a citywide boycott of Chester schools. Branche built close ties with students at nearby [[Swarthmore College]], [[Pennsylvania Military College]] and [[Cheyney State College]] in order to ensure large turnouts at demonstrations and protests.&lt;ref name=Mele/&gt; Branche invited [[Dick Gregory]] and [[Malcolm X]] to Chester to participate in the &quot;Freedom Now Conference&quot;&lt;ref name=McLarnon/&gt; and other national civil rights leaders such as [[Gloria Richardson]] came to Chester in support of the demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chester NAACP Scrapbook 1963-1964 |url=http://digitalwolfgram.widener.edu/digital/collection/p270801coll18/id/588 |website=www.digitalwolfgram.widener.edu |access-date=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, a series of almost nightly protests brought chaos to Chester as protestors argued that the Chester School Board had [[de facto]] [[Racial segregation|segregation]] [[School segregation in the United States|of schools]]. The mayor of Chester, [[James Gorbey]], issued &quot;The Police Position to Preserve the Public Peace&quot;, a ten-point statement promising an immediate return to law and order. The city deputized firemen and trash collectors to help handle demonstrators.&lt;ref name=Mele/&gt; The State of Pennsylvania deployed 50 state troopers to assist the 77-member Chester police force.&lt;ref name=nvdbase&gt;{{cite web |title=African American residents of Chester, PA, demonstrate to end de facto segregation in public schools, 1963-1966 |url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/african-american-residents-chester-pa-demonstrate-end-de-facto-segregation-public-schools-19 |website=www.nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu |access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrations were marked by violence and charges of police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=RIOTS MAR PEACE IN CHESTER, PA.; Negro Protests Continue - School Policy at Issue |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/26/archives/riots-mar-peace-in-chester-pa-negro-protests-continueschool-policy.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=July 13, 2018|date=April 26, 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over six hundred people were arrested over a two month period of civil rights rallies, marches, pickets, boycotts and sit-ins.&lt;ref name=Mele/&gt; Pennsylvania Governor [[William Scranton]] became involved in the negotiations and convinced Branche to obey a court-ordered moratorium on demonstrations.&lt;ref name=McLarnon&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLarnon |first1=John M. |title=&quot;Old Scratchhead&quot; Reconsidered: George Raymond &amp; Civil Rights in Chester, Pennsylvania |journal=Pennsylvania History |date=2002 |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=318–326 |url=https://journals.psu.edu/phj/article/viewFile/25768/25537 |access-date=October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scranton created the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission to conduct hearings on the de facto segregation of public schools. All protests were discontinued while the commission held hearings during the summer of 1964.{{sfn|Mele|2017|p=96}}

In November 1964, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission concluded that the Chester School Board had violated the law and ordered the Chester School District to desegregate the city's six predominantly African-American schools. The city appealed the ruling, which delayed implementation.&lt;ref name=nvdbase/&gt;

=== Freedom Summer, 1964 ===
{{Main|Freedom Summer}}

In the summer of 1964, [[Council of Federated Organizations|COFO]] brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi{{mdash}}most of them white college students from the North and West{{mdash}}to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in &quot;Freedom Schools,&quot; and organize the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP).&lt;ref name=&quot;crmvet.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/disc/mfdp.htm The Mississippi Movement &amp; the MFDP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424084752/http://www.crmvet.org/disc/mfdp.htm |date=April 24, 2008 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the [[White Citizens' Council]] and the Ku Klux Klan used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/docs/msrv64.pdf Mississippi: Subversion of the Right to Vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505032056/http://www.crmvet.org/docs/msrv64.pdf |date=May 5, 2010 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FBI Poster of Missing Civil Rights Workers.jpg|thumb|[[Missing persons]] poster created by the [[FBI]] in 1964 [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|shows the photographs]] of [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], [[James Chaney]], and [[Michael Schwerner]].]]

On June 21, 1964, [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|three civil rights workers disappeared]]: [[James Chaney]], a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two [[Jewish]] activists, [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], a [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] anthropology student; and [[Michael Schwerner]], a [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] organizer from [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]]. They were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of the members of the [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba County]] sheriff's department. This outraged the public, leading the U.S. Justice Department along with the FBI (the latter which had previously avoided dealing with the issue of segregation and persecution of blacks) to take action. The outrage over these murders helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the [[Mississippi Delta]] region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students, were established, and 28 community centers set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McAdam |first=Doug |title=Freedom Summer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-19-504367-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/freedomsummer00mcad }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of [[white supremacy]] arrayed against them{{mdash}}only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP), founded as an alternative political organization, showing their desire to vote and participate in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carson |first=Clayborne |title=In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the civil rights movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. The progression of events throughout the South increased media attention to Mississippi.&lt;ref name=&quot;crmvet1&quot;&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/vet/vethome.htm Veterans Roll Call] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423070052/http://www.crmvet.org/vet/vethome.htm |date=April 23, 2008 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of affluent northern white students and threats to non-Southerners attracted the full attention of the media spotlight to the state. Many black activists became embittered, believing the media valued lives of whites and blacks differently. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers, almost all of whom{{mdash}}black and white{{mdash}}still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;crmvet1&quot; /&gt;

=== Civil Rights Act of 1964 ===
{{Main|Civil Rights Act of 1964}}

Although President Kennedy had [[Civil Rights Address|proposed civil rights legislation]] and it had support from Northern Congressmen and Senators of both parties, Southern Senators blocked the bill by threatening [[filibuster]]s. After considerable parliamentary maneuvering and 54 days of filibuster on the floor of the United States Senate, President Johnson got a bill through the Congress.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=521–524}}

[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|thumb|Lyndon B. Johnson signs the historic [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]]]

On July 2, 1964, Johnson signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot; /&gt; which banned discrimination based on &quot;race, color, religion, sex or national origin&quot; in employment practices and public accommodations. The bill authorized the Attorney General to file lawsuits to enforce the new law. The law also nullified state and local laws that required such discrimination.

=== Harlem riot of 1964 ===
{{Main|Harlem riot of 1964}}

When police shot an unarmed black teenager in Harlem in July 1964, tensions escalated out of control. Residents were frustrated with racial inequalities. Rioting broke out, and [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]], a major black neighborhood in Brooklyn, erupted next. That summer, [[1964 Philadelphia race riot|rioting also broke out in Philadelphia]], for similar reasons. The riots were on a much smaller scale than what would occur in 1965 and later.

Washington responded with a pilot program called [[Project Uplift]]. Thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by [[Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited|HARYOU]] called ''[[Youth in the Ghetto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Youth in the Ghetto: A Study of the Consequences of Powerlessness'', Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited, Inc., 1964&lt;/ref&gt; HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the [[National Urban League]] and nearly 100 smaller community organizations.&lt;ref&gt;''Poverty and Politics in Harlem'', Alphnso Pinkney and Roger Woock, College &amp; University Press Services, Inc., 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent jobs at living wages were still out of reach of many young black men.

=== Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964 ===
{{Main|Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party}}

Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 19th century. In 1963 COFO held a [[1963 Freedom Ballot|Freedom Ballot]] in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election, which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the &quot;Freedom Party&quot; against the official state Democratic Party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm Freedom Ballot in MS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816034441/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm |date=August 16, 2016 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

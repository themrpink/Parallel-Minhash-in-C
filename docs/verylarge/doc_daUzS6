Hanks actively attends church. He said, &quot;I must say that when I go to church‚Äîand I do go to church‚ÄîI ponder the mystery.

[[File:Plymouth Montserrat Heli.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Plymouth, Montserrat]] is the only ghost town that is the capital of a modern political territory.]]
A '''ghost town''' or alternatively '''deserted city''' or '''abandoned city''' is an abandoned [[village]], [[town]], or [[city]], usually one that contains substantial visible remaining buildings and infrastructure such as roads. A town often becomes a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it (usually industrial or agricultural) has failed, or due to natural or human-caused disasters such as [[floods]], prolonged [[drought]]s, government actions, uncontrolled [[lawlessness]], [[war]], [[pollution]], or [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear disasters]]. The term can sometimes refer to cities, towns, and neighbourhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in past years; for example, those affected by high levels of unemployment and dereliction.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

Some ghost towns, especially those that preserve period-specific architecture, have become tourist attractions. Some examples are [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]] in the [[United States]], [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] in [[Canada]], [[Craco]] in [[Italy]], [[Agdam]] in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kolmanskop]] in [[Namibia]], [[Pripyat]] in [[Ukraine]], and [[Danushkodi]] in [[India]].

The town of [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]] on the Caribbean island of [[Montserrat]] is a ghost town that is the ''[[de jure]]'' [[Capital city|capital]] of Montserrat. It was rendered uninhabitable by volcanic ash from an eruption of the [[Soufri√®re Hills Volcano]].

==Definition==
The definition of a ghost town varies between individuals, and between cultures. Some writers discount settlements that were abandoned as a result of a natural or human-made disaster or other causes using the term only to describe settlements that were deserted because they were no longer economically viable; T. Lindsey Baker, author of ''Ghost Towns of Texas'', defines a ghost town as &quot;a town for which the reason for being no longer exists&quot;.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first= T. Lindsay |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Z4EFgxTW8oC&amp;pg=PR9 |title=More Ghost Towns of Texas |year=2003 |location=Norman, OK |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=0806135182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that any settlement with visible tangible remains should not be called a ghost town;&lt;ref name=Rockies&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Robert L.|title=Ghost Towns of the Colorado Rockies|year=1990|publisher=Caxton Printers|location=Caldwell, Idaho|isbn=0870043420|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXOjzn5b-tAC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt; others say, conversely, that a ghost town should contain the tangible remains of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomsen |first=Clint |year=2012 |title=Ghost Towns: Lost Cities of the Old West |publisher=Osprey Publishing |chapter=What is a ghost town? |isbn=1782001077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not the settlement must be completely deserted, or may contain a small population, is also a matter for debate.&lt;ref name=Rockies/&gt; Generally, though, the term is used in a looser sense, encompassing any and all of these definitions. American author Lambert Florin's defined a ghost town as &quot;a shadowy semblance of a former self&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Shawn|title=Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of Southern Nevada|year=2010|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0738570125|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHLCS4HNjuQC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for abandonment==
Factors leading to the abandonment of towns include depleted natural resources, economic activity shifting elsewhere, railroads and roads bypassing or no longer accessing the town, human intervention, disasters, massacres, wars, and the shifting of politics or fall of empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves |first1=Philip |last2=Weiler |first2=Stephan |last3=Tynon |first3=Emily |ssrn=1540770 |title=The Economics of Ghost Towns|publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A town can also be abandoned when it is part of an [[exclusion zone]] due to [[Plymouth, Montserrat|natural]] or [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|man-made causes]].

===Economic activity shifting elsewhere===
[[File:Abandoned farmhouse, overgrown.jpg|thumb|right|As farms [[Intensive farming|industrialize]], smaller farms are no longer economically viable, leading to rural decay.]]

Ghost towns may result when the single activity or resource that created a [[boomtown]] (e.g., nearby mine, mill or resort) is depleted or the resource economy undergoes a &quot;bust&quot; (e.g., catastrophic resource price collapse). Boomtowns can often decrease in size as fast as they initially grew. Sometimes, all or nearly the entire population can desert the town, resulting in a ghost town.

The dismantling of a boomtown can often occur on a planned basis. Mining companies nowadays will create a temporary community to service a mine site, building all the accommodations, shops and services required, and then remove them once the resource has been extracted. Modular buildings can be used to facilitate the process. A [[gold rush]] would often bring intensive but short-lived economic activity to a remote village, only to leave a ghost town once the resource was depleted.

In some cases, multiple factors may remove the economic basis for a community; some former [[mining town]]s on [[U.S. Route 66]] suffered both mine closures when the resources were depleted and loss of highway traffic as US 66 was diverted away from places like [[Oatman, Arizona]] onto a more direct path. Mine and pulp mill closures have led to many ghost towns in British Columbia, Canada including several relatively recent ones: [[Ocean Falls]] which closed in 1973 after the pulp mill was decommissioned, [[Kitsault]] B.C. whose molybdenum mine shut down after only 18 months in 1982, and [[Cassiar, British Columbia|Cassiar]] whose asbestos mine operated from 1952 to 1992.

In other cases, the reason for abandonment can arise from a town's intended economic function shifting to another, nearby place. This happened to [[Collingwood, Queensland]] in [[Outback]] [[Australia]] when nearby [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]] outperformed Collingwood as a regional centre for the livestock-raising industry. The railway reached Winton in 1899, linking it with the rest of [[Queensland]], and Collingwood was a ghost town by the following year.

The Middle East has many ghost towns that were created when the shifting of politics or the fall of empires caused capital cities to be socially or economically unviable, such as [[Ctesiphon]].

The rise of condominium investment and a resulting real estate bubble may also lead to a ghost town, as real estate prices rise and affordable housing becomes less available. Such examples include [[China]] and [[Canada]], where housing is often used as an investment rather than for habitation.&lt;!---What does that first clause mean?---&gt;

===Human intervention===
[[File:Famagusta-Varosha 2007.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Prior to the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]], now falling into ruin, was once a modern tourist area.]]

Railroads and roads bypassing or no longer reaching a town can also create a ghost town. This was the case in many of the ghost towns along Ontario's historic [[Opeongo Line]], and along [[U.S. Route 66]] after motorists bypassed the latter on the faster moving highways [[Interstate 44|I-44]] and [[Interstate 40|I-40]]. Some ghost towns were founded along railways where [[steam train]]s would stop at periodic intervals to take on water. [[Amboy, California]] was part of one such series of villages along the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] across the [[Mojave Desert]].

River re-routing is another factor, one example being the towns along the [[Aral Sea]].

Ghost towns may be created when land is [[eminent domain|expropriated]] by a government, and residents are required to relocate. One example is the village of [[Tyneham]] in [[Dorset]], England, acquired during World War II to build an artillery range.

A similar situation occurred in the U.S. when [[NASA]] acquired land to construct the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] (SSC), a rocket testing facility in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] (on the Mississippi side of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi‚ÄìLouisiana)|Pearl River]], which is the [[Mississippi]]‚Äì[[Louisiana]] state line). This required NASA to acquire a large (approximately {{convert|34|sqmi|adj=on}}) [[buffer zone]] because of the loud noise and potential dangers associated with testing such rockets. Five thinly populated rural Mississippi communities (Gainesville, Logtown, Napoleon, Santa Rosa, and Westonia), plus the northern portion of a sixth ([[Pearlington, Mississippi|Pearlington]]), along with 700 families in residence, had to be completely relocated away from the facility.

[[File:Akarmaraghosttown.jpg|thumb|[[Akarmara]], a [[mining town]] in [[Abkhazia]]/[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], was abandoned in the early 1990s due to the [[War in Abkhazia (1992‚Äì93)|War in Abkhazia]].]]
Sometimes the town might cease to officially exist, but the physical infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities that had to be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room schoolhouse. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of [[Weston, DuPage County, Illinois|Weston, Illinois]], that voted itself out of existence and turned the land over for construction of the [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]. Many houses and even a few barns remain, used for housing visiting scientists and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used to cross through the site have been blocked off at the edges of the property, with gatehouses or barricades to prevent unsupervised access.

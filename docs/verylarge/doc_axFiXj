As a patron of poets and authors James supported [[William Stewart (makar)|William Stewart]] and [[John Bellenden]], the son of his nurse, who translated the Latin ''History of Scotland'' compiled in 1527 by [[Hector Boece]] into verse and prose.&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijnsbergen, Theo, 'Literature in Queen Mary's Edinburgh: the Bannatyne Manuscript', in ''The Renaissance in Scotland'' (Brill, 1994), pp. 191–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Lyndsay|Sir David Lindsay of the Mount]], the [[Lord Lyon]], head of the [[Lyon Court]] and diplomat, was a prolific poet.  He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play ''[[A Satire of the Three Estates|The Thrie Estaitis]]'' in 1540. James also attracted the attention of international authors. The French poet [[Pierre de Ronsard]], who had been a page of Madeleine of Valois, offered unqualified praise;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Son port estoit royal, son regard vigoureux&lt;br /&gt;

James was a poet himself; his works include &quot;The Gaberlunzieman&quot; and &quot;The Jolly Beggar&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Eyre-Todd|title=Scottish Poetry of the Sixteenth Century|year=1892|publisher=W. Hodge and Co|location=Glasgow|pages=139...182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he married Mary of Guise, [[Robert Reid (bishop)|Giovanni Ferrerio]], an Italian scholar who had been at Kinloss Abbey in Scotland, dedicated to the couple a new edition of his work ''On the true significance of comets against the vanity of astrologers.''&lt;ref&gt;Ferrerio, Giovanni, ''De vera cometae significatione contra astrologorum omnium vanitatem. Libellus, nuper natus et aeditus'', Paris , Vascovan, (1538).&lt;/ref&gt; Like Henry VIII, James employed many foreign artisans and craftsmen in order to enhance the prestige of his renaissance court.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Andrea, ''Princelie Majestie, the court of James V'', John Donald, (2005), 226–243.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie]] listed their professions;&lt;blockquote&gt;he plenished the country with all kind of craftsmen out of other countries, as French-men, Spaniards, Dutch men, and Englishmen, which were all cunning craftsmen, every man for his own hand. Some were gunners, wrights, carvers, painters, masons, smiths, harness-makers (armourers), tapesters, broudsters, taylors, cunning chirugeons, apothecaries, with all other kind of craftsmen to apparel his palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay of Pitscottie, Robert, ''The History of Scotland'' (Edinburgh, 1778), p. 238: abbreviated in Lindsay of Pitscottie, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1814), p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; One technological initiative was a special mill for polishing armour at Holyroodhouse next to his mint. The mill had a pole drive 32 feet long powered by horses.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Masters of Work'', vol. 1 (HMSO, 1957), pp. 101–102, 242 290: Thomas Andrea, ''Princelie Majestie'' (John Donald, 2005), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary of Guise's mother [[Antoinette of Bourbon]] sent him an armourer. The armourer made steel plates for his jousting saddles in October 1538, and delivered a [[tassets|skirt]] of [[plate armour]] in February 1540. In the same year, for his wife's coronation, the treasurer's accounts record that James personally devised fireworks made by his master gunners.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 7 (1907), 95, 287 (taslet), 357 fireworks: [[Marguerite Wood]], ''Balcarres Papers'', vol. 1 (SHS: Edinburgh, 1923), pp. 18, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; When James took steps to suppress the circulation of slanderous ballads and rhymes against Henry VIII, Henry sent Fulke ap Powell, [[Lancaster Herald]], to give thanks and to make arrangements for the present of a lion for James's [[menagerie]] of exotic pets.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers Henry VIII'', vol. 14 part 1, (1894), xix, no. 406: vol. 14 part 2 (London, 1895), no. 781.&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of James's mother in 1541 removed any incentive for peace with England, and war broke out. Initially the Scots won a victory at the [[Battle of Haddon Rig]] in August 1542. The Imperial ambassador in London, [[Eustace Chapuys]], wrote on 2 October that the Scottish ambassadors ruled out a conciliatory meeting between James and Henry VIII in England until the pregnant Mary of Guise delivered her child. Henry would not accept this condition and mobilised his army against Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Spanish: 1542–1543'', vol. 6 part 2, London (1895), p. 144, no.66.&lt;/ref&gt;

James was with his army at [[Lauder]] on 31 October 1542. Although he hoped to invade England, his nobles were reluctant.&lt;ref&gt;''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol.5 part 4 part 2, (1836), 213: [https://books.google.com/books?id=SQgXAAAAQAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Laing, David, ed., ''The Works of John Knox'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1846)] pp. 389–391.&lt;/ref&gt;
He returned to Edinburgh, on the way writing a letter in French to his wife from Falahill mentioning he had three days of illness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nUdRAAAAYAAJ Strickland, Agnes, ''Lives of the queens of Scotland and English princesses'', vol. 1, Blackwood (1850), 402] part translated only; now preserved as [[National Archives of Scotland]] SP13/27.&lt;/ref&gt; The next month his army suffered a serious defeat at the [[Battle of Solway Moss]].  He took ill shortly after this, on 6 December; by some accounts this was a nervous collapse caused by the defeat, and he may have died from the grief, although some historians consider that it may just have been an ordinary fever. [[John Knox]] later described his final movements in Fife.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, John, {{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/15422.html |title=from ''History of the Reformation'', book 2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829095527/http://www.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/15422.html |archivedate=29 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the cause of his illness, James was on his deathbed at [[Falkland Palace]] when his only surviving legitimate child, a girl, was born. Sir [[George Douglas of Pittendreich]] brought the news of the king's death to Berwick. He said James died at midnight on Thursday 15 December; the king was talking but delirious and spoke no &quot;wise words.&quot; According to George Douglas in his delirium James lamented the capture of his banner and [[Oliver Sinclair]] at Solway Moss more than his other losses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924091786032 Bain, JS., ed., ''The Hamilton Papers'', vol. 1, Edinburgh, (1890)] 336–339.&lt;/ref&gt; An English chronicler suggested another cause of the king's grief was his discomfort on hearing of the murder of the English [[Somerset Herald]], [[Thomas Trahern]], at [[Dunbar]].&lt;ref&gt;''Grafton's Chronicle'', vol. ii, London (1809), 488.&lt;/ref&gt; James died at [[Falkland Palace]] but was buried at [[Holyrood Abbey]] in [[Edinburgh]] with his first wife Queen Madeleine.&lt;ref&gt;Collection of Epitaphs and Monumental Inscriptions: Chiefly in Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he died he is reported to have said &quot;it came wi a lass, it'll gang wi a lass&quot; (meaning &quot;It began with a girl and it will end with a girl&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Tudors (The History of England Volume 2) by Peter Ackroyd. Pan Books {{ISBN|9781447236818}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was either a reference to the [[Stewart dynasty]]'s accession to the throne through [[Marjorie Bruce]], daughter of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] or to the medieval origin myth of the Scots nation, recorded in the ''[[Scotichronicon]]'' in which the Scots people are descended from the Princess [[Scota]].

The [[James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran|Earl of Arran]] and [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]] ordered his wardrobe servant [[John Tennent]] to give items of his clothing and armour to their supporters and allies.

==Aftermath==
James was succeeded by his infant daughter Mary. He was buried at [[Holyrood Abbey]] alongside his first wife [[Madeleine of Valois|Madeleine]] and his two sons in January 1543. David Lindsay supervised the construction of his tomb. One of his French artists, [[Andrew Mansioun]], carved a lion and an inscription in [[Latin alphabet|Roman letters]] measuring eighteen feet. The tomb was destroyed in the sixteenth century, according to [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] as early as 1544, by the English during the [[burning of Edinburgh (1544)|burning of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/accountslordhig00unkngoog ''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 8 (1908)] 142–143: [https://books.google.com/books?id=J2AJAAAAQAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Works of Drummond of Hawthornden: History of the Five Jameses'', (Edinburgh 1711)], p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland was ruled by [[Regent Arran]] and was soon drawn into the war of the [[The Rough Wooing|Rough Wooing]].

[[Pope Clement VII]] sent a dispensation to James V dated 30 August 1534, allowing four of the children to take holy orders when they came of age.

The number of species has long been debated, but two in western [[North America]] and two to four in eastern [[Asia]] are commonly acknowledged.&lt;ref name=eflora&gt;{{cite web|title=Flora of China: ''Pseudotsuga''|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=127289|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=conifer&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gymnosperm Database: ''Pseudotsuga''|url=http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pseudotsuga.php|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nineteenth-century botanists had problems in classifying Douglas firs, due to the species' similarity to various other conifers better known at the time; they have at times been classified in ''[[Pinus]]'', ''[[Picea]]'', ''[[Abies]]'', ''[[Tsuga]]'', and even ''[[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]]''. Because of their distinctive cones, Douglas firs were finally placed in the new genus ''Pseudotsuga'' (meaning &quot;false hemlock&quot;) by the French botanist [[Elie-Abel Carrière|Carrière]] in 1867.  The genus name has also been hyphenated as ''Pseudo-tsuga''.

==Name==
The tree takes its English name from [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[botanist]] who first introduced ''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'' into cultivation at [[Scone Palace]] in 1827.&lt;ref name=podcast&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/national-trust-for-scotland/id281616873 Trust Walks: &quot;Dunkeld and The Hermitage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112055717/https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/national-trust-for-scotland/id281616873 |date=12 November 2012 }},&quot; a podcast by the National Trust for Scotland; 27 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas is known for introducing many native American tree species to Europe. The hyphenated form &quot;Douglas-fir&quot; is used by some to indicate that ''Pseudotsuga'' species are not true [[fir]]s, which belong to the genus ''Abies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=E.

==Description==
Douglas-firs are medium-size to extremely large [[evergreen]] [[tree]]s, {{convert|20|-|120|m|-1}} tall (although only coast Douglas-firs reach such great height).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Giants of the World Past and Present|first=Al|last=Carder|year=1995|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[leaf|leaves]] are flat, soft, linear, {{convert|2|-|4|cm|in|1}} long, generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in [[fascicle (botany)|fascicle]]s; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. The female [[Conifer cone|cones]] are pendulous, with persistent scales (unlike true firs), and are distinctive in having a long tridentine (three-pointed) [[bract]] that protrudes prominently above each scale (it resembles the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail).

All of the other species are of restricted range and little-known outside of their respective native environments, where they are often rare and of scattered occurrence in mixed forests; all those have unfavorable [[conservation status]].

== Uses ==
[[Image:Douglas Fir buds.jpg|thumb|150px|The buds of a coast Douglas-fir]]
Douglas-fir [[wood]] is used for structural applications that are required to withstand high loads. It is used extensively in the construction industry. Other examples include its use for homebuilt [[aircraft]] such as the RJ.03 IBIS canard. Very often, these aircraft were designed to utilize [[Sitka spruce]], which is becoming increasingly difficult to source in aviation quality grades. Oregon pine is also used in [[boat building]] when it is available in long, fairly [[Knot (wood)|knot]]-free lengths. Most timber now comes from plantation forests in North America which are managed to produce faster growing timber with fewer knots. This timber is generally lighter but weaker. Traditionally, Oregon pine was used in [[mast (sailing)|mast]] building due to its ability to resist bending loads without fracturing. This was based on using older native forest wood with a high number of growth rings per inch. This sort of wood is seldom available new but can be sourced from merchants dealing in [[recycled timber]]. Native Oregon pine is considerably heavier than [[Sitka spruce]], which is about the same weight as [[western red cedar]], but with far better bending characteristics than cedar. Large-sized Oregon pine, as used in beams, is inclined to split as it dries, like oak, but this does not reduce its strength.

Douglas-fir is one of the most commonly marketed [[Christmas tree]] species in the United States, where they are sold alongside firs like [[noble fir]] and [[grand fir]]. Douglas-fir Christmas trees are usually trimmed to a near perfect cone instead of left to grow naturally like noble and grand firs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christmastree.org/trees/douglas.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205024200/http://www.christmastree.org/trees/douglas.cfm |archivedate= 5 December 2005 |title=National Christmas Tree Association |publisher=Christmastree.org |accessdate=2011-03-09 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pests and diseases==
{{Main|List of Douglas-fir diseases}}
Douglas-firs are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species, including [[autumnal moth]], [[bordered white]], [[engrailed (moth)|engrailed moth]], [[pine beauty]] and [[turnip moth]]. The [[Gelechiidae|gelechiids]] ''[[Chionodes abella]]'' and ''[[Chionodes periculella]]'' and the [[tortrix moth]] ''[[Cydia illutana]]'' have been specifically recorded on ''P. menziesii''.

==Culture==
A California [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] myth explains that each three-ended bract is the tail and two tiny legs of a [[mouse]] that hid inside the scales of the tree's cones during forest fires, and the tree was kind enough to be its enduring sanctuary.

A Douglas-fir species, ''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'', is the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Oregon]].

'''Domoic acid''' ('''DA''') is a [[kainic acid]]-type [[neurotoxin]] that causes [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]] (ASP).&lt;ref name = &quot;Clayden_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clayden J, Read B, Hebditch KR | title = Chemistry of domoic acid, isodomoic acids, and their analogues. | journal = Tetrahedron | date = 2005 | volume = 24 | issue = 61 | pages = 5713–24 | doi = 10.1016/j.tet.2005.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by [[algae]] and accumulates in [[shellfish]], [[sardines]], and [[anchovies]]. When sea lions, otters, cetaceans, humans, and other predators eat contaminated animals, poisoning may result. Exposure to this compound affects the brain, causing seizures, and possibly death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Domoic Acid Toxicity|url=http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/science/top-research-projects/domoic-acid-toxicity.html|website=The Marine Mammal Center|access-date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There has been little use of domoic acid throughout history except for in [[Japan]], where it has been used as an [[anthelmintic]] for centuries.
Domoic acid was first isolated in 1959 from a species of red algae, ''[[Chondria (alga)|Chondria armata]]'', in Japan; commonly referred to as &quot;doumoi&quot; (in [[Tokunoshima]]'s dialect word) or &quot;hanayanagi&quot;. Poisonings in history have been rare, or undocumented; however, it is thought that the increase in human activities is resulting in an increasing frequency of harmful [[algal blooms]] along coastlines in recent years. In 2015, the North American pacific coast was heavily impacted by an algal bloom, consisting predominantly of the domoic acid producing pennate diatom, ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]].'' Consequently, elevated levels of domoic acid were measured in stranded marine mammals, prompting the closure of beaches and damaging razor clam, rock crab and Dungeness crab fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCabe RM, Hickey BM, Kudela RM, Lefebvre KA, Adams NG, Bill BD, Gulland FM, Thomson RE, Cochlan WP, Trainer VL | title = An unprecedented coastwide toxic algal bloom linked to anomalous ocean conditions | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 43 | issue = 19 | pages = 10366–10376 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27917011 | pmc = 5129552 | doi = 10.1002/2016GL070023 | bibcode = 2016GeoRL..4310366M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, seabirds attacked the [[Capitola, California|Capitola]] area in [[California]], and though it was never confirmed, they were thought to be under the influence of domoic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOMOIC ACID - A major concern to washington state's shellfish lovers|url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/shellfish/razorclams/domoic_acid.html|website=Washington Department of Fish and wildlife|access-date=12 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203063841/http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/shellfish/razorclams/domoic_acid.html|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, on [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada, there was a shellfish poisoning resulting in 3 deaths.

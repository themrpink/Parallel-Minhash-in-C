===Timing of proxies===
The field of [[geochronology]] has scientists working on determining how old certain proxies are. For recent proxy archives of tree rings and corals the individual year rings can be counted and an exact year can be determined. [[Radiometric dating]] uses the properties of radioactive elements in proxies. In older material, more of the radioactive material will have decayed and the proportion of different elements will be different than of newer proxies. One example of radiometric dating is [[radiocarbon dating]]. In the air, [[cosmic ray]]s constantly convert nitrogen into a specific radioactive carbon isotope, [[Carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]]. When plants then use this carbon to grow, this isotope is not replenished anymore and starts decaying. The proportion of 'normal' carbon and Carbon-14 gives information of how long the plant material has not been in contact with the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronin|2010|pp=32–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the atmosphere==
{{Life timeline}}
{{See also|Atmosphere of Earth|History of Earth}}

===Earliest atmosphere===
The [[paleoatmosphere|first atmosphere]] would have consisted of gases in the [[Solar nebula#Formation of planets|solar nebula]], primarily [[hydrogen]]. In addition, there would probably have been simple [[hydride]]s such as those now found in gas giants like [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], notably [[water]] vapor, [[methane]], and [[ammonia]]. As the solar nebula dissipated, the gases would have escaped, partly driven off by the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=Zahnle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zahnle|first1=K.|last2=Schaefer|first2=L.|last3=Fegley|first3=B.|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a004895|title=Earth's Earliest Atmospheres|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|volume=2|issue=10|pages=a004895|year=2010|pmid=20573713|pmc=2944365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second atmosphere===
The next atmosphere, consisting largely of [[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and inert gases, was produced by outgassing from [[volcanism]], supplemented by gases produced during the [[late heavy bombardment]] of Earth by huge [[asteroids]].&lt;ref name=Zahnle/&gt; A major part of carbon dioxide emissions were soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments.

Water-related sediments have been found dating from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;B. Windley: ''The Evolving Continents.'' Wiley Press, New York 1984&lt;/ref&gt; About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen was the major part of the then stable &quot;second atmosphere&quot;. An influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere because hints of early life forms have been dated to as early as 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schopf: ''Earth's Earliest Biosphere: Its Origin and Evolution.'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that it is not perfectly in line with the 30% lower solar radiance (compared to today) of the early Sun has been described as the &quot;[[faint young Sun paradox]]&quot;.

The geological record, however, shows a continually relatively warm surface during the complete early [[temperature record]] of Earth with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late [[Archean|Archaean]] eon, an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently from photosynthesizing [[cyanobacteria]] (see [[Great Oxygenation Event]]) which have been found as [[stromatolite]] fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy ([[isotope ratio]] proportions) was very much in line with what is found today, suggesting that the fundamental features of the [[carbon cycle]] were established as early as 4 billion years ago.

===Third atmosphere===
The constant rearrangement of continents by [[plate tectonics]] influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago, during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], and its appearance is indicated by the end of the [[banded iron formations]]. Until then, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials. That point was a shift from a [[redox|reducing]] atmosphere to an [[oxidizing]] atmosphere. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Scotese, [http://www.scotese.com/precamb_chart.htm Back to Earth History: Summary Chart for the Precambrian], Paleomar Project&lt;/ref&gt; The following time span was the [[Phanerozoic]] eon, during which oxygen-breathing [[metazoan]] life forms began to appear.

The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of 35%&lt;ref name=Beerling2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Beerling|first=David|author-link=David Beerling|year=2007|title=The emerald planet: how plants changed Earth's history|url=https://archive.org/details/emeraldplanethow00beer|url-access=registration|publisher=Oxford University press|isbn=9780192806024|page=[https://archive.org/details/emeraldplanethow00beer/page/n64 47]}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Carboniferous]] period, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: plants [[photosynthesis|use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]], releasing oxygen and the breakdown of [[pyrite]] and [[volcanic eruption]]s release [[sulfur]] into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for rapid development of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward:[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11630] Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate during geological ages==
[[File:GlaciationsinEarthExistancelicenced annotated.jpg|thumb|600px|right|Timeline of glaciations, shown in blue]]
{{See also|Timeline of glaciation}}
* The [[Huronian glaciation]], is the first known glaciation in Earth's history, and lasted from 2400 to 2100 million years ago.
* The [[Cryogenian glaciation]] lasted from 720 to 635 million years ago.
* The [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]] lasted from 450 to 420 million years ago.
* The [[Karoo glaciation]] lasted from 360 to 260 million years ago.
* The [[Quaternary glaciation]] is the current glaciation period and began 2.58 million years ago.

In 2020 scientists published a continuous, high-fidelity [[Global temperature record|record of variations in Earth's climate during the past 66 million years]] and identified four [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|climate states]], separated by transitions that include changing greenhouse gas levels and polar ice sheets volumes. They integrated data of various sources. The warmest climate state since the time of the dinosaur extinction, &quot;Hothouse&quot;, endured from 56 Mya to 47 Mya and was ~14 °C warmer than average modern temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=High-fidelity record of Earth's climate history puts current changes in context |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-09-high-fidelity-earth-climate-history-current.html |accessdate=8 October 2020 |work=phys.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Westerhold |first1=Thomas |last2=Marwan |first2=Norbert |last3=Drury |first3=Anna Joy |last4=Liebrand |first4=Diederik |last5=Agnini |first5=Claudia |last6=Anagnostou |first6=Eleni |last7=Barnet |first7=James S.

===Precambrian climate===
{{Main|Precambrian}}
The climate of the late Precambrian showed some major [[glaciation]] events spreading over much of the earth. At this time the continents were bunched up in the [[Rodinia]] supercontinent. Massive deposits of [[tillite]]s and anomalous [[isotopic signature]]s are found, which gave rise to the [[Snowball Earth]] hypothesis. As the [[Proterozoic|Proterozoic Eon]] drew to a close, the Earth started to warm up. By the dawn of the Cambrian and the Phanerozoic, life forms were abundant in the [[Cambrian explosion]] with average global temperatures of about 22 °[[Celsius|C]].

===Phanerozoic climate===
[[File:Phanerozoic Climate Change.png|thumb|450px|Changes in [[oxygen-18]] ratios over the last 500 million years, indicating climate change]]
{{Main|Phanerozoic}}
Major drivers for the preindustrial ages have been variations of the sun, volcanic ashes and exhalations, relative movements of the earth towards the sun, and tectonically induced effects as for major sea currents, watersheds, and ocean oscillations. In the early Phanerozoic, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have been linked to driving or amplifying increased global temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Came|first=Rosemarie E.|last2=Eiler|first2=John M.|last3=Veizer|first3=Jan|last4=Azmy|first4=Karem|last5=Brand|first5=Uwe|last6=Weidman|first6=Christopher R|title=Coupling of surface temperatures and atmospheric {{CO2}} concentrations during the Palaeozoic era|journal=Nature|volume=449|pages=198–201|date=September 2007|doi=10.1038/nature06085|pmid=17851520|issue=7159|bibcode=2007Natur.449..198C|s2cid=4388925|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/35545/2/nature06085-s1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royer et al. 2004&lt;ref name=&quot;Dana&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Royer|first1=Dana L.|last2=Berner|first2=Robert A.|last3=Montañez|first3=Isabel P.|last4=Tabor|first4=Neil J.|last5=Beerling|first5=David J.|author5-link=David J.

The difference in global mean temperatures between a fully glacial Earth and an ice free Earth is estimated at approximately 10&amp;nbsp;°C, though far larger changes would be observed at high latitudes and smaller ones at low latitudes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} One requirement for the development of large scale ice sheets seems to be the arrangement of continental land masses at or near the poles. The constant rearrangement of continents by [[plate tectonics]] can also shape long-term climate evolution. However, the presence or absence of land masses at the poles is not sufficient to guarantee glaciations or exclude polar ice caps. Evidence exists of past warm periods in Earth's climate when polar land masses similar to [[Antarctica]] were home to [[deciduous]] forests rather than ice sheets.

The relatively warm local minimum between [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] goes along with an increase of subduction and mid-ocean ridge volcanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Douwe G.

Superimposed on the long-term evolution between hot and cold climates have been many short-term fluctuations in climate similar to, and sometimes more severe than, the varying glacial and interglacial states of the present [[ice age]]. Some of the most severe fluctuations, such as the [[Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]], may be related to rapid climate changes due to sudden collapses of natural [[methane clathrate]] reservoirs in the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Frieling|first1=Joost|last2=Svensen|first2=Henrik H.|last3=Planke|first3=Sverre|last4=Cramwinckel|first4=Margot J.|last5=Selnes|first5=Haavard|last6=Sluijs|first6=Appy|date=25 October 2016|title=Thermogenic methane release as a cause for the long duration of the PETM|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=43|pages=12059–12064|doi=10.1073/pnas.1603348113|issn=0027-8424|pmid=27790990|pmc=5087067|bibcode=2016PNAS..11312059F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar, single event of induced severe climate change after a [[meteorite impact]] has been proposed as reason for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. Other major thresholds are the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic]], and [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction events]] with various reasons suggested.

The [[Quaternary]] [[geological period]] includes the current climate. There has been a cycle of [[ice age]]s for the past 2.2–2.1 million years (starting before the Quaternary in the late [[Neogene]] Period).

Note in the graphic on the right the strong 120,000-year periodicity of the cycles, and the striking asymmetry of the curves. This asymmetry is believed to result from complex interactions of feedback mechanisms. It has been observed that ice ages deepen by progressive steps, but the recovery to interglacial conditions occurs in one big step.

The graph on the left shows the temperature change over the past 12,000 years, from various sources. The thick black curve is an average.

==Climate forcings==
{{Main|Climate change#Causes}}
[[Climate forcing]] is the difference between radiant energy ([[sunlight]]) received by the Earth and the [[outgoing longwave radiation]] back to space. Radiative forcing is quantified based on the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amount in the [[tropopause]], in units of watts per square meter to the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|author=IPCC|title=Concept of Radiative Forcing|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-2.html|publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]|author-link=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependent on the [[radiative balance]] of incoming and outgoing energy, the Earth either warms up or cools down. Earth radiative balance originates from changes in solar [[insolation]] and the concentrations of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[aerosols]]. Climate change may be due to internal processes in Earth sphere's and/or following external forcings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|author=IPCC|title=What are Climate Change and Climate Variability?|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-1.html|publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]|author-link=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal processes and forcings===
The Earth's [[climate system]] involves the [[atmosphere]], [[biosphere]], [[cryosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[lithosphere]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA|title=Glossary, Climate system|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Glossary/index.php?mode=alpha&amp;seg=b&amp;segend=d|date=March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sum of these processes from Earth's spheres is what affects the climate. Greenhouse gasses act as the internal forcing of the climate system. Particular interests in climate science and paleoclimatology focus on the study of Earth [[climate sensitivity]], in response to the sum of forcings.

Examples:
* [[Thermohaline circulation]] (Hydrosphere)
* [[Life]] (Biosphere)

===External forcings===
* The [[Milankovitch cycles]] determine Earth distance and position to the Sun. The solar insolation is the total amount of solar radiation received by Earth.
* Volcanic eruptions are considered an external forcing.&lt;ref name=&quot;IPCC AR5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IPCC AR5|url=http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_AnnexIII_FINAL.pdf|title=Annex III: Glossary|quote=Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings, such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions, and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human changes of the composition of the atmosphere or land use.&lt;ref name=&quot;IPCC AR5&quot;/&gt;

===Mechanisms===
On timescales of millions of years, the uplift of mountain ranges and subsequent [[weathering]] processes of rocks and soils and the [[subduction]] of [[tectonic plates]], are an important part of the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldeira|first=Ken|title=Enhanced Cenozoic chemical weathering and the subduction of pelagic carbonate|journal=Nature|date=18 June 1992|volume=357|pages=578–581|doi=10.1038/357578a0|issue=6379|bibcode=1992Natur.357..578C|s2cid=45143101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cin-Ty Aeolus Lee|author2=Douglas M.

'''Charles Lapworth''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Geological Society|FGS]] (20 September 1842 – 13 March 1920) was an English geologist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Lapworth, Charles|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1020|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1020}}&lt;/ref&gt; who pioneered faunal analysis using [[index fossil]]s and identified the [[Ordovician]] period.

== Biography ==
Charles Lapworth was born at [[Faringdon]] in Berkshire (now [[Oxfordshire]]) the son of James Lapworth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf|access-date=12 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074135/https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was trained as a teacher at the Culham Diocesan Training College near Abingdon, Oxfordshire. He moved to the Scottish border region, where he investigated the previously little-known fossil [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]] of the area. There in 1869 he married Janet, daughter of [[Galashiels]] schoolmaster Walter Sanderson and stayed in the area. Eventually, through patient mapping and innovative use of index fossil analysis, based on a sequence exposed at [[Dob's Linn]], Lapworth showed that what was thought to be a thick sequence of [[Silurian]] rocks was in fact a much thinner series of rocks repeated by faulting and folding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Charles | last = Lapworth | title = The Moffat Series | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society | date = 1878 | volume = 34 | pages = 241–346 | url = https://archive.org/details/LapworthMoffatSeries1878QuJouGeolSocVol34Page240 | doi=10.1144/gsl.jgs.1878.034.01-04.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed this pioneering research in the Southern Uplands while employed as a schoolmaster for 11 years at the Episcopal Church school, Galashiels. He then studied geology and became in 1875 an assistant at [[Madras College]] in St Andrews, Fife, and then in 1881 the first professor of geology at [[Mason Science College]], later the [[University of Birmingham]], where he taught until his retirement.

He is best known for pioneering faunal analysis of Silurian beds by means of [[index fossil]]s, especially [[graptolite]]s, and his proposal (eventually adopted) that the beds between the [[Cambrian]] beds of north [[Wales]] and the [[Silurian]] beds of South Wales should be assigned to a new geological period: the [[Ordovician]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lapworth (1879) [https://books.google.com/books?id=JJpZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  &quot;On the Tripartite Classification of the Lower Palaeozoic Rocks,&quot;] ''Geological Magazine'', new series, '''6''' : 1–15.  From pp. 13–14:  &quot;North Wales itself – at all events the whole of the great Bala district where Sedgwick first worked out the physical succession among the rocks of the intermediate or so-called ''Upper Cambrian'' or ''Lower Silurian'' system; and in all probability much of the Shelve and the Caradoc area, whence Murchison first published its distinctive fossils – lay within the territory of the Ordovices; …  Here, then, have we the hint for the appropriate title for the central system of the Lower Palaeozoics.  It should be called the Ordovician System, after this old British tribe.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal resolved a long running controversy which began when [[Roderick Murchison]] and [[Adam Sedgwick]] argued over the relative ages of the strata in question. Lapworth received numerous awards for his research work, while for teaching he used the English Midlands as a setting for demonstrating the fieldwork techniques he had pioneered in his own research.

[[File:Lapworth 1891 Olenellus Callavei.png|thumb|left|Olenellus Callavei, from Lapworth (1891)&lt;ref name=&quot;Lapworth1891&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lapworth |first1=Charles |title=On Olenellus Callavei and its Geological Relationships |journal=Geological Magazine |date=1891 |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=529-536 |url=https://archive.org/details/lapworth-1891-geologicalmagazi-381891wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Following his researches in the Southern Uplands Charles Lapworth also devoted time to mapping near [[Durness]] in Scotland's northwest highlands and was first to propose the controversial theory that here older rocks were found lying above younger, suggesting complex folding or faulting as a cause.&lt;ref&gt;Lapworth, Charles (1883) &quot;The secret of the Highlands,&quot; ''The Geological Magazine'', decade ii, '''10''' :  [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044102911971;view=1up;seq=142 120–128] ; [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044102911971;view=1up;seq=219 193–199] ; [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044102911971;view=1up;seq=367 337–344.] &lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Ben Peach|Peach]] and [[John Horne|Horne]] were dispatched to the area and their monumental memoir proved Lapworth correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peach1884&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peach |first1=B.N. |last2=Horne |first2=John |title=Report on the Geology of the North-West of Sutherland |journal=Nature |date=1884 |volume=31 |issue=785 |pages=31-35 |url=https://archive.org/details/paper-doi-10_1038_031031a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peach1888&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peach |first1=B.N. |last2=Horne |first2=J. |last3=Gunn |first3=W. |last4=Clough |first4=C.T. |last5=Hinxman |first5=L. |last6=Cadell |first6=H.M. |title=Report on the Recent Work of the Geological Survey in the North-west Highlands of Scotland, based on the Field-notes and Maps |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society |date=1888 |volume=44 |pages=378-441 |url=https://archive.org/details/peach-1888-quarterlyjournal-44188geol}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Geikie1907&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geikie |first1=Archibald |last2=Peach |first2=Bejamin Neave |last3=Horne |first3=John |last4=Gunn |first4=William |last5=Clough |first5=Charles Thomas |last6=Hinxman |first6=Lionel Wordworth |last7=Teall |first7=Jethro Justinian Harris |title=The geological structure of the north-west Highlands of Scotland |date=1907 |publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office |location=Glasgow |url=https://archive.org/details/geologicalstruc00peacgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English Midlands he carried out important work in Shropshire, in particular identifying fossils of [[Olenellina|Olenelloid trilobites]] of Cambrian age, demonstrating that Cambrian rocks underlay the Carboniferous rocks between Nuneaton and Atherstone, and suggesting a pre-Cambrian date for the [[Longmyndian Supergroup|Longmyndian]] rocks that underlay them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lapworth1888a&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lapworth |first1=Charles |title=On the Discovery of the Olenellus Fauna in the Lower Cambrian Rocks of Britain |journal=Nature |date=1888 |volume=39 |issue=1000 |pages=212-213 |url=https://archive.org/details/paper-doi-10_1038_039212b0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He extrapolated these findings to the N.W. Highlands of Scotland, suggesting that the Torridonian sandstone might correspond to the Longmyndian rocks, and thus be pre-Cambrian rather than Cambrian, and that the Durness-Eriboll series, overlaying the Torridonian, would be of Cambrian age rather than Silurian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lapworth1891&quot;/&gt; Again Peach and Horne, surveying in [[Dundonnell and Fisherfield Forest|Dundonnell Forest]], confirmed Lapworths's suggestion, finding Olenelloid fossils in the fucoid beds of the Durness-Eriboll series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peach1892&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peach |first1=B.N. |last2=Horne |first2=J. |title=The Olenellus Zone in the North-west Highlands of Scotland |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society |date=1892 |volume=48 |pages=227-242 |url=https://archive.org/details/peach-1892-quarterlyjournal-48189geol}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a modern account and discussion of the elucidation of the geology of the N.W.

He died on 13 March 1920 and is buried in [[Lodge Hill Cemetery]] near Birmingham.

==Family==

He married Janet Sanderson in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf|access-date=12 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074135/https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His son [[Arthur Lapworth]] became a renowned chemist and his son Herbert a civil engineer, engineering geologist, stratigrapher and palaeontologist.

== Honours and awards ==
Lapworth received many awards for his work and contributions to geology. In June 1888 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and in 1891 was awarded their [[Royal Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27lapworth%27%29 | title = Library and Archive Catalogue | publisher = Royal Society | accessdate = 7 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, he received the highest award of the [[Geological Society of London]], the [[Wollaston Medal]], in recognition of his outstanding work in the Southern Uplands, and Northwest Highlands of Scotland. There years later, in February 1902, he was elected President of the Geological Society for the years 1902–1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Geological Society of London|day_of_week=Monday |date=24 February 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36699| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The glacial [[Lake Lapworth]], was named for him by [[Leonard Johnston Wills]] in recognition of his original suggestion of its existence in 1898.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wills&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wills|first=L.J.|year=1924|title=The Development of the Severn Valley in the Neighbourhood of Iron-Bridge and Bridgnorth|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society|volume=80|pages=274–308|doi=10.1144/GSL.JGS.1924.080.01-04.15|url=http://jgslegacy.lyellcollection.org/content/80/1-4/274.abstract|accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aberdeen University]] awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1884 and [[Glasgow University]] in 1912 (both LLD).

In 1916 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

== Lapworth Museum ==
Papers relating to Charles Lapworth can be found at the [[University of Birmingham]] Special Collections. The University of Birmingham also maintains the [[Lapworth Museum of Geology]] within the Aston Webb building on the main Edgbaston campus. The Lapworth Archive, housed in the museum, contains a remarkably complete record of all areas of his research work and teaching.

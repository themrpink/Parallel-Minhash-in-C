'''''A Midsummer Night's Dream''''' is a [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] written by [[William Shakespeare]] in 1595/96. The play is set in Athens and consists of several subplots that revolve around the marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta. One subplot involves a conflict between four Athenian lovers. Another follows a group of six amateur actors rehearsing the play which they are to perform before the wedding. Both groups find themselves in a forest inhabited by fairies who manipulate the humans and are engaged in their own domestic intrigue. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular and is widely performed.

==Plot ==
[[File:HermiaandHelena.jpg|thumb|upright|''Hermia and Helena'' by [[Washington Allston]], 1818]]
The play consists of four interconnecting plots, connected by a celebration of the wedding of Duke [[Theseus]] of [[Athens]] and the [[Amazons|Amazon]] queen, [[Hippolyta]], which are set simultaneously in the woodland and in the realm of [[Fairy]]land, under the light of the moon.

The play opens with [[Hermia]] who is in love with Lysander, resistant to her father [[Egeus]]'s demand that she wed [[Demetrius (Shakespeare)|Demetrius]], whom he has arranged for her to marry. [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]], Hermia's best friend, pines [[Unrequited love|unrequitedly]] for Demetrius, who broke up with her to be with Hermia. Enraged, Egeus invokes an ancient Athenian [[law]] before Duke Theseus, whereby a daughter needs to marry a suitor chosen by her father, or else face death. Theseus offers her another choice: lifelong [[chastity]] as a [[nun]] worshipping the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].

[[Peter Quince]] and his fellow players [[Nick Bottom]], [[Francis Flute]], [[Robin Starveling]], [[Tom Snout]] and [[Snug (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Snug]] plan to put on a play for the wedding of the Duke and the Queen, &quot;the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]]&quot;. Quince reads the names of characters and bestows them on the players. Nick Bottom, who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time. Quince insists that Bottom can only play the role of Pyramus. Bottom would also rather be a tyrant and recites some lines of [[Hercules|Ercles]]. Bottom is told by Quince that he would do the Lion so terribly as to frighten the duchess and ladies enough for the Duke and Lords to have the players [[Hanging|hanged]]. Snug remarks that he needs the Lion's part because he is &quot;slow of study&quot;. Quince assures Snug that the role of the lion is &quot;nothing but roaring.&quot; Quince then ends the meeting telling his actors &quot;at the Duke's oak we meet&quot;.

[[File:Sir Joseph Noel Paton - The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|''The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania'' by [[Joseph Noel Paton]], 1849]]
In a parallel plot line, [[Oberon]], king of the fairies, and [[Titania]], his queen, have come to the forest outside Athens. Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding. Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian [[changeling]] to Oberon for use as his &quot;knight&quot; or &quot;henchman&quot;, since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers. Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience. He calls upon Robin &quot;[[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]]&quot; Goodfellow, his &quot;shrewd and knavish sprite&quot;, to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called &quot;[[love-in-idleness]]&quot;, which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid's arrow. When the concoction is applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living thing they perceive. He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that he might make Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy. He says, &quot;And ere I take this charm from off her sight, / As I can take it with another herb, / I'll make her render up her page to me.&quot;

Hermia and Lysander have escaped to the same forest in hopes of running away from Theseus. Helena, desperate to reclaim Demetrius's love, tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of finding Hermia. Helena continually makes advances towards Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia. However, he rebuffs her with cruel insults. Observing this, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man. Instead, Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius, not having actually seen either before, and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander. Helena, coming across him, wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep. Upon this happening, Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena. Helena, thinking Lysander is playing a trick on her, runs away with Lysander following her. When Hermia wakes up, she sees that Lysander is gone and goes out in the woods to find him. Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia, who thinks Demetrius killed Lysander, and is enraged. When Demetrius goes to sleep, Oberon sends Puck to get Helena while he charms Demetrius' eyes. Upon waking up, he sees Helena. Now, both men are in love with Helena. However, she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally. Hermia finds Lysander and asks why he left her, but Lysander claims he never loved Hermia, just Helena. Hermia accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her while Helena believes Hermia joined the two men in mocking her. Hermia tries to attack Helena, but the two men protect Helena. Lysander, tired of Hermia's presence, insults her and tells her to leave. Lysander and Demetrius decide to seek a place to duel to prove whose love for Helena is the greater. The two women go their own separate ways, Helena hoping to reach Athens and Hermia chasing after the men to make sure Lysander doesn't get hurt or killed. Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander so Lysander can return to love Hermia, while Demetrius continues to love Helena with none of them having any memory of what happened, as if it were a dream.

[[File:My Mistress with a Monster is in Love.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Puck, Titania and Bottom in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' from Act III, Scene II by [[Charles Buchel]], 1905]]
Meanwhile, Quince and his band of six labourers (&quot;rude [[Mechanical (character)|mechanicals]]&quot;, as they are described by Puck) have arranged to perform their play about [[Pyramus and Thisbe]] for Theseus' wedding and venture into the forest, near Titania's [[dwelling|bower]], for their rehearsal. Quince leads the actors in their rehearsal of the play. Bottom is spotted by Puck, who (taking his name to be another word for a [[Donkey|jackass]]) transforms his head into that of a [[donkey]]. When Bottom returns for his next lines, the other workmen run screaming in terror: They claim that they are haunted, much to Bottom's confusion. Determined to await his friends, he begins to sing to himself. Titania, having received the love-potion, is awakened by Bottom's singing and immediately falls in love with him. She lavishes him with the attention of her and her fairies, and while she is in this state of devotion, Oberon takes the [[changeling]] boy. Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania, orders Puck to remove the donkey's head from Bottom, and arranges everything so Helena, Hermia, Demetrius and Lysander will all believe they have been dreaming when they awaken. Puck distracts Lysander and Demetrius from fighting over Helena's love by mimicking their voices and leading them apart. Eventually, all four find themselves separately falling asleep in the glade. Once they fall asleep, Puck administers the love potion to Lysander again, returning his love to Hermia again, and claiming all will be well in the morning.

The fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt. They find the lovers still sleeping in the glade. They wake up the lovers and, since Demetrius no longer loves Hermia, Theseus over-rules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding. The lovers at first believe they are still in a dream and can't recall what has happened. The lovers decide that the night's events must have been a dream. After they exit, Bottom awakes, and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream &quot;past the wit of man&quot;.

At Quince's house, he and his team of actors worry that Bottom has gone missing. Quince laments that Bottom is the only man who can take on the lead role of Pyramus. Bottom returns, and the actors get ready to put on &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe.&quot;

In Athens, Theseus, Hippolyta and the lovers watch the six workmen perform ''Pyramus and Thisbe.'' The performers are so terrible playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy, and everyone retires to bed. Afterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and other fairies enter, and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune. After all the other characters leave, Puck &quot;restores amends&quot; and suggests that what the [[audience]] experienced might just be a dream.

It is unknown exactly when ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was written or first performed, but on the basis of topical references and an allusion to [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Epithalamion (poem)|Epithalamion]]'', it is usually dated 1595 or early 1596. Some have theorised that the play might have been written for an aristocratic wedding (for example that of [[Elizabeth Carey, Lady Berkeley]]), while others suggest that it was written for the [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen]] to celebrate the [[Midsummer Day|feast day]] of [[John the Apostle|St. John]], but no evidence exists to support this theory. In any case, it would have been performed at [[The Theatre]] and, later, [[Globe Theater|The Globe]]. Though it is not a translation or adaptation of an earlier work, various sources such as [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and [[Chaucer]]'s &quot;[[The Knight's Tale]]&quot; served as inspiration.{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=lix}} According to John Twyning, the play's plot of four lovers undergoing a trial in the woods was intended as a &quot;riff&quot; on ''[[Der Busant]]'', a [[Middle High German]] poem.{{sfn|Twyning|2012|p=77}}

According to Dorothea Kehler, the writing period can be placed between 1594 and 1596, which means that Shakespeare had probably already completed ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and was still in contemplation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. The play belongs to the author's early-middle period, a time when Shakespeare devoted primary attention to the [[lyricism]] of his works.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=3}}

==Date and text==
[[File:First Quarto Printing of A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|left|The title page from the first quarto, printed in 1600]]
The play was entered into the [[Stationers' Register|Register]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]] on 8 October 1600 by the bookseller [[Thomas Fisher (printer)|Thomas Fisher]], who published the [[first quarto]] edition later that year.{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=xxi}} A [[second quarto]] was printed in 1619 by [[William Jaggard]], as part of his so-called [[False Folio]].{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=xxi}} The play next appeared in print in the [[First Folio]] of 1623. The title page of [[first quarto|Q1]] states that the play was &quot;sundry times publickely acted&quot; prior to 1600.{{sfn|Brooks|1979|p=lvii}} The first performance known with certainty occurred at Court on 1 January 1604.

==Themes and motifs==
===Lovers' bliss===

In [[Ancient Greece]], long before the creation of the Christian celebrations of [[Midsummer|St. John's Day]], the summer solstice was marked by [[Adonia]], a festival to mourn the death of [[Adonis]], the devoted mortal lover of the goddess [[Aphrodite]]. According to [[Metamorphoses|Ovid's Metamorphoses]], Aphrodite took the orphaned infant Adonis to the [[underworld]] to be raised by [[Persephone]]. He grew to be a beautiful young man, and when Aphrodite returned to retrieve him, Persephone did not want to let him go. Zeus settled the dispute by giving Adonis one-third of the year with Persephone, one-third of the year with Aphrodite, and the remaining third where he chose. Adonis chose to spend two-thirds of the year with his paramour, Aphrodite. He bled to death in his lover's arms after being gored by a boar. Mythology has various stories attributing the color of certain flowers to staining by the blood of Adonis or Aphrodite.

The story of Venus and Adonis was well known to the Elizabethans and inspired many works, including Shakespeare's own hugely popular narrative poem, [[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]], written while London's theaters were closed because of plague. It was published in 1593.&lt;ref&gt;[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta and the mistaken and waylaid lovers, Titania and Bottom, even the erstwhile acting troupe, model various aspects (and forms) of love.

===Carnivalesque===
Both David Wiles of the [[University of London]] and [[Harold Bloom]] of [[Yale University]] have strongly endorsed the reading of this play under the themes of [[Carnivalesque]], [[Bacchanalia]], and [[Saturnalia]].{{sfn|Wiles|2008|pp=208–23}} Writing in 1998, David Wiles stated that: &quot;The starting point for my own analysis will be the proposition that although we encounter ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' as a text, it was historically part of an aristocratic carnival. It was written for a wedding, and part of the festive structure of the wedding night. The audience who saw the play in the public theatre in the months that followed became vicarious participants in an aristocratic festival from which they were physically excluded. My purpose will be to demonstrate how closely the play is integrated with a historically specific upper-class celebration.&quot;  {{sfn|Wiles|2008|p=213}} Wiles argued in 1993 that the play was written to celebrate the Carey-Berkeley wedding. The date of the wedding was fixed to coincide with a conjunction of Venus and the new moon, highly propitious for conceiving an heir.&lt;ref&gt;Wiles 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Love===
[[File:Simmons-Hermia and Lysander. A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|''Hermia and Lysander'' by [[John Simmons (painter)|John Simmons]] (1870)]]
[[David Bevington]] argues that the play represents the dark side of love. He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Queen Titania's eyes, forcing her to fall in love with an ass.{{sfn|Bevington|1996|pp=24–35}} In the forest, both couples are beset by problems. Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck, who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest. However, the play also alludes to serious themes. At the end of the play, Hippolyta and Theseus, happily married, watch the play about the unfortunate lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, and are able to enjoy and laugh at it.{{sfn|Bevington|1996|p=32}} Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love, totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest.

===Problem with time===
There is a dispute over the scenario of the play as it is cited at first by Theseus that &quot;four happy days bring in another moon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', I.I.2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The wood episode then takes place at a night of no moon, but Lysander asserts that there will be so much light in the very night they will escape that dew on the grass will be shining like liquid pearls.&lt;ref&gt;''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', I.I.208–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the next scene, Quince states that they will rehearse in moonlight,&lt;ref&gt;''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', I.II.90–9.&lt;/ref&gt; which creates a real confusion. It is possible that the Moon set during the night allowing Lysander to escape in the moonlight and for the actors to rehearse, then for the wood episode to occur without moonlight. Theseus's statement can also be interpreted to mean &quot;four days until the next month&quot;. Another possibility is that, since each month there are roughly four consecutive nights that the moon is not seen due to its closeness to the sun in the sky (the two nights before the moment of new moon, followed by the two following it), it may in this fashion indicate a liminal &quot;dark of the moon&quot; period full of magical possibilities. This is further supported by Hippolyta's opening lines exclaiming &quot;And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night of our solemnities.&quot;; the thin crescent-shaped moon being the hallmark of the new moon's return to the skies each month. The play also intertwines the Midsummer Eve of the title with [[May Day]], furthering the idea of a confusion of time and the seasons. This is evidenced by Theseus commenting on some slumbering youths, that they &quot;observe The rite of May&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', IV.I.131–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of individual identity===
[[File:Edwin Landseer - Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edwin Landseer]], ''[[Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom]]'' (1848)]]

Maurice Hunt, Chair of the English Department at [[Baylor University]], writes of the blurring of the identities of fantasy and reality in the play that make possible &quot;that pleasing, narcotic dreaminess associated with the fairies of the play&quot;.{{sfn|Hunt|1986}} By emphasising this theme, even in the setting of the play, Shakespeare prepares the reader's mind to accept the fantastic reality of the fairy world and its happenings. This also seems to be the axis around which the plot conflicts in the play occur. Hunt suggests that it is the breaking down of individual identities that leads to the central conflict in the story.{{sfn|Hunt|1986}} It is the brawl between Oberon and Titania, based on a lack of recognition for the other in the relationship, that drives the rest of the drama in the story and makes it dangerous for any of the other lovers to come together due to the disturbance of Nature caused by a fairy dispute.{{sfn|Hunt|1986}} Similarly, this failure to identify and to distinguish is what leads Puck to mistake one set of lovers for another in the forest, placing the flower's juice on Lysander's eyes instead of Demetrius'.{{sfn|Hunt|1986}}

Victor Kiernan, a Marxist scholar and historian, writes that it is for the greater sake of love that this loss of identity takes place and that individual characters are made to suffer accordingly: &quot;It was the more extravagant cult of love that struck sensible people as irrational, and likely to have dubious effects on its acolytes.&quot;{{sfn|Kiernan|1993|p=212}} He believes that identities in the play are not so much lost as they are blended together to create a type of haze through which distinction becomes nearly impossible. It is driven by a desire for new and more practical ties between characters as a means of coping with the strange world within the forest, even in relationships as diverse and seemingly unrealistic as the brief love between Titania and Bottom: &quot;It was the tidal force of this social need that lent energy to relationships.&quot;{{sfn|Kiernan|1993|p=210}}

The aesthetics scholar David Marshall draws out this theme even further by noting that the loss of identity reaches its fullness in the description of the mechanicals and their assumption of other identities. In describing the occupations of the acting troupe, he writes &quot;Two construct or put together, two mend and repair, one weaves and one sews. All join together what is apart or mend what has been rent, broken, or sundered.&quot;{{sfn|Marshall|1982}} In Marshall's opinion, this loss of individual identity not only blurs specificities, it creates new identities found in community, which Marshall points out may lead to some understanding of Shakespeare's opinions on love and marriage. Further, the mechanicals understand this theme as they take on their individual parts for a corporate performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. Marshall remarks that &quot;To be an actor is to double and divide oneself, to discover oneself in two parts: both oneself and not oneself, both the part and not the part.&quot;{{sfn|Marshall|1982}} He claims that the mechanicals understand this and that each character, particularly among the lovers, has a sense of laying down individual identity for the greater benefit of the group or pairing. It seems that a desire to lose one's individuality and find identity in the love of another is what quietly moves the events of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''. As the primary sense of motivation, this desire is reflected even in the scenery depictions and the story's overall mood.{{sfn|Marshall|1982}}

===Ambiguous sexuality===
[[File:Johann Heinrich Füssli 007.jpg|thumb|left|''The Awakening of the Fairy Queen Titania'']]
In his essay &quot;Preposterous Pleasures: Queer Theories and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;,'' Douglas E. Green explores possible interpretations of alternative sexuality that he finds within the text of the play, in juxtaposition to the proscribed social mores of the culture at the time the play was written. He writes that his essay &quot;does not (seek to) rewrite ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' as a gay play but rather explores some of its 'homoerotic significations'&amp;nbsp;... moments of 'queer' disruption and eruption in this Shakespearean comedy.&quot;{{sfn|Green|1998|p=370}}

Green does not consider Shakespeare to have been a &quot;sexual radical&quot;, but that the play represented a &quot;topsy-turvy world&quot; or &quot;temporary holiday&quot; that mediates or negotiates the &quot;discontents of civilisation&quot;, which while resolved neatly in the story's conclusion, do not resolve so neatly in real life.{{sfn|Green|1998|p=375}} Green writes that the &quot;sodomitical elements&quot;, &quot;[[homoeroticism]]&quot;, &quot;lesbianism&quot;, and even &quot;compulsory heterosexuality&quot;—the first hint of which may be Oberon's obsession with Titania's changeling ward—in the story must be considered in the context of the &quot;culture of early modern England&quot; as a commentary on the &quot;aesthetic rigidities of comic form and political ideologies of the prevailing order&quot;.{{sfn|Green|1998|p=375}} Aspects of ambiguous sexuality and gender conflict in the story are also addressed in essays by Shirley Garner and William W.E. Slights albeit all the characters are played by males.{{sfn|Garner|1998|pp=129–30}}{{sfn|Slights|1988|p=261}}

===Feminism===
[[File:Edward Robert Hughes - Midsummer Eve (1908c).jpg|thumb|upright|''Midsummer Eve'' by [[Edward Robert Hughes]] c. 1908]]
Male dominance is one thematic element found in the play. In ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', Lysander and Hermia escape into the woods for a night where they do not fall under the laws of Theseus or Egeus. Upon their arrival in Athens, the couples are married. Marriage is seen as the ultimate social achievement for women while men can go on to do many other great things and gain social recognition.{{sfn|Howard|2003|p=414}} In ''The Imperial Votaress'', Louis Montrose draws attention to male and female gender roles and norms present in the comedy in connection with Elizabethan culture. In reference to the triple wedding, he says, &quot;The festive conclusion in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' depends upon the success of a process by which the feminine pride and power manifested in Amazon warriors, possessive mothers, unruly wives, and wilful daughters are brought under the control of lords and husbands.&quot;{{sfn|Montrose|2000|p=65}} He says that the consummation of marriage is how power over a woman changes hands from father to husband. A connection is drawn between flowers and sexuality. Montrose sees the juice employed by Oberon as symbolising menstrual blood as well as the &quot;sexual blood shed by 'virgins'&quot;. While blood as a result of menstruation is representative of a woman's power, blood as a result of a first sexual encounter represents man's power over women.{{sfn|Montrose|2000|pp=61–69}}

There are points in the play, however, when there is an absence of patriarchal control. In his book ''Power on Display'', Leonard Tennenhouse says the problem in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' is the problem of &quot;authority gone archaic&quot;.{{sfn|Tennenhouse|1986|p=73}} The Athenian law requiring a daughter to die if she does not do her father's will is outdated. Tennenhouse contrasts the patriarchal rule of Theseus in Athens with that of Oberon in the carnivalistic Faerie world. The disorder in the land of the fairies completely opposes the world of Athens. He states that during times of carnival and festival, male power is broken down. For example, what happens to the four lovers in the woods as well as Bottom's dream represents chaos that contrasts with Theseus' political order. However, Theseus does not punish the lovers for their disobedience. According to Tennenhouse, by forgiving the lovers, he has made a distinction between the law of the patriarch (Egeus) and that of the monarch (Theseus), creating two different voices of authority. This can be compared to the time of [[Elizabeth I]], in which monarchs were seen as having two bodies: the body natural and the body politic. Tennenhouse says that Elizabeth's succession itself represented both the voice of a patriarch and the voice of a monarch: (1) her father's will, which stated that the crown should pass to her and (2) the fact that she was the daughter of a king.{{sfn|Tennenhouse|1986|Pp=74–76}}

==Criticism and interpretation==
===Critical history===
====17th century====
[[File:Samuel Pepys.jpg|thumb|right|[[Samuel Pepys]], who wrote the oldest known comments on the play, found ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' to be &quot;the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}]]
Dorothea Kehler has attempted to trace the criticism of the work through the centuries. The earliest such piece of criticism that she found was a 1662 entry in the diary of [[Samuel Pepys]]. He found the play to be &quot;the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} He did, however, admit that it had &quot;some good dancing and some handsome women, which was all my pleasure&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}

The next critic known to comment on the play was [[John Dryden]], writing in 1677. He was preoccupied with the question of whether [[Fairy|fairies]] should be depicted in theatrical plays, since they did not exist. He concluded that poets should be allowed to depict things which do not exist but derive from [[popular belief]]. And fairies are of this sort, as are [[Pygmy (Greek mythology)|pigmies]] and the extraordinary effects of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Based on this reasoning, Dryden defended the merits of three fantasy plays: ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', ''[[The Tempest]]'', and [[Ben Jonson|Ben Jonson's]] ''[[The Masque of Queens|Masque of Witches]]''.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}

====18th century====
[[Charles Gildon]] in the early 18th century recommended this play for its beautiful reflections, descriptions, similes, and topics. Gildon thought that Shakespeare drew inspiration from the works of [[Ovid]] and [[Virgil]], and that he could read them in the original [[Latin]] and not in later translations.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}

[[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]], writing in the 1770s, also recommended this play. He felt the depiction of the supernatural was among Shakespeare's strengths, not weaknesses. He especially praised the poetry and wit of the fairies, and the quality of the verse involved.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} His contemporary [[Francis Gentleman]], an admirer of Shakespeare, was much less appreciative of this play. He felt that the poetry, the characterisation, and the originality of the play were its strengths, but that its major weaknesses were a &quot;puerile&quot; plot and that it consists of an odd mixture of incidents. The connection of the incidents to each other seemed rather forced to Gentleman.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=6–7}}

[[Edmond Malone]], a Shakespearean scholar and critic of the late 18th century, found another supposed flaw in this particular play, its lack of a proper [[decorum]]. He found that the &quot;more exalted characters&quot; (the aristocrats of Athens) are subservient to the interests of those beneath them. In other words, the lower-class characters play larger roles than their betters and overshadow them. He found this to be a grave error of the writer. Malone thought that this play had to be an early and immature work of Shakespeare and, by implication, that an older writer would know better. Malone's main argument seems to derive from the [[Class discrimination|classism]] of his era. He assumes that the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] had to receive more attention in the narrative and to be more important, more distinguished, and better than the lower class.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}}

====19th century====
[[Image:William Hazlitt self-portrait (1802).jpg|thumb|right|[[William Hazlitt]] preferred reading ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' over watching it acted on stage.]]
According to Kehler, significant 19th-century criticism began in 1808 with [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]]. Schlegel perceived unity in the multiple plot lines. He noted that the donkey's head is not a random transformation, but reflects Bottom's true nature. He identified the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe as a [[burlesque]] of the Athenian lovers.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}} In 1817, [[William Hazlitt]] found the play to be better as a written work than a staged production. He found the work to be &quot;a delightful fiction&quot;{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}} but when staged, it is reduced to a dull [[pantomime]]. He concluded that poetry and the stage do not fit together.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}} Kehler finds the comment to be more of an indication of the quality of the theatrical productions available to Hazlitt, rather than a true indication of the play's supposed unsuitability to the stage. She notes that prior to the 1840s, all stage productions of this play were adaptations unfaithful to the original text.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=7}}

In 1811–1812, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] made two points of criticism about this play. The first was that the entire play should be seen as a [[dream]]. Second, that Helena is guilty of &quot;ungrateful treachery&quot; to Hermia. He thought that this was a reflection of the lack of [[principle]]s in women, who are more likely to follow their own passions and inclinations than men. Women, in his view, feel less abhorrence for moral [[evil]], though they are concerned with its outward consequences. Coleridge was probably the earliest critic to introduce [[gender]] issues to the analysis of this play. Kehler dismisses his views on Helena as indications of Coleridge's own [[misogyny]], rather than genuine reflections of Helena's morality.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=7–8}}

[[File:Augustins - La Folie de Titania - Paul Jean Gervais 1897 2004 1 188.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Maginn]] thought Bottom a lucky man and was particularly amused that he treats Titania, the Queen of the Fairies, &quot;as carelessly as if she were the wench of the next-door tapster&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}}]]
In 1837, [[William Maginn]] produced essays on the play. He turned his attention to Theseus' speech about &quot;the lunatic, the lover, and the poet&quot;{{efn|Theseus' &quot;The lunatic, the lover, and the poet&quot; speech is in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' V.I.2–22.&lt;ref&gt;''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' V.I.2–22.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and to Hippolyta's response to it. He regarded Theseus as the voice of Shakespeare himself and the speech as a call for imaginative audiences. He also viewed Bottom as a lucky man on whom [[Fortuna|Fortune]] showered favours beyond measure. He was particularly amused by the way Bottom reacts to the love of the [[Titania|fairy queen]]: completely unfazed. Maginn argued that &quot;Theseus would have bent in reverent awe before Titania. Bottom treats her as carelessly as if she were the wench of the next-door tapster.&quot;{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}} Finally, Maginn thought that Oberon should not be blamed for Titania's humiliation, which is the result of an accident. He viewed Oberon as angry with the &quot;caprices&quot;{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}} of his queen, but unable to anticipate that her charmed affections would be reserved for a weaver with a donkey's head.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}}

In 1839, the philosopher [[Hermann Ulrici]] wrote that the play and its depiction of human life reflected the views of [[Platonism]]. In his view, Shakespeare implied that human life is nothing but a dream, suggesting influence from [[Plato]] and his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence. Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave here, like ordinary people. He agreed with Malone that this did not fit their stations in life, but viewed this behaviour as an indication of [[parody]] about class differences.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=8}}

[[James Halliwell-Phillipps]], writing in the 1840s, found that there were many inconsistencies in the play, but considered it the most beautiful poetical drama ever written.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}

In 1849, [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]] also wrote about the play and its apparent lack of proper [[social stratification]]. He thought that this play indicated Shakespeare's maturity as a playwright, and that its &quot;Thesean harmony&quot;{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} reflects proper decorum of character. He also viewed Bottom as the best-drawn character, with his self-confidence, authority, and self-love. He argued that Bottom stands as a representative of the whole human race. Like Hazlitt he felt that the work is best appreciated when read as a text, rather than acted on stage. He found the writing to be &quot;subtle and ethereal&quot;, and standing above [[literary criticism]] and its reductive reasoning.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=8–9}}

[[File:Lysander declaring his passion to Helena (Smirke, c. 1820-1825).jpg|thumb|right|[[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]] thought Hermia lacking in [[filial piety]] and devoid of conscience for running away with Lysander, himself not a shining beacon of virtue (here seen wooing Helena).{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}]]
Also in 1849, [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]] wrote extensively about the play. He denied the theory that this play should be seen as a dream. He argued that it should be seen as an ethical construct and an [[allegory]]. He thought that it was an allegorical depiction of the errors of sensual love, which is likened to a dream. In his view, Hermia lacks in [[Filial piety|filial obedience]] and acts as if devoid of conscience when she runs away with Lysander. Lysander is also guilty for disobeying and mocking his prospective father-in-law. Pyramus and Thisbe also lack in filial obedience, since they &quot;woo by moonlight&quot;{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} behind their parents' backs. The fairies, in his view, should be seen as &quot;personified dream gods&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} They represent the caprices of superficial love, and they lack in intellect, feeling, and ethics.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}

Gervinus also wrote on where the [[fairyland]] of the play is located. Not in [[Attica]], but in the [[Indies]]. His views on the Indies seem to Kehler to be influenced by [[Orientalism]]. He speaks of the Indies as scented with the [[odour|aroma]] of flowers and as the place where mortals live in the state of a half-dream. Gervinus denies and devalues the loyalty of Titania to her friend. He views this supposed friendship as not grounded in spiritual association. Titania merely &quot;delight in her beauty, her 'swimming gait,' and her powers of imitation&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} Gervinus further views Titania as an immoral character for not trying to reconcile with her husband. In her resentment, Titania seeks separation from him, which Gervinus blames her for.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}

Gervinus wrote with elitist disdain about the mechanicals of the play and their acting aspirations. He described them as homely creatures with &quot;hard hands and thick heads&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}} They are, in his view, ignorant men who compose and act in plays merely for financial reward. They are not real artists. Gervinus reserves his praise and respect only for Theseus, who he thinks represents the intellectual man. Like several of his predecessors, Gervinus thought that this work should be read as a text and not acted on stage.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=9}}

[[File:Charles Cowden Clarke.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles Cowden Clarke]] appreciated the [[Mechanical (character)|mechanicals]], and in particular found [[Nick Bottom]] conceited but good-natured and imaginative.]]
In 1863, [[Charles Cowden Clarke]] also wrote on this play. Kehler notes he was the husband of famous Shakespearean scholar [[Mary Cowden Clarke]]. Charles was more appreciative of the lower-class mechanicals of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their collective richness of character. He thought that Bottom was conceited but good natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with the representatives of the fairy world. He also argued that Bottom's conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=9–10}}

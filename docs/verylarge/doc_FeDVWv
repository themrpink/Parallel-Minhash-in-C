In its IRS Form 990 for Tax Year 2015, dated October 26, 2017, Focus on the Family for the first time declared itself a &quot;church, convention of churches or association of churches&quot;,  claiming that it was no longer required to file the IRS disclosure form and that the sources and disposition of its $89 million budget were &quot;Not for public inspection.&quot; Tax Attorney Gail Harmon, who advises nonprofit organisations on tax law, said she found the declaration &quot;shocking&quot;, noting that &quot;There’s nothing about them that meets the traditional definition of what a church is.

James Dobson cited the research of [[Kyle Pruett]] and [[Carol Gilligan]] in a ''Time Magazine'' guest article in the service of a claim that two women cannot raise a child; upon finding out that her work had been used in this way, Gilligan wrote a letter to Dobson asking him to apologize and to cease and desist from citing her work, describing herself as &quot;mortified to learn that you had distorted my work...Not only did you take my research out of context, you did so without my knowledge to support discriminatory goals that I do not agree with...there is nothing in my research that would lead you to draw the stated conclusions you did in the ''Time'' article.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ci=108&amp;ch=news&amp;sc=glbt&amp;sc2=news&amp;sc3=&amp;id=16911 |work=Edge Boston |date=December 15, 2006 |title=James Dobson Slammed for Distorting Facts on Gay Families in Time Magazine |access-date=September 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130231527/http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ci=108&amp;ch=news&amp;sc=glbt&amp;sc2=news&amp;sc3=&amp;id=16911 |archive-date=January 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truth Wins Out: [http://www.truthwinsout.org/pressrelease/2006/12/37/ James Dobson Slammed By Professor For Distorting Her Research In Time Magazine Article On Mary Cheney’s Pregnancy.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115140123/http://www.truthwinsout.org/pressrelease/2006/12/37/ |date=January 15, 2013 }}  &quot;[A] letter to Dobson, obtained exclusively by Truth Wins Out,&quot; December 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OLeary&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:NHRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=11AA3D8CECB1E500&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46 | title=Yale expert says group misused his words | newspaper=[[New Haven Register]] | date=February 12, 2007 | accessdate=November 12, 2013 | author=O' Leary, Mary E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pruett wrote a similar letter, in which he said that Dobson &quot;cherry-picked a phrase to shore up highly (in my view) discriminatory purposes.

===Football advertisements===
In 2010, Focus on the Family bought ad time during [[Super Bowl XLIV]] to air a commercial featuring [[Heisman Trophy]] winning [[Florida Gators football|Florida Gators]] [[quarterback]] [[Tim Tebow]] and his mother, Pam. In the ad, Pam described Tim as a &quot;miracle baby&quot; who &quot;almost didn't make it into this world&quot;, and further elaborated that &quot;with all our family's been through, we have to be tough&quot; (after which Pam was promptly tackled by Tim). The ad directed viewers to the organization's website.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes-tebowhype&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Tebow ad falls short of the hype|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/08/nation/la-na-tebow-abortion8-2010feb08|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=January 19, 2014|first=Robin|last=Abcarian|date=February 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221051659/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/08/nation/la-na-tebow-abortion8-2010feb08|archive-date=February 21, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;slate-tebowad&quot;/&gt;

Women's rights groups asked CBS not to air the then-unseen ad, arguing that it was divisive.

If there is any ostentatious or corrupt influence here, it is nowhere in sight.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ott2&quot;/&gt;

While visiting the Focus on the Family complex, a couple had asked the staff if handling the sightseers in the main building was a distraction. The staff told the couple that it was a distraction; afterwards the couple donated $4&amp;nbsp;million to have a welcome center built. A visiting family donated {{convert|7|mi|km}} of wood trim from the family's Pennsylvania lumber business so FOTF could build its administration building. As of 1998, James Dobson, in his welcome center film, compares his decision to build the headquarters in Colorado Springs to the founding of the [[temple in Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ott2&quot;/&gt;

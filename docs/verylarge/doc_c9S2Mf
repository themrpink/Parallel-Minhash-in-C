He directed ''[[Adelchi]]'', a lesser-known work by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]. Gassman brought this production to half a million spectators, crossing Italy with his ''Teatro Popolare Itinerante'' (a newer edition of the famous ''[[Carro di Tespi]]''). His productions have included many of the famous authors and playwrights of the 20th century, with repeated returns to the classics of Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky and the Greek tragicians. He also founded a theatre school in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]] ([[Bottega Teatrale di Firenze]]), which educated many of the more talented actors of the current generation of Italian thespians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Markon.net srl |url=http://www.vittoriogassman.it/biografia.htm |title=Vittorio Gassman - Sito ufficiale |publisher=Vittoriogassman.it |access-date=2014-05-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503165619/http://www.vittoriogassman.it/biografia.htm |archive-date=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinema, he worked frequently both in Italy and abroad. He met and fell in love with American actress [[Shelley Winters]] while she was touring Europe with fiancé [[Farley Granger]]. When Winters was forced to return to Hollywood to fulfill contractual obligations, he followed her there and married her. With his natural charisma and his fluency in English he scored a number of roles in Hollywood, including ''[[Rhapsody (1954 film)|Rhapsody]]'' with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and ''[[The Glass Wall]]'' before returning to Italy and the theatre.

In the 1990s he took part in the popular [[Rai 3]] TV show ''[[Tunnel (TV show)|Tunnel]]'' in which he very formally and &quot;seriously&quot;' recited documents such as utility bills, yellow pages and similar trivial texts, such as washing instructions for a wool sweater or cookies ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casaitaliananyu.org/content/theatre |title=Theatre &amp;#124; Casa Italiana Zerilli / Marimò |publisher=Casaitaliananyu.org |access-date=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rendered them with the same professional skill that made him famous while reciting [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''Divine Comedy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encinematheque.net/acteurs/H35/index.asp |title=Vittorio GASSMAN |publisher=Encinematheque.net |access-date=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Markon.net srl |url=http://www.vittoriogassman.it/biografia.htm |title=Vittorio Gassman - Sito ufficiale |publisher=Vittoriogassman.it |access-date=2014-05-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503165619/http://www.vittoriogassman.it/biografia.htm |archive-date=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Gassman voiced [[Mufasa]] in the Italian dubbed version of ''[[The Lion King]]''. Gassman’s voice was redubbed in several of his films by historical Italian actors and dubbers which include [[Emilio Cigoli]], [[Sandro Ruffini]], [[Gualtiero De Angelis]], [[Stefano Sibaldi]], [[Enrico Maria Salerno]] and [[Pino Locchi]].

===Personal life===
Gassman married three times, all to actresses: [[Nora Ricci]] (with whom he had Paola, an actress and wife of [[Ugo Pagliai]]); [[Shelley Winters]] (mother of his daughter Vittoria); and Diletta D'Andrea (mother of his son Jacopo).

While rehearsing ''Hamlet'', he began an affair with [[Anna Maria Ferrero]], his 16-year-old [[Ophelia]], which ended his marriage to Winters. He and Winters were forced to work together on ''[[Mambo (1954 film)|Mambo]]'' just as their marriage was unraveling, providing fodder for tabloids all over the world.

From 1964–1968 he was the partner of French actress [[Juliette Mayniel]] (mother of his son [[Alessandro Gassman|Alessandro]], also an actor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vittorio Gassman |url=http://trovacinema.repubblica.it/attori-registi/vittorio-gassman/181244 |title=La schema di Vittorio Gassman.

==Death==
In the later stages of his life, Gassman suffered from [[bipolar disorder]] and on 29 June 2000, Gassman died of a [[heart attack]] in his sleep at his home in Rome at the age of 77.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/30/movies/vittorio-gassman-77-veteran-italian-star-comfortable-in-classics-and-comedy-dies.html Vittorio Gassman, 77, Veteran Italian Star Comfortable in Classics and Comedy, Dies]&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Campo Verano]].

'''Electroconvulsive therapy''' ('''ECT'''), formerly known as '''electroshock therapy''', is a [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] treatment in which [[seizure]]s in the brain (without muscular [[convulsion]]s) are electrically induced in patients to provide relief from [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=Rudorfer/&gt; Typically, 70 to 120 [[volt]]s are applied externally to the patient's head resulting in approximately 800 [[amperes|milliamperes]] of direct current passed through the brain, for 100 [[millisecond]]s to 6 seconds duration, either from temple to temple (bilateral ECT) or from front to back of one side of the head (unilateral ECT).

The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 by Italian psychiatrist [[Ugo Cerletti]]&lt;ref&gt;Rudorfer, M. V., Henry, M. E., &amp; Sackheim, H. A. (1997). Electroconvulsive therapy. In A. Tasman, J. &amp; J. A Lieberman (Eds.), Psychiatry (1535-1556)&lt;/ref&gt; and rapidly replaced less safe and effective forms of [[Shock therapy (psychiatry)|biological treatments]] in use at the time. ECT is often used with [[informed consent]]&lt;ref name =Beloucif&gt;{{cite journal | author = Beloucif S | year = 2013 | title = Informed consent for special procedures: electroconvulsive therapy and psychosurgery | journal = Curr Opin Anesthesiol | volume =  26| issue = 2| pages =  182–5| doi = 10.1097/ACO.0b013e32835e7380 | pmid = 23385317 | s2cid = 36643014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a safe and effective intervention for [[major depressive disorder]], [[mania]], and [[catatonia]].&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev&gt;FDA.

ECT is the most effective treatment that currently exists for depression.

A usual course of ECT involves multiple administrations, typically given two or three times per week until the patient is no longer suffering symptoms. ECT is administered under anesthesia with a [[muscle relaxant]].&lt;ref&gt;Margarita Tartakovsky (2012) Psych Central. [http://psychcentral.com/lib/5-outdated-beliefs-about-ect/00011255 5 Outdated Beliefs About ECT]&lt;/ref&gt; ECT can differ in its application in three ways: electrode placement, treatment frequency, and the electrical waveform of the stimulus. These treatment parameters can pose significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission in the treated patient.

Placement can be bilateral, where the electric current is passed from one side of the brain to the other, or unilateral, in which the current is solely passed across one [[Brain hemisphere|hemisphere]] of the brain. Bilateral electrode placement seems to have greater effectiveness than unilateral electrode placement, but also carries a higher risk of memory loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dr.Jamal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Read 333–47&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Read|first=J|author2=Bentall, R|title=The effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy: a literature review|journal=Epidemiologia e Psichiatria Sociale|date=Oct–Dec 2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=333–47|pmid=21322506|url=http://www.power2u.org/downloads/1012-ReadBentallECT.pdf|doi=10.1017/S1121189X00000671|access-date=2012-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053142/http://www.power2u.org/downloads/1012-ReadBentallECT.pdf|archive-date=2012-05-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued and some patients will continue to receive maintenance ECT treatments.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt;

== Medical use ==
ECT is used with [[informed consent]]&lt;ref name =Beloucif/&gt; in treatment-resistant [[major depressive disorder]], treatment-resistant [[catatonia]], prolonged or severe [[mania]], and in conditions where &quot;there is a need for rapid, definitive response because of the severity of a psychiatric or medical condition (e.g., when illness is characterized by [[stupor]], marked [[psychomotor retardation]], depressive [[delusion]]s or [[hallucination]]s, or life-threatening physical exhaustion associated with mania).&quot;&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;who.int&quot;&gt;World Health Organisation (2005).

Geneva, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major depressive disorder===
For major depressive disorder, ECT is generally used only when other treatments have failed, or in emergencies, such as imminent suicide.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.mja.com.au/open/2012/1/4/non-pharmacological-biological-treatment-approaches-difficult-treat-depression|pmid=25370288|year=2013|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=P.

====Efficacy====
A [[meta-analysis]] on the effectiveness of ECT in unipolar and [[bipolar depression]] was conducted in 2012. Results indicated that although patients with [[unipolar depression]] and bipolar depression responded to other medical treatments very differently, both groups responded equally well to ECT. Overall remission rate for patients given a round of ECT treatment was 50.9% for those with unipolar depression and 53.2% for those with bipolar depression. The severity of each patient's depression was assessed at the same baseline in each group.&lt;ref name=Dierckx/&gt;

There is little agreement on the most appropriate follow-up to ECT for people with major depressive disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jelovac2013Rev&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jelovac A, etal|date=Nov 2013|title=Relapse following successful electroconvulsive therapy for major depression: a meta-analysis|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=38|issue=12|pages=2467–74|doi=10.1038/npp.2013.149|pmc=3799066|pmid=23774532}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When ECT is followed by treatment with [[antidepressants]], about 50% of people relapsed by 12 months following successful initial treatment with ECT, with about 37% relapsing within the first 6 months.  About twice as many relapsed with no antidepressants.  Most of the evidence for continuation therapy is with [[tricyclic antidepressants]]; evidence for relapse prevention with newer antidepressants is lacking.&lt;ref name=Jelovac2013Rev/&gt;

In 2004, a meta-analytic review paper found in terms of efficacy, &quot;a significant superiority of ECT in all comparisons: ECT versus simulated ECT, ECT versus [[placebo]], ECT versus antidepressants in general, ECT versus tricyclics and ECT versus [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15087991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagnin D, de Queiroz V, Pini S, Cassano GB | title = Efficacy of ECT in depression: a meta-analytic review | journal = The Journal of ECT | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–20 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15087991 | doi = 10.1097/00124509-200403000-00004| s2cid = 25843283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, The UK ECT Review Group published a [[systematic review]] and meta-analysis comparing ECT to placebo and antidepressant drugs. This meta-analysis demonstrated a large effect size (high efficacy relative to the mean in terms of the [[standard deviation]]) for ECT versus placebo, and versus antidepressant drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=UK ECT Review Group |title=Efficacy and safety of electroconvulsive therapy in depressive disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=The Lancet|volume=361 |issue=9360 |pages=799–808 |year=2003 |pmid=12642045 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12705-5|s2cid=28964580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with [[repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (rTMS) for people with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, ECT relieves depression as shown by reducing the score on the [[Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression]] by about 15 points, while rTMS reduced it by 9 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Micallef-Trigona B | year = 2014 | title = Comparing the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy in the treatment of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Depress Res Treat | volume = 2014 | page = 135049 | pmid = 25143831 | doi=10.1155/2014/135049 | pmc=4131106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catatonia===
ECT is generally a second-line treatment for people with [[catatonia]] who do not respond to other treatments, but is a first-line treatment for severe or life-threatening catatonia.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=catatoniaRev&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sienaert P, etal | date = Dec 2014 | title = A clinical review of the treatment of catatonia | journal = Front Psychiatry | volume = 5 | page = 181 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyt.2014.00181 | pmid = 25538636 | pmc=4260674}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Leroy|first1=Arnaud|last2=Naudet|first2=Florian|last3=Vaiva|first3=Guillaume|last4=Francis|first4=Andrew|last5=Thomas|first5=Pierre|last6=Amad|first6=Ali|title=Is electroconvulsive therapy an evidence-based treatment for catatonia?

===Mania===
ECT is used to treat people who have severe or prolonged [[mania]];&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt; [[NICE]] recommends it only in life-threatening situations or when other treatments have failed&lt;ref name=NICEtech2003&gt;NICE [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta59 Guidance on the use of electroconvulsive therapy.

===Schizophrenia===
ECT is widely used worldwide in the treatment of [[schizophrenia]], but in North America and Western Europe it is invariably used only in [[treatment resistant schizophrenia]] when symptoms show little response to [[antipsychotic]]s; there is comprehensive research evidence for such practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tharyan P, Adams CE |title=Electroconvulsive therapy for schizophrenia |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue=2 |year=2005 |pmid=15846598  |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000076.pub2  |pages=CD000076 |veditors=Tharyan P}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is useful in the case of severe exacerbations of [[catatonic schizophrenia]], whether excited or stuporous.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=NICEtech2003/&gt;

==Effects==
Aside from effects in the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief [[general anesthesia]]; the [[U.S. Surgeon General]]'s report says that there are &quot;no absolute health [[contraindications]]&quot; to its use.&lt;ref name=&quot;SG&quot;/&gt;{{rp|259}} Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and memory loss. Some patients experience [[Myalgia|muscle soreness]] after ECT.  The death rate during ECT is around 4 per 100,000 procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Gelder, M., Mayou, R., Geddes, J. (2006) Psychiatry. 3rd edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence and rationale to support giving low doses of [[benzodiazepine]]s or otherwise low doses of [[general anesthetic]]s, which induce [[sedation]] but not [[anesthesia]], to patients to reduce adverse effects of ECT.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22531198&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gallegos J |title=Decreasing adverse outcomes of unmodified electroconvulsive therapy: suggestions and possibilities |journal=J ECT |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=77–81 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22531198 |doi=10.1097/YCT.0b013e3182359314 |author2= Vaidya P |author3= D'Agati D  |s2cid=6423840 |display-authors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are no absolute contraindications for ECT, there is increased risk for patients who have unstable or severe cardiovascular conditions or aneurysms; who have recently had a stroke; who have increased [[intracranial pressure]] (for instance, due to a solid brain tumor), or who have severe pulmonary conditions, or who are generally at high risk for receiving anesthesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;APA2001guideline&quot;/&gt;{{rp|30}}

The acute effects of ECT can include [[amnesia]], both retrograde (for events occurring before the treatment) and anterograde (for events occurring after the treatment).&lt;ref name=&quot;Benbow&quot;&gt;Benbow, SM (2004) &quot;Adverse effects of ECT&quot;.

The use of either constant or pulsing electrical impulses also varied the memory loss results in patients. Patients who received pulsing electrical impulses, as opposed to a steady flow, seemed to incur less memory loss. The vast majority of modern treatment uses brief pulse currents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benbow&quot;/&gt;

Retrograde amnesia is most marked for events occurring in the weeks or months before treatment, with one study showing that although some people lose memories from years prior to treatment, recovery of such memories was &quot;virtually complete&quot; by seven months post-treatment, with the only enduring loss being memories in the weeks and months prior to the treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Squire&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Squire LR, Slater PC, Miller PL |title=Retrograde amnesia and bilateral electroconvulsive therapy.

===Effects on brain structure===
Considerable controversy exists over the effects of ECT on brain tissue, although a number of mental health associations—including the APA—have concluded that there is no evidence that ECT causes structural brain damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;APA2001guideline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=NICE2009/&gt; A 1999 report by the U.S. Surgeon General states: &quot;The fears that ECT causes gross structural brain pathology have not been supported by decades of methodologically sound research in both humans and animals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;surgeon&quot;/&gt;

Many expert proponents of ECT maintain that the procedure is safe and does not cause brain damage. Dr. Charles Kellner, a prominent ECT researcher and former chief editor of the ''Journal of ECT'',  stated in a 2007 interview that, &quot;There are a number of well-designed studies that show ECT does not cause brain damage and numerous reports of patients who have received a large number of treatments over their lifetime and have suffered no significant problems due to ECT.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kellner interview&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sussman, M.D.|first=Norman|date=March 2007|title=In Session with Charles H. Kellner, MD: Current Developments in Electroconvulsive Therapy|url=http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1028|journal=Primary Psychiatry|volume=14|issue=3|pages=34–37|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Kellner cites a study purporting to show an absence of cognitive impairment in eight subjects after more than 100 lifetime ECT treatments.&lt;ref name=&quot;100 lifetime&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Devanand DP|author2=Sackeim HA|display-authors=etal|date=July 1991|title=Absence of cognitive impairment after more than 100 lifetime ECT treatments|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=148|issue=7|pages=929–32|doi=10.1176/ajp.148.7.929|pmid=2053635|author-link=Davangere Devanand}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Kellner stated &quot;Rather than cause brain damage, there is evidence that ECT may reverse some of the damaging effects of serious psychiatric illness.&quot;

===Effects in pregnancy===
If steps are taken to decrease potential risks, ECT is generally accepted to be relatively safe during all trimesters of pregnancy, particularly when compared to pharmacological treatments.&lt;ref name=Pompili2014Rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richards EM, Payne JL | date = Oct 2013 | title = The management of mood disorders in pregnancy: alternatives to antidepressants | journal = CNS Spectr | volume = 18 | issue = 5| pages = 261–71 | pmid = 23570692 | doi=10.1017/S1092852913000151| type = Submitted manuscript | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1235843 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested preparation for ECT during pregnancy includes a [[pelvic examination]], discontinuation of nonessential [[anticholinergic]] medication, uterine tocodynamometry, intravenous hydration, and administration of a nonparticulate [[antacid]]. During ECT, elevation of the pregnant woman's right hip, external fetal cardiac monitoring, [[intubation]], and avoidance of excessive [[hyperventilation]] are recommended.&lt;ref name=Pompili2014Rev/&gt;   In many instances of active mood disorder during pregnancy, the risks of untreated symptoms may outweigh the risks of ECT. Potential complications of ECT during pregnancy can be minimized by modifications in technique. The use of ECT during pregnancy requires thorough evaluation of the patient's capacity for informed consent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller1994&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Laura J.|title=Use of Electroconvulsive Therapy During Pregnancy|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=45|issue=5|year=1994|pages=444–450|issn=1075-2730|doi=10.1176/ps.45.5.444|pmid=8045538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on the heart===
ECT can cause a lack of blood flow and oxygen to the heart, [[heart arrhythmia]], and &quot;persistent [[asystole]]&quot;. Deaths, however, are very rare after ECT: 6 per 100,000 treatments. If they do occur, cardiovascular complications are considered as causal in about 30%.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid30557212&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Duma A, Maleczek M, Panjikaran B, Herkner H, Karrison T, Nagele P| title=Major Adverse Cardiac Events and Mortality Associated with Electroconvulsive Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. | journal=Anesthesiology | year= 2019 | volume= 130 | issue= 1 | pages= 83–91 | pmid=30557212 | doi=10.1097/ALN.0000000000002488 | pmc=6300062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the medical team performing the procedure typically consists of a psychiatrist, an anesthetist, an ECT treatment nurse or qualified assistant, and one or more recovery nurses.&lt;ref name=&quot;APA2001guideline&quot;/&gt;{{rp|109}} Medical trainees may assist, but only under the direct supervision of credentialed attending physicians and staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;APA2001guideline&quot;/&gt;{{rp|110}} The placement of electrodes, as well as the dose and duration of the stimulation is determined on a per-patient basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudorfer&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1881}}

In unilateral ECT, both electrodes are placed on the same side of the patient's head. Unilateral ECT may be used first to minimize side effects such as memory loss.

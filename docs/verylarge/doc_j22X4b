===Writing===
''Sesame Street'' has used many writers in its long history. As Peter Hellman wrote in his 1987 article in ''[[New York Magazine]]'', &quot;The show, of course, depends upon its writers, and it isn't easy to find adults who could identify the interest level of a pre-schooler&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hellman-52&quot;/&gt; Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. [[Norman Stiles]], head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would &quot;burn out&quot; after writing about a dozen scripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;hellman-52&quot;/&gt; According to Gikow, ''Sesame Street'' went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that it would be easier to teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-178&quot;&gt;Gikow, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; As Stone stated, &quot;Writing for children is not so easy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-178&quot;/&gt; Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, &quot;It's not an easy show to write. You have to know the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's research team developed an annotated document, or &quot;Writer's Notebook&quot;, which served as a bridge between the show's curriculum goals and script development.&lt;ref name=&quot;lesser-101&quot;&gt;Lesser, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The notebook was a compilation of programming ideas designed to teach specific curriculum points,&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; provided extended definitions of curriculum goals, and assisted the writers and producers in translating the goals into televised material.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Fisch in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions in the notebook were free of references to specific characters and contexts on the show so that they could be implemented as openly and flexibly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Fisch in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The research team, in a series of meetings with the writers, also developed &quot;a curriculum sheet&quot; that described the show's goals and priorities for each season. After receiving the curriculum focus and goals for the season, the writers met to discuss ideas and story arcs for the characters, and an &quot;assignment sheet&quot; was created that suggested how much time was allotted for each goal and topic.&lt;ref name=&quot;lesser-101&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lesser | first = Gerald S. |author2=Joel Schneider  |editor= Shalom M.

Early in their history ''Sesame Street'' and the CTW began to look for alternative funding sources and turned to creating products and writing licensing agreements. They became, as Cooney put it, &quot;a multiple-media institution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the CTW created a &quot;non-broadcast&quot; division responsible for creating and publishing books and ''[[Sesame Street Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch &amp; Truglio, pp. 197–198&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie&quot;/&gt;  The Workshop decided from the start that all materials their licensing program created would &quot;underscore and amplify&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-205&quot;&gt;Davis, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-195&quot;/&gt; the show's curriculum.

[[Jim Henson]], the creator of the Muppets, owned the [[trademark]]s to those characters, and was reluctant to market them at first. He agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, [[Sesame Street video games|computer games]], and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW and its outreach efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-203&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Cooney and the CTW had very little experience with marketing, they demanded complete control over all products and product decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-205&quot;/&gt; Any product line associated with the show had to be educational and inexpensive, and could not be advertised during the show's airings.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-204&quot;&gt;Davis, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; As Davis reported, &quot;Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution&quot; in their marketing and licensing efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-204&quot;/&gt;{{refn|According to ''Parade Magazine'' in 2019, 1 million children played with ''Sesame Street'' toys daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;wallace&quot;/&gt;|group=note}}

Director Jon Stone, talking about the music of ''Sesame Street'', said: &quot;There was no other sound like it on television&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in children's television, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; In order to attract the best composers and lyricists, the CTW allowed songwriters like [[Joe Raposo]], ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s first musical director, to retain the rights to the songs they wrote, which earned them lucrative profits and helped the show sustain public interest.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; By 2019, there were 180 albums of ''Sesame Street'' music produced, and its songwriters had received 11 [[Grammy Award|Grammys]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wallace&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie&quot;/&gt;  In late 2018, the SW announced a multi-year agreement with [[Warner Music Group]] to re-launch Sesame Street Records in the U.S. and Canada.  For the first time in 20 years, &quot;an extensive catalog of ''Sesame Street'' recordings&quot; was made available to the public in a variety of formats, including CD and vinyl compilations, digital streaming, and downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Warner Music Group Sesame Workshop Team up to Relaunch Sesame Street Records |url=https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/warner-music-group-and-sesame-workshop-team-up-to-relaunch-sesame-street-records/ |publisher=Music Business Worldwide |accessdate=18 July 2019 |date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sesame Street'' used animations and short films commissioned from outside studios,&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-236&quot;/&gt; interspersed throughout each episode, to help teach their viewers basic concepts like numbers and letters.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Henson was one of the many producers to create short films for the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-236&quot;&gt;Gikow, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after ''Sesame Street'' debuted in the United States, the CTW was approached independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the show at home. These versions came to be called &quot;co-productions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cole et al. in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of ''Sesame Street'',&lt;ref&gt;Cole et al. in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006, there were twenty co-productions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people = Knowlton, Linda Goldstein and Linda Hawkins Costigan (producers) | date = 2006 | title = The World According to Sesame Street | medium = documentary | publisher = Participant Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By its 50th anniversary in 2019, 190 million children viewed over 160 versions of ''Sesame Street'' in 70 languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;wallace&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leaving&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bradley |first1=Diana |title=Leaving the neighborhood: 'Sesame Street' muppets to travel across America next year |url=https://www.prweek.com/article/1489073/leaving-neighborhood-sesame-street-muppets-travel-across-america-next-year |website=PR Weekly |accessdate=July 9, 2019 |date=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for $96 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;carvajal&quot;/&gt;

Shortly after the CTW was created in 1968, Joan Ganz Cooney was named its first executive director. She was one of the first female executives in American television. Her appointment was called &quot;one of the most important television developments of the decade&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; She assembled a team of producers, all of whom had previously worked on ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]''. [[Jon Stone]] was responsible for writing, casting, and format; Dave Connell took over animation; and Sam Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Cameraman Frankie Biondo worked on ''Sesame Street'' from its first episode.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Henson and the Muppets' involvement in ''Sesame Street'' began when he and Cooney met at one of the curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should &quot;make do without puppets&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;finch-53&quot;/&gt; Henson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join ''Sesame Street'' to meet his own social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the ''Sesame Street'' Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the CTW.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-5&quot;/&gt; As Morrow stated, Henson's puppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Davis reported that Henson was able to take &quot;arcane academic goals&quot; and translate them to &quot;effective and pleasurable viewing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. Morrow reported that the Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were stereotypical and predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the producers decided against depending upon a single host for ''Sesame Street'', instead casting a group of ethnically diverse actors,&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; they realized that a children's television program needed to have, as Lesser put it, &quot;a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; both human and Muppet. Jon Stone, whose goal was to cast white actors in the minority,&lt;ref name=&quot;hellman-52&quot;/&gt; was responsible for hiring the show's first [[List of human Sesame Street characters|cast]]. He did not audition actors until Spring 1969, a few weeks before the five test shows were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the &quot;most enthusiastic thumbs up&quot; were cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borgenicht-15&quot;&gt;Borgenicht, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Loretta Long]] was chosen to play [[The Robinson family (Sesame Street)|Susan]] when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of &quot;[[I'm a Little Teapot]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borgenicht-15&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Stone stated that casting was the only aspect of the show that was &quot;just completely haphazard&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-195&quot;&gt;Davis, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the cast and crew found jobs on ''Sesame Street'' through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-195&quot; /&gt;  According to puppeteer [[Martin P. Robinson|Marty Robinson]] in 2019, longevity was common among the show's cast and crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie&quot;/&gt;

According to the CTW's research, children preferred watching and listening to other children more than to puppets and adults, so they included children in many scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Connell insisted that no child actors be used,&lt;ref name=&quot;morrow-84&quot;&gt;Morrow, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; so these children were non-professionals, unscripted, and spontaneous. Many of their reactions were unpredictable and difficult to control, but the adult [[List of human Sesame Street characters|cast]] learned to handle the children's spontaneity flexibly, even when it resulted in departures from the planned script or lesson.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;  CTW research also revealed that the children's hesitations and on-air mistakes served as models for viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morrow, this resulted in the show having a &quot;fresh quality&quot;, especially in its early years.&lt;ref name=&quot;morrow-84&quot;/&gt;

===Ratings===
When ''Sesame Street'' premiered in 1969, it aired on only 67.6% of American televisions, but it earned a 3.3 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] rating, which totaled 1.9 million households.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seligsohn&quot;&gt;Seligsohn, Leo.

Quoted in Davis, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; By the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of 6 were watching ''Sesame Street'' daily. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners and first- and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;zill-117&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Zill | first = Nicholas | title = &quot;G&quot; is for Growing: Thirty Years of Research on Children and Sesame Street | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Publishers | year = 2001 | location = Mahweh, New Jersey | pages = [https://archive.org/details/gisforgrowingthi00shal/page/117 117–120] | isbn = 0-8058-3395-1 | chapter = Does ''Sesame Street'' Enhance School Readiness?

Lesser believed that ''Sesame Street'' research &quot;may have conferred a new respectability upon the studies of the effects of visual media upon children&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lesser-235&quot;&gt;Lesser, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that the show had the same effect on the prestige of producing shows for children in the television industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;lesser-235&quot;/&gt; Historian Robert Morrow, in his book ''Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television'', which chronicled the show's influence on children's television and on the television industry as a whole, reported that many critics of commercial television saw ''Sesame Street'' as a &quot;straightforward illustration for reform&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;morrow-122&quot;&gt;Morrow, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Les Brown, a writer for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', saw in ''Sesame Street'' &quot;a hope for a more substantial future&quot; for television.&lt;ref name=&quot;morrow-122&quot;/&gt;

Morrow reported that the networks responded by creating more high-quality television programs, but that many critics saw them as &quot;appeasement gestures&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morrow, despite the CTW Model's effectiveness in creating a popular show, commercial television &quot;made only a limited effort to emulate CTW's methods&quot;, and did not use a curriculum or evaluate what children learned from them.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s commercial television had abandoned their experiments with creating better children's programming.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics hoped that ''Sesame Street'', with its depiction of a functioning, multicultural community, would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the mid-1990s that another children's television educational program, ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', used the CTW's methods to create and modify their content. The creators of ''Blue's Clues'' were influenced by ''Sesame Street'', but wanted to use research conducted in the 30 years since its debut. Angela Santomero, one of its producers, said, &quot;We wanted to learn from ''Sesame Street'' and take it one step further&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Richard Roeper]] said that perhaps one of the strongest indicators of the influence of ''Sesame Street'' has been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, especially speculation concerning the sexuality of [[Bert and Ernie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roeper | first = Richard | title = Hollywood Urban Legends: The Truth Behind All Those Delightfully Persistent Myths of Film, Television and Music | year = 2001 | publisher = Career Press | location = Franklin Lakes, New Jersey | isbn = 1-56414-554-9 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/hollywoodurbanle00rich/page/48 48–53] | url = https://archive.org/details/hollywoodurbanle00rich/page/48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45566451|title=Bert and Ernie sexuality debate rages|date=September 18, 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=October 16, 2019|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sesame Street'' was praised from its debut in 1969. ''Newsday'' reported that several newspapers and magazines had written &quot;glowing&quot; reports about the CTW and Cooney.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seligsohn&quot;/&gt; The press overwhelmingly praised the new show; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, ''Sesame Street'' won twenty awards, including a [[Peabody Award]], three Emmys, an award from the [[Public Relations Society of America]], a [[Clio Awards|Clio]], and a Prix Jeunesse.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; By 1995, the show had won two Peabody Awards and four [[Parents' Choice Award]]s. In addition, it was the subject of retrospectives at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allshow&quot;/&gt;

''Sesame Street'' was not without its detractors, however. The state commission in [[Mississippi]], where Henson was from, operated the state's PBS [[Mississippi Public Broadcasting|member station]]; in May 1970 it voted to not air ''Sesame Street'' because of its &quot;highly [racially] integrated cast of children&quot; which &quot;the commission members felt ...

Morrow speculated that much of the early criticism, which he called &quot;surprisingly intense&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;morrow-3&quot;&gt;Morrow, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to, as he put it, &quot;the place of children in American society and the controversies about television's effects on them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;morrow-3&quot;/&gt;

According to Morrow, the &quot;most important&quot; studies finding negative effects of ''Sesame Street'' were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist [[Thomas D. Cook]] during its first two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientist and [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] founder [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]] criticized the show for being too wholesome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kanfer | first = Stefan | title = Who's Afraid of Big, Bad TV? | work = Time | date = November 23, 1970 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943327,00.html?iid=digg_share | accessdate = October 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Leon Eisenberg]] saw ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s urban setting as &quot;superficial&quot; and having little to do with the problems confronted by the inner-city child.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Head Start director [[Edward Zigler]] was probably ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s most vocal critic in the show's early years.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of their commitment to multiculturalism, the CTW experienced conflicts with the leadership of minority groups, especially Latino groups and feminists, who objected to ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s depiction of Latinos and women.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; The CTW took steps to address their objections. By 1971, the CTW hired Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers, and by the mid-1970s, Morrow reported that &quot;the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; As ''The New York Times'' has stated, creating strong female characters &quot;that make kids laugh, but not...as female stereotypes&quot; has been a challenge for the producers of ''Sesame Street''.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morrow, change regarding how women and girls were depicted on ''Sesame Street'' occurred slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; As more female Muppet performers like [[Camille Bonora]], [[Fran Brill]], [[Pam Arciero]], [[Carmen Osbahr]], [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]], [[Jennifer Barnhart]], and [[Leslie Carrara-Rudolph]] were hired and trained, stronger female characters like [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]] and [[Abby Cadabby]] were created.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Olivera |first1=Monica |title=Carmen Osbahr, the talented puppeteer behind Sesame Street’s &quot;Rosita&quot; |url=http://nbclatino.com/2013/09/20/sesame-streets-rosita-latina-puppeteer-makes-a-difference/ |accessdate=October 17, 2019 |work=NBC Universal |date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Noordoostpolder by Sentinel-2, 2018-06-30.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Satellite imagery|Satellite image]] of [[Noordoostpolder]], the [[Netherlands]] (595.41&amp;nbsp;km²)]]
A '''polder''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈpɔldər|-|Nl-polder.ogg}})  is a low-lying tract of land that forms an artificial [[hydrology|hydrological]] entity, enclosed by embankments known as [[levee|dikes]]. The three types of polder are:

# [[Land reclamation|Land reclaimed]] from a body of water, such as a lake or the [[seabed]]
# [[Floodplain|Flood plains]] separated from the sea or river by a dike
# [[Marsh|Marshes]] separated from the surrounding water by a dike and subsequently drained; these are also known as ''[[koog|koogs]]'', especially in Germany

The ground level in drained marshes [[subsidence|subsides]] over time. All polders will eventually be below the surrounding water level some or all of the time. Water enters the low-lying polder through [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and water pressure of [[groundwater]], or rainfall, or transport of water by rivers and canals. This usually means that the polder has an excess of water, which is pumped out or drained by opening [[sluice]]s at [[low tide]]. Care must be taken not to set the internal water level too low. Polder land made up of [[peat]] (former marshland) will sink in relation to its previous level, because of peat decomposing when exposed to oxygen from the air. 
 
Polders are at risk from flooding at all times, and care must be taken to protect the surrounding dikes. Dikes are typically built with locally available materials, and each material has its own risks: sand is prone to collapse owing to saturation by water; dry peat is lighter than water and potentially unable to retain water in very dry seasons. Some animals dig tunnels in the barrier, allowing water to infiltrate the structure; the [[muskrat]] is known for this activity and hunted in certain European countries because of it. Polders are most commonly, though not exclusively, found in river deltas, former [[fen]]lands, and coastal areas.

Flooding of polders has also been used as a military tactic in the past. One example is the flooding of the polders along the [[Yser]] River during [[World War I]]. Opening the sluices at high tide and closing them at low tide turned the polders into an inaccessible swamp, which allowed the Allied armies to stop the German army.

==Etymology==
The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''polder'' derives successively from [[Middle Dutch]] ''polre'', from [[Old Dutch]] ''polra'', and ultimately from ''pol-'', a piece of land elevated above its surroundings, with the [[augmentative]] suffix ''-er'' and [[Epenthesis|epenthetical]] '' -d-''. The word has been adopted in thirty-six languages.&lt;ref&gt;Sijs, N. van der, 2010. Nederlandse woorden wereldwijd, 747 pp. Sdu Uitgevers bv, Den Haag. {{ISBN|9789012582148}}, https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/files/458170/Nww_compleet_archief.pdf, page 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polders and the Netherlands==
[[File:Gemaal de Leyens.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Pumping station in [[Zoetermeer]], the [[Netherlands]]: The polder lies lower than the surrounding water on the other side of the dike. The [[Archimedes' screw|Archimedes' screws]] are clearly visible.]]

The [[Netherlands]] is frequently associated with polders, as its engineers became noted for developing techniques to drain wetlands and make them usable for agriculture and other development. This is illustrated by the saying &quot;God created the world, but the Dutch created the Netherlands&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Forrest Clingerman, Brian Treanor, Martin Drenthen, David Utsler, ''Interpreting Nature: The Emerging Field of Environmental Hermeneutics'', Fordham University Press, 1 sep. 2013. The sentence stems from a poem by Archibald Pitcairn (1652–1713): ''Tellurem fecere dei, sua littora Belgae''. C.D. van Strien, ''British Travellers in Holland During the Stuart Period: Edward Browne and John Locke as Tourists in the United Provinces'', Leiden 1993, 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] have a long history of reclamation of marshes and fenland, resulting in some 3,000 ''polders''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/rws/waterinnovatiebron/cgi-bin/toonlijst.pl?config=config&amp;var=volgnr&amp;val=1&amp;layout=index-forceframe&amp;confignr=1&amp;menu=1067260347&amp;menuitem=1120115781| publisher=Rijkswaterstaat| title=''Kijk naar de geschiedenis''| accessdate=2008-01-21}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; nationwide. By 1961, about half of the country's land, {{convert|6800|sqmi|order=flip||}}, was reclaimed from the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;ley196110&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half the total surface area of ''polders'' in north-west Europe is in the Netherlands. The first [[embankment dam|embankments]] in Europe were constructed in Roman times. The first polders were constructed in the 11th century. The oldest extant polder is the [[Achtermeer]] polder, from 1533.

As a result of flooding disasters, [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water board]]s called ''waterschap'' (when situated more inland) or ''hoogheemraadschap'' (near the sea, mainly used in the [[Holland]] region)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=waterschap|url = http://www.waterschappen.nl/mijn-waterschap.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102142234/http://www.waterschappen.nl/|archivedate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Reh, W., Steenbergen, C., Aten, D. 2007. Sea of Land, The polder as an experimental atlas of Dutch landscape architecture. 344 pp, Uitgeverij Architectura &amp; Natura. {{ISBN|9789071123962}} &lt;/ref&gt; were set up to maintain the integrity of the water defences around polders, maintain the waterways inside a polder, and control the various water levels inside and outside the polder. Water boards hold separate elections, levy taxes, and function independently from other government bodies. Their function is basically unchanged even today. As such, they are the oldest democratic institutions in the country. The necessary cooperation among all ranks to maintain polder integrity gave its name to the Dutch version of [[Third Way (centrism)|third-way politics]]—the ''[[Polder Model]]''.

The [[North Sea flood of 1953|1953 flood disaster]] prompted a new approach to the design of dikes and other water-retaining structures, based on an acceptable probability of overflowing. Risk is defined as the product of probability and consequences. The potential damage in lives, property, and rebuilding costs is compared with the potential cost of water defences. From these calculations follows an acceptable flood risk from the sea at one in 4,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;years, while it is one in 100–2,500&amp;nbsp;years for a river flood. The particular established policy guides the Dutch government to improve flood defences as new data on threat levels become available.

Major Dutch polders and the years they were laid dry include [[Beemster]] (1609–1612), [[Schermer]] (1633–1635), and [[Haarlemmermeerpolder]] (1852). Polders created as part of the [[Zuiderzee Works]] include [[Wieringermeerpolder]] (1930), [[Noordoostpolder]] (1942) and [[Flevopolder]] (1956–1968)

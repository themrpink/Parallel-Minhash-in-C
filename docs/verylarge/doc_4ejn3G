Wedge appears in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' as a member of the newly formed [[Rogue Squadron]]. He flies a snowspeeder under the callsign &quot;Rogue Three&quot; against the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]'s [[AT-AT]] ground assault with [[Wes Janson]] as his harpoon gunner. Their snowspeeder inflicts the first casualty against the AT-AT attack group by firing a harpoon trailing a tow cable into one of the walker's legs and circling the walker several times, causing it to trip and fall and allowing Rebel forces to destroy the walker. After the battle, Wedge is seen and heard wishing Luke a safe trip.&lt;ref name=&quot;SWV&quot;&gt;''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'' (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004), disc 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wedge appears towards the end of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' as the leader of Red Squadron in the [[Battle of Endor]]. Along with [[Lando Calrissian]], who pilots the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' with [[Nien Nunb]], he leads the fighter attack on the second Death Star. His dogfighting prowess is shown again in this battle, as Wedge personally shoots down a number of Imperial [[TIE fighter]]s, and appears to easily navigate the narrow and treacherous flight spaces inside the Death Star that lead to its core. When he and Lando reach the Death Star's core, Wedge destroys the power regulator on the core's north tower, while Lando destroys the core itself. He later appears at the victory celebration at the Ewok village on Endor.&lt;ref name=&quot;SWVI&quot;&gt;''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'' (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004), disc 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wedge appears, once again played by Denis Lawson, in the final installment of the ''Star Wars'' sequel trilogy, ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=RFRRebelForce|url=https://twitter.com/RFRRebelForce/status/1180567302875557889?s=09|title=LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT THING.

===''Legends''===
In April 2014, most of the licensed ''Star Wars'' novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' were rebranded by Lucasfilm as ''Star Wars Legends'' and declared non-canon to the franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;THR Legends&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SW Legends&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page |publisher=[[StarWars.com]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SW Adult&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line |title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of ''Star Wars'' Adult Fiction line |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wedge appears in the 1983 [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|Marvel ''Star Wars'' comic]] &quot;Hoth Stuff!&quot;, in which it is revealed that he went missing during the Battle of [[Hoth]]. Aboard his ship, Luke and [[Leia]] listen to his log tape recounting how he survived the Imperial invasion by hiding with Janson in the AT-AT Luke took down. They were prevented from contacting the Rebellion from orbiting TIE fighters and had to face [[wampa]]s and other dangers. Janson was eventually killed by scavengers; Wedge then stole one of their ships to escape the planet and contact the Rebellion. He suddenly appears outside one of the windows, after working on the ship from space. Leia also states that Wedge and Luke grew up together on [[Tatooine]], which Wedge seems to confirm in his log by mentioning a girlfriend he had there.

''Star Wars Legends'' literature explains that Wedge's parents were killed when their [[starship]]-refueling depot exploded.&lt;ref name=&quot;databank&quot; /&gt; He piloted a freighter before joining the [[Rebel Alliance]] as a [[Military spacecraft in fiction|starfighter]] pilot.&lt;ref name=&quot;databank&quot; /&gt;

Wedge is the lead character in most of the ''[[Star Wars: X-wing (book series)|Star Wars: X-Wing]]'' novels by [[Michael A. Stackpole]] and [[Aaron Allston]], set in the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]]. Several [[Dark Horse Comics]] series focus on Wedge and Rogue Squadron, and the character also appears in other expanded universe works including the ''[[New Jedi Order]]'' and ''[[Legacy of the Force]]'' novels. Wedge is one of two main [[player character]]s in the ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (series)|Rogue Squadron]]'' video game series (Luke Skywalker is the other), and Wedge appears as a minor character in ''[[Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy]]'', helping the player during one mission. He is also a playable character in ''[[Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;databank&quot; /&gt;

'''Princess Leia Organa'''{{efn|Also Senator or General Leia Organa}}{{efn|name=name}} is a fictional character in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, portrayed in films by [[Carrie Fisher]]. Introduced in the [[Star Wars (film)|original ''Star Wars'' film]]{{EpIV}} in 1977, Leia is princess of the planet [[Alderaan]], a member of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial Senate]] and an agent of the [[Rebel Alliance]]. She thwarts the sinister [[Sith]] lord [[Darth Vader]] and helps bring about the destruction of the Empire's cataclysmic superweapon, the [[Death Star]]. In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), Leia commands a Rebel base and evades Vader as she falls in love with the smuggler [[Han Solo]]. In ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), Leia helps in the operation to rescue Han from the [[crime lord]] [[Jabba the Hutt]], and is revealed to be Vader's daughter and the twin sister of [[Luke Skywalker]].

The [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel]] film ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) establishes that the twins' mother is Senator (and former queen) [[Padmé Amidala]] of [[Naboo]], who dies after childbirth. Leia is adopted by Senator [[Bail Organa|Bail]] and Queen [[Breha Organa]] of Alderaan. In the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]], Leia is the founder and General of the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] against the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]]. She and Han have a son named Ben Solo, who adopted the name [[Kylo Ren]] after turning to the dark side of [[the Force]] and became the lead enforcer for the First Order. In ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'' (2019), it is revealed that Leia was briefly trained as a Jedi by her brother sometime after ''Return of the Jedi''. In the film, Leia is the mentor of [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], the last remaining Jedi. Leia dies towards the end of the film, but returns in the epilogue scene as a Force ghost alongside Luke.

One of the more popular ''Star Wars'' characters, Leia has been called a 1980s [[cultural icon|icon]], a [[Feminism|feminist]] hero and model for other adventure heroines. She has appeared in many derivative works and merchandising, including the now-noncanonical [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]], and has been referenced or [[parodied]] in several TV shows and films. Her '[[cinnamon bun]]' hairstyle from ''Star Wars'' (1977) and [[Princess Leia's bikini|metal bikini]] from ''Return of the Jedi'' have become cultural icons. Fisher was nominated for the [[Saturn Award for Best Actress]] twice for ''A New Hope'' and ''Return of the Jedi''. Fisher later received two [[Saturn Awards|Saturn Award]] nominations for [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], the first for ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' and the second being a posthumous nomination for ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]''.

==Creation and casting==
Leia was created by ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]], who in 1999 explained his early development of the main characters:
{{Quote|The first [version] talked about a princess and an old general. The second version involved a father, his son, and his daughter; the daughter was the heroine of the film. Now the daughter has become Luke, [[Mark Hamill]]'s character. There was also the story of two brothers where I transformed one of them into a sister.

She said in 2014:
{{Quote|I would rather have played Han Solo. When I first read the script I thought that's the part to be, always wry and sardonic. He's always that. I feel like a lot of the time Leia's either worried or pissed or, thank God, sort of snarky. But I'm much more worried and pissed than Han Solo ever was, and those aren't fun things to play ... I had a lot of fun killing [[Jabba the Hutt]]. They asked me on the day if I wanted to have a stunt double kill Jabba. No! That's the best time I ever had as an actor.

=====''A New Hope''=====
[[File:Star Wars and the Power of Costume July 2018 13 (Princess Leia's white gown from Episode IV).jpg|thumb|Princess Leia's white gown from the original ''Star Wars'' film]]
Introduced in the original 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'',{{EpIV}} Princess Leia Organa of [[Alderaan]] is a member of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial Senate]]. She is captured by [[Darth Vader]] (portrayed by [[David Prowse]], voiced by [[James Earl Jones]]) on board the ship ''[[Tantive IV]]'', where she is acting as a spy for the [[Rebel Alliance]]. Leia has secretly hidden the blueprints for the [[Death Star]], the Empire's moon-sized battle station, inside the [[droid (Star Wars)|astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]] ([[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]]) and has sent it to find one of the last remaining [[Jedi]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[Alec Guinness]]), on the nearby planet of [[Tatooine]]. Vader arrests Leia and has her tortured, but she resists revealing anything. Death Star commander [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] ([[Peter Cushing]]) threatens to destroy her home planet Alderaan with the Death Star unless she reveals the location of the hidden Rebel base. She provides the location of an old, abandoned base on the planet Dantooine, but Tarkin orders Alderaan to be destroyed anyway. Leia is rescued by [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) and [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), and they escape aboard Han's ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. After analyzing the Death Star's schematics, the Rebels find a tiny weakness in the battle station, which Luke uses to destroy it in his [[X-wing fighter]]. In the aftermath of the victory, Leia bestows medals on the heroes at the hidden Rebel base on [[Yavin 4]].

Alyssa Rosenberg of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' writes of Leia in the film:
{{Quote|Leia's nerves as a revolutionary are clear from the moment she arrives on screen ... She takes shots at the Storm Troopers boarding her ship, gets stunned with a blaster in her hand, then has the audacity to try to make Darth Vader feel ashamed of himself ... She has enough energy left over after a nasty session of torture to insult Grand Moff Tarkin. And while she grieves when her home planet, Alderaan, is destroyed by the Death Star, Leia's not paralyzed: when her unexpected rescuers show up, she’s ready to go, and to gripe about their operational sloppiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP Icon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/05/04/princess-leia-political-icon/ |title=Princess Leia, political icon |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Alyssa |last=Rosenberg |date=May 4, 2015 |access-date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rosenberg also notes that, though Han is almost immediately attracted to Leia, they conflict because she insists on asserting command and he automatically resists, even as she proves herself to be worthy of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP Icon&quot;/&gt; And despite her initial disdain for the smuggler, whom she sees as selfish, Leia later acknowledges &quot;I knew there was more to you than money&quot; when Han comes through for the Rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP Icon&quot;/&gt;

Fisher told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1980 that in the original script, when Luke and Han come to rescue a captured Leia, &quot;I was hanging upside down with yellow eyes, like in ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' ... Some form of radar torture was done to me and I was in a beam, bruised and beaten up, suspended in midair. The reason it was cut from the film was because I was unconscious and the [[Wookiee]] would have had to carry me for, like, the next fifteen minutes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS 1980&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/slaves-to-the-empire-the-star-wars-kids-talk-back-19800724 |title=Slaves to the Empire: The ''Star Wars'' Kids Talk Back |work=Rolling Stone |first=Timothy |last=White |date=July 24, 1980 |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''The Empire Strikes Back''=====
In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), Leia is at the Rebel base on [[Hoth]]. She leads its evacuation during an Imperial attack, and then flees with Han, [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]) and [[C-3PO]] ([[Anthony Daniels]]) on the ''Millennium Falcon''. They dodge pursuing Imperial [[TIE fighters]] by flying into an asteroid field when the ''Falcon''{{'s}} hyperdrive breaks down, with Leia piloting the ship at one point. Romance blossoms between Leia and Han during their flight from the Empire; while hiding in the stomach of a space slug, they finally share a kiss. With his ship needing repairs, Han seeks out his old friend [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]) in [[Bespin|Cloud City]], the [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] over [[Bespin]]. Though he welcomes them graciously, Lando soon turns them over to a newly arrived Darth Vader, who hopes to use them as bait to capture Luke. Leia confesses her love for Han as he is frozen in [[carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] and then handed over to bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]] ([[Jeremy Bulloch]]), who is charged with bringing him to the crime lord [[Jabba the Hutt]]. Lando helps Leia, Chewbacca and the two droids escape. Leia senses that Luke is in trouble, and goes back to save him after he is nearly killed during a [[lightsaber]] duel and confrontation with Vader.

Rosenberg notes:
{{Quote|Yes, it's slightly ridiculous ... that [Han] tries to pry a confession of affection out of her on Hoth, as Leia is trying to manage an evacuation with just an ion cannon for defense. But Han's not wrong that if Leia doesn't figure out that she's a person with needs, she's going to burn out ... In a way, it's an early confession of love: Han’s anxious about the bounty hunters who are still pursuing him ... But he would stay and give his love and support to Leia if she could just acknowledge that she needs him.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP Icon&quot;/&gt;}}

=====''Return of the Jedi''=====

In ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), Leia infiltrates Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine disguised as the [[Ubese]] bounty hunter Boushh, and brings a captive Chewbacca with her as part of the ruse. She frees Han from the carbonite, but they are recaptured by Jabba. Leia is now chained to Jabba as his slave, outfitted in a [[Princess Leia's bikini|metal bikini]]. After Luke arrives and kills Jabba's [[Rancor]], Jabba sentences Luke, Han and Chewbacca to be fed to the [[Sarlacc]]. Lando (disguised as a guard) helps them overpower their captors, and Leia seizes the moment to strangle Jabba with her chain. Luke and Leia swing to safety, blowing up Jabba's barge behind them. Later, the heroes go to the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] to prepare for a battle with the Empire. There, Luke reveals to Leia that she is his twin sister and that Vader is their father. Leia joins Han in leading the Rebels in battle with Imperial troops as the Rebel Fleet attacks the second Death Star. Leia is slightly injured, but the Rebels, with help from the [[Ewoks]], ultimately defeat the forces of the Empire, with the Death Star destroyed once more.

Fisher told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 1983, &quot;In ''Return of the Jedi'', [Leia] gets to be more feminine, more supportive, more affectionate. But let's not forget that these movies are basically boys' fantasies. So the other way they made her more female in this one was to have her take off her clothes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone 1983&quot;/&gt; Rosenberg writes of Han and Leia:
{{Quote|And we know those two crazy kids are locked for life in ''Return of the Jedi'' when it turns out that Han has accepted a Generalship in the Rebellion, keeping it a secret from Leia. In ''A New Hope'', Leia was grumbling about the quality of Han as a rescuer ... But when she finds out what Han's done, accepting a rank he once found insulting and a mission she knows to be dangerous, Leia is the first person to volunteer to join his strike team. In ''Star Wars'', that's what love looks like: trusting your partner’s commitment to the cause and respecting his strategic and technical judgement.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP Icon&quot;/&gt;}}

In the film, Leia says that she has vague memories of her real mother, who she describes as &quot;kind... but sad&quot;. Bouzereau quoted Lucas in 1997:
{{Quote|The part that I never really developed is the death of Luke and Leia's mother. I had a [[backstory]] for her in earlier drafts, but it basically didn't survive. When I got to ''Jedi'', I wanted one of the kids to have some kind of memory of her because she will be a key figure in the new episodes I'm writing. But I really debated whether or not Leia should remember her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Laurent|last=Bouzereau |author-link=Laurent Bouzereau|title=The Annotated Screenplays |date=1997 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Prequel trilogy====
{{main|Star Wars prequel trilogy}}

=====''Revenge of the Sith''=====
In the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel film]] ''Revenge of the Sith'' (2005), Padmé Amidala ([[Natalie Portman]]) is pregnant with [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s ([[Hayden Christensen]]) twins near the end of the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. After Anakin turns to the dark side of [[the Force]] and becomes Darth Vader, Padmé gives birth to Luke and Leia on Polis Massa and then dies.{{efn|name=name|According to an official character encyclopedia, Leia's full birth name is Leia Amidala Skywalker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hidalgo |first=Pablo |title=Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded |year=2017 |origyear=2016 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9781465454966 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=taVyDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Leia is adopted by Senator [[Bail Organa]] ([[Jimmy Smits]]) and his wife Queen Breha ([[Rebecca Jackson Mendoza]]) of Alderaan.

Film critic [[Peter Travers]] of ''Rolling Stone'' wrote, &quot;As we watch Anakin nearly melt in the lava, only to be put together, [[Frankenstein]] style, in a lab while Lucas intercuts scenes of Padme giving birth to the twins Luke and Leia, a link to genuine feeling is established at last.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith-20050519 |first=Peter |last=Travers |author-link=Peter Travers |title=Review: ''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=May 13, 2005 |access-date=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, Leia is the leader of the Resistance, a group formed by the New Republic to fight a proxy war with the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] (a group formed by the remnants of the Empire) and trying to find Luke, who disappeared years earlier. When her forces foil a First Order attack searching for the Resistance [[droid (Star Wars)|astromech droid]] [[BB-8]], Leia is reunited with Han, who has helped the renegade [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]] ([[John Boyega]]) and orphaned scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]) bring the droid this far. Han and Leia have been estranged for many years; their marriage fell apart after their son, Ben Solo ([[Adam Driver]]), fell to the dark side and became the First Order commander [[Kylo Ren]]. Leia believes Ben can still be brought back to the light side. Han volunteers for a mission to infiltrate the First Order's [[Starkiller Base]] to disable its defensive shields. Confronting Ren, Han tries to convince his son to leave the First Order, but Ren instead impales his father on his [[lightsaber]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Han Death&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2015/12/21/jj-abrams-kylo-ren-shocking-act-star-wars-force-awakens |title=We Need to Talk About Kylo |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Anthony |last=Breznican |date=December 21, 2015 |access-date=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leia senses Han's death through [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]], and later shares a moment of grief with Rey, who had thought of Han as a mentor and father figure. Leia sees Rey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 off when they depart to locate Luke, saying, &quot;may the Force be with you&quot;.

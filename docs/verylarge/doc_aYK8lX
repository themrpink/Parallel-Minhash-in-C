ii) uniformly on ''E'' if and only if ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges uniformly as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

iii) absolutely on ''E'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty |f_n|&lt;/math&gt; converges for every &lt;math&gt;x\in E&lt;/math&gt;.

With this definition comes the following result: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Let x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''be contained in the set E and each  f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be continuous at x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. If  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f=\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n &lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on E then f  is continuous at x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''in E. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;E=[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and each f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is integrable on E. If  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n &lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on E then f is integrable on E and the series of integrals of  f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to integral of the series of f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Almost uniform convergence==
If the domain of the functions is a [[measure space]] ''E'' then the related notion of '''almost uniform convergence''' can be defined. We say a sequence of functions &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; converges almost uniformly on ''E'' if for every &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a measurable set &lt;math&gt;E_\delta&lt;/math&gt; with measure less than &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that  the sequence of functions &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on &lt;math&gt;E \setminus E_\delta&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, almost uniform convergence means there are sets of arbitrarily small measure for which the sequence of functions converges uniformly on their complement.

Note that almost uniform convergence of a sequence does not mean that the sequence converges uniformly [[almost everywhere]] as might be inferred from the name. However, [[Egorov's theorem]] does guarantee that on a finite measure space, a sequence of functions that converges [[Pointwise convergence#Almost everywhere convergence|almost everywhere]] also converges almost uniformly on the same set.

Almost uniform convergence implies [[almost everywhere convergence]] and [[convergence in measure]].

'''Norman Bates''' is a fictional character created by American author [[Robert Bloch]] as the main [[antagonist]] in his 1959 thriller novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''. He was portrayed by [[Anthony Perkins]] in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the 1960 version of ''Psycho'']] directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and the [[Psycho (franchise)|''Psycho'' franchise]]. He was also portrayed by [[Vince Vaughn]] in [[Psycho (1998 film)|the 1998 version of ''Psycho'']], and by [[Freddie Highmore]] in the television series ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'' (2013–2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Gilbert|last=Cruz|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/03/thoughts-on-norman-bates-and-psychos-4-sequels.html|title=We All Go a Little Mad Sometimes: On Norman Bates and Psycho’s Four Sequels|date=March 25, 2013|work=[[Vulture.com]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the franchise produced by [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]], Norman is not the principal antagonist in Bloch's subsequent novels and is succeeded by [[copycat killer]]s who assume Norman's identity after his death in ''[[Psycho II (novel)|Psycho II]]'' (1982). There is a wide-ranging assumption that the character was inspired by the [[Wisconsin]] murderer [[Ed Gein]]. Bloch later revealed that he had already started writing ''Psycho'' when he first became aware of Gein, and was struck by &quot;how closely the imaginary character I'd created resembled the real Ed Gein both in overt act and apparent motivation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paula|last=Guran|url=http://darkecho.com/darkecho/horroronline/bloch.html|title=BEHIND THE BATES MOTEL: Robert Bloch|work=Dark Echo Horror Online|date=August 1999|accessdate=April 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814074208/http://darkecho.com/darkecho/horroronline/bloch.html|archive-date=August 14, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character overview==
Both the 1959 novel, and its [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film adaptation]] explain that Norman suffered severe [[emotional abuse]] as a child at the hands of his mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma]], who preached to him that [[sexual intercourse]] was sinful and that all women (except herself) were whores. The novel also suggests that their relationship may have been [[incest]]uous.

After Norman's father died, Norman and his mother lived alone together &quot;as if there was no one else in the world&quot; until Norman reached adolescence, when his mother met Joe Considine (Chet Rudolph in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'') and planned to marry. Considine eventually convinced Norma to open a motel. Driven over the edge with jealousy, Norman [[murder]]ed both of them with [[strychnine]]. After committing the murders, Norman staged it like [[murder–suicide]], making it look as if Norma had killed her fiancé and then herself. After a brief hospitalization for shock, he developed a [[dissociative identity disorder|split personality]], assuming his mother's personality to repress his awareness of her death and to escape the guilt of murdering her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Peter|last=Breslow|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91947125|title=Norman Bates: A Most Terrifying Mama's Boy|work=[[NPR.org]]|date=July 1, 2008|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He inherited his mother's house—where he kept her corpse in the fruit cellar—and the family motel in the fictional small town of Fairvale, California. As &quot;Mother&quot;, he kills women that Norman feels attracted to, and anyone else who threatens the illusion of her existence. Norman passes out when &quot;Mother&quot; takes control; after &quot;Mother&quot; commits a murder, Norman awakens and destroys the evidence, convinced that &quot;she&quot; alone is responsible for the crime.

Bloch sums up Norman's multiple personalities in his stylistic form of [[pun]]s: &quot;Norman&quot;, a child needing his mother; &quot;Norma&quot;, a possessive, controlling parent figure; and &quot;Normal&quot;, a functional adult who goes through the motions of day-to-day life. &quot;Norma&quot; dominates and belittles &quot;Norman&quot; much as she had when she was alive, forbidding him to have a life outside of her and flying into violent rages whenever he feels attracted to a woman. &quot;Norma&quot; and &quot;Norman&quot; carry on conversations through Norman talking to himself and to her corpse in his mother's voice, and Norman dresses in his mother's clothes whenever &quot;Norma&quot; takes hold completely.&lt;ref name=&quot;psychobook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first = Robert|last = Bloch|authorlink=Robert Bloch|title = Psycho|publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|location = New York City|year = 1959|isbn = 978-1590203354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Psycho'' (novel and film)==
In Bloch's 1959 novel and the 1960 Hitchcock film, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Janet Leigh]]), a young woman on the run after stealing money from her employer, checks into the motel one night. Norman is smitten with her, and shyly asks her to have dinner with him in the house. &quot;Mother&quot; flies into a rage and threatens to kill Marion if Norman lets her in the house. Norman defies her and eats dinner with Marion anyway, but lashes out at her when she suggests that he institutionalize his mother. When Marion goes to her room to shower, Norman spies on her through a peephole he drilled in the wall. &quot;Mother&quot; takes control and stabs Marion to death (she beheads her in the novel). When Norman awakes to discover what he believes his mother has done, he sinks Marion's car—with her corpse and the money in the trunk—into a nearby swamp. As &quot;Mother&quot;, he also murders Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), a private detective hired by Marion's employer, days later.

Norman is finally caught when Marion's sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and boyfriend, Sam Loomis ([[John Gavin]]), arrive at the motel looking for her. When Norman figures out what they want, he knocks Sam out and goes running after Lila, who has reached the house and found Mrs. Bates' corpse. He attacks her as &quot;Mother&quot;, but Sam, after awakening from having been knocked out, overpowers him, and Norman is finally arrested. Norman is declared [[insanity|insane]] and sent to an institution, where &quot;Mother&quot; takes complete, and permanent, control of his mind: he ''becomes'' his mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;psychobook&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[Alfred Hitchcock]] (Director)|date=September 8, 1960|title=[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]|medium=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novel sequels==
===''Psycho II''===
In Bloch's 1982 sequel to his first novel, ''[[Psycho II (novel)|Psycho II]]'', Norman escapes from the psychiatric hospital by killing a nun and donning her habit. Picked up as a hitchhiker, Norman tries to attack the driver with a tire iron, but the driver overpowers him. This in turn causes a fiery accident where the driver escapes, but Norman dies. Meanwhile, Dr. Adam Claiborne, who discovered Norman's corpse, assumes his personality and goes on a killing spree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Robert|last = Bloch|authorlink=Robert Bloch|title = Psycho II|publisher = [[Whisper Press]]|location=Venice, California|year = 1982|isbn = 978-0-918372-08-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Psycho House''===
In Bloch's 1990 sequel to his second novel, ''[[Psycho House]]'', Norman appears only as a novelty [[animatronic]] on display in the Bates Motel, which has been converted into a tourist attraction.

===''Psycho: Sanitarium''===
In Chet Williamson's 2016 prequel to the second novel, ''[[Psycho: Sanitarium]]'',  Dr. Felix Reed tries to bring Norman out of a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state. ''Sanitarium'' introduces Robert Newman, Norman's twin brother who was taken away at birth after the attending doctor pronounced him brain damaged. As Robert and Norman grow to know each other, Norman senses a darkness in Robert, even deeper than that which has lurked in Norman himself.

==Film sequels==
===''Psycho II''===
In 1983's ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', the first sequel to the original film, Norman is released from the institution twenty-two years after his arrest, seemingly cured. He meets Mary Samuels ([[Meg Tilly]])—later revealed to be Mary Loomis, Lila and Sam Loomis's daughter and Marion Crane's niece—and falls in love with her. However, a series of mysterious murders occurs, as well as strange appearances and messages from his mother, and Norman slowly loses his grip on [[sanity]]. The mysterious appearances and messages turn out to be a plot by Lila to drive him insane again in order to get him recommitted. The actual murders turn out to be the work of Norman's coworker, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). Before Norman discovers this, however, Mary Loomis is shot dead by the police during a confrontation with Norman, and Mrs. Spool murders Lila. When Spool tells Norman that she is his real mother, he kills her and [[embalming|embalms]] her corpse while assuming the &quot;Mother&quot; personality once again.&lt;ref name = &quot;PsychoTwo&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people = Richard Franklin (Director)|title = [[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]|medium = DVD|location = United States|publisher = [[Universal Pictures]]|date=June 3, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Psycho III''===
In 1986's ''[[Psycho III]]'', set a month later, Norman continues to struggle, unsuccessfully, against &quot;Mother&quot;'s dominion. He also finds another love interest named Maureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), who eventually dies at &quot;Mother&quot;'s hand. In the film, Mrs. Spool's corpse is first discovered by sleazy musician Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), whom Norman kills when Duke tries to use the discovery to [[blackmail]] Norman. Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a reporter interested in Norman's case, finds out that Spool was in fact Norman's aunt — Norma Bates' sister — who was in love with Norman's father and killed him when he chose Norma over her. She then kidnapped the child Norman, believing him to be her own, but she was arrested and institutionalized, leaving Norman to be raised by Norma.

&quot;Mother&quot; orders Norman to kill Tracy, but in the end he destroys Spool's corpse, attempting to break free of her control. He is then arrested and put back in the institution.&lt;ref name = &quot;PsychoThree&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people = [[Anthony Perkins]] (Director)|title = [[Psycho III]]|medium = DVD|location = United States|publisher = [[Universal Pictures]]|date= July 2, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Psycho IV: The Beginning''===
''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990), the final film in the series, [[retroactive continuity|retcons]] the revelations of the second and third film, supplying that Norman's father was stung to death by bees and removing all references to Emma Spool. In this film, Norman has been released from an institution, and is married to one of the hospital's psychologists, a woman named Connie ([[Donna Mitchell]]). When his wife becomes [[pregnancy|pregnant]], he lures her to his mother's house and tries to kill her, wanting to prevent another of his &quot;cursed&quot; line from being born into the world; the film implies that Mrs. Bates ([[Olivia Hussey]]) suffered from [[schizophrenia]] and [[borderline personality disorder]] and passed the illnesses on to her son. However, he relents at the last minute, when Connie professes her love for him. He then burns the house down in an attempt to free himself of his past. During the attempt, he is tormented by [[hallucination]]s of &quot;Mother&quot; and several of his victims. He almost dies in the flames before willing himself to get out, apparently defeating his illness at long last; he is finally free of his mother's voice, which demands to be let out. This was Anthony Perkins' final performance as Norman Bates; [[Henry Thomas]] portrayed Norman as a teenager.&lt;ref name = &quot;PsychoFour&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people = [[Mick Garris]] (Director)|title = [[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]|medium = DVD|location = United States|publisher = [[Universal Television]]|date= November 10, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
===''Bates Motel'' (film)===
In the 1987 television spin-off movie and series pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'', Norman is never released from the institution after his first incarceration. He befriends Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]), a fellow inmate who had murdered his stepfather, and [[will (law)|wills]] ownership of the titular motel to him before dying of old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Richard Rothstein (Director)|date=July 5, 1987|title=[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Universal Television]]|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bates Motel'' (TV series)===
The TV series ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', a prequel to the 1960 film ''Psycho'', set in the present day, depicts the young Norman Bates' life with his mother, Norma ([[Vera Farmiga]]). In this continuity, Norman suffers from hallucinations and blackouts, and begins manifesting his &quot;Mother&quot; personality while Norma is alive. He kills his abusive father, Sam ([[David Cubitt]]), while in a [[dissociative state]], and Norma moves them from Arizona, where he was born and raised, to White Pine Bay, Oregon, to protect him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Truth|episodelink=Bates Motel (season 1)#ep6|series=Bates Motel (TV series)|serieslink=Bates Motel (TV series)|network=A&amp;E|airdate=April 22, 2013|season=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also introduces his maternal half-brother, Dylan Massett ([[Max Thieriot]]) and gives him a love interest in Emma Decody ([[Olivia Cooke]]), a classmate with [[cystic fibrosis]].

When Norman's sanity begins to deteriorate, Norma marries the town sheriff, Alex Romero ([[Nestor Carbonell]]), so she can use his insurance coverage to pay for Norman to be treated in a mental institution. While the marriage is at first merely a financial arrangement, they eventually fall in love. After Norman is released from the institution and finds out that Norma is married, he grows insanely jealous and tries to kill both Norma and himself by flooding the house with [[carbon monoxide]] while his mother sleeps. Romero arrives at the house in time to revive Norman, but finds that Norma is already dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Forever|episodelink=Bates Motel (season 4)#ep9|series=Bates Motel (TV series)|serieslink=Bates Motel (TV series)|network=A&amp;E|airdate=May 9, 2016|season=4|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romero figures out what happened and swears revenge, but is arrested for perjury before he can do anything.

Two years later, Norman is running the motel and living alone in the house with Norma's corpse, which he keeps frozen and preserved in the cellar. He and his &quot;Mother&quot; personality live together as if there is no one else in the world, and she takes care of his problems - such as killing and disposing of a hitman sent by Romero&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Dark Paradise|episodelink=Bates Motel (season 5)#ep1|series=Bates Motel (TV series)|serieslink=Bates Motel (TV series)|network=A&amp;E|airdate=February 20, 2017|season=5|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helping him get rid of his uncle, Norma's brother Caleb ([[Kenny Johnson]]), after he discovers the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Bad Blood|episodelink=Bates Motel (season 5)#ep3|series=Bates Motel (TV series)|serieslink=Bates Motel (TV series)|network=A&amp;E|airdate=March 6, 2017|season=5|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman falls for Madeline Loomis (Isabelle McNally), a lonely woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Norma, and whose husband Sam ([[Austin Nichols]]) is cheating on her. &quot;Mother&quot; becomes jealous and starts behaving erratically, at one point taking possession of Norman's mind and making him have sex with a man at a [[gay bar]] while dressed in Norma's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Dreams Die First|episodelink=Bates Motel (season 5)#ep5|series=Bates Motel (TV series)|serieslink=Bates Motel (TV series)|network=A&amp;E|airdate=March 20, 2017|season=5|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman finally begins to suspect that &quot;Mother&quot; is not real, and she confirms that he created her in his mind to deal with things that he could not, such as his abusive father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marion&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Marion|episodelink=Bates Motel (season 5)#ep6|series=Bates Motel (TV series)|serieslink=Bates Motel (TV series)|network=A&amp;E|airdate=March 27, 2017|season=5|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sam's mistress [[Marion Crane]] ([[Rihanna]]) checks into the motel, Norman has dinner with her and tells her that Sam is married. Marion comes back to the motel after confirming Sam's infidelity, and seeks comfort from Norman. He fears that &quot;Mother&quot; will kill her, however, and tells her to leave and never come back. When Sam comes to the motel to look for Marion, Norman stabs him to death in the shower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marion&quot;/&gt;

Dylan comes to see Norman after learning of Norma's death, and they get into a fight that ends with Norman assaulting his half-brother at &quot;Mother&quot;'s instigation.

There, Norman gets the better of Romero and shoots him dead, but not before his former stepfather tells him he will never escape from murdering his own mother.

Now completely alone, Norman loses all contact with reality. He calls Dylan and invites him over for a &quot;family dinner&quot;, complete with Norma's corpse seated at the head of the table. When Dylan tells him that Norma is dead, Norman flies into a rage and attacks him with a knife, forcing Dylan to shoot him in self-defense. As he dies, Norman sees a vision of his mother embracing him.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cord&quot;/&gt;

==Characterization==
The character Norman Bates in ''Psycho'' was loosely based on two people. First was the real-life murderer [[Ed Gein]], about whom Bloch later wrote a fictionalized account,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mental Floss&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Stacy|last=Conradt|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/49524/boys-best-friend-his-mother-everything-you-need-know-about-norman-bates|title=Everything You Need to Know About Norman Bates|work=[[Mental Floss]]|publisher=Dennis Media|location=New York City|date=March 18, 2013|access-date=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Shambles of Ed Gein&quot;, in 1962. (The story can be found in ''Crimes and Punishments: The Lost Bloch, Volume 3''). Second, it has been indicated by several people, including Noel Carter (wife of [[Lin Carter]]) and [[Chris Steinbrunner]], as well as allegedly by Bloch himself, that Norman Bates was partly based on Calvin Beck, publisher of ''[[Castle of Frankenstein]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mental Floss&quot;/&gt;

The characterization of Norman Bates in the novel and the movie differ in some key areas. In the novel, Norman is in his mid-to-late 40s, short, overweight and homely. In the movie, he is in his mid-20s, tall, slender, and handsome. Reportedly, when working on the film, Hitchcock decided that he wanted audiences to be able to sympathize with Norman and genuinely like the character, so he made him more of a &quot;boy next door&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Leigh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Janet|last=Leigh|authorlink=Janet Leigh|title=Psycho : Behind the Scenes of the Classic Thriller|publisher=Harmony Press|location=Easton, Pennsylvania|date=1995|isbn=978-0-517-70112-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/psychobehindscen00leig}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel, Norman becomes &quot;Mother&quot; after getting drunk and passing out; in the movie, he remains sober before switching personalities. &lt;!-- The following sentence is in dispute and lacks a reference: Finally, in the novel Mary Crane is &quot;Mother&quot;'s first victim, whereas in the film and its sequels, it is revealed that &quot;Mother&quot; had killed twice before.--&gt;

In the novel, Norman is well-read in [[occult]] and esoteric authors such as [[P.D. Ouspensky]] and [[Aleister Crowley]]. He is aware that &quot;Mother&quot; disapproves of these authors as being against religion.

==Portrayals==
Norman Bates was portrayed by [[Anthony Perkins]] in Hitchcock's seminal [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film adaptation]] of [[Psycho (novel)|Bloch's novel]] and its three sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=David|last=Ferrell|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-13/news/mn-1407_1_anthony-perkins|title=Anthony Perkins, 60, Dies; Star of 'Psycho' Had AIDS|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=September 13, 1992|access-date=August 9, 2017|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perkins hosted an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1976 in which he performed numerous sketches portraying Norman, including the instructional video &quot;The Norman Bates School of Motel Management&quot;. He also portrayed Norman, albeit more lightheartedly, in a 1990 commercial for [[Oatmeal Crisp]] cereal. [[Vince Vaughn]] portrayed Norman in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s [[Psycho (1998 film)|1998 version of ''Psycho'']], while [[Kurt Paul]], Perkins' &quot;Mother&quot; stunt double in ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' and ''[[Psycho III]]'', took on the role in the [[Bates Motel (film)|made-for-TV film spin-off]] ''Bates Motel''. Perkins' son [[Oz Perkins|Oz]] portrayed a younger version of Norman in ''Psycho II''. [[Henry Thomas]] played a younger version of the character in ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. [[Freddie Highmore]] portrayed Norman in the TV series ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''. For his performance, Highmore was nominated twice for a [[Critic's Choice Award]], a [[Saturn Award]], and won a [[43rd People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andy|last=Swift|url=http://tvline.com/2017/01/18/peoples-choice-awards-winners-2017-full-list/ |title=People's Choice Awards 2017 Winners: Priyanka Chopra, Outlander and More |website=tvline.com|date=January 21, 2017 |access-date=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic books==
Norman appears in the 1992 three-issue [[comic book]] adaptation of the 1960 film ''Psycho'' released by [[Innovation Publishing]]. Despite being a [[Film colorization|colorized]] adaptation of the Hitchcock film, the version of Norman present in the comics resembles the one from Bloch's original novel: a middle-aged, overweight, balding man. Comic artist Felipe Echevarria has explained that this was due to Perkins' refusal to allow his likeness to be replicated for the books, wanting to disassociate himself with Norman Bates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rich|last=Johnston|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/08/31/felipe-echevarria-on-taking-anthony-perkins-out-of-the-picture/|title=Felipe Echevarria, On Taking Anthony Perkins Out Of The Picture|work=[[Bleeding Cool]]|publisher=[[Avatar Press]]|location=Rantoul, Illinois|date=August 31, 2016|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

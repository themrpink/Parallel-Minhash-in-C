===Hormone replacement therapy===
{{Main|Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)}}
In the context of the menopause, [[hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT) is the use of [[estrogen]] in women without a uterus and estrogen plus [[progestin]] in women who have an intact uterus.&lt;ref&gt;The Woman's Health Program Monash University, [http://med.monash.edu.au/sphpm/womenshealth/docs/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy.pdf Oestrogen and Progestin as Hormone Therapy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711003526/http://med.monash.edu.au/sphpm/womenshealth/docs/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy.pdf |date=11 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HRT may be reasonable for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of The North American Menopause Society | journal = Menopause | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–55 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20154637 | doi = 10.1097/gme.0b013e3181d0f6b9 | last1 = &amp;Na | s2cid = 24806751 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1a31efdb2c43ce954a1cb4ced8e011351a094a23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most effective treatment option, especially when delivered as a skin patch.&lt;ref name=HRT2017&gt;{{cite journal | title = The 2012 hormone therapy position statement of: The North American Menopause Society | journal = Menopause | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–71 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22367731 | pmc = 3443956 | doi = 10.1097/GME.0000000000000921 | author1 = North American Menopause Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sarri G, Pedder H, Dias S, Guo Y, Lumsden MA | title = Vasomotor symptoms resulting from natural menopause: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of treatment effects from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline on menopause | journal = BJOG | volume = 124 | issue = 10 | pages = 1514–1523 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28276200 | doi = 10.1111/1471-0528.14619 | s2cid = 206909766 | url = http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/138525/7/138525.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use, however, appears to increase the risk of [[stroke]]s and [[blood clots]].&lt;ref name=boardman2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boardman HM, Hartley L, Eisinga A, Main C, Roqué i Figuls M, Bonfill Cosp X, Gabriel Sanchez R, Knight B | title = Hormone therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD002229 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25754617 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002229.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used for menopausal symptoms some recommend it be used for the shortest time possible and at the lowest dose possible.&lt;ref name=boardman2015 /&gt; Evidence to support long-term use, however, is poor.&lt;ref name=HRT2017/&gt;

It also appears effective for preventing bone loss and [[osteoporosis|osteoporotic]] fracture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Villiers TJ, Stevenson JC | title = The WHI: the effect of hormone replacement therapy on fracture prevention | journal = Climacteric | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 263–6 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22612613 | doi = 10.3109/13697137.2012.659975 | s2cid = 40340985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but it is generally recommended only for women at significant risk for whom other therapies are unsuitable.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marjoribanks J, Farquhar C, Roberts H, Lethaby A, Lee J | title = Long-term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | pages = CD004143 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28093732 | pmc = 6465148 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004143.pub5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HRT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; There is some concern that this treatment increases the risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChlebowskiAnderson2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chlebowski RT, Anderson GL | title = Menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer mortality: clinical implications | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safety | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 45–56 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25922653 | pmc = 4406918 | doi = 10.1177/2042098614568300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding [[testosterone]] to hormone therapy has a positive effect on sexual function in postmenopausal women, although it may be accompanied by hair growth, acne and a reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.&lt;ref name=&quot;Somboonporn_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Somboonporn W, Davis S, Seif MW, Bell R | title = Testosterone for peri- and postmenopausal women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD004509 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16235365 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004509.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These side effects diverge depending on the doses and methods of using testosterone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Somboonporn_2005&quot; /&gt;

===Selective estrogen receptor modulators===
[[Selective estrogen receptor modulator|SERM]]s are a category of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source, that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the [[estrogen receptor]]s throughout the body. The most commonly prescribed SERMs are [[raloxifene]] and [[tamoxifen]]. Raloxifene exhibits oestrogen agonist activity on bone and lipids, and antagonist activity on breast and the endometrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davis SR, Dinatale I, Rivera-Woll L, Davison S | title = Postmenopausal hormone therapy: from monkey glands to transdermal patches | journal = The Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 185 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–22 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15845914 | doi = 10.1677/joe.1.05847 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamoxifen is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Raloxifene prevents vertebral fractures in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women and reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bevers TB | title = The STAR trial: evidence for raloxifene as a breast cancer risk reduction agent for postmenopausal women | journal = Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | volume = 5 | issue = 8 | pages = 719–24 | date = September 2007 | doi = 10.6004/jnccn.2007.0073 | pmid = 17927929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other medications===
Some of the [[SSRIs]] and [[SNRIs]] appear to provide some relief from vasomotor symptoms.&lt;ref name=Kra2015/&gt; Low dose [[paroxetine]] is the only non-hormonal medication that was [[food and drug administration|FDA]]-approved to treat moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause as of 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;OrleansLi2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orleans RJ, Li L, Kim MJ, Guo J, Sobhan M, Soule L, Joffe HV | title = FDA approval of paroxetine for menopausal hot flushes | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 370 | issue = 19 | pages = 1777–9 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24806158 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1402080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill DA, Crider M, Hill SR | title = Hormone Therapy and Other Treatments for Symptoms of Menopause | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 94 | issue = 11 | pages = 884–889 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27929271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may, however, be associated with appetite and sleeping problems, constipation and nausea.&lt;ref name=Kra2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Potter B, Schrager S, Dalby J, Torell E, Hampton A | title = Menopause | journal = Primary Care | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 625–641 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30401346 | doi = 10.1016/j.pop.2018.08.001 | series = Women’s Health }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gabapentin]] or [[clonidine]] may help but do not work as well as hormone therapy.&lt;ref name=Kra2015/&gt; Gabapentin can decrease the amount of hot flashes. Side effects associated with its use include drowsiness and headaches. Clonidine is used to improve vasomotor symptoms and may be associated with constipation, dizziness, nausea and sleeping problems.&lt;ref name=Kra2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

=== Therapy ===

One review found [[mindfulness]] and [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] decreases the amount women are affected by hot flushes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Driel CM, Stuursma A, Schroevers MJ, Mourits MJ, de Bock GH | title = Mindfulness, cognitive behavioural and behaviour-based therapy for natural and treatment-induced menopausal symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BJOG | volume = 126 | issue = 3 | pages = 330–339 | date = February 2019 | pmid = 29542222 | pmc = 6585818 | doi = 10.1111/1471-0528.15153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review found not enough evidence to make a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldstein KM, Shepherd-Banigan M, Coeytaux RR, McDuffie JR, Adam S, Befus D, Goode AP, Kosinski AS, Masilamani V, Williams JW | display-authors = 6 | title = Use of mindfulness, meditation and relaxation to treat vasomotor symptoms | journal = Climacteric | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 178–182 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28286985 | doi = 10.1080/13697137.2017.1283685 | s2cid = 10446084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise ===
Exercise has been thought to reduce postmenopausal symptoms through the increase of endorphin levels, which decrease as estrogen production decreases.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hickey M, Szabo RA, Hunter MS | title = Non-hormonal treatments for menopausal symptoms | journal = BMJ | volume = 359 | pages = j5101 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29170264 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.j5101 | s2cid = 46856968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, high [[Body mass index|BMI]] is a risk factor for vasomotor symptoms in particular. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the benefits of weight loss for symptom management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore TR, Franks RB, Fox C | title = Review of Efficacy of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments for Menopausal Symptoms | journal = Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 286–297 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28561959 | doi = 10.1111/jmwh.12628 | s2cid = 4756342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are mixed perspectives on the benefits of physical exercise. While one review found that there was a lack of quality evidence supporting a benefit of exercise,&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; another review recommended regular healthy exercise to reduce comorbidities, improve mood and anxiety symptoms, enhance cognition, and decrease the risk of fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grindler NM, Santoro NF | title = Menopause and exercise | journal = Menopause | volume = 22 | issue = 12 | pages = 1351–8 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26382311 | doi = 10.1097/GME.0000000000000536 | s2cid = 27802470 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga may help with postmenopausal symptoms similar to other exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cramer H, Peng W, Lauche R | title = Yoga for menopausal symptoms-A systematic review and meta-analysis | language = en | journal = Maturitas | volume = 109 | pages = 13–25 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29452777 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2017.12.005 | url = https://www.maturitas.org/article/S0378-5122(17)31026-5/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other efforts===
*Lack of lubrication is a common problem during and after perimenopause. Vaginal moisturizers can help women with overall dryness, and lubricants can help with lubrication difficulties that may be present during intercourse. It is worth pointing out that moisturizers and lubricants are different products for different issues: some women complain that their genitalia are uncomfortably dry all the time, and they may do better with moisturizers. Those who need only lubricants do well using them only during intercourse.
*Low-dose prescription vaginal estrogen products such as estrogen creams are generally a safe way to use estrogen topically, to help vaginal thinning and dryness problems (see [[vaginal atrophy]]) while only minimally increasing the levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.
*In terms of managing hot flashes, lifestyle measures such as drinking cold liquids, staying in cool rooms, using fans, removing excess clothing, and avoiding hot flash triggers such as hot drinks, spicy foods, etc., may partially supplement (or even obviate) the use of medications for some women.
*Individual counseling or support groups can sometimes be helpful to handle sad, depressed, anxious or confused feelings women may be having as they pass through what can be for some a very challenging transition time.
*[[Osteoporosis]] can be minimized by [[smoking cessation]], adequate [[vitamin D]] intake and regular weight-bearing exercise. The bisphosphonate drug alendronate may decrease the risk of a fracture, in women that have both bone loss and a previous fracture and less so for those with just osteoporosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells GA, Cranney A, Peterson J, Boucher M, Shea B, Robinson V, Coyle D, Tugwell P | title = Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 1 | pages = CD001155 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18253985 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001155.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A surgical procedure where a part of one of the ovaries is removed earlier in life and frozen and then over time thawed and returned to the body has been tried.

==Society and culture==
The cultural context within which a woman lives can have a significant impact on the way she experiences the menopausal transition. Menopause has been described as a subjective experience, with social and cultural factors playing a prominent role in the way menopause is experienced and perceived.

The word menopause was invented by French doctors at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Some of them noted that peasant women had no complaints about the end of menses, while urban middle-class women had many troubling symptoms. Doctors at this time considered the symptoms to be the result of urban lifestyles of sedentary behaviour, alcohol consumption, too much time indoors, and over-eating, with a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore AM | year = 2018| title = Conceptual Layers in the Invention of Menopause in Nineteenth-Century France | journal = French History | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 226–248 | doi = 10.1093/fh/cry006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the United States, social location affects the way women perceive menopause and its related biological effects. Research indicates that whether a woman views menopause as a medical issue or an expected life change is correlated with her socio-economic status.&lt;ref&gt;Winterich, J. (August 2008). &quot;Gender, medicine, and the menopausal body: How biology and culture influence women's experiences with menopause&quot;.

Ethnicity and geography play roles in the experience of menopause. American women of different ethnicities report significantly different types of menopausal effects. One major study found Caucasian women most likely to report what are sometimes described as psychosomatic symptoms, while African-American women were more likely to report vasomotor symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Avis N, Stellato RC, Bromberger J, Gan P, Cain V, Kagawa-Singer M | year = 2001 | title = Is there a menopausal syndrome?

It seems that Japanese women experience menopause effects, or ''konenki'', in a different way from American women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lock 1998, pp. 410&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lock M | title = Menopause: lessons from anthropology | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 410–9 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9710286 | doi = 10.1097/00006842-199807000-00005 | s2cid = 38878080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese women report lower rates of hot flashes and night sweats; this can be attributed to a variety of factors, both biological and social. Historically, konenki was associated with wealthy middle-class housewives in Japan, i.e., it was a &quot;luxury disease&quot; that women from traditional, inter-generational rural households did not report. Menopause in Japan was viewed as a symptom of the inevitable process of aging, rather than a &quot;revolutionary transition&quot;, or a &quot;deficiency disease&quot; in need of management.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lock 1998, pp. 410&quot;/&gt;

In Japanese culture, reporting of vasomotor symptoms has been on the increase, with research conducted by Melissa Melby in 2005 finding that of 140 Japanese participants, hot flashes were prevalent in 22.1%.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16154301&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Melby MK | title = Factor analysis of climacteric symptoms in Japan | journal = Maturitas | volume = 52 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 205–22 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16154301 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2005.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was almost double that of 20 years prior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lock, M 2010, p.87&quot;&gt;Lock, M. &amp; Nguyen, V.

Additionally, while most women in the United States apparently have a negative view of menopause as a time of deterioration or decline, some studies seem to indicate that women from some Asian cultures have an understanding of menopause that focuses on a sense of liberation and celebrates the freedom from the risk of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maoz B, Dowty N, Antonovsky A, Wisjenbeck H | year = 1970 | title = Female attitudes to menopause | journal = Social Psychiatry | volume = 5 | pages = 35–40 | doi = 10.1007/BF01539794 | s2cid = 30147685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Diverging from these conclusions, one study appeared to show that many American women &quot;experience this time as one of liberation and [[self-actualization]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stotland NL | title = Menopause: social expectations, women's realities | journal = Archives of Women's Mental Health | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–8 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12503068 | doi = 10.1007/s007370200016 | s2cid = 9248759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Menopause literally means the &quot;end of monthly cycles&quot; (the end of [[monthly period]]s or [[menstruation]]), from the Greek word ''pausis'' (&quot;pause&quot;) and ''mēn'' (&quot;month&quot;). This is a medical [[calque]]; the Greek word for [[menses]] is actually different. In Ancient Greek, the [[menses]] were described in the plural, ''ta emmēnia'', (&quot;the monthlies&quot;), and its modern descendant has been clipped to ''ta emmēna''. The Modern Greek medical term is ''emmenopausis'' in [[Katharevousa]] or ''emmenopausi'' in [[Demotic Greek]].

The word &quot;menopause&quot; was coined specifically for human females, where the end of fertility is traditionally indicated by the permanent stopping of monthly menstruations. However, menopause exists in some other animals, many of which do not have monthly menstruation;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker ML, Herndon JG | title = Menopause in nonhuman primates? | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 398–406 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18495681 | pmc = 2553520 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod.108.068536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in this case, the term means a natural end to fertility that occurs before the end of the natural lifespan.

==Evolutionary rationale==
{{see also|Disposable soma theory of aging|Patriarch hypothesis}}
Few animals have a menopause: humans are joined by just four other species in which females live substantially longer than their ability to reproduce.  The others are all [[cetaceans]]: [[beluga whales]], [[narwhal]]s, [[killer whales]] and [[short-finned pilot whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/08/27/beluga-whales-narwhals-go-through-menopause-too/ | title=Beluga Whales and Narwhals Go Through the Menopause Too|date=2018-08-27 | author = Ben Guarino | access-date=2019-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various theories have been suggested that attempt to suggest evolutionary benefits to the human species stemming from the cessation of women's reproductive capability before the end of their natural lifespan. Explanations can be categorized as adaptive and non-adaptive:

===Non-adaptive hypotheses===

The high cost of female investment in offspring may lead to physiological deteriorations that amplify susceptibility to becoming infertile. This hypothesis suggests the reproductive lifespan in humans has been optimized, but it has proven more difficult in females and thus their reproductive span is shorter. If this hypothesis were true, however, age at menopause should be negatively correlated with reproductive effort,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaulin SJ | year = 1980 | title = Sexual Dimorphism in the Human Post-reproductive Life-span: Possible Causes | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 227–32 | doi = 10.1016/0047-2484(80)90024-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the available data do not support this.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, I. (1970), &quot;Fecundity, Fertility and Family Planning&quot;. Demography Institute University of Gothenburg Reports. 10: pp. 1–109&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent increase in female [[longevity]] due to improvements in the standard of living and social care has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Washburn, S.L. (1981). &quot;Longevity in Primates&quot;. In: Aging: Biology and Behavior by McGaugh, J.L. and S. B. Kiesler, S.B. (eds). pp. 11–29. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult for selection, however, to favor aid to offspring from parents and grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes K | title = Human longevity: the grandmother effect | journal = Nature | volume = 428 | issue = 6979 | pages = 128–9 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15014476 | doi = 10.1038/428128a | bibcode = 2004Natur.428..128H | s2cid = 4342536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irrespective of living standards, adaptive responses are limited by physiological mechanisms. In other words, [[senescence]] is programmed and regulated by specific genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ricklefs RE, Wikelski M | year = 2002 | title = The Physiology/Life-history Nexus | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 17 | issue = 10| pages = 462–68 | doi = 10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02578-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early human selection shadow====
While it is fairly common for extant hunter-gatherers to live past age 50 provided that they survive childhood, fossil evidence shows that mortality in adults has decreased over the last 30,000 to 50,000 years and that it was extremely unusual for early ''Homo sapiens'' to live to age 50. This discovery has led some biologists to argue that there was no selection for or against menopause at the time at which the ancestor of all modern humans lived in Africa, suggesting that menopause is instead a random evolutionary effect of a [[selection shadow]] regarding aging in early ''Homo sapiens''. It is also argued that since the population fraction of post-menopausal women in early ''Homo sapiens'' was so low, menopause had no evolutionary effect on mate selection or social behaviors related to mate selection.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How Women Got Their Curves and Other Just-So Stories: Evolutionary Enigmas&quot;, David Barash, David P.

===Adaptive hypotheses===

====&quot;Survival of the fittest&quot; hypothesis====
This hypothesis suggests that younger mothers and offspring under their care will fare better in a difficult and predatory environment because a younger mother will be stronger and more agile in providing protection and sustenance for herself and a nursing baby. The various biological factors associated with menopause had the effect of male members of the species investing their effort with the most viable of potential female mates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Origin of Species&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|name-list-style=vanc|title=Origin of Species|url=http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species/|access-date=24 September 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003145126/http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species/|archive-date=3 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2016}} One problem with this hypothesis is that we would expect to see menopause exhibited in the animal kingdom,&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker2&quot;/&gt; and another problem is that in the case of extended child development, even a female who was relatively young, still agile, and attractive when producing a child would lose future support from her male partner due to him seeking out fertile mates when she reaches menopause while the child is still not independent. That would be counterproductive to the supposed adaptation of getting male support as a fertile female and ruin survival for children produced over much of the female's fertile and agile life, unless children were raised in ways that did not rely on support from a male partner which would eliminate that type of resource diverting selection anyway.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A View to a Kill: Investigating Middle Palaeolithic Subsistence Using an Optimal Foraging perspective&quot;, Gerrit Leendert Dusseldorp 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Journey of Adulthood&quot;, Helen L. Bee, Barbara R. Bjorklund 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Young female preference hypothesis ====
The young female preference hypothesis proposes that changes in male preferences for younger mates allowed late-age acting fertility [[mutation]]s to accumulate in females without any evolutionary penalty, giving rise to menopause. A computer model was constructed to test this hypothesis, and showed that it was feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton RA, Stone JR, Singh RS | title = Mate choice and the origin of menopause | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = e1003092 | date = 2013-06-13 | pmid = 23785268 | pmc = 3681637 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003092 | bibcode = 2013PLSCB...9E3092M }}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, in order for deleterious mutations that affect fertility past roughly age fifty to accumulate, human maximum lifespan had to first be extended to about its present value. As of 2016 it was unclear if there has been sufficient time since that happened for such an evolutionary process to occur.&lt;ref name=Takahashi2016&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi M, Singh RS, Stone J | title = A Theory for the Origin of Human Menopause | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 7 | pages = 222 | date = 2017-01-06 | pmid = 28111590 | pmc = 5216033 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2016.00222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Male-biased philopatry hypothesis ====
The male-biased [[philopatry]] theory proposes that male-biased philopatry in social species leads to increased relatedness to the group in relation to female age, making inclusive fitness benefits older females receive from helping the group greater than what they would receive from continued reproduction, which eventually led to the evolution of menopause.&lt;ref name = &quot;Johnstone_2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnstone RA, Cant MA | title = The evolution of menopause in cetaceans and humans: the role of demography | journal = Proceedings. Biological Sciences | volume = 277 | issue = 1701 | pages = 3765–71 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20591868 | pmc = 2992708 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2010.0988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pattern of male-biased dispersal and local mating, the relatedness of the individuals in the group decreases with female age, leading to a decrease in [[kin selection]] with female age.&lt;ref name = &quot;Johnstone_2010&quot; /&gt; This occurs because a female will stay with her father in her natal group throughout life, initially being closely related to the males and females. Females are born and stay in the group, so relatedness to the females stays about the same. However, throughout time, the older male relatives will die and any sons she gives birth to will disperse, so that local relatedness to males, and therefore the whole group, declines. The situation is reversed in species where males are philopatric and either females disperse, or mating is non-local.&lt;ref name = &quot;Johnstone_2010&quot; /&gt; Under these conditions, a female's reproductive life begins away from her father and paternal relatives because she was either born into a new group from non-local mating or because she dispersed. In the case of female-biased dispersal, the female is initially equally unrelated with every individual in the group, and with non-local mating, the female is closely related to the females of the group, but not the males since her paternal relatives are in another group. As she gives birth, her sons will stay with her, increasing her relatedness to males in the group overtime and thus her relatedness with the overall group. The common feature that connects these two otherwise different behaviors is male-biased philopatry, which leads to an increase in kin selection with female age.

While not conclusive, evidence does exist to support the idea that female-biased dispersal existed in pre-modern humans. The closest living relatives to humans, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, [[bonobo]]s, and both [[mountain gorilla]]s and [[western lowland gorilla]]s, are female-biased dispersers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handley LJ 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawson Handley LJ, Perrin N | title = Advances in our understanding of mammalian sex-biased dispersal | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 1559–78 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17402974 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294x.2006.03152.x | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of sex specific genetic material, the non-recombining portions of the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA, show evidence of a prevalence of female-biased dispersal as well; however, these results could also be affected by the effective breeding numbers of males and females in local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ségurel L, Martínez-Cruz B, Quintana-Murci L, Balaresque P, Georges M, Hegay T, Aldashev A, Nasyrova F, Jobling MA, Heyer E, Vitalis R | title = Sex-specific genetic structure and social organization in Central Asia: insights from a multi-locus study | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = e1000200 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18818760 | pmc = 2535577 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of female-biased dispersion in hunter-gatherers is not definitive, with some studies supporting the idea,&lt;ref name=&quot;Handley LJ 2006&quot;/&gt; and others suggesting there is no strong bias towards either sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sugiyama Y | title = Sex-biased dispersal of human ancestors | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 172–180 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28815964 | doi = 10.1002/evan.21539 | s2cid = 19996159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[killer whale]]s, both sexes mate non-locally with members of a different pod but return to the pod after copulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Bigg MA, Olesiuk PF, Ellis GM, Ford JK, Balcomb KC | title = Social organization and genealogy of resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington State. | journal = Report of the International Whaling Commission | volume = 12 | pages = 383–405 |date=1990-01-01 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279895908 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographic data shows that a female's mean relatedness to the group does increase over time due to increasing relatedness to males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croft DP 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Croft DP, Johnstone RA, Ellis S, Nattrass S, Franks DW, Brent LJ, Mazzi S, Balcomb KC, Ford JK, Cant MA | title = Reproductive Conflict and the Evolution of Menopause in Killer Whales | language = en | journal = Current Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 298–304 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28089514 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2016.12.015 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; While less well-studied, there is evidence that [[short-finned pilot whale]]s, another menopausal species, also display this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | vauthors = Heimlich-Boran JR | title = Social organisation of the short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus, with special reference to the comparative social ecology of delphinids |date=1993 | degree = Doctoral | publisher = University of Cambridge |url=http://aquaticcommons.org/4005/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mating behavior that increases local relatedness with female age is prevalent in non-menopausal species,&lt;ref name=&quot;Handley LJ 2006&quot;/&gt; making it unlikely that it is the only factor that determines if menopause will evolve in a species.

====Mother hypothesis====

The mother hypothesis suggests that menopause was selected for humans because of the extended development period of human offspring and high costs of reproduction so that mothers gain an advantage in reproductive fitness by redirecting their effort from new offspring with a low survival chance to existing children with a higher survival chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peccei JS | year = 2001 | title = Menopause: Adaptation or Epiphenomenon? | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 43–57 | doi = 10.1002/evan.1013 | s2cid = 1665503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grandmother hypothesis====

The [[grandmother hypothesis]] suggests that menopause was selected for humans because it promotes the survival of grandchildren. According to this hypothesis, post-reproductive women feed and care for children, adult nursing daughters, and grandchildren whose mothers have weaned them. Human babies require large and steady supplies of glucose to feed the growing brain. In infants in the first year of life, the brain consumes 60% of all calories, so both babies and their mothers require a dependable food supply. Some evidence suggests that hunters contribute less than half the total food budget of most hunter-gatherer societies, and often much less than half, so that foraging grandmothers can contribute substantially to the survival of grandchildren at times when mothers and fathers are unable to gather enough food for all of their children. In general, selection operates most powerfully during times of famine or other privation. So although grandmothers might not be necessary during good times, many grandchildren cannot survive without them during times of famine. 

Post-reproductive female killer whales tend to lead their pods, especially during years of food scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brent LJ, Franks DW, Foster EA, Balcomb KC, Cant MA, Croft DP | title = Ecological knowledge, leadership, and the evolution of menopause in killer whales | journal = Current Biology | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 746–750 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25754636 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2015.01.037 | s2cid = 3488959 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.01.037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the increased mortality risk of a killer whale individual due to losing a grandmother is stronger in years food scarcity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nattrass S, Croft DP, Ellis S, Cant MA, Weiss MN, Wright BM, Stredulinsky E, Doniol-Valcroze T, Ford JK, Balcomb KC, Franks DW | display-authors = 6 | title = Postreproductive killer whale grandmothers improve the survival of their grandoffspring | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 116 | issue = 52 | pages = 26669–26673 | date = December 2019 | pmid = 31818941 | pmc = 6936675 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1903844116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of historical data found that the length of a female's post-reproductive lifespan was reflected in the reproductive success of her offspring and the survival of her grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lahdenperä M, Lummaa V, Helle S, Tremblay M, Russell AF | title = Fitness benefits of prolonged post-reproductive lifespan in women | journal = Nature | volume = 428 | issue = 6979 | pages = 178–81 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15014499 | doi = 10.1038/nature02367 | bibcode = 2004Natur.428..178L | s2cid = 4415832 | url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/104/1/lummaav1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found comparative effects but only in the maternal grandmother—paternal grandmothers had a detrimental effect on infant mortality (probably due to paternity uncertainty).&lt;ref&gt;Voland, E. and Beise, J. (2002). &quot;Opposite Effects of Maternal and Paternal Grandmothers on Infant Survival in Historical Krummörn&quot;. MPIDR WP 2001–026.&lt;/ref&gt; Differing assistance strategies for maternal and paternal grandmothers have also been demonstrated. Maternal grandmothers concentrate on offspring survival, whereas paternal grandmothers increase birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Mace R, Sear R | date = 2004 | chapter = Are Humans Communal Breeders? | veditors = Voland E, Chasiotis A, Schiefenhoevel W | title = Grandmotherhood – the Evolutionary Significance of the Second Half of Female Life | publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe a problem concerning the grandmother hypothesis is that it requires a history of female [[philopatry]], while in the present day the majority of hunter-gatherer societies are [[patrilocal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peccei JS | title = A critique of the grandmother hypotheses: old and new | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 434–52 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11400215 | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.1076 | s2cid = 23875936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is disagreement split along ideological lines about whether [[patrilineality]] would have existed before modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libcom.org/history/engels-was-right-early-human-kinship-was-matrilineal|title=Engels was Right: Early Human Kinship was Matrilineal|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227062103/http://libcom.org/history/engels-was-right-early-human-kinship-was-matrilineal|archive-date=27 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe variations on the mother, or grandmother effect fail to explain longevity with continued spermatogenesis in males (oldest verified paternity is 94 years, 35 years beyond the oldest documented birth attributed to females).&lt;ref&gt;10. Finch, C.E. 1990. Longevity senescence and the genome. University of Chicago Press. London.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the survival time past menopause is roughly the same as the maturation time for a human child. That a mother's presence could aid in the survival of a developing child, while an unidentified father's absence might not have affected survival, could explain the paternal fertility near the end of the father's lifespan.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17492968&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pavard S, Sibert A, Heyer E | title = The effect of maternal care on child survival: a demographic, genetic, and evolutionary perspective | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 1153–61 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17492968 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00086.x | s2cid = 13118937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A man with no certainty of which children are his may merely attempt to father additional children, with support of existing children present but small.

The theories discussed above assume that evolution directly selected for menopause. Another theory states that menopause is the byproduct of the evolutionary selection for [[follicular atresia]], a factor that causes menopause. Menopause results from having too few ovarian follicles to produce enough estrogen to maintain the ovarian-pituitary-hypothalamic loop, which results in the cessation of menses and the beginning of menopause. Human females are born with approximately a million oocytes, and approximately 400 oocytes are lost to ovulation throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;Leidy, L. &quot;Menopause in evolutionary perspective&quot;. in: Trevathan WR, McKenna JJ, Smith EO (Eds.)

===== Reproductive conflict hypothesis =====
In social [[vertebrate]]s, the sharing of resources among the group places limits on how many offspring can be produced and supported by members of the group. This creates a situation in which each female must compete with others of the group to ensure they are the one that reproduces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clutton-Brock TH, Hodge SJ, Spong G, Russell AF, Jordan NR, Bennett NC, Sharpe LL, Manser MB | title = Intrasexual competition and sexual selection in cooperative mammals | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7122 | pages = 1065–8 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17183322 | doi = 10.1038/nature05386 | bibcode = 2006Natur.444.1065C | s2cid = 4397323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive conflict hypothesis proposes that this female reproductive conflict favors the cessation of female reproductive potential in older age to avoid reproductive conflict, increasing the older female's fitness through [[Inclusive fitness|inclusive]] benefits. Female-biased dispersal or non-local mating leads to an increase in relatedness to the social group with female age.&lt;ref name = &quot;Johnstone_2010&quot; /&gt; In the human case of female-biased dispersal, when a young female enters a new group, she is not related to any individual and she reproduces to produce an offspring with a [[Coefficient of relationship|relatedness]] of 0.5. An older female could also choose to reproduce, producing an offspring with a relatedness of 0.5, or she could refrain from reproducing and allow another pair to reproduce. Because her relatedness to males in the group is high, there is a fair probability that the offspring will be her grandchild with a relatedness of 0.25. The younger female experiences no cost to her inclusive fitness from using the resources necessary to successfully rear offspring since she is not related to members of the group, but there is a cost for the older female. As a result, the younger female has the advantage in reproductive competition. Although a female killer whale born into a social group is related to some members of the group, the whale case of non-local mating leads to similar outcomes because the younger female relatedness to the group as a whole is less than the relatedness of the older female. This behavior makes more likely the cessation of reproduction late in life to avoid reproductive conflict with younger females.

Research using both human and killer whale demographic data has been published that supports the role of reproductive conflict in the evolution of menopause. Analysis of demographic data from pre-industrial Finnish populations found significant reductions in offspring survivorship when mothers-in-laws and daughters-in-laws had overlapping births,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lahdenperä M, Gillespie DO, Lummaa V, Russell AF | title = Severe intergenerational reproductive conflict and the evolution of menopause | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 1283–1290 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22913671 | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01851.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the idea that avoiding reproductive conflict is beneficial to offspring survivorship. Humans, more so than other primates, rely on food sharing for survival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaeggi AV, Gurven M | title = Natural cooperators: food sharing in humans and other primates | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 186–95 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23943272 | doi = 10.1002/evan.21364 | s2cid = 25989629 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/3446988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so the large survivorship reduction values could be caused by a straining of community resources. Avoiding such straining is a possible explanation for why the reproductive overlap seen in humans is much lower than other primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cant MA, Johnstone RA | title = Reproductive conflict and the separation of reproductive generations in humans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 14 | pages = 5332–6 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18378891 | pmc = 2291103 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0711911105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.5332C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Food sharing is also prevalent among another menopausal species, killer whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Wright BM, Stredulinsky EH, Ellis GM, Ford JK | title = Kin-directed food sharing promotes lifetime natal philopatry of both sexes in a population of fish-eating killer whales, Orcinus orca. | journal = Animal Behaviour | date = May 2016 | volume = 115 | pages = 81–95 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.02.025 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive conflict has also been observed in killer whales, with increased calf mortality seen when reproductive overlap between a younger and older generational female occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croft DP 2016&quot;/&gt;

==Other animals==
Menopause in the animal kingdom appears to be uncommon, but the presence of this phenomenon in different species has not been thoroughly researched. [[Biological life cycle|Life histories]] show a varying degree of [[senescence]]; rapid senescing organisms (e.g., [[Pacific salmon]] and [[annual plants]]) do not have a post-reproductive life-stage. Gradual senescence is exhibited by all [[placental mammal]]ian life histories.

Menopause has been observed in several species of nonhuman [[primates]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker2&quot;/&gt; including [[rhesus monkeys]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker ML | title = Menopause in female rhesus monkeys | journal = American Journal of Primatology | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–71 | year = 1995 | pmid = 31924061 | doi = 10.1002/ajp.1350350106 | s2cid = 83848539 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, D.

Dogs do not experience menopause; the [[Canine reproduction#The reproductive cycle|canine estrus cycle]] simply becomes irregular and infrequent. Although older female dogs are not considered good candidates for breeding, offspring have been produced by older animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Canine reproduction]]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar observations have been made in cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/how-long-is-a-cat-in-heat/ |title=How long is a cat in heat?|date=2012-05-15|work=Animal Planet|access-date=2018-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice N' Chains soon disbanded, and Staley joined a [[funk]] band.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS 1992&quot;/&gt; Cantrell's band, Diamond Lie, broke up and he wanted to form a new band, so Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer [[Sean Kinney]], so that Cantrell could talk to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;/&gt; Cantrell called the number and set up a meeting with Kinney.&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;/&gt; Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell's demos, who mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them, and he had someone in mind: [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]], with whom Cantrell had played in a band in [[Burien]] called Gypsy Rose.&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;/&gt; Kinney then mentioned that his girlfriend was actually Mike Starr's sister, and that he had been playing in bands together with Starr since they were kids.&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;/&gt; Kinney called Starr and a few days later he started jamming with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank, but they didn't have a singer.&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;/&gt;

Staley's funk band also required a guitarist at the time, and Staley asked Cantrell to join as a [[sideman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RS 1992&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Layne Staley 1996 Interview&quot;/&gt; Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band. Because Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted Staley to be their lead singer, they started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint.&lt;ref name=&quot;Layne Staley 1996 Interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guitar World 2013&quot;/&gt; The last straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper – he decided to join the band after that.&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;/&gt; Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Layne Staley 1996 Interview&quot;/&gt; Two weeks after the band's formation, they were playing a gig at the [[University of Washington]], trying to fill out a 40-minute set with a couple of original songs along with [[Hanoi Rocks]] and [[David Bowie]] covers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guitar World 2013&quot;/&gt;

The band played a couple of gigs in clubs around the Pacific Northwest, calling themselves different monikers, including Diamond Lie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bacus.net/alice/images/diamond.htm|title=Diamond Lie Press Kit|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name of Cantrell's previous band,&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview Alice In Chains - Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney (part 2)&quot;&gt;{{YouTube|WOZjcOCrepk|Interview Alice In Chains - Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney (part 2)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Fuck,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;/&gt; before eventually adopting the name that Staley's previous band had initially flirted with, ''Alice in Chains''.&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Bank&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media notes| title=[[Music Bank (album)|Music Bank]]| year=1999 |publisher=[[Columbia Records]] | id=69580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Link with Brutality&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Link With Brutality | author=Kleidermacher, Mordechai |date=July 1990 |journal=[[Circus Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staley contacted his former bandmates and asked for permission to use the name.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 79&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Sola|first1=David|title=Alice in Chains: The Untold Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUonBgAAQBAJ |date=August 4, 2015|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=978-1250048073|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Pollock wasn't particularly thrilled about it at the time and thought he should come up with a different name, but ultimately both he and James Bergstrom gave Staley their blessing to use the name.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 79&quot;/&gt;

Local promoter Randy Hauser became aware of the band at a concert and offered to pay for [[Demo (music)|demo]] recordings. However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest cannabis raid in the history of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Bank&quot;/&gt; The final demo, completed in 1988, was named ''The Treehouse Tapes'' and found its way to the music managers Kelly Curtis and [[Susan Silver]], who also managed the Seattle-based band [[Soundgarden]]. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to [[Columbia Records]]' [[A&amp;R]] representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president [[Don Ienner]]. Based on ''The Treehouse Tapes'', Terzo signed Alice in Chains to Columbia in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Bank&quot;/&gt; The band also recorded another untitled demo over a three-month period in 1989.

Alice in Chains soon became a top priority of the label, which released the band's first official recording in July 1990, a promotional [[Extended play|EP]] called ''[[We Die Young]]''. The EP's lead single, &quot;[[We Die Young]],&quot; became a hit on metal radio. After its success, the label rushed Alice in Chains' debut album into production with producer [[Dave Jerden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AiC Dirt&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/dirt.aspx| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703145800/http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/dirt.aspx| archive-date=July 3, 2006 |title=Discography – ''Dirt'' |publisher=Aliceinchains.com |accessdate=February 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantrell stated the album was intended to have a &quot;moody aura&quot; that was a &quot;direct result of the brooding atmosphere and feel of Seattle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who is Alice and why is She in Chains?&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Moses, Michael |date=September 1991 |title=Alice in Chains: Who is Alice and Why is She in Chains? |journal=Rockbeat Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1992, the band returned to the studio. With new songs written primarily on the road, the material has an overall darker feel than ''Facelift'', with six of the album's thirteen songs dealing with the subject of addiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digging Dirt&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 1993 |author =Turman, Katherine |title=Digging Dirt |journal=RIP Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We did a lot of soul searching on this album.

On September 29, 1992, Alice in Chains released its second album, ''[[Dirt (Alice in Chains album)|Dirt]]''.

|quote=That darkness was always part of the band, but it wasn't ''all'' about that. There was always an optimism, even in the darkest shit we wrote. With ''Dirt'', it's not like we were saying 'Oh yeah, this is a good thing.' It was more of a warning than anything else, rather than 'Hey, come and check this out, it's great!' We were talking about what was going on at the time, but within that there was always a survivor element – a kind of triumph over the darker elements of being a human being. I still think we have all of that intact, but maybe the percentage has shifted.

The song was featured on the soundtrack to the 1998 [[horror film|horror]]/[[Science fiction|sci-fi]] film, ''[[The Faculty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Sola|first1=David|title=Alice in Chains: The Untold Story|date=August 4, 2015|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=978-1250048073|pages=277–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After they toured as part of Cantrell's solo band in 1998, Sean Kinney and [[Queensrÿche]] guitarist [[Chris DeGarmo]] formed a new band called [[Spys4Darwin]]. Mike Inez and [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]] lead vocalist [[Vin Dombroski]] joined the supergroup soon after. The band released their first and only album in 2001, a 6-track EP entitled ''Microfish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=104499&amp;page=1 |title=Rockers Team Up in Spys4Darwin |date=May 31, 2001 |website=ABC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409122016/https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=104499&amp;page=1 |archive-date=April 9, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, Mike Inez joined [[Zakk Wylde]]'s [[Black Label Society]] for the remaining dates of [[Ozzfest]], following the departure of bassist [[Steve Gibb]] due to medical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1444508/zakk-wylde-taps-aics-inez-for-ozzfest/ |title=Zakk Wylde Taps AIC's Inez For Ozzfest |date=June 14, 2001 |website=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inez joined the band again for their West Coast and Japanese tour in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-ozzy-alice-in-chains-bassist-to-tour-with-black-label-society/ |title=Former OZZY/ALICE IN CHAINS Bassist To Tour With BLACK LABEL SOCIETY |date=March 5, 2003 |website=Blabbermouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002, Cantrell had finished work on his second solo album, ''[[Degradation Trip]]''. Written in 1998, the album's lyrical content focused heavily on what Cantrell regarded as the demise of Alice in Chains, which still remained evident as the album approached its June 2002 release. However, in March that year, Cantrell commented, &quot;We're all still around, so it's possible [Alice in Chains] could all do something someday, and I fully hope someday we will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Wiederhorn| first=Jon |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452982/20020319/cantrell_jerry.jhtml | title=Jerry Cantrell Conjures Ghost Of Alice In Chains On New LP | publisher=MTV | date=March 20, 2002 | accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the band's hiatus in a 2011 interview, Kinney said that Staley wasn't the only one battling addiction. &quot;He was the focal point, like singers are. So they'd single him out. But the truth was, it was pretty much everybody. I definitely had my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – you know when you stop when you have two #1 records, it's not really the greatest career move – but we did that because we love each other and we didn't want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn't be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn't have made it. I just wouldn't have.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;From The Ashes&quot;/&gt;

After a decade of battling drug addiction, Layne Staley was found dead in his condominium in Seattle on April 19, 2002. The autopsy and toxicology report on Staley's body revealed that he died from a mixture of heroin and cocaine, known as &quot;[[Speedball (drug)|speedball]].&quot; The autopsy concluded that Staley died on April 5, two weeks before his body was found.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1453818/layne-staley-died-from-mix-of-heroin-cocaine-report-says/ |title=Layne Staley Died From Mix Of Heroin, Cocaine, Report Says |publisher=MTV |date=May 7, 2002|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Charles R. | last = Cross | title = The last days of Layne Staley; Alice in Chains singer dies at thirty-four after long battle with heroin | date = June 6, 2002 | work = ROLLING STONE no. 897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantrell dedicated his 2002 solo album, ''Degradation Trip'', released two months after Staley's death, to his memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roadrunner Cantrell&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/artists/JerryCantrell/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119070122/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/artists/JerryCantrell/| archive-date=January 19, 2008 |title=Well Worth The Trip |date=December 24, 2002 |publisher=Roadrunner Records UK |accessdate=December 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Starr later claimed on ''[[Celebrity Rehab]]'' that he was the last person to see Staley alive, and admitted to feeling guilty about not calling 911 after Staley had warned him against it. &quot;I wish I hadn't been high on benzodiazepine [that night], I wouldn't have just walked out the door,&quot; Starr said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone 1994&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Alice in Chains rocker Mike Starr dies|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aliceinchains-idUSTRE72802X20110309|website=Reuters|accessdate=August 6, 2017|date=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2004, [[Sony BMG]] terminated their contract with Alice in Chains, 15 years after the band signed with the label, in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Sola|first1=David|title=Alice in Chains: The Untold Story|date=August 4, 2015|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=978-1250048073|pages=323–324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Sean Kinney came up with the idea of doing a benefit concert for the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami disaster]] that struck South Asia in 2004. Kinney made calls to his former bandmates, as well as friends in the music community, such as former Alice in Chains manager Susan Silver. Kinney was surprised by the enthusiastic response to his idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/entertainment/music/article/Kinney-drums-up-enthusiastic-response-for-tsunami-1166652.php|title=Kinney drums up enthusiastic response for tsunami benefit |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=February 17, 2005|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, 2005, Jerry Cantrell, Mike Inez, and Sean Kinney reunited to perform for the first time in  nine years at ''K-Rock Tsunami Continued Care Relief Concert'' in Seattle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benefit concert&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author=Hay, Travis |date=February 21, 2005 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/pop/212872_alice21q.html |title=Alice in Chains owns stage in tsunami-relief show full of surprises |publisher=Seattlepi.com|accessdate=November 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band featured [[Damageplan]] vocalist [[Pat Lachman]], as well as other special guests including [[Maynard James Keenan]] of [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and [[Ann Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Benefit concert&quot;/&gt; A few months after that experience, the band called Susan Silver and Cantrell's manager [[Bill Siddons]] and said they wanted to tour as Alice in Chains again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pollstarpro.com/live2010/panelband.htm|title=Putting The Band Back Together|work=PollstarPro|date=February 17, 2010|accessdate=November 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204214139/http://www.pollstarpro.com/live2010/panelband.htm|archive-date=February 4, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice in Chains was approached by the producers of the [[CBS]] reality show ''[[Rock Star (TV series)|Rock Star]]'' about being featured on its second season, but the band turned the offer down.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV reunion article&quot;/&gt; In the show, aspiring singers competed to become the lead vocalist of a featured group.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV reunion article&quot;/&gt;

Cantrell revealed that before he suggested DuVall for the band, Sean Kinney and Mike Inez invited [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]] and [[Spys4Darwin]] lead vocalist [[Vin Dombroski]] to jam with the band in their rehearsal space.

Cantrell explained the reunion saying, &quot;We want to celebrate what we did and the memory of our friend. We have played with some [singers] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [Staley's] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the [[Led Zeppelin]] approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing to take a chance on it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV reunion article&quot;/&gt; Before the tour, Kinney mentioned in an interview that he would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV reunion article&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524813/02232006/alice_in_chains.jhtml |title=Remaining Alice In Chains Members Reuniting For Summer Gigs |publisher=MTV |author =Harris, Chris |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=November 24, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071218124026/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524813/02232006/alice_in_chains.jhtml| archive-date= December 18, 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

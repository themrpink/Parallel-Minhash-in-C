Two later editions were published by Newton:

===Second edition, 1713===
[[File:Principia Mathematica 1713.JPG|thumb|Second edition opened to title page]]
Newton had been urged to make a new edition of the ''Principia'' since the early 1690s, partly because copies of the first edition had already become very rare and expensive within a few years after 1687.&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.4, Cambridge University Press 1967, at pp.519, n.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Newton referred to his plans for a second edition in correspondence with Flamsteed in November 1694:&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.4, Cambridge University press 1967, at p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also maintained annotated copies of the first edition specially bound up with interleaves on which he could note his revisions; two of these copies still survive:&lt;ref&gt;I Bernard Cohen, Introduction to the Principia, Cambridge 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had not completed the revisions by 1708, and of two would-be editors, Newton had almost severed connections with one, [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]], and the other, [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] seems not to have met with Newton's approval and was also terminally ill, dying later in 1708. Nevertheless, reasons were accumulating not to put off the new edition any longer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard S. Westfall]]. ''Never at Rest'': A Biography of Isaac Newton. Cambridge U. Press. 1980 {{ISBN|0-521-23143-4}}, at p. 699.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Bentley]], master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], persuaded Newton to allow him to undertake a second edition, and in June 1708 Bentley wrote to Newton with a specimen print of the first sheet, at the same time expressing the (unfulfilled) hope that Newton had made progress towards finishing the revisions.&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol. 4, Cambridge University press 1967, at pp. 518–520.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Bentley then realised that the editorship was technically too difficult for him, and with Newton's consent he appointed [[Roger Cotes]], Plumian professor of astronomy at Trinity, to undertake the editorship for him as a kind of deputy (but Bentley still made the publishing arrangements and had the financial responsibility and profit). The correspondence of 1709–1713 shows Cotes reporting to two masters, Bentley and Newton, and managing (and often correcting) a large and important set of revisions to which Newton sometimes could not give his full attention.&lt;ref&gt;''The Correspondence of Isaac Newton'', vol. 5, Cambridge University press 1975. Bentley's letter to Newton of October 1709 (at pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8) describes Cotes' perhaps unenviable position in relation to his master Bentley: &quot;You need not be so shy of giving Mr. Cotes too much trouble: he has more esteem for you, and obligations to you, than to think that trouble too grievous: but however he does it at my Orders, to whom he owes more than that.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Under the weight of Cotes' efforts, but impeded by priority disputes between Newton and Leibniz,&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, pp. 712–716.&lt;/ref&gt; and by troubles at the Mint,&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, pp. 751–760.&lt;/ref&gt; Cotes was able to announce publication to Newton on 30 June 1713.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, p. 750.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley sent Newton only six presentation copies; Cotes was unpaid; Newton omitted any acknowledgement to Cotes.

Among those who gave Newton corrections for the Second Edition were: [[Firmin Abauzit]], Roger Cotes and David Gregory. However, Newton omitted acknowledgements to some because of the priority disputes. [[John Flamsteed]], the Astronomer Royal, suffered this especially.

The Second Edition was the basis of the first edition to be printed abroad, which appeared in Amsterdam in 1714.

===Third edition, 1726===
The third edition was published 25 March 1726, under the stewardship of ''[[Henry Pemberton]], M.D., a man of the greatest skill in these matters...''; Pemberton later said that this recognition was worth more to him than the two hundred guinea award from Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, p. 802.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annotated and other editions===
In 1739–1742, two French priests, Pères Thomas LeSeur and [[François Jacquier]] (of the [[Minim (religious order)|Minim]] order, but sometimes erroneously identified as Jesuits), produced with the assistance of [[Jean-Louis Calandrini|J.-L. Calandrini]] an extensively annotated version of the ''Principia'' in the 3rd edition of 1726. Sometimes this is referred to as the ''Jesuit edition'': it was much used, and reprinted more than once in Scotland during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facsimile&quot;/&gt;

[[Émilie du Châtelet]] also made a translation of Newton's ''Principia'' into French. Unlike LeSeur and Jacquier's edition, hers was a complete translation of Newton's three books and their prefaces. She also included a Commentary section where she fused the three books into a much clearer and easier to understand summary. She included an analytical section where she applied the new mathematics of calculus to Newton's most controversial theories. Previously, geometry was the standard mathematics used to analyse theories. Du Châtelet's translation is the only complete one to have been done in French and hers remains the standard French translation to this day.&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;Translating Newton's 'Principia': The Marquise du Châtelet's Revisions and Additions for a French Audience&quot;. Author: Judith P. Zinsser. Source: ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 55, No. 2 (May 2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;227–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English translations===
Two full English translations of Newton's ''Principia'' have appeared, both based on Newton's 3rd edition of 1726.

The first, from 1729, by Andrew Motte,&lt;ref name=&quot;Motte&quot;/&gt; was described by Newton scholar [[I. Bernard Cohen]] (in 1968) as &quot;still of enormous value in conveying to us the sense of Newton's words in their own time, and it is generally faithful to the original: clear, and well written&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;I Bernard Cohen (1968), &quot;Introduction&quot; (at page i) to (facsimile) reprint of 1729 English translation of Newton's &quot;Principia&quot; (London (1968), Dawsons of Pall Mall).&lt;/ref&gt; The 1729 version was the basis for several republications, often incorporating revisions, among them a widely used modernised English version of 1934, which appeared under the editorial name of [[Florian Cajori]] (though completed and published only some years after his death). Cohen pointed out ways in which the 18th-century terminology and punctuation of the 1729 translation might be confusing to modern readers, but he also made severe criticisms of the 1934 modernised English version, and showed that the revisions had been made without regard to the original, also demonstrating gross errors &quot;that provided the final impetus to our decision to produce a wholly new translation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See pages 29–37 in [[I. Bernard Cohen]] (1999), &quot;A Guide to Newton's Principia&quot;, published as an introduction to ''Isaac Newton: The Principia, Mathematical principles of natural philosophy, a new translation'' by I Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, University of California Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second full English translation, into modern English, is the work that resulted from this decision by collaborating translators I. Bernard Cohen, Anne Whitman, and Julia Budenz; it was published in 1999 with a guide by way of introduction.&lt;ref&gt;''Isaac Newton: The Principia, Mathematical principles of natural philosophy, a new translation'' by I. Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, preceded by &quot;A Guide to Newton's Principia&quot; by I. Bernard Cohen, University of California Press, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-520-08816-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-08817-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dana Densmore and William H. Donahue have published a translation of the work's central argument, published in 1996, along with expansion of included proofs and ample commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Densmore and William H. Donahue, ''Newton's Principia: The Central Argument: Translation, Notes, and Expanded Proofs'' (Green Lion Press; 3rd edition, 2003) {{ISBN|978-1-888009-23-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-888009-23-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was developed as a textbook for classes at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] and the aim of this translation is to be faithful to the Latin text.&lt;ref&gt;Densmore and Donahue, pp. xv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homages===
In 2014, British [[astronaut]] [[Tim Peake]] named his upcoming mission to the [[International Space Station]] ''Principia'' after the book, in &quot;honour of Britain's greatest scientist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28329097|title=Tim Peake mission name pays tribute to Isaac Newton|work=BBC News|date=17 July 2014|last1=Ghosh|first1=Pallab}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Peake's ''Principia'' launched on December 15, 2015 aboard [[Soyuz TMA-19M]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2015/06/09/roscosmos-announces-new-soyuzprogress-launch-dates/?linkId=14819770|title=Roscosmos Announces New Soyuz/Progress Launch Dates|date=9 June 2015|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PVP was used as a [[blood plasma|plasma]] [[volume expander]] for trauma victims after the 1950s. It is not preferred as volume expander due to its ability to provoke histamine release and also interfere with blood grouping. 

It is used as a [[excipient#Binders|binder]] in many pharmaceutical tablets;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bühler |first=Volker |year=2005 |title=Polyvinylpyrrolidone Excipients for Pharmaceuticals: Povidone, Crospovidone and Copovidone |url=https://archive.org/details/polyvinylpyrroli00buhl |url-access=limited |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin, Heidelberg, New York |isbn=978-3540234128| pages=[https://archive.org/details/polyvinylpyrroli00buhl/page/n12 1]–254|doi=10.1007/b138598}}&lt;/ref&gt; it simply passes through the body when taken orally. (However, autopsies have found that [[polyvinylpolypyrrolidone|crospovidone (PVPP)]] contributes to pulmonary vascular injury in substance abusers who have injected pharmaceutical tablets intended for oral consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 12692192| year = 2003| last1 = Ganesan| first1 = S| title = Embolized crospovidone (polyN-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) in the lungs of intravenous drug users| journal = Modern Pathology| volume = 16| issue = 4| pages = 286–92| last2 = Felo| first2 = J| last3 = Saldana| first3 = M| last4 = Kalasinsky| first4 = V.

PVP added to [[iodine]] forms a complex called [[povidone-iodine]] that possesses [[disinfectant]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060313193322/http://www.ispcorp.com/products/pharma/content/brochure/pvpiodine/pvpiodine.pdf PVP-Iodine]. ispcorp.com. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This complex is used in various products like solutions, [[ointment]], [[pessary|pessaries]], liquid soaps and surgical scrubs. It is known under the trade names Pyodine and [[povidone-iodine|Betadine]], among a plethora of others.

It is used in [[pleurodesis]] (fusion of the pleura because of incessant pleural effusions). For this purpose, povidone iodine is equally effective and safe as [[talc]], and may be preferred because of easy availability and low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Das SK, Saha SK, Das A, Halder AK, Banerjee SN, Chakraborty M |title=A study of comparison of efficacy and safety of talc and povidone iodine for pleurodesis of malignant pleural effusions |journal=Journal of the Indian Medical Association |volume=106 |issue=9 |pages=589–90, 592 |date= 2008 |pmid=19552086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PVP is used in some [[contact lens]]es and their packaging solutions. It reduces friction, thus acting as a lubricant, or [[surfactant|wetting agent]], built into the lens. Examples of this use include Bausch &amp; Lomb's Ultra contact lenses with MoistureSeal Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.clspectrum.com/issues/2014/may-2014/contact-lens-design-amp;-materials |title=Contact Lens Design &amp; Materials: New Lens Technology Targets Improved Vision and Comfort |website=Contact Lens SPECTRUM |date=May 1, 2014 |access-date=Sep 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Air Optix [[contact lens]] packaging solution (as an ingredient called &quot;copolymer 845&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.clspectrum.com/issues/2009/october-2009/contact-lens-materials |title=Contact Lens Design &amp; Materials: The Evolution of Contact Lens Wetting Agents |website=Contact Lens SPECTRUM |date=October 1, 2009 |access-date=Sep 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PVP is used as a lubricant in some eye drops, e.g. [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]]'s Soothe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bausch.com/our-products/dry-eye-products/dry-eye-products/soothe-hydration-lubricant-eye-drops |title=Soothe Hydration Lubricant Eye Drops |publisher=Bausch &amp; Lomb |access-date=Sep 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
PVP binds to [[polar molecule]]s exceptionally well, owing to its [[chemical polarity|polarity]]. This has led to its application in coatings for photo-quality ink-jet papers and transparencies, as well as in inks for [[inkjet printer]]s.

PVP is also used in personal care products, such as [[shampoo]]s and [[toothpaste]]s, in [[paint]]s, and [[adhesive]]s that must be moistened, such as old-style [[postage stamp]]s and [[envelope]]s. It has also been used in [[contact lens]] solutions and in [[steel]]-quenching solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fischer, Frank  |author2=Bauer, Stephan |name-list-style=amp |title=Ein Polyvinylpyrrolidon (PVP): ein vielseitiges Spezialpolymer – Verwendung in der Keramik und als Metallabschreckmedium |volume=61 |issue=6|pages=382–385 |year=2009 |journal=Keramische Zeitschrift }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alexander |last1=Göthlich |first2=Sebastian |last2=Koltzenburg |first3=Gunnar |last3=Schornick |title=Funktionale Polymere im Alltag: Vielseitig |journal=Chemie in Unserer Zeit |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=262–273 |year=2005 |pmid= |doi=10.1002/ciuz.200400346}}&lt;/ref&gt; PVP is the basis of the early formulas for [[hair spray]]s and [[hair gel]]s, and still continues to be a component of some.

As a [[food additive]], PVP is a [[Stabilizer (food)|stabilizer]] and has [[E number]] '''E1201'''. [[PVPP]] (crospovidone) is '''E1202'''. It is also used in the wine industry as a [[finings (wine)|fining agent]] for [[wine|white wine]] and some [[beer]]s.

In [[molecular biology]], PVP can be used as a blocking agent during [[Southern blot]] analysis as a component of [[Denhardt's buffer]]. It is also exceptionally good at absorbing polyphenols during DNA purification. [[Polyphenols]] are common in many plant tissues and can deactivate proteins if not removed and therefore inhibit many downstream reactions like PCR.

In [[microscopy]], PVP is useful for making an aqueous mounting medium.&lt;ref&gt;Lillie RD &amp; Fullmer HM (1976) ''Histopathologic Technic and Practical Histochemistry'', 4th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 411. {{ISBN|0-07-037862-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

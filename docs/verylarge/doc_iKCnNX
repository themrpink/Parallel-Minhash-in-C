Being primarily an island, Manhattan is linked to New York City's outer boroughs by numerous bridges, of various sizes. Manhattan has fixed [[highway]] connections with [[New Jersey]] to its west by way of the [[George Washington Bridge]], the [[Holland Tunnel]], and the [[Lincoln Tunnel]], and to three of the four other New York City boroughs—[[the Bronx]] to the northeast, and [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]] (both on [[Long Island]]) to the east and south. Its only direct connection with the fifth New York City borough, [[Staten Island]], is the [[Staten Island Ferry]] across [[New York Harbor]], which is free of charge. The ferry terminal is located near [[Battery Park (New York)|Battery Park]] at Manhattan's southern tip. It is also possible to travel on land to Staten Island by way of Brooklyn, via the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge]].

There are numerous bridges to the Bronx across the [[Harlem River]], and five (listed north to south)—the [[Triborough Bridge|Triborough]] (known officially as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), [[Queensboro Bridge|Ed Koch Queensboro]] (also known as the 59th Street Bridge), [[Williamsburg Bridge|Williamsburg]], [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]], and [[Brooklyn Bridge]]s—that cross the [[East River]] to connect Manhattan to Long Island.

Several tunnels also link Manhattan Island to New York City's outer boroughs and New Jersey. The [[Lincoln Tunnel]], which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and [[Midtown Manhattan]], is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/lincoln/|title=Lincoln Tunnel Historic Overview|publisher=Eastern Roads|access-date=August 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609143937/http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/lincoln/|archive-date=June 9, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and [[cargo ship]]s that sail through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers.

===Utilities===
Gas and electric service is provided by [[Consolidated Edison]] to all of Manhattan. Con Edison's electric business traces its roots back to [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Edison Illuminating Company|Edison Electric Illuminating Company]], the first investor-owned electric utility. The company started service on September 4, 1882, using one generator to provide 110&amp;nbsp;[[volt]]s [[direct current]] (DC) to 59 customers with 800 light bulbs, in a one-square-mile area of Lower Manhattan from his [[Pearl Street Station]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearlstreetinc.com/NYISO_bulk_elect_beginnings.pdf &quot;Bulk Electricity Grid Beginnings&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226080753/http://www.pearlstreetinc.com/NYISO_bulk_elect_beginnings.pdf |date=February 26, 2009 }}, [[New York Independent System Operator]].

Margulis was also the co-developer of the [[Gaia hypothesis]] with the British chemist [[James Lovelock]], proposing that the Earth functions as a single self-regulating system, and was the principal defender and promulgator of the [[Five kingdoms|five kingdom classification]] of [[Robert Whittaker (ecologist)|Robert Whittaker]].

Throughout her career, Margulis' work could arouse intense objection (one grant application elicited the response, &quot;Your research is crap, do not bother to apply again&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chelsea Green&quot;/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2020}}), and her formative paper, &quot;On the Origin of Mitosing Cells&quot;, appeared in 1967 after being rejected by about fifteen journals.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrockmanInterview&quot;/&gt; Still a junior faculty member at Boston University at the time, her theory that [[cell organelles]] such as [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s were once independent [[bacteria]] was largely ignored for another decade, becoming widely accepted only after it was powerfully substantiated through genetic evidence. Margulis was elected a member of the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1983. President [[Bill Clinton]] presented her the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1999. The [[Linnean Society of London]] awarded her the [[Darwin-Wallace Medal]] in 2008.

Many of her major works, particularly those intended for a general readership, were collaboratively written with her son [[Dorion Sagan]].

== Personal life ==
Margulis married astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] in 1957 soon after she got her bachelor's degree. Sagan was then a graduate student in physics at the University of Chicago. Their marriage ended in 1964, just before she completed her PhD. They had two sons, [[Dorion Sagan]], who later became a popular science writer and her collaborator, and Jeremy Sagan, software developer and founder of Sagan Technology. In 1967, she married Thomas N. Margulis, a [[crystallography|crystallographer]]. They had a son named Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, a New York City criminal defense lawyer, and a daughter Jennifer Margulis, teacher and author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lynn Margulis |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/228/000268421/ |website=[[NNDB.com]] |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weil&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weil |first1=Martin |title=Lynn Margulis, leading evolutionary biologist, dies at 73 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/lynn-margulis-leading-evolutionary-biologist-dies-at-73/2011/11/26/gIQAQ5dezN_story.html |access-date=19 December 2014 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1980. She commented, &quot;I quit my job as a wife twice,&quot; and, &quot;it’s not humanly possible to be a good wife, a good mother, and a first-class scientist. No one can do it — something has to go.&quot;&lt;ref name=weil/&gt; In the 2000s she had a relationship with fellow biologist Ricardo Guerrero.&lt;ref name=nndb/&gt; Her sister Joan Alexander married Nobel Laureate [[Sheldon Lee Glashow]]; another sister, Sharon, married mathematician [[Daniel Kleitman]].

She was a religious [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],&lt;ref name=nndb/&gt; and a staunch [[evolutionist]]. But she rejected the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]],&lt;ref name=MargulisDiscover/&gt; and said: &quot;I remember waking up one day with an epiphanous revelation: I am not a neo-Darwinist! I recalled an earlier experience, when I realized that I wasn't a humanistic Jew. Although I greatly admire Darwin's contributions and agree with most of his theoretical analysis and I am a Darwinist, I am not a neo-Darwinist.&quot;&lt;ref name=BrockmanInterview/&gt; She argued that &quot;Natural selection eliminates and maybe maintains, but it doesn't create&quot;, and maintained that symbiosis was the major driver of evolutionary change.&lt;ref name=MargulisDiscover/&gt;

In 2013, Margulis was listed as having been a member of the Advisory Council of the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ncse.com/about/advisory-council |title=Advisory Council |website=ncse.com |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810112828/https://ncse.com/about/advisory-council |archivedate=2013-08-10 |accessdate=2018-10-30 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, as a young faculty member at [[Boston University]], Margulis wrote a theoretical paper titled &quot;On the Origin of Mitosing Cells&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=Lynn |title=On the origin of mitosing cells |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |year=1967 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=225–274 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3 |pmid=11541392}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper, however, was &quot;rejected by about fifteen scientific journals,&quot; she recalled.&lt;ref name=BrockmanInterview&gt;Margulis, Lynn, [http://www.edge.org/documents/ThirdCulture/n-Ch.7.html Gaia Is a Tough Bitch]. Chapter&amp;nbsp;7 in The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution by John Brockman (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally accepted by ''[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]]'' and is considered today a landmark in modern [[endosymbiotic theory]]. Weathering constant criticism of her ideas for decades, Margulis was famous for her tenacity in pushing her theory forward, despite the opposition she faced at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; The descent of mitochondria from bacteria and of chloroplasts from cyanobacteria was experimentally demonstrated in 1978 by [[Murder of Robert Schwartz#Background|Robert Schwartz]] and [[Margaret Dayhoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=R. |last2=Dayhoff |first2=M. |title=Origins of prokaryotes, eukaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts |journal=Science |year=1978 |volume=199 |issue=4327 |pages=395–403 |doi=10.1126/science.202030 |pmid=202030 |bibcode=1978Sci...199..395S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formed the first experimental evidence for the symbiogenesis theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; The endosymbiosis theory of organogenesis became widely accepted in the early 1980s, after the genetic material of [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s had been found to be significantly different from that of the symbiont's [[nuclear DNA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillham2014&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Nicholas W. |last=Gillham |title=Chloroplasts and Mitochondria |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Genetics |editor-first=Eric C.R. |editor-last=Reeve |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PuCYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA721 |date=14 January 2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-26350-9 |pages=721–735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, English evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] had this to say about Lynn Margulis and her work:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I greatly admire Lynn Margulis's sheer courage and stamina in sticking by the endosymbiosis theory, and carrying it through from being an unorthodoxy to an orthodoxy. I'm referring to the theory that the eukaryotic cell is a symbiotic union of primitive prokaryotic cells. This is one of the great achievements of twentieth-century evolutionary biology, and I greatly admire her for it.&lt;ref name=BrockmanInterview/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Symbiosis as evolutionary force===
{{main|Symbiosis}}

Margulis opposed competition-oriented views of evolution, stressing the importance of symbiotic or cooperative relationships between species.&lt;ref name=mann/&gt;

She later formulated a theory that proposed symbiotic relationships between organisms of different phyla or kingdoms as the driving force of [[evolution]], and explained [[genetic variation]] as occurring mainly through transfer of nuclear information between [[bacteria|bacterial cells]] or [[virus]]es and [[eukaryotic cell]]s.&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; Her organelle genesis ideas are now widely accepted, but the proposal that symbiotic relationships explain most genetic variation is still something of a fringe idea.&lt;ref name=mann/&gt;

Margulis also held a negative view of certain interpretations of [[Neo-Darwinism]] that she felt were excessively focused on competition between organisms, as she believed that history will ultimately judge them as comprising &quot;a minor twentieth-century religious sect within the sprawling religious persuasion of Anglo-Saxon Biology.&quot;&lt;ref name=mann/&gt;
She wrote that proponents of the standard theory &quot;wallow in their zoological, capitalistic, competitive, cost-benefit interpretation of Darwin – having mistaken him ... Neo-Darwinism, which insists on [the slow accrual of mutations by gene-level natural selection], is in a complete funk.&quot;&lt;ref name=mann/&gt;

===Gaia hypothesis===
{{further|Gaia hypothesis}}
Margulis initially sought out the advice of Lovelock for her own research: she explained that, &quot;In the early seventies, I was trying to align bacteria by their metabolic pathways. I noticed that all kinds of bacteria produced gases. Oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia—more than thirty different gases are given off by the bacteria whose evolutionary history I was keen to reconstruct. Why did every scientist I asked believe that atmospheric oxygen was a biological product but the other atmospheric gases—nitrogen, methane, sulfur, and so on—were not? 'Go talk to Lovelock,' at least four different scientists suggested. Lovelock believed that the gases in the atmosphere were biological.&quot;&lt;ref name=BrockmanInterview/&gt;

Margulis met with Lovelock, who explained his Gaia hypothesis to her, and very soon they began an intense collaborative effort on the concept.&lt;ref name=BrockmanInterview/&gt; One of the earliest significant publications on Gaia was a 1974 paper co-authored by Lovelock and Margulis, which succinctly defined the hypothesis as follows: &quot;The notion of the biosphere as an active adaptive control system able to maintain the Earth in homeostasis we are calling the 'Gaia hypothesis.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lovelock, J.E. |author2=Margulis, L. |title=Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere: the Gaia hypothesis|journal=Tellus|date=1974|volume=26|issue=1–2|pages=2–10|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1974.tb01946.x|bibcode=1974TellA..26....2L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other early presentations of Lovelock's idea, the Lovelock-Margulis 1974 paper seemed to give living organisms complete agency in creating planetary self-regulation, whereas later, as the idea matured, this planetary-scale self-regulation was recognized as an emergent property of the [[Earth system science|Earth system]], life and its physical environment taken together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovelock|first1=James|title=The Ages of Gaia: A Biography of Our Living Earth|date=1988|publisher=W.W.Norton &amp; Co|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; When climatologist Stephen Schneider convened the 1989 American Geophysical Union Chapman Conference around the issue of Gaia, the idea of &quot;strong Gaia&quot; and &quot;weak Gaia&quot; was introduced by James Kirchner, after which Margulis was sometimes associated with the idea of &quot;weak Gaia&quot;, incorrectly (her essay &quot;''Gaia is a Tough Bitch''&quot; dates from 1995 – and it stated her own distinction from Lovelock as she saw it, which was primarily that she did not like the metaphor of Earth as a single organism, because, she said, &quot;No organism eats its own waste&quot;&lt;ref name=BrockmanInterview/&gt;). In her 1998 book ''Symbiotic Planet'', Margulis explored the relationship between Gaia and her work on symbiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Margulis |first1=Lynn |title=Symbiotic Planet |date=1998 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five kingdoms of life===
Since 1969, life on earth was classified into [[five kingdoms]], as introduced by [[Robert Whittaker (ecologist)|Robert Whittaker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whittaker1969&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Whittaker |first=R.H. |date=January 1969 |title=New concepts of kingdoms or organisms.

She rejected the [[three-domain system]] introduced by [[Carl Woese]] in 1990, which gained wide acceptance. She introduced a modified classification by which all life forms, including the newly discovered, could be integrated into the classical five kingdoms. According to her the main problem, archaea, falls under the kingdom Prokaryotae alongside bacteria (in contrast to the three-domain system, which treats archaea as a higher taxon than kingdom, or the six-kingdom system, which holds that it is a separate kingdom).&lt;ref name=hagen/&gt; Her concept is given in detail in her book ''Five Kingdoms'', written with Karlene V. Schwartz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tao|first1=Amy|title=Lynn Margulis|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/364780/Lynn-Margulis|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=18 December 2014|date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that it is mainly because of Margulis that the five-kingdom system survives.&lt;ref name=yount/&gt;

==Controversies==
It has been suggested that initial rejection of Margulis’ work on the endosymbiotic theory, and the controversial nature of it as well as Gaia theory, made her identify throughout her career with scientific mavericks, outsiders and unaccepted theories generally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chelsea Green&quot;/&gt; In the last decade of her life, while key components of her life's work began to be understood as fundamental to a modern scientific viewpoint – the widespread adoption of Earth System Science and the incorporation of key parts of endosymbiotic theory into biology curricula worldwide – Margulis if anything became more embroiled in controversy, not less. Journalist John Wilson explained this by saying that Lynn Margulis “defined herself by oppositional science,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|last1=Wilson|first1=John|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0184w5r|title=Christopher Hitchens, Lynn Margulis, George Whitman and Jerry Robinson|series=The Last Word with John Wilson|accessdate=25 July 2015|network=BBC Radio 4|date=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the commemorative collection of essays ''Lynn Margulis: The Life and Legacy of a Scientific Rebel'', commentators again and again depict her as a modern embodiment of the &quot;scientific rebel&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chelsea Green&quot;/&gt; akin to [[Freeman Dyson]]'s 1995 essay, ''The Scientist as Rebel'', a tradition Dyson saw embodied in [[Benjamin Franklin]], and which he believed to be essential to good science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyson|first1=Freeman|title=The Scientist as Rebel|date=2006|publisher=New York Review of Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59017-216-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, Margulis could make highly provocative comments in interviews that appeared to support her most strident critics’ condemnation. The following describes three of these controversies.

=== Metamorphosis theory ===
In 2009, via a then-standard publication-process known as &quot;communicated submission&quot; (which bypassed traditional peer review), she was instrumental in getting the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (''PNAS'') to publish a paper by [[Donald I. Williamson]] rejecting &quot;the Darwinian assumption that larvae and their adults evolved from a single common ancestor.&quot;&lt;ref name=pnas&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=D. I.|title=Caterpillars evolved from onychophorans by hybridogenesis|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2009|volume=106|issue=47|pages=19901–19905|doi=10.1073/pnas.0908357106|pmid=19717430|pmc=2785264|bibcode=2009PNAS..10619901W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SciAm&quot;&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2009/10/29/controversial-caterpillar-evolution-study-formally-rebutted/ Controversial caterpillar-evolution study formally rebutted], ''[[Scientific American]] Online''&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson's paper provoked immediate response from the [[scientific community]], including a countering paper in ''PNAS''.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt; Conrad Labandeira of the [[Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] said, &quot;If I was reviewing [Williamson's paper] I would probably opt to reject it,&quot; he says, &quot;but I'm not saying it's a bad thing that this is published. What it may do is broaden the discussion on how metamorphosis works and ... [on] ... the origin of these very radical life cycles.&quot; But [[Duke University]] insect developmental biologist [[Fred Nijhout]] said that the paper was better suited for the &quot;''National Enquirer'' than the National Academy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Borrell |first=Brendan |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=national-academy-as-national-enquirer |title=National Academy as National Enquirer ?

''PNAS'' stated that the decision had nothing to do with the Williamson controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;SciAm&quot; /&gt;

=== AIDS/HIV theory ===
In 2009 Margulis and seven others authored a position paper concerning research on the viability of round body forms of some spirochetes, &quot;Syphilis, Lyme disease, &amp; AIDS: Resurgence of 'the great imitator'?&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;biogema&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www1.biogema.de/WEK/312-Margulis-final.pdf |title=Syphilis, Lyme disease &amp; AIDS: Resurgence of &quot;the great imitator&quot;? |journal=Symbiosis |volume=47 |issue=1 |year=2009 |pages=51–58|doi=10.1007/BF03179970 |last1=Margulis |first1=Lynn |last2=Maniotis |first2=Andrew |last3=MacAllister |first3=James |last4=Scythes |first4=John |last5=Brorson |first5=Oystein |last6=Hall |first6=John |last7=Krumbein |first7=Wolfgang E. |last8=Chapman |first8=Michael J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that, &quot;Detailed research that correlates life histories of symbiotic [[spirochete]]s to changes in the immune system of associated vertebrates is sorely needed,&quot; and urging the &quot;reinvestigation of the natural history of mammalian, [[tick]]-borne, and venereal transmission of spirochetes in relation to impairment of the human immune system.&quot; The paper went on to suggest &quot;that the possible direct causal involvement of spirochetes and their round bodies to symptoms of immune deficiency be carefully and vigorously investigated&quot;.&lt;ref name=biogema/&gt;

In a ''[[Discover Magazine]]'' interview which was published less than six months before her death,  Margulis explained to writer Dick Teresi her reason for interest in the topic of 2009 &quot;AIDS&quot; paper: &quot;I'm interested in spirochetes only because of our ancestry. I'm not interested in the diseases,&quot; and stated that she had called them &quot;symbionts&quot; because both the spirochete which causes syphilis (''[[Treponema]]'') and the spirochete which causes Lyme disease (''[[Borrelia]]'') only retain about 20% of the genes they would need to live freely, outside of their human hosts.&lt;ref name=MargulisDiscover/&gt;

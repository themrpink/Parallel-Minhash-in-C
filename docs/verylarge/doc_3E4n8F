2. A ban on the export of [[calipee]] (a part of the turtle's head that is considered a delicacy) in 1970 and finally,

3. The creation of the Tortuguero National Park in 1975 by the legislative assembly.

The lasting impact created by such forward thinking political decisions exhibits the necessity of meaningful governmental intervention.

===== Carbon neutral goal =====
[[File:EARTH-La Flor Campus Classroom.jpg|thumb|Classroom of [[EARTH University|Earth University]] in Costa Rica - a [[carbon neutrality|carbon neutral]] university]]
Although they contribute only 0.15% to the world's [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], the governments of New Zealand and Costa Rica&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5439|title=Costa Rica and New Zealand on Path to Carbon Neutrality {{!}} Worldwatch Institute|website=worldwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; have independently expressed their intents to become carbon neutral in the next decade, with Costa Rica aiming to achieve an ambitious target of becoming carbon neutral by 2021.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-promotes-carbon-neutral-program-2021/|title=Costa Rica Promotes the Carbon Neutral Program in 2021 {{!}} The Costa Rica News|last=Villegas|first=Charito|date=2017-11-14|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, it would become the world's first carbon neutral country, with the expectation of influencing policy decisions in other major countries. The proposal hopes to ignite the interest of private companies to engage in practices that reduce their emissions, for example, using more fuel efficient routes in transportation, relying more on digital documents than printed ones, adopting LED lighting in offices and using more efficient air conditioning systems.

==== Criticisms of active efforts ====
The government's approach to attain zero net emissions has yielded positive results overall, but has been described as insufficient and lacking by experts &lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; because it neglects vehicular emissions which account for nearly 20% of the country's total emissions. The 2021 target has also been called &quot;arbitrary&quot; and &quot;overambitious&quot;, since the efforts to reduce the country's reliance on imported oil &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-carbon-neutral-2021-reality-or-unrealistic/|title=Costa Rica Carbon Neutral 2021: Reality or Unrealistic?|last=STAFF|first=TCRN|date=2014-07-21|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; will take much longer to take effect.

In 2006, a study by Sierra and Russman&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-08-05|title=On the efficiency of environmental service payments: A forest conservation assessment in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica|journal=Ecological Economics|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=131–141|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.10.010|issn=0921-8009|last1=Sierra|first1=Rodrigo|last2=Russman|first2=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the additional conservation obtained through PES, over and above the baseline conservation rate. The study concluded that the PES program definitely affected land use decisions because land owners used the payments for other productive activities thus keeping the forest cover intact. However, they also concluded that this was not the most effective use of funds because the majority of these forests would have remained intact even without the payments. The study suggested that it would a better strategy to engage in the protection of more critical habitats instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

Protestors of this project claim that the construction has failed to meet the expectations on the following issues:&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

1) The constructors did not completely clear vegetation from the areas that would be flooded due to this project. As a result, the uncleared vegetation in the flooded areas began to stagnate, creating the perfect conditions for the growth of the [[Eichhornia crassipes|Water Hyacinth]] (an invasive species). The Water Hyacinth acted as a source for a large amount of carbon dioxide and methane emitted into the atmosphere.

2) Reforestation around the reservoir lake to assist in the migration of the jaguars has not been completed making their movement more difficult.

3) Due to the removal of a lot of material to facilitate construction, the neighboring Lancaster wetlands (home to more than 250 species of birds and 80 species of mammals, reptiles and amphibians) have been left in a state more susceptible to landslides.

What appears to be common in these criticisms is that the initiatives have moved things in the right direction overall, but the implementation hasn't been as good as promised.

==Evidence-based conservation==
{{Main|Evidence-based conservation}}

Evidence-based conservation is the application of evidence in conservation management actions and policy making. It is defined as systematically assessing scientific information from published, [[peer-review]]ed publications and texts, practitioners' experiences, independent expert assessment, and local and [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] knowledge on a specific conservation topic.  This includes assessing the current effectiveness of different management interventions, threats and emerging problems and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web 
| title = The Basics |publisher=Conservation Evidence
| url = http://www.conservationevidence.com/faq/index 
| accessdate = 2015-03-07 
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence-based [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] was organized based on the observations that decision making in conservation was based on [[:wikt:intuition|intuition]] and/ or practitioner experience often disregarding other forms of evidence of successes and failures (e.g. scientific information). This has led to costly and poor outcomes.&lt;ref name=Sutherland&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sutherland|first1=William J|last2=Pullin|first2=Andrew S.|last3=Dolman|first3=Paul M.|last4=Knigh|first4=Teri M.|title=The need for evidence-based conservation|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=June 2004|volume=19|issue=6|pages=305–308|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.03.018|pmid=16701275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence-based conservation provides access to information that will support decision making through an evidence-based framework of “what works” in conservation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sutherland|first1=William J.|title= Evidence-based Conservation|journal= Conservation in Practice|date=July 2003|volume=4|issue=3|pages=39–42|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4629.2003.tb00068.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence-based approach to conservation is based on evidence-based practice which started in [[Evidence-based medicine|medicine]] and later spread to [[Evidence Based Nursing|nursing]], [[Evidence based education|education]], [[psychology]] and other fields. It is part of the larger movement towards [[evidence-based practices]].

== Areas of concern ==
[[File:Suojelutaulu.JPG|thumb|A conservation area's sign in the [[Finland|Finnish]] forest. It says, &quot;A conservation area protected by law&quot;.]]
[[Deforestation]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] are issues affecting all regions of the world.  The consequent destruction of wildlife habitat has prompted the creation of conservation groups in other countries, some founded by local hunters who have witnessed declining wildlife populations first hand.  Also, it was highly important for the conservation movement to solve problems of living conditions in the cities and the overpopulation of such places.

=== Boreal forest and the Arctic ===
The idea of incentive conservation is a modern one but its practice has clearly defended some of the sub Arctic wildernesses and the wildlife in those regions for thousands of years, especially by indigenous peoples such as the Evenk, Yakut, Sami, Inuit and Cree. The fur trade and hunting by these peoples have preserved these regions for thousands of years. Ironically, the pressure now upon them comes from non-renewable resources such as oil, sometimes to make synthetic clothing which is advocated as a humane substitute for fur. (See [[Raccoon dog]] for case study of the conservation of an animal through fur trade.) Similarly, in the case of the beaver, hunting and fur trade were thought to bring about the animal's demise, when in fact they were an integral part of its conservation. For many years children's books stated and still do, that the decline in the beaver population was due to the fur trade. In reality however, the decline in beaver numbers was because of habitat destruction and deforestation, as well as its continued persecution as a pest (it causes flooding). In Cree lands however, where the population valued the animal for meat and fur, it continued to thrive. The Inuit defend their relationship with the seal in response to outside critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc.gl/UserFiles/File/sealskin/2006-03-07_icc_saelskind_pressemeddelse_eng.pdf|title=Inuit Ask Europeans to Support Its Seal Hunt and Way of Life|date=6 March 2006|accessdate=12 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628204105/http://www.icc.gl/UserFiles/File/sealskin/2006-03-07_icc_saelskind_pressemeddelse_eng.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America (Bolivia) ===
The [[Izoceño people|Izoceño]]-[[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]], [[Bolivia]] is a tribe of hunters who were influential in establishing the Capitania del Alto y Bajo Isoso (CABI). CABI promotes economic growth and survival of the Izoceno people while discouraging the rapid destruction of habitat within Bolivia's [[Gran Chaco]]. They are responsible for the creation of the 34,000 square kilometre Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Area (KINP).  The KINP protects the most biodiverse portion of the Gran Chaco, an ecoregion shared with Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. In 1996, the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] joined forces with CABI to institute wildlife and hunting monitoring programs in 23 Izoceño communities. The partnership combines traditional beliefs and local knowledge with the political and administrative tools needed to effectively manage habitats. The programs rely solely on voluntary participation by local hunters who perform self-monitoring techniques and keep records of their hunts.  The information obtained by the hunters participating in the program has provided CABI with important data required to make educated decisions about the use of the land. Hunters have been willing participants in this program because of pride in their traditional activities, encouragement by their communities and expectations of benefits to the area.

=== Africa (Botswana) ===
In order to discourage illegal South African hunting parties and ensure future local use and sustainability, indigenous hunters in [[Botswana]] began lobbying for and implementing conservation practices in the 1960s. The Fauna Preservation Society of Ngamiland (FPS) was formed in 1962 by the husband and wife team: Robert Kay and June Kay, environmentalists working in conjunction with the Batawana tribes to preserve wildlife habitat.

The FPS promotes habitat conservation and provides local education for preservation of wildlife. Conservation initiatives were met with strong opposition from the Botswana government because of the monies tied to big-game hunting. In 1963, BaTawanga Chiefs and tribal hunter/adventurers in conjunction with the FPS founded [[Moremi Wildlife Reserve|Moremi National Park and Wildlife Refuge]], the first area to be set aside by tribal people rather than governmental forces. Moremi National Park is home to a variety of wildlife, including lions, giraffes, elephants, buffalo, zebra, cheetahs and antelope, and covers an area of 3,000 square kilometers.  Most of the groups involved with establishing this protected land were involved with hunting and were motivated by their personal observations of declining wildlife and habitat.

Autarky as an ideal or method has been embraced by a wide range of [[political ideologies]] and  movements, especially left-wing creeds like [[African socialism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], [[war communism]],&lt;ref&gt;

Autarky may be a policy of a state or other entity when it seeks to be self-sufficient as a whole, but also can be limited to a narrow field such as possession of a key raw material. 

Some countries have a policy of autarky with respect to foodstuffs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research1/BerlinSumner.pdf | title= Archived copy | accessdate= 2014-01-18 | url-status= live | archiveurl= http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140120232431/http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research1/BerlinSumner.pdf | archivedate= 2014-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and water for [[national security | national-security]] reasons.

Autarky can result from economic isolation or from external circumstances in which a state or other entity reverts to localized production when it lacks currency or excess production to trade with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;

A military autarky would be a state that could defend itself without help from another country, or could manufacture all of its weapons.

== Etymology ==

The word ''autarky'' is from the {{lang-el|αὐτάρκεια}}, which means &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; (derived from αὐτο-, &quot;self&quot;, and ἀρκέω, &quot;to suffice&quot;). The term is sometimes confused with [[autocracy]] (Greek: αὐτoκρατία &quot;government by single absolute ruler&quot;) or [[Autarchism|autarchy]] (Greek: αὐταρχία – the idea of rejecting government and ruling oneself and no other).

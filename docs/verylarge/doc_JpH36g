==Criticism of the term==
According to [[Free Software Foundation]] compliance engineer David Turner, the term ''viral license'' creates a misunderstanding and a fear of using copylefted free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/2006082902126OSHLLL |title=IT Manager's Journal: 10 Common Misunderstandings About the GPL |first=Bruce |last=Byfield |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; David McGowan has written that there is no reason to believe the GPL could force proprietary software to become free software, but could &quot;try to enjoin the firm from distributing commercially a program that combined with the GPL'd code to form a derivative work, and to recover damages for [[copyright infringement|infringement]].&quot;  If the firm &quot;actually copied code from a GPL'd program, such a suit would be a perfectly ordinary assertion of copyright, which most private firms would defend if the shoe were on the other foot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

Richard Stallman has described this view with an analogy, saying, &quot;The GPL's domain does not spread by proximity or contact, only by deliberate inclusion of GPL-covered code in your program. It spreads like a [[Chlorophytum comosum|spider plant]], not like a virus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Interoperability==
Popular copyleft licenses, such as the GPL, have a clause allowing components to interact with non-copyleft components as long as the communication is abstract{{Failed verification|date=May 2020|reason=source does not use word abstract once and it also does not lay out clear guidelines, just gives some rather vague examples}}, such as executing a [[command-line]] tool with a set of switches or interacting with a [[Web server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation |title=Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=24 June 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, even if one module of an otherwise non-copyleft product is placed under the GPL, it may still be legal for other components to communicate with it normally{{clarify |date=May 2020 |reason=it may also not be legal, this is written to favour one point of view}}. This allowed communication may or may not include reusing libraries or routines via [[dynamic linking]] — some commentators say it does,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/Licensing-HOWTO.html#id2789302 |title=Licensing HOWTO |date=9 November 2002 |first=Eric Steven |last=Raymond |authorlink=Eric S. Raymond |accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] asserts it does not and explicitly adds an [[GPL linking exception|exception allowing it]] in the license for the [[GNU Classpath]] re-implementation of the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] library.

The interoperability clauses are often pragmatically inoperative due to the vigorous enforcement and strict interpretation of the GPL as it related to integration, aggregation, and linking. It is argued that most forms of incorporation, aggregation, or connectivity with GPL-licensed code is a derivative work that must be licensed under the GPL. In recent years, a number of communities using GPL-incompatible licenses have dropped efforts and support for interoperability with GPL-licensed products in response to this trend. Some developers and communities have switched to the GPL or a GPL-compatible license in response, which critics and supporters alike agree is intentional end result. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson''' (born March 28, 1941 as '''Jeffrey Lloyd Masson''') is an American author. Masson is best known for his conclusions about [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. In his ''[[The Assault on Truth]]'' (1984), Masson argues that Freud may have abandoned his [[Freud's seduction theory|seduction theory]] because he feared that granting the truth of his female patients' claims (that they had been [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]]) would hinder the acceptance of his [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] methods. Masson is a [[veganism]] advocate and has written about [[animal rights]].&lt;ref name=Jeff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffreymasson.com/about.html |title=About Jeff |publisher=Jeffreymasson.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Jeffrey Masson is the son of Jacques Masson, a Frenchman of [[Bukharian Jew|Bukharian]] ancestry, and Diana (Dina) Zeiger from an [[Ashkenazi]] strict [[Orthodox Jew]]ish family. Both of his parents were followers of the [[guru]] [[Paul Brunton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NY&quot;/&gt; Masson's mother later became a follower of [[Mysticism|mystic]] [[John Levy (philosopher)|John Levy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ods.nl/am1gos/am1gos5/index.html?jl_vriend_us.html~mainFrame |title=John Levy: friend and contrary guru |publisher=Ods.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 1950s, Brunton often lived with them, eventually designating Masson as his [[heir apparent]]. In 1956, Diana and Jacques Masson moved to [[Uruguay]] because Brunton believed that a [[World War III|third world war]] was imminent. Jeffrey and his sister Linda followed in 1959.

At Brunton's urging, Masson went to [[Harvard University]] to study [[Sanskrit]]. While at Harvard, Masson became disillusioned with Brunton. Brunton and his influence on the Masson family form the subject of Masson's autobiographical book ''My Father's Guru: A Journey Through Spirituality and Disillusion''. [[Harvard University]] granted Masson a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1964 and a [[Ph.D.]] with Honors in 1970. His degrees were in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Indian Studies]]. While undertaking his Ph.D., Masson also studied, supported by fellowships, at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris, the [[University of Calcutta]], and the [[University of Poona]].

Masson taught Sanskrit and Indian Studies at the [[University of Toronto]], 1969–80, reaching the rank of Professor. He has also held short term appointments at [[Brown University]], the [[University of California]], and the [[University of Michigan]]. From 1981 to 1992, he was a Research Associate, Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He is currently an Honorary Fellow in the Department of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Auckland]] in New Zealand.

== Views on Freud's seduction theory ==
In 1970, Masson began studying to become a psychoanalyst at the Toronto Psychoanalytic Institute, completing a full clinical training course in 1978. His training analyst was Irvine Schiffer, a well-known Toronto analyst and author of books on the unconscious aspects of charisma and time. In 1990 Masson published an autobiographical book in which he accused Schiffer of cursing, being constantly late for sessions, and intimidating Masson when the latter complained about this issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Analysis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Masson |first=Jeffrey |year=1990 |title=Final Analysis: The Making and Unmaking of a Psychoanalyst |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-52368-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiffer denied it and debated Masson on the Canadian television program ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=61MAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 | title=Love is Strange | publisher=([[Google Books]]) | work=[[New York Magazine]] | date=March 22, 1993 | accessdate=November 14, 2012 | author=Smith, Dinitia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Masson befriended the psychoanalyst [[Kurt Eissler]] and became acquainted with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s daughter [[Anna Freud]]. Eissler designated Masson to succeed him as Director of the [[Sigmund Freud Archives]] after his and Anna Freud's death. Masson learned [[German language|German]] and studied the [[history of psychoanalysis]]. In 1980 Masson was appointed Projects Director of the Freud Archives, with full access to Freud's correspondence and other unpublished papers. While perusing this material, Masson concluded that Freud might have rejected the seduction theory in order to advance the cause of [[psychoanalysis]] and to maintain his own place within the psychoanalytic inner circle, after a hostile response from the renowned sex-pathologist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] and the rest of the Vienna Psychiatric Society in 1896 - &quot;an icy reception from the jackasses,&quot; was the way Freud described it later to Fliess
&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9A0CEFDA123BF936A1575BC0A967948260 &quot;Did Freud's Isolation Lead Him to Reverse Theory on Neurosis?&quot;] by Ralph Blumenthal, ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 25, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Masson's controversial conclusions were discussed in a series of ''New York Times'' articles by Ralph Blumenthal, to the dismay of the psychoanalytic establishment. Masson was subsequently dismissed from his position as project director of the Freud Archives and stripped of his membership in psychoanalytic professional societies. Masson was defended by [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]]&lt;ref&gt;PSYCHOLOGIE HEUTE, April 1987, P.21, 22: &quot;Im Gegensatz zu manchen Interpreten, die, wie zum Beispiel Marianne Krüll, Marie Balmary oder Jeffrey Masson, Freuds Abkehr von der Wahrheit als Folge seiner Familiengeschichte deuten, sehe ich diesen Schritt als Folge und Ausdruck unserer jahrtausendealten kinderfeindlichen Tradition, in der wir auch heute noch leben. Die Ergebnisse der oben genannten historischen Forscher können trotzdem korrekt sein, aber ich meine, daß es Freud trotz der persönlichen Familiengeschichte möglich gewesen wäre, seiner Entdeckung treu zu bleiben, wenn die Gesellschaft als Ganzes nicht so kinderfeindlich gewesen wäre, wenn schon damals andere, freiere Erziehungsmuster denkbar gewesen wären. Doch zur Zeit Freuds war es noch absolut unmöglich, die Unschuld der Eltern in Frage zu stellen.&quot; Alice Miller in interview entitled ''Wie Psychotherapien das Kind verraten''&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Muriel Gardiner]] (&quot;While striving not to take sides,&quot; Gardiner said, &quot;I consider him a good and energetic worker and a worthwhile scholar&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9400E3DA1E39F93AA35752C1A967948260 &quot;Freud Archives Research Chief Removed in Dispute Over Yale Talk&quot;] by Ralph Blumenthal, ''The New York Times'' November 9, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masson later wrote several books critical of psychoanalysis, including ''[[The Assault on Truth|The Assault on Truth: Freud's Suppression of the Seduction Theory]]''. In the introduction to ''The Assault on Truth'', Masson challenged his critics to address his arguments: &quot;My pessimistic conclusions may possibly be wrong. The documents may in fact allow a very different reading.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey |last=Masson |year=1992 |title=The Assault on Truth: Freud's Suppression of the Seduction Theory |publisher=Harper Perennial |location=New York |isbn= 0-06-097457-5 |pages= xxxv |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Malcolm]] interviewed Masson at length when writing her long ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article on this controversy, which she later expanded into ''[[In the Freud Archives]]'', a book that also dealt with Eissler and [[Peter Swales (historian)|Peter Swales]]. Masson sued ''The New Yorker'' for [[defamation]], claiming that Malcolm had misquoted him. The ensuing trial drew considerable attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Psychoanalyst Loses Libel Suit Against a New Yorker Reporter | work = The New York Times | date = 1994-11-03 | author = David Margolick}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decade-long, [[US$]]10 million lawsuit came to a close in 1994 when the court ruled in ''The New Yorker'' 's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/the-journalist-and-the-biographer/2007/10/04/1191091267930.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=SMH article October 6, 2007 |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2007-10-06 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Court of Appeals affirmed ... that Malcolm had deliberately altered each quotation not found on the tape recordings, but nevertheless held that petitioner failed to raise a jury question of actual malice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Masson v.

In 1985, Masson edited and translated Freud's complete correspondence with [[Wilhelm Fliess]] after having convinced Anna Freud to make it available in full. He also looked up the original places and documents in La [[Salpêtrière]] Hospital in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris.org/Kiosque/sep98/la.salpetriere.html History of La Salpêtrière] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103105500/http://www.paris.org/Kiosque/sep98/la.salpetriere.html |date=January 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where Freud had studied with [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]]. Masson writes that the scientific community has been largely silent about his views, and that he suffered personal attacks once he deviated from the traditional views on the seduction theory and the history of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Analysis&quot;/&gt; Both the traditional view and Masson's case against it are built on the account that Freud's seduction theory patients reported having been sexually abused in early childhood; several Freud scholars have disputed this account.&lt;ref&gt;Schimek, J.

== Recent work ==
Since the early 1990s, Masson has written a number of books on the emotional life of animals, one of which, ''When Elephants Weep'', has been translated into 20 languages. He has explained this radical change in the subject of his writings as follows:

{{quote|I'd written a whole series of books about [[psychiatry]], and nobody bought them. Nobody liked them. Nobody. Psychiatrists hated them, and they were much too abstruse for the general public. It was very hard to make a living, and I thought, &quot;As long as I'm not making a living, I may as well write about something I really love: animals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/authors/masson.html |title=Interviews&amp;nbsp;— Jeffrey Masson |publisher=Powells.com |date= |access-date=2012-01-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629103347/http://www.powells.com/authors/masson.html |archive-date=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2008, Masson became a Director of [[Voiceless, the animal protection institute]].  &quot;We are not encouraged, on a daily basis, to pay careful attention to the animals we eat. On the contrary, the meat, dairy, and egg industries all actively encourage us to give thought to our own immediate interest (taste, for example, or cheap food) but not to the real suffering involved ... The animals involved suffer agony because of our ignorance. The least we owe them is to lessen that ignorance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voiceless, the animal protection institute|url=https://www.voiceless.org.au/who-we-are/jeffrey-masson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masson also wrote a book about living in New Zealand, including an interview with Sir [[Edmund Hillary]].&lt;ref&gt;Masson, J., &quot;A Conversation with a Great Ordinary Kiwi: Sir Edmund Hillary,&quot; chpt. 7 in ''Slipping into Paradise''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Masson is married to Leila Masson, a German [[pediatrics|pediatrician]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NY&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leilamasson.com |title=Dr. Leila Masson |publisher=Leilamasson.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two sons. He also has a daughter by a previous marriage with Therese Claire Masson.&lt;ref name=Jeff/&gt; In the early 1990s, Masson had been engaged to [[University of Michigan]] [[feminist]] legal scholar [[Catharine MacKinnon]], who wrote the preface to his ''A Dark Science: Women, Sexuality, and Psychiatry in the Nineteenth Century''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| volume = 26| issue = 12| pages = 36–43| last = Smith| first = Dinitia| title = Love is Strange: The Crusading Feminist and the Repentant Womanizer| work = [[New York Magazine|New York]]| accessdate = 2010-02-14| date = 1993-03-22| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=61MAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=61MAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false cover])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety &quot;Are women human?&quot;] by Stuart Jeffries, ''[[The Guardian]]'', April 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1905 [[World Series]]''' matched the [[National League]] (NL) champion [[1905 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] against the [[American League]] (AL) champion [[1905 Philadelphia Athletics season|Philadelphia Athletics]], with the Giants winning four games to one, now in a best-of-seven format. Four of the five games featured duels between future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitchers.

Games 1 and 3 were played in Philadelphia; games 2, 4, 5 in New York.

Each of the five games was a shutout. Three of those, over a six-day span, were pitched and won by [[Christy Mathewson]].

== Summary ==
Before the Series began, the Athletics were already at a major disadvantage. For the Series, they were without the services of [[Rube Waddell]], who was arguably their best pitcher that year. The reason for Waddell's absence was listed as a shoulder injury from some sort of 'wrestling match' with teammate [[Andy Coakley]], though in years since some have speculated that Waddell was actually bribed or 'paid off' to fake the injury and thus not play in the Series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rube Waddell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sabr.org/research/strangest-month-strange-career-rube-waddell|title=The Strangest Month in the Strange Career of Rube Waddell|accessdate=October 13, 2018|work=Society for American Baseball Research (SABR)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philadelphia manager [[Connie Mack]], however, refused to believe this theory, finding it ridiculous.

== Matchups ==
=== Game 1 ===
Monday, October 9, 1905, at [[Columbia Park]] in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]

The opening game was a [[Glossary of baseball (P)#pitchers' duel|pitchers' duel]] between Christy Mathewson and Eddie Plank. Both got out of jams, shutting the opposing offense down. In the Giants' top of the fifth, Mathewson singled, but was forced by Roger Bresnahan, who stole second shortly afterwards. After George Browne [[Glossary of baseball (P)#pop|popped out]], Mike Donlin singled to left, scoring Bresnahan and advancing Donlin to second. After Dan McGann walked, Sam Mertes doubled, bringing home Donlin. In the Athletics' half of the sixth, Ossee Schreckengost doubled and advanced to third on a wild pitch, but did not score, and was the lone runner to reach third base against Mathewson in the entire series. The Giants added an [[Glossary of baseball (I)#insurance run|insurance run]] in the ninth, when Billy Gilbert scored on Bresnahan's single. This was the first of Mathewson's three [[Glossary of baseball (C)#complete game|complete-game]] [[Glossary of baseball (S)#shutout|shutouts]], a World Series record that may never be matched.

=== Game 2 ===
Tuesday, October 10, 1905, at the [[Polo Grounds|Polo Grounds (III)]] in upper [[Manhattan|Manhattan, New York]]

The A's called on Chief Bender to turn the tables on the Giants. His opponent was 21-game winner &quot;Iron Man&quot; Joe McGinnity. The game was scoreless until the top of the third. Ossee Schreckengost, leading off, reached on a Dan McGann's error. Bender sacrificed, moving Schreckengost to second. After a groundout by Topsy Hartsel moved Schreckengost to third, Bris Lord singled to left and drove Ossee home with an unearned run. The slim margin held until the top of the eighth, when the A's put a crooked number on the board. With one out, Schreckengost was once again the catalyst, singling to center. After Bender flied out to right field, Hartsel's double scored Schreckengost all the way from first (helped by an error from Bresnahan), and a single by Lord brought Hartsel home, making it 3–0 in favor of the A's with all three runs unearned. Bender continued to cruise, got out of late-inning jams and ended up with a complete game shutout that tied the series at 1.

=== Game 3 ===
Thursday, October 12, 1905, at Columbia Park

Christy Mathewson once again took the mound for the Giants in Game 3. Opposing him this time was Andy Coakley, who hit the first batter he faced, [[Roger Bresnahan]], with a pitch. A single to right by Mike Donlin moved Bresnahan to third with one out. Dan McGann singled to right, bringing Bresnahan home. An error by Danny Murphy scored Donlin and put Sam Mertes on base. Bill Dahlen walked, loading the bases with one out, but Art Devlin hit into a double play to end the rally. The Giants put the game away in the top of the fifth. Bresnahan walked with one out. George Browne singled and went to second on the throw to third base. Donlin was walked intentionally, setting up a possible inning-ending double play, but things continued to crumble for Coakley and the A's. McGann reached on another error by Danny Murphy, reloading the bases and scoring a run. Mertes singled, reloading the bases and driving in another run. Bill Dahlen hit into a force play at second, scoring Donlin. After Dahlen stole second, Devlin singled, bringing home McGann and sending Dahlen to third. Devlin then stole second and Dahlen stole home on a double steal, scoring the fifth and last run of the Giants' fifth. They scored two more runs in the top of the ninth, when McGann doubled home Browne and Donlin. Mathewson pitched his second complete-game shutout, giving the Giants a 2–1 lead in the series. This was the first 9–0 World Series game. The next one had to wait until the Cubs shut out the Tigers by that lopsided score in Game 1 of the [[1945 World Series]], although Detroit, with [[Hank Greenberg]] and [[Hal Newhouser]], ended up taking that series four games to three.

=== Game 4 ===
Friday, October 13, 1905, at the Polo Grounds 

Eddie Plank returned for the A's against Joe McGinnity for the Giants in Game 4. Both left men on base in scoring position early on, and kept the game scoreless until the bottom of the fourth, when Sam Mertes led off the inning by reaching on an error by Monte Cross. After Bill Dahlen flied to right Art Devlin grounded out, moving Mertes to second. With two outs, Billy Gilbert singled to left, bringing Mertes home for the only run of the game, McGinnity outdueling Plank 1–0 and giving the Giants a three-games-to-one lead.

Saturday, October 14, 1905, at the Polo Grounds

With the arrival of the [[Beat Generation|&quot;beat&quot;]] writers and artists of the 1950s and societal changes culminating in the [[Summer of Love]] in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district during the 1960s, San Francisco became a center of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] activism and of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] that arose at that time. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and to a lesser extent the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] have dominated [[Politics of San Francisco|city politics]] since the late 1970s, after the [[John Barbagelata|last serious]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challenger for city office [[1975 San Francisco mayoral election|lost the 1975 mayoral election]] by a narrow margin. San Francisco has not voted more than 20% for a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential or senatorial candidate since [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

San Francisco also has had a very active environmental community.

[[File:Castro Rainbow Flag.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow flag]], symbol of [[LGBT]] pride, originated in San Francisco; banners like this one decorate streets in [[The Castro, San Francisco|The Castro]].]]
San Francisco has long had an [[LGBT]]-friendly [[LGBT culture in San Francisco|history]]. It was home to the first lesbian-rights organization in the United States, [[Daughters of Bilitis]]; the first openly gay person to run for public office in the United States, [[José Sarria]]; the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, [[Harvey Milk]]; the first openly lesbian judge appointed in the U.S., [[Mary C. Morgan]]; and the first [[transgender]] police commissioner, [[Theresa Sparks]]. The city's large gay population has created and sustained a politically and culturally active community over many decades, developing a powerful presence in San Francisco's civic life. Survey data released in 2015 by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] place the proportion of the San Francisco metro area at 6.2%, which is the highest such proportion observed of the 50 most populous metropolitan areas as measured by the polling organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco Metro Area Ranks Highest in LGBT Percentage|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/182051/san-francisco-metro-area-ranks-highest-lgbt-percentage.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular destinations for gay tourists internationally, the city hosts [[San Francisco Pride]], one of the largest and oldest [[pride parades]]. [[San Francisco Pride]] events have been held continuously since 1972. The events are themed and a new theme is created each year. In 2013, over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people attended, around 500,000 more than the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court victories boost gay pride parades|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/30/san-francisco-gay-pride-parade-gay-marriage/2473379/|website=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its unique city-county status, the local government is able to exercise jurisdiction over certain property outside city limits. [[San Francisco International Airport]], though located in [[San Mateo County]], is owned and operated by the City and County of San Francisco. San Francisco's largest jail complex (County Jail No. 5) is located in San Mateo County, in an [[unincorporated area]] adjacent to [[San Bruno, California|San Bruno]].

San Francisco serves as the regional hub for many arms of the federal bureaucracy, including the [[Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]], the [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|Federal Reserve Bank]], and the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]]. Until [[Base Realignment and Closure|decommissioning]] in the early 1990s, the city had major military installations at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]], [[Treasure Island, San Francisco|Treasure Island]], and [[San Francisco Naval Shipyard|Hunters Point]]—a legacy still reflected in the annual celebration of [[Fleet Week]].

The property lay dormant until 2003, when a new animated TV series also entitled ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' began to air on Fox Box ([[4Kids TV]]). The series storyline stuck much closer to the original Mirage comic book series, but was still less violent. It lasted for seven seasons and 156 episodes, ending in February 2009.

In 2009, cable channel [[Nickelodeon]] (a subsidiary of [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]], now known today as [[ViacomCBS]],) had purchased all of Mirage's rights to the ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' property. Mirage retained the rights to publish 18 issues a year, though the future involvement of Mirage with the Turtles and the future of Mirage Studios itself is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laird |first=Peter |title=palblog: Musings about the sale |date=October 21, 2009 |url=http://plairdblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/musings-about-sale.html |accessdate=October 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026145019/http://plairdblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/musings-about-sale.html |archive-date=October 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nickelodeon developed a new CGI-animated TMNT television series and partnered with fellow Viacom company [[Paramount Pictures]] to bring a new TMNT movie to theaters.

Due to financial underperformance, the plans for third film were cancelled and a new TMNT reboot is in development.

A new TV series from Nickelodeon, ''[[Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', was released in 2018 and is ongoing.

==Main characters==
{{main|List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters}}

*[[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] (Leo) – The tactical, level-headed, quiet, courageous leader and devoted student of his ''sensei'', Leonardo wears a blue mask and wields two swords&lt;!--normally referred to in-universe as Katanas, despite looking like Ninjato; may have changed since Leonardo's first appearance--&gt;. As the most conscientious of the four, he often bears the burden of responsibility for his brothers, which commonly leads to conflict with Raphael. Leonardo was named after the Italian polymath, painter, engineer, inventor, writer, anatomist, and sculptor, [[Leonardo da Vinci]].
*[[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] (Raph) – The team's [[antihero]], Raphael wears a red mask and wields a pair of [[Sai (weapon)|sai]]. He has an aggressive nature, and seldom hesitates to throw the first punch. He is often depicted with a [[New York accent]]. His personality can be fierce and sarcastic, and he oftentimes delivers [[deadpan]] humor. He is intensely loyal to his brothers and ''sensei''. He is named after the Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance, [[Raphael]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Origin&quot;/&gt;
*[[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]] (Mikey or Mike) –  The most stereotypical teenager of the team, Michelangelo is a free-spirited, relaxed, goofy, mischievous, jokester known for his love of pizza and kind-hearted nature. Michelangelo wears an orange mask and wields a pair of [[nunchaku]]. He provides the [[comic relief]], though he still has an adventurous side. The least mature of the four Turtles, he shows characteristics of a &quot;[[surfer]]&quot; type and is often depicted with a [[California English|Southern Californian]] accent. He is named after the Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, poet, and engineer, [[Michelangelo]]. His name was originally misspelled &quot;Michaelangelo&quot; by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman.&lt;ref name=Origin&gt;[http://www.ninjaturtles.com/origin/origin.htm TMNT Origin Story], official site. Retrieved November 16, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601071923/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/origin/origin.htm |date=June 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] (Donnie or Don) – The scientist, inventor, engineer, and technological genius, Donatello wears a purple mask and wields a [[Bō|bo (staff)]]. Donatello is perhaps the least violent turtle, preferring to use his knowledge to solve conflicts, but never hesitates to defend his brothers. He is named after the early Renaissance Italian artist and sculptor from Florence, [[Donatello]].
*[[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] – The Turtles' ''[[sensei]]'' and adoptive father. In the original comics, Splinter is a Japanese mutant rat that learned the ways of ninjutsu from his owner and master, [[Hamato Yoshi]]. His name and character are a parody of the Marvel Comics character Stick, who trained Matt Murdock/Daredevil. For the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 TV series]], Splinter's origin was changed so he is Hamato Yoshi himself mutated into a humanoid rat. In the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW Publishing)|IDW comics]], he is Hamato Yoshi reincarnated as a mutated rat. Other versions usually follow one of these origins.
*[[April O'Neil]] – A former lab assistant to the mad scientist [[Baxter Stockman]], April is the plucky human companion of the Turtles. April first met the Turtles when they saved her from Baxter's Mouser robots. She embarks on many of the Turtles' adventures and aids them by doing the work in public that the Turtles cannot. In the 1987 TV series, Archie Comics series, the first three films, and [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|the 2014 film reboot]], April is a television news reporter. In the [[TMNT (2007 film)|2007 CGI film]], she and Casey Jones own a shipping firm. In the 2012 series, April is a teenager who is rescued by the TMNTs and later given some &quot;crash courses&quot; in being a ninja by Splinter.
*[[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] – A vigilante who wears a [[hockey mask]] to protect his identity, Casey Jones has become one of the Turtles' closest allies, as well as a love interest to April. Casey first encountered the Turtles after having a fight with Raphael. He fights crime with an assortment of sporting goods he carries in a golf bag, such as baseball bats, golf clubs, and hockey sticks.
*[[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|The Shredder]] – A villainous [[ninjutsu]] master clad in armor called Oroku Saki, he is the leader of the [[Foot Clan]], an evil ninja clan (the followers of the Foot Clan aren't necessarily evil, as it appears that they are brainwashed local youth of all races that are tasked with carrying out illegal deeds of a mysterious higher order). In every incarnation of the TMNT franchise, he has been the arch-enemy of the Turtles and Splinter as well as the main antagonist in most installments of the franchise.
*[[Foot Ninja|Foot Soldiers/Ninjas]] – The ninjas of the [[Foot Clan]] who work for the Shredder.
*[[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]] – A female high-rank member of the Foot Clan, she has appeared in several different TMNT comics, cartoons, and films, as well as in multiple video games. In her original appearance she was a commander on the same level as Shredder while in some of her later incarnations of the character, she is closely related to Shredder as his adopted daughter or biological granddaughter as well second-in-command. In most works, she shares an ambiguous rivalry with Leonardo, which occasionally even borders on romantic interest.
*[[Baxter Stockman]] – Baxter Stockman is a scientist and inventor who often acts as an enemy to the Turtles in various incarnations. He is known as the inventor of the mouser robots that appear in many versions, and is often depicted as allied with the Foot Clan, Krang, or going on his own.
*[[Krang]] – Krang is a small brain-like alien warlord who often appears as one of the main villains of the franchise alongside The Shredder. The character was originally inspired by the Utroms, an alien race from the original comics, while in later versions he is a member of the Utroms. In some incarnations Krang teamed up with Shredder while some versions have them as rivals for conquest.
*[[Bebop and Rocksteady]] – A criminal duo of a mutant warthog and rhinoceros, respectively, who were originally two human thugs who become the Shredder's henchmen in some versions. They are usually depicted as super-strong but not very smart and often serve as comic relief.

==Comics==
===Mirage===
{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)}}

Eastman and Laird's ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' premiered in May 1984, at a comic book convention held at a local Sheraton Hotel in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. It was published by [[Mirage Studios]] in an oversized magazine-style format using black and white artwork on cheap newsprint, limited to a print run of 3,250 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= DYNAMIC DUO: Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird; Turning Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Into a Monster|work= The New York Times|date=December 25, 1988|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/25/business/dynamic-duo-kevin-eastman-peter-laird-turning-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-into.html?scp=1&amp;sq=ninja%20turtles&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=2|accessdate=August 7, 2010 | first=Douglas C. | last=McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a clever media kit that included a press release in ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #89 and a full-page ad placed in ''Comic Buyer's Guide #547'', the public's interest was piqued and thus began the Turtle phenomenon. The small print runs made these early comics and trade magazines instant collector items, and within months, they were trading for over 50 times their cover price. The name &quot;Mirage Studios&quot; was chosen because of Eastman and Laird's lack of a professional art studio at the start of their career, before their creation made them both multimillionaires.

Mirage also published a bimonthly companion book entitled ''[[Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', featuring art by [[Ryan Brown (comics)|Ryan Brown]] and [[Jim Lawson (comic book writer)|Jim Lawson]], which was designed to fill in the gaps of continuity in the TMNT universe. This put the original series and ''Tales'' in the same mainstream [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. The title's first volume was from 1987–1989, released in alternating months with the regular Eastman and Laird book. All seven issues of volume one have been collected in trade paperback form twice, and 25 issues of volume two have been collected in trades of five issues each.

As the TMNT phenomenon proliferated to other media, Eastman and Laird found themselves administrating an international merchandising juggernaut. However, this prevented the two creators from participating in the day-to-day work of writing and illustrating a monthly comic book. So, many guest artists were invited to showcase their unique talents in the TMNT universe. The breadth of diversity found in the various short stories gave the series a disjointed, [[anthology|anthology-like]] feel. Fans stuck with the series, and what was originally intended as a one-shot became a continuing series that lasted for 129 issues, spanning four separate volumes (having 62, 13, 23, and 32 issues in the four distinct volumes).

In June 1996, [[Image Comics]] took over publishing the title in what is considered &quot;volume 3&quot; of the series. It was a slightly more action-oriented TMNT series and although notable for inflicting major physical changes on the main characters, Peter Laird, co-creator of the TMNT, has said this volume is no longer in canon as he began publishing volume 4 at Mirage Publishing in the early 2000s. As an explanation, he offered in the pages of the volume 4 (issue #8) letter column: &quot;It just didn't feel right&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teenagemutantninjaturtles.com/history-ninja-turtles/ |title=History of the Ninja Turtles |publisher=TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles.com |website=TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles.com |accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking back the series from Image Comics, Mirage Studios resumed publication of a fourth volume in December 2001, under the simple title ''TMNT''. After the publication of issue number 28, writer Peter Laird placed the series on an eight-month hiatus to devote himself to production of the 2007 ''TMNT'' movie. However, after that eight months had passed, Mirage's official website went on to list the series as in &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot;. In January 2008, Mirage had finally confirmed that the series would return in May 2008. Issues 29 and 30 had a limited printing of 1,000 copies each, and were available through the official TMNT website. Although the purchase agreement with Nickelodeon allows Laird to produce up to 18 comics a year set in the original Mirage continuity, no new material was released in the next few years. The latest issue of TMNT volume 4 was issue #32 which came out in print May 4, 2014, and online on May 9, 2014, almost 4 years after issue #31 was last released. &lt;!-- It is not known when this series will be continued or be concluded.
 --&gt;

===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures''===
{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures}}
''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures]]'' was a comic-book series published from August 1988 to October 1995 by [[Archie Comics]]. The initial storylines were close adaptations of the 1987 TV series, but with the fifth issue, Eastman and Laird decided to hand the series over to Mirage Studios employees [[Ryan Brown (comics)|Ryan Brown]] and [[Stephen Murphy (comics)|Stephen Murphy]], who immediately abandoned the animated series adaptations and took the title in a decidedly different direction with all-new original adventures, including the uniting of several of the series' recurring characters as a separate team, the [[Mighty Mutanimals]].

===Dreamwave===
{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Dreamwave Productions)}}
A monthly comic inspired by the 2003 TV series was published by [[Dreamwave Productions]] from June to December 2003. It was written by [[Peter David]] and illustrated by [[LeSean Thomas]]. In the first four issues, which were the only ones directly adapted from the TV series, the story was told from the perspectives of April, Baxter, Casey, and a pair of New York City police officers.

===IDW===
{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW Publishing)}}
In 2011, [[IDW Publishing]] acquired the license to publish new collections of Mirage storylines and a new ongoing series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idwpublishing.com/news/article/1677/ IDW Announces New Comic Series Based on the Original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407141041/http://www.idwpublishing.com/news/article/1677 |date=April 7, 2011 }} [[IDW Publishing]] April 1, 2011 Accessed April 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW Publishing)|the new series]] was released on August 24 that year. Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz wrote the book, with Eastman and Dan Duncan providing art.

===Manga===
The Turtles have appeared in several ''[[manga]]'' series.
*{{Nihongo|''Mutant Turtles''|ミュータント・タートルズ|Myūtanto Tātoruzu}} is a 15-issue series by Tsutomu Oyamada, Zuki mora, and Yoshimi Hamada that simply adapted episodes of the original American animated series.
*''Super Turtles'' (スーパータートルズ ''Sūpā Tātoruzu'') is a three-issue miniseries by Hidemasa Idemitsu, Tetsurō Kawade, and Toshio Kudō that featured the &quot;TMNT Supermutants&quot; Turtle toys that were on sale at the time. The first volume of the anime miniseries followed this storyline.
*{{Nihongo|''Mutant Turtles Gaiden''|ミュータント・タートルズ外伝|Myūtanto Tātoruzu Gaiden}} by Hiroshi Kanno is a reinterpretation of the Turtles story with no connection to the previous manga.
*{{Nihongo|''Mutant Turtles III''|ミュータント・タートルズ３|Myūtanto Tātoruzu Tsuri}} is Yasuhiko Hachino's adaptation of the third feature film.
*{{Nihongo|''Mutant Turtles '95''|ミュータント・タートルズ９５|Myūtanto Tātoruzu Kyūjūgo}} is a 1995 series by Ogata Nobu which ran in Comic BomBom.
*{{Nihongo|''Mutant Turtles '96''|ミュータント・タートルズ９６|Myūtanto Tātoruzu Kyūjūroku}} is a continuation of the 1995 series when it continued to run through 1996.

===Comic strip===
{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (comic strip)}}

A [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (comic strip)|daily comic strip]] written and illustrated by Dan Berger began in 1990.  It featured an adventure story Monday through Friday and activity puzzles on weekends (with fan art appearing later). The comic strip was published in [[Print syndication|syndication]] until its cancellation in December 1996. At its highest point in popularity, it was published in over 250 newspapers.

[[File:TMNT1987Series.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Logo of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 cartoon]]]]

When little-known Playmates Toys was approached about producing a TMNTs action figure line, they were cautious of the risk and requested that a television deal be acquired first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/about_the_creators.html#4 About the Creators] TMNT25.com (January 2009).

The series was produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson Film Productions, Inc. (later [[Fred Wolf Films Dublin|Fred Wolf Films]]). Mirage Studios does not own the rights to this cartoon series. The show is more lighthearted than the comics. Here, the Turtles are portrayed as four funny but serious superheroes that fight the forces of evil from their sewer hideout. They love [[pizza]] and put weird toppings on it. They make their first appearance in masks color-coded to each turtle, where previously they had all worn red.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles On TV&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title= Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles On TV|work= IGN|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/774/774796p1.html|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turtles were also well known for their use of idiomatic expressions characteristic of the surfer lingo of the time, especially by Michelangelo. Words and phrases included &quot;bummer&quot;, &quot;dude&quot;, &quot;bogus&quot;, &quot;radical&quot;, &quot;far-out&quot;, &quot;tubuloso&quot;, &quot;bodacious&quot;, and possibly the most recognized, &quot;cowabunga,&quot; a nonsense expression first coined by ''[[The Howdy Doody Show]]''{{'}}s Chief Thunderthud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/ninja_pedia.html |title=The Official TMNT Web Site! |publisher=Tmnt25.com |accessdate=August 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414155020/http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/ninja_pedia.html |archive-date=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast included new and different characters, such as [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] and the Neutrinos. Original characters such as [[Splinter (TMNT)|Splinter]], [[Shredder (TMNT)|Shredder]], and the [[Foot Clan|Foot Soldiers]] stayed true to the comics in appearance and alignment only. Instead of being Hamato Yoshi's mutated pet rat, Splinter was a mutated Hamato himself. The Foot Soldiers changed from human ninjas to an endless supply of robotic grunts, allowing large numbers of them to be destroyed without anyone dying (this was a very important decision in terms of the show's child audience; excessive violence would have alienated parents of children, the show's target demographic). [[Krang]], one of the series' most memorable villains, was inspired by the design of the Utrom, a benign alien race from the Mirage comics. The animated Krang, however, was instead an evil warlord from [[Dimension X (TMNT)|Dimension X]]. [[Baxter Stockman]], whose race was changed from [[black people|black]] to [[white people|white]], was rewritten as a shy and meek lackey to Shredder, later mutating into an anthropomorphic [[housefly]]. During the final two seasons of the show, the lead villain switched to Lord Dregg, an evil alien overlord bent on world conquest by trying to distract the public into believing that the Turtles were the enemy instead of himself.

Starting on September 25, 1989, the series was expanded to weekdays and it had 47 more episodes for the new season. There were 28 new syndicated episodes for season 4 and only 13 of those episodes aired in 1990. The &quot;European Vacation&quot; episodes were not seen in the United States until [[USA Network]] started showing reruns in late 1993 and the &quot;Awesome Easter&quot; episodes were not seen until 1991. These episodes were delayed because of animation or scheduling problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0131613/trivia &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (1987/I) – Trivia] IMDB.com (February 2019). Retrieved on 2–21–09.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 1990, a drug-prevention television special was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[CBS]] named ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]'' that featured some of the most popular cartoons at the time; representing TMNT was Michelangelo, voiced by Townsend Coleman.

Starting on September 8, 1990 (with a different opening sequence), the show began its run on CBS. The CBS weekend edition ran for a full hour until 1994, initially airing a few Saturday-exclusive episodes back-to-back. Also, a brief &quot;Turtle Tips&quot; segment aired between the two episodes, which served as public-service announcement about the environment or other issues.  After 1994, the show was reduced to just a half-hour and only eight episodes per season were produced, grouped into a &quot;CBS Action Zone&quot; block that also featured ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.s.]]'' and ''[[Skeleton Warriors]]'', both of which were canceled after one season; though TMNTs retained their &quot;Action Zone&quot; introduction. The series ran until November 2, 1996, when it aired its final episode. Its enormous popularity gave rise to its numerous imitators, including the ''[[Battletoads]]'', ''[[Cheetahmen]]'', ''[[Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa]]'', ''[[Road Rovers]]'', ''[[Street Sharks]]'', ''[[Extreme Dinosaurs]]'', and ''[[Biker Mice from Mars]]''. Currently, all 193 episodes are available on [[DVD]] and [[VHS]].

===Original video animation===
{{Main|Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen}}

In addition to the American series, a Japan-exclusive two-episode [[anime]] [[original video animation]] (OVA) series was made in 1996, titled ''Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen''. The OVA is similar in tone to the 1987 TV series and uses the same voices from [[TV Tokyo]]'s Japanese dub of the 1987 TV series. The first episode was made to advertise the ''TMNT Supermutants'' toys. It featured the Turtles as [[superhero]]es, that gained costumes and superpowers with the use of Mutastones, while Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady gained supervillain powers with the use of a Dark Mutastone. As with the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' and ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchises, the four Turtles could combine to form the giant Turtle Saint. The second episode was created to advertise the ''Metal Mutants'' toys in which the characters gain ''[[Saint Seiya]]''-esque mystical metal armor that can transform into beasts.

===Live-action series (1997–1998)===
[[File:Ninja Turtles, The Next Mutation.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Logo of [[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation|the live-action series]]]]
{{Main|Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation}}

In 1997–1998, the Turtles starred in a live-action television series called ''Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation'' that directly follows the events of the first three movies. A fifth turtle was introduced, a female named [[Venus (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Venus de Milo]], who was skilled in the mystical arts of the ''[[ninja|shinobi]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles On TV&quot;/&gt; The series was intended as a loose continuation of the movie franchise, as Shredder had been defeated and the Ninja Turtles encountered new villains. Other connections to the feature films include the fact that Splinter's ear was cut, the Foot Soldiers were humans, and the Turtles lived in the abandoned subway station seen in the second and third movies. ''The Next Mutation'' Turtles made a guest appearance on ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles On TV|work= IGN|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/774/774796p2.html|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was canceled after one season of 26 episodes.

===Second animated series (2003–2009)===
[[File:TMNT03TVLOGO.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Logo of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003 cartoon]]]]
{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)}}

In 2003, a new TMNT series produced by [[4Kids Entertainment]] began airing on the &quot;[[FoxBox]]&quot; (later renamed &quot;[[4Kids TV]]&quot;) programming block. It later moved to &quot;[[The CW4Kids]]&quot; block. The series was co-produced by Mirage Studios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= TMNT Celebrates 25 Years, III – Peter Laird |work= Newsarama|url= http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080610-TMNT25-Laird.html|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mirage owned one-third of the rights to the series. Mirage's significant stake in creative control resulted in a cartoon that hews more closely to the original comics, creating a darker and edgier feel than the 1987 cartoon, but still child-friendly enough to be considered appropriate for children.

This series lasted until 2009, ending with a feature-length television movie titled ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', which was produced in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the TMNTs franchise and featured the Turtles of the 2003 series teaming up with their counterparts from the 1987 series, and eventually are visited by the black and white comic versions of themselves in the final act. 4Kidstv.com featured all the episodes of the series, until September 2010, when Nickelodeon bought the series and air the series occasionally on Nicktoons and Nickelodeon normally during TMNTs marathons.

==Feature films==
{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in film}}

The Turtles have appeared in [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in film|six feature films]]. The first three are live-action features produced in the early 1990s: ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (1990), ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' (1991), and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'' (1993). The Turtles were played by various actors in costumes featuring [[animatronic]] heads, initially produced by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]]. The fourth film, a CGI-animated film titled simply ''[[TMNT (film)|TMNT]]'', was released in 2007.

A reboot, also titled ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' produced by Platinum Dunes, Nickelodeon Movies, and Paramount Pictures, directed by Jonathan Liebesman, and produced by Michael Bay, was released in 2014. A sequel titled ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]'' was released in 2016. A crossover film, called ''[[Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', was recently released in 2019.

==Merchandise==
Among the first licensed products to feature the TMNT was a [[tabletop role-playing game]] titled ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness]]'', published by [[Palladium Books]] in 1985, and featuring original comics and illustrations by Eastman and Laird. The game features a large list of animals, including elephants and sparrows, that are available as mutant [[player character]]s. Several more titles were in this genre, including ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures (role-playing game supplement)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures]]'', ''[[Truckin' Turtles]]'', ''[[Turtles Go Hollywood]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Guide to the Universe]]'', and ''[[Transdimensional Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.

In 1986, Dark Horse Miniatures in Boise, Idaho, produced an attendant set of lead [[figurine]]s; unlike later incarnations, the bandannas on the store's display set were painted all black before the multicolored versions were released to help younger readers distinguish between the four characters other than their weaponry. Palladium allowed the license to lapse in 2000, in part due to declining sales stemming from the &quot;kiddification&quot; of the animated and live-action incarnations to that point. However, Palladium's publisher, [[Kevin Siembieda]], has indicated a potential willingness to revisit the license given the franchise's recent moves closer to its roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordings.talkshoe.com/TS-9655.mp3 |title=Kevin Siembieda Interview, Part 2|date=February 19, 2007 |last=Meadows |first=Chris |accessdate=February 20, 2007 |format=mp3 |work=Space Station Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The franchise generated merchandise sales of {{US$|175 million|long=no}} in 1988 and {{US$|350 million|long=no}} in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fictional Persona Test: Copyright Preemption in Human Audiovisual Characters |journal=[[Cardozo Law Review]] |date=1998 |volume=20 |issue=1 |page=356 |url=https://scholarship.law.tamu.edu/facscholar/505 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, it was the most merchandisable franchise, having generated a total revenue of {{US$|6 billion|long=no}} in merchandise sales up until then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramirez|first=Anthony|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/style/gold-in-bedrock.html?pagewanted=all|title=Gold In Bedrock?|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=May 22, 1994|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toys===
{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures}}

During the run of the 1987 TV series, Playmates Toys produced hundreds of TMNT [[action figure]]s, along with vehicles, [[playset]]s, and accessories, becoming one of the top collectibles for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Rapid-Paced Turtle Sales Starting to Slow Down : Toys: Rival manufacturers see a cooling of the 'Ninja' fad as a chance to regain a larger share of the market. |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=December 23, 1991|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-23/business/fi-809_1_toy-manufacturers|accessdate=November 9, 2010|first=Carla|last=Lazzareschi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staff artists at Northampton, Massachusetts-based Mirage Studios provided conceptual designs for many of the figures, vehicles, and playsets and creator credit can be found in the legal text printed on the back of the toy packaging. In addition, Playmates produced a series of TMNTs/''[[Star Trek]]'' crossover figures, due to Playmates holding the ''Star Trek'' action-figure license at the time. Playmates employed many design groups to develop looks and styles for the toy line, including Bloom Design, White Design, [[Pangea Corporation|Pangea]], Robinson-Clarke, and McHale Design. The marketing vice president of Playmates, Karl Aaronian, was largely responsible for assembling the talented team of designers and writers, which in turn, helped germinate continued interest in the toy line.

Never before in toy history did an action-figure line have such an impact for over two decades, generating billions of dollars in licensing revenue. The series was highly popular in the UK, where in the run-up to Christmas, the [[Army &amp; Navy Stores (United Kingdom)|Army &amp; Navy Store]] in London's [[Lewisham]] devoted its entire basement to everything Turtle, including games, videos, costumes, and other items. Playmates continued to produce TMNT action figures based on the 2003 animated series. The 2007 film ''TMNT'' also gave Playmates a new source from which to make figures, while [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] produced a series of high-quality action figures based on character designs from the original Mirage comics. In 2012, a new toy line and a new classic toy line from Playmates were announced to be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/02/01/new-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-toys-playmates-2012/ |title=Playmates Reveals 2012 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Action Figures – ComicsAlliance &amp;#124; Comic book culture, news, humor, commentary, and reviews |work=ComicsAlliance |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618061436/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/02/01/new-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-toys-playmates-2012 |archive-date=June 18, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tabletop role playing game===
In 1985, [[Palladium Books]] published ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness|first=Erick|last=Wujcik|date=1988|publisher=Palladium Books|last2=Laird|first2=Peter|last3=Eastman|first3=Kevin|isbn=0916211142|edition=Revised|oclc=20101871}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a stand-alone game, as well as acting as an expansion for their game ''[[Rifts (roleplaying game)|Rifts]]''. The game used many key mechanics from the Palladium system. The game itself is limited as to which martial arts are available, but a separate book, ''[[Ninjas and Superspies]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/palladiumbookspr00wujc|title=Ninjas &amp; Superspies|first=Erick|last=Wujcik|date=1990|publisher=Palladium Books|isbn=0916211312|edition=Rev|oclc=24330062|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased the amount available to a choice of 41 martial arts styles.

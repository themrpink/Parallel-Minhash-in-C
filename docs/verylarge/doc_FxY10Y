      <text bytes="1172" xml:space="preserve">'''Wink''' is used both in connection with DC signaling on a trunk, and with indicator lamps on a key telephone.

In [[telephone switching]] systems, '''wink pulsing''' is recurring [[pulse (signal processing)|pulsing]] in which the off-condition is relatively short compared to the on-condition.  In '''Wink start''' trunks, the exchange at the originating end sends an [[off-hook]] to alert to a call.  The terminating end indicates readiness to receive the dialed [[telephone number]] by sending an off-hook of approximately half a second duration, or &quot;wink&quot;.  Upon receiving this go ahead signal, the originating end uses [[multi-frequency]] or other address signalling to send the phone number.

On [[1A2 Key System|1A2 key systems]] or similar key-operated telephone instruments, the hold position, ''i.e.,'' the hold condition, of a [[telephone line|line]] is often indicated by '''wink'''ing the associated lamp at 120 impulses per minute. During 6% of the [[pulse period]] the lamp is off and 94% of the period the lamp is on, ''i.e.,'' 30 ms (milliseconds) off and 470 ms on.

'''[[Wireless]] mobility management''' in [[Personal Communications Service]] (PCS) is the assigning and controlling of wireless links for [[computer terminal|terminal]] [[computer network|network]] connections. Wireless mobility management provides an &quot;alerting&quot; function for [[Telecommunication|call]] completion to a [[wireless terminal]], monitors wireless [[data link|link]] performance to determine when an automatic link transfer is required, and coordinates link transfers between wireless [[Access network|access]] [[Network interface|interface]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telecommunications: Glossary of Telecommunication Terms|url=http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm|publisher=its.bldrdoc.gov|accessdate=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One use of this is wireless [[push technology]], by pushing data across wireless networks, this coordinates the link transfers and pushes data between the [[Gateway (telecommunications)|backend]] and wireless device only when an established connection is found.

In a [[single-mode optical fiber]], the '''zero-dispersion wavelength''' is the [[wavelength]] or wavelengths at which material [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] and [[waveguide]] dispersion cancel one another. In all [[silica]]-based [[optical fiber]]s, minimum material dispersion occurs naturally at a wavelength of approximately 1300&amp;nbsp;nm. Single-mode fibers may be made of silica-based glasses containing dopants that shift the material-dispersion wavelength, and thus, the zero-dispersion wavelength, toward the [[minimum-loss window]] at approximately 1550&amp;nbsp;nm. The engineering tradeoff is a slight increase in the minimum [[attenuation coefficient]]. Such fiber is called [[dispersion-shifted fiber]].

Another way to alter the dispersion is changing the core size and the refractive indices of the material of [[Fiber optics#Principle of operation|core]] and [[Cladding (fiber optics)|cladding]]. Because fiber optic materials are already highly optimized for low scattering and high transparency alternative ways to change the refractive index were investigated. As a straightforward solution [[tapered fiber]]s and [[holey fiber]]s or [[photonic crystal fiber]]s (PCF) were produced. Essentially they replace the cladding by air. This improves the contrast of refractive indices by a factor of 10. Therefore, the effective index is changed, especially for longer wavelengths. This type of refractive index change versus wavelength due to different geometry is called [[waveguide dispersion]].
As these narrow waveguides (~1-3&amp;nbsp;μm core diameter) are combined with [[ultrashort pulse]]s at the zero-dispersion wavelength pulses are not instantly destroyed by dispersion. After reaching a certain peak power within the pulse the [[non-linear refractive index]] starts to play an important role leading to frequency generation processes like [[self-phase modulation]] (SPM), [[modulational instability]], [[soliton (optics)|soliton]] generation and [[soliton fission]], [[cross phase modulation]] (XPM) and others. All these processes generate new frequency components, meaning that input light with narrow bandwidth expands into a wide range of new colours, through a process called [[supercontinuum generation]].

The term is also used, more loosely, in [[multi-mode optical fiber]]. There, it refers to the wavelength at which the material dispersion is minimum, ''i.e.'' ''essentially'' zero. This is more accurately called the '''minimum-dispersion wavelength'''.

==Zero-dispersion slope==
The rate of change of dispersion with respect to wavelength at the zero-dispersion point is called the '''zero-dispersion slope'''. [[Doubly clad fiber|Doubly]] and [[Quadruply clad fiber|quadruply clad]] single-mode fibers have two zero-dispersion points.

{{distinguish|Zip-line}}

'''Zip-cord''' is a type of [[electrical cable]] with  two or more conductors held together by an insulating jacket that can be easily separated simply by pulling apart.  In Australia it is known as 'figure-8' cable.&lt;ref name=&quot;electracables-fig8&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Figure-8 |url=http://electracables.com.au/index.php?page=flexible-cables-figure-8 |website=electracables.com.au |accessdate=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zip-cord term is also used with optical fiber cables consisting of two optical fibers joined in a similar manner. The design of zip-cord makes it easy to keep conductors that carry related electrical or optical signals together and helps avoid tangling of cables. Typical uses include [[lamp cord]] and [[speaker wire]]. Conductors may be identified by a color tracer on the insulation, or by a ridge molded into the insulation of one wire, or by a colored tracer thread inside the insulation.  Zip cords are intended for use on portable equipment, and the US and Canadian electrical codes do not permit their use for [[building wiring|permanently installed wiring]] of line-voltage circuits.

{{redirect-distinguish|Perfect pitch|Pitch Perfect}}
'''Absolute pitch''' ('''AP'''), often called '''perfect pitch''', is a rare ability of a person to identify or re-create a given [[musical note]] without the benefit of a [[reference tone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;phil-494&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Deutsch, D. | chapter=Absolute pitch |editor=D. Deutsch | title=The Psychology of Music |edition=3rd | pages=141–182 | year=2013 |doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-381460-9.00005-5 | isbn=9780123814609 |chapter-url=http://philomel.com/pdf/PsyMus_3_Ch5_Absolute_Pitch.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, W.D. |year=1998 |title=The Psychology of Music |chapter=Absolute Pitch |editor=D. Deutsch |pages=265–298 |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |isbn=0-12-213564-4|edition=Second }}&lt;/ref&gt; AP may be demonstrated using linguistic labeling (&quot;naming&quot; a note), associating mental imagery with the note, or sensorimotor responses. For example, an AP possessor can accurately reproduce a heard tone on a musical instrument without &quot;hunting&quot; for the correct pitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zatorre, 1989&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert |last1=Zatorre |year=1989 |title=Multiple coding strategies in the retention of musical tones by possessors of absolute pitch|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|volume= 17 |issue=5 |pages=582–589 |doi=10.3758/BF03197081 |pmid=2796743 |last2=Beckett |first2=Christine|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zatorre, 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Zatorre |date=July 2003 |title=Absolute pitch: a model for understanding the influence of genes and development on neural and cognitive function |journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=692–695 |doi=10.1038/nn1085 |pmid=12830161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency of AP in the general population is not known. The assumed occurrence of less than 1 in 10,000 is widely reported, but it is not supported by evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bachem, 1955&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bachem |first1=A. |title=Absolute Pitch |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date=November 1955 |volume=27 |issue=6 |page=1180 |doi=10.1121/1.1908155|bibcode=1955ASAJ...27.1180B }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2019 review of more recent and international studies indicates prevalence of at least 4% amongst music students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Carden|first1=Jill|last2=Cline|first2=Tony|date=July 9, 2019|title=Absolute pitch: Myths, evidence and relevance to music education and performance|journal=Psychology of Music|volume=47|issue=6|language=en-US|pages=890–901|doi=10.1177/0305735619856098|issn=0305-7356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, absolute pitch implies some or all of the following abilities, achieved without a reference tone:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Parncutt, R. |author2=Levitin, D. J. |year=2001 |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |chapter=Absolute Pitch |editor=Sadie, S. |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=1-56159-239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify by name individual [[pitch (music)|pitches]] (e.g. F{{music|sharp}}, A, G, C) played on various instruments.
* Name the [[key (music)|key]] of a given piece of tonal music.
* Identify and name all the tones of a given [[chord (music)|chord]] or other tonal mass.
* Accurately sing a named pitch.
* Name the pitches of common everyday sounds such as [[vehicle horn|car horns]] and [[Alarm device|alarms]].

People may have absolute pitch along with the ability of [[relative pitch]], and relative and absolute pitch work together in actual musical listening and practice, but strategies in using each skill vary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miyazaki, 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken'ichi |last=Miyazaki |date=June 2004 |title=How well do we understand absolute pitch? |journal=Acoustical Science and Technology|volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=270–282 |doi=10.1250/ast.25.426 |url=http://psyche.ge.niigata-u.ac.jp/Psyche/Miyazaki/Papers/Miyazaki2004.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816070421/http://psyche.ge.niigata-u.ac.jp/Psyche/Miyazaki/Papers/Miyazaki2004.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults who possess relative pitch but do not already have absolute pitch can learn &quot;pseudo-absolute pitch&quot; and become able to identify notes in a way that superficially resembles absolute pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Levitin, D.J. |year=2008 |title=Music Meets Medicine, Proceedings of the Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation |chapter=Absolute pitch: Both a curse and a blessing |editor1=Clockars, M. |editor2=Peltomaa, M. |pages=124–132 |publisher=Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation |location=Helsinki, Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain people who train to name notes may indeed become able to identify all 12 notes of the scale with 90% accuracy or above,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv|title=Is it impossible to acquire absolute pitch in adulthood?|first1=Alan C.-N.|last1=Wong|first2=Ken H.

==Scientific studies==

===History of study and terminologies===

Just as most people have learned to recognize and name the color ''blue'' by the range of frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that are perceived as [[light]], it is possible that those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life will be more likely to identify, for example, the note C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Takeuchi, A.

===Influence by music experience===
Absolute pitch sense appears to be influenced by cultural exposure to music, especially in the familiarization of the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] [[musical scale|C-major scale]]. Most of the absolute listeners that were tested in this respect identified the C-major tones more reliably and, except for B, more quickly than the five &quot;black key&quot; tones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=The speed of musical pitch identification by absolute-pitch possessors |journal=Music Perception |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=177–188 |doi=10.2307/40285495|jstor=40285495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to the higher prevalence of these tones in ordinary musical experience. One study of Dutch non-musicians also demonstrated a bias toward using C-major tones in ordinary speech, especially on syllables related to emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braun, M. |title=Absolute pitch in emphasized speech |journal=Acoustics Research Letters Online|volume=3 |year=2002 |pages=77–82 |doi=10.1121/1.1472336 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
Absolute pitch is more common among speakers of [[tonal language]]s, such as most dialects of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which often depend on pitch variation as the means of distinguishing words that otherwise sound the same—e.g., [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] with four possible tonal variations, [[Cantonese]] with six, [[Southern Min]] with seven or eight (depending on dialect), and Vietnamese with six.&lt;ref name=jasa138th&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Dolson | first3 = M. | title = Tone Language Speakers Possess Absolute Pitch | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|year=1999 | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | page = 2267 |lay-url=http://www.acoustics.org/press/138th/deutsch.htm|laysource=Acoustics.org | doi=10.1121/1.427738|bibcode = 1999ASAJ..106.2267D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jasa148th&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Marvin | first3 = E. | last4 = Xu | first4 = H. | title = Perfect Pitch in Tone Language Speakers Carries Over to Music | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|year= 2005 | volume = 116 | issue = 4 | page = 2580 |laysource=AIP|lay-url=http://www.aip.org/148th/deutsch.html | doi = 10.1121/1.4808626 |bibcode = 2004ASAJ..116.2580D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] have been reported to speak a word in the same absolute pitch (within a quarter-tone) on different days; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they learn to speak a tonal language&lt;ref name=&quot;deu-2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Henthorn T. |author3=Dolson, M. |title=Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework |journal=Music Perception|volume=21 |pages=339–356 |year=2004 |doi=10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339 |issue=3|url=http://philomel.com/pdf/MP-2004-21_339-356.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; (and possibly also by infants when they learn to speak a [[Pitch accent|pitch-accent language]]).

Many native speakers of a tone language, even those with little musical training, are observed to sing a given song consistently with regard to pitch.

===Pitch memory related to musical context===

This phenomenon is apparently unrelated to musical training. The skill may be associated more closely with vocal production. Violin students learning the [[Suzuki method]] are required to memorize each composition in a fixed key and play it from memory on their instrument, but they are not required to sing. When tested, these students did not succeed in singing the memorized Suzuki songs in the original, fixed key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Saah, Victoria |author2=Marvin, Elizabeth West |year=2004 |chapter=Absolute memory of learned melodies in children trained by the Suzuki violin method |title=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition|pages=736–739 |chapter-url=http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810004816/http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |archive-date=August 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible problems===
Musicians with absolute perception may experience difficulties which do not exist for other musicians. Because absolute listeners are capable of recognizing that a musical composition has been transposed from its original key, or that a pitch is being produced at a nonstandard frequency (either sharp or flat), a musician with absolute pitch may become distressed upon perceiving tones believed to be &quot;wrong&quot; or hearing a piece of music &quot;in the wrong key&quot;. This can especially apply to Baroque music that is recorded in Baroque tuning (usually A = 415&amp;nbsp;Hz as opposed to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, ''i.e.'', roughly a half step or [[semitone]] lower than standard concert pitch).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacks, O. 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Sacks, O. |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain |url=https://archive.org/details/musicophilia00oliv |url-access=registration |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4000-4081-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; An absolute listener may also use absolute strategies for tasks which are more efficiently accomplished with [[relative pitch|relative strategies]], such as transposition&lt;ref name=&quot;miy_1993&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=Absolute pitch as an inability: Identification of musical intervals in a tonal context |journal=Music Perception |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=55–72 |doi=10.2307/40285599|jstor=40285599}}&lt;/ref&gt; or producing harmony for tones whose frequencies do not match standard [[equal temperament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, G. B. |year=1974 |title=Categorical perception and absolute pitch |publisher=University of Western Ontario |location=Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible for some musicians to have displaced absolute pitch, where all notes are slightly flat or slightly sharp of their respective pitch as defined by a given convention.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This may arise from learning the pitch names from an instrument that was tuned to a concert pitch convention other than the one in use, ''e.g.'', A = 435&amp;nbsp;Hz (the [[Paris Opera]] convention of the late 19th and early 20th centuries) as opposed to the Anglo-American modern standard A = 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. When playing in groups with other musicians, this may lead to playing in a tonality that is slightly different from that of the rest of the group.{{citation needed|date = January 2020}}

===Synesthesia===
Absolute pitch shows a genetic overlap with music-related and non-music-related [[synesthesia]]/[[ideasthesia]].&lt;ref name=gregersen_2013/&gt; They may associate certain notes or keys with different colors, enabling them to tell what any note or key is. In this study, about 20% of people with perfect pitch are also synesthetes.

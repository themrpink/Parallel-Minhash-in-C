While the battle was underway at Yudam-ni, the PVA 59th Division blocked the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri by attacking the defending Charlie and Fox Companies of the 7th Marines.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|227}} The successful assault forced Charlie Company to retreat into Yudam-ni, which left Fox Company commanded by Captain [[William E. Barber]] isolated on a hill overlooking the Toktong Pass, a vital pass that controlled the road.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|73}} On 29 November, several efforts by the 7th Marines failed to rescue Fox Company, despite inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|178}} Aided by artillery from Hagaru-ri and Marine [[F4U Corsair|Corsair fighters]], Fox Company managed to hold out for five days while enduring constant attacks by the PVA 59th Division.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|226}}

After the heavy losses suffered by the PVA 79th Division at Yudam-ni, 9th Army headquarters realized that the bulk of the 1st Marine Division was stationed at Yudam-ni, with a garrison strength that was double the initial estimate.&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|329}} Believing that any further assaults would be futile, Song Shilun ordered the 9th Army to switch their main attacks toward Sinhung-ni and Hagaru-ri,&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|329}} leaving Yudam-ni alone from 28 to 30 November.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|213}} At the same time, the US Eighth Army on the Korean western front was forced into full retreat at the [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River]], and MacArthur ordered Almond to withdraw the US X Corps to the port of Hungnam.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|120–1}} Acting on the instruction of Almond and Smith, Lieutenant Colonel [[Raymond L.

For the breakout, the Marines formed into a convoy with a single [[M4 Sherman|M4A3 Sherman tank]] as the lead. The plan was to have [[3rd Battalion 5th Marines|3rd Battalion, 5th Marines]] (3/5) as the vanguard of the convoy, with three battalions covering the rear. At the same time, [[1st Battalion 7th Marines|1st Battalion, 7th Marines]] (1/7) would attack towards Fox Company in order to open the road at Toktong Pass.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|215–6}} To start the breakout, [[3rd Battalion 7th Marines|3rd Battalion, 7th Marines]] (3/7) had to first attack south and capture Hills 1542 and 1419 in order to cover the road from Chinese attacks.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|218}} The breakout was carried out under the air cover of the 1st Marine Air Wing.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|214}}

[[File:Marines engage during the Korean War.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A line of soldiers on a hill engaged in a battle|Marines engaging the Chinese]]
On the morning of 1 December, 3/7 Marines engaged the PVA 175th Regiment of the 59th Division at Hills 1542 ({{Coord|40.435|N|127.107|E|display=inline}}) and 1419 ({{Coord|40.428|N|127.135|E|display=inline}}). The Chinese defenders soon forced the Marines to dig in on the slopes between the road and the peaks&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|220}} when the convoy passed 3/7's position by the afternoon.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|218}} With Hagaru-ri still not captured, the PVA High Command scrambled the 79th Division to resume attacks on Yudam-ni, while the 89th Division rushed south towards Kot'o-ri.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|88}} The Chinese struck at night, and the ferocity of the fighting forced the rear covering forces to call in [[night fighter]]s to suppress the attacks.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|223}} The fighting lasted well into the morning of 2 December until all the Marines had managed to withdraw from Yudam-ni.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|223}}

At the same time, 1/7 Marines also tried to break the Chinese blockade at Hill 1419 on 1 December. Despite being badly reduced by combat, hunger and frostbite, the PVA 59th Division sent in its last five platoons and refused to yield.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|86}} As night approached, 1/7 finally captured the peak and started to march through the hills on the east side of the road.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|233}} Relying on the element of surprise, they managed to destroy several Chinese positions along the road.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|234}} On the morning of 2 December, a joint attack by Fox Company and 1/7 secured the Toktong Pass, thus opening the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|235}}

Although the road had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy still had to fight through the numerous Chinese positions on the hills overlooking the road. On the first night of the retreat, the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties on 3/5 Marines.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|221–3}} Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces for the rest of the march, the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and roadblocks slowed the retreat to a crawl, while inflicting numerous casualties.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|224–5}} Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|239–43}}

[[File:Don C Faith.jpg|thumb|alt=A Caucasian man with brown hair in a military uniform|Lieutenant Colonel Don Carlos Faith, Jr. RCT-31 was later known as &quot;Task Force Faith&quot; due to his leadership]]
RCT-31, later known as &quot;Task Force Faith,&quot; was a hastily formed regimental combat team from the 7th Infantry Division that guarded the right flank of the Marine advance towards Mupyong-ni. Before the battle, RCT-31 was spread thin, with main elements separated on the hills north of Sinhung-ni, the Pyungnyuri Inlet west of Sinhung-ni, and the town of Hudong-ni ({{Coord|40.43|N|127.28|E|display=inline}}) south of Sinhung-ni.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|85}} Although the Chinese believed RCT-31 to be a reinforced [[regiment]],&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|329}} the task force was actually understrength, with one [[battalion]] missing, due to the bulk of the 7th Infantry Division being scattered over northeast Korea.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|85}}

On the night of 27 November, three regiments from the 80th Division attacked the northern hills ({{Coord|40.489|N|127.259|E|display=inline}}) and the inlet,&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|53–4}} completely surprising the defenders.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|89}} The ensuing battle inflicted heavy casualties on the 1st Battalion, [[32d Infantry Regiment (United States)|32nd Infantry]], to the north of Sinhung-ni,&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|93}} while the 57th Field Artillery Battalion and the 3rd Battalion, [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry]], were almost overrun at the Pyungnyuri Inlet.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|97}} The Chinese also sent the 242nd Regiment of the 81st Division towards Hill 1221 ({{Coord|40.449|N|127.268|E|display=inline}}),&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|55}} an undefended hill that controlled the road between Sinhung-ni and Hudong-ni.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|98}} As the night's fighting ended, RCT-31 was separated into three elements.&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|310}}

Believing that the defenders had been completely destroyed at the inlet, the Chinese stopped their attacks and proceeded to loot the US positions for food and clothing.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|58}} As morning came on 28 November, the 3/31st Infantry counterattacked the PVA 239th Regiment at the inlet, sending the surprised Chinese back in a complete rout.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|58}}&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|96}} In the afternoon, Almond flew into the Sinhung-ni perimeter of RCT-31, convinced that RCT-31 was strong enough to begin its attack north and deal with whatever &quot;remnants&quot; of Chinese forces that were in their way. Almond ordered Colonel Allan D. Maclean, the commander of RCT-31, to resume the offensive north while presenting [[Silver Star]]s to three of Maclean's officers. In disgust, Lieutenant Colonel [[Don C. Faith, Jr.]], the commander of the 1/32nd Infantry, threw his medal into the snow.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|102–3}}

[[File:Chinese at Chosin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Soldiers charging into thick smoke|Chinese troops assaulting Task Force Faith's position at Sinhung-ni.]]
On the night of 28 November, the PVA 80th Division attacked again with four regiments.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|59}} At the inlet, the Chinese assault became a disaster as communications broke down, while devastating fire from the [[M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage|M16]] and [[M19 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage|M19]] anti-aircraft (AA) guns attached to the 57th Field Artillery Battalion swept the Chinese ranks.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|59–60}}&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|107}}{{efn|RCT-31's anti-aircraft guns were from D Battery, 15th Antiaircraft Battalion, which was attached to the 57th Field Artillery Battalion during the entire battle.

While RCT-31 was under siege, Almond finally instructed the 1st Marine Division to rescue RCT-31 by breaking out of Yudam-ni, an impossible order for Smith to implement.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|183}} Only the 31st Tank Company tried to rescue RCT-31 by attacking Hill 1221 from Hudong-ni,&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|103}} but without infantry support, the two armored attacks on 28 and 29 November were stalled by slippery roads, rough terrain, and close infantry assaults.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|103–5, 118–9}} By 30 November, the US forces evacuated Hudong-ni in order to defend Hagaru-ri, leaving the rest of RCT-31 completely stranded.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|126}}

On 30 November, Major General [[David G. Barr]], the commander of the 7th Infantry Division, flew into Sinhung-ni and met with Faith, who by now had assumed command of RCT-31. Faith expressed the difficulties for a breakout, particularly the 500 wounded that RCT-31 had to bring along.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|124}} On the same day, parts of the PVA [[94th Division (People's Republic of China)|94th Division]]{{efn|Misidentified as the 90th Division by UN intelligence.

The breakout began as soon as the weather allowed the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing to provide air cover on 1 December.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|132–5}} As the soldiers formed a convoy and tried to leave the Sudong-ni perimeter, the PVA 241st Regiment immediately swarmed over the American forces,&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|137}} with three other regiments closing in.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|64}} Left with no choice, the covering aircraft dropped [[napalm]] right in front of RCT-31, causing casualties among both Chinese and US troops.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|137–138}} The resulting firestorm wiped out the blocking Chinese company,&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|64}} allowing the convoy to advance.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|138}} As the front of RCT-31 made their way forward, heavy small arms fire caused many members of the rear guard to seek shelter below the road instead of protecting the trucks.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|138}} Chinese fire also killed or wounded those already in the trucks as well as the drivers, who viewed the job as a form of suicide.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|139}} Slowly, the convoy approached a roadblock under Hill 1221 in the late afternoon.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|140}} Several parties tried to clear Hill 1221, but after taking part of the hill, the leaderless soldiers continued out onto the frozen reservoir instead of returning to the column.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|144}} As Faith led an assault on the roadblock, he was hit by a Chinese grenade and subsequently died of his wounds.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|146}} The convoy managed to fight past the first roadblock, but as it reached the second at Hudong-ni, RCT-31 disintegrated under Chinese attacks.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|150}} Out of the original 2,500 soldiers, about 1,050 managed to reach Hagaru-ri, and only 385 survivors were deemed able-bodied.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;{{rp|339}} The remnants of RCT-31 were formed into a provisional army battalion for the rest of the battle.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|249}}

=== Actions at Hagaru-ri ===
[[File:Dasc at hagaru ri.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A group of tents surrounded by grass|A [[Direct Air Support Center]] at Hagaru-ri.]]
To support the Marine attack towards Mupyong-ni, Hagaru-ri became an important supply dump with an airfield under construction. Smith and 1st Marine Division headquarters were also located at Hagaru-ri.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|72}} With the bulk of the 1st Marine Division gathered at Yudam-ni, Hagaru-ri was lightly defended by two battalions from the 1st and 7th Marines, the rest of the garrison being composed of engineers and rear support units from both the Army and the Marine Corps.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;{{rp|322}}

The original Chinese plan called for the 58th Division to attack Hagaru-ri on the night of 27 November, but the division became lost in the countryside due to the outdated Japanese maps it used.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|74}} It was not until the dawn of 28 November that the 58th Division arrived at Hagaru-ri.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|74}} Meanwhile, from the fighting and ambushes that had occurred the previous night, the garrison at Hagaru-ri noticed the Chinese forces around them. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas L. Ridge, commander of [[3rd Battalion, 1st Marines]] (3/1), predicted the Chinese attack would come on the night of 28 November.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|162}} Almost everyone, including rear support units with little combat training, was pressed into service on the front line due to the manpower shortage,&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|174}} and the entire perimeter was on full alert by 21:30.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|163}}

It was not long before the PVA 173rd Regiment attacked the western and the southern perimeter, while the 172nd Regiment struck the hills on the northern perimeter.&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|317}} Despite the preparations, the understrength garrison was overwhelmed, with the Chinese opening several gaps in the defenses and reaching the rear areas.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|165}} The resulting chaos, however, caused a breakdown in discipline among the Chinese soldiers, who began looting food and clothing instead of exploiting the situation.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;{{rp|324}} The defending Americans managed to destroy the Chinese forces in counterattacks, while a breakdown of communications between the Chinese regiments allowed the gaps to close.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|174}} When the fighting stopped, the Chinese had only gained the East Hill ({{Coord|40.387|N|127.259|E|display=inline}}) on the northern perimeter.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|174}} Another attack was planned for the night of 29 November, but air raids by [[VMA-542|VMF-542]] broke up the Chinese formations before it could be carried out.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|195}}

Given the critical manpower shortage at Hagaru-ri, on November 29, Smith ordered Colonel [[Chesty Puller|Lewis &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller]] of the [[First Marine Regiment]] to assemble a task force to be sent north from Kot'o-ri to open the road south of Hagaru-ri.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|186}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hickman|first1=Kennedy|title=Korean War: Battle of Chosin Reservoir|url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/battleswars1900s/p/chosin.htm|publisher=Military History About.com|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A task force was formed with 921 troops from [[41 Commando|41 Royal Marines Commando]], G Company of the 1st Marines and B Company of the 31st Infantry.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|187}}{{sfn|Montross|Canzona|1992|pp=228, 234}} It was dubbed &quot;Task Force Drysdale&quot; after its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Douglas B.

As more reinforcements arrived from Hudong-ni on 30 November,&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|204}} the garrisons attempted to recapture the East Hill. All efforts failed, despite the destruction of a Chinese company.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|80}}&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|203}} When darkness settled, the PVA 58th Division gathered its remaining 1,500 soldiers in a last-ditch attempt to capture Hagaru-ri.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|81}} The reinforced defenders annihilated most of the attacking forces, with only the defences around the East Hill giving way.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|205}} As the Chinese tried to advance from the East Hill, they were cut down by the 31st Tank Company.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|206}}

=== Breakout ===
[[File:Chosin-Retreat.png|thumb|left|alt=A map showing the withdrawal of a military force south along a river|Map of the Retreat from the Changjin (Chosin) Reservoir]]
After a short rest, the breakout began on 6 December, with the 7th Marines as the vanguard of the retreating column, while the 5th Marines covered the rear.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|247}} At the same time, the much-delayed PVA 26th Corps arrived at Hagaru-ri with its [[76th Division (People's Republic of China)|76th]] and [[77th Division (People's Republic of China)|77th Divisions]] to relieve the 58th and 60th Divisions.&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|379}} As the 7th Marines pushed aside the PVA 76th Division south of Hagaru-ri, the 5th Marines took over the Hagaru-ri perimeter and recaptured the East Hill from the 76th Division.&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|382}}&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|260}} In a last effort to stop the breakout,&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|382}} the customary Chinese night attack was launched, with the 76th and 77th Division striking the Hagaru-ri perimeter from all directions.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|97}} The Marines repulsed the attacks, inflicting heavy casualties.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|262}}

Meanwhile, the 7th Marines opened the road between Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri by capturing the high ground surrounding the road.

The PVA 9th Army suffered 19,202 combat casualties, and 28,954 non-combat casualties were attributed to the harsh Korean winter and lack of food.

During the battle, UN dead were buried at temporary grave sites along the road. [[Operation Glory]] took place from July to November 1954, during which the dead of each side were exchanged.

===Outcome assessment===
Roy E. Appleman, the author of US Army official history ''South to Naktong, North to Yalu'', writes that both sides could claim victory: the PVA 9th Army ultimately held the battlefield, while X Corps held off the PVA 9th Army in a series of battles that enabled it to withdraw most of its forces as an effective tactical unit.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|355–6}}  [[Allan R. Millett]] qualifies a Chinese &quot;geographic victory&quot; that ejected X Corps from North Korea with the fact that the Chinese failed to achieve the objective of destroying the 1st Marine Division, adding that the campaign gave the UN confidence that it could withstand the superior numbers of the Chinese forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-the-Chosin-Reservoir |title=Battle of the Chosin Reservoir |last=Millett |first=Allan R. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date= 3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Chinese history, published by [[PLA Academy of Military Science]], states that despite the heavy casualties, the PVA 9th Army had earned its victory by successfully protecting the eastern flank of Chinese forces in Korea, while inflicting over 10,000 casualties to the UN forces.{{sfn|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=126}}

[[Eliot A. Cohen]] writes that the retreat from Chosin was a UN victory which inflicted such heavy losses on the PVA 9th Army that it was put out of action until March 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Paul M. Edwards, founder of the Center for the Study of the Korean War,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreanwar-educator.org/topics/center_for_study/center_for_study.htm |title=The Center for the Study of the Korean War |publisher=The Center for the Study of the Korean War |access-date= 3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; draws parallels between the battle at Chosin and the [[Dunkirk evacuation]]. He writes that the retreat from Chosin following a &quot;massive strategic victory&quot; by the Chinese has been represented as &quot;a moment of heroic history&quot; for the UN forces.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2018 p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Appleman, on the other hand, questioned the necessity of a sea-borne evacuation to preserve the UN forces, asserting that  X Corps had the strength to break out of the Chinese encirclement at Hungnam at the end of the battle.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|371–2}} Chinese historian Li Xiaobing acknowledges X Corps' successful withdrawal from North Korea, and writes that the Battle of Chosin &quot;has become a part of Marine lore, but it was still a retreat, not a victory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Xiaobing Li (2014), ''China's Battle for Korea: The 1951 Spring Offensive,'', Bloomington: Indiana University Press, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Cumings]] simply refers to the battle as a &quot;terrible defeat&quot; for the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Cumings p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick C. Roe, who served as an intelligence officer with the 7th Marine Regiment at Chosin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/the-dragon-strikes-by-patrick-c-roe-mh-book-review.htm |title=The Dragon Strikes (by Patrick C. Roe) : MH: Book Review |last=Hull |first=Michael D. |date=August 12, 2001 |publisher=Historynet |access-date= September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that X Corps directly allowed the Eighth Army to hold the south{{efn|&quot;Loss of the 1st Marine Division would have resulted in the loss of a substantial portion of X Corps. Instead, X Corps was withdrawn intact, while inflicting such damage upon the twelve divisions of the 9th Army that they were out of action until the last days of March. With the reinforcement by X Corps, and with the absence of nearly 40% of total Chinese strength, the Eighth Army was able to hold the south.&quot; See {{harvnb|Roe|2000|pp=411–2}}}} and quoted MacArthur in corroborating his view.{{efn|&quot;General MacArthur agreed that this was the decisive battle. In commenting on a study by the Marine Corps Board, he wrote: &quot;The Marine Corps Board of Study rightfully points out that the campaign of the 1st Marine Division with attached Army elements in North Korea was 'largely responsible for preventing reinforcement of CCF forces on Eighth Army front by 12 divisions during a period when such reinforcement might have meant to Eighth Army the difference between maintaining a foothold in Korea or forced evacuation therefrom.'...&quot;&quot;See {{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=412}}}} Yu Bin, a historian and a former member of the [[Chinese People's Liberation Army]], states that while the destruction of Task Force Faith{{efn|Yu Bin states that it was the 32nd Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division that was destroyed, reflecting the Chinese mis-identification of the composition of Task Force Faith.&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|329}}}} was viewed as the single greatest Chinese victory of the war, ultimately the PVA 9th Army had become &quot;a giant hospital&quot; while failing to destroy the numerically inferior UN forces at Chosin as planned.{{sfn|Ryan|Finkelstein|McDevitt|2003|p=130}} [[Zhang Renchu]], whose 26th Corps was blamed for allowing the X Corps to escape,{{sfn|Xue &amp; Li Part Four|2000}} had threatened suicide over the outcome, while Song Shilun offered to resign his post.{{sfn|Spurr|1988|p=266}}

The battle exacerbated inter-service hostility, the Marines blaming the US Army and its leadership for the failure.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2006 p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2018 p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of the army units fighting on the east of the reservoir was regarded as shameful, and for many years afterwards their role in the battle was largely ignored. Later studies concluded that Task Force MacLean/Faith had held off for five days a significantly larger force than previously thought and that their stand was a significant factor in the Marines' survival. This was eventually recognized in September 1999 when, for its actions at Chosin, Task Force Faith was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation, an award that General Smith blocked when it was first proposed in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://armyhistory.org/nightmare-at-the-chosin-reservoir/ |title=Nightmare at the Chosin Reservoir |last=Seelinger |first=Matthew J. |date=January 20, 2015 |publisher=Army Historical Foundation |access-date= 3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2000/12/11/50-years-later-an-army-force-gets-its-due/7a49d39b-0c39-4242-b062-a89a57add4f6/ |title=50 Years Later, an Army Force Gets Its Due |last=Vogel |first=Steve |date=December 11, 2000 |newspaper=Washington Post |access-date= 3 July 2018|quote=But a number of historians and some Marine veterans of Chosin now believe that the 1st Marine Division might have been destroyed had the poorly armed, ill-trained soldiers of Task Force Faith not bought time by keeping the Chinese from sweeping south.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marines evacuated from North Korea spent January and most of February 1951 rebuilding in the relatively secure South Korea, where they destroyed the well-respected but already weakened North Korean [[10th Division (North Korea)|10th Division]] in [[counter-guerrilla]] operations during the [[First and Second Battles of Wonju#Anti-guerrilla operations|Second Battle of Wonju]].&lt;ref name=Mossman/&gt;{{rp|227}}&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2001) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The Marines returned to regular and heavy action on February 21 in [[Operation Killer]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2001) pp. 20–23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider effect on the war===
The battle ended the UN force's expectation of total victory, including the capture of North Korea and the reunification of the peninsula.&lt;ref name=Stewartp33&gt;Stewart p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1950, PVA/KPA forces had recaptured North Korea and pushed UN forces back south of the 38th parallel. Serious consideration was given to the evacuation of all US forces from the Korean peninsula and US military leaders made secret contingency plans to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2001) pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The disregard by [[Far East Command (United States)|Far Eastern Command]] under MacArthur of the initial warnings and diplomatic hints by the PVA almost led the entire UN army to disaster at Ch'ongch'on River and Chosin Reservoir and only after the formation and stabilization of a coherent UN defensive line under Lieutenant General [[Matthew Ridgway]] did the &quot;period of headlong retreats from an attacking, unsuspected foe&quot; cease.&lt;ref name=Stewartp33 /&gt;

On the other hand, the battle affected the PVA in two ways, both of which had the result of helping the UN Command to secure its position in South Korea, while losing North Korea. First, according to historian Shu Guang Zhang, PVA commanders were persuaded by their victories at Chosin and Ch'ongch'on that they could &quot;defeat American armed forces&quot;, and this led to &quot;unrealistic expectations that the CPV [PVA] would work miracles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shu Guang Zhang (1995), ''Mao's Military Romanticism: China and the Korean War, 1950-1953,'' Manhattan: University Press of Kansas, pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Halberstam/&gt;{{rp|624–5}} Second, the heavy casualties caused by sub-zero temperatures and combat, plus poor logistical support weakened the PVA's eight elite divisions of the 20th and 27th Corps. Of those eight divisions, two were forced to disband,&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|114}} With the absence of 12 out of 30 of Chinese divisions in Korea in early 1951, Roe says that the heavy Chinese losses at Chosin enabled the UN forces to maintain a foothold in Korea.&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|412}}

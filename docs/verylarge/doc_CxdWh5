=== Pure mathematics and statistics ===
In [[pure mathematics]], Poisson's most important works were his series of memoirs on [[definite integral]]s and his discussion of [[Fourier series]], the latter paving the way for the classic researches of [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]] on the same subject; these are to be found in the ''Journal'' of the École Polytechnique from 1813 to 1823, and in the ''Memoirs de l'Académie'' for 1823. He also studied [[Fourier integral]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; 

Poisson wrote an essay on the [[calculus of variations]] (''Mem. de l'acad.,'' 1833), and memoirs on the probability of the mean results of observations (''Connaiss. d. temps,'' 1827, &amp;c). The [[Poisson distribution]] in [[probability theory]] is named after him.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

In 1820 Poisson studied integrations along paths in the complex plane, becoming the first person to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1972|isbn=0-19-506136-5|location=|pages=633|chapter=27.4: The Foundation of Complex Function Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1829, Poisson published a paper on elastic bodies that contained a statement and proof of a special case of what became known as the [[divergence theorem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Victor|date=May 1979|title=A History of Stokes' Theorem|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2690275|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=52|issue=3|pages=146-156|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Analytical mechanics and the calculus of variations ====
Founded mainly by Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange in the eighteenth century, the [[calculus of variations]] saw further development and applications in the nineteenth.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1972|isbn=0-19-506136-5|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 30: The Calculus of Variations in the Nineteenth Century}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Let&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;S = \int\limits_{a}^{b} f (x, y(x), y'(x)) \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;where &lt;math&gt;y' = \frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is extremized if it satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equations&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} - \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y'} \right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;But if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; depends on higher-order derivatives of &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, if &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;S = \int\limits_{a}^{b} f \left(x, y(x), y'(x), ..., y^{(n)}(x) \right) \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;then &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy the Euler–Poisson equation,&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} - \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y'} \right) + ... + (-1)^{n} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} \left[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y^{(n)}} \right]= 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kot|first=Mark|title=A First Course in the Calculus of Variations|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4704-1495-5|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 4: Basic Generalizations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Poisson's [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000387664 ''Traité de mécanique''] (2 vols. 8vo, 1811 and 1833) was written in the style of Laplace and Lagrange and was long a standard work.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; 

Let &lt;math&gt; q&lt;/math&gt; be the position, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be the kinetic energy, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; the potential energy, both independent of time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Lagrange's equation of motion reads&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial T}{\partial q_i} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial q_i} = 0, ~~~~ i = 1, 2, ... , n.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here, the dot notation for the time derivative is used, &lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt} = \dot{q}&lt;/math&gt;. Poisson set &lt;math&gt;L = T - V&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; He argued that if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i&lt;/math&gt;, he could write&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_i},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;giving&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left (\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He introduced an explicit formula for [[momentum|momenta]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt; p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_i}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, from the equation of motion, he got&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt; \dot{p}_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Poisson's text influenced the work of [[William Rowan Hamilton]] and [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]]. A translation of Poisson's [https://books.google.com/books?id=lksn7QwUZsQC&amp;dq=Poisson+mechanics&amp;as_brr=1&amp;hl=en Treatise on Mechanics] was published in London in 1842. Let &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; be functions of the canonical variables of motion &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Then their [[Poisson bracket]] is given by&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;[u, v] = \frac{\partial u}{\partial q_i} \frac{\partial v}{\partial p_i} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial p_i} \frac{\partial v}{\partial q_i}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Herbert|title=Classical Mechanics|title-link=Classical Mechanics (Goldstein book)|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company|year=1980|isbn=0-201-02918-9|location=|pages=397, 399, 406-7|chapter=Chapter 9: Canonical Transformations|author-link=Herbert Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Evidently, the operation anti-commutes. More precisely, &lt;math&gt;[u, v] = -[v, u]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; By [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations of motion]], the total time derivative of &lt;math&gt;u = u (q, p, t)&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{du}{dt} &amp;= \frac{\partial u}{\partial q_i} \dot{q}_i + \frac{\partial u}{\partial p_i} \dot{p}_i + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac{\partial u}{\partial q_i} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial p_i} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \\[6pt]
&amp;= [u, H] + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the Hamiltonian. In terms of Poisson brackets, then, Hamilton's equations can be written as &lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i = [q_i, H]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{p}_i = [p_i, H]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Suppose &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a [[constant of motion]], then it must satisfy&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;[H, u] = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Moreover, Poisson's theorem states the Poisson bracket of any two constants of motion is also a constant of motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In September 1925, [[Paul Dirac]] received proofs of a seminal paper by [[Werner Heisenberg]] on the new branch of physics known as [[quantum mechanics]]. Soon he realized that the key idea in Heisenberg's paper was the anti-commutativity of dynamical variables and remembered that the analogous mathematical construction in classical mechanics was Poisson brackets. He found the treatment he needed in [[E. T. Whittaker]]'s ''[[Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Farmelo|first=Graham|title=The Strangest Man: the Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Mystic of the Atom|publisher=Basic Books|year=2009|isbn=978-0-465-02210-6|location=Great Britain|pages=83–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coutinho12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coutinho|first=S.

Poisson also published a memoir on the theory of waves (Mém. ft. l'acad., 1825).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

==== Continuum mechanics and fluid flow ====
{{unsolved|physics|Under what conditions do [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness|solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations exist and are smooth]]? This is a [[Millennium Prize Problems|Millennium Prize Problem]] in mathematics.}}
In 1821, using an analogy with elastic bodies, [[Claude-Louis Navier]] arrived at the basic equations of motion for viscous fluids, now identified as the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. In 1829 Poisson independently obtained the same result. [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]] re-derived them in 1845 using continuum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1972|isbn=0-19-506136-5|location=United States of America|pages=696-7|chapter=28.7: Systems of Partial Differential Equations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poisson, [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], and [[Sophie Germain|Sophie Germaine]] were the main contributors to the theory of elasticity in the nineteenth century. The calculus of variations was frequently used to solve problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Thermodynamics ===
In his work on heat conduction, Joseph Fourier maintained that the arbitrary function may be represented as an infinite trigonometric series and made explicit the possibility of expanding functions in terms of [[Bessel function]]s and [[Legendre polynomials]], depending on the context of the problem. It took some time for his ideas to be accepted as his use of mathematics was less than rigorous. Although initially skeptical, Poisson adopted Fourier's method. From around 1815 he studied various problems in heat conduction. He published his [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001988678 ''Théorie mathématique de la chaleur''] in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1972|isbn=0-19-506136-5|location=United States of America|pages=678-9|chapter=28.2: The Heat Equation and Fourier Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1800s, Pierre-Simon de Laplace developed a sophisticated, if speculative, description of gases based on the old caloric theory of heat, to which younger scientists such as Poisson were less committed. A success for Laplace was his correction of Newton's formula for the speed of sound in air that gives satisfactory answers when compared with experiments. The [[Speed of sound#Speed of sound in ideal gases and air|Newton–Laplace formula]] makes use of the specific heats of gases at constant volume &lt;math&gt;c_V&lt;/math&gt;and at constant pressure &lt;math&gt;c_P&lt;/math&gt;. In 1823 Poisson redid his teacher's work and reached the same results without resorting to complex hypotheses previously employed by Laplace. In addition, by using the gas laws of [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]], Poisson obtained the equation for gases undergoing [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic changes]], namely &lt;math&gt;PV^{\gamma} = \text{constant}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure of the gas, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; its volume, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{c_P}{c_V}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lewis|first=Christopher|title=Heat and Thermodynamics: A Historical Perspective|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33332-3|location=United States of America|pages=|chapter=Chapter 2: The Rise and Fall of the Caloric Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other works ===
[[File:Poisson - Mémoire sur le calcul numerique des integrales définies, 1826 - 744791.tif|thumb|''Mémoire sur le calcul numerique des integrales définies'', 1826]]Besides his many memoirs, Poisson published a number of treatises, most of which were intended to form part of a great work on mathematical physics, which he did not live to complete.

== Interaction with Évariste Galois ==
{{See also|Galois theory}}
After political activist [[Évariste Galois]] had returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the École Normale, Poisson asked him to submit his work on the [[theory of equations]], which he did January 1831. In early July, Poisson declared Galois' work &quot;incomprehensible,&quot; but encouraged Galois to &quot;publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taton|first=R.|year=1947|title=Les relations d'Évariste Galois avec les mathématiciens de son temps|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/rhs_0048-7996_1947_num_1_2_2607|journal=Revue d'Histoire des Sciences et de Leurs Applications|volume=1|issue=2|pages=114–130|doi=10.3406/rhs.1947.2607}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Poisson's report was made before Galois' July 14 arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois vehemently decided against publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Yet Galois did not ignore Poisson's advice. He began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on&amp;nbsp;April 29 1832,&lt;ref name=&quot;dupuy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dupuy|first=Paul|year=1896|title=La vie d'Évariste Galois|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Livre:Dupuy_-_La_vie_d'%C3%89variste_Galois.djvu|journal=Annales de l'École Normale|volume=13|pages=197–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he was somehow persuaded to participate in what was to be a fatal duel.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=C.|first=Bruno, Leonard|url=https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=2003|isbn=978-0787638139|location=Detroit, Mich.|page=[https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/173 173]|oclc=41497065|origyear=1999|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mothman Prophecies''''' is a 1975 book by [[John Keel]].&lt;ref&gt;Keel, J. 1975. ''The Mothman Prophecies''. New York: Saturday Review Press and E. P. Dutton. 269 pp. {{ISBN|0-8415-0355-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book relates Keel's accounts of his investigation into alleged sightings of a large, winged creature called [[Mothman]] in the vicinity of [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]], during 1966 and 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=E.L.|last=North|date=1979|chapter=Mysteries in the Mountains and Skies of West Virginia|pages=190–196|title=Redcoats, Redskins, and Red-Eyed Monsters|location=New York City|publisher=[[A. S. Barnes and Company]]|isbn=0-498-02085-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It combines these accounts with his theories about [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s and various [[supernatural]] phenomena, ultimately connecting them to the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]] across the [[Ohio River]] on December 15, 1967. Official investigations in 1971 determined it was caused by [[stress corrosion cracking]] in an [[eyebar]] in a suspension chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=cJ1eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MVMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4537,3056163|newspaper=[[The Portsmouth Times]]|date=28 May 1976|page=12|title=Claims In Disaster Denied}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Limpopo River''' rises in [[South Africa]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EBLimpopo&quot;&gt;{{citation |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=Limpopo River |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Limpopo-River |access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and flows generally eastwards through [[Mozambique]] to the [[Indian Ocean]]. The term Limpopo is derived from Rivombo (Livombo/Lebombo), a group of Tsonga settlers led by Hosi Rivombo who settled in the mountainous vicinity and named the area after their leader. The river is approximately {{convert|1750|km|mi|0}} long, with a [[drainage basin]] {{convert|415000|km2|sqmi|-2}} in size. The mean [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] measured over a year is 170 [[Cubic metre per second|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s]] (6,200 [[Cubic foot per second|cu&amp;nbsp;ft/s]]) at its mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nakayama |first= Mikiyasu |title= International Waters in Southern Africa |year=2003 |publisher=United Nations University Press |isbn=92-808-1077-4 |pages=9}}; online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ittv1oAJ37sC Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The Limpopo is the second largest [[river]] in [[Africa]] that drains to the Indian Ocean, after the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The first European to sight the river was [[Vasco da Gama]], who anchored off its mouth in 1498 and named it Espirito Santo River. Its lower course was explored by [[St Vincent Whitshed Erskine]] in 1868–69, and Captain J F Elton travelled down its middle course in 1870.

The drainage area of Limpopo River has decreased over [[deep time|geological time]]. Up to [[Piacenzian|Late Pliocene]] or [[Pleistocene]] times, the upper course of the Zambezi River drained into the Limpopo River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goudie |first1=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |date=2005 |title=The drainage of Africa since the Cretaceous |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=67 |issue= |pages=437–456 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change of the [[drainage divide]] is the result of [[epeirogenic movement]] that uplifted the surface north of present-day Limpopo River diverting waters into Zambezi River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=A.E. |date=1999 |title=A reapprisal of epeirogenic flexure axes in southern Africa |url= |journal=[[South African Journal of Geology]] |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=363–376 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The river flows in a great arc, first zigzagging north and then north-east, then turning east and finally south-east. It serves as a border for about {{convert|640|km|mi|0}}, separating [[South Africa]] to the southeast from [[Botswana]] to the northwest and [[Zimbabwe]] to the north. Two of its tributaries, the [[Marico River]] and the [[Crocodile River (Limpopo)|Crocodile River]] join, at which point the name changes to Limpopo River. There are several [[rapids]] as the river falls off [[Southern Africa]]'s inland [[escarpment]].

The [[Notwane River]] is a major tributary of the Limpopo, rising on the edge of the [[Kalahari Desert]] in Botswana and flowing in a north-easterly direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugr.es/~natalie/mladenov/mladenov_notwane.pdf The Notwane River, Botswana]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main tributary of the Limpopo, the [[Olifants River (Limpopo)|Olifants River]] (Elephant River), contributes around 1,233 million&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water per year.&lt;ref name=Boroto&gt;Görgens, A.H.M. and Boroto, R.A. 1997.

In: Proceedings of the 8th South African National Hydrology Symposium, Pretoria, South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major tributaries include the [[Shashe River]], [[Mzingwane River]], [[Crocodile River (Limpopo)|Crocodile River]], [[Mwenezi River]] and [[Luvuvhu River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/y5744e/y5744e07.htm|title=Drought impact mitigation and prevention in the Limpopo River Basin|author=|date=|website=www.fao.org|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north-eastern corner of South Africa the river borders the [[Kruger National Park]].

The port town of [[Xai-Xai]], [[Mozambique]] is on the river near the mouth. Below the Olifants, the river is permanently [[navigable]] to the sea, though a [[Bar (landform)|sandbar]] prevents access by large ships except at high tide.

[[File:GreasyLimpopo.jpg|thumb|right|Sign at the viewing deck of the Limpopo River at Mapungubwe National Park, South Africa, featuring a quote from Rudyard Kipling]]
The waters of the Limpopo flow sluggishly, with considerable silt content. [[Rudyard Kipling|Rudyard Kipling's]] characterization of the river as the &quot;great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with [[Acacia xanthophloea|fever-trees]],&quot; where the &quot;[[African Rock Python|Bi-Coloured Python Rock-Snake]]&quot; dwells&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_elephantschild1.htm The Elephant's Child, Rudyard Kipling]&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[Just So Stories]]'' is apt. [[Rainfall]] is seasonal and unreliable: in dry years, the upper parts of the river flow for 40 days or less. The upper part of the drainage basin, in the [[Kalahari]] Desert, is arid but conditions become less arid further downriver. The next reaches drain the [[Waterberg Massif]], a [[biome]] of semi-[[deciduous forest]] and low-density human population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogan&quot;&gt;C.Michael Hogan, Mark L. Cooke and Helen Murray, ''The Waterberg Biosphere'', Lumina Technologies, May 22, 2006. {{cite web|url=http://www.luminatechnologies.org/lumaw.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324191043/http://www.luminatechnologies.org/lumaw.html |archivedate=2007-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 14 million people live in the Limpopo basin. The fertile lowlands support a denser population. Flooding during the rainy season is an occasional problem in the lower reaches. During February 2000 heavy rainfalls (due to a cyclone) caused the catastrophic [[2000 Mozambique flood]].

The highest concentration of [[hippopotamus]] in the Limpopo River is found between the [[Mokolo River|Mokolo]] and the [[Mogalakwena River]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwaf.gov.za/iwqs/rhp/state_of_rivers/limpopo/mokolo_06.pdf State of Rivers Report: the Mokolo River]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of [[mining]] activity in the Limpopo River basin with about 1,900 mines, not counting about 1,700 abandoned mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limpoporak.org/en/management/water+demand/mining+and+industry/in+the+basin.aspx?print=1|title=Mines in the Limpopo River basin|website=limpoporak.org|accessdate=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064223/http://www.limpoporak.org/en/management/water+demand/mining+and+industry/in+the+basin.aspx?print=1|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Vasco da Gama]] on his first expedition, was probably among the first Europeans to sight the river, when he anchored off the mouth in 1498. However, there has been human habitation in the region since time immemorial&amp;nbsp;— sites in the Makapans Valley near [[Mokopane]] contain [[Australopithecus]] fossils from 3.5 million years ago. [[St Vincent Whitshed Erskine]], later Surveyor General for South Africa, traveled to the mouth of the river in 1868-69.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erskine|first=Vincent W.|date=1869|title=Journey of Exploration to the Mouth of the River Limpopo|jstor=1798552|journal=The Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London|volume=39|pages=233–276|doi=10.2307/1798552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Zambezi shark]] (''Carcharhinus leucas'') was caught hundreds of kilometres upriver at the confluence of the Limpopo and [[Luvuvhu River]]s in July 1950. Zambezi sharks tolerate fresh water and can travel far up the Limpopo.&lt;ref&gt;Pienaar, U. de V., ''The Freshwater Fishes of the [[Kruger National Park]]'', Koedoe Vol 11, No 1 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, approximately 15,000 [[Nile crocodile]]s were released into the river from flood gates at the nearby Rakwena Crocodile Farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/25/us-safrica-crocodiles-idUSBRE90N0OT20130125|title=South Africa police join hunt for 10,000 escaped crocodiles|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|date=|website=reuters.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is South Africa's largest urban centre north of [[Gauteng]]. Polokwane was one of the host cities of the official tournament of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

==History==
In the 1840s, [[Voortrekker]]s under the leadership of [[Andries Potgieter]] established Zoutpansbergdorp, a town {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the northwest. This settlement had to be abandoned because of clashes with the local tribes. They founded a new town in 1886 and named it &quot;Pietersburg&quot; in honour of Voortrekker leader [[Petrus Jacobus Joubert]]. The [[British Empire|British]] built a [[British concentration camps|concentration camp]] at Pietersburg during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] to incarcerate almost 4,000 [[Boer]] women and children. The town officially became a city on 23 April 1992; on 25 February 2005, the government declared the official name of the city as Polokwane, a name that was generally in use by the speakers of [[Northern Sotho language|Northern Sotho]]. The city was host to 52nd national conference of the [[African National Congress]], held in December 2007 and saw [[Jacob Zuma]] voted as President of the ANC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 December 2007 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/10328276 |title=South Africa: Zuma comes out on top |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/52nd-anc-national-conference-polokwane-2007|title=The 52nd ANC National Conference - Polokwane 2007 {{!}} South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za|access-date=2019-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

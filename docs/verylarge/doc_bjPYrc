Most participants do not run a marathon to win. More important for most runners is their personal finishing time and their placement within their specific gender and age group, though some runners just want to finish. Strategies for completing a marathon include running the whole distance&lt;ref name=higdon/&gt; and a runâ€“walk strategy.&lt;ref name=galloway /&gt; In 2005, the average marathon time in the U.S. was 4 hours 32 minutes 8 seconds for men, 5 hours 6 minutes 8 seconds for women.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the men's and women's median marathon times were 4 hours 20 minutes 13 seconds and 4 hours 45 minutes 30 seconds respectively.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A goal many runners aim for is to break certain time barriers. For example, recreational first-timers often try to run the marathon under four hours; more competitive runners may attempt to finish under three hours.&lt;ref name=Magee&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutrunning.net/sri-chinmoy-racesblog/running-sub-3-hour-marathon |title=Running a sub 3-hour marathon |publisher=allaboutrunning.net |accessdate=22 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215181724/http://www.allaboutrunning.net/sri-chinmoy-racesblog/running-sub-3-hour-marathon |archivedate=15 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other benchmarks are the qualifying times for major marathons. The [[Boston Marathon]], the oldest marathon in the United States, requires a qualifying time for all non-professional runners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonmarathon.org/BostonMarathon/Qualifying.asp |title=Boston Athletic Association |publisher=Bostonmarathon.org |accessdate=22 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608141549/http://www.bostonmarathon.org/BostonMarathon/Qualifying.asp |archive-date=8 June 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York City Marathon]] also requires a qualifying time for guaranteed entry, at a significantly faster pace than Boston's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcsnycmarathon.org/run-in-2017|title=Run in 2017|date=7 September 2016|website=TCS New York City Marathon|accessdate=7 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503130030/https://www.tcsnycmarathon.org/run-in-2017|archive-date=3 May 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, there is a maximum allowed time of about six hours after which the marathon route is closed, although some larger marathons keep the course open considerably longer (eight hours or more). Many marathons around the world have such time limits by which all runners must have crossed the finish line. Anyone slower than the limit will be picked up by a sweeper bus. In many cases the marathon organizers are required to reopen the roads to the public so that traffic can return to normal.

With the growth in popularity of marathon-running, many marathons across the United States and the world have been filling to capacity faster than ever before. When the Boston Marathon opened up registration for its 2011 running, the field capacity was filled within eight hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boston.com/sports/marathon/articles/2010/10/19/marathon_fills_its_field_in_a_record_8_hours/?page=2 Online, sprinters win race: Marathon fills its field in a record 8 hours] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022030447/http://www.boston.com/sports/marathon/articles/2010/10/19/marathon_fills_its_field_in_a_record_8_hours/?page=2 |date=22 October 2010 }}.

More experienced marathoners may run a longer distance during the week. Greater weekly training mileages can offer greater results in terms of distance and endurance, but also carry a greater risk of training injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;daniels&quot; /&gt; Most male elite marathon runners will have weekly mileages of over {{convert|160|km|abbr=on|-1}}.&lt;ref name=daniels&gt;{{Cite book| author=Daniels, J. | title=Daniels' Running Formula, 2nd Ed. |publisher=Human Kinetics Publishing | year=2005 | isbn=0-7360-5492-8}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended that those new to running should get a checkup from their doctor, as there are certain warning signs and risk factors that should be evaluated before undertaking any new workout program, especially marathon training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rush.edu/health-wellness/discover-health/marathon-training-tips |title=Marathon Training Tips |publisher=Rush University Medical Center |accessdate=24 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702002552/https://www.rush.edu/health-wellness/discover-health/marathon-training-tips |archive-date=2 July 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many training programs last a minimum of five or six months, with a gradual increase in the distance run and finally, for recovery, a period of [[tapering]] in the one to three weeks preceding the race. For beginners wishing to merely finish a marathon, a minimum of four months of running four days a week is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Whitsett ''et al.'' (1998) The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer.

The last long training run might be undertaken up to two weeks prior to the event. Many marathon runners also [[carbohydrate loading|&quot;carbo-load&quot;]] (increase carbohydrate intake while holding total caloric intake constant) during the week before the marathon to allow their bodies to store more [[glycogen]].

=== Glycogen and &quot;the wall&quot; ===
{{Main|Hitting the wall}}
[[Carbohydrate]]s that a person eats are converted by the [[liver]] and [[muscle]]s into [[glycogen]] for storage. Glycogen burns rapidly to provide quick energy. Runners can store about 8 [[joule|MJ]] or 2,000 [[calorie|kcal]] worth of glycogen in their bodies, enough for about 30&amp;nbsp;km/18â€“20 miles of running. Many runners report that running becomes noticeably more difficult at that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.half-marathon-running.com/HittingTheWall |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322111711/http://www.half-marathon-running.com/HittingTheWall |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 March 2017 |title=Hitting the wall for marathon runners |publisher=Half-marathon-running.com |accessdate=22 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When glycogen runs low, the body must then obtain energy by burning stored fat, which does not burn as readily. When this happens, the runner will experience dramatic [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] and is said to &quot;[[hitting the wall|hit the wall]]&quot;. The aim of training for the marathon, according to many coaches,&lt;ref name=glyco&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e-articles.info/e/a/title/Lesser-Known-Dangers-Associated-With-Marathons/ |title=Lesser-known Dangers Associated with Running a Marathon |last=Klein |first=Michael |date=3 October 2008 |work=E-articles.info |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117044405/http://e-articles.info/e/a/title/Lesser-Known-Dangers-Associated-With-Marathons/ |archivedate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to maximize the limited glycogen available so that the fatigue of the &quot;wall&quot; is not as dramatic. This is accomplished in part by utilizing a higher percentage of energy from burned fat even during the early phase of the race, thus conserving glycogen.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Carbohydrate-based &quot;[[energy gel]]s&quot; are used by runners to avoid or reduce the effect of &quot;hitting the wall&quot;, as they provide easy to digest energy during the run. Energy gels usually contain varying amounts of sodium and potassium and some also contain caffeine. They need to be consumed with a certain amount of water. Recommendations for how often to take an energy gel during the race range widely.&lt;ref name=glyco /&gt;

[[File:Boston marathon mile 25 helper 050418.jpg|thumb|A runner getting encouragement at Mile 25 of the Boston Marathon]]
Alternatives to gels include various forms of concentrated sugars, and foods high in simple carbohydrates that can be digested easily. Many runners experiment with consuming energy supplements during training runs to determine what works best for them. Consumption of food while running sometimes makes the runner sick. Runners are advised not to ingest a new food or medicine just prior to or during a race.&lt;ref name=glyco /&gt; It is also important to refrain from taking any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory class of pain relievers ([[NSAIDs]], e.g., [[aspirin]], [[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen]]), as these drugs may change the way the kidneys regulate their blood flow and may lead to serious kidney problems, especially in cases involving moderate to severe dehydration. NSAIDS block the [[COX-2]] enzyme pathway to prevent the production of prostaglandins. These prostaglandins may act as inflammation factors throughout the body, but they also play a crucial role in maintenance of water retention. In less than 5% of the whole population that take NSAIDS, individuals may be more negatively sensitive to renal prostaglandin synthesis inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brater|first=D.

===Temperature===

A study of the performance of 1.8 million participants in the Berlin, London, Paris, Boston, Chicago, and New York marathons during the years from 2001 to 2010 found that runners recorded their fastest times when the temperature was around 6&amp;nbsp;Â°C (43&amp;nbsp;Â°F), with every increase of 10&amp;nbsp;Â°C (18&amp;nbsp;Â°F) leading to a 1.5% reduction in speed.&lt;ref name=PlosOne_1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Helou |first1=Nour |last2=Tafflet |first2=Muriel | last3=Berthelot | first3=Geoffroy | date=2012-05-23 | title=Impact of Environmental Parameters on Marathon Running Performance | journal=[[PLOS One]] |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=e37407 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0037407 |pmid=22649525 |pmc=3359364 | quote=[Data in] Supplementary Table 3â€“Optimal temperatures for maximal running speeds of each level of performance, with speed losses associated with each temperature increase. |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E_1 &gt; {{ cite news | url=https://www.economist.com/game-theory/2017/10/04/can-the-marathons-two-hour-barrier-be-broken | title=Can the marathon's two-hour barrier be broken? | last=S | first=J | newspaper=[[The Economist]]| date=2017-10-04 | access-date=2020-07-02 | quote=While it is unclear how muchâ€”or even ifâ€”rain or humidity alone affect marathon times, a little heat can make a big difference.

After long training runs and the marathon itself, consuming [[carbohydrate]]s to replace glycogen stores and [[protein]] to aid muscle recovery is commonly recommended.

== Health risks ==
{{See also|List of marathon fatalities}}
Marathon running has various health risks, though these can be diminished with preparation and care.&lt;ref&gt;Keener, Candace. (27 February 2008) [http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/marathon6.htm HowStuffWorks &quot;The Health Risks of the Marathon&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418183243/http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/marathon6.htm |date=18 April 2010 }}. Entertainment.howstuffworks.com. Retrieved 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Training and the races themselves can put runners under stress. While very rare, even death is a possibility during a race.

Common minor health risks include [[blister]]s, [[tendonitis]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], knee or ankle [[sprain]], dehydration ([[electrolyte imbalance]]), and other conditions. Many are categorised as overuse injuries.

=== Cardiac health ===
[[File:VVM 2007 foto 0284.JPG|thumb|Officers patrolling a marathon course in [[Ukraine]]]]
In 2016, a systematic medical review found that the risk of [[Sudden cardiac death of athletes|sudden cardiac death]] during or immediately after a marathon was between 0.6 and 1.9 deaths per 100,000 participants, varying across the specific studies and the methods used, and not controlling for age or gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine |volume=44 |issue=1 |date=January 2016 |title=Sudden cardiac death in marathons: a systematic review |vauthors=Waite O, Smith A, Madge L, Spring H, Noret N |pages=79â€“84 |doi=10.1080/00913847.2016.1135036 |pmid=26765272 |s2cid=36458482 |url=http://ray.yorksj.ac.uk/id/eprint/1282/1/Waite%20et%20al%202016.pdf |access-date=19 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921225307/https://ray.yorksj.ac.uk/id/eprint/1282/1/Waite%20et%20al%202016.pdf |archive-date=21 September 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the risk is small, cardiac screening programs for marathons are uncommon. However, this review was not an attempt to assess the overall cardiac health impact of marathon running.

A 2006 study of non-elite Boston Marathon participants tested runners for certain proteins that indicate heart damage or dysfunction (see [[Troponin]]) and gave them [[echocardiogram]] scans, before and after the marathon. The study revealed that, in that sample of 60 people, runners who had averaged less than {{convert|56|km|abbr=on}} of weekly training in the 4 months before the race were most likely to show some heart damage or dysfunction, while runners who had done more than {{convert|72|km|abbr=on}} of weekly training showed few or no heart problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Circulation |date=28 November 2006 |volume=114 |issue=22 |pages=2325â€“2533 |title=Myocardial injury and ventricular dysfunction related to training levels among non-elite participants in the Boston Marathon |vauthors=Neilan TG, etal |pmid=17101848 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.647461|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Canadian study presented in 2010, running a marathon can temporarily result in decreased function of more than half the muscle segments in the heart's main pumping chamber, but neighboring segments are generally able to compensate. Full recovery is reached within three months. The fitter the runner, the less the effect. The runners with decreased left ventricle function had an average peak weekly training distance of {{convert|55.1|km|abbr=on}}, while those who did not averaged {{convert|69.1|km|abbr=on}}. The marathon was held in {{convert|35|C}} weather. According to one of the researchers: &quot;Regular exercise reduces cardiovascular risk by a factor of two or three in the long run, but while we're doing vigorous exercise such as marathon running, our cardiac risk increases by seven.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.livescience.com/10211-temporary-heart-damage-explain-marathon-deaths.html |title=Temporary Heart Damage May Explain Marathon Deaths |first=Stephanie |last=Pappas |publisher=Live Science |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=15 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417185619/http://www.livescience.com/10211-temporary-heart-damage-explain-marathon-deaths.html |archive-date=17 April 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Canadian Journal of Cardiology |date=October 2013 |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=1269â€“1276 |title=Transient Myocardial Tissue and Function Changes During a Marathon in Less Fit Marathon Runners |vauthors=Gaudreault V, etal |doi=10.1016/j.cjca.2013.04.022|pmid=23910227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydration ===

Overconsumption is the most significant concern associated with water consumption during marathons. Drinking excessive amounts of fluid during a race can lead to dilution of sodium in the blood, a condition called [[exercise-associated hyponatremia]], which may result in vomiting, seizures, coma and even death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec12/ch156/ch156d.html Merck Manual: Hyponatremia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111045040/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec12/ch156/ch156d.html |date=11 January 2011 }}.

Lucero's cause of death was determined to be [[hyponatremic encephalopathy]], a condition that causes swelling of the brain due to an imbalance of sodium in the blood known as [[exercise-associated hyponatremia]] (EAH). While EAH is sometimes referred to as &quot;[[water intoxication]],&quot; Lucero drank large amounts of [[Gatorade]] during the race,&lt;ref name=&quot;WCVB&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctors: Marathoner Died From Too Much Water|url=http://www.wcvb.com/Doctors-Marathoner-Died-From-Too-Much-Water/11334548|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=WCVB News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012323/http://www.wcvb.com/Doctors-Marathoner-Died-From-Too-Much-Water/11334548|archive-date=19 April 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nearman|first=Steve|title=Too much of a good thing|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/oct/23/20031023-114721-5381r/?page=all|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=23 October 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419014642/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/oct/23/20031023-114721-5381r/?page=all|archive-date=19 April 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that runners who consume sodium-containing sports drinks in excess of thirst can still develop EAH.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCVB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Almond CS, Shin AY, Fortescue EB, etal |title=Hyponatremia among runners in the Boston Marathon |journal=N.

Women are more prone to hyponatremia than men. A study in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' found that 13% of runners completing the 2002 Boston Marathon had hyponatremia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Almond CS, Shin AY, Fortescue EB, etal |title=Hyponatremia among runners in the Boston Marathon |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=15 |pages=1550â€“6 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15829535 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa043901|s2cid=42909509 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1dd20ec1e1d0562b0a679e5216cc30823121a399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluid intake should be adjusted individually as factors such as body weight, sex, climate, pace, fitness ([[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max]]), and sweat rate are just a few variables that change fluid requirements between people and races. The International Marathon Medical Directors Association (IMMDA) advises that runners drink a sports drink that includes carbohydrates and electrolytes instead of plain water and that runners should &quot;drink to thirst&quot; instead of feeling compelled to drink at every fluid station.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMMDA 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aimsworldrunning.org/guidelines_fluid_replacement.htm|title=IMMDA's REVISED FLUID RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RUNNERS &amp; WALKERS|date=6 May 2006|author=Writing committee: Lewis G.

Exertional [[heat stroke]] is an emergency condition in which [[thermoregulation]] fails and the body temperature rises dangerously above {{convert|104|F|C}}.

== Charity involvement ==

Some charities seek to associate with various races. Some marathon organizers set aside a portion of their limited entry slots for charity organizations to sell to members in exchange for donations. Runners are given the option to sign up to run particular races, especially when marathon entries are no longer available to the general public.{{Citation needed|date = May 2012}}

In some cases, charities organize their own marathon as a fund-raiser, gaining funds via entry fees or through sponsorships.

In Europe, the speed marathon is a 24 hours event organized by [[TISPOL]]. The goal of the event is to make people think about the speeds they choose; speeds which are both legal and appropriate for the conditions. This should reduce the risk and prevent injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;roadsafetygb.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=UK police forces take part in 'Speed Marathon'|url=https://roadsafetygb.org.uk/news/uk-police-forces-take-part-in-speed-marathon/|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Marathon Trilogy''''' is a science fiction [[first-person shooter]] [[video game series]] from [[Bungie]], originally released for [[Mac OS]]. The name ''Marathon'' is derived from the giant interstellar [[generation ship|colony ship]] that provides the setting for the first game; the ship is constructed out of what used to be the [[Mars|Martian]] [[natural satellite|satellite]] [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. The three games in the seriesâ€”''[[Marathon (video game)|Marathon]]'' (1994), ''[[Marathon 2: Durandal]]'' (1995), and ''[[Marathon Infinity]]'' (1996)â€”are widely regarded as spiritual predecessors of Bungie's ''[[Halo (video game series)|Halo]]'' series.

==Gameplay==
Players of the ''Marathon'' games navigate futuristic 3D environments viewed from a first-person perspective. These environments are populated by hostile alien life forms or, in the case of multiplayer games, other players. Taking the role of a [[cyborg]] equipped with energy shields, the player makes use of various firearms in an attempt to kill their opponents while trying to avoid getting hit by enemies' attacks. 

Each game offers players a series of singleplayer levels and various multiplayer maps. The base geometry out of which the ''Marathon'' games' levels are constructed, such as walls, doors, and platforms, are 3D objects. However, enemies, player-held weapons, and various other objects such as ammunition pickups, are shown as 2D [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. Notably, some levels contain [[Impossible object|self-intersecting geometry]] that could not exist in normal three-dimensional space, an arrangement referred to as &quot;5D space&quot; by the games' developers.

There are two basic resources which the player must watch: their shield strength, which decreases when they are hit by enemy fire, and their oxygen reserve, which slowly depletes in underwater and vacuum areas. If either of these resources is fully depleted, the player dies, resetting their progress. There are special wall panels located throughout the levels that can be used to recharge the player's shield or oxygen reserves. Another type of wall panel called a &quot;pattern buffer&quot; allows the player to save their game progress. Various one-time-use objects, such as weapon ammunition and canisters that replenish shield energy or oxygen, can also be found while exploring the games' environments.

In most singleplayer levels, the ultimate goal is not to merely reach the end but to complete certain objectives on the way. Depending on the level, these objectives can include exterminating hostile creatures, rescuing civilians, retrieving certain items, or simply exploring a location. Most levels contain platforms, stairs and doors that players can control by activating switches. Some levels present players with simple puzzles in which the objective is to figure out the correct switches to press to continue. Another type of puzzle that is occasionally encountered involves carefully timed [[Platform game|jumps between platforms]].

Many levels have a complex, maze-like floorplan. As players move through a level, the areas they visit are automatically mapped; at any moment, the player can bring up a map of the level. The [[heads-up display]], which is always visible, has health and oxygen bars, an inventory, and a [[motion sensor]]. The inventory displays all weapons and ammunition the player picked up earlier. At any time, the player can switch out their equipped weapon for another one in their inventory; it is also possible for the player to switch to their bare fists to deliver melee attacks. The motion sensor tracks the movements of nearby characters relative to the player, distinguishing between hostile creatures and allies. On some levels the motion sensor is erratic due to magnetic artificial gravity fields.

The games' story is presented to the player through computer [[text terminal|terminal]]s. These terminals can be found in various locations throughout the singleplayer levels; when they are accessed, text-based messages are presented on screen. The contents of these terminals most often consist of messages sent by [[artificial intelligence]]s; these messages advance the games' narrative and provide the player with mission objectives. Other terminals contain civilian/alien reports or diaries, database articles, conversations between artificial intelligences and even stories or poems. After all mission objectives on a given level are completed, the player usually has to access a computer terminal to progress to the next level.

In ''Marathon 2'' and ''Marathon Infinity'', the player can swim in different types of liquids, such as water and lava; this slowly depletes their oxygen and, for some types of liquid, their shields as well. Another notable level feature in all three games is [[Teleportation#Marathon series|teleporters]], which are able to send players who use them to different parts of a level, or to other levels altogether. While the player character is unable to jump, explosive weapons can be used to [[Rocket jumping|propel]] the player to otherwise unreachable platforms. Gravity is fairly low on some levels, which makes such feats easier to perform.

''Marathon'' has five difficulty settings: Kindergarten, Easy, Normal, Major Damage, and Total Carnage. On lower difficulty levels, some hostile creatures are omitted from each level and weaker versions of enemies commonly appear. Conversely, on higher difficulty levels players will encounter stronger enemies who attack more frequentlyand have more vitality. Players can usually carry a limited amount of ammunition of each type, but on the highest difficulty setting (Total Carnage), the player is allowed to carry an unlimited amount of ammunition.

VCDs are often bilingual. Because they feature stereo audio, disc players have an option to play only the left or right audio channel. On some films, they feature English on the left audio channel and Cantonese on the right; more commonly Hong Kong VCDs will feature Mandarin on one channel and Cantonese on the other. This is similar to selecting a language track on a DVD, except it is limited to 2 languages, due to there being only two audio channels (left and right). The audio track effectively becomes monaural.

VCD's most noticeable disadvantage compared to DVD is image quality, due both to the more aggressive compression necessary to fit video into such a small capacity as well as the compression method used. Additionally, VCD movie surround sound capability is limited to Dolby Surround matrixed within the stereo tracks, while DVDs are capable of six channels of discrete surround sound via Dolby Digital AC-3.

== Hardware and software support ==
Early devices supporting Video CD playback include the [[Philips CD-i]] systems and the [[Amiga CD-32]] (albeit via an optional decoder card).&lt;ref name=&quot;NGen3&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Beginning of the End for Video CD? |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disc playback is also available both natively and as an option on some CD- and DVD-based video game consoles, including [[Sega Dreamcast]], and [[Sony PlayStation]] (only on the SCPH-5903 model).

[[VLC media player|VLC]] is a [[Free and open-source software|free, open-source]] [[media player software]] which supports VCD on [[Windows]], [[MacOS]], [[Linux]] and [[BSD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Video CD - VideoLAN Wiki|url=https://wiki.videolan.org/Video_CD|access-date=2020-08-23|website=wiki.videolan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Windows Media Player]] prior to version 9 does not support playing VCD directly. [[Windows Vista]] added native support of VCD along with DVD-Video and can launch the preferred application upon insertion. The disc format is also supported natively by [[Media Player Classic]], [[VLC Media Player]] and [[MPlayer]].&lt;ref name=mplayer&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/vcd.html | title=3.6. VCD playback | publisher=[[MPlayer]] | access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[QuickTime Player]] also does not support playing VCD directly, though it can play the .DAT files (stored under \MPEGAV for video and audio data) reliably,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22480|title=Mac OS X 10.3: Playing Video Compact Disc (VCD) media|work=apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[plugins]] were available. 

Direct access playback support is available within [[Windows XP MCE]], [[Windows Vista]] and newer (including [[Windows 10]]), [[classic Mac OS]], [[BSD]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] among others, either directly or with updates and compatible software.

Most [[DVD]] players are compatible with VCDs, and VCD-only players are available throughout Asia, and online through many shopping sites. Some older [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and HD-DVD players also retained support, as do CBHD players as well. However, most Blu-ray players, most [[vehicle audio]] with DVD/Blu-ray support, [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Xbox 360|360]], and the Sony [[PlayStation]] ([[PlayStation 2|2]]/[[PlayStation 3|3]]/[[PlayStation 4|4]]) cannot play VCDs; this is because while they have backwards playback compatibility with the DVD standard, these player can not read VCD data because the player software does not have support for MPEG-1 video and audio or the player software lacks ability to read MPEG-1 stream in DAT files alongside MPEG-1 stream in standard MPEG files.

These zones contract and form [[weather front]]s as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones [[occluded front|occlude]] as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical [[jet stream]].

Weather fronts mark the boundary between two masses of air of different [[temperature]], [[humidity]], and [[density|densities]], and are associated with the most prominent [[meteorological phenomenon|meteorological phenomena]]. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of [[thunderstorm]]s and [[severe weather]], and may on occasion be preceded by [[squall line]]s or [[dry line]]s. Such fronts form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east; [[warm front]]s form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by [[Stratus cloud|stratiform]] [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[fog]]. Warm fronts move [[Geographical pole|poleward]] ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.

[[Tropical cyclogenesis]] describes the process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core.&lt;ref name = &quot;AOML FAQ A7&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division|title = Frequently Asked Questions: What is an extra-tropical cyclone?|author = Stan Goldenberg|date = 2004-08-13|accessdate = 2007-03-23|url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases.

[[Henry Piddington]] published  40 papers dealing with [[tropical storms]] from Calcutta between 1836 and 1855 in ''[[The Journal of the Asiatic Society]]''. He also coined the term ''cyclone'', meaning the coil of a snake. In 1842, he published his landmark thesis, ''[[Laws of the Storms]]''.&lt;ref name=imd-mm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mausam.gov.in/WEBIMD/modern_meteorology.jsp|title=Modern Meteorology|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=2011-11-18}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Cyclogenesis|Tropical cyclogenesis}}
Cyclogenesis is the development or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arc&quot;/&gt; Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes that all result in the development of some sort of cyclone. It can occur at various scales, from the microscale to the synoptic scale.

Extratropical cyclones begin as waves along [[weather fronts]] before occluding later in their life cycle as cold-core systems. However, some intense extratropical cyclones can become warm-core systems when a  [[warm seclusion]] occurs.

Tropical cyclones form as a result of significant convective activity, and are warm core.&lt;ref name = &quot;AOML FAQ A7&quot;/&gt; Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation.&lt;ref name = &quot;FoN&quot;/&gt; [[Waterspout]]s can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical [[wind shear]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NWS&quot;&gt;[[National Weather Service]] Key West [https://web.archive.org/web/20050211013703/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/eyw/HTML/spoutweb.htm summary of waterspout types]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis, and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of [[high-pressure area]]s—[[Anticyclogenesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CyclogenesisDef&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|author= Glossary of Meteorology|title=Cyclogenesis |date = June 2000 |url = http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Cyclogenesis |accessdate = 2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A surface low can form in a variety of ways. Topography can create a surface low. [[Mesoscale Convective System|Mesoscale convective systems]] can spawn surface lows that are initially warm core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Raymond D. Menard |author2=J.M.

Around the low, the flow becomes cyclonic. This rotational flow moves polar air towards the equator on the west side of the low, while warm air move towards the pole on the east side. A cold front appears on the west side, while a warm front forms on the east side. Usually, the cold front moves at a quicker pace than the warm front and &quot;catches up&quot; with it due to the slow erosion of higher density air mass out ahead of the cyclone. In addition, the higher density air mass sweeping in behind the cyclone strengthens the higher pressure, denser cold air mass. The cold front over takes the warm front, and reduces the length of the warm front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glenn Elert|year=2006|work=The Physics Factbook|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/RachelChu.shtml|title=Density of Air|accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point an [[occluded front]] forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft, which is also known as a [[trowal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=St. Louis University|url=http://www.eas.slu.edu/CIPS/Presentations/Conferences/NWA2002/Snow_NWA_02/tsld003.htm|publisher=[[National Weather Association]]|title=What is a trowal?|accessdate=2010-01-01|date=2004-09-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080608235916/http://www.eas.slu.edu/CIPS/Presentations/Conferences/NWA2002/Snow_NWA_02/tsld003.htm |archivedate = June 8, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropical cyclogenesis is the development and strengthening of a [[tropical cyclone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CYCDEF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Nina A. Zaitseva |year=2006 |url=http://nsidc.org/arcticmet/glossary/cyclogenesis.html |title=Definition for Cyclogenesis |publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center |accessdate=2006-10-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830135741/http://www.nsidc.org/arcticmet/glossary/cyclogenesis.html |archivedate=2006-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms by which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those that produce mid-[[latitude]] cyclones. Tropical cyclogenesis, the development of a [[Tropical cyclone#Mechanics|warm-core]] cyclone, begins with significant [[convection]] in a favorable atmospheric environment. There are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis: 
# sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thethermograpiclibrary.org/index.php?title=Fichier:Water_cooling.jpg Cyclon in a board]. thethermograpiclibrary.org&lt;/ref&gt;

An average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones (at least Category&amp;nbsp;3 intensity on the [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Chris Landsea|url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/climvari/table.html|title = Climate Variability table&amp;nbsp;— Tropical Cyclones|publisher = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]]|date=2000-01-04| accessdate =2006-10-19|author-link = Chris Landsea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Extratropical&quot; is applied to cyclones outside the tropics, in the middle latitudes. These systems may also be described as &quot;mid-latitude cyclones&quot; due to their area of formation, or &quot;post-tropical cyclones&quot; when a tropical cyclone has moved ([[Extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|extratropical transition]]) beyond the tropics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ExtraLessonMillUni&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ExtratropicalPhases&quot;&gt;{{cite web

=====Polar low=====
{{Main|Polar low}}
[[File:Sea of Japan polar low 2009-12-20 0213Z.jpg|thumb|A polar low over the [[Sea of Japan]] in December 2009]]
A '''polar low''' is a small-scale, short-lived atmospheric [[low-pressure area|low-pressure system]] (depression) that is found over the ocean areas poleward of the main [[polar front]] in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Polar lows were first identified on the meteorological satellite imagery that became available in the 1960s, which revealed many small-scale cloud vortices at high latitudes. The most active polar lows are found over certain ice-free maritime areas in or near the Arctic during the winter, such as the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Labrador Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Polar lows dissipate rapidly when they make landfall. Antarctic systems tend to be weaker than their northern counterparts since the air-sea temperature differences around the continent are generally smaller {{citation needed|reason=As far as I know, the Arctic and Antarctic oceans are both warmer than the air above, at about the freezing point, and the air over the ocean is generally colder in the Antarctic due to the katabatic winds sweeping off the continent|date=July 2015}}. However, vigorous polar lows can be found over the Southern Ocean. During winter, when cold-core lows with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach {{convert|-45|C|F}} move over open waters, deep convection forms, which allows [[polar low]] development to become possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-tBa1DWYoDIC&amp;pg=PA227|title=Polar lows: mesoscale weather systems in the polar regions|page=224|author1=Erik A.

They are part of the larger class of [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] weather systems. Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude operations, such as shipping and gas and oil platforms. Polar lows have been referred to by many other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, Arctic hurricane, Arctic low, and cold air depression. Today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near-surface winds of at least 17&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=E. A. Rasmussen |author2=J.

A '''subtropical cyclone''' is a [[weather]] system that has some characteristics of a [[tropical cyclone]] and some characteristics of an [[extratropical cyclone]]. They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel.&lt;ref name = &quot;A6&quot;/&gt; As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David B.

Since they form from extratropical cyclones, which have colder temperatures aloft than normally found in the tropics, the sea surface temperatures required is around 23&amp;nbsp;degrees Celsius (73&amp;nbsp;°F) for their formation, which is  three degrees Celsius (5&amp;nbsp;°F) lower than for tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistSubTropCyclones&quot;&gt;{{cite web

====Tropical====
{{main|Tropical cyclone}}
[[File:2017 Atlantic hurricane season summary map.png|thumb|[[2017 Atlantic hurricane season]] summary map]]
A '''tropical cyclone''' is a [[storm|storm system]] characterized by a [[low-pressure system|low-pressure]] center and numerous [[thunderstorm]]s that produce strong winds and [[flood]]ing [[rain]]. A tropical cyclone feeds on heat released when moist [[air]] rises, resulting in [[condensation]] of [[water vapour]] contained in the moist air. They are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as [[nor'easter]]s, [[European windstorm]]s, and [[polar low]]s, leading to their classification as &quot;warm core&quot; storm systems.&lt;ref name = &quot;AOML FAQ A7&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Cyclone Catarina from the ISS on March 26 2004.JPG|thumb|275px|left|[[Hurricane Catarina]], a rare [[South Atlantic tropical cyclone]] viewed from the [[International Space Station]] on March 26, 2004]]

The term &quot;tropical&quot; refers to both the geographic origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively in [[tropics|tropical]] regions of the globe, and their dependence on [[Air mass#Classification and notation|Maritime Tropical air masses]] for their formation. The term &quot;cyclone&quot; refers to the storms' cyclonic nature, with [[Clockwise and counterclockwise|counterclockwise]] rotation in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and clockwise rotation in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Depending on their location and strength, tropical cyclones are referred to by other names, such as hurricane, [[typhoon]], tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, or simply as a cyclone.

While tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential [[rain]], they are also able to produce high waves and a damaging [[storm surge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxfo&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/epirev/mxi011|pmid=15958424|author1=James M.

They develop over large bodies of warm water,&lt;ref name=&quot;AOML FAQ A15&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Landsea |title=Frequently Asked Questions: How do tropical cyclones form? |date=2009-02-06 |publisher=[[NOAA]] |accessdate=2006-07-26 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827030639/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html |archivedate=2009-08-27 |author-link=Chris Landsea }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence lose their strength if they move over land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sim Aberson|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/C2.html|title=Subject : C2) Doesn't the friction over land kill tropical cyclones?|accessdate=2008-02-25|date=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone, while inland regions are relatively safe from strong winds. Heavy rains, however, can produce significant flooding inland. Storm surges are rises in sea level caused by the reduced pressure of the core that in effect &quot;sucks&quot; the water upward and from winds that in effect &quot;pile&quot; the water up. Storm surges can produce extensive [[coastal flooding|coastal flooding]] up to {{convert|40|km|mi}} from the coastline. Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones can also relieve [[drought]] conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005 EPac outlook&quot;&gt;[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].

As a result, tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth's [[troposphere]].

Many tropical cyclones [[tropical cyclogenesis|develop]] when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable. Others form when [[#Related cyclone types|other types of cyclones]] acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by [[#Steering winds|steering winds]] in the [[troposphere]]; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]]. On the other end of the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses.&lt;ref name = &quot;AOML FAQ A7&quot;/&gt; A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.&lt;ref name=PadgetDecember2000&gt;{{cite web|author = Padgett, Gary|url = http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2001/summ0012.htm|title = Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary for December 2000|year = 2001|accessdate = 2006-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polar cyclone====
{{main|Polar cyclone}}
A '''polar''', '''sub-polar''', or '''Arctic cyclone''' (also known as a [[polar vortex]])&lt;ref name = &quot;glossvortex&quot;/&gt; is a vast area of low pressure that strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Halldór Björnsson |date=2005-01-19 |url=http://andvari.vedur.is/~halldor/HB/Met210old/GlobCirc.html |title=Global circulation |publisher=Veðurstofa Íslands |accessdate=2008-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807132251/http://andvari.vedur.is/~halldor/HB/Met210old/GlobCirc.html |archivedate=2011-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A polar cyclone is a low-pressure [[weather system]], usually spanning {{convert|1000|km|mi}} to {{convert|2000|km|mi}}, in which the air circulates in a counterclockwise direction in the northern hemisphere, and a clockwise direction in the southern hemisphere. The Coriolis acceleration acting on  the air masses moving poleward at high altitude, causes a counterclockwise circulation at high altitude. The poleward movement of air originates from the air circulation of the [[atmospheric circulation#Latitudinal circulation features|Polar cell]]. The polar low is not driven by convection as are tropical cyclones, nor the cold and warm air mass interactions as are extratropical cyclones, but is an artifact of the global air movement of the Polar cell. The base of the polar low is in the mid to upper troposphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the polar cyclone has two centers on average. One center lies near Baffin Island and the other over northeast Siberia.&lt;ref name=&quot;glossvortex&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Polar_vortex|title=Polar vortex|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern hemisphere, it tends to be located near the edge of the [[Ross ice shelf]] near 160 west longitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rui-Rong Chen |author2=Don L.

====TUTT cell====
{{Main|Upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex}}
Under specific circumstances, upper level cold lows can break off from the base of the Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT), which is located mid-ocean in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months. These upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices, also known as TUTT cells or TUTT lows, usually move slowly from east-northeast to west-southwest, and their bases generally do not extend below {{convert|20,000|ft|m}} in altitude. A weak inverted surface trough within the [[trade wind]] is generally found underneath them, and they may also be associated with broad areas of high-level clouds. Downward development results in an increase of [[cumulus cloud]]s and the appearance of a surface vortex. In rare cases, they become warm-core [[tropical cyclone]]s. Upper cyclones and the upper troughs that trail tropical cyclones can cause additional outflow channels and aid in their intensification. Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbance/cyclone.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLARK&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author = Clark Evans|url = http://flhurricane.com/cyclone/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Number=64429&amp;an=0&amp;page=0|title = Favorable trough interactions on tropical cyclones|publisher = Flhurricane.com|date = January 5, 2006|accessdate = 2006-10-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061017001243/http://flhurricane.com/cyclone/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Number=64429&amp;an=0&amp;page=0|archive-date = October 17, 2006|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMSPAPER&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Deborah Hanley |author2=John Molinari |author3=Daniel Keyser |title = A Composite Study of the Interactions between Tropical Cyclones and Upper-Tropospheric Troughs|date=October 2001|journal = [[Monthly Weather Review]]|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|volume = 129|issue = 10|pages = 2570–84|doi = 10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129&lt;2570:ACSOTI&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 2001MWRv..129.2570H   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesoscale==
The following types of cyclones are not identifiable in synoptic charts.

===Mesocyclone===
{{Main|Mesocyclone}}
A '''mesocyclone''' is a [[vortex]] of air, {{convert|2.0|km|mi}} to {{convert|10|km|mi}} in diameter (the [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale of meteorology]]), within a [[convection|convective]] [[storm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MesocyloneDef&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Mesocyclone|author=Glossary of Meteorology|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|date=June 2000 |url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Mesocyclone|accessdate=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air rises and rotates around a vertical axis, usually in the same direction as low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere.

===Tornado===
{{main|Tornado}}

A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. Also referred to as twisters, a colloquial term in America, or cyclones, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low-pressure circulation.

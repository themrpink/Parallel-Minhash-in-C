[[Shimizu Jirocho]] (1820–1893) is Japan's most famous yakuza and folk hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld (25th Anniversary Edition) |last1=Kaplan |first1=David E.|last2=Dubro |first2=Alec |year= 2012|publisher=the University of California Press |isbn= 978-0520215627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shimizu's real name was Chogoro Yamamoto.&lt;ref name=&quot;jirocho&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Portraits of Modern Japanese Historical Figures |publisher= National Diet Library, Japan |date=May 22, 2007 |url=https://www.ndl.go.jp/portrait/e/datas/278.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190722171934/https://www.ndl.go.jp/portrait/e/datas/278.html |archive-date=July 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His life and exploits were featured in sixteen films between 1911 and 1940.

The roots of the Yakuza survive today in [[initiation ceremony|initiation ceremonies]], which incorporate tekiya or bakuto [[rituals]]. Although the modern Yakuza has diversified, some gangs still identify with one group or the other; for example, a gang whose primary source of income is illegal gambling may refer to themselves as ''bakuto''.

===Kyushu===
[[File:Japan Kyushu Region large.png|thumb|right|[[Kyushu]] island, the largest source of ''yakuza'' members.]]
Throughout history, especially since the modern era, [[Kyushu]] island has been the largest source of ''yakuza'' members, including many renowned bosses in the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]].  Isokichi Yoshida (1867–1936) from the [[Kitakyushu]] area was considered{{by whom|date=March 2020}} the first renowned modern ''yakuza''. Recently [[Shinobu Tsukasa]] and Kunio Inoue, the bosses of the two most powerful clans in the Yamaguchi-gumi, originate from Kyushu. [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], the northernmost part of the island, has the largest number of [[#Designated boryokudan|designated syndicates]] among all of the prefectures.

== Organization and activities ==

=== Structure ===
[[File:Yakuza hierarchy.png|right|thumb|Yakuza hierarchy]]
During the formation of the Yakuza, they adopted the traditional Japanese hierarchical structure of oyabun-kobun where ''kobun'' (子分; lit. foster child) owe their allegiance to the {{nihongo|''oyabun''|親分||lit. foster parent}}.  In a much later period, the code of {{nihongo|''jingi''|仁義||justice and duty}} was developed where loyalty and respect are a way of life.

The oyabun-kobun relationship is formalized by ceremonial sharing of [[sake]] from a single cup. This ritual is not exclusive to the Yakuza—it is also commonly performed in traditional Japanese [[Shinto]] weddings, and may have been a part of ''sworn brotherhood'' relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruno|first=Anthony|title=The Yakuza - Oyabun-Kobun, Father-Child|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/2.html|publisher=[[truTV]]|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II]] period in Japan, the more traditional tekiya/bakuto form of organization declined as the entire population was mobilised to participate in the war effort and society came under the control of the strict military government. However, after the war, the Yakuza adapted again.

Prospective Yakuza come from all walks of life. The most romantic tales tell how Yakuza accept sons who have been abandoned or exiled by their parents. Many Yakuza start out in junior high school or high school as common street thugs or members of [[bōsōzoku]] gangs.  Perhaps because of its lower socio-economic status, numerous Yakuza members come from [[Burakumin]] and ethnic Korean backgrounds.

Yakuza groups are headed by an ''oyabun'' or {{nihongo|''kumichō''|組長||family head}} who gives orders to his subordinates, the ''kobun''. In this respect, the organization is a variation of the traditional Japanese [[senpai]]-[[kohai|kōhai]] (senior-junior) model. Members of Yakuza gangs cut their family ties and transfer their loyalty to the gang boss. They refer to each other as family members - fathers and elder and younger brothers. The Yakuza is populated almost entirely by men and the very few women who are acknowledged are the wives of bosses, who are referred to by the title {{nihongo|''ane-san''|姐さん||older sister}}. When the 3rd [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] boss ([[Kazuo Taoka]]) died in the early 1980s, his wife (Fumiko) took over as boss of Yamaguchi-gumi, albeit for a short time.

Yakuza have a complex organizational structure. There is an [[Capo di tutti capi|overall boss]] of the syndicate, the ''kumicho'', and directly beneath him are the ''saiko komon'' (senior advisor) and ''so-honbucho '' (headquarters chief). The second in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] is the ''wakagashira'', who governs several gangs in a region with the help of a ''fuku-honbucho'' who is himself responsible for several gangs. The regional gangs themselves are governed by their local boss, the ''shateigashira''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/2.html|title=The Yakuza, the Japanese Mafia –The Crime Library – Crime Library on truTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each member's connection is ranked by the hierarchy of sakazuki (sake sharing). Kumicho are at the top, and control various {{nihongo|''saikō-komon''|最高顧問||senior advisors}}. The saikō-komon control their own turfs in different areas or cities. They have their own underlings, including other [[underboss]]es, advisors, accountants and enforcers.

Those who have received sake from oyabun are part of the immediate family and ranked in terms of elder or younger brothers. However, each kobun, in turn, can offer sakazuki as oyabun to his underling to form an affiliated organisation, which might in turn form lower ranked organizations. In the Yamaguchi-gumi, which controls some 2,500 businesses and 500 Yakuza groups, there are fifth rank subsidiary organizations.&lt;!--

==== Rituals ====
[[File:Beato, Felice (1834 – 1907) - Tattooed japanese men - ca. 1870.jpg|thumb|right|An early example of [[Irezumi]] tattoos, 1870s.]]

[[Yubitsume]], or the cutting off of one's finger, is a form of penance or apology. Upon a first offense, the transgressor must cut off the tip of his left little finger and give the severed portion to his boss. Sometimes an underboss may do this in penance to the oyabun if he wants to spare a member of his own gang from further retaliation. This practice has started to wane amongst the younger members, due to it being an easy identifier for police.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/15/asia/yakuza-yamaguchi-gumi-explainer/ | publisher=CNN | title=The yakuza: Inside Japan's murky criminal underworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its origin stems from the traditional way of holding a [[Kenjutsu|Japanese sword]]. The bottom three fingers of each hand are used to grip the sword tightly, with the thumb and index fingers slightly loose. The removal of digits starting with the little finger moving up the hand to the index finger progressively weakens a person's sword grip.

The idea is that a person with a weak sword grip then has to rely more on the group for protection—reducing individual action. In recent years, [[prosthetic]] fingertips have been developed to disguise this distinctive appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv.com&quot;/&gt;

Many Yakuza have full-body tattoos (including their [[genitalia]]). These tattoos, known as [[irezumi]] in Japan, are still often &quot;hand-poked&quot;, that is, the ink is inserted beneath the skin using non-electrical, hand-made and handheld tools with needles of sharpened bamboo or steel. The procedure is expensive, painful, and can take years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Japanorama]]'', [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]], Series 2, Episode 3, first aired 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When Yakuza members play [[Oicho-Kabu]] cards with each other, they often remove their shirts or open them up and drape them around their waists. This enables them to display their full-body tattoos to each other. This is one of the few times that Yakuza members display their tattoos to others, as they normally keep them concealed in public with long-sleeved and high-necked shirts. When new members join, they are often required to remove their trousers as well and reveal any lower body tattoos.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

| {{Nihongo|[[Yamaguchi-gumi]] |山口組|Yamaguchi-gumi}}
| The Yamaguchi-gumi is the largest Yakuza family, accounting for 30% of all Yakuza in Japan, with more than 8,900 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; From its headquarters in [[Kobe]], it directs criminal activities throughout Japan. It is also involved in operations in Asia and the United States. [[Kenichi Shinoda|Shinobu Tsukasa]], also known as Kenichi Shinoda, is the Yamaguchi-gumi's current oyabun. He follows an expansionist policy, and has increased operations in [[Tokyo]] (which has not traditionally been the territory of the Yamaguchi-gumi.)

The Yamaguchi family is successful to the point where its name has become synonymous with Japanese organized crime in many parts of Asia outside Japan.  Many Chinese or Korean persons who do not know the name &quot;Yakuza&quot; would know the name &quot;Yamaguchi-gumi&quot;, which is frequently portrayed in gangster films.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Structurally, Sumiyoshi-kai differs from its principal rival, the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]], in that it functions like a [[federation]].

Under the Organized Crime Countermeasures Law, the Prefectural Public Safety Commissions have registered 24 syndicates as the designated boryokudan groups. [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] has the largest number of designated boryokudan groups among all of the prefectures, at 5; the [[Kudo-kai]], the [[Taishu-kai]], the [[Fukuhaku-kai]], the [[Dojin-kai]] and the [[Kyushu Seido-kai|Namikawa-kai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npa.go.jp/keidai/keidai.files/tamurakouen.pdf &quot;Retrospection and Outlook of Crime Measure&quot;, p. 15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927123804/http://www.npa.go.jp/keidai/keidai.files/tamurakouen.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}, Masahiro Tamura, 2009, ''[[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]]'' {{in lang|ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Organized Crime Countermeasures Law was enacted, many Yakuza syndicates made efforts to restructure to appear more professional and legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reilly |first1=Edward |title=Criminalizing Yakuza Membership: A Comparative Study of the Anti-Boryokudan Law |journal=Washington University Global Studies Law Review |date=1 January 2014 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=801–829 |id={{Gale|A418089219}} |url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_globalstudies/vol13/iss4/9/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designated boryokudan groups are usually large organizations (mostly formed before [[World War II]], some before the [[Meiji Restoration]] of the 19th century); however, there are some exceptions such as the [[Kyushu Seido-kai|Namikawa-kai]], which, with its blatant armed conflicts with the [[Dojin-kai]], was registered only two years after its formation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Yakuza are regarded as semi-legitimate organizations. For example, immediately after the [[Kobe earthquake]], the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]], whose headquarters are in [[Kobe]], mobilized itself to provide disaster relief services (including the use of a helicopter), and this was widely reported by the media as a contrast to the much slower response by the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | work = The New York Times | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DF1E31F931A15752C0A963958260 | title = Quake in Japan: Gangsters; Gang in Kobe Organizes Aid for People in Quake | first=James | last=Sterngold | date=22 January 1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sawada |first1=Yasuyuki |last2=Shimizutani |first2=Satoshi |title=How Do People Cope with Natural Disasters?

The yakuza and its affiliated gangs control drug trafficking in Japan, especially [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;Vorobyov, Niko (2019) ''Dopeworld.'' Hodder, UK. p. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt; While many Yakuza syndicates, notably the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]], officially forbid their members from engaging in [[drug trafficking]], some other Yakuza syndicates, notably the [[Dojin-kai]], are heavily involved in it.

Some Yakuza groups are known to deal extensively in [[human trafficking in Japan|human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/countries/japan|title=HumanTrafficking.org, &quot;Human Trafficking in Japan&quot;|access-date=10 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115130632/http://www.humantrafficking.org/countries/japan|archive-date=15 November 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippines]], for instance, is a source of young women. Yakuza trick girls from impoverished villages into coming to Japan, where they are promised respectable jobs with good wages. Instead, they are forced into becoming sex workers and strippers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/4.html|title=The Yakuza, the Japanese Mafia – The Crime Library – Crime Library on truTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kabukicho-Shinjuku-Tokyo_20120204.jpg|thumb|right|The alleys and streets of [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]] are a popular modern Tokyo Yakuza hangout.]]
Yakuza frequently engage in a unique form of Japanese extortion known as ''[[sōkaiya]]''. In essence, this is a specialized form of [[protection racket]]. Instead of harassing small businesses, the Yakuza harass a stockholders' meeting of a larger corporation. They simply scare the ordinary stockholder with the presence of Yakuza operatives, who obtain the right to attend the meeting by making a small purchase of stock.

Yakuza also have ties to the Japanese realty market and banking, through ''jiageya''. Jiageya specialize in inducing holders of small real estate to sell their property so that estate companies can carry out much larger development plans. Japan's bubble economy of the 1980s is often blamed on real estate speculation by banking subsidiaries. After the collapse of the Japanese property bubble, a manager of a major bank in [[Nagoya]] was assassinated, and much speculation ensued about the banking industry's indirect connection to the Japanese underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.ft.com/content/57bcd6b2-9ecd-11e5-b45d-4812f209f861 | work=Financial Times | title=US clamps down on Japanese Yakuza mafia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Japan-Yakuza-Sanja Matsuri-01.jpg|thumb|right|Yakuza often take part in local festivals such as [[Sanja Matsuri]] where they often ride the shrine through the streets proudly showing off their elaborate tattoos.]]
Yakuza have been known to make large investments in legitimate, mainstream companies. In 1989, Susumu Ishii, the [[Oyabun]] of the [[Inagawa-kai]] (a well known Yakuza group) bought [[United States dollar|US$]]255 million worth of [[Tokyo Kyuko Electric Railway]]'s stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaplan |first1=David E. |last2=Dubro |first2=Alec |title=Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld |year=2012 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-27490-7 }}{{page needed|date=August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's [[Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission]] has knowledge of more than 50 listed companies with ties to organized crime, and in March 2008, the [[Osaka Securities Exchange]] decided to review all listed companies and expel those with Yakuza ties.&lt;ref name=adelstein&gt;Jake Adelstein. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/09/AR2008050902544.html This Mob Is Big in Japan], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 11 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As a matter of principle, theft is not recognised as a legitimate activity of Yakuza. This is in line with the idea that their activities are semi-open; theft by definition would be a covert activity. More importantly, such an act would be considered a trespass by the community. Also, Yakuza usually do not conduct the actual business operation by themselves. Core business activities such as merchandising, loan sharking or management of gambling houses are typically managed by non-Yakuza members who pay protection fees for their activities.

There is much evidence of Yakuza involvement in international crime. There are many tattooed Yakuza members imprisoned in various Asian prisons for such crimes as drug trafficking and arms smuggling. In 1997, one verified Yakuza member was caught smuggling 4 kilograms (8.82 pounds) of [[heroin]] into Canada.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Because of their history as a legitimate feudal organization and their connection to the Japanese political system through the ''[[uyoku dantai]]'' (extreme right-wing political groups), Yakuza are somewhat a part of the Japanese establishment, with six [[fan magazine]]s reporting on their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-yakuzas-ties-to-the-japanese-right-wing-000 | work=Vice Today | title=The Yakuza's Ties to the Japanese Right Wing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yakuza involvement in politics functions similarly to that of a lobbying group, with them backing those who share in their opinions or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/12/13/the-yakuza-lobby/ | work=Foreign Policy | title=The Yakuza Lobby}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that 1 in 10 adults under the age of 40 believed that the Yakuza should be allowed to exist.{{r|adelstein20110318}} In the 1980s in [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], a Yakuza war spiraled out of control and civilians were hurt. It was a large conflict between the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] and [[Dojin-kai]], called the ''Yama-Michi War''. The police stepped in and forced the Yakuza bosses on both sides to declare a truce in public.

At various times, people in Japanese cities have launched anti-Yakuza campaigns with mixed and varied success. In March 1995, the Japanese government passed the ''Act for Prevention of Unlawful Activities by Criminal Gang Members'', which made traditional [[racketeering]] much more difficult. Beginning in 2009, led by agency chief [[Takaharu Ando]], Japanese police began to crack down on the gangs. [[Kodo-kai]] chief [[Kiyoshi Takayama]] was arrested in late 2010. In December 2010, police arrested Yamaguchi-gumi's alleged number three leader, [[Tadashi Irie]]. According to the media, encouraged by tougher anti-Yakuza laws and legislation, local governments and construction companies have begun to shun or ban Yakuza activities or involvement in their communities or construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;Zeller, Frank ([[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]-[[Jiji Press|Jiji]]), &quot;Yakuza served notice days of looking the other way are over,&quot; ''[[Japan Times]]'', 26 January 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The police are handicapped, however, by Japan's lack of an equivalent to [[plea bargaining]], [[witness protection]], or the United States' [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]].{{r|adelstein}} Laws were enacted in Osaka and Tokyo in 2010 and 2011 to try to combat Yakuza influence by making it illegal for any business to do business with the Yakuza.&lt;ref&gt;Botting, Geoff, &quot;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20111016bj.html Average Joe could be collateral damage in war against yakuza]&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 October 2011, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark, &quot;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fd20120304bj.html Anti-yakuza laws are taking their toll]&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 4 March 2012, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yakuza's aid in Tōhoku catastrophe====
Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] on 11 March 2011, the Yakuza sent hundreds of trucks filled with food, water, blankets, and sanitary accessories to aid the people in the affected areas of the natural disaster. [[CNN en Español|CNN México]] said that although the Yakuza operates through extortion and other violent methods, they &quot;[moved] swiftly and quietly to provide aid to those most in need.&quot;&lt;ref name=cnnmexico&gt;{{cite news|title=La mafia japonesa de los 'yakuza' envía alimentos a las víctimas del sismo|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/mundo/2011/03/25/la-mafia-japonesa-de-los-yakuza-envia-alimentos-a-las-victimas-del-sismo|accessdate=28 February 2012|newspaper=[[CNN en Español|CNN México]]|date=25 March 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such actions by the Yakuza are a result of their knowing of what it is like to &quot;fend for yourself,&quot; without any government aid or community support, because they are also considered &quot;outcasts&quot; and &quot;dropouts from society&quot;.&lt;ref name=cnnmexico/&gt; In addition, the Yakuza's code of honor (''ninkyo'') reportedly values justice and duty above anything else, and forbids allowing others to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yue Jones|first=Terril|title=Yakuza among first with relief supplies in Japan|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/25/us-yakuza-idUSTRE72O6TF20110325|accessdate=28 February 2012|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Yakuza activity in the United States is mostly restricted to [[Hawaii]], but they have made their presence known in other parts of the country, especially in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], as well as [[Seattle]], [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]], [[Arizona]], [[Virginia]], [[Chicago]], and [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=crimelibrary&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/5.html Yakuza] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911231912/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/5.html |date=11 September 2008 }}, Crimelibrary.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yakuza03-america&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaplan |first1=David E. |last2=Dubro |first2=Alec |title=Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld |year=2003 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-21562-7 }}{{page needed|date=August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yakuza are said to use Hawaii as a midway station between Japan and mainland America, smuggling [[methamphetamine]] into the country and smuggling firearms back to Japan.  They easily fit into the local population, since many tourists from Japan and other Asian countries visit the islands on a regular basis, and there is a large population of residents who are of full or partial Japanese descent. They also work with local gangs, funneling Japanese tourists to gambling parlors and brothels.&lt;ref name=crimelibrary/&gt;

In California, the Yakuza have made alliances with local Korean gangs as well as [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese triads]]. They allied with Vietnamese gangs to use them as muscle, as they had potential to become extremely violent as needed. The Yakuza saw their potential following the constant Vietnamese cafe shoot-outs and home invasion burglaries throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In New York City, they appear to collect finder's fees from Russian, Irish and Italian gang members and businessmen for guiding Japanese tourists to gambling establishments, both legal and illegal.&lt;ref name=crimelibrary/&gt;

[[Handgun]]s manufactured in the US account for a large share (33%) of handguns seized in Japan, followed by [[China]] (16%) and the [[Philippines]] (10%).  In 1990, a [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] [[.38 caliber]] [[revolver]] that cost $275 in the US could sell for up to $4,000 in Tokyo. By 1997 it would sell for only $500 due to the proliferation of guns in Japan during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=yakuza03-america/&gt;

The [[FBI]] suspects that the Yakuza use various operations to launder money in the U.S.&lt;ref name=adelstein/&gt;

In 2001, the FBI's representative in Tokyo arranged for [[Tadamasa Goto]], the head of the group [[Goto-gumi]], to receive a [[liver transplant]] at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] in the United States, in return for information of Yamaguchi-gumi operations in the US.  This was done without prior consultation of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|NPA]]. The journalist who uncovered the deal received threats by Goto and was given police protection in the US and in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;adelstein&quot;/&gt;

=== East Asia outside Japan ===
The yakuza have been engaged in [[Southeast Asia]] since the 1960s; they are working there to develop sex tourism and drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bouissou |first1=Jean-Marie |title=Le marché des services criminels au Japon.

In addition to their presence in Southeast Asian countries such as [[Thailand]], [[the Philippines]], and [[Vietnam]], yakuza groups also operate in [[South Korea]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]],  and in the [[Pacific Islands]] (especially [[Hawaii]])&lt;ref name=&quot;page104&quot; &gt;Jean-François Gayraud, ''Le Monde des mafias'', édition 2008, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakuza groups also have a presence in North Korea; in 2009, Yakuza member Yoshiaki Sawada was released from North Korea after spending five years in the country for attempting to bribe a North Korean official and smuggle drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090116a6.html Yakuza returns after five years in North Korea jail on drug charge] 2009-01-16 The Japan Times&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constituent members==
According to a 2006 speech by Mitsuhiro Suganuma, a former officer of the Public Security Intelligence Agency, around 60 percent of Yakuza members come from burakumin, the descendants of a feudal outcast class and approximately 30 percent of them are Japanese-born Koreans, and only 10 percent are from non-burakumin Japanese and Chinese ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fccj.or.jp/node/1468|title=Mitsuhiro Suganuma, &quot;Japan's Intelligence Services&quot;|publisher=The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan|access-date=3 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330051608/http://www.fccj.or.jp/node/1468|archive-date=30 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Capital punishment – Japan's yakuza vie for control of Tokyo |journal=Jane's Intelligence Review |date=December 2009 |url=http://www.kosuke.net/japanyakuza.pdf |page=4|quote=Around 60% of yakuza members come from burakumin, the descendants of a feudal outcast class, according to a 2006 speech by Mitsuhiro Suganuma, a former officer of the Public Security Intelligence Agency.

=== Burakumin ===
The [[burakumin]] are a group that is socially discriminated against in Japanese society, whose recorded history goes back to the [[Heian period]] in the 11th century. The burakumin are [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of outcast communities of the pre-modern, especially the [[feudal Japan hierarchy|feudal era]], mainly those with occupations considered tainted with death or [[ritual impurity]], such as butchers, [[executioner]]s, [[undertaker]]s, or [[leather worker]]s. They traditionally lived in their own secluded [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]].

According to [[David E. Kaplan (author)|David E. Kaplan]] and Alec Dubro, burakumin account for about 70% of the members of [[Yamaguchi-gumi]], the largest Yakuza syndicate in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dubro |first1=A. |last2=Kaplan |first2=David E. |title=Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld |date= 1986 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-201-11151-4 }}{{page needed|date=August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnic Koreans ===
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2008}}
While [[Koreans in Japan|ethnic Koreans]] make up only 0.5% of the Japanese population, they are a prominent part of Yakuza because they suffer severe discrimination in Japanese society alongside the ''[[burakumin]]''.&lt;ref name=yakuza03-133&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaplan |first1=David E. |last2=Dubro |first2=Alec |title=Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld |year=2003 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-21562-7 |page=133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kristof |first1=Nicholas D. |title=Japan's Invisible Minority: Better Off Than in Past, but StillOutcasts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/30/world/japan-s-invisible-minority-better-off-than-in-past-but-stilloutcasts.html |work=The New York Times |date=30 November 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, 18 of 90 top bosses of ''[[Inagawa-kai]]'' were ethnic Koreans. The [[National Police Agency (Japan)|Japanese National Police Agency]] suggested Koreans composed 10% of the Yakuza proper and 70% of ''burakumin'' in the ''[[Yamaguchi-gumi]]''.&lt;ref name=yakuza03-133 /&gt; Some of the representatives of the [[Bōryokudan#Designated bōryokudan|designated Bōryokudan]] are also Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.npa.go.jp/sosikihanzai/bouryokudan/boutai8/20070820.pdf &quot;Boryokudan Situation in the Early 2007&quot;], [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]], 2007, p. 22. See also [[Bōryokudan#Designated bōryokudan]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean significance had been an untouchable taboo in Japan and one of the reasons that the Japanese version of Kaplan and Dubro's ''Yakuza'' (1986) had not been published until 1991 with the deletion of Korean-related descriptions of the ''Yamaguchi-gumi''.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Dubro (2003) Preface to the new edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese-born people of recent Korean ancestry are considered resident aliens because of their nationality and are often shunned in legitimate trades, and are therefore embraced by the Yakuza precisely because they fit the group's &quot;outsider&quot; image.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno, A. (2007). &quot;The Yakuza, the Japanese Mafia&quot; CrimeLibrary: Time Warner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;/&gt; Notable Yakuza members of Korean ancestry include [[Hisayuki Machii]] the founder of the [[Toa-kai|Tosei-kai]], Jiro Yanagawa the founder of the Yanagawa-gumi, Hirofumi Hashimoto the founder of the Kyokushinrengo-kai, [[Tokutaro Takayama]] the head of the 4th-generation [[Aizukotetsu-kai]], Jiro Kiyota the head of the 5th-generation [[Inagawa-kai]], the head of the 5th/7th-generation [[Goda-ikka]], Shinichi Matsuyama the head of the 5th-generation [[Kyokuto-kai]], Kuniyasu Makino the head of the 5th-generation [[Matsuba-kai]], Akira Takamura the head of the 5th-generation [[Soai-kai]], Chojiro Murakami the head of the 1st-generation [[Kyushu Seido-kai]], Masahiro Namikawa the head of the 2nd-generation Kyushu Seido-kai &amp; founder of the [[Kyushu Seido-kai|Namikawa-kai]], the head of the 3rd/4th-generation [[Fukuhaku-kai]], and the head of the 6th/7th/8th-generation [[Sakaume-gumi]].

==Indirect enforcement==
Since 2011, regulations that made business with members illegal as well as enactments of [[Yakuza exclusion ordinances]] led to the group's membership decline from its 21st century peak. Methods include that which brought down [[Al Capone]]: checking the organization's finances. The [[Financial Services Agency]] ordered [[Mizuho Financial Group]], Inc. to improve compliance and that its top executives report by 28 October 2013 what they knew and when about a consumer-credit affiliate found making loans to crime groups. This adds pressure to the group from the U.S. as well where an executive order in 2011 required financial institutions to freeze Yakuza assets. As of 2013, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] has frozen about US$55,000 of Yakuza holdings, including two Japan-issued American Express cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-22/yazkuza-mobsters-whacked-by-regulators-freezing-amexs.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Yakuza Bosses Whacked by Regulators Freezing AmEx Cards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

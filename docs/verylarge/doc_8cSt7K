Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, ''Javot'' (1896), the score for the film ''[[The Assassination of the Duke of Guise|L'assassinat du duc de Guise]]'' (1908),{{refn|This music is sometimes cited as the first score composed for a film, but there were earlier examples including one by [[Herman Finck]] (1904).&lt;ref&gt;Wierzbicki, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} and incidental music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916. Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by [[Molière]] and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]].&lt;ref name=fallon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concertante works===
Saint-Saëns was the first major French composer to write piano concertos. His [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Saëns)|First]], in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Saëns)|Second]], in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works. The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary [[sonata form]] first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn [[cadenza]]. The [[scherzo]] second movement and ''[[Tempo markings|presto]]'' finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist [[Zygmunt Stojowski]] commented that the work &quot;begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Herter, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Third Piano Concerto]], in E{{music|flat}} (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines.&lt;ref name=schonberg/&gt; The [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Saint-Saëns)|Fourth]], in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second. It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos. According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns &quot;the Beethoven of France&quot; (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony).&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1989), p. 3; and Deruchie, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor. The work is known as the &quot;Egyptian&quot; concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in [[Luxor]], and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Saëns)|First Cello Concerto]], in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section. It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by [[Pablo Casals]] and later players.&lt;ref&gt;Ratner (2002), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cello Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Saëns)|Second]], in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections. It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saint-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult. There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Saëns)|Second]], in C major.&lt;ref&gt;Ratner (2002), p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; The First, in A, was also completed in 1858. It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Ratner (2002), p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Ratner (2002), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Violin Concerto No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Third]], in B minor, written for [[Pablo de Sarasate]], is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2009), pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the [[Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso]], in A minor, Op. 28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863. It changes from a wistful and tense opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, &quot;After a multi-stopped cadenza&amp;nbsp;... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Larner, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operas===
[[File:Samson-et-dalila-1892.jpg|thumb|alt=Press illustration of opera production, showing singer playing Samson demolishing the enemy temple|''[[Samson et Dalila]]'' at the [[Paris Opéra]], 1892: Samson ([[Edmond Vergnet]]) destroys the Philistine temple]]
Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished ''Frédégonde'', Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are ''[[Opéra comique|opéras comiques]]''. During the composer's lifetime his ''[[Henry VIII (opera)|Henry VIII]]'' became a repertory piece; since his death only ''Samson et Dalila'' has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, ''[[Ascanio]]'' (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work.&lt;ref name=schonberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=crichton/&gt; The critic [[Ronald Crichton]] writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns &quot;lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior&quot;.&lt;ref name=crichton/&gt; In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: &quot;Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Saëns's biographer [[James Harding (music writer)|James Harding]] comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of ''La princesse jaune'', which Harding describes as like Sullivan &quot;with a light French touch&quot;.&lt;ref name=h119&gt;Harding, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Saint-Saëns was friendly with Sullivan, and liked his music, making a point of seeing the latest [[Savoy opera]] when in London.&lt;ref name=h119/&gt;|group= n}}

Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as &quot;a bridge between [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] and the serious French operas of the early 1890s&quot;.&lt;ref name=crichton353&gt;Crichton, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – &quot;lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content{{space}}... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.&quot;&lt;ref name=crichton/&gt; Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models.

Retrieved 18 February 2015 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Wagner he derived the use of [[leitmotif]]s, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as [[Through-composed#Opera and musicals|through composition]] is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less variety of tempo within individual numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of recorded opera [[Alan Blyth]] writes that Saint-Saëns &quot;certainly learned much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of ''[[Aida]]'', and Wagner, but from these excellent models he forged his own style.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blyth, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other vocal music===
[[File:Corneille-Lamartine-Hugo-Klein.jpg|thumb|alt=head and shoulders portraits of three 19th-century and one 20th-century writers, all of middle age|[[Pierre Corneille]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Herman Klein]], whose words Saint-Saëns set in songs and choral works]]
From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed ''[[mélodie]]s'', writing more than 140.&lt;ref&gt;Fauser, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] or other German composers of ''[[Lieder]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fauser, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – ''Mélodies persanes'' (&quot;Persian Songs&quot;, 1870) and ''Le Cendre rouge'' (&quot;The Red Ash Tree&quot;, 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was [[Victor Hugo]]; others included [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Amable Tastu]], and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer [[Lili Boulanger]] that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: &quot;you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fauser, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ''mélodies'' are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including &quot;Le lever du soleil sur le Nil&quot; (&quot;Sunrise over the Nile&quot;, 1898) and &quot;Hymne à la paix&quot; (&quot;Hymn to Peace&quot;, 1919), are for voice and orchestra.&lt;ref name=fallon/&gt; His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]].&lt;ref&gt;Fauser, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from [[motet]]s to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios ''Le déluge'' (1875) and ''The Promised Land'' (1913) with an English text by [[Herman Klein]].&lt;ref name=fallon /&gt; He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, &quot;One likes to be appreciated in the home, ''par excellence'', of oratorio.&quot;&lt;ref name=klein /&gt; He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra.&lt;ref name=fallon /&gt; In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Saëns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it.&lt;ref name=klein /&gt;

===Solo keyboard===
Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, &quot;this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark&quot;.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; Nichols excepts the ''Étude en forme de valse'' (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique.&lt;ref name=ox&gt;Nichols, Roger.

In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as &quot;Souvenir d'Italie&quot; (1887), &quot;Les cloches du soir&quot; (&quot;Evening bells&quot;, 1889) and &quot;Souvenir d'Ismaïlia&quot; (1895).&lt;ref name=fallon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Maurice J E, and Kenneth L Hamilton.

Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, pp. 525–558&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them were written for use in church services – &quot;Offertoire&quot; (1853), &quot;Bénédiction nuptiale&quot; (1859), &quot;Communion&quot; (1859) and others. After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former.&lt;ref name=fallon /&gt;

===Chamber===
Saint-Saëns wrote more than forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years. One of the first of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, confident piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other ''cantabile''.&lt;ref name=r2005 /&gt; The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms. At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of [[Baroque music|baroque]] composers including [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]].&lt;ref name=g2 /&gt;

{{Quote box |bgcolor=#CEF6EC|salign=right| quote = Saint-Saëns's chamber works reveal the complete man: his sense of tradition coupled with imagination, his feeling for colour, his sense of humour, his desire for balance and symmetry, his love of clarity. |source= Sabina Teller Ratner, 2005&lt;ref name=r2005&gt;Ratner (2005), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;|align=left| width=30%}}In Ratner's view, the most important of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment.&lt;ref name=r2005/&gt; The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by ''Grove's Dictionary'' as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions. The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards.&lt;ref name=g2/&gt; The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier. It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment. Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees, p. 381&quot;/&gt;

The woodwind sonatas are among the composer's last works. Ratner writes of them, &quot;The spare, evocative, classical lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=r2005 /&gt; Gallois comments that the [[Oboe Sonata (Saint-Saëns)|Oboe Sonata]] begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of [[tarantella]]. For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata is the most important of the three: he calls it &quot;a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism&quot; amounting to &quot;a summary of the rest&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gallois, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; The work contrasts a &quot;doleful [[threnody]]&quot; in the slow movement with the finale, which &quot;pirouettes in 4/4 time&quot;, in a style reminiscent of the 18th century. The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata &quot;a model of transparency, vitality and lightness&quot;, containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;Gallois, pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt;

The composer's most famous work, ''The Carnival of the Animals'' (1887), although far from a typical chamber piece, is written for eleven players, and is considered by ''Grove's Dictionary'' to be part of Saint-Saëns's chamber output. ''Grove'' rates it as &quot;his most brilliant comic work, parodying Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Rossini, his own ''Danse macabre'' and several popular tunes&quot;.&lt;ref name=g2/&gt; He forbade performances of it during his lifetime, concerned that its frivolity would damage his reputation as a serious composer.&lt;ref name=duchen/&gt;

===Recordings===
Saint-Saëns was a pioneer in recorded music. In June 1904 [[The Gramophone Company]] of London sent its producer [[Fred Gaisberg]] to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the [[mezzo-soprano]] Meyriane Héglon in arias from ''Ascanio'' and ''Samson et Dalila'', and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra).&lt;ref name=marston&gt;

In the early days of the [[LP record]], Saint-Saëns's works were patchily represented on disc. ''The Record Guide'' (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of ''Danse Macabre'', ''The Carnival of the Animals'', the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works.&lt;ref&gt;Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, pp. 642–644&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD.

==Honours and reputation==
Saint-Saëns was made a Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1867 and promoted to Officier in 1884, and Grand Croix in 1913. Foreign honours included the British [[Royal Victorian Order]] (CVO) in 1902, and honorary doctorates from the universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (1893) and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1907).&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U202564 &quot;Saint-Saëns, Camille&quot;], ''Who Was Who'', Oxford University Press, 2014.

In its obituary notice, ''The Times'' commented:
{{quote|The death of M. Saint-Saëns not only deprives France of one of her most distinguished composers; it removes from the world the last representative of the great movements in music which were typical of the 19th century. He had maintained so vigorous a vitality and kept in such close touch with present-day activities that, though it had become customary to speak of him as the ''doyen'' of French composers, it was easy to forget the place he actually took in musical chronology. He was only two years younger than Brahms, was five years older than Tchaikovsky, six years older than [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], and seven years older than Sullivan. He held a position in his own country's music certain aspects of which may be fitly compared with each of those masters in their own spheres.&lt;ref name=times&gt;&quot;M. Saint-Saëns&quot;, ''The Times'', 19 December 1921, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

In a short poem, &quot;Mea culpa&quot;, published in 1890 Saint-Saëns accused himself of lack of decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were not for him.{{refn|&quot;''Mea culpa!'' Je m'accuse de n'être point décadent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gallois, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, &quot;His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;M. Saint-Saëns's Essays&quot;, ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 23 June 1910, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form. The critic [[H. C. Colles|Henry Colles]], wrote, a few days after the composer's death:
{{quote|In his desire to maintain &quot;the perfect equilibrium&quot; we find the limitation of Saint-Saëns's appeal to the ordinary musical mind. Saint-Saëns rarely, if ever, takes any risks; he never, to use the slang of the moment, &quot;goes off the deep end&quot;. All his greatest contemporaries did. Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and even Franck, were ready to sacrifice everything for the end each wanted to reach, to drown in the attempt to get there if necessary. Saint-Saëns, in preserving his equilibrium, allows his hearers to preserve theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Colles, H. C. &quot;Camille Saint-Saëns&quot;, ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 22 December 1921, p. 853&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

''Grove'' concludes its article on Saint-Saëns with the observation that although his works are remarkably consistent, &quot;it cannot be said that he evolved a distinctive musical style. Rather, he defended the French tradition that threatened to be engulfed by Wagnerian influences and created the environment that nourished his successors&quot;.&lt;ref name=g2/&gt;

Since the composer's death writers sympathetic to his music have expressed regret that he is known by the musical public for only a handful of his scores such as ''The Carnival of the Animals'', the Second Piano Concerto, the Third Violin Concerto, the Organ Symphony, ''Samson et Dalila'', ''Danse macabre'' and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso. Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the [[Oratorio de Noël|Christmas Oratorio]], the ballet ''Javotte'', the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces.&lt;ref name=nicholas /&gt; In 2004, the cellist [[Steven Isserlis]] said, &quot;Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself&amp;nbsp;... there are Masses, all of which are interesting. I've played all his cello music and there isn't one bad piece. His works are rewarding in every way. And he's an endlessly fascinating figure.&quot;&lt;ref name=duchen /&gt;

'''Dressage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|r|ɛ|s|ɑː|ʒ}} or {{IPAc-en|d|r|ᵻ|ˈ|s|ɑː|ʒ}}; a [[France|French]] term, most commonly translated to mean &quot;training&quot;) is a form of riding performed in exhibition and competition, as well as an &quot;art&quot; sometimes pursued solely for the sake of mastery. As an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] sport defined by the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|International Equestrian Federation]], dressage is described as &quot;the highest expression of [[horse training]]&quot; where &quot;horse and rider are expected to perform from memory a series of predetermined movements.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-dressage About Dressage], International Equestrian Federation, retrieved August 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Competitions are held at all levels from amateur to the [[Olympic Games]] and [[World Equestrian Games]]. Its fundamental purpose is to develop, through standardized progressive training methods, a horse's natural athletic ability and willingness to perform, thereby maximizing its potential as a [[Equestrianism|riding horse]]. At the peak of a dressage horse's gymnastic development, the horse responds smoothly to a skilled rider's [[riding aids|minimal aids]]. The rider is relaxed and appears effort-free while the horse willingly performs the requested movement.

The discipline has a rich history with ancient roots in the writings of [[Xenophon]]. Modern dressage has evolved as an important equestrian pursuit since the [[Renaissance]] when [[Federico Grisone]]'s &quot;The Rules of Riding&quot; was published in 1550, the first treatise on equitation in over a thousand years since Xenophon's ''[[On Horsemanship]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Federico Grisone |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Federico-Grisone |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much about training systems used today reflects practices of [[classical dressage]].

In modern dressage competition, successful [[animal training|training]] at the various levels is demonstrated through the performance of &quot;tests&quot;, prescribed series of movements ridden within a standard arena. [[Dressage judge|Judges]] evaluate each movement on the basis of an objective standard appropriate to the level of the test and assign each movement a score from [[Scale of one to ten|zero to ten]]&amp;nbsp;– zero being &quot;not executed&quot; and 10 being &quot;excellent&quot;. A score of 9 is very good and is a high mark, while a competitor achieving all 6s (or 60% overall) should be considering moving on to the next level.

== Dressage horses ==
[[File:Charlotte Dujardin 2012 Olympic Dressage-1.JPG|thumb|An upper level dressage horse and rider perform a series of movements upon which they will be judged.]]
[[File:WC07b.JPG|thumb|An [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] at the passage in a classical frame.]]
The most popular [[List of horse breeds|horse breeds]] seen at the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]] and other international [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] competitions are [[warmblood]] horses bred for dressage.

In [[classical dressage]] training and performances that involve the &quot;airs above the ground&quot; (''described [[Dressage#&quot;Airs&quot; above the ground|below]]''), the [[baroque horse|&quot;baroque&quot; breeds]] of horses are popular and purposely bred for these specialties.

== Arena ==
There are two sizes of arenas, small and standard. Each has letters assigned to positions around the arena for dressage tests to specify where movements are to be performed. Cones with letters on them are positioned on the sidelines of the arena for reference as to where a movement is to be performed.

The small arena is {{convert|20|by|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} and is used for the lower levels of [[eventing]] in the dressage phase, as well as for some pure dressage competitions at lower levels. Its letters around the outside edge, starting from the point of entry and moving clockwise, are A-K-E-H-C-M-B-F.  Letters also mark locations along the &quot;center line&quot; in the middle of the arena. Moving down the center line from A, they are D-X-G, with X being directly between E and B.

[[File:Dressage ring schema.svg|thumb|right|350px|Standard dressage arena, {{convert|20|by|60|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}]]
The standard arena is {{convert|20|by|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and is used for tests in both pure dressage and [[eventing]]. The standard dressage arena letters are A-K-V-E-S-H-C-M-R-B-P-F. The letters on the long sides of the arena, nearest the corners, are {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in from the corners, and are {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} apart from each other. The letters along the center line are D-L-X-I-G, with X again being halfway down the arena. There is speculation as to why these letters were chosen. Most commonly it is believed because the German cavalry had a 20 × 60-meter area in-between the barracks which had the letters posted above the doors.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In addition to the center line, the arena also has two &quot;quarter lines&quot;, which lie between the center line and the long side of the arena. However, these are infrequently, if ever, used for competition except in a freestyle.

At the start of the test, the horse enters the arena at an opening at A. Ideally this opening is then closed for the duration of the test. However, this is not always logistically possible, particularly at smaller competitions with few volunteers.

==Judges==
[[Dressage judge|Judges]] are registered through their national federation depending on the judge's experience and training, with the highest qualified being registered with the FEI for international competition. Judges are strictly regulated to ensure as consistent marking as possible within the limits of subjectivity, and in FEI competitions, it is expected that all judges' final percentage be within five percent of each other.

There is always a judge sitting at C, although for upper-level competition, there can be up to seven judges at different places around the arena&amp;nbsp;— at C, E, B, K, F, M, and H&amp;nbsp;— which allows the horse to be seen in each movement from all angles. This helps prevent certain faults from going unnoticed, which may be difficult for a judge to see from only one area of the arena. For example, the horse's straightness going across the diagonal may be assessed by judges at M and H.

Although the judge's positions are known by their closest letter, only C, B, &amp; E are actually directly behind their respective marker, with the other judges being on the short sides (on a plane with C, and two metres in from the edge of the arena for M &amp; H, and at the A end of the arena and five metres in from the long side of the arena for F &amp; K) rather than on the long side where the letter would seem to indicate.

== Competition ==
[[File:Uitgestrektedraf.jpg|thumb|An upper-level dressage horse at the extended trot.]]
Dressage competitions consist of a series of individual tests with an increasing  [[level of difficulty]]. The most accomplished horse and rider teams perform FEI tests, written by the international equestrian governing body called the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|Fédération Équestre Internationale]] or FEI. The highest level of modern competition is at the Grand Prix level. This is the level test ridden in the prestigious international competitions (CDIs), such as the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] games, Dressage World Cup, and [[World Equestrian Games]]. Dressage governed by the rules of the FEI include the following levels: &quot;small tour&quot; (Prix St. Georges and Intermediate I) Intermediate A, Intermediate B and &quot;big tour&quot; (Intermediate II, Grand Prix and Grand Prix Special).

In addition, there are four to six lower levels, occasionally more, regulated in individual nations by their respective national federation (such as the USDF in America, British Dressage, Dressage Australia etc.). The lower levels ask horses for basic [[horse gait|gaits]], relatively large circles, and a lower level of [[collection (horse)|collection]] than the international levels. Lateral movements are not required in the earliest levels, and movements such as the [[leg yield]], [[shoulder-in]], or [[haunches-in]] are gradually introduced as the horse progresses, until the point at which the horse can compete in the FEI levels.

Apart from competition, there is the tradition of [[classical dressage]], in which the traditional training of dressage is pursued as an art form. The traditions of the masters who originated Dressage are kept alive by the [[Spanish Riding School]] in Vienna, Austria, Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre in Lisbon, Portugal, and the ''[[Cadre Noir]]'' in Saumur, France. This type of schooling is also a part of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] [[bullfighting]] exhibitions.

=== Tests ===
Dressage tests are the formalized sequence of a number of dressage [[Riding figures|movements]] used in competition. Although horses and riders are competing against each other, tests are completed by one horse and rider combination at a time, and horses and riders are judged against a common standard, rather than having their performance scored relative to the other competitors.

At the upper levels, tests for international competitions, including the Olympics, are issued under the auspices of the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]]. At the lower levels, and as part of dressage training each country authorizes its own set of tests. For example, in the US it is the [[United States Equestrian Federation]] and the [[United States Dressage Federation]]. In Great Britain, dressage is overseen by [[British Dressage]]. [[Pony Club]]s also produce their own tests, including basic walk/trot tests which cater for child riders. The Annual Pony Club National Championships include a dressage element with very high level riders attending, most notable being Callum Barker (Emmanuel School) who is known for his Dressage skill and well groomed pony.

Each test is segmented into a number of sequential blocks which may contain one or more movements. Each block is generally scored between zero and ten on a scale such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usef.org/documents/ruleBook/2013/08-DR.pdf 2013 USEF Rule Book, dressage division, Rule DR-122]&lt;/ref&gt;

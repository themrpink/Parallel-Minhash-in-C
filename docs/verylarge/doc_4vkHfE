In [[chemistry]], '''hydronium''' (hydroxonium in traditional British English) is the common name for the [[aqueous]] [[cation]] {{H3O+}}, the type of [[oxonium ion]] produced by [[protonation]] of [[water]].  It is the positive ion present when an [[Arrhenius acid]] is dissolved in water, as Arrhenius acid [[molecules]] in [[solution]] give up a [[proton]] (a positive hydrogen ion, {{chem2|H+}}) to the surrounding water molecules ({{H2O}}).

==Determination of pH==
The concentration of hydronium ions determines a solution's [[pH]].  The concentration of [[hydroxide]] ions determines a solution's [[pH#pOH|pOH]]. The molecules in pure water [[self-ionization of water|auto-dissociate]] (''i.e''.: react with each other) into hydronium and hydroxide ions in the following equilibrium:

:{{chem2|2 H2O &lt;-&gt; OH- + H3O+}}

In pure water, there is an equal number of hydroxide and hydronium ions, so it is a neutral solution. At {{convert|25|C|F}}, water has a pH of 7 and a pOH of 7 (this varies when the temperature changes: see [[self-ionization of water]]). A pH value less than 7 indicates an acidic solution, and a pH value more than 7 indicates a basic solution.

==Nomenclature==
According to [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Parent hydride cations|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry]], the hydronium ion should be referred to as ''oxonium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_583.htm |title=Table 17 Mononuclear parent onium ions |publisher=IUPAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hydroxonium'' may also be used unambiguously to identify it. A draft [[IUPAC]] proposal also recommends the use of oxonium and ''oxidanium'' in organic and inorganic chemistry contexts, respectively.

An [[oxonium ion]] is any ion with a trivalent oxygen cation. For example, a protonated [[hydroxyl group]] is an oxonium ion, but not a hydronium ion.

==Structure==

Since {{chem2|O+}} and N have the same number of electrons, {{H3O+}} is [[isoelectronic]] with [[ammonia]]. As shown in the images above, {{H3O+}} has a [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]] with the oxygen atom at its apex. The {{chem2|H\sO\sH}} [[bond angle]] is approximately 113°,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Infrared spectroscopy of {{H3O+}}: the v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; fundamental band | first1 = Jian | last1 = Tang |first2 = Takeshi | last2 = Oka | journal = [[Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy]] | volume = 196 | pages = 120–130 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1006/jmsp.1999.7844 | pmid = 10361062 | issue = 1| bibcode = 1999JMoSp.196..120T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the center of mass is very close to the oxygen atom. Because the base of the pyramid is made up of three identical hydrogen atoms, the {{H3O+}} molecule's symmetric top configuration is such that it belongs to the {{chem2|C_{3v}|}} [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]]. Because of this symmetry and the fact that it has a dipole moment, the rotational selection rules are Δ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±1 and Δ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The transition dipole lies along the ''c''-axis and, because the negative charge is localized near the oxygen atom, the dipole moment points to the apex, perpendicular to the base plane.

==Acids and acidity==
Hydronium is the cation that forms from [[water (molecule)|water]] in the presence of [[hydrogen ion]]s. These [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Hydron|hydrons]] do not exist in a free state - they are extremely reactive and are [[solvation|solvated]] by water. An [[acid]]ic solute is generally the source of the hydrons, but hydronium ions exist even in pure water. This special case of water reacting with water to produce hydronium (and [[hydroxide]]) ions is commonly known as the [[self-ionization of water]]. The resulting hydronium ions are few and short-lived. [[pH]] is a measure of the relative activity of hydronium and hydroxide ions in aqueous solutions. In acidic solutions, hydronium is the more active, its excess proton being readily available for reaction with basic species.

The hydronium ion is very acidic: at 25&amp;nbsp;°C, its [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] is approximately 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meister |first1=Erich |last2=Willeke |first2=Martin |last3=Angst |first3=Werner |last4=Togni |first4=Antonio |last5=Walde |first5=Peter |date=2014 |title=Confusing Quantitative Descriptions of Brønsted-Lowry Acid-Base Equilibria in Chemistry Textbooks – A Critical Review and Clarifications for Chemical Educators |journal=[[Helv. Chim. Acta]] |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=1–31 |doi=10.1002/hlca.201300321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The values commonly given for p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;aq&lt;/sup&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are 0 or –1.74.  The former uses the convention that the activity of the solvent in a dilute solution (in this case, water) is 1, while the latter uses the value of the concentration of water in the pure liquid of 55.5 M, and persuasive arguments can be given for each choice.  The disagreement comes from the ambiguity that to define p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O has to act simultaneously as a solute and the solvent.  The IUPAC has not given an official definition of p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; that would resolve this ambiguity.  Burgot has argued that H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) ⇄ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) is simply not a thermodynamically well-defined process.  For an estimate of p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;aq&lt;/sup&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), Burgot suggests taking the measured value p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;EtOH&lt;/sup&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) = 0.3, the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in ethanol, and applying the correlation equation p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;aq&lt;/sup&gt; = p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;EtOH&lt;/sup&gt; – 1.0 (± 0.3) to convert the ethanol p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; to an aqueous value, to give a value of p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;aq&lt;/sup&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) = –0.7 (± 0.3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burgot|first=Jean-Louis|date=1998|title=PerspectiveNew point of view on the meaning and on the values of Ka○(H3O+, H2O) and Kb○(H2O, OH−) pairs in water|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=a705491b|journal=The Analyst|volume=123|issue=2|pages=409–410|doi=10.1039/a705491b}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most acidic species that can exist in water (assuming sufficient water for dissolution): any stronger acid will ionize and protonate a water molecule to form hydronium. The acidity of hydronium is the implicit standard used to judge the strength of an acid in water: [[strong acid]]s must be better proton donors than hydronium, otherwise a significant portion of acid will exist in a non-ionized state (i.e.: a weak acid). Unlike hydronium in neutral solutions that result from water's autodissociation, hydronium ions in acidic solutions are long-lasting and concentrated, in proportion to the strength of the dissolved acid.

pH was originally conceived to be a measure of the [[hydrogen ion]] concentration of aqueous solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sorensen |first1=S. P. L. |date=1909 |title=Ueber die Messung und die Bedeutung der Wasserstoffionenkonzentration bei enzymatischen Prozessen |url= |journal=[[Biochemische Zeitschrift]] |language=de |volume=21 |issue= |pages=131–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all such free protons quickly react with water to form hydronium; acidity of an aqueous solution is therefore more accurately characterized by its hydronium concentration. In organic syntheses, such as acid catalyzed reactions, the hydronium ion ({{H3O+}}) can be used interchangeably with the {{chem2|H+}} ion; choosing one over the other has no significant effect on the mechanism of reaction.

==Solvation==
Researchers have yet to fully characterize the [[solvation]] of hydronium ion in water, in part because many different meanings of solvation exist. A [[freezing-point depression]] study determined that the mean hydration ion in cold water is approximately {{chem2|H3O+(H2O)6}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zavitsas |first1=A. A. |date=2001 |title=Properties of water solutions of electrolytes and nonelectrolytes |url= |journal=[[The Journal of Physical Chemistry B]] |volume=105 |issue=32 |pages=7805–7815 |doi=10.1021/jp011053l}}&lt;/ref&gt; on average, each hydronium ion is solvated by 6 water molecules which are unable to solvate other solute molecules.

Some hydration structures are quite large: the {{chem2|H3O+(H2O)20}} magic ion number structure (called ''magic'' because of its increased stability with respect to hydration structures involving a comparable number of water molecules – this is a similar usage of the word ''magic'' as in [[magic number (physics)|nuclear physics]]) might place the hydronium inside a [[dodecahedron|dodecahedral]] cage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hulthe |first1=G. |last2=Stenhagen |first2=G. |last3=Wennerström |first3=O. |last4=Ottosson |first4=C-H. |date=1997 |title=Water cluster studied by electrospray mass spectrometry |doi=10.1016/S0021-9673(97)00486-X |journal=[[Journal of Chromatography A]] |volume=512 |issue= |pages=155–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio method]] molecular dynamics simulations have shown that, on average, the hydrated proton resides on the surface of the {{chem2|H3O+(H2O)20}} cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iyengar |first1=S. S. |last2=Petersen |first2=M. K. |last3=Burnham |first3=C. J. |last4=Day |first4=T. J. F. |last5=Voth |first5=G. A. |last6=Voth |first6=G. A. |date=2005 |title=The Properties of Ion-Water Clusters.

[[Image:Zundel-cation.JPG|thumb|Zundel cation]]
Two other well-known structures are the ''Zundel cation'' and the ''Eigen cation''. The Eigen solvation structure has the hydronium ion at the center of an {{chem2|H9O4(+)}} complex in which the hydronium is strongly [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] to three neighbouring water molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zundel|first1=G. |last2= Metzger|first2=H. |date=1968|title= Energiebänder der tunnelnden Überschuß-Protonen in flüssigen Säuren.

E. |last3=Hutter |first3=J. |last4=Parrinello |first4=M. |year=1999 |title=The nature of the hydrated excess proton in water |doi=10.1038/17579 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=397 |issue=6720 |pages=601–604 |bibcode=1999Natur.397..601M|s2cid=204991299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isolation of the hydronium ion monomer in liquid phase was achieved in a nonaqueous, low nucleophilicity [[superacid]] solution ({{chem2|HF(-)SbF5SO2}}).  The ion was characterized by high resolution {{chem2|^{17}O}} [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00508a040| title = Water and related systems. 1.

A new model was proposed by Stoyanov&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja9101826|pmc=2946644|pmid=20078058| title = The Structure of the Hydrogen Ion ({{chem|H|aq|+}}) in Water| journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]| volume = 132| issue = 5| pages = 1484–1485| date = January 15, 2010| last1 = Stoyanov | first1 = Evgenii S. | last2 = Stoyanova | first2 = Irina V. | last3 = Reed | first3 = Christopher A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[infrared spectroscopy]] in which the proton exists as an {{chem2|H13O6+}} ion.  The positive charge is thus delocalized over 6 water molecules.

==Solid hydronium salts==
For many [[strong acids]], it is possible to form crystals of their hydronium salt that are relatively stable.  These salts are sometimes called ''acid monohydrates''.  As a rule, any acid with an [[ionization constant]] of {{10^|9}} or higher may do this.  Acids whose ionization constants are below {{10^|9}} generally cannot form stable {{H3O+}} salts.  For example, [[nitric acid]] has an ionization constant of {{10^|1.4}}, and mixtures with water at all proportions are liquid at room temperature.  However, [[perchloric acid]] has an ionization constant of {{10^|10}}, and if liquid anhydrous perchloric acid and water are combined in a 1:1 molar ratio, they react to form solid hydronium perchlorate ({{chem2|H3O+*ClO4(-)}}).

The hydronium ion also forms stable compounds with the [[carborane superacid]] {{chem2|H(CB11H(CH3)5Br6)}}.&lt;ref&gt;

The {{chem2|[H3O][H(CB11HCl11)]}} salt is also soluble in [[benzene]]. In crystals grown from a benzene solution the solvent co-crystallizes and a {{chem2|H3O*(C6H6)3}} cation is completely separated from the anion. In the cation three benzene molecules surround hydronium forming [[pi bond|pi]]-cation interactions with the hydrogen atoms. The closest (non-bonding) approach of the anion at chlorine to the cation at oxygen is 348 pm.

There are also many examples of hydrated hydronium ions known, such as the {{chem2|H5O2(+)}} ion in {{chem2|HCl*2H2O}}, the {{chem2|H7O3(+)}} and {{chem2|H9O4(+)}} ions both found in {{chem2|HBr*4H2O}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstellar chemistry===
As mentioned previously, {{H3O+}} is found in both diffuse and dense molecular clouds. By applying the reaction rate constants (''α'', ''β'', and ''γ'') corresponding to all of the currently available characterized reactions involving {{H3O+}}, it is possible to calculate ''k''(''T'') for each of these reactions. By multiplying these ''k''(''T'') by the relative abundances of the products, the relative rates (in cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s) for each reaction at a given temperature can be determined. These relative rates can be made in absolute rates by multiplying them by the {{chem2|[H2]^{2}|}}.&lt;ref name=udfa&gt;{{cite web|title = {{H3O+}} formation reactions|url = http://udfa.ajmarkwick.net/index.php?species=41|work = The UMIST Database for Astrochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; By assuming {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;K}} for a dense cloud and {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;50&amp;nbsp;K}} for a diffuse cloud, the results indicate that most dominant formation and destruction mechanisms were the same for both cases. It should be mentioned that the relative abundances used in these calculations correspond to TMC-1, a dense molecular cloud, and that the calculated relative rates are therefore expected to be more accurate at {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;K}}. The three fastest formation and destruction mechanisms are listed in the table below, along with their relative rates. Note that the rates of these six reactions are such that they make up approximately 99% of hydronium ion's chemical interactions under these conditions.&lt;ref name=rauer1997ica /&gt; All three destruction mechanisms in the table below are classified as [[dissociative recombination]] reactions.

It is also worth noting that the relative rates for the formation reactions in the table above are the same for a given reaction at both temperatures. This is due to the reaction rate constants for these reactions having ''β'' and ''γ'' constants of 0, resulting in {{math|1=''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''α''}} which is independent of temperature.

Since all three of these reactions produce either {{H2O-nl}} or OH, these results reinforce the strong connection between their relative abundances and that of {{H3O+}}. The rates of these six reactions are such that they make up approximately 99% of hydronium ion's chemical interactions under these conditions.

===Astronomical detections===

As early as 1973 and before the first interstellar detection, chemical models of the interstellar medium (the first corresponding to a dense cloud) predicted that hydronium was an abundant molecular ion and that it played an important role in ion-neutral chemistry.&lt;ref name=herbst1973fad&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herbst |first1=E. |last2=Klemperer |first2=W. |year=1973 |title=The formation and depletion of molecules in dense interstellar clouds |url= |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=185 |issue= |page=505 |doi=10.1086/152436 |bibcode=1973ApJ...185..505H}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, before an astronomical search could be underway there was still the matter of determining hydronium's spectroscopic features in the gas phase, which at this point were unknown. The first studies of these characteristics came in 1977,&lt;ref name=schwarz1977gpi&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwarz |first1=H.A. |year=1977 |title=Gas phase infrared spectra of oxonium hydrate ions from 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;μm |url= |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Physics]] |volume=67 |issue=12 |page=5525 |doi=10.1063/1.434748 |bibcode=1977JChPh..67.5525S}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by other, higher resolution spectroscopy experiments. Once several lines had been identified in the laboratory, the first interstellar detection of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was made by two groups almost simultaneously in 1986.&lt;ref name=hollis1986ilc /&gt;&lt;ref name=wootten1986sih /&gt; The first, published in June 1986, reported observation of the ''J''{{su|b=''K''|p=vt}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1{{su|b=1|p=−}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2{{su|b=1|p=+}} transition at {{val|307192.41|u=MHz}} in OMC-1 and Sgr B2. The second, published in August, reported observation of the same transition toward the Orion-KL nebula.

These first detections have been followed by observations of a number of additional {{H3O+}} transitions. The first observations of each subsequent transition detection are given below in chronological order:

In 1991, the 3{{su|b=2|p=+}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2{{su|b=2|p=−}} transition at {{val|364797.427|u=MHz}} was observed in OMC-1 and Sgr B2.&lt;ref name=wootten1991myx&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1086/186178 |title=Detection of interstellar {{H3O+}} – A confirming line |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=380 |pages=L79 |year=1991 |last1=Wootten |first1=A. |last2=Turner |first2=B.

'''Methylchloroisothiazolinone''', also referred to as '''MCI''', is a [[preservative]] with antibacterial and antifungal effects within the group of [[isothiazolinone]]s. These compounds have an active sulphur moiety that is able to oxidize thiol-containing residues, thereby effectively killing most aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Collier | title = Growth inhibitory and biocidal activity of some isothiazolone biocides | journal = Journal of Applied Bacteriology | year = 1990 | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 569–577 | pmid = 2292520 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.1990.tb01550.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Methylchloroisothiazolinone is effective against [[Gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive]] and [[gram-negative bacteria]], [[yeast]], and [[fungi]]. 

Methylchloroisothiazolinone is found in many water-based personal care products and cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reinhard| title = Preservation of products with MCI/MI in Switzerland | journal = Contact Dermatitis | year = 2001 | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–264 | pmid = 11722483 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0536.2001.450501.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methylchloroisothiazolinone was first used in cosmetics in the 1970s. It is also used in glue production, detergents, paints, fuels, and other industrial processes. Methylchloroisothiazolinone is known by the registered tradename '''Kathon''' CG when used in combination with [[methylisothiazolinone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Knudsen BB, Menne T | title = Kathon CG--a new contact sensitizing preservative | journal = Ugeskrift for Lægerer | year = 1990 | volume = 152 | issue = 10 | pages = 656–657 | pmid = 2321281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methylchloroisothiazolinone may be used in combination with other preservatives including [[ethylparaben]], [[benzalkonium chloride]], and [[bronopol]].

In San Francisco they board a [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental]] train to New York, encountering a number of obstacles along the way: a massive herd of [[bison]] crossing the tracks, a failing [[suspension bridge]], and the train being attacked by [[Sioux]] warriors. After uncoupling the locomotive from the carriages, Passepartout is kidnapped by the Indians, but Fogg rescues him after American soldiers volunteer to help. They continue by a [[land sailing|wind powered]] [[sledge]] to [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], where they get a train to New York.

In New York, having missed the ship ''China,'' Fogg looks for alternative transport. He finds a steamboat, the ''Henrietta,'' destined for [[Bordeaux, France]]. The captain of the boat refuses to take the company to Liverpool, whereupon Fogg consents to be taken to Bordeaux for $2,000 ($207,540 in 2017) per passenger. He then bribes the crew to [[mutiny]] and make course for Liverpool. Against hurricane winds and going on full steam, the boat runs out of fuel after a few days. Fogg buys the boat from the captain and has the crew burn all the wooden parts to keep up the steam.

The companions arrive at [[Cobh|Queenstown]] (Cobh), Ireland, take the train to [[Dublin]] and then a ferry to [[Liverpool]], still in time to reach London before the deadline. Once on English soil, Fix produces a warrant and arrests Fogg. A short time later, the misunderstanding is cleared up – the actual robber, an individual named James Strand, had been caught three days earlier in [[Edinburgh]]. However, Fogg has missed the train and arrives in London five minutes late, certain he has lost the wager.

The following day Fogg apologises to Aouda for bringing her with him, since he now has to live in poverty and cannot support her. Aouda confesses that she loves him and asks him to marry her. As Passepartout notifies a minister, he learns that he is mistaken in the date – it is not 22 December, but instead 21 December. Because the party had travelled eastward, their days were shortened by four minutes for each of the 360 degrees of longitude they crossed; thus, although they had experienced the same amount of time abroad as people had experienced in London, they had seen 80 sunrises and sunsets while London had seen only 79. Passepartout informs Fogg of his mistake, and Fogg hurries to the Reform Club just in time to meet his deadline and win the wager. Having spent almost £19,000 of his travel money during the journey, he divides the remainder between Passepartout and Fix and marries Aouda.

==Background and analysis==
''Around the World in Eighty Days'' was written during difficult times, both for France and for Verne. It was during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871) in which Verne was conscripted as a coastguard; he was having financial difficulties (his previous works were not paid royalties); his father had died recently; and he had witnessed a public execution, which had disturbed him.&lt;ref name=butcher&gt;William Butcher (translation and introduction). ''Around the World in Eighty Days,'' [[Oxford Worlds Classics]], 1995, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all this, Verne was excited about his work on the new book, the idea of which came to him one afternoon in a Paris café while reading a newspaper.

The technological innovations of the 19th century had opened the possibility of rapid circumnavigation and the prospect fascinated Verne and his readership.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; In particular, three technological breakthroughs occurred in 1869–70 that made a tourist-like around-the-world journey possible for the first time: the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in America (1869), the [[History of rail transport in India|linking of the Indian railways]] across the sub-continent (1870), and the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] (1869).&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; It was another notable mark in the end of an age of exploration and the start of an age of fully global tourism that could be enjoyed in relative comfort and safety. It sparked the imagination that anyone could sit down, draw up a schedule, buy tickets and travel around the world, a feat previously reserved for only the most heroic and hardy of adventurers.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt;

Verne's works began receiving more serious reviews in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with new translations appearing.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Post-Colonial readings of the novel elucidate Verne's role as propagandist for European global dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Tussing, Exploring Cultural Reflections Through Jules Verne's Around The World In Eighty Days [ Master's Thesis, Purdue University, 2010] p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Verne's novel, one of the most widely read of the 19th century, played a major role in shaping European attitudes of the colonized lands.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The closing date of the novel, 21 December 1872, was the same date as the serial publication.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; As it was being published serially for the first time, some readers believed that the journey was actually taking place – bets were placed, and some railway companies and ship liner companies lobbied Verne to appear in the book.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; It is unknown if Verne submitted to their requests, but the descriptions of some rail and shipping lines{{which|date=February 2020}} leave some suspicion he was influenced.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt;

Although a journey by balloon has become one of the images most strongly associated with the story, it does not appear in the book – the idea is proposed in Chapter 32, but dismissed, as it &quot;would have been highly risky and, in any case, impossible.&quot; However, the 1956 movie adaptation ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' used the balloon idea, and it has now become a part of the mythology of the story, even appearing on book covers. This plot element is reminiscent of Verne's earlier ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon]],'' which first made him a well-known author.

Concerning the final ''coup de théâtre'', Fogg had thought it was one day later than it actually was, because he had forgotten that during his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rate of an hour per fifteen degrees of longitude crossed. At the time of publication and until 1884, a ''de jure'' [[International Date Line]] did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware of the change in date once he reached this line. Thus, the day he added to his clock throughout his journey would be removed upon crossing this imaginary line. However, in the real world, Fogg's mistake would not have occurred because a ''de facto'' date line did exist. The UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times. He would have noticed, when he arrived in San Francisco, that the local date was actually one day earlier than shown in his travel diary. As a consequence, it is unlikely he would fail to notice that the departure dates of the transcontinental train in San Francisco and of the China steamer in New York were actually one day earlier than his personal travel diary. He would also somehow have to avoid looking at any newspapers. Additionally, in ''Who Betrays Elizabeth Bennet?'', [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] points out that Fogg and company would have to be &quot;deaf, dumb and blind&quot; not to notice how busy the streets were on an apparent &quot;Sunday&quot;, with the [[Sunday Observance Act 1780]] still in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sOCvpTNDhiUC&amp;q=john+sutherland+fogg+sunday&amp;pg=PA213|title=Who Betrays Elizabeth Bennet?: Further Puzzles in Classic Fiction|first1=John|last1=Sutherland|first2=Lord Northcliffe Professor of Modern English Literature John|last2=Sutherland|date=March 21, 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192838841|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real-life imitations==
Following publication in 1873, various people attempted to follow Fogg's fictional circumnavigation, often within self-imposed constraints:
* In 1889, [[Nellie Bly]] undertook to travel around the world in 80 days for her newspaper, the ''[[New York World]]''. She managed to do the journey within 72 days, meeting Verne in Amiens. Her book ''[[Around the World in Seventy-Two Days]]'' became a best seller.
* In 1903, [[James Willis Sayre]], a Seattle theatre critic and arts promoter, set a world record for circling the earth using public transport: 54 days, 9 hours, and 42 minutes.
* In 1908, [[Harry Bensley]], on a wager, set out to circumnavigate the world on foot wearing an iron mask. The journey was abandoned, incomplete, at the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914.
* In 1928, 15-year-old Danish [[Boy Scout]] [[Palle Huld]] traveled around the world by train and ship in the opposite direction to the one in the book. His trip was sponsored by a Danish [[newspaper]] and made on the occasion of the 100th birthday of [[Jules Verne]]. The trip was described in the book ''[[A Boy Scout Around the World]]''. It took 44 days. He took the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and did not go by [[India]].
* In 1984, [[Nicholas Coleridge]] emulated Fogg's trip, taking 78 days, He wrote a book titled ''Around the World in 78 Days.''
* In 1988, [[Monty Python]] member [[Michael Palin]] took on a similar challenge without using aircraft, as a part of a television [[Travel literature|travelogue]], called ''[[Around the World in 80 Days with Michael Palin]].'' He completed the journey in 79 days and 7 hours.
* Since 1993, the [[Jules Verne Trophy]] has been given to the boat that sails around the world without stopping and with no outside assistance, in the shortest time.
* In 2009, twelve celebrities performed a [[Around the World in 80 Days (2009 TV series)|relay version of the journey]] for the BBC ''[[Children in Need]]'' charity appeal.
*In 2017, [[Mark Beaumont (cyclist)|Mark Beaumont]], a British cyclist inspired by Verne, set out to cycle across the world in 80 days. He completed the trip in 78 days, 14 hours and 40 minutes, after departing from Paris on 2 July 2017.  Beaumont beat the previous world record of 123 days, set by Andrew Nicholson, by cycling 18,000 miles across the globe visiting Russia, Mongolia, China, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, US and a number of countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artemisworldcycle.com/|title=Mark Beaumont's Around the World in 80 Days {{!}} Artemis World Cycle|website=www.artemisworldcycle.com|access-date=2019-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The idea of a trip around the world within a set period had clear external origins and was popular before Verne published his book in 1873. Even the title ''Around the World in Eighty Days'' is not original. Several sources&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; have been hypothesized as the origins of the story.

Greek traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (c. 100 AD) wrote a work that was translated into French in 1797 as ''Voyage autour du monde'' (&quot;Around the World&quot;).

Another early reference comes from the Italian traveler Giovanni Francesco [[Gemelli Careri]]. He wrote a book in 1699 that was translated into French: Voyage around the World or ''Voyage du Tour du Monde'' (1719, Paris).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Careri|first1=Giovanni Francesco Gemelli|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1AGAAAAQAAJ|title=Voyage du Tour du Monde (1719, Paris)|last2=Noble|first2=Eustache Le|year=1719}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel documents his trip as one of the first Europeans to circle the world for pleasure rather than profit, using publicly available transportation. [[Gemelli Careri]] provides rich accounts of seventeenth-century civilization outside of Europe. These include [[Persia]] during the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Hindustan]] during the reign of [[Aurungzebe]], the Chinese [[Lantern Festival]] and the [[Great Wall]], and the native people of [[Meso-America]]. References to his books can be found in other historical publications like the ''[[Calcutta Review]]''.

Verne's friend [[Jacques Arago]] had written a very popular ''Voyage autour du monde'' in 1853.

In 1869–70 the idea of travelling around the world reached critical popular attention when three geographical breakthroughs occurred: the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in America (1869), the [[History of rail transport in India|linking of the Indian railways]] across the sub-continent (1870), and the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] (1869).

In 1871 appeared ''Around the World by Steam, via Pacific Railway,'' published by the [[Union Pacific Railroad Company]], and an ''Around the World in A Hundred and Twenty Days'' by [[Edmond Planchut]]. In early 1870, the [[Erie Railway Company]] published a statement of routes, times, and distances detailing a trip around the globe of 23,739 miles in seventy-seven days and twenty-one hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;newspaper_reference&quot;&gt;''The Kansas Daily Tribune,'' February 5, 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[William Perry Fogg]] traveled the world, describing his tour in a series of letters to ''[[The Plain Dealer|The Cleveland Leader]] newspaper'', entitled, ''Round the World: Letters from Japan, China, India, and Egypt'' (1872).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Kern, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Co7ipk-yOs0C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq ''The Culture of Time and Space, 1880-1918: With a New Preface''], Harvard University Press (2003) - Google Books pg. 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce E. Chaplin, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F2wTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;dq ''Round About the Earth: Circumnavigation from Magellan to Orbit''], Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks (2012) - Google Books pg. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, [[Thomas Cook]] organised the first around-the-world tourist trip, leaving on 20 September 1872 and returning seven months later. The journey was described in a series of letters that were published in 1873 as ''Letter from the Sea and from Foreign Lands, Descriptive of a tour Round the World.'' Scholars have pointed out similarities between Verne's account and Cook's letters, although some argue that Cook's trip happened too late to influence Verne.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; Verne, according to a second-hand 1898 account, refers to a Cook advertisement as a source for the idea of his book.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; In interviews in 1894 and 1904, Verne says the source was &quot;through reading one day in a Paris cafe&quot; and &quot;due merely to a tourist advertisement seen by chance in the columns of a newspaper.&quot;&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; ''Around the World'' itself says the origins were a newspaper article. All of these point to Cook's advert as being a probable spark for the idea of the book.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt;

The periodical ''Le Tour du monde'' (3 October 1869) contained a short piece titled &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, which refers to &quot;140 miles&quot; of railway not yet completed between Allahabad and Bombay, a central point in Verne's work.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; But even the ''Le Tour de monde'' article was not entirely original; it cites in its bibliography the ''Nouvelles Annales des Voyages, de la Géographie, de l'Histoire et de l'Archéologie'' (August, 1869), which also contains the title ''Around the World in Eighty Days'' in its contents page.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; The ''Nouvelles Annales'' were written by [[Conrad Malte-Brun]] (1775–1826) and his son [[Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun]] (1816–1889).&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; Scholars{{Who|date=March 2017}} believe that Verne was aware of the ''Le Tour de monde'' article, the ''Nouvelles Annales,'' or both, and that he consulted it and/or them, noting that the ''Le Tour du monde'' even included a trip schedule very similar to Verne's final version.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt;

A possible inspiration was the traveller [[George Francis Train]], who made four trips around the world, including one in 80 days in 1870. Similarities include the hiring of a private train and being imprisoned. Train later claimed, &quot;Verne stole my thunder. I'm Phileas Fogg.&quot;&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt;

[[File:Verne Denoument.jpg|thumb|The book page containing the famous ''dénouement'' (page 312 in the Philadelphia – Porter &amp; Coates, 1873 edition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://truescans.com/index-Verne-2.htm |title=TrueScans of Around the World in Eighty Days; Philadelphia – Porter &amp; Coates, 1873 |publisher=Truescans.com |access-date=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Regarding the idea of gaining a day, Verne said of its origin: &quot;I have a great number of scientific odds and ends in my head. It was thus that, when, one day in a Paris café, I read in the ''Siècle'' that a man could travel around the world in 80 days, it immediately struck me that I could profit by a difference of meridian and make my traveller gain or lose a day in his journey. There was a [[dénouement]] ready found. The story was not written until long after. I carry ideas about in my head for years – ten, or 15 years, sometimes – before giving them form.&quot;&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; In his April 1873 lecture, &quot;The Meridians and the Calendar&quot;, Verne responded to a question about where the change of day actually occurred, since the [[international date line]] had only become current in 1880 and the Greenwich prime meridian was not adopted internationally until 1884.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; Verne cited an 1872 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]],'' and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story &quot;Three Sundays in a Week&quot; (1841), which was also based on going around the world and the difference in a day linked to a marriage at the end.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt; Verne even analysed Poe's story in his ''Edgar Poe and His Works'' (1864). Poe's story &quot;Three Sundays in a Week&quot; was clearly the inspiration for the lost day plot device.&lt;ref name=butcher/&gt;

'''''McDonald's Corporation v Steel &amp; Morris''''' [1997] EWHC QB 366, known as &quot;the '''McLibel case'''&quot;, was an English [[lawsuit]] for [[libel]] filed by [[McDonald's|McDonald's Corporation]] against [[environmentalism|environmental]] activists [[Helen Steel]] and David Morris (often referred to as &quot;The McLibel Two&quot;) over a factsheet critical of the company. Each of two [[hearing (law)|hearings]] in English courts found some of the leaflet's contested claims to be libellous and others to be true.

The original case lasted nearly ten years which, according to the [[BBC]], made it the longest-running libel case in English history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=McLibel pair get police payout | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/820786.stm | date=5 July 2000}} {{cite news  | title='McLibel' pair in fresh court bid | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3632944.stm | date=7 September 2004}} {{cite news  | title=McLibel: Longest case in English history | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4266741.stm | date=15 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's announced it did not plan to collect the £40,000 it was awarded by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McDonald's lets McLibel case rest |publisher=AP |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071997/biz_mclibel.html |date=19 July 1997 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006063257/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071997/biz_mclibel.html |archive-date=6 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the decision, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled in ''Steel &amp; Morris v United Kingdom'' the pair had been denied a fair trial, in breach of Article 6 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (right to a fair trial) and their conduct should have been protected by Article 10 of the Convention, which protects the right to freedom of expression. The court awarded a judgement of £57,000 against the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;Press release issued by the Registrar. &quot;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=801399&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Chamber Judgment Steel and Morris v. The United Kingdom]&quot; The [[European Court of Human Rights]], 15 February 2005. Received 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's itself was not involved in, or a party to, this action, as applications to the ECHR are independent cases filed against the relevant [[Sovereign state|state]].

[[Franny Armstrong]] and [[Ken Loach]] made a documentary film, ''[[McLibel (film)|McLibel]]'', about the case.

{{Main|London Greenpeace|Helen Steel}}
[[Helen Steel]] and David Morris were two [[environmentalists|environmental]] activists of [[London Greenpeace]], a small environmental campaigning group that existed between 1972 and 2001. In 1986, they co-authored a six-page leaflet titled ''&quot;What's wrong with McDonald's: everything they don't want you to know&quot;'' of which they distributed &quot;a few hundred copies&quot; in [[Strand, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/16/foodanddrink|title=20-year fight ends with libel law in the dock|date=16 February 2005|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/mclibel-leaflet-police-bob-lambert-mcdonalds

===Libel charges===
In 1990, McDonald's brought [[Slander and libel|libel]] proceedings against five London Greenpeace supporters, Paul Gravett, Andrew Clarke and Jonathan O'Farrell, as well as Steel and Morris, for distributing the sheet on the streets of London. This case followed past instances in which McDonald's threatened to sue more than fifty organisations for libel, including [[Channel 4]] television and several major publications. In all such cases, the media outlets [[Settlement (litigation)|settled]] and apologised.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Over the past 15 years, McDonald's has threatened legal action against more than 90 organisations in the U.K., including the [[BBC]], [[Channel 4]], the ''Guardian'', ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', the [[Scottish TUC]], the New Leaf Shop, student newspapers, and a children's theatre group. Even [[Prince Philip]] received a stiff letter. All of them backed down and many formally apologised in court.&quot; from &quot;Why Won't British TV Show a Film about McLibel?&quot;, Franny Armstrong, 19 June 1998, ''[[The Guardian]]''; as quoted in ''No Logo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[English defamation law]] at the time, the defendant had to show that each disparaging statement made is substantively true. This could be an expensive and time-consuming process. Gravett, Clarke and O'Farrell apologised as requested by McDonald's, but Steel and Morris chose to defend the case.&lt;ref&gt;Skau, S. (2013) McLibel. followthethings.com (www.followthethings.com/mclibel.shtml) Accessed 16 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two were denied [[Legal Aid]], as was policy for libel cases, despite having limited income.&lt;ref name=&quot;jobs&quot;&gt;&quot;For 313 days in court - the longest trial in English history - an unemployed postal worker (Morris) and a community gardener (Steel) went to war with chief executives from the largest food empire in the world.&quot; pg 389 of ''No Logo''&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, they had to represent themselves, though they received significant [[pro bono]] assistance, including from [[Keir Starmer]]. Steel and Morris called 180 witnesses, seeking to prove their assertions about [[food poisoning]], unpaid [[overtime]], misleading claims about how much McDonald's [[recycling|recycled]], and &quot;corporate spies sent to infiltrate the ranks of London Greenpeace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;pg 389 of ''No Logo''&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's spent several million pounds, while Steel and Morris spent £30,000; this disparity in funds meant Steel and Morris were not able to call all the witnesses they wanted, especially witnesses from South America who were intended to support their claims about McDonald's activities in that continent's rainforests.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;McLibel film, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In its libel allegation, McDonald's asserted all claims in the pamphlet to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/pretrial/state%27o%27claim.html |title=Statement of Claim |publisher=Mcspotlight.org |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found it difficult to support this position despite the indirectness of some of the claims. The case eventually became a [[media circus]]. McDonald's executives, including Ray Cesca, entered the witness box, enabling cross-examination by the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vidal|first=john|title=McLibel: British Culture on Trial|url=https://archive.org/details/mclibelburgercul00vida|url-access=registration|publisher=The New Press|date=1997|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mclibelburgercul00vida/page/11 11–20]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1995 McDonald's offered to settle the case (which &quot;was coming up to its [tenth] anniversary in court&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;&gt;pg 387 of ''No Logo'', 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt;) by donating a large sum of money to a charity chosen by the two. They further specified they would drop the case if Steel and Morris agreed to &quot;stop criticising McDonald's&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;/&gt; Steel and Morris secretly recorded the meeting, in which McDonald's said the pair could criticise McDonald's privately to friends but must cease talking to the media or distributing leaflets. Steel and Morris wrote a letter in response saying they would agree to the terms if McDonald's ceased advertising its products and instead only recommended the restaurant privately to friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

===Judgment===

====High Court====
The case was adjudicated by the Hon. Mr. Justice Rodger Bell.&lt;ref&gt;Bell J had never tried or appeared as counsel in a libel case. His practice had been primarily criminal law and professional negligence, and some felt that he was &quot;led&quot; by Richard Rampton QC, for McDonald's, throughout most of the case.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 1997, Bell J delivered his more than 1,000-page judgment largely in favour of McDonald's, finding the claims that McDonald's was responsible for starvation and deforestation were false and libellous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j379/mcdonalds_190697.htm |title=The Court Service - Queens Bench Division - Judgment - McDonald's Corporation &amp; McDonald's Restaurants Limited against Helen Marie Steel &amp; David Morris |publisher=Hmcourts-service.gov.uk |accessdate=13 November 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605062408/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j379/mcdonalds_190697.htm |archive-date = 5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling was summarized by a 45-page paper read in court.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On 19 June 1997, the judge finally handed down the verdict....It felt like an eternity to most of us sitting there, as Mr Justice Rodger Bell read out his forty-five-page ruling - a summary of the actual verdict, which was over a thousand pages long. Although the judge deemed most of the factsheet's claims too hyperbolic to be acceptable (he was particularly unconvinced by its direct linking of McDonald's to &quot;hunger in the 'Third World'&quot;), he deemed others to be based on pure fact.&quot; pg 389-390 of ''No Logo''.&lt;/ref&gt; Steel and Morris were found liable on several points, but the judge also found some of the points in the factsheet were true.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; McDonald's considered this a legal victory, though it was tempered by the judge's endorsement of some of the allegations in the sheet. Specifically, Bell J ruled that McDonald's endangered the [[health]] of their workers and customers by &quot;misleading advertising&quot;, that they &quot;exploit children&quot;, that they were &quot;culpably responsible&quot; in the infliction of unnecessary [[cruelty to animals]], and they were &quot;antipathetic&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/verdict10_sum.html |title=SUMMARY OF THE JUDGEMENT / Employment practices |accessdate=26 May 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824121253/http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/verdict10_sum.html |archive-date=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Trade union|unionisation]] and paid their workers low wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/quotes.html |date= 19 June 1997 |title= Judgement Day Verdict - Highlights |publisher = McSpotlight |accessdate = 14 July 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608203254/http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/quotes.html |archive-date=8 June 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although the decision awarded £60,000 to the company, McDonald's legal costs were much greater, and the defendants lacked the funds to pay it. Steel and Morris immediately appealed against the decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC payout&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/820786.stm |title=McLibel pair get police payout |first=BBC |last=News |accessdate=12 May 2007 | date=5 July 2000 |author-link=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 a documentary film was made about the case, also titled [[McLibel (film)|''McLibel'']]. This was updated in 2005 after the verdict of the final appeal.

In September 1998, the pair sued the [[Metropolitan Police]] for disclosing confidential information to investigators hired by McDonald's and received £10,000 and an apology for the alleged disclosure.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC payout&quot; /&gt;

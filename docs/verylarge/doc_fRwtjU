=== Filming ===
[[File:Culzean Castle 32.jpg|alt=Culzean Castle|thumb|Culzean Castle]]
The film was produced at a time of crisis for the British film industry. The studio in charge of production, British Lion Films, was in financial trouble and was bought by wealthy businessman John Bentley. To convince the [[Trade union|unions]] that he was not about to [[Asset stripping|asset-strip]] the company, Bentley needed to get a film into production quickly. This meant that ''The Wicker Man'', a film set during spring, actually began filming in October 1972: artificial leaves and blossoms had to be glued to trees in many scenes. The production was kept on a small budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;stevephilips&quot; /&gt; Christopher Lee was extremely keen to get the film made; he and others worked on the production without pay.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;!-- I think Christopher Lee mentions this on the DVD commentary. But I've definitely heard it in interviews before. --&gt; While filming took place, British Lion was bought by [[EMI Films]].

The film was shot almost entirely in the small Scottish towns of Gatehouse of Fleet, [[Newton Stewart]], [[Kirkcudbright]], and [[Creetown]] in [[Galloway]] as well as [[Plockton]] in [[Ross-shire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where was 'The Wicker Man' filmed?|url=http://www.british-film-locations.com/The-Wicker-Man-1973|website=British Film Locations|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scenes were filmed in and around the [[Isle of Whithorn]], where the owners of the castle, Elizabeth McAdam McLaughland and David Wheatley, plus several other local people, featured in various scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wicker-man.com/locations_isleofwhithorn.php |title=The Wicker Man |publisher=The Wicker Man |accessdate=2012-12-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226202756/http://www.wicker-man.com/locations_isleofwhithorn.php |archivedate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Culzean Castle]] in [[Ayrshire]] and its grounds and Floors Castle were also used for the shooting. Some of the opening flying shoots feature the [[Isle of Skye]], including the pinnacles of [[The Storr]] and the [[Quiraing]]. The cave scenes were filmed inside [[Wookey Hole Caves|Wookey Hole]] in Somerset. The amphibious aircraft that carries Sergeant Howie was a [[Thurston Teal]], owned and flown in the aerial sequences by Christopher Murphy. The climax of the film was shot on the clifftops at [[Burrow Head]]. According to Britt Ekland, some animals perished in the Wicker Man,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreviewer.com/travel-guides/film-locations/summerisle-the-wicker-man/57289/ |title=Summerisle (The Wicker Man) |publisher=World Reviewer |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Robin Hardy said in an interview that great care was taken to ensure that the animals were in no danger of being hurt during this scene and that they were not inside the Wicker Man when it was set on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/interviews/39/robin_hardy.html|title=Robin Hardy – Burning the Man – The director of ''The Wicker Man'' talks about the film's enduring appeal|author=Unsworth, Cathi|magazine=Fortean Times|date=April 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303070803/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/interviews/39/robin_hardy.html|archivedate=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:The Wicker Man burns - geograph.org.uk - 50168.jpg|thumb|upright|Wickerman Festival, Dundrennan, Scotland, burning of the effigy]]
The film's soundtrack often forms a major component of the narrative, just as with other important [[arthouse]] films of the era such as [[Donald Cammell]] and [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/20063|title=10 of the Most Underrated Horror Scores!|author=Sean H. Stewart|publisher=BloodyDisgusting|date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Songs accompany many important scenes, such as the plane's arrival, Willow's dancing, the maypole dance, the girls jumping through fire, the search of the houses, the procession, and the final burning scene. Indeed, according to Seamus Flannery in a subsequent documentary, director Robin Hardy surprised the cast by suddenly announcing midway through filming that they were making a &quot;musical&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Composed, arranged, and recorded by [[Paul Giovanni]], and performed by [[Magnet (band)|Magnet]] (in some versions of the film credited as &quot;Lodestone&quot;), the soundtrack contains 13 folk songs performed by characters in the film. Included are traditional songs, original compositions by Giovanni, and even a nursery rhyme, &quot;[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep (nursery rhyme)|Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]&quot;.

&quot;[[Willow's Song]]&quot; has been covered or sampled by various rock music bands. It was first covered by the English musical project known as [[Nature and Organisation]] on their 1994 release 'Beauty Reaps the Blood of Solitude'. It was covered by [[Sneaker Pimps]] as &quot;How Do&quot;, and is included on their 1996 release ''Becoming X''. &quot;How Do&quot; can be heard in the movie ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' (2005); the song is incorrectly credited in the end titles as being composed by Sneaker Pimps. Additionally, the band has covered &quot;Gently Johnny&quot; as &quot;Johnny&quot;; it is featured as a B-side on their single &quot;Roll On&quot; (1996). It also was covered by [[Faith and the Muse]] on their 2003 album ''[[The Burning Season (album)|The Burning Season]]'', and [[The Mock Turtles]] on their album ''[[Turtle Soup]]''.

The songs on the soundtrack were composed or arranged by Giovanni under the direction of Hardy and Shaffer, whose research into the oral folk tradition in England and Scotland was based largely on the work of [[Cecil Sharp]], a 'founding father' of the folk-revival movement of the early 20th century. Using Sharp's collections as a template, Shaffer noted to Giovanni which scenes were to have music, and in some cases provided lyrics which would be appropriate to spring pagan festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartholomew|first=David|date=1977|title=The Wicker Man|url=http://www.wicker-man.com/articles/cinefantastique_TWM_article_1977.pdf|journal=Cinefantastique|volume=6 |issue=3|pages=22|via=Wayback Machine|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314113156/http://www.wicker-man.com/articles/cinefantastique_TWM_article_1977.pdf|archivedate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs on the soundtrack come from a later folk tradition, for example, &quot;Corn Riggs&quot;, by Scotland's national bard, Robert Burns, accompanies Howie's arrival on Summerisle. The lyrics of this song were taken directly from the Burns song &quot;The Rigs of Barley&quot;, but Giovanni used a very different tune. Burns' tune was based on &quot;Corn Riggs&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Scots Musical Museum, Volume 1, song 94. Publisher: James Johnson &amp; Co, Edinburgh, 1771&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.nls.uk/87794929|title=Scots musical museum: Volume 1|website=National Library of Scotland|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and altered to match his lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoszNAGmPuQ|title=Ossian - Corn Rigs (with lyrics)|last=DmKrispin|date=11 August 2011|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=July 2017}} The song sung by the cultists of Summerisle at the end of the film, &quot;Sumer Is Icumen In&quot;, is a mid-13th-century song about nature in spring.

The [[Wickerman Festival]] was an annual music festival held near [[Dundrennan|Auchencairn]] in Galloway.  Dubbed &quot;Scotland's Alternative Music festival&quot; It began in 2001 when the festival's artistic director Sid Ambrose hit upon the idea of a local counter-culture based family-friendly festival due to the surrounding area being inextricably linked with various locations used within The Wicker Man. It was held annually until 2015 at East Kirkcarswell Farm, Dundrennan.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: THERE ARE NUMEROUS RUMORS AND MYTHS ABOUT THE FILM'S VARIOUS RUNNING LENGTHS. PLEASE REVIEW PHILIPS AND KERMODE BEFORE CHANGING THIS SECTION. IF YOU ADD RUNNING TIME INFORMATION THAT IS UNCITED, IT CAN BE REVERTED. --&gt;

By the time of the film's completion the studio had been bought by EMI, and British Lion was managed by [[Michael Deeley]]. The DVD commentary track states that studio executives suggested a more &quot;upbeat&quot; ending to the film, in which a sudden rain puts the flames of the wicker man out and spares Howie's life, but this suggestion was refused. Hardy subsequently had to remove about 20&amp;nbsp;minutes of scenes on the mainland, early investigations, and (to Lee's disappointment) some of Lord Summerisle's initial meeting with Howie.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===Original release===
The first screening of the film was to trade and cinema distributors on 3 December 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://artandhue.com/wicker |title = ''The Wicker Man'' | website = Art &amp; Hue presents The Wicker Man}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public theatrical release was a week of test screenings at the Metropole Cinema London on 6 December 1973 ahead of the official public release in January 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://artandhue.com/wicker |title = ''The Wicker Man'' | website = Art &amp; Hue presents The Wicker Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs 87 minutes.

A copy of a finished, 99-minute version&lt;ref name=&quot;markkermode&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Kermode |first=Mark |url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/feature.jsp?id=111049 |title=Something Wicker This Way Comes |work=Channel4 |accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was sent to American [[film producer]] [[Roger Corman]] in [[Hollywood]] to make a judgment of how to market the film in the US. Corman recommended an additional 13&amp;nbsp;minutes be cut from the film. (Corman did not acquire US release rights, and eventually [[Warner Bros.]] test-marketed the film in drive-ins.) In Britain, the film was ordered reduced to roughly 87&amp;nbsp;minutes, with some narrative restructuring, and released as the [[B-movie|&quot;B&quot; picture]] on a double bill with ''[[Don't Look Now]]''. According to Lee, the cuts adversely affected the film's [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].

===First restoration===
During the mid-1970s, Hardy made inquiries about the film, hoping to restore it to his original vision. Along with Lee and Shaffer, Hardy searched for his original cut, or raw footage. Both of these appeared to have been lost. Cult film director [[Alex Cox]] said in his ''[[Moviedrome]]'' introduction in 1988 that the negative had &quot;ended up in the pylons that support the [[M4 motorway (Great Britain)|M4 motorway]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;alexcox&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Cox |first=Alex |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8IGJjukTzc |title=Moviedrome – Wicker Man – Alex Cox intro |work=YouTube |accessdate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy recalled that a copy of the film made prior to Deeley's cuts was sent to Corman, who, it turned out, still had a copy, possibly the only existing print of Hardy's original cut. The US rights had been sold by Warner Bros. to a small firm called Abraxas, managed by film buff Stirling Smith and critic John Alan Simon. Stirling agreed to an American release of a reconstruction by Hardy. Hardy restored the narrative structure, some of the erotic elements which had been excised, and a very brief pre-title segment of Howie on the mainland (appearing at a church with his fiancée). A 96-minute restored version was released in January 1979,&lt;ref name=&quot;stevephilips&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The various versions of ''The Wicker Man'' | last=Philips |first=Steve |work=Steve's Web Page |year=2002 |url=http://steve-p.org/wm/ |accessdate=11 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; again to critical acclaim.

===US VHS version===
Strangely, the original 99-minute version was available in the US on VHS home video from Media Home Entertainment (and later Magnum) during the 1980s and 1990s.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=September 2017}} This video includes additional early scenes set inside Howie's police station which Hardy had left out of the 1979 restoration.

===Director's cut===
In 2001, the film's new world rights owners, [[Canal+ Group|Canal+]], tried to release the full-length film. Corman's copy had been lost but a [[telecine]] transfer to 1-inch videotape existed. Missing elements were combined with film elements from the previous versions (in particular, additional scenes of Howie on the mainland were restored, showing him to be the object of gossip at his police station, establishing his devout religiosity). The extended DVD cut was released by Canal+ ([[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] handling US DVD distribution) in this 95-minute hybrid, considered the longest and closest version to Hardy's original 99-minute version.&lt;ref name=&quot;stevephilips&quot; /&gt; A two-disc limited edition set was sold with the shortened theatrical release, the new extended version and a documentary, ''The Wicker Man Enigma''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wickermanenigma&quot;&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0307667 |title=The Wicker Man Enigma |description=2001 documentary on the film's production and releases. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''Inside The Wicker Man'' author Allan Brown revealed he had discovered stills taken on the set showing sequences from the script that had never been seen; it had never been certain that the scenes had been filmed. They include scenes where Howie closes a mainland pub open after hours, encounters a prostitute, has a massage from Willow McGregor and sees a brutal confrontation between Oak and a villager in The Green Man, which were featured in a revised edition of ''Inside The Wicker Man''. Anchor Bay released a limited edition wooden box of ''The Wicker Man''. Fifty thousand two-disc sets were made, of which twenty were signed by Lee and Woodward, Shaffer, Snell and Hardy. In June 2007, Lee discussed the lost original cut, &quot;I still believe it exists somewhere, in [[film can|cans]] with no name. I still believe that. But nobody's ever seen it since, so we couldn't re-cut it, re-edit it, which was what I wanted to do. It would have been ten times as good&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M39giPEjE6Y|title=Christopher Lee talks about The Wicker Man|author=Lee, Christopher|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=21 March 2002|accessdate=9 April 2012|author-link=Christopher Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Final Cut''===
European distributors of the film StudioCanal began a Facebook campaign in 2013 to find missing material, which culminated in the discovery of a 92-minute 35mm print at the Harvard Film Archive. This print had previously been known as the &quot;Middle Version&quot; and was itself assembled from a 35mm print of the original edit Robin Hardy had made in the United Kingdom in 1973, but which was never released.&lt;ref name=&quot;cinemaretro1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/7569-RESTORED-VERSION-OF-THE-WICKER-MAN-TO-BE-RELEASED-IN-UK-THEATRES.html |title=RESTORED VERSION OF &quot;THE WICKER MAN&quot; TO BE RELEASED IN UK THEATRES - Celebrating Films of the 1960s &amp; 1970s |publisher=Cinemaretro.com |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Hardy believes that the original edit will probably never be found, saying, &quot;Sadly, it seems as though this has been lost forever. However, I am delighted that a 1979 [[Abraxas]] print has been found as I also put together this cut myself, and it crucially restores the story order to that which I had originally intended.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cinemaretro1&quot;/&gt;

===Novelisation===
A [[novelization|novelisation]] which expanded on the story and [[The Wicker Man (novel)|bearing the same title]], was released in 1978. It was written by Hardy and Shaffer.

===Possible sequel===
In 1989, Shaffer wrote a thirty-page film [[Film treatment|script treatment]] entitled ''The Loathsome Lambton Worm'', a direct sequel to ''The Wicker Man'', for producer Lance Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthonyshaffer.co.uk/unproduced.html|title=Unproduced|publisher=AnthonyShaffer.co.uk|accessdate=9 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513191756/http://www.anthonyshaffer.co.uk/unproduced.html|archivedate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have been more [[fantasy film|fantastical]] in subject matter than the original film, and relied more heavily on [[special effect]]s. In this continuation of the story, which begins immediately after the ending of the first film, Sergeant Neil Howie is rescued from the burning Wicker Man by a group of police officers from the mainland. Howie sets out to bring Lord Summerisle and his pagan followers to justice,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Wicker Man : Part 2&quot;/&gt; but becomes embroiled in a series of challenges which pit the old gods against his own Christian faith. The script culminates in a climactic battle between Howie and a fire-breathing [[dragon]] – the titular [[Lambton Worm]] – and ends with a suicidal Howie plunging to his death from a cliff while tied to two large [[eagle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/6745-REVIEW-THE-WICKER-TREE-COMES-TO-DVD-AND-BLU-RAY.html|title=Review : &quot;The Wicker Tree comes to DVD and Blu-ray - Celebrating Films of the 1960s &amp; 1970s|author=Smith, Adrian|publisher=Cinema Retro|date=12 May 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaffer's sequel was never produced, but his treatment, complete with illustrations, was eventually published in the companion book ''Inside The Wicker Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotswhayhae.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/wicker-man-revisited.html|title=Wicker Man Revisited...|publisher=Scots Whay Hae!|date=28 August 2010|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy was not asked to direct the sequel, and never read the script, as he did not like the idea of Howie surviving the sacrifice, or the fact that the actors would have aged by twenty to thirty years between the two films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/stephen-applebaum/robin-hardy-wicker-man-the-director-of-cult-clas_1_b_1415898.html|title=The Director of Cult Classic The Wicker Man Returns With the Wicker Tree - Interview With Robin Hardy|author=Applebaum, Stephen|work=Huffington Post|date=12 April 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, Hardy discussed ''The Loathsome Lambton Worm''. &quot;I know Tony did write that, but I don't think anyone particularly liked it, or it would have been made.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=807:robin-hardy-grows-the-wicker-tree&amp;catid=36:demo-articles&amp;Itemid=56|title=Robin Hardy Grows &quot;THE WICKER TREE&quot;|author=Gingold, Michael|magazine=Fangoria|date=9 May 2010|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[fan labor|fan-made]] full-cast [[radio drama|audio drama]] adaptation of Shaffer's ''The Loathsome Lambton Worm'' treatment was eventually released in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ourculturemag.com/2019/06/14/audio-drama-sequel-to-the-wicker-man-in-production/|title=Audio-Drama Sequel to The Wicker Man in Production |author=Stewardson, Christopher|publisher=Our Culture|date=14 June 2019|accessdate=24 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remake===
An [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[remake]] [[The Wicker Man (2006 film)|of the same name]], starring [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Ellen Burstyn]], and directed by [[Neil LaBute]] was released in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Wicker Man 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt.tcm.turner.com/tcmdb/title/641977/Wicker-Man-The/full-credits.html|title=The Wicker Man 2006|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|location=[[Atlanta]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy expressed concern about the remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pendreigh |first=Brian |title=Wicker Man director is flaming furious over Hollywood remake |url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/heritage/Wicker-Man-director-is-flaming.2660325.jp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605103607/http://heritage.scotsman.com/heritage/Wicker-Man-director-is-flaming.2660325.jp |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 June 2011 |date=11 September 2005 |accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage production===
A stage adaptation was announced for the 2009 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stv.tv/scotland/101660-edinburgh-fringe-programme-launched/ Edinburgh Fringe Programme Launched], [[Scottish Television|STV]] News, 10 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and was directed by Andrew Steggall. The production was based jointly upon Anthony Shaffer's original ''The Wicker Man'' script and David Pinner's novel ''Ritual''. Robin Hardy gave input on the project, and original songs and music from the film were supervised by [[Gary Carpenter (composer)|Gary Carpenter]], the original music director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatsonstage.com/gossip/theatre/london/E8821202473715/Wicker+Man+Set+for+Stage+Crossover%3F%3F%3F.html Wicker Man Set for Stage Crossover???], WhatsOnStage.com, 8 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080316021121/http://themotiongroup.org/wicker/ The Motion Group website], March 2008, via archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; Workshop rehearsals were held at [[The Drill Hall]] in London in March 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Brian Pendreigh, [http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/latestnews/The-Wicker-Man-and-the.3858815.jp The Wicker Man and the Showgirl], ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', 8 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and a casting call was held in Glasgow in May 2009.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} After three weeks at the [[Pleasance]] in Edinburgh in August 2009, the production was to visit the [[Perth Rep]], the [[Eden Court Theatre]] in Inverness, and then have a short run at [[Citizen's Theatre]] in Glasgow, with hopes for a run in London in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wildhunt.org/blog/2009/06/quick-note-the-wicker-man-the-musical.html The Wicker Man, The Musical] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120721073212/http://wildhunt.org/blog/2009/06/quick-note-the-wicker-man-the-musical.html |date=21 July 2012 }}, Wild Hunt blog, 11 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2009 it was announced that the production had been cancelled, three weeks before it had been due to preview.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Wicker-Man/83853841171 The Wicker Man] Facebook page, 10 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[National Theatre of Scotland]] produced ''An Appointment with the Wicker Man'' written by [[Greg Hemphill]] and Donald McCleary. The production has an amateur theatre company attempting to stage a ''Wicker Man'' musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alfred |last=Hickling |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/feb/15/wicker-man-musical-interview |title=Playing with fire: The Wicker Man musical |date=15 February 2012 |accessdate=21 February 2012 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual sequel===
In 2011, a [[spiritual successor]] entitled ''[[The Wicker Tree (film)|The Wicker Tree]]'' was released. It was directed by Hardy and featured an appearance by Lee. Hardy first published the story as a novel, under the name ''[[Cowboys for Christ]]''. First announced in April 2000, filming on the project began on 19 July 2009 according to IMDb. It follows two young American Christian [[evangelism|evangelists]] who travel to Scotland; like Woodward's character in ''The Wicker Man'', the two Americans are virgins who encounter a pagan [[laird]] and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buckley|first=Heather|title=Exclusive: A Night with The Wicker Man / The Wicker Tree Footage Premiere Report|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/34502/exclusive-a-night-with-the-wicker-man-the-wicker-tree-footage-premiere-report|publisher=DreadCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received mixed reviews.

Those involved in the production of the film have given conflicting statements regarding the identity of Christopher Lee's character, referred to only as Old Gentleman in the credits. Writer–director Robin Hardy has stated that the ambiguity was intentional. Fans would immediately recognise Lee's character as Lord Summerisle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruemorgueradio.com/RMpodcast/RM-051.mp3 |title=RM-051.mp3 (audio/mpeg Object) |author=Hardy, Robin |publisher=Rue Morgue Radio |quote=Well, it is very ambiguous. We don't really know who he is. He's an antecedent, of some kind, of Lachlan's. Lachlan remembers him, when he was a boy. There's a boy painting a bridge, and it may have been Lachlan as a young person. He's remembering this grandfather figure, or this great-grandfather figure – whatever – who the people who are fans of ''The Wicker Man'' and the wicker ''[inaudible]'', if you like, will of course immediately recognise as Summerisle. But we don't give him a name or anything. I think in the credits he's just called the old man. |accessdate=12 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520175938/http://ruemorgueradio.com/RMpodcast/RM-051.mp3 |archivedate=20 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee himself has contradicted this, stating that the two are not meant to be the same character, and that ''The Wicker Tree'' is not a sequel in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Christopher|title=Christopher Lee 2011 Christmas Message Part 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0r1d7uE4-E|quote=The first one that I can think of is ''The Wicker Tree'', in which I make a very brief appearance.

===Potential graphic novel and third film===
As a former artist, Hardy expressed great interest in the medium of [[comic]]s, and planned a [[graphic novel]] which would retell the story of ''The Wicker Man'', based on his own storyboards for the film. Hardy was in talks with yet unnamed artists to work on the project, as he found it too difficult to make the characters look consistent from one panel to the next. Hardy was working on his next film, ''The Wrath of the Gods'', at the time of his death on 1 July 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Wicker Man : Part 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthonyshaffer.co.uk/screenplays/thewickerman%202.html|title=The Wicker Man : Part 2|publisher=AnthonyShaffer.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930205605/http://www.anthonyshaffer.co.uk/screenplays/thewickerman%202.html|archivedate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/interviewsnews.php?id=20305|title=Exclusive Interview: Wicker Tree's Robin Hardy|author=Turek, Ryan|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=3 August 2011|accessdate=8 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414185106/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/interviewsnews.php?id=20305|archivedate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He intended the graphic novel and the new film to be released at the same time in autumn 2013; however as of autumn 2014 neither had been released, and the film never started production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/187271-paganism-is-in-christianity-director-robin-hardy-on-the-wicker-tree|title=Paganism is in Christianity: Robin Hardy on 'The Wicker Tree'|author=Ashby, Devon|publisher=CraveOnline|date=23 April 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427234655/http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/187271-paganism-is-in-christianity-director-robin-hardy-on-the-wicker-tree|archivedate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter [[multiple citizenship]], most countries require that applicants for naturalization renounce any other citizenship that they currently hold, but whether this renunciation actually causes [[loss of citizenship|loss of original citizenship]], as seen by the host country and by the original country, will depend on the laws of the countries involved.

The massive increase in population flux due to [[globalization]] and the sharp increase in the numbers of [[refugee]]s following [[World War I]] created many [[stateless person]]s, people who were not citizens of any state. In some rare cases, laws for mass naturalization were passed. As naturalization laws had been designed to cater for the relatively few people who had voluntarily moved from one country to another (expatriates), many western democracies were not ready to naturalize large numbers of people. This included the massive influx of stateless people which followed massive denationalizations and the expulsion of [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] from newly created [[nation states]] in the first part of the 20th century, but they also included the mostly [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] [[History of Russia|Russians]] who had escaped the 1917 [[October Revolution]] and the [[war communism]] period, and then the [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish refugees]]. As [[Hannah Arendt]] pointed out, [[internment camps]] became the &quot;only nation&quot; of such stateless people, since they were often considered &quot;undesirable&quot; and were stuck in an illegal situation, wherein their country had expelled them or deprived them of their nationality, while they had not been naturalized, thus living in a judicial [[no man's land]].

Since [[World War II]], the increase in [[Human migration|international migrations]] created a new category of migrants, most of them [[economic migrants]]. For economic, political, humanitarian and pragmatic reasons, many states passed laws allowing a person to acquire their citizenship after birth, such as by marriage to a national – ''[[jus matrimonii]]'' – or by having ancestors who are nationals of that country, in order to reduce the scope of this category. However, in some countries this system still maintains a large part of the immigrant population in an illegal status, albeit with some massive regularizations, for example, in Spain by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero|José Luis Zapatero]]'s government and in Italy by [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]]'s government.

The ''Australian Citizenship Act 1973'' ended the preferential treatment for British subjects from 1 December 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Citizenship Amendment Act 1984'' removed Part II of the ''Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948'', effective 1 May 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; People who became permanent residents from 1 July 2007 must have been lawfully resident in Australia for four years before applying for citizenship by conferral.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/citizenship/become-a-citizen/permanent-resident#Eligibility|title=Become an Australian citizen (by conferral): Permanent residents or New Zealand citizens|website=Australian Government.

===People's Republic of China===
{{Main|Nationality law of the People's Republic of China}}

The [[China|People's Republic of China]] gives citizenship to people with one or two parents with Chinese nationality who have not taken residence in other countries. The country also gives citizenship to people born on its territory to [[statelessness|stateless people]] who have settled there. Furthermore, individuals may apply for nationality if they have a near relative with Chinese nationality, if they have settled in China, or if they present another legitimate reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/immigration/chinese/law.htm Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China], GovHK.hk&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, few people gain Chinese citizenship; as of 2010, China had only 1,448 naturalised Chinese in total.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21710264-worlds-rising-superpower-has-particular-vision-ethnicity-and-nationhood-has Who is Chinese?

The naturalization process starts with a written application. Applicants must submit three copies, written with a ball-point or fountain pen, to national authorities, and to provincial authorities in the Ministry of Public Security and the Public Security Bureau. Applicants must also submit original copies of a foreign passport, a residence permit, a permanent residence permit, and four two-and-a-half inch long pictures. According to the conditions outlined in the [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]], authorities may also require &quot;any other material that the authority believes are related to the nationality application&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enghengyang.gov.cn/showdetail.aspx?typeid=&amp;newsid=1394 &quot;Guide and Instructions of Naturalization of Chinese Nationality&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522164847/http://www.enghengyang.gov.cn/showdetail.aspx?typeid=&amp;newsid=1394 |date=2012-05-22 }}, Hengyang, China website&lt;/ref&gt;

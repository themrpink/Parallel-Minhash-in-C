===Participation and barriers===
Participation is involvement in life situations and everyday activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot; /&gt; Participation includes self-care, productivity, and leisure. In fact, communication, mobility, education, home life, leisure and social relationships require participation, and indicate the extent to which children function in their environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot; /&gt; Barriers can exist on three levels: micro, meso and macro.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aitchison&quot; /&gt; First, the barriers at the micro level involve the person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aitchison&quot; /&gt; Barriers at the micro level include the child's physical limitations (motor, sensory and cognitive impairments) or their subjective feelings regarding their ability to participate.&lt;ref name=&quot;imms_2008&quot; /&gt; For example, the child may not participate in group activities due to lack of confidence. Second, barriers at the meso level include the family and community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aitchison&quot; /&gt; These may include negative attitudes of people toward disability or lack of support within the family or in the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Specht&quot; /&gt; One of the main reasons for this limited support appears to be the result of a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding the child's ability to engage in activities despite his or her disability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Specht&quot; /&gt; Third, barriers at the macro level incorporate the systems and policies that are not in place or hinder children with CP. These may be environmental barriers to participation such as architectural barriers, lack of relevant assistive technology and transportation difficulties due to limited wheelchair access or public transit that can accommodate children with CP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Specht&quot; /&gt; For example, a building without an elevator can prevent the child from accessing higher floors.

A 2013 review stated that outcomes for adults with cerebral palsy without intellectual disability in the 2000s were that &quot;60–80% completed high school, 14–25% completed college, up to 61% were living independently in the community, 25–55% were competitively employed, and 14–28% were involved in long term relationships with partners or had established families&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frisch|first1=Dana|last2=Msall|first2=Michael E.|title=Health, functioning, and participation of adolescents and adults with cerebral palsy: A review of outcomes research|journal=[[Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews]]|date=August 2013|volume=18|issue=1|pages=84–94|doi=10.1002/ddrr.1131|pmid= 23949832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults with cerebral palsy may not seek physical therapy due to transport issues, financial restrictions and practitioners not feeling like they know enough about cerebral palsy to take people with CP on as clients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence2016&quot; /&gt;

A study in [[young adult (psychology)|young adults]] (18–34) on transitioning to adulthood found that their concerns were physical health care and understanding their bodies, being able to navigate and use services and supports successfully, and dealing with prejudices. A feeling of being &quot;thrust into adulthood&quot; was common in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bagatell|first1=Nancy|last2=Chan|first2=Dara|last3=Rauch|first3=Kimberly Karrat|last4=Thorpe|first4=Deborah|title=&quot;Thrust into adulthood&quot;: Transition experiences of young adults with cerebral palsy|journal=Disability and Health Journal|date=January 2017|volume=10|issue=1|pages=80–86|doi=10.1016/j.dhjo.2016.09.008|pmid=27756560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aging===
Children with CP may not successfully transition into using adult services because they are not referred to one upon turning 18, and may decrease their use of services.&lt;ref name=&quot;rehabilitation443&quot; /&gt; Because children with cerebral palsy are often told that it is a non-progressive disease, they may be unprepared for the greater effects of the [[aging]] process as they head into their 30s.&lt;ref&gt;Turk, M.A., Overeynder, J.C., &amp; Janicki, M.P.

Like they did in childhood, adults with cerebral palsy experience psychosocial issues related to their CP, chiefly the need for social support, self-acceptance, and acceptance by others. Workplace accommodations may be needed to enhance continued employment for adults with CP as they age. Rehabilitation or social programs that include [[salutogenesis]] may improve the coping potential of adults with CP as they age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horsman|first1=M.|last2=Suto|first2=M.|last3=Dudgeon|first3=B.|last4=Harris|first4=S.

==Epidemiology==
Cerebral palsy occurs in about 2.1 per 1000 live births.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osk2013&quot; /&gt; In those born at term rates are lower at 1 per 1000 live births.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yar2013&quot; /&gt; Rates appear to be similar in both the developing and developed world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yar2013&quot; /&gt; Within a population it may occur more often in poorer people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odding|first1=E|last2=Roebroeck|first2=ME|last3=Stam|first3=HJ|title=The epidemiology of cerebral palsy: incidence, impairments and risk factors.|journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|date=28 February 2006|volume=28|issue=4|pages=183–91|pmid=16467053|doi=10.1080/09638280500158422|s2cid=45640254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate is higher in males than in females; in Europe it is 1.3 times more common in males.&lt;ref name=&quot;JohnsonPrevalence&quot; /&gt;

There was a &quot;moderate, but significant&quot; rise in the prevalence of CP between the 1970s and 1990s. This is thought to be due to a rise in [[low birth weight]] of infants and the increased survival rate of these infants. The increased survival rate of infants with CP in the 1970s and 80s may be indirectly due to the [[disability rights movement]] challenging perspectives around the worth of infants with disability, as well as the [[Baby Doe Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalembert|first1=George|last2=Brosco|first2=Jeffrey P.|title=Do Politics Affect Prevalence? An Overview and the Case of Cerebral Palsy|journal=[[Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics]]|date=June 2013|volume=34|issue=5|pages=369–374|doi=10.1097/DBP.0b013e31829455d8|pmid=23751888|s2cid=41883040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, advances in care of pregnant mothers and their babies has not resulted in a noticeable decrease in CP. This is generally attributed to medical advances in areas related to the care of premature babies (which results in a greater survival rate). Only the introduction of quality medical care to locations with less-than-adequate medical care has shown any decreases. The incidence of CP increases with premature or very low-weight babies regardless of the quality of care.&lt;ref name=&quot;bax_2005&quot; /&gt; {{as of|2016}}, there is a suggestion that both incidence and severity are slightly decreasing – more research is needed to find out if this is significant, and if so, which interventions are effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shepherd et al 2016&quot; /&gt;

Prevalence of cerebral palsy is best calculated around the school entry age of about 6&amp;nbsp;years, the prevalence in the U.S. is estimated to be 2.4 out of 1000 children.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17261678&quot; /&gt;

==History==
Cerebral palsy has affected humans since antiquity.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; A decorated grave marker dating from around the 15th to 14th century BCE shows a figure with one small leg and using a crutch, possibly due to cerebral palsy.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; The oldest likely physical evidence of the condition comes from the mummy of [[Siptah]], an Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] who ruled from about 1196 to 1190&amp;nbsp;BCE and died at about 20 years of age.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; The presence of cerebral palsy has been suspected due to his deformed foot and hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt;

The medical literature of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] discusses paralysis and weakness of the arms and legs; the modern word ''palsy'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''παράλυση'' or ''πάρεση'', meaning paralysis or paresis respectively.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; The [[Hippocratic Corpus|works of the school of Hippocrates]] (460{{endash}}c. 370&amp;nbsp;BCE), and the manuscript ''On the Sacred Disease'' in particular, describe a group of problems that matches up very well with the modern understanding of cerebral palsy.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; The Roman Emperor [[Claudius]] (10 BCE{{endash}}54 CE) is suspected of having CP, as historical records describe him as having several physical problems in line with the condition. Medical historians have begun to suspect and find depictions of CP in much later art.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Several paintings from the 16th century and later show individuals with problems consistent with it, such as [[Jusepe de Ribera]]'s 1642 painting ''[[The Clubfoot]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt;

The modern understanding of CP as resulting from problems within the brain began in the early decades of the 1800s with a number of publications on brain abnormalities by [[Johann Christian Reil]], [[Claude François Lallemand]] and [[Philippe Pinel]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Later physicians used this research to connect problems in the brain with specific symptoms.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; The English surgeon [[William John Little]] (1810{{endash}}1894) was the first person to study CP extensively.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; In his doctoral thesis he stated that CP was a result of a problem around the time of birth.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; He later identified a difficult delivery, a [[preterm birth]] and [[perinatal asphyxia]] in particular as risk factors.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; The [[spastic diplegia]] form of CP came to be known as Little's disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; At around this time, a German surgeon was also working on cerebral palsy, and distinguished it from polio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Definition and Classification of Cerebral Palsy|journal=[[Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology]]|date=28 June 2008|volume=49|pages=1–44|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2007.00201.x|s2cid=221645066}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s British neurologist [[William Gowers (neurologist)|William Gowers]] built on Little's work by linking paralysis in newborns to difficult births.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=History2013/ --&gt; He named the problem &quot;birth palsy&quot; and classified birth palsies into two types: peripheral and cerebral.&lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt;

Working in Pennsylvania in the 1880s, Canadian-born physician [[William Osler]] (1849{{endash}}1919) reviewed dozens of CP cases to further classify the disorders by the site of the problems on the body and by the underlying cause.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Osler made further observations tying problems around the time of delivery with CP, and concluded that problems causing bleeding inside the brain were likely the root cause.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Osler also suspected polioencephalitis as an infectious cause.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Through the 1890s, scientists commonly confused CP with [[Poliomyelitis|polio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt;

Before moving to psychiatry, Austrian neurologist [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856{{endash}}1939) made further refinements to the classification of the disorder. He produced the system still being used today.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Freud's system divides the causes of the disorder into problems present at birth, problems that develop during birth, and problems after birth.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Freud also made a rough correlation between the location of the problem inside the brain and the location of the affected limbs on the body, and documented the many kinds of movement disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt;

In the early 20th century, the attention of the medical community generally turned away from CP until orthopedic surgeon Winthrop Phelps became the first physician to treat the disorder.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; He viewed CP from a [[musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] perspective instead of a neurological one.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Phelps developed surgical techniques for operating on the muscles to address issues such as spasticity and muscle rigidity.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Hungarian [[physical rehabilitation]] practitioner [[András Pető]] developed a system to teach children with CP how to walk and perform other basic movements.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Pető's system became the foundation for [[conductive education]], widely used for children with CP today.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=History2013/ --&gt; Through the remaining decades, physical therapy for CP has evolved, and has become a core component of the CP management program.&lt;ref name=&quot;History2013&quot; /&gt;

In 1997, Robert Palisano ''et al.'' introduced the [[Gross Motor Function Classification System]] (GMFCS) as an improvement over the previous rough assessment of limitation as either mild, moderate or severe.&lt;ref name=&quot;rethlefsen_2010&quot; /&gt; The GMFCS grades limitation based on observed proficiency in specific basic mobility skills such as sitting, standing and walking, and takes into account the level of dependency on aids such as wheelchairs or walkers. The GMFCS was further revised and expanded in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;rethlefsen_2010&quot; /&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Economic impact===
It is difficult to directly compare the cost and cost-effectiveness of interventions to prevent cerebral palsy or the cost of interventions to manage CP.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid29319155&quot; /&gt; Access Economics has released a report on the economic impact of cerebral palsy in Australia. The report found that, in 2007, the financial cost of cerebral palsy (CP) in Australia was $AUS 1.47&amp;nbsp;billion or 0.14% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;spasticcentre&quot; /&gt; Of this:
* $AUS 1.03 billion (69.9%) was productivity lost due to lower employment, absenteeism and premature death of Australians with CP
* $AUS 141 million (9.6%) was the DWL from transfers including welfare payments and taxation forgone
* $AUS 131 million (9.0%) was other indirect costs such as direct program services, aides and home modifications and the bringing-forward of funeral costs
* $AUS 129 million (8.8%) was the value of the informal care for people with CP
* $AUS 40 million (2.8%) was direct health system expenditure

The value of lost well-being (disability and premature death) was a further $AUS 2.4&amp;nbsp;billion.

In per capita terms, this amounts to a financial cost of $AUS 43,431 per person with CP per annum. Including the value of lost well-being, the cost is over $115,000 per person per annum.

Individuals with CP bear 37% of the financial costs, and their families and friends bear a further 6%. Federal government bears around one-third (33%) of the financial costs (mainly through taxation revenues forgone and welfare payments). State governments bear under 1% of the costs, while employers bear 5% and the rest of society bears the remaining 19%. If the burden of disease (lost well-being) is included, individuals bear 76% of the costs.

The average lifetime cost for people with CP in the US is $US921,000 per individual, including lost income.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14749614&quot; /&gt;

In the United States many states allow [[Medicaid]] beneficiaries to use their Medicaid funds to hire their own PCAs, instead of forcing them to use institutional or managed care.&lt;ref name=&quot;medicaid&quot; /&gt;

In India, the government-sponsored program called &quot;NIRAMAYA&quot; for the medical care of children with neurological and muscular deformities has proved to be an ameliorating economic measure for persons with such disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIRAMAYA Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE)|url=http://thenationaltrust.gov.in/content/scheme/niramaya.php|website=thenationaltrust.gov.in|access-date=27 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150225/http://thenationaltrust.gov.in/content/scheme/niramaya.php|archive-date=27 February 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has shown that persons with mental or physically debilitating congenital disabilities can lead better lives if they have financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=V|first1=MEERA SIVA, NALINAKANTHI|title=Financially able|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/financially-able/article7930167.ece|work=The Hindu Business Line|date=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of the term===
&quot;Cerebral&quot; means &quot;of, or pertaining to, the cerebrum or the brain&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11113 | title=Definition of Cerebral}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;palsy&quot; means &quot;paralysis, generally partial, whereby a local body area is incapable of voluntary movement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.medicinenet.com/facial_nerve_problems/article.htm | title=Bell's Palsy (Facial Nerve Problems): Symptoms, Treatment &amp; Contagious}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been proposed to change the name to &quot;cerebral palsy spectrum disorder&quot; to reflect the diversity of presentations of CP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shevell |first1=Michael |title=Cerebral palsy to cerebral palsy spectrum disorder : Time for a name change? |journal=[[Neurology (journal)|Neurology]] |date=19 December 2018 |pages=10.1212/WNL.0000000000006747 |pmid=30568002 |doi=10.1212/WNL.0000000000006747|s2cid=58605985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people would rather be referred to as a person with a disability ([[people-first language]]) instead of as handicapped. &quot;Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care&quot; at the [[University of Delaware]] offers the following guidelines:

{{quote|Impairment is the correct term to use to define a deviation from normal, such as not being able to make a muscle move or not being able to control an unwanted movement. Disability is the term used to define a restriction in the ability to perform a normal activity of daily living which someone of the same age is able to perform. For example, a three-year-old child who is not able to walk has a disability because a normal three-year-old can walk independently. A handicapped child or adult is one who, because of the disability, is unable to achieve the normal role in society commensurate with his age and socio-cultural milieu. As an example, a sixteen-year-old who is unable to prepare his own meal or care for his own toilet or hygiene needs is handicapped. On the other hand, a sixteen-year-old who can walk only with the assistance of crutches but who attends a regular school and is fully independent in activities of daily living is disabled but not handicapped. All disabled people are impaired, and all handicapped people are disabled, but a person can be impaired and not necessarily be disabled, and a person can be disabled without being handicapped.&lt;ref name=&quot;udel&quot; /&gt;}}

The term &quot;[[spastic]]&quot; denotes the attribute of spasticity in types of spastic CP. In 1952 a UK charity called The Spastics Society was formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian20020522&quot; /&gt; The term &quot;spastics&quot; was used by the charity as a term for people with CP. The word &quot;spastic&quot; has since been used extensively as a general insult to disabled people, which some see as extremely offensive. They are also frequently used to insult able-bodied people when they seem overly uncoordinated, anxious, or unskilled in sports. The charity changed its name to [[Scope (charity)|Scope]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian20020522&quot; /&gt; In the United States the word spaz has the same usage as an insult, but is not generally associated with CP.&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmer&quot; /&gt;

Maverick documentary filmmaker [[Kazuo Hara]] criticises the mores and customs of Japanese society in an unsentimental portrait of adults with cerebral palsy in his 1972 film ''Goodbye CP'' (Sayonara CP). Focusing on how people with cerebral palsy are generally ignored or disregarded in Japan, Hara challenges his society's taboos about physical handicaps. Using a deliberately harsh style, with grainy black-and-white photography and out-of-sync sound, Hara brings a stark realism to his subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdtalk&quot; /&gt;

''Spandan'' (2012), a film by Vegitha Reddy and Aman Tripathi, delves into the dilemma of parents whose child has cerebral palsy. While films made with children with special needs as central characters have been attempted before, the predicament of parents dealing with the stigma associated with the condition and beyond is dealt in ''Spandan''. In one of the songs of ''Spandan'' &quot;Chal chaal chaal tu bala&quot; more than 50 CP kids have acted. The famous classical singer [[Devaki Pandit]] has given her voice to the song penned by Prof. Jayant Dhupkar and composed by [[National Film Awards]] winner Isaac Thomas Kottukapally.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newsleaks&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;deccan&quot; /&gt;

''[[My Left Foot (film)|My Left Foot]]'' (1989) is a drama film directed by [[Jim Sheridan]] and starring [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]. It tells the true story of [[Christy Brown]], an Irishman born with cerebral palsy, who could control only his left foot. Christy Brown grew up in a poor, working-class family, and became a writer and artist. It won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Actor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Brenda Fricker). It was also nominated for Best Director, Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. It also won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film]] for 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot; /&gt;

''[[Call the Midwife]]'' (2012–) has featured two episodes with actor Colin Young, who he himself has cerebral palsy, playing a character with the same disability. His story lines have focused on the segregation of those with disabilities in the UK in the 1950s, and also romantic relationships between people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.scope.org.uk/2014/02/16/being-on-call-the-midwife-gave-me-the-sense-of-being-an-actor-in-my-own-right/|title=Being on Call the Midwife gave me the sense of being an actor in my own right|accessdate=12 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905210353/http://blog.scope.org.uk/2014/02/16/being-on-call-the-midwife-gave-me-the-sense-of-being-an-actor-in-my-own-right/|archivedate=5 September 2015|date=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parkinsonism''' is a clinical [[syndrome]] characterized by [[tremor]], [[bradykinesia]], [[Rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]], and [[balance disorder|postural instability]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aminoff_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Aminoff MJ, Greenberg DA, Simon RP | title = Clinical Neurology | publisher = Lange: McGraw-Hill Medical | edition = 6th | pages = 241–45 |year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-07-142360-1 |chapter= Chapter 7: Movement disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogawa T, Fujii S, Kuya K, Kitao SI, Shinohara Y, Ishibashi M, Tanabe Y |title=Role of neuroimaging on differentiation of Parkinson's disease and its related diseases |journal=Yonago Acta Med |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=145–55 |date=September 2018 |pmid=30275744 |pmc=6158357 |doi=10.33160/yam.2018.09.001|type= Review|quote= Parkinsonian syndromes are a group of movement disorders characterized by classical motor symptoms such as tremors, bradykinesia, and rigidity.

A wide range of causes may lead to this set of symptoms, including [[neurodegenerative]] conditions, drugs, [[toxin]]s, [[metabolic disease]]s, and neurological conditions other than PD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christine CW, Aminoff MJ | title = Clinical differentiation of parkinsonian syndromes: prognostic and therapeutic relevance | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 117 | issue = 6 | pages = 412–9 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15380498 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.03.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
===Drug-induced===
About 7% of people with parkinsonism developed symptoms as a result of side effects of medications, mainly neuroleptic [[antipsychotic]]s especially the [[phenothiazine]]s (such as perphenazine and [[chlorpromazine]]), [[thioxanthene]]s (such as flupenthixol and zuclopenthixol) and [[butyrophenone]]s (such as haloperidol), and rarely, antidepressants. The incidence of drug-induced parkinsonism increases with age. Drug-induced parkinsonism tends to remain at its presenting level and does not worsen like Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parkinsons.org.uk/PDF/FS38_druginducedparkinsonism.pdf | title = Information Sheet: Drug-induced Parkinsonism | publisher = Parkinson’s Disease and Society |access-date = 2013-04-15 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130626024034/http://www.parkinsons.org.uk/PDF/FS38_druginducedparkinsonism.pdf | archive-date = 2013-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toxins ===
Evidence exists of a link between exposure to pesticides and herbicides and PD; a two-fold increase in risk was seen with [[paraquat]] or [[maneb]]/[[mancozeb]] exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pezzoli2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pezzoli G, Cereda E | title = Exposure to pesticides or solvents and risk of Parkinson disease | journal = Neurology | volume = 80 | issue = 22 | pages = 2035–41 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23713084 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318294b3c8 | s2cid = 13628268 | type = Meta-analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic [[manganese]] (Mn) exposure has been shown to produce a parkinsonism-like illness characterized by movement abnormalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guilarte2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guilarte TR, Gonzales KK | title = Manganese-Induced Parkinsonism Is Not Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease: Environmental and Genetic Evidence | journal = Toxicological Sciences | volume = 146 | issue = 2 | pages = 204–12 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26220508 | pmc = 4607750 | doi = 10.1093/toxsci/kfv099 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition is not responsive to [[Management of Parkinson's disease|typical therapies used in the treatment of PD]], suggesting an alternative pathway than the typical [[dopamine]]rgic loss within the [[substantia nigra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guilarte2015&quot; /&gt; Manganese may accumulate in the [[basal ganglia]], leading to the abnormal movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kwakye2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kwakye GF, Paoliello MM, Mukhopadhyay S, Bowman AB, Aschner M | title = Manganese-Induced Parkinsonism and Parkinson's Disease: Shared and Distinguishable Features | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 7519–40 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26154659 | pmc = 4515672 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph120707519 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; A mutation of the SLC30A10 gene, a manganese efflux transporter necessary for decreasing intracellular Mn, has been linked with the development of this Parkinsonism-like disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peres2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peres TV, Schettinger MR, Chen P, Carvalho F, Avila DS, Bowman AB, Aschner M | title = Manganese-induced neurotoxicity: a review of its behavioral consequences and neuroprotective strategies | journal = BMC Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 57 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27814772 | pmc = 5097420 | doi = 10.1186/s40360-016-0099-0 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]] typical to PD are not seen in Mn-induced parkinsonism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kwakye2015&quot; /&gt;

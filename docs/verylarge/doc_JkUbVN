However, assuming he will be treated fairly by the new society, Neville stays at his house until infected members arrive and violently dispatch the undead vampires outside his house with fiendish glee. Realizing the infected attackers may intend to kill him after all, he fires on them and in turn is shot and captured. Fatally wounded, Neville is placed in a barred cell where he is visited by Ruth, who informs him that she is a senior member of the new society but, unlike the others, does not resent him. After discussing the effects of Neville's vampire-killing activities on the new society, she acknowledges the public need for Neville's execution but, out of mercy, gives him a packet of fast-acting [[suicide pill]]s. Neville accepts his fate and asks Ruth not to let this society become too heartless. Ruth promises to try, kisses him, and leaves. Neville goes to his prison window and sees the infected staring back at him with the same hatred and fear that he once felt for them; he realizes that he, a remnant of old humanity, is now a legend to the new race born of the infection. He recognizes that their desire to kill him, after he has killed so many of their loved ones, is not something he can condemn. As the pills take effect, he is amused by the thought that he will become their new superstition and legend, just as vampires once were to humans.

==Critical reception==
As related in ''[[In Search of Wonder]]'' (1956), [[Damon Knight]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Knight |first= Damon |year=1967|title=In Search of Wonder|url= https://archive.org/details/insearchofwonder0000knig |url-access= registration |location=Chicago |publisher= Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote |The book is full of good ideas, every other one of which is immediately dropped and kicked out of sight.  The characters are child's drawings, as blank-eyed and expressionless as the author himself in his back-cover photograph. The plot limps.  All the same, the story could have been an admirable minor work in the tradition of ''[[Dracula]]'', if only the author, or somebody, had not insisted on encumbering it with the year's most childish set of 'scientific' rationalizations.}}

[[Galaxy Science Fiction|''Galaxy'']] reviewer [[Groff Conklin]] described ''Legend'' as &quot;a weird [and] rather slow-moving first novel... a horrid, violent, sometimes exciting but too often overdone tour de force.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf&quot;, ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', January 1955, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Boucher]] praised the novel, saying &quot;Matheson has added a new variant on the Last Man theme... and has given striking vigor to his invention by a forceful style of storytelling which derives from the best hard-boiled crime novels&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Recommended Reading,&quot; ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction|F&amp;SF]]'', November 1954, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dan Schneider (writer)|Dan Schneider]] from ''International Writers Magazine: Book Review'' wrote in 2005:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackwriters.com/iamlegend.htm |title=I am Legend by Richard Matheson |last=Schneider |first=Dan |publisher= Hackwriters |date=1953-01-05 |accessdate= 2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote | despite having vampires in it, [the novel] is not a novel on vampires, nor even a horror nor sci-fi novel at all, in the deepest sense. Instead, it is perhaps the greatest novel written on human loneliness. It far surpasses [[Daniel Defoe]]’s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' in that regard. Its insights into what it is to be human go far beyond genre, and is all the more surprising because, having read his short stories—which range from competent but simplistic, to having classic ''[[The Twilight Zone|Twilight Zone]]'' twists (he was a major contributor to the original TV series)—there is nothing within those short stories that suggests the supreme majesty of the existential masterpiece ''I Am Legend'' was aborning.}}

In 2012, the [[Horror Writers Association]] gave ''I Am Legend'' the special Vampire Novel of the Century Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | work = Horror | URL = http://www.horror.org/blog/?p=2453 | title = 2011 Bram Stoker Award™ winners and Vampire Novel of the Century Award winner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Although Matheson calls the assailants in his novel &quot;vampires&quot; and though their condition is transmitted through bacteria in the blood and garlic is a repellant to this strain of bacteria, there is little similarity between them and vampires as developed by [[John William Polidori]] and his successors, who come straight out of the [[gothic fiction]] tradition.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In ''I Am Legend'', the &quot;vampires&quot; share more similarities with zombies, and the novel influenced the [[zombie]] genre and popularized the concept of a worldwide [[zombie apocalypse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;&gt;Deborah Christie, Sarah Juliet Lauro, ed.

Fordham Univ Press. p. 169. {{ISBN|0-8232-3447-9}}, 9780823234479.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the idea has now become commonplace, a scientific origin for vampirism or zombies was fairly original when written.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071228040501/http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071223%2FSTYLE%2F225372455%2F-1%2Fstyle &quot;Nashuatelegraph.com: Tale with long history has legendary opening&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Clasen,

{{Quote|''I Am Legend'' is the product of an anxious artistic mind working in an anxious cultural climate. However, it is also a playful take on an old archetype, the vampire (the reader is even treated to Neville’s reading and put-down of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''). Matheson goes to great lengths to rationalize or naturalize the vampire myth, transplanting the monster from the otherworldly realms of folklore and Victorian supernaturalism to the test tube of medical inquiry and rational causation. With ''I Am Legend'', Matheson instituted the germ theory of vampirism, a take on the old archetype which has since been tackled by other writers (notably, [[Dan Simmons]] in ''Children of the Night'' from 1992).&lt;ref name=&quot;Clasen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clasen|first=Mathias|year=2010|title=Vampire Apocalypse: A Biocultural Critique of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v034/34.2.clasen.html|work=Philosophy and Literature|doi=10.1353/phl.2010.0005|volume=34|issue=2|pages=313–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though referred to as &quot;the first modern vampire novel&quot;, it is as a novel of social theme that ''I Am Legend'' made a lasting impression on the cinematic zombie genre, by way of [[film director|director]] [[George A. Romero]], who acknowledged its influence and that of its 1964 adaptation, ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'', upon his seminal film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;David Carroll and Kyla Ward, [http://www.tabula-rasa.info/DarkAges/Timeline2.html &quot;''The Horror Timeline''&quot;] Burnt Toast No. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houseofhorrors.com/night68.htm &quot;House of Horrors Presents: ''The Night of the Living Dead''&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/02/13/retrospective-night-of-the-living-dead-1968 &quot;Steve Biodrowski, ''Retrospective: Night of the Living Dead (1968)''&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Matheson Interview, in Tom Weaver, ''Return of the B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers: The Mutant Melding of Two Volumes of Classic Interviews'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 1999), p. 307, {{ISBN|0-7864-0755-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the creation of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Romero remarked, &quot;I had written a short story, which I basically had ripped off from a Richard Matheson novel called ''I Am Legend''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;One for the Fire: The Legacy of ''Night of the Living Dead''&quot;—''Night of the Living Dead'' DVD, 2008, Region 1, ''Dimension Home Entertainment''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, film critics noted similarities between ''Night of the Living Dead'' (1968) and ''The Last Man on Earth'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;[http://notcoming.com/reviews.php?id=688 &quot;Thomas Scalzo, ''The Last Man on Earth'' (Film Review)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen King]] said, &quot;Books like ''I Am Legend'' were an inspiration to me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,923-2278832,00.html |work=The Times |location=London |title=The Legend that inspired me |date=2006-07-22 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics noted that the [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British film]] ''[[28 Days Later]]'' (2002) and its sequel ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' both feature a [[rabies]]-type [[Plague (disease)|plague]] ravaging [[Great Britain]], analogous to ''I Am Legend''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=109016 &quot;28 Days Later Movie Review (2002)].

Tim Cain, the [[Video game producer|producer]], [[lead programmer]] and one of the main [[Video game designer|designers]] of the 1997 [[computer game]] ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This book was how a [sic] individual would handle thinking that he was the last survivor on Earth. This is why in ''Fallout 1'' when you're voted to leave the Vault, we really wanted that sense of isolationism; that sense of: You are the only person out here on the Wasteland who is, quote, &quot;a normal person&quot;, and we wanted you to feel, like, special in that way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GameSpot|title=Fallout Classic Revisited|date=2012-03-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa5IzHhAdi4&amp;t=8m21s|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Adaptations==
===Comics===
&lt;!-- [[Richard Matheson's I Am Legend]] links here --&gt;
The book has also been adapted into a [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] titled ''Richard Matheson's I Am Legend'' by [[Steve Niles]] and Elman Brown. It was published in 1991 by [[Eclipse Comics]] and collected into a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] by [[IDW Publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id=22085|title=I Am Legend}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=11626|title=I Am Legend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unrelated film tie-in was released in 2007 as a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''I Am Legend: Awakening'' published in a [[San Diego Comic-Con]] special by [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=150975|title=I Am Legend: Awakening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audiobook===
A nine-part abridged reading of the novel performed by [[Angus MacInnes]] was originally broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC Radio 7]] in January 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/i/i_/i_am_legend.html |title=BBC Radio 7—I Am Legend |publisher=Radiolistings.co.uk |accessdate=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated in January 2018.

===Films===
''I Am Legend'' has been adapted into a feature-length film three times, as well as into a direct-to-video feature film called ''[[I Am Omega]]''. Differing from the book, each of them portrays the Neville character as an accomplished scientist. The three adaptations show him finding a remedy and passing it on. Adaptations differ from the novel by setting the events three years after the disaster, instead of happening “in the span of” three years. Also adaptations are set in the near future, a few years after the film's release, while the novel is set 20 years after its publication date.

It has also been adapted as the Spanish short student film ''Soy leyenda''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soy&quot;&gt;{{imdb title|title=Soy leyenda|id=tt0149027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Last Man on Earth''====
{{Main|The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)}}
In [[1964 in film|1964]], [[Vincent Price]] starred as Dr. Robert Morgan (rather than &quot;Neville&quot;) in ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' (the original title of this [[Italy|Italian]] production was ''L'ultimo uomo della Terra''). Matheson wrote the original screenplay for this adaptation, but due to later rewrites did not wish his name to appear in the credits; as a result, Matheson is credited under the pseudonym &quot;Logan Swanson&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WiaterBradley2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stan Wiater|author2=Matthew R. Bradley|author3=Paul Stuve|title=The Twilight and Other Zones: The Dark Worlds of Richard Matheson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLsunUB90q4C&amp;pg=PA176|accessdate=3 June 2013|year=2009|publisher=Kensington Publishing Corporation|isbn=978-0-8065-3113-7|pages=177–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Omega Man''====
{{Main|The Omega Man}}
In [[1971 in film|1971]], a far different version was produced, titled ''[[The Omega Man]]''. It starred [[Charlton Heston]] (as Robert Neville) and [[Anthony Zerbe]]. Matheson had no influence on the screenplay for this film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/omega_man_the |title=Omega Man, The |publisher=Sf-encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although the premise remains, it deviates from the novel in several ways, removing the infected people's vampiric characteristics, except their sensitivity to light. In this version, the infected are portrayed as nocturnal, black-robed, [[Albinism|albino]] mutants, known as the Family. Though intelligent, they eschew modern technology, believing it (and those who use it, such as Neville) to be evil and the cause of humanity's downfall.

====''I Am Legend''====
{{Main|I Am Legend (film)}}
In 2007, a third adaptation of the novel was produced, this time titled ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]''. Directed by [[Francis Lawrence]] and starring [[Will Smith]] as Robert Neville, this film uses both Matheson's novel and the 1971 ''Omega Man'' film as its sources.&lt;ref&gt;end credits: &quot;Based on the screenplay by John &amp; Joyce Corrington, and the novel by Richard Matheson&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation also deviates significantly from the novel. In this version, the infection is caused by a virus originally intended to cure [[cancer]]. Some vampiric elements are retained, such as sensitivity to [[Ultraviolet|UV light]] and attraction to blood. The infected are portrayed as nocturnal, feral creatures of limited intelligence who hunt the uninfected with [[berserker]]-like rage. Other creatures, such as dogs, are also infected by the virus. The ending of the film was also altered to portray Neville as sacrificing his life to save humanity, rather than being executed for crimes against the surviving vampiric humans, although a deleted ending for the film was closer in spirit to the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The film takes place in New York City in 2009 and 2012 rather than Los Angeles in 1975–1977.

'''Dennis Nicolaas Maria Bergkamp''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈdɛnəs ˈbɛrxkɑmp|-|Nl-Dennis Bergkamp.ogg}}; born 10 May 1969) is a Dutch professional [[Association football|football]] coach and former [[Football player|player]]. Originally a [[Midfielder#Winger|wide midfielder]], Bergkamp was moved to main [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] and then to [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]], where he remained throughout his playing career. Nicknamed the &quot;Non-[[Flying Dutchman]]&quot; by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] supporters due to his [[fear of flying]], Bergkamp is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation.

The son of an electrician, Bergkamp was born in [[Amsterdam]] and played as an amateur in the lower leagues. He was spotted by [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] at age 11 and made his professional debut in 1986. Prolific form led to an international call-up with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] a year later, attracting the attention of several European clubs. Bergkamp signed for Italian club [[Inter Milan]] in 1993, where he had two underwhelming seasons. After joining Arsenal in 1995, he rejuvenated his career, helping the club to win three [[Premier League]] titles, four [[FA Cup]] trophies, and reach the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]], which marked his last appearance as a player. Despite noting a desire to not go into coaching, Berkgamp served as an assistant at Ajax between 2011 and 2017.

With the Netherlands national team, Bergkamp was selected for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], where he impressed, scoring three goals as his country reached the semi-finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; At the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], he scored a memorable winning goal in the final minute of the quarterfinal against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] which has been regarded as one of the greatest [[FIFA World Cup]] goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Bergkamp surpassed [[Faas Wilkes]]'s record to become the country's top scorer of all time in 1998, a record later eclipsed by [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]], and [[Robin van Persie]].

Bergkamp has been described by [[Jan Mulder (footballer)|Jan Mulder]] as having &quot;the finest technique&quot; of any Dutch international&lt;ref name=&quot;Burgcamp&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/017c244e-d6da-11da-b64c-0000779e2340.html#axzz1tS5U1MZp|title=No more walking in a 'Burgcamp' Wonderland|last=Kuper|first=Simon|date=28 April 2006|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a &quot;dream for a striker&quot; by teammate [[Thierry Henry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Indy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/there-was-only-one-dennis-bergkamp-408838.html|title=There was only one Dennis Bergkamp|last=Coleman|first=Nick|date=22 July 2006|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=13 December 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergkamp finished third twice in the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award and was selected by [[Pelé]] as one of the [[FIFA 100]] greatest living players.

In 2017, Bergkamp's goal against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2002 was voted as the best Premier League goal of all-time in the league's 25-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/08/14/dennis-bergkamps-newcastle-pirouette-voted-premier-leagues-best/|title= Dennis Bergkamp's Newcastle pirouette voted best goal in 25 years of Premier League football|date=14 August 2017|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Ajax: 1986–1993===
[[File:Dennis Bergkamp 1989, Bestanddeelnr 934-4782.jpg|thumb|188x188px|Bergkamp at Ajax in 1989|left]]

Bergkamp was brought up through [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]'s youth system, joining the club at age 11.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt; Manager [[Johan Cruyff]] gave him his professional debut on 14 December 1986 against [[Roda JC Kerkrade|Roda JC]]; the match ended in a 2–0 victory for Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vi.nl/Wedstrijden/Wedstrijd.htm?dbid=59196&amp;typeofpage=84140 |title=Ajax 2–0 Roda JC |accessdate=28 April 2012 |work=Voetbal International |language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergkamp scored his first senior goal for the club against [[HFC Haarlem]] on 22 February 1987 in a match Ajax won 6–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vi.nl/Wedstrijden/Wedstrijd.htm?dbid=59197&amp;typeofpage=84140 |title=Ajax 6–0 Haarlem |accessdate=3 May 2012 |work=Voetbal International |language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to make 23 appearances in the [[1986–87 Eredivisie|1986–87 season]], including a European debut against [[Malmö FF]] in the [[1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup]], earning him praise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt; Ajax won the competition, beating [[1.

In later seasons, Bergkamp established himself as a first-team player for Ajax. This culminated in a period of success for the club, which won the [[Eredivisie]] title in the [[1989–90 Eredivisie|1989–90]] season for the first time in five years. Bergkamp scored 29 goals in 36 matches the following season and became the joint top scorer in the league, sharing the accolade with [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] striker [[Romário]].

Ajax won the [[1992 UEFA Cup Final]], beating [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] through the [[Away goals rule|away goals ruling]]. They then defeated [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]] 6–2 in the final of the [[1992–93 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] on 20 May 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1991/92: Ajax complete clean sweep |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/history/season=1991/index.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ajax – sc Heerenveen |url=http://www.sc-heerenveen.nl/voetbal/wedstrijd/ajax-sc-heerenveen/?match=15523 |work=sc-heerenveen.nl |publisher=[[SC Heerenveen]] |accessdate=11 May 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GWz9ITTe?url=http://www.sc-heerenveen.nl/voetbal/wedstrijd/ajax-sc-heerenveen/?match=15523 |archive-date=11 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergkamp was the top scorer in the Eredivisie from 1991 to 1993, and was voted [[Dutch Footballer of the Year]] in 1992 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ajax.nl/Nieuws/Nieuwsarchief/Nieuws-artikel/Deze-week-17-jaar-geleden.htm | title=Deze week&amp;nbsp;... 17 jaar geleden | work=Ajax.nl | date=11 February 2009 | accessdate=11 May 2012 | language=Dutch | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021190014/http://www.ajax.nl/Nieuws/Nieuwsarchief/Nieuws-artikel/Deze-week-17-jaar-geleden.htm | archivedate=21 October 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, he scored 122 goals in 239 matches for his hometown club.

===Inter Milan: 1993–1995===
Bergkamp attracted the attention of several European clubs as a result of his performances for Ajax. Johan Cruyff advised him not to join [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]], one of the teams said to have been interested in him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/deportes/CRUYFF/_JOHAN_/FUTBOL/HOLANDA/BERGKAMP/_DENNIS_/FUTBOLISTA/HOLANDA/FUTBOL_CLUB_BARCELONA_/CLUB_DE_FUTBOL/elpepidep/19930102elpepidep_2/Tes|title=Cruyff: &quot;¿Qué va a hacer Bergkamp en el Real Madrid?&quot; |date=2 January 1993 |accessdate=12 December 2011 |newspaper=[[El País]] |last=Carbonell |first=Rafael |language=Spanish |location=Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Bergkamp was insistent on playing in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;FourFourTwo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/one-on-one/371/article.aspx |title=Dennis Bergkamp – One-on-One – Interviews |accessdate=12 December 2011 |work=[[FourFourTwo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered [[Serie A]] &quot;the biggest league at the time&quot; and preferred a move to either [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] or [[Inter Milan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FourFourTwo&quot;/&gt; On 16 February 1993, Bergkamp agreed a £7.1&amp;nbsp;million move to the latter club in a deal which included his Ajax teammate [[Wim Jonk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Inter&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-bergkamp-joins-inter-for-71m-pounds-1473409.html|title=Football: Bergkamp joins Inter for 7.1m pounds|date=16 February 1993 |accessdate=12 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |last=Haylett |first=Trever }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon signing, Bergkamp said Inter &quot;met all my demands. The most important thing for me was the stadium, the people at the club and their style of play.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inter&quot;/&gt;

Bergkamp made his debut against [[A.C. Reggiana 1919|Reggiana]] on 29 August 1993 at the [[San Siro]] in a 2–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/agosto/30/Jonk_Toto_fanno_ridere_Inter_co_0_93083010915.shtml|title=Jonk e Toto' fanno ridere l' Inter |date=30 August 1993 |accessdate=13 December 2011 |publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]] |last=Giancarlo|first=Padovan |language=Italian |location=Milan }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club against [[U.S. Cremonese|Cremonese]] in September 1993 but had a difficult time against the highly organised and resolute Italian defences, scoring a further seven goals in the league. This was partly due to manager [[Osvaldo Bagnoli]]'s inability to find a stable forward partnership, preferring Bergkamp in a three with [[Rubén Sosa]] and [[Salvatore Schillaci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-wright-faces-charge-fa-awaits-linesmans-decision-1506224.html|title=Football: Wright faces charge: FA awaits linesman's decision|date=23 November 1993 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Winter |first=Henry |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inter's poor league form culminated in the sacking of Bagnoli in February 1994 and his replacement by [[Gianpiero Marini]], a member of [[Italy national football team|Italy]]'s [[1982 FIFA World Cup]]-winning squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19940209&amp;id=Fd9OAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3282,3220664|title=Inter sack coach Bagnoli|date=9 February 1994 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |work=[[New Straits Times]]| location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club finished 13th in [[1993–94 Serie A|Serie A]], one point away from relegation, but enjoyed success in the [[1993–94 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], beating [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Austria Salzburg]] in the [[1994 UEFA Cup Final|final]] over two legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1993/overview/index.html |title=1993/94: Inter reclaim UEFA Cup |work=UEFA.com |date=1 June 1994 |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergkamp was the competition's joint top scorer with eight goals and scored a hat-trick against [[FC Rapid București|Rapid București]] in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/settembre/17/Bergkamp_Baggio_magie_10_co_0_93091713338.shtml|title=Bergkamp Baggio, magie da 10 |date=17 September 1993 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |newspaper=Corriere della Sera |last=Gherarducci |first=Mario |language=Italian |location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bergkamp's [[1994–95 Inter Milan season|second season at Inter]], the club changed managers again, appointing [[Ottavio Bianchi]]. Bergkamp endured a disappointing campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/aebja5/remembering-the-failed-serie-a-careers-of-arsenals-invincibles-generation.html|title=Remembering The Failed Serie A Careers Of Arsenal's Invincibles Generation}}&lt;/ref&gt; troubled with stress injuries and fatigue from the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]]. He managed to score 5 goals in 26 appearances. Off the field, Bergkamp's relationship with the Italian press and fans became uncomfortable. His shy persona and his propensity to go home after matches was interpreted as apathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/unravelling-the-enigma-that-is-dennis-bergkamp-1587595.html|title=Unravelling the enigma that is Dennis Bergkamp|date=21 June 1995 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Winner |first=David |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his poor performance on the pitch, one Italian publication renamed their award given to the worst performance of the week, ''L'asino della settimana'' (Donkey of the Week) to ''Bergkamp della settimana''.&lt;ref name=&quot;FourFourTwo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2000/06/27/che-incubi-milano-il-riscatto-dei-ripudiati.html|title=Che incubi a Milano Il riscatto dei ripudiati |date=27 June 2000 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |newspaper=[[la Repubblica]] |last=Marrese |first=Emilio |language=Italian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inter ended the [[1994–95 Serie A|league season]] in sixth position and failed to retain the [[1994–95 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], with the club eliminated in the second round. In February 1995, the club was purchased by Italian businessman and fan [[Massimo Moratti]], who promised to invest heavily in the squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/accaddeoggi/2011/02/18-156431/1995,+Moratti+compra+l%27Inter |title=1995, Moratti compra l'Inter |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |publisher=[[Corriere dello Sport]] |last=Marrese |first=Emilio |language=Italian |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020340/http://www.corrieredellosport.it/accaddeoggi/2011/02/18-156431/1995,+Moratti+compra+l%27Inter |archive-date=3 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergkamp's future in the first team was uncertain following the signing of [[Maurizio Ganz]] a month after the takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/marzo/29/Ganz_primo_colpo_Moratti_co_0_95032914360.shtml|title=Ganz, il primo colpo di Moratti |date=29 March 1995 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |newspaper=Corriere della Sera |agency=BBC |language=Italian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arsenal: 1995–2006===
As Moratti prepared to make wholesale changes at the club, Bergkamp left Inter and signed with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in June 1995 for a transfer fee estimated at £7.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;arsenal&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rioch-signs-bergkamp-to-signal-new-era-1587607.html|title=Rioch signs Bergkamp to signal new era |date=21 June 1995 |accessdate=9 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Shaw |first=Phil | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became manager [[Bruce Rioch]]'s first signing at Arsenal and broke the club's transfer fee record set at £2.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;arsenal&quot;/&gt; Bergkamp's arrival at the club was significant not only because he was an established international footballer who looked to have his best years ahead of him, but also because he was a major contributor to Arsenal's return to success after much decline in the mid-1990s. On the opening day of the [[1995–96 FA Premier League|1995–96]] league season, Bergkamp made his full debut against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. He struggled to adapt to the English game and failed to score in the club's next six league matches, prompting ridicule by the national press. On 23 September 1995, Bergkamp scored his first and second goals for Arsenal against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/dennis-finds-his-menace-1602734.html|title=Dennis finds his menace |date=24 September 1995 |accessdate=9 December 2011 |work=The Independent |last=Houston |first=Bob |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergkamp ended his first season with 33 appearances and 11 goals, helping Arsenal finish fifth and earn a place in the [[1996–97 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] by scoring the winner against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on the final day of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/bergkamp-sends-arsenal-into-europe-1345860.html|title=Bergkamp sends Arsenal into Europe |date=6 May 1996 |accessdate=9 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Chesshyre |first=Tom |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of [[Arsène Wenger]] as Arsenal manager in September 1996 marked a turning point in Bergkamp's career.&lt;ref name=&quot;wenger&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/apr/25/arsenal|title=On a higher plane |date=25 April 2004 |accessdate=13 December 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Lawrence |first=Amy| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wenger, who had moderate success coaching in France and Japan, recognised Bergkamp's talent and wanted to use him as a fulcrum of the team's forward play.&lt;ref name=&quot;wenger&quot;/&gt; Both were advocates of a continental style of attacking football, and Wenger's decision to impose a strict fitness and health regimen pleased Bergkamp.&lt;ref name=&quot;wenger&quot;/&gt; Despite making fewer appearances in the [[1996–97 Arsenal F.C. season|1996–97 season]], Bergkamp was more influential in the first team, creating 13 assists. Against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in November 1996, he set up an 88th-minute winner for captain [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] to volley in using his left foot. He then scored in injury time, controlling a high ball with his left foot and evading his marker [[Stephen Carr]] in a tight area to set up his shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-bergkamp-and-adams-break-spirited-spurs-1354105.html|title=Football: Bergkamp and Adams break spirited Spurs |date=25 November 1996 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Haylett |first=Trever | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergkamp received his first [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]] against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in January 1997 for a high tackle on midfielder [[Paul Bracewell]] in the 26th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/grim-for-grizzly-adams-1282883.html|title=Grim for grizzly Adams|date=12 January 1997 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |work=The Independent |last=Turnbull |first=Simon | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal went on to lose the match 1–0, but a run of 8 wins in their final 16 matches gave the club a third-place finish, missing out on a spot in the [[1997–98 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] via goal difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-three-gunner-salute-for-baseball-ground-1261073.html|title=Football: Three Gunner salute for Baseball Ground |date=12 May 1997 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Shaw |first=Phil | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergkamp was instrumental [[1997–98 Arsenal F.C. season|the following season]] in helping Arsenal complete a domestic league and cup [[Double (association football)|double]]. He became the club's top scorer with 22 goals and recorded a strike rate of 0.57.

After an effective [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] campaign with the national team, Bergkamp had another productive season in [[1998–99 Arsenal F.C. season|1998–99]]. Although Arsenal failed to retain the [[1998–99 FA Premier League|Premier League]] after losing the title on the final day of the season to Manchester United, Bergkamp was the club's second-top scorer in all competitions, with 16 goals, and finished the season as the top assist provider in the Premier League, alongside [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]], with 13 assists.&lt;ref name=&quot;1998–99 Premier League Season&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.premierleague.com/history/1998-99 |title=1998/99 Season Review: Man Utd seal the treble |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=20 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal were also defeated in a FA Cup [[1998–99 FA Cup#Semi-finals|semi-final replay]] against Manchester United in April 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;FACup&quot;/&gt; With the score 1–1 heading into injury time, Arsenal were awarded a penalty after midfielder [[Ray Parlour]] was brought down by [[Phil Neville]] inside the 18-yard box.

The [[1999–2000 Arsenal F.C. season|1999–2000 season]] proved to be a frustrating one for both Arsenal and Bergkamp. The club finished second in the league, 18 points behind Manchester United, and lost in the [[2000 UEFA Cup Final]] to Turkish opponents [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] on penalties.&lt;ref name=2000UEFACupFinal&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/752751.stm |title=Penalty heartbreak for Arsenal |website=BBC News |date=17 May 2000 |accessdate=27 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The departure of compatriot [[Marc Overmars]] and French midfielder [[Emmanuel Petit]] in the close season led to speculation over Bergkamp's future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/936020.stm |title=Bergkamp future still uncertain |date=21 September 2000 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ultimately agreed terms on a contract extension in December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/1090298.stm |title=Bergkamp and Parlour agree deals |date=28 December 2000 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an array of new signings made in the [[2000–01 Arsenal F.C. season|2000–01 season]], Arsenal were runners-up in the league for a third year in succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1310320.stm |title=Arsenal outgun Leeds |date=5 May 2001 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[Thierry Henry]] and [[Sylvain Wiltord]] as the main [[Forward (association football)|strikers]] saw Bergkamp's first-team opportunities limited as a result.

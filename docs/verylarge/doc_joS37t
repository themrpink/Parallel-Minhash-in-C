===Office of the Secretary of Defense===
{{main|Office of the Secretary of Defense}}
The secretary's principally civilian staff element is called the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]] (OSD) and is composed of the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|deputy secretary of defense]] (DEPSECDEF) and five under secretaries of defense in the fields of [[Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics|acquisition, technology &amp; logistics]], [[Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)|comptroller/chief financial officer]], [[Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence|intelligence]], [[Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness|personnel &amp; readiness]], and [[Under Secretary of Defense for Policy|policy]]; several [[Assistant Secretary of Defense|assistant secretaries of defense]]; other directors and the staffs under them.

The name of the principally military staff organization, organized under the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is the [[Joint Staff]] (JS).

===Awards and decorations===
The [[Defense Distinguished Service Medal]] (DDSM), the [[Defense Superior Service Medal]] (DSSM), the [[Defense Meritorious Service Medal]] (DMSM), the [[Joint Service Commendation Medal]] (JSCM) and the [[Joint Service Achievement Medal]] (JSAM) are awarded, to military personnel for service in joint duty assignments, in the name of the secretary of defense. In addition, there is the [[Joint Meritorious Unit Award]] (JMUA), which is the only ribbon (as in non-medal) and unit award issued to joint DoD activities, also issued in the name of the secretary of defense.

The DDSM is analogous to the distinguished services medals issued by the military departments (i.e. [[Army Distinguished Service Medal]], [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] &amp; [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]]), the DSSM corresponds to the [[Legion of Merit]], the DMSM to the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]], the JSCM to the service commendation medals, and the JSAM to the achievement medals issued by the services. While the approval authority for DSSM, DMSM, JSCM, JSAM and JMUA is delegated to inferior DoD officials: the DDSM can only be awarded by the secretary of defense.

Recommendations for the [[Medal of Honor]] (MOH), formally endorsed in writing by the secretary of the military department concerned and the [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], are processed through the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness|under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness]], and such recommendations be must approved by the secretary of defense before it can be handed over to the president, who is the final approval authority for the MOH, although it is awarded in the name of [[United States Congress|Congress]].

The secretary of defense, with the concurrence of the [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]], is the approval authority for the acceptance and wear of [[NATO]] medals issued by the [[Secretary General of NATO|secretary general of NATO]] and offered to the [[United States Permanent Representative to NATO|U.S. permanent representative to NATO]] in recognition of U.S. servicemembers who meet the eligibility criteria specified by NATO.&lt;ref name=&quot;1348.33, V3:39&quot;&gt;[[#13483, V3|DoDM 1348.33, Vol 3]]: p.39 (Enclosure 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional committees===
As the head of the department, the secretary of defense is the chief witness for the congressional committees with oversight responsibilities over the Department of Defense. The most important committees, with respect to the entire department, are the two authorizing committees, the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]] (SASC) and the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]] (HASC), and the two appropriations committees, the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Appropriations Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]].

For the DoD intelligence programs the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] and the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] have the principal oversight role.

===National Security Council===
The secretary of defense is a statutory member of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|50|402}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the principals, the secretary along with the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], secretary of state and the [[Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs|assistant to the president for national security affairs]] participates in biweekly Principals Committee (PC) meetings, preparing and coordinating issues before they are brought before full NSC sessions chaired by the president.

===Role in the military justice system===
The secretary is one of only five or six civilians—the others being the president, the three &quot;service secretaries&quot; (the [[secretary of the Army]], [[secretary of the Navy]], and [[secretary of the Air Force]]), and the [[Secretary of Homeland Security|secretary of homeland security]] (when the [[United States Coast Guard]] is under the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and has not been transferred to the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] under the Department of Defense)—authorized to act as [[convening authority]] in the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|military justice system]] for [[Courts-martial in the United States|General Courts-Martial]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|822}}: article 22, [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|UCMJ]]), Special Courts-Martial ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|823}}: article 23, UCMJ), and Summary Courts-Martial ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|824}}: article 24 UCMJ).

The '''Secretary of War''' was a member of the [[United States]] [[President of the United States|president's]] [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]], beginning with [[Presidency of George Washington|George Washington's administration]]. A similar position, called either &quot;Secretary at War&quot; or &quot;Secretary of War&quot;, had been appointed to serve the [[Congress of the Confederation]] under the [[Articles of Confederation]] between 1781 and 1789. [[Benjamin Lincoln]] and later [[Henry Knox]] held the position. When Washington was inaugurated as the first President under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], he appointed Knox to continue serving as Secretary of War.

The Secretary of War was the head of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]. At first, he was responsible for all military affairs, including [[United States Navy|naval affairs]]. In 1798, the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] was created by statute, and the scope of responsibility for this office was reduced to the affairs of the [[United States Army]].  From 1886 onward, the Secretary of War was in the [[United States presidential line of succession|line of succession to the presidency]], after the [[Vice President of the United States]], the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], the [[President Pro Tempore of the Senate]] and the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].

In 1947, with the passing of the [[National Security Act of 1947]], the Secretary of War was replaced by the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] and the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]], which, along with the Secretary of the Navy, have since 1949 been non-Cabinet subordinates under the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. The Secretary of the Army's office is generally considered the direct successor to the Secretary of War's office although the Secretary of Defense took the Secretary of War's position in the Cabinet, and the [[Presidential Succession Act|line of succession]] to the presidency.

==List of secretaries==

===Secretary at War (1781–1789)===
The office of Secretary at War was modelled upon Great Britain's [[Secretary at War]], who was [[William Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington]], at the time of the American Revolution. The office of Secretary at War was meant to replace both the commander-in-chief and the [[Board of War]], and like the president of the board, the secretary wore no special insignia. The Inspector General, [[Quartermaster General of the United States Army|quartermaster general]], Commissary General, and [[List of Adjutants General of the U.S. Army|Adjutant General]] served on the Secretary's staff. However, the Army itself under Secretary Henry Knox only consisted of 700 men.

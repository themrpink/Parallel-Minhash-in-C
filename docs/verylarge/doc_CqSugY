==Career==
Schulz's first group of regular cartoons, a weekly series of one-panel jokes called ''[[Lil' Folks]]'', was published from June 1947 to January 1950 in the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]],'' with Schulz usually doing four one-panel drawings per issue. It was in ''Li'l Folks'' that Schulz first used the name [[Charlie Brown]] for a character, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys as well as one buried in sand. The series also had a dog that looked much like [[Snoopy]]. In May 1948, Schulz sold his first one-panel drawing to ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''; within the next two years, a total of 17 untitled drawings by Schulz were published in the ''Post'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airplanesandrockets.com/magazines/charles-schulz-saturday-evening-post.htm|title=Saturday Evening Post &quot;Li'l Folks&quot; Comics by Charles Schulz|author=Kirt Blattenberger Airplanes and Rockets}}&lt;/ref&gt; simultaneously with his work for the ''Pioneer Press''. Around the same time, he tried to have ''Li'l Folks'' syndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association; Schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. ''Li'l Folks'' was dropped from the ''Pioneer Press'' in January 1950.

Later that year, Schulz approached [[United Feature Syndicate]] with the one-panel series ''Li'l Folks'', and the syndicate became interested. By that time Schulz had also developed a comic strip, usually using four panels rather than one, and to Schulz's delight, the syndicate preferred that version. ''Peanuts'' made its first appearance on October 2, 1950, in seven newspapers. The weekly Sunday page debuted on January 6, 1952. After a slow start, ''Peanuts'' eventually became one of the most popular comic strips of all time, as well as one of the most influential. Schulz also had a short-lived sports-oriented comic strip, ''[[It's Only a Game]]'' (1957–59), but he abandoned it after the success of ''Peanuts''. From 1956 to 1965 he contributed a [[gag cartoon]], ''[[Young Pillars]]'', featuring teenagers, to ''Youth'', a publication associated with the [[Church of God (Anderson)|Church of God]].

In 1957 and 1961 he illustrated two volumes of [[Art Linkletter]]'s ''Kids Say the Darndest Things'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kids say the darndest things!|publisher=Worldcat|oclc=336428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kids still say the darndest things!|publisher=Worldcat|oclc=11396008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1964 a collection of letters, ''Dear President Johnson'', by Bill Adler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dear President Johnson|isbn=978-0740766756|oclc=1383960}}{{page?|date=November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Peanuts'' ===
{{Main|Peanuts}}
At its height, ''Peanuts'' was published daily in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, in 21 languages. Over nearly 50 years, Schulz drew 17,897 published ''Peanuts'' strips.{{sfnp | Kidd | Spear | 2015 | loc=back cover }} The strips, plus merchandise and product endorsements, produced revenues of more than $1 billion per year, with Schulz earning an estimated $30 million to $40 million annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt; During the strip's run, Schulz took only one vacation, a five-week break in late 1997 to celebrate his 75th birthday; reruns of the strip ran during his vacation, the only time that occurred during Schulz's life.

The first collection of ''Peanuts'' strips was published in July 1952 by [[Rinehart &amp; Company]]. Many more books followed, greatly contributing to the strip's increasing popularity. In 2004, [[Fantagraphics]] began their ''Complete Peanuts'' series. ''Peanuts'' also proved popular in other media; the first animated TV special, ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'', aired in December 1965 and won an Emmy award. Numerous TV specials followed, the latest being ''Happiness is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown'' in 2011. Until his death, Schulz wrote or co-wrote the TV specials and carefully oversaw their production.

[[File:CharlesMShultzJun96.jpg|thumb|right|Schulz receiving his star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in June 1996]]
Charlie Brown, the principal character of ''Peanuts'', was named after a co-worker at Art Instruction Inc. Schulz drew much from his own life, some examples being:
* Like Charlie Brown's parents, Schulz's father was a barber and his mother a housewife.
* Like Charlie Brown, Schulz had often felt shy and withdrawn. In an interview with Charlie Rose in May 1997, Schulz observed, &quot;I suppose there's a melancholy feeling in a lot of cartoonists, because cartooning, like all other humor, comes from bad things happening.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kleon|first=Austin|date=October 17, 2007|url=http://austinkleon.com/2007/10/17/charles-schultz-on-charlie-rose|title=CHARLES SCHULZ ON CHARLIE ROSE|work=austinkleon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Schulz reportedly had an intelligent dog when he was a boy. Although this dog was a [[Pointer (dog breed)|pointer]], not a [[beagle]] like Snoopy, family photos confirm a certain physical resemblance.
* References to Snoopy's brother [[Snoopy#Siblings|Spike]] living outside of [[Needles, California]], were influenced by the few years (1928–30) the Schulz family lived there; they moved to Needles to join other family members who had relocated from Minnesota to tend to an ill cousin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Needles&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1989|pp=30–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Schulz's inspiration for Charlie Brown's unrequited love for the [[Little Red-Haired Girl]] was [[Little Red-Haired Girl#Inspiration|Donna Mae Johnson]], an Art Instruction Inc. accountant with whom he fell in love. When Schulz finally proposed to her in June 1950, shortly after he had made his first contract with his syndicate, she turned him down and married another man.
* [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]] and [[Shermy (Peanuts)|Shermy]] were named for his good friends [[Linus Maurer]] and Sherman Plepler, respectively.&lt;ref name=sitribune&gt;{{cite news|first=Carole|last=Kelleher |title=Linus Maurer, 1926–2016 |url=http://www.sonomanews.com/news/5179817-181/linus-maurer-1926-2016?artslide=0 |work=Sonoma Index–Tribune |date=February 4, 2016 |access-date=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Peppermint Patty]] was inspired by Patricia Swanson, one of his cousins on his mother's side. Schulz devised the character's name when he saw peppermint candies in his house.&lt;ref name=&quot;mich&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Michaelis|2007|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-03-26/entertainment/0003270180_1_lucy-van-pelt-charles-schulz-peppermint-patty|title=Charlie Brown was the name of one of...|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=March 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
The Charles M. Schulz Museum counts [[Milton Caniff]] (''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'') and [[Bill Mauldin]] as key influences on Schulz's work. In his own strip, Schulz regularly described Snoopy's annual [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]] visits with Mauldin, including mention of Mauldin's World War II cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comics.com/peanuts/ |title=Peanuts by Schulz |publisher=Comics.com |quote=November 11th strips from 1969–70, '76, '79–81, '83, '85–89, '91–93, '96–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schulz (and critics) also credited [[George Herriman]] (''[[Krazy Kat]]''), [[Roy Crane]] (''[[Wash Tubbs]]''), [[Elzie C. Segar]] (''[[Thimble Theatre]]'') and [[Percy Crosby]] (''[[Skippy (comic strip)|Skippy]]'') as influences. In a 1994 address to fellow cartoonists, Schulz discussed several of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hoganmag.com/blog/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/|title=Charles M. Schulz on Cartooning|work=Hogan's Alley|access-date=August 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to his biographer [[Rheta Grimsley Johnson]]:

{{quote|It would be impossible to narrow down three or two or even one direct influence on [Schulz's] personal drawing style. The uniqueness of &quot;Peanuts&quot; has set it apart for years ... That one-of-a-kind quality permeates every aspect of the strip and very clearly extends to the drawing. It is purely his with no clear forerunners and no subsequent pretenders.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1989), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the museum, Schulz watched the movie ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' 40 times. The character [[Lucy van Pelt]] also expresses a fondness for the film, and in one strip she cruelly spoils the ending for her younger brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/the-pbs-series-american-masters-good-ol-charles-schulz-634714.html|title=Yahoo|access-date=June 19, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729001417/http://voices.yahoo.com/the-pbs-series-american-masters-good-ol-charles-schulz-634714.html|archive-date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In April 1951, Schulz married Joyce Halverson (no relation to Schulz's mother Dena Halverson Schulz),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Schulz &amp; Peanuts Time Line |url=http://www.schulzmuseum.org/timeline.html |publisher=Charles M. Schulz Museum |access-date=January 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121173110/http://www.schulzmuseum.org/timeline.html |archive-date=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Schulz adopted Halverson's daughter, [[Meredith Hodges|Meredith]]. Later the same year, they moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. Their son, Monte, was born in February 1952, and three more children were born later, in Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Igne|2000|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schulz and his family returned to Minneapolis and stayed until 1958. They then moved to [[Sebastopol, California]], where Schulz built his first studio. (Until then, he'd worked at home or in a small rented office room.) It was there that Schulz was interviewed for the unaired television documentary ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1963 film)|A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]''. Some of the footage was eventually used in a later documentary, ''[[Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz|edition=The original documentary on DVD |publisher= Charles M. Schulz Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schulz's father died while visiting him in 1966, the same year Schulz's Sebastopol studio burned down. By 1969, Schulz had moved to Santa Rosa, California, where he lived and worked until his death. While briefly living in Colorado Springs, Schulz painted a mural on the bedroom wall of his daughter Meredith, featuring Patty with a balloon, Charlie Brown jumping over a candlestick, and Snoopy playing on all fours. The wall was removed in 2001, donated and relocated to the [[Charles M. Schulz Museum]] in Santa Rosa.

By Thanksgiving 1970, it was clear that Schulz's marriage was in trouble.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Good Ol' Charles Schulz|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/charles-schulz/good-ol-charles-schulz/86/|series=[[American Masters]]|network=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|airdate=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was having an affair with a 25-year-old woman named Tracey Claudius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=I only dread one day at a time! | author=Miller, Laura | work=Salon | url=http://www.salon.com/2007/10/13/charles_schulz/ | date=October 8, 2007 | access-date=May 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Schulzes divorced in 1972, and in September 1973 he married Jean Forsyth Clyde, whom he had first met when she brought her daughter to his hockey rink.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;/&gt; They were married for 27 years, until Schulz's death in 2000.

===Kidnapping attempt===
On Sunday, May 8, 1988, two gunmen in ski masks entered the Schulzes' home through an unlocked door, planning to kidnap Jean, but the attempt failed when their daughter Jill drove up to the house, prompting the would-be kidnappers to flee. Jill called the police from a neighbor's house. [[Sonoma County]] Sheriff Dick Michaelsen said, &quot;It was obviously an attempted kidnap-ransom. This was a targeted criminal act. They knew exactly who the victims were.&quot; Neither Schulz nor his wife was hurt during the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB72DB00CB05CFA&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Cartoonist's Home Invaded in Apparent Kidnap Attempt|work=San Jose Mercury News|date= May 13, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eXsUAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3975,2195263&amp;dq=kidnap+charles-schulz&amp;hl=en |title=Good grief, it's a kidnap attempt|work=Toledo Blade|date= May 13, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
[[File:Charles M. Schulz Highland Arena.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Charles M. Schulz Highland Arena on Snelling Avenue and Ford Parkway in Saint Paul, Minnesota.]]
Schulz had a long association with ice sports, and both [[figure skating]] and [[ice hockey]] featured prominently in his cartoons. In Santa Rosa, he owned the [[Redwood Empire Ice Arena]], which opened in 1969 and featured a snack bar called &quot;The Warm Puppy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Schulz's daughter Amy served as a model for the figure skating in the television special ''[[She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown]]'' (1980). Schulz also was very active in senior ice-hockey tournaments; in 1975, he formed [[Snoopy's Senior World Hockey Tournament]] at his Redwood Empire Ice Arena, and in 1981, he was awarded the [[Lester Patrick Trophy]] for outstanding service to the sport of hockey in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.hhof.com/htmlsilverware/silver_splashlesterpatrick.shtml Legends of Hockey – Non-NHL Trophies – Lester Patrick Trophy],&quot; Hockey Hall of Fame (accessed June 2, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Schulz also enjoyed golf and was a member of the Santa Rosa Golf and Country Club from 1959 to 2000.

In 1998, Schulz hosted the first Over 75 Hockey Tournament. In 2000, the Ramsey County Board in St. Paul, Minnesota voted to rename the Highland Park Ice Arena the Charles M. Schulz–Highland Arena in his honor.

Schulz also used his Hockey Rink for Tennis exhibitions after meeting [[Billie Jean King]]. Many tennis pros played in that rink including [[Roy Emerson]].

===Art===
In addition to comics, Schulz was interested in art in general; his favorite artist in his later years was [[Andrew Wyeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/books/review/McGrath-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |work=The New York Times|title=Review of ''Schulz and Peanuts''}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young adult, Schulz also developed a passion for classical music. Although the character Schroeder in ''Peanuts'' adored [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], Schulz's personal favorite composer was reportedly [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt;

===Religion===
According to a 2015 &quot;spiritual biography&quot;, Schulz's faith was complex and personal.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Lind, Stephen J. (2015) ''A Charlie Brown Religion'' (Jackson: U P Mississippi)&lt;/ref&gt; He often touched on religious themes in his work, including the classic television cartoon ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' (1965), which features Linus quoting the [[King James Version of the Bible]] {{bibleref2|Luke|2:8–14|KJV|Luke 2:8–14}} to explain &quot;what Christmas is all about&quot;. In interviews Schulz said that Linus represented his spiritual side, and the spiritual biography points out a much wider array of religious references.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

Reared in a nominally Lutheran family, Schulz was active in the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana) as a young adult and later taught Sunday school at a [[United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; In the 1960s,

From the late 1980s, Schulz said in interviews that some people had described him as a &quot;[[secular humanism|secular humanist]]&quot; but that he did not know one way or the other:&lt;ref&gt;Templeton, David. [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/12.30.99/schulz2-9952.html My Lunch with Sparky], reproduced from the December 30, 1999 – January 5, 2000 issue of the ''Sonoma County Independent''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080917015352/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/12.30.99/schulz2-9952.html Archived] November 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I do not go to church anymore ... I guess you might say I've come around to secular humanism, an obligation I believe all humans have to others and the world we live in.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1989|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2013, Schulz's widow said:

{{quote|I think that he was a deeply thoughtful and spiritual man. Sparky was not the sort of person who would say &quot;oh that's God's will&quot; or &quot;God will take care of it.&quot; I think to him that was an easy statement, and he thought that God was much more complicated.

When he came back from the army he was very lonely. His mother had died and he was invited to church by a pastor who had prepared his mother's service from the Church of God. Sparky's father was worried about him and was talking to the pastor and so the pastor invited Sparky to come to church. So Sparky went to church, joined the youth group and for a good 4–5 years he went to Bible study and went to church 3 times a week (2 Bible studies, 1 service). He said he had read the Bible through three times and taught Sunday school. He was always looking for what those passages REALLY might have meant. Some of his discussions with priests and ministers were so interesting because he wanted to find out what these people (who he thought were more educated than he) thought.

When he taught Sunday school, he would never tell people what to believe. God was very important to him, but in a very deep way, in a very mysterious way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1snoy1/im_jean_schulz_my_husband_drew_the_peanuts_comic/|title=I'm Jean Schulz.

===Failing health and retirement===
[[File:Charles Schulz crop 1993.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Schulz in 1993]]
In July 1981, Schulz underwent heart bypass surgery. During his hospital stay, President [[Ronald Reagan]] phoned to wish him a quick recovery.

In the 1980s, Schulz complained that &quot;sometimes my hand shakes so much I have to hold my wrist to draw.&quot; This led to an erroneous impression that Schulz had [[Parkinson's disease]]. According to a letter from his physician, placed in the Archives of the [[Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center|Charles M. Schulz Museum]] by his widow, Schulz had [[essential tremor]], a condition alleviated by [[beta blocker]]s. Schulz still insisted on writing and drawing the strip by himself, resulting in noticeably shakier lines over time.

In November 1999, Schulz suffered several small strokes and a blocked aorta, and he was later found to have [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]] that had [[metastasis|metastasized]]. Because of the [[chemotherapy]] and the fact that he could not see clearly, he announced his retirement on December 14, 1999. This was difficult for Schulz, who told [[Al Roker]] on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', &quot;I never dreamed that this was what would happen to me. I always had the feeling that I would probably stay with the strip until I was in my early eighties. But all of a sudden it's gone. It's been taken away from me. I did not take this away from me.&quot;&lt;ref name=Michaelis&gt;{{harvnb|Michaelis|2007|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schulz was asked if, in his final ''Peanuts'' strip, Charlie Brown would finally get to kick the football after so many decades (one of the many recurring themes in ''Peanuts'' was Charlie Brown's attempts to kick a football while Lucy was holding it, only to have Lucy pull it back at the last moment, causing him to fall on his back). His response, &quot;Oh, no. Definitely not. I couldn't have Charlie Brown kick that football; that would be a terrible disservice to him after nearly half a century.&quot; But in a December 1999 interview, holding back tears, Schulz recounted the moment when he signed his final strip, saying, &quot;All of a sudden I thought, 'You know, that poor, poor kid, he never even got to kick the football. What a dirty trick—he never had a chance to kick the football.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Schulz |first=Charles |interviewer=[[Al Roker]]|title=Interview with Al Roker|date=December 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Schulz died at his home on February 12, 2000, at the age of 77, of [[colon cancer]]. The last original ''Peanuts'' strip was published the next day. He had predicted that the strip would outlive him because the strips were usually drawn weeks before their publication. Schulz was buried at Pleasant Hills Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt;

As part of his contract with the syndicate, Schulz requested that no other artist be allowed to draw ''Peanuts''. United Features had legal ownership of the strip, but honored his wishes, instead [[print syndication|syndicating]] reruns to newspapers. New television specials have also been produced since Schulz's death, with the stories based on previous strips; Schulz always said the TV shows were entirely separate from the strip.

Schulz was honored on May 27, 2000, by cartoonists of more than 100 comic strips, who paid homage to him and ''Peanuts'' by incorporating his characters into their strips that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fivecentsplease.org/dpb/peantfaq.txt Peanuts Faq, section 3.6], Derrick Bang&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.chivian.com/chivian/PeanutsTribute.html |title = Cartoonists pay tribute to Charles M.

==Awards==
[[File:Schulz star.jpg|right|thumb|Schulz's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
Schulz received the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Humor Comic Strip Award in 1962 for ''Peanuts'', the Society's Elzie Segar Award in 1980, and was also the first two-time winner of their [[Reuben Award]] for 1955 and 1964, and their Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sulkis |first=Brian |title=Cartoonist's characters spread a gentle message |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/11/WBG0VB7IFI1.DTL&amp;type=printable |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 11, 2005 |access-date=November 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an avid hockey fan; in 1981, Schulz was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding contributions to the sport of hockey in the United States, and he was inducted into the [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Apple |first=Chris |title=Resolutions for 2002 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/statitudes/news/2002/01/04/just_stats/ |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=January 5, 2002 |access-date=November 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 28, 1996, Schulz was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], adjacent to [[Walt Disney]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whiting |first=Sam |title=The Peanuts Gallery Is Closed |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1999/12/15/DD35372.DTL&amp;type=printable |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=December 15, 1999 |access-date=November 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A replica of this star appears outside his former studio in Santa Rosa.

On January 1, 1974, Schulz served as the Grand Marshal of the [[Tournament of Roses Parade|Rose Parade]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. The same year, he received the [[Inkpot Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comic-con.org/awards/inkpot Inkpot Award]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Schulz received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]] presented by Awards Council member Judge [[John Sirica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schulz was a keen [[contract bridge|bridge]] player, and ''Peanuts'' occasionally included bridge references.

==Biographies==
Multiple biographies have been written about Schulz, including Rheta Grimsley Johnson's ''Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz'' (1989), which Schulz authorized.

The lengthiest biography, ''Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography'' (2007) by David Michaelis, has been heavily criticized by the Schulz family; Schulz's son Monte stated it has &quot;a number of factual errors throughout&amp;nbsp; ... [including] factual errors of interpretation&quot; and extensively documents these errors in a number of essays. However, Michaelis maintains that there is &quot;no question&quot; his work is accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schulz|first =Monte|title=Regarding ''Schulz and Peanuts''|newspaper=[[The Comics Journal]]| issue =290 | pages=27–78 |date=May 2008|issn=0194-7869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=837&amp;Itemid=48|title=The Comics Journal&amp;nbsp;– The Schulz and Peanuts Roundtable (excerpts from TCJ #290)|last=Schulz|first=Monte|author2=Gary Groth|date=May 18, 2008|newspaper=The Comics Journal|publisher=[[Fantagraphics]]|access-date=July 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208161351/http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=837&amp;Itemid=48|archive-date=December 8, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cohen |first=Patricia |title=Biography of 'Peanuts' Creator Stirs Family |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/08/books/08schu.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin |access-date=October 8, 2007|newspaper=The New York Times| date=October 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although cartoonist [[Bill Watterson]] (creator of ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'') feels the biography does justice to Schulz's legacy, while giving insight into the emotional impetus of the creation of the strips, cartoonist and critic [[R.C. Harvey]] regards the book as falling short both in describing Schulz as a cartoonist and in fulfilling Michaelis' stated aim of &quot;understanding how Charles Schulz knew the world&quot;; Harvey feels the biography bends the facts to a thesis rather than evoking a thesis from the facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watterson |first=Bill |title=The Grief That Made 'Peanuts' Good |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB119214690326956694.html?mod=djm_HAWSJSB_Welcome |access-date=October 16, 2007 | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Harvey | first =R.C. | title =The Pagliacci Bit | journal = The Comics Journal | issue =290 | pages=79–92 |date=May 2008 | issn=0194-7869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Harvey | first =R.C. | title =Schulz Roundtable Round Two | journal = The Comics Journal | issue =290 | pages=101–105 |date=May 2008 | issn=0194-7869 }} Excerpt available: {{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=836&amp;Itemid=48|title=The Comics Journal&amp;nbsp;– Schulz Roundtable Round Two (excerpt from TCJ #290)|last=Harvey|first=R.C.|author-link=R.

Shanahan cites, in particular, such things as Michaelis' crude characterizations of Schulz's mother's family, and &quot;an almost voyeuristic quality&quot; to the hundred pages devoted to the breakup of Schulz's first marriage.

In light of Michaelis' biography and the controversy surrounding his interpretation of the personality who was Charles Schulz, responses from Schulz's family reveal some intimate knowledge about the Schulz's persona beyond that of mere artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/books/more-on-the-schulz-book#comment-34417 |title=Cartoon Brew: Leading the Animation Conversation &quot; More on the Schulz Book |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=October 13, 2007 |work=[[Cartoon Brew]] |access-date=July 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915100932/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/books/more-on-the-schulz-book#comment-34417 |archive-date=September 15, 2008 }} on July 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==&lt;!-- This section is linked from Peanuts --&gt;
A proponent of manned spaceflight, Schulz was honored with the naming of [[Apollo 10]] [[Apollo command module|command module]] ''Charlie Brown'' and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] ''[[Snoopy#In aviation and space|Snoopy]]'', launched on May 18, 1969. The [[Silver Snoopy award]] is a special honor awarded to NASA employees and contractors for outstanding achievements related to human flight safety or mission success. The award certificate states that it is &quot;In Appreciation&quot; &quot;For professionalism, dedication and outstanding support that greatly enhanced space flight safety and mission success.&quot;

On July 1, 1983, [[Camp Snoopy]] opened at [[Knott's Berry Farm]], a forested, mountain theme area featuring the ''Peanuts'' characters. It has rides designed for younger children and is one of the most popular areas of the amusement park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Merritt, Christopher |author2=Lynxwiler, J. Eric|title=Knott's Preserved: From Boysenberry to Theme Park, the History of Knott's Berry Farm|pages=144–147|publisher= Angel City Press|location= Santa Monica, CA|date= 2010|isbn= 978-1-883318-97-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]], opened in 1992, the amusement park in the center of the mall was themed around Schulz's ''Peanuts'' characters until the mall lost the rights to use the brand in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/camp-snoopy-who-nickelodeon-runs-the-show-now-at-mall-of-america/130570388/|title=Camp Snoopy Who? Nickelodeon runs the show now at Mall of America|website=Star Tribune|access-date=2018-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jean and Charles Schulz Information Center at [[Sonoma State University]] opened in 2000 and now stands as one of the largest buildings in the CSU system and the State of California, with a 400,000-volume general collection and with a 750,000-volume automated retrieval system capacity. The $41.5 million building was named after Schulz, and his wife donated the $5 million needed to build and furnish the structure.

In 2000, the [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]] Board of Supervisors renamed the county airport as the [[Charles M. Schulz–Sonoma County Airport]] in the cartoonist's honor. The airport's logo features Snoopy in goggles and scarf, taking to the skies on top of his red doghouse.

Peanuts on Parade has been St. Paul, Minnesota's tribute to its favorite native cartoonist. It began in 2000 with the placing of 101 {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} statues of Snoopy throughout the city of St. Paul. Every summer for the following four years, statues of a different ''Peanuts'' character were placed on the sidewalks of St. Paul. In 2001, there was ''Charlie Brown Around Town'', 2002 brought ''Looking for Lucy'', in 2003 along came ''Linus Blankets St. Paul'', ending in 2004 with ''Snoopy'' lying on his doghouse. The statues were auctioned off at the end of each summer, so some remain around the city, but others have been relocated. The auction proceeds were used for artist's scholarships and for permanent, bronze statues of the ''Peanuts'' characters. These bronze statues are in Landmark Plaza and Rice Park in downtown St. Paul.

The [[Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center]] in Santa Rosa opened on August 17, 2002, two blocks away from his former studio, celebrating his life's work and the art of cartooning. A bronze statue of Charlie Brown and Snoopy stands in Depot Park in downtown Santa Rosa.

Santa Rosa, California, celebrated the 60th anniversary of the strip in 2005 by continuing the Peanuts on Parade tradition beginning with ''It's Your Town, Charlie Brown'' (2005), ''Summer of Woodstock'' (2006), ''Snoopy's Joe Cool Summer'' (2007), and ''Look Out For Lucy'' (2008).

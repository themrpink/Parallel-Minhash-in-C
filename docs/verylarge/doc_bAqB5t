Despite the suburban environment, a variety of wildlife inhabits the university's central park, open fields, and wetlands. The university is home to [[cougar]], [[hawk]]s, [[golden eagle]]s, [[great blue heron]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[peregrine falcon]]s, rabbits, [[raccoon]]s, [[owl]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bat]]s, and [[coyote]]s. The [[University of California, Irvine, Arboretum|UCI Arboretum]] hosts a collection of plants from California and Mediterranean climates around the world. The rabbits in particular are very numerous and can be seen across campus in high numbers, especially during hours of low student traffic.

=== Architecture ===
[[File:kriegerhall.jpg|thumb|[[Murray Krieger]] Hall in the School of Humanities, named after an inspirational professor and an example of the [[Brutalist]] architecture of the campus]]
The first buildings were designed by a team of architects led by [[William Pereira]] and including [[A. Quincy Jones]] and William Blurock. The initial landscaping, including Aldrich Park, was designed by an association of three firms, including that of the noted urban-landscaping innovator Robert Herrick Carter. Aldrich Park was designed under the direction of landscape architect Gene Uematsu, and was modeled after [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]'s designs for New York City's [[Central Park]]. The campus opened in 1965 with the inner circle and park only half-completed. There were only nine buildings and a dirt road connecting the main campus to the housing units. Only three of the six &quot;spokes&quot; that radiate from the central park were built, with only two buildings each. Pereira was retained by the university to maintain a continuity of style among the buildings constructed in the inner ring around the park, the last of which was completed in 1972. These buildings were designed in a style which combined sweeping curves and expressionistic shapes with elements of classic California architecture such as red tiled roofs and clay-tiled walkways, and distinctive white railings evoking the deck of an ocean liner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uci.edu/ucihistory/index.php?page=architecture&amp;function=pereira|title=William Pereira, Architect|access-date=September 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109194724/http://www.lib.uci.edu/ucihistory/index.php?page=architecture&amp;function=pereira|archive-date=January 9, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; These buildings featured an innovative structural design that freed the interiors from support columns in order to allow future alterations of their floor plans.

[[File:Engineering,UCI.jpg|thumb|Henry Samueli School of Engineering complex in 2006. Buildings in the lower right quadrant of the image have since been demolished.]]
Construction on the campus all but ceased after the Administration building, Aldrich Hall, was completed in 1974, and then resumed in the late 1980s, beginning a massive building boom that still continues today. This second building boom continued the futuristic trend, but emphasized a much more colorful, [[postmodern]] approach that somewhat contradicted the earthy, organic designs of the early buildings. Architects such as [[Frank Gehry]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Eric Owen Moss]], [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and [[Arthur Erickson]] were brought in to bring the campus more up to date. The recession in the early 1990s along with internal politics led to a change in direction, due to the reduced capital budget, and changing attitudes towards architectural innovation at the university. This, in turn, led to a &quot;contextualist&quot; approach beginning in the late 1990s combining stylistic elements of the first two phases in an attempt to provide an architectural &quot;middle ground&quot; between the two vastly different styles. Gehry's building was recently removed from campus to make way for a new building, with a design that has been called a &quot;big beige box with bands of bricks&quot;. In 2009 the Humanities Gateway building, designed by [[Curtis W. Fentress]], was opened. Its curvilinear design marked a return to the sculptural treatment of concrete begun by Pereira.

As of 2005, the campus has more than 200 buildings and encompasses most of the university's {{convert|1525|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;lib&quot;/&gt; The campus is in the midst of a $1.1 billion construction campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/healthscience/scienceenvironment/article_1212008.php|title=UCI undergoing historic expansion|newspaper=[[Orange County Register]]|date=July 17, 2006|access-date=April 6, 2008|last=Robbins|first=Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to holding a noted [[Critical Theory]] archive and Southeast Asian archive, the Libraries also contain extensive collections in Dance and Performing Arts, Regional History, and more. Additionally, Langson Library hosts an extensive East Asian collection with materials in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

Nearly all departments and schools on campus complement the resources of the UC Irvine Libraries by maintaining their own reading rooms and scholarly meeting rooms. They contain small reference collections and are the choice for more intimate lectures, graduate seminars, and study sessions. There is also the large Gateway Study Center located across from Langson Library, one of the university's original buildings and under the custody of UC Irvine Libraries. Having served formerly as a cafeteria and student center, it is now a dual-use computer lab and study area which is open nearly 24 hours.

The UCI Student Center offers a large number of study areas, auditoriums, and two food courts, and therefore is one of the most popular places to study on campus. UC Irvine also has a number of computer labs that serve as study centers. The School of Humanities maintains the Humanities Instructional Resource Center, a drop-in computer lab specializing in language and digital media. Additionally, UCI maintains five other drop-in labs, four instructional computer labs, and a number of reservation-only SmartClassrooms, some of which are open 24 hours. Other popular study areas include Aldrich Park, the Cross-Cultural Center, the Locus (a study room and computer lab used by the Campuswide Honors Program), and plazas located in every school.

=== Tunnels ===
A network of [[tunnel]]s runs between many of the major buildings on campus and the Central Plant, with the major trunk passage located beneath Ring Mall. Smaller tunnels branch off from this main passage to reach individual buildings, carrying electrical and air-conditioning utilities from the Central Plant. These tunnels have been the subject of much campus lore, the most popular story being that the tunnels were constructed to facilitate the safe evacuation of faculty in the event of a student riot. The main tunnel actually contains an above-ground section, in the form of the interior of an unusually thick pedestrian bridge near the Engineering Tower, in an area where the Ring Mall crosses between two hills. The tunnels are only accessible to maintenance staff, although there are also publicly accessible tunnels which intersect the utility tunnels, such as the one that goes between the main Information &amp; Computer Science building and the Engineering Tower.{{citation needed |date=April 2019}}

== Governance ==
Like other [[University of California]] campuses, UC Irvine is governed by a Chancellor who has significant authority over campus academic and planning affairs. The Chancellor, in turn, is nominated by and is responsible to the [[Regents of the University of California]] and the UC President:
* 1962 [[Daniel G. Aldrich]]
* 1984 [[Jack W. Peltason]]
* 1993 [[Laurel L. Wilkening]]
* 1998 [[Ralph J. Cicerone]]
* 2005 [[Michael V. Drake]]
* 2014 [[Howard Gillman]]

After the Chancellor, the second most senior official is the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=UC Irvine: Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost | year=2006 | publisher=University of California, Irvine | url=http://www.evc.uci.edu/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; He serves as the university's chief academic and operating officer. Every school on campus reports to the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost through a Dean, and all other academic and administrative units report to his office through a Vice Chancellor or chief administrator. A partial list of these units includes Campus Recreation, Intercollegiate Athletics, Planning and Budget, Student Affairs, UC Irvine Libraries, UC Irvine Medical Center, and University Advancement. The Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost also governs the faculty senate.

=== Admissions ===
UC Irvine is categorized by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' as &quot;most selective&quot; for college admissions in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University of California--Irvine |work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |access-date=March 8, 2020 |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-irvine-1314}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third-most selective [[University of California]] campus for the freshman class entering in the fall of 2019, as measured by the ratio of admitted students to applicants (behind [[UC Berkeley]] and [[UCLA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Undergraduate Admissions Summary |publisher=University of California |url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/admissions-residency-and-ethnicity |access-date=March 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; UC Irvine received 95,566 applications for admission to the fall 2019 incoming freshman class and 25,394 were admitted, making UC Irvine's acceptance rate 26.6% for fall 2019. The middle 50% range for [[SAT]] scores of fall 2019 enrolled freshmen were 650-790 for math and 600-720 for evidence based reading and writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/irvine/freshman-admit-data.html |title= Irvine: Freshman admit data |website=|publisher=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incoming 2018 freshmen were predominantly from [[Los Angeles County]], followed by [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] counties, [[San Bernardino County]], [[Riverside County]], and [[San Diego County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New Freshmen by California County - Fall Quarter | publisher=UC Irvine Office of Institutional Research | date=2016-10-29 | url=https://www.oir.uci.edu/files/enr/IIB13-new-undergrad-enr-by-calif-county.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice to offer admission is based on the University of California's comprehensive review program. It considers a candidate's personal situation, community involvement, extracurricular activities, and academic potential in addition to the traditional high school academic record, personal statement, and entrance examination scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Eligibility in the Local Context – University of California Office of the President | year=2006 | publisher=University of California Office of the President | url=http://www.ucop.edu/news/factsheets/2001/comprev.pdf | access-date=2016-02-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112033/http://www.ucop.edu/news/factsheets/2001/comprev.pdf | archive-date=2016-03-04 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; While residency is not a factor in admission, it is a factor in tuition expenses, with out-of-state residents spending more annually than California residents. Since the approval of [[1996 California Proposition 209|Proposition 209]] in November 1996, California state law has prohibited all public universities (including UC Irvine) from practicing [[affirmative action]] as part of their admissions processes.

=== Fraternities and sororities ===
The first [[fraternities and sororities]] at UCI began in 1973 with three sororities ([[Delta Gamma]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], and [[Gamma Phi Beta]]) and three fraternities ([[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Sigma Chi]], and [[Phi Delta Theta]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.uci.edu/ucihistory/index.php?page=students&amp;function=fraternities |title = Anteater Chronicles: The UC Irvine Story |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20060916063439/http://www.lib.uci.edu/ucihistory/index.php?page=students&amp;function=fraternities |archivedate=September 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major events and programs in the Greek Community include Songfest, All Greek Conference, Greek Week, BANG (Being a New Greek), and risk management programs (topics vary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dos.uci.edu/greeklife/index.php | title=Greek Life | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406171520/http://www.dos.uci.edu/greeklife/index.php | archivedate=2012-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clubs and organizations ===
With over 650 student clubs and organizations on campus, students can readily find friends who share their interests, whether academic, multicultural, political, religious, service, social, or athletic. Campus activities throughout the year include cultural nights, arts performances, and live music at Anteater Plaz. Special events such as Summerlands, Wayzgoose, Shocktoberfest, Soulstice, and Earth Day are held yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to UCI |url=http://www.admissions.uci.edu/campus_life/welcome_to_uci.html |access-date=July 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120718173324/http://www.admissions.uci.edu/campus_life/welcome_to_uci.html |archivedate=July 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ASUCI]], the university's undergraduate [[student government]], traditionally organizes a [[world record]] attempt by the university at the beginning of each [[academic year]]. UCI has won [[Guinness World Records]] for the largest game of [[capture the flag]] six times, with the most recent one in September 2015. In addition, the university has broken the record for the largest game of [[dodgeball]] three years straight.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCI Guinness World Record&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Irvine breaks Guinness World Record for biggest game of capture the flag|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-0923-uci-capture-flag-20150922-story.html|access-date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCI Records&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Irvine sets Guinness World Record – this time for capturing the flag|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/record-684119-flag-team.html|access-date=23 July 2016|date=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also won records for largest [[water pistol]] fight and largest [[pillow fight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UCI Records Pillow&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Irvine bashes way to largest pillow fight record|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/10/uc-irvine-bashes-way-to-largest-pillow-fight-record-60950|access-date=23 July 2016|date=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 2007, the [[Office of Civil Rights]] of the [[United States Department of Education]] issued a report finding insufficient evidence in support of allegations that Jewish students at UCI were harassed and subjected to a hostile environment based on their religious beliefs. The agency ultimately found that none of the incidents leading to the allegations qualified as &quot;sufficiently severe, pervasive or persistent as to interfere with or limit the ability of an individual to participate in from the services, activities or privileges&quot; provided by UCI, and that university officials had acted appropriately in response to each incident. In December 2007, UCI Administration was cleared of anti-semitism complaints by the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OCR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/newsimages/news/2007/12/OCR_Report_120507-Z05145157-0001.pdf|title=OCR Report|date=November 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216022546/https://www.ocregister.com/newsimages/news/2007/12/OCR_Report_120507-Z05145157-0001.pdf|archivedate=February 16, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=December 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/students-jewish-campus-1939795-officials-report|title=Civil rights investigation clears UCI of anti-Semitism charges|last=Fisher|first=Marla Jo|date=December 11, 2007|access-date=December 20, 2007|newspaper=[[Orange County Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a speech by Drake at the national [[Hillel International|Hillel]] meeting in Washington, D.C. in March 2008, Anteaters for Israel, along with three other Jewish organizations, issued a press release defending Drake and claiming that anti-Semitic activity was &quot;exaggerated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/jewish-uci-student-2007512-students-israel|title=News: Jewish students say UC Irvine is safe|last=Fisher|first=Marla Jo|date=March 28, 2008|access-date=April 4, 2008|newspaper=[[Orange County Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Irvine 11 controversy ====
{{main|Irvine 11 controversy}}

In 2010, eleven students from the [[Muslim Student Union of the University of California, Irvine|Muslim Student Union]] staged a protest against a lecture on campus by Israeli Ambassador [[Michael Oren]] by disrupting his speech several times. The students and the student's union involved were first disciplined by UCI and then had criminal charges brought against them by the District Attorney [[Tony Rackauckas]]. They were convicted of misdemeanor charges and sentenced to three years probation, 56 hours of community service, and fines. This led to a debate on whether the students' protest was free speech and whether filing criminal charges against them was fair after UCI had already disciplined them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Chemerinsky | first=Erwin | title=UC Irvine's free speech debate | website=Los Angeles Times | date=18 February 2010 | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-feb-18-la-oe-chemerinsky18-2010feb18-story.html | access-date=20 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Wahid | first=Abdul | title=The Irvine 11 and Criminalisation of “Free Speech” | website=Islamic Human Rights Commission | date=September 24, 2011 | url=https://www.ihrc.org.uk/news/comment/9857-the-irvine-11-and-criminalising-criticism-of-israel-americas-illusion-of-free-speech-shattered/ | access-date=November 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argued that the students were victims of [[selective prosecution]] and that they were targeted because they were Muslims and supported the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Palestinians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Wiener | first=Jon | title=Irvine Muslim Students Convicted of Shouting at Israeli Ambassador | website=The Nation | date=September 24, 2011 | url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/irvine-muslim-students-convicted-shouting-israeli-ambassador/ | access-date=November 20, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite web

=== Residential accommodations ===
{{Main|Student housing at UC Irvine}}
[[File:Middle Earth dorms, UCI.jpg|thumb|Residence Halls at the [[Middle-earth|Middle Earth]] undergraduate housing complex (for freshmen) are named after places and characters from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' book series.]]
UC Irvine has a number of residential options for students interested in living on campus. Part of UCI's long-range development plan involves expanding on-campus housing to accommodate 50% of all UCI students.&lt;ref name=&quot;evc.uci.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evc.uci.edu/planning/index.html|title=UC Irvine: Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost|year=2006|publisher=University of California, Irvine|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120729085220/http://www.evc.uci.edu/planning/index.html|archivedate=2012-07-29|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The on-campus housing communities for undergraduates are: Mesa Court, Middle Earth, Arroyo Vista, Campus Village, Vista del Campo, Vista del Campo Norte, Camino del Sol, Puerta del Sol, and Plaza Verde. Graduate students also have access to the on-campus housing communities: Palo Verde and Verano Place.

UCI's two freshman dormitory communities are Mesa Court and Middle Earth. Mesa Court was the first housing community at UCI, and features a volleyball court, two basketball courts, a community center, a recreational center, and the Mesa Academic Center (MAC). Middle Earth comprises 24 residence halls, two dining facilities (Brandywine and Pippin Commons), a student center, and several resource centers. Each building in Middle Earth is named after a character or a place from J.R.R. Tolkien's ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''. Middle Earth was built in three phases. The first phase was built in 1974 and includes seven halls: Hobbiton, Isengard, Lorien, Mirkwood, Misty Mountain, Rivendell, and the Shire, along with a separate Head Resident's manufactured home called &quot;Bag End&quot;. The second phase was built in 1989 with thirteen more halls: Balin, Harrowdale, Whispering Wood, Woodhall, Calmindon, Grey Havens, Aldor, Rohan, Gondolin, Snowbourn, Elrond, Shadowfax, and Quenya. The third phase was built in 2000 with four halls: Crickhollow, Evenstar, Oakenshield, and Valimar. Each hall houses about fifty to eighty students, although Quenya was built with sixty single suite rooms which mainly house graduate students. In 2019, two Middle Earth towers were built, which are called Telperion and Laurelin. These towers house around 470 undergraduate students.

There are 42 houses located in Arroyo Vista, of which nine are sorority houses and four are fraternity houses. The sorority houses located in Arroyo Vista are [[Alpha Phi]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Alpha Chi Omega]], and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]]. The fraternity houses located in Arroyo Vista are [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]],and [[Kappa Sigma]]. Arroyo Vista also features many themed houses based on academic or social interests. In the fall of 2012, Arroyo Vista started the &quot;[[First Year Experience]]&quot; and now houses first year students within six of its houses. Students living in Arroyo Vista live in complexes that may be called houses, but have dorm-like qualities.

Apartment-style on-campus housing at UCI can be found at Vista del Campo, Vista del Campo Norte, Camino del Sol, and Puerta del Sol. VDC has single rooms available for undergraduates, while VDC Norte has both single rooms and double rooms available. Camino del Sol features single rooms, a community center, a fitness center, and a pool. In the fall of 2012, Camino del Sol opened housing to incoming first-year students as an option instead of dorm living. Each housing community is served by ASUCI shuttles that regularly travel to the main campus. It has three stories and was designed with capacity for 1,198 beds, in 331 units ranging in size from 1,118-1,499 sq. ft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ktgy.com/work/uc-irvine-camino-del-sol/ KTGY architectural specifications]&lt;/ref&gt;

UCI off-campus housing options vary, based on a student's preferred living arrangements and budget. However, a common denominator for off-campus apartment housing in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] is the fact that most accommodations are maintained by [[The Irvine Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/search-results.html?submarket=Irvine |title=Apartments for Rent in Irvine {{!}} Irvine Company |website=www.irvinecompanyapartments.com |access-date=2019-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also true in nearby [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/search-results.html?submarket=Newport-Beach |title=Apartments for Rent in Newport Beach {{!}} Irvine Company |website=www.irvinecompanyapartments.com |access-date=2019-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tustin, California|Tustin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/search-results.html?submarket=Tustin |title=Apartments for Rent in Tustin {{!}} Irvine Company |website=www.irvinecompanyapartments.com |access-date=2019-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a lesser extent).

UC Irvine's sports teams are known as the [[Anteaters]] and the student body is known as Antourage. They currently participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I, as members of the [[Big West Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/schools/uc-irvine|title=UC Irvine {{!}} NCAA.com|website=NCAA.com|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpsports.org/members/mpsf-members.html|title=MPSPORTS.ORG - Members - Mountain Pacific Sports Federation|website=mpsports.org|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727190522/http://www.mpsports.org/members/mpsf-members.html|archive-date=2017-07-27|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the school's existence, the teams participated at the NCAA Division II level with great success as explained in the UC Irvine Anteaters page.  UC Irvine fields nationally competitive teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, track and field, volleyball and water polo. The university has won 28 national championships in nine different sports, and fielded 64 individual national champions, 53 Olympians and over 500 All-Americans.

The university's most recent NCAA Division I national championship was won by [[UC Irvine Anteaters men's volleyball|the men's volleyball team]] in 2013. UC Irvine men's volleyball won four national championships in 2007, 2009, 2012 and 2013.

UC Irvine won three NCAA Division I men's water polo titles, with championships in 1970, 1982 and 1989.

[[UC Irvine Anteaters baseball]] won back-to-back national championships at the NCAA College Division College World Series and the NCAA Division II College World Series in 1973 and 1974. Anteater baseball moved to the NCAA Division I level. The 2007 baseball team finished 3rd at the College World Series, and in 2009 the baseball team earned a No. 1 national ranking in NCAA Division I polls from Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball for the first time, as well as a national seed and the right to host an NCAA Regional. The 2014 baseball team returned to the College World Series and finished 5th.

Each May the city hosts the Brighton Festival and Brighton Fringe, the second largest arts festival in the UK (after [[Edinburgh Festival|Edinburgh]]). This includes processions such as the Children's Parade, outdoor spectaculars often involving pyrotechnics, and theatre, music and visual arts in venues throughout the city, some brought into this use exclusively for the festival. The earliest feature of the festival, [[Artists Open House|the Artists' Open Houses]], are homes of artists and craftspeople opened to the public as galleries, and usually selling the work of the occupants. Since 2002, these have been organised independently of the official Festival and Fringe.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Brighton has a [[horse-racing]] course, [[Brighton Racecourse]], with the unusual feature that when the full length of the course is to be used, some of the grass turf of the track has to be laid over the tar at the top of Wilson Avenue, a public road, which therefore has to be closed for the races. A [[greyhound racing]] circuit – the [[Brighton &amp; Hove Greyhound Stadium]] – in Hove is run by [[Gala Coral Group|Coral]], at which [[Motorcycle speedway]] racing was staged in 1928.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

[[Brighton Sailing Club]] has been operating since the 1870s.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

The Brighton and Hove [[Pétanque]] Club runs an annual triples, doubles and singles competition, informal KOs, winter and summer league, plus Open competitions with other clubs. The club is affiliated to Sussex Pétanque, the local region of the English Pétanque Association, so they can also play at a Regional and National level. The Peace Statue terrain is the official [[pétanque]] terrain situated on the seafront near the West Pier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhpetanque.org/|title= Brighton and Hove Pétanque Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brighton has two competitive swimming clubs: Brighton SC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightonsc.co.uk/|title= Brighton Swimming Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed in 1860 claims to be the oldest swimming club in England; and Brighton Dolphin SC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdsc.co.uk/|title= Brighton Dolphin Swimming Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in 1891 as Brighton Ladies Swimming.

Amateur track cycling is held at the [[Preston Park Velodrome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cycling at Preston Park Velodrome |url=https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/leisure-and-libraries/parks-and-green-spaces/cycling-preston-park-velodrome |website=www.brighton-hove.gov.uk |publisher=Brighton and Hove City Council |accessdate=23 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest velodrome in the UK, built in 1877.

Brighton has several railway stations, many bus routes, coach services and taxis. A Rapid Transport System has been under consideration for some years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.theargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1305605.0.transport_project_will_cut_journey_times.php

=== Road ===
Brighton is connected to the trunk road network by the [[A23 road|A23]] (London Road) northwards, and by two east–west routes: the [[A259 road|A259]] along the coast and the [[A27 road|A27]] [[South Coast Trunk Road|trunk route]] inland. The A23 joins the [[M23 motorway]] at [[Pease Pottage]] near [[Gatwick Airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRH49&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brighton Borough Council|1985|p=49.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A27 originally ran through the urban area along Old Shoreham Road and Lewes Road, but it now follows the route of the Brighton Bypass (final section opened in 1992) and the old alignment has become the A270. A bypass was first proposed in 1932, six routes were submitted for approval in 1973, and the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]] published its recommended route in 1980. Public inquiries took place in 1983 and 1987, construction started in 1989 and the first section—between London Road at [[Patcham]] and the road to [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]]—opened in summer 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB48&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=48.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1985 there were about 5,000 parking spaces in central Brighton. The largest car parks are at London Road, King Street, and the Churchill Square/Regency Road/Russell Road complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRH10&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brighton Borough Council|1985|p=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, a 520-space [[multi-storey car park]] was built beneath the central gardens of [[Regency Square, Brighton|Regency Square]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRH10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB273&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=273.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bus ===
Until [[Bus deregulation in Great Britain|deregulation]] in 1986, bus services in Brighton were provided by [[Southdown Motor Services]] and Brighton Borough Transport under a joint arrangement called &quot;Brighton Area Transport Services&quot;. Southdown were part of the nationalised [[National Bus Company (UK)|NBC]] group and were based at Freshfield Road in the [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]] area; Brighton Borough Transport were owned by the council and used the former tram depot at Lewes Road as their headquarters. Joint tickets were available and revenue was shared.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRH48+50&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brighton Borough Council|1985|pp=48, 50.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brighton &amp; Hove (bus company)|Brighton &amp; Hove Bus Company]], owned by the [[Go-Ahead Group]] since 1993, now runs most bus services in Brighton.

The only [[park and ride]] facility in Brighton is based at the [[Withdean Stadium]]. It does not offer a dedicated shuttle bus service: intending passengers must join the Brighton &amp; Hove Bus Company's route 27 service to [[Saltdean]]—which travels via Brighton railway station, the [[Clock Tower, Brighton|Clock Tower]] and [[Old Steine]]—and pay standard fares.&lt;ref name=&quot;BHCC-P&amp;R&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/travel-transport-and-road-safety/park-ride-1 |title=Park &amp; Ride |year=2013 |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove City Council |access-date=23 December 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130623194930/http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/travel-transport-and-road-safety/park-ride-1 |archive-date=23 June 2013 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 20-year City Plan released in January 2013 ruled out an official park-and-ride facility, stating it would be an &quot;inefficient use of public money, particularly in an era of declining car use&quot;.

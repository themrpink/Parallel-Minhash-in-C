===Rail===
{{see also|Havana Suburban Railway}}
Havana has a network of [[Havana Suburban Railway|suburban]], interurban and long-distance rail lines. The railways are nationalised and run by the FFCC ([[Ferrocarriles de Cuba]] – Railways of Cuba). The FFCC connects Havana with all the provinces of Cuba. The main railway stations are: [[Central Railway Station, Havana|Central Rail Station]], La Coubre Rail Station, [[Casablanca, Havana|Casablanca Station]], and Estación de Tulipán.

In 2004 the annual passenger volume was some 11&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=Censo_transporte&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.one.cu/aec2009/datos/13TRANSPORTE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822200546/http://www.one.cu/aec2009/datos/13TRANSPORTE.pdf |archive-date=August 22, 2011 }} National Statistics Census of Cuba – Transportation p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; but demand is estimated at two-and-a-half to three times this value, with the busiest route being between Havana and [[Santiago de Cuba]], some {{convert|836|km|mi}} apart by rail. In 2000 the Union de Ferrocarriles de Cuba bought French first class airconditioned coaches.

In the 1980s there were plans for a [[Rapid Transit|Metro system]] in Havana similar to [[Moscow Metro|Moscow]]'s, as a result of the [[Soviet Union]] influence in Cuba at the time. The studies of geology and finance made by Cuban, Czech and Soviet specialists were already well advanced in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Hav_metro&gt;[http://www.cubanet.org/sindical/news/y07/03290701.html Havana Metro] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119181627/http://www.cubanet.org/sindical/news/y07/03290701.html |date=January 19, 2012 }} Hace unos años parecía que la capital cubana tendría metro, cuando en la década de 1980 los estudios de geología y finanzas realizados por especialistas cubanos y soviéticos iban muy adelantados.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban press showed the construction project and the course route, linking municipalities and neighborhoods in the capital.&lt;ref name=Hav_metro/&gt; In the late 1980s the project had already begun, each mile of track was worth a million dollars at the time, but with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 the project was later dropped.&lt;ref name=Hav_metro/&gt;

===Interurban (tram)===
An interurban line, known as the [[Hershey Electric Railway]], built in 1917 runs from Casablanca (across the harbor from Old Havana) to Hershey and on to [[Matanzas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Conner Gorry|author2=David Stanley|title=Cuba|url=https://archive.org/details/cuba00gorr|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-120-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/cuba00gorr/page/142 142]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tramway===

Havana operated a tram system until 1952, which began as a [[horsecar]] system, '''Ferro Carril Urbano de la Habana''' in 1858,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tramz.com/cu/hb/hb.html&lt;/ref&gt; merged with rival coach operator in 1863 as '''Empresa del Ferro-Carril Urbano y Omnibus de La Habana''' and later electrified in 1900 under new foreign owners as '''Havana Electric Railway Company'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tramz.com/cu/hb/hbb.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ridership decline resulted in bankruptcy in 1950 with new owner '''Autobus Modernos SA''' abandoning systems in favor of buses and sold the remaining cars were sold to [[Matanzas]] in 1952.

===Ferry===
Ferries connect [[Old Havana]] with [[Regla]] and [[Casablanca, Havana|Casablanca]], leaving every 10–15 minutes from Muelle Luz (at the foot of Santa Clara Street). The fare is [[Cuban peso|CUP]] 0.20¢.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/cuba/havana/transport/getting-there-around#ixzz1r0WoNtBb |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228130924/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/cuba/havana/transport/getting-there-around |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-02-28 |title=&quot;Havana&quot;, Lonely Planet |publisher=Lonelyplanet.com |accessdate=2013-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roads===
The city's road network is quite extensive, and has broad avenues, main streets and major access roads to the city such as the Autopista Nacional (A1), [[Carretera Central (Cuba)|Carretera Central]] and [[Via Blanca (Cuba)|Via Blanca]]. The road network has been under construction and growth since the colonial era but is undergoing a major deterioration due to low maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transporte publico en La Habana|url=http://transporte-publico-en-la-habana.mundoviajero.net/|publisher=Mundo Viajero|accessdate=9 December 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Motorways''' ([[Controlled-access highway|autopistas]]) include:
* '''A1''' – Autopista Nacional, from Havana to [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]] and [[Sancti Spiritus, Cuba|Sancti Spiritus]], with additional short sections near [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]] and [[Guantanamo]]
* '''A4''' – Autopista Este-Oeste, from Havana to [[Pinar del Río]]
* '''[[Via Blanca (Cuba)|Via Blanca]]''', to [[Matanzas]] and [[Varadero]]
* '''Havana ring road''' ({{lang-es|Primer anillo|links=no}}), which starts at a [[:es:Túnel de La Habana|tunnel]] under the entrance to [[Havana Harbor]]
* '''Autopista del Mediodia''', from Havana to [[San Antonio de los Baños]]
* an autopista from Havana to [[Melena del Sur]]
* an autopista from Havana to [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]]

==Administration==
The governor is [[Reinaldo García Zapata]],&lt;ref name=&quot;eleccionesencuba.cu&quot;/&gt; he was elected on January, 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;tribuna.cu&quot;/&gt;

The city is administered by a city-provincial council, with a governor as chief administrative officer,&lt;ref&gt;[https://apnews.com/2fad9d6d53fa47b1a584e71fc5874506] Cuba elige gobernadores ajustándose a nueva Constitución&lt;/ref&gt; thus Havana functions as both a city and a [[province]]. The city has little autonomy and is dependent upon the national government, particularly, for much of its budgetary and overall political direction.

[[File:Comité Central PCC.jpg|thumb|left|[[Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba|Comite Central del Partido Comunista de Cuba]] (Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party).]]
The national government is headquartered in Havana and plays an extremely visible role in the city's life. Moreover, the all-embracing authority of many national institutions has led to a declining role for the city government, which, nevertheless, still provides much of the essential services and has competences in education, health care, city public transport, garbage collection, small industry, agriculture, etc.

Voters elect delegates to Municipal Assemblies in competitive elections. There is only one political party, the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]], but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates in turn elect members of the Provincial Assembly, which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president functions as the Mayor. There are direct elections for deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local municipal delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. In addition, there is participation from &quot;mass organisations&quot; and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.

Havana city borders are contiguous with the [[Mayabeque Province]] on the south and east and to [[Artemisa Province]] on the west, since former [[La Habana Province]] (rural) was abolished in 2010.

{{Further|Education in Cuba}}
The national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba. The schools are of varying quality and education is free and compulsory at all levels except higher learning, which is also free.

The [[University of Havana]], located in the [[Vedado]] section of Havana, was established in 1728 and was regarded as a leading institution of higher learning in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Soon after the Revolution, the university, as well as all other educational institutions, were nationalized. Since then several other universities have opened, like the [[Polytechnic José Antonio Echeverría|Higher Learning Polytechnic Institute José Antonio Echeverría]] where the vast majority of today's Cuban engineers are taught.

The [[Cuban National Ballet School]] with 4,350 students is one of the largest ballet schools in the world and the most prestigious [[ballet]] school in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|es}} [http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html La Escuela Nacional de Ballet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000202/http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html |date=2009-06-23 }} – La Escuela desarrolla una experiencia única en el mundo, enmarcada en la Batalla de Ideas.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospitals in Havana are run by the national government, and citizens are assigned hospitals and clinics to which they may go for attention.

===Services===
Utility services are under the control of several nationalized state enterprises that have developed since the [[Cuban revolution]]. Water, electricity, and sewage service are administered in this fashion. Electricity is supplied by generators that are fueled with oil. Much of the original power plant installations, which operated before the Revolutionary government assumed control, have become somewhat outdated. Electrical blackouts occurred, prompting the national government in 1986 to allocate the equivalent of $25,000,000 to modernize the electrical system.

==Sports==
Many Cubans are avid sports fans who particularly favour baseball. Havana's team in the [[Cuban National Series]] is [[Industriales]]. FCBA. The city has several large sports stadiums, the largest one is the [[Estadio Latinoamericano]]. Admission to sporting events is generally free, and impromptu games are played in neighborhoods throughout the city. Social clubs at the beaches provide facilities for water sports and include restaurants and dance halls.

'''Robert Hooke''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|h|ʊ|k}}; {{OldStyleDate|28 July|1635|18 July}}&amp;nbsp;– 3 March 1703) was an English [[natural philosopher|scientist]] and architect, a [[polymath]], recently called &quot;England's [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chapman, Alan|year=1996|title=England's Leonardo: Robert Hooke (1635–1703) and the art of experiment in Restoration England|url=http://home.clara.net/rod.beavon/leonardo.htm|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain|volume=67|pages=239–275|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306084446/http://home.clara.net/rod.beavon/leonardo.htm|archivedate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, using a microscope, was the first to visualize a microorganism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Howard Gest, [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15209075 &quot;The discovery of microorganisms by Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, Fellows of The Royal Society&quot;], ''[[Notes Rec R Soc Lond]]'', 2004 May;'''58'''(2):187–201.

Hooke was also a member of the [[Royal Society]] and since 1662 was its curator of experiments. Hooke was also [[Gresham Professor of Geometry|Professor of Geometry at Gresham College]].

As an assistant to physical scientist [[Robert Boyle]], Hooke built the vacuum pumps used in Boyle's experiments on [[gas law]], and himself conducted experiments. In 1673, Hooke built the earliest [[Gregorian telescope]], and then he observed the rotations of the planets [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Hooke's 1665 book ''[[Micrographia]]'' spurred microscopic investigations.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Thus observing microscopic fossils, Hooke endorsed biological [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Drake, Ellen Tan | chapter = Hooke's Ideas of the Terraqueous Globe and a Theory of Evolution | editor = Michael Cooper | editor2 = Michael Hunter | title = Robert Hooke: Tercentennial Studies | publisher = Ashgate | year = 2006 | location = Burlington, Vermont | pages = 135–149 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5365-3 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=P0-XfTTcwwQC&amp;pg=PA135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Restless Genius: Robert Hooke and His Earthly Thoughts | year = 1996 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-506695-1 | author = Drake, Ellen Tan | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/restlessgeniusro0000drak }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating in [[optics]], specifically light [[refraction]], he inferred a [[wave theory of light]]. And his is the first recorded hypothesis of heat expanding matter, air's composition by small particles at larger distances, and heat as energy.

In physics, he approximated experimental confirmation that [[gravity]] heeds an [[inverse square law]], and first hypothesised such a relation in planetary motion, too, a principle furthered and formalised by [[Isaac Newton]] in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 15th Edition, vol.6 p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Priority over this insight contributed to the rivalry between Hooke and Newton, who thus antagonized Hooke's legacy. In [[geology]] and [[paleontology]], Hooke originated the theory of a terraqueous globe, disputed the literally Biblical view of the Earth's age, hypothesised the extinction of organism species, and argued that fossils atop hills and mountains had become elevated by geological processes.&lt;ref name=Gribbin&gt;{{Cite book |title=Out of the shadow of a giant: Hooke, Halley and the birth of British science |last=1946- |first=Gribbin, John &amp; Mary |isbn=978-0008220594 |location=London |oclc=966239842|year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke's pioneering work in land surveying and in [[cartography|mapmaking]] aided development of the first modern plan-form map, although his grid-system plan for London was rejected in favour of rebuilding along existing routes.  Even so, Hooke was key in devising for London a set of planning controls that remain influential.

==Life and works==
[[File:Hooke-microscope.png|upright|thumb|Hooke's [[microscope]], from an engraving in ''Micrographia'']]

Much of what is known of Hooke's early life comes from an autobiography that he commenced in 1696 but never completed. [[Richard Waller (d. 1715)|Richard Waller]] mentions it in his introduction to ''The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S.'', printed in 1705. In the chapter ''Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits'', Hooke argues that [[John Dee]] made use of [[Johannes Trithemius|Trithemian]] [[steganography]], to conceal his communication with [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xVTAAAAcAAJ|title=The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke|page=203|author=Robert Hooke|year=1705|publisher=Richard Waller, London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Waller, along with [[John Ward (academic)|John Ward]]'s ''Lives of the Gresham Professors'' (with a list of his major works)&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book

===Early life===
Robert Hooke was born in 1635 in [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] to Cecily Gyles and John Hooke, an [[Anglican priest]], the curate of [[All Saints' Church, Freshwater|Freshwater's Church of All Saints]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jardine23&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jardine|first=Lisa|title=The Curious Life of Robert Hooke: The Man who Measured London|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|year=2003|isbn=978-0-00-714944-5|edition=1st|location=New York|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Father John Hooke's two brothers, Robert's paternal uncles, were also ministers. A royalist, John Hooke likely was among a group that went to pay respects to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] as he escaped to the Isle of Wight. Expected to join the church, Robert, too, would become a staunch monarchist. Robert was the youngest, by seven years, of four siblings, two boys and two girls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/ric.martin/vectis/hookeweb/sggg.htm|title=The Tragedy of Robert Hooke's Brother|last=Martin|first=Rob|year=2000|access-date=9 March 2010|quote=Robert is given forty pounds, a chest and all the books|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418154423/http://freespace.virgin.net/ric.martin/vectis/hookeweb/sggg.htm|archive-date=18 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their father led a local school as well, yet at least partly homeschooled Robert, frail in health. The young Robert Hooke was fascinated by observation, mechanical works, and drawing. He dismantled a brass clock and built a wooden replica that reportedly worked &quot;well enough&quot;. He made his own drawing materials from coal, chalk, and ruddle ([[iron ore]]).&lt;ref&gt;His father had speculated that he might become a [[watchmaker]] or [[limner]] (a decorator of [[illuminated manuscript]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his father's death in 1648, Robert inherited 40 pounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;JOCEFR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Hooke.html|title=Hooke biography|author1=O'Connor, J J|author2=Robertson, E F|name-list-style=amp|date=August 2002|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics University of St Andrews, Scotland|access-date=9 March 2010|quote=He was left £40 by his father, together with all his father's books (the often quoted figure of £100 is a much repeated error)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716214513/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Hooke.html|archive-date=16 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|About £{{inflation|UK|40|1648|r=-2|fmt=c}} today. He was 13 years old.}} He took this to London with the aim of beginning an apprenticeship, and studied briefly with Samuel Cowper and [[Peter Lely]], but was persuaded instead to enter [[Westminster School]] by its headmaster Dr. [[Richard Busby]]. Hooke quickly mastered Latin and Greek,&lt;ref name=&quot;JOCEFR&quot; /&gt; studied Hebrew some, mastered [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']],&lt;ref name=&quot;JOCEFR&quot; /&gt; learned to play the [[pipe organ|organ]],{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} and began his lifelong study of [[mechanics]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Hooke may have been among a group of students that Busby taught in parallel to the school's main courses. Contemporary accounts call him &quot;not much seen&quot; in school, apparently true of others positioned similarly.  Busby, an ardent and outspoken royalist, was by all accounts{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} trying to preserve the nascent spirit of scientific inquiry that had begun to flourish in the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] but which was at odds with the literal Biblical teachings of [[the Protectorate]].  To Busby and his select students, the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]] was a framework to support the spirit of inquiry into God's work: those who were able to do so were destined by God to explore and study His creation.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

===Oxford===

In 1653, Hooke (who had also undertaken a course of twenty lessons on the [[pipe organ|organ]]) secured a chorister's place at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].&lt;ref name=Jardine23 /&gt; He was employed as a &quot;chemical assistant&quot; to Dr [[Thomas Willis]], for whom Hooke developed a great admiration.  There he met the [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]] [[Robert Boyle]], and gained employment as his assistant from about 1655 to 1662, constructing, operating, and demonstrating Boyle's &quot;machina Boyleana&quot; or air pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Shapin, Steven |author2=Schaffer, Simon | title = Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle and the Experimental Life | location = Princeton | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1985 | chapter-url = http://www.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/ShapinSchaffer/ShapinSchaffer_Seeing.html | chapter = 2 | isbn = 978-0-691-08393-3 | accessdate = 11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1662 or 1663 that was awarded a [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/robert-hooke/#gsc.tab=0 Robert Hooke]'' {{ISBN|978-0-756-53317-5}} p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1659 Hooke described some elements of a method of heavier-than-air flight to Wilkins, but concluded that human muscles were insufficient to the task.

Hooke himself characterised his Oxford days as the foundation of his lifelong passion for science, and the friends he made there were of paramount importance to him throughout his career, particularly [[Christopher Wren]].  Wadham was then under the guidance of [[John Wilkins]], who had a profound impact on Hooke and those around him.  Wilkins was also a Royalist, and acutely conscious of the turmoil and uncertainty of the times.  There was a sense of urgency in preserving the scientific work which they perceived as being threatened by the Protectorate.  Wilkins' &quot;philosophical meetings&quot; in his study were clearly important, though few records survive except for the experiments Boyle conducted in 1658 and published in 1660.  This group went on to form the nucleus of the [[Royal Society]].  Hooke developed an air pump for Boyle's experiments based on the pump of [[Ralph Greatorex]], which was considered, in Hooke's words, &quot;too gross to perform any great matter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Fulton, John F. | title = The Honourable Robert Boyle, F.R.S.

It has been suggested that Hooke probably made the observations and may well have developed the mathematics of [[Boyle's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Gunther, Robert | title = Early Science in Oxford | volume = 7 | publisher = privately printed | date= 1923–1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gribbin /&gt;  Regardless, it is clear that Hooke was a valued assistant to Boyle and the two retained a mutual high regard.

A chance surviving copy of Willis's pioneering {{lang|la|De anima brutorum}}, a gift from the author, was chosen by Hooke from Wilkins' library on his death as a memento at [[John Tillotson]]'s invitation.  This book is now in the [[Wellcome Library]].  The book and its inscription in Hooke's hand are a testament to the lasting influence of Wilkins and his circle on the young Hooke.

===Royal Society===
The [[Royal Society]] was founded in 1660, and in April 1661 the society debated a short tract on the rising of water in slender glass pipes, in which Hooke reported that the height water rose was related to the bore of the pipe (due to what is now termed [[capillary action]]).  His explanation of this phenomenon was subsequently published in ''Micrography Observ.'' issue 6, in which he also explored the nature of &quot;the fluidity of gravity&quot;. On 5 November 1661, Sir [[Robert Moray]] proposed that a Curator be appointed to furnish the society with Experiments, and this was unanimously passed with Hooke being named.  His appointment was made on 12 November, with thanks recorded to Dr. Boyle for releasing him to the Society's employment.

In 1664, Sir John Cutler settled an annual gratuity of fifty pounds on the Society for the founding of a ''Mechanick Lecture'',{{efn|About £{{inflation|UK|50|1664|r=-2|fmt=c}} today.}} and the Fellows appointed Hooke to this task.  On 27 June 1664 he was confirmed to the office, and on 11 January 1665 was named ''Curator by Office'' for life with an additional salary of £30 to Cutler's annuity.{{efn
|About £{{inflation|UK|30|1665|r=-2|fmt=c}} today. Sir John Cutler and Hooke were at odds in the following years over monies due to Hooke. Following Cutler's death, Hooke enlisted the aid of friends of the Cutler family, including Master of [[The Haberdashers Company]] Sir [[Richard Levett]], for whom Hooke was involved in a building commission, to help recover the funds owed by Cutler.&lt;ref name=Jardine23 /&gt;}}

Hooke's role at the Royal Society was to demonstrate experiments from his own methods or at the suggestion of members.  Among his earliest demonstrations were discussions of the nature of air, the implosion of glass bubbles which had been sealed with comprehensive hot air, and demonstrating that the ''Pabulum vitae'' and ''flammae'' were one and the same. He also demonstrated that a dog could be kept alive with its thorax opened, provided air was pumped in and out of its lungs, and noting the difference between [[venous]] and [[arterial]] blood.  There were also experiments on the subject of gravity, the falling of objects, the weighing of bodies and measuring of [[barometric pressure]] at different heights, and [[pendulum]]s up to {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}.

Instruments were devised to measure a [[second of arc]] in the movement of the sun or other stars, to measure the strength of [[gunpowder]], and in particular an engine to cut teeth for watches, much finer than could be managed by hand, an invention which was, by Hooke's death, in constant use.&lt;ref name=Waller&gt;{{Cite book|last = Waller | first = Richard | title = The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S.|publisher=Sam.

In later life, Farnsworth invented a small [[nuclear fusion]] device, the Farnsworth–Hirsch [[fusor]], employing [[inertial electrostatic confinement]] (IEC). It was not a practical device for generating [[nuclear power]], though it provides a viable source of neutrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;fusor3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11003520 | volume=53 | issue=4–5 | title=The IEC star-mode fusion neutron source for NAA--status and next-step designs | date=October 2000 | journal=Appl Radiat Isot | pages=779–83  | last1 = Miley | first1 = GH | last2 = Sved | first2 = J | doi=10.1016/s0969-8043(00)00215-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design of this device has been the inspiration for other fusion approaches, including the [[Polywell]] reactor concept.&lt;ref name=&quot;fusor4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://askmar.com/ConferenceNotes/Should%20Google%20Go%20Nuclear.pdf |first=Robert W. |last=Bussard |authorlink=Robert W.

==Early life==
Farnsworth was born August 19, 1906
, the eldest of five children&lt;ref name=videopt1p71&gt;{{cite news | title = Zworykin vs. Farnsworth, Part I: The Strange Story of TV's Troubled Origins | url =https://www.scribd.com/doc/146221929/Zworykin-v-Farnsworth-Part-1-The-Strange-Story-of-TV-s-Troubled-Origin | authorlink = Frank Lovece | first= Frank | last= Lovece | work = Video | date = August 1985 | page = 71 | accessdate = May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Lewis Edwin Farnsworth and Serena Amanda Bastian, a [[Latter-day Saint]] couple living in a small log cabin built by Lewis's father near [[Beaver, Utah]]. In 1918, the family moved to a relative's {{convert|240|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} ranch near [[Rigby, Idaho]],&lt;ref name=alumni&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.byhigh.org/History/Farnsworth/PhiloT1924.html | title= Philo Taylor Farnsworth: Mathematician, Inventor, Father of Television | publisher = Brigham Young High School Alumni | accessdate=April 24, 2015}} Article edited by Kent M. Farnsworth, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; where his father supplemented his farming income by hauling freight with his horse-drawn wagon. Philo was excited to find that his new home was wired for electricity, with a Delco generator providing power for lighting and farm machinery. He was a quick student in mechanical and electrical technology, repairing the troublesome generator. He found a burned-out electric motor among some items discarded by the previous tenants and rewound the [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]]; he converted his mother's hand-powered washing machine into an electric-powered one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatzkin7-10&quot;&gt;Schatzkin, Paul (2002), ''The Boy Who Invented Television''. Silver Spring, Maryland: Teamcom Books, pp. 7–10. {{ISBN|1-928791-30-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an early interest in electronics after his first telephone conversation with a distant relative, and he discovered a large cache of technology magazines in the attic of their new home.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElmaFarns1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Farnsworth | first = Elma G. | year = 1990 | title = Distant Vision: Romance and Discovery of an Invisible Frontier | location = [[Salt Lake City]] | publisher = PemberlyKent Publishers, Inc. | isbn = 978-0-9623276-0-5 | page = #? | url = https://archive.org/details/distantvisionrom00farn }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won $25 in a pulp-magazine contest for inventing a magnetized car lock.&lt;ref name=videopt1p71 /&gt; Farnsworth was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mormon Faith in America&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Maxine |last1=Hanks | authorlink = Maxine Hanks |first2=Jean Kinney |last2=Williams |year=2015|title= Mormon Faith in America|isbn= 978-1438140377|page=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Terryl L.|last1= Givens | authorlink = Terryl Givens |first2= Philip L. |last2=Barlow | author2link = Philip Barlow |year=2015|title=The Oxford Handbook of Mormonism| page= 10| isbn =  978-0-1904-6350-2 |quote=Philo Farnsworth, one of several inventors of television, was another Latter-day Saint media engineer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farnsworth excelled in chemistry and physics at [[Rigby High School]]. He asked science teacher Justin Tolman for advice about an electronic television system that he was contemplating; he provided the teacher with sketches and diagrams covering several blackboards to show how it might be accomplished electronically, and Tolman encouraged him to develop his ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouw1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnouw|first=Erik | authorlink = Erik Barnouw|title=Tube of Plenty: The Evolution of American Television|url=https://archive.org/details/tubeofplentyevol00barn|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the drawings that he did on a blackboard for his chemistry teacher was recalled and reproduced for a patent interference case between Farnsworth and [[RCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Godfrey| first = Donald| url = http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/farnsworthp/farnsworthp.htm| title = Farnsworth, Philo: U.S. Inventor| publisher = [[The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]| accessdate = July 5, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070713085015/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/farnsworthp/farnsworthp.htm| archive-date = July 13, 2007| url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the family moved to [[Provo, Utah]], and Farnsworth attended [[Brigham Young High School]] that fall. His father died of pneumonia in January 1924 at age 58, and Farnsworth assumed responsibility for sustaining the family while finishing high school.&lt;ref name=alumni /&gt; After graduating BYHS in June 1924, he applied to the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis]], [[Maryland]], where he earned the nation's second-highest score on academy recruiting tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElmaFarns1&quot;/&gt; However, he was already thinking ahead to his television projects; he learned that the government would own his patents if he stayed in the military, so he obtained an honorable discharge within months of joining&lt;ref name=&quot;ElmaFarns1&quot;/&gt; under a provision in which the eldest child in a fatherless family could be excused from military service to provide for his family. He returned to Provo and enrolled at [[Brigham Young University]], but he was not allowed by the faculty to attend their advanced science classes based upon policy considerations.&lt;ref name= alumni /&gt; He attended anyway and made use of the university's research labs, and he earned a Junior Radio-Trician certification from the [[National Radio Institute]], and full certification in 1925.&lt;ref name=alumni /&gt; While attending college, he met Provo High School student Elma &quot;Pem&quot; Gardner&lt;ref name=alumni /&gt; (February 25, 1908 – April 27, 2006),&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/arts/television/03farnsworth.html | title =  Elma Gardner Farnsworth, 98, Who Helped Husband Develop TV, Dies | work = [[The New York Times]]  | date = May 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he eventually married.

Farnsworth worked while his sister Agnes took charge of the family home and the second-floor boarding house, with the help of a cousin living with the family. The Farnsworths later moved into half of a duplex, with family friends the Gardners moving into the other side when it became vacant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatzkin20-1&quot;&gt;Schatzkin, Paul (2002), ''The Boy Who Invented Television''. Silver Spring, Maryland: Teamcom Books, pp. 20–21. {{ISBN|1-928791-30-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a close friendship with Pem's brother Cliff Gardner, who shared his interest in electronics, and the two moved to [[Salt Lake City]] to start a radio repair business.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElmaFarns1&quot;/&gt; The business failed, and Gardner returned to Provo.

Farnsworth remained in Salt Lake City and became acquainted with Leslie Gorrell and George Everson, a pair of San Francisco philanthropists who were then conducting a Salt Lake City [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]] fund-raising campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatzkin&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Schatzkin | first = Paul | url = http://www.farnovision.com/chronicles/tfc-secret.html | title = The Farnsworth Chronicles | publisher = Farnovision.com | accessdate = September 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EFarnsworth6&quot;&gt;Farnsworth, Elma G., p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; They agreed to fund his early television research with an initial $6,000 in backing,&lt;ref name=videopt2p97&gt;{{cite news | title = Zworykin vs. Farnsworth, Part II: TV's Founding Fathers Finally Meet — In the Lab | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/146222148/Zworykin-v-Farnsworth-Part-2-TV-s-Founding-Fathers-Finally-Meet-in-the-Lab | authorlink = Frank Lovece | first= Frank | last= Lovece | work = Video | date = September 1985 | page = 97 | accessdate = May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and set up a laboratory in Los Angeles for Farnsworth to carry out his experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/philo_farnsworth.html |title=Early Electronic TV |accessdate=September 21, 2008 | publisher=Early Television Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farnsworth married Pem&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2006&quot; /&gt; on May 27, 1926,&lt;ref name=alumni /&gt; and the two traveled to [[Berkeley, California]], in a Pullman coach. They rented a house at 2910 Derby Street, from which he applied for his first television patent, which was granted on August 26, 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElmaFarns1&quot;/&gt; By that time they had moved across the bay to San Francisco, where Farnsworth set up his new lab at 202 Green Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfmuseum&quot; /&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Farnsworth cvc 500h 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Philo T. Farnsworth (Avati)|Philo T. Farnsworth]]'' in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]], U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.]]
A few months after arriving in California, Farnsworth was prepared to show his models and drawings to a patent attorney who was nationally recognized as an authority on [[Electromagnetism|electrophysics]]. Everson and Gorrell agreed that Farnsworth should apply for patents for his designs, a decision that proved crucial in later disputes with [[RCA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier's&quot;&gt;''Collier's Magazine'', October 3, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Most television systems in use at the time used image scanning devices (&quot;[[Rasterisation|rasterizers]]&quot;) employing rotating &quot;[[Nipkow disk]]s&quot; comprising a spinning disk with holes arranged in spiral patterns such that they swept across an image in a succession of short arcs while focusing the light they captured on [[photoelectric effect|photosensitive]] elements, thus producing a varying electrical signal corresponding to the variations in [[intensity (physics)|light intensity]]. Farnsworth recognized the limitations of the mechanical systems, and that an all-electronic scanning system could produce a superior image for transmission to a receiving device.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatzkin14-15&quot;&gt;Schatzkin, Paul (2002), ''The Boy Who Invented Television''. Silver Spring, Maryland: Teamcom Books, pp. 14–15. {{ISBN|1-928791-30-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 1927, Farnsworth's [[image dissector]] camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, to a receiver in another room of his laboratory at 202 Green Street in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=videopt2p97 /&gt; Pem Farnsworth recalled in 1985 that her husband broke the stunned silence of his lab assistants by saying, &quot;There you are – electronic television!&quot;&lt;ref name=videopt2p97 /&gt; The source of the image was a glass slide, backlit by an [[arc lamp]]. An extremely bright source was required because of the low light sensitivity of the design. By 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfmuseum&quot;/&gt; His backers had demanded to know when they would see dollars from the invention;&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;[[Evan Schwartz (author)|Schwartz, Evan I.]], ''The Last Lone Inventor: A Tale of Genius, Deceit &amp; the Birth of Television,'' [[HarperCollins]], 2002. {{ISBN|0-06-621069-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the first image shown was, appropriately, a dollar sign. In 1929, the design was further improved by elimination of a [[motor-generator]]; so the television system now had no mechanical parts.  That year Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images using his television system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Pem.

Many inventors had built [[History of television#Mechanical television|electromechanical television]] systems before Farnsworth's seminal contribution, but Farnsworth designed and built the world's first working [[History of television#Electronic television|all-electronic television]] system, employing electronic scanning in both the pickup and display devices. He first demonstrated his system to the press on September 3, 1928,&lt;ref name=&quot;sfmuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/philo.html |title=Philo Taylor Farnsworth (1906–1971)|publisher=[[The Museum of the City of San Francisco]]|accessdate= July 15, 2009|archivedate=November 6, 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106124048/http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/philo.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EFarnsworth108&quot;&gt;Farnsworth, Elma G., p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; and to the public at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]] on August 25, 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHistoryofTV2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last =Abramson | first=Albert | year = 1987 | title = The History of Television, 1880 to 1941 | publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Co.]] | location = [[Jefferson, North Carolina]] | page = 209 | isbn = 978-0-89950-284-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, RCA recruited [[Vladimir Zworykin]]—who had tried, unsuccessfully, to develop his own all-electronic television system at [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] in [[Pittsburgh]] since 1923&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHistoryofTV4&quot;&gt;Abramson, pp. 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt;—to lead its television development department. Before leaving his old employer, Zworykin visited Farnsworth's laboratory, and was sufficiently impressed with the performance of the Image Dissector that he reportedly had his team at Westinghouse make several copies of the device for experimentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHistoryofTV6&quot;&gt;Abramson, pp. 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt; Zworykin later abandoned research on the Image Dissector, which at the time required extremely bright illumination of its subjects, and turned his attention to what became the [[Iconoscope]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHistoryofTV5&quot;&gt;Abramson, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1970s series of videotaped interviews, Zworykin recalled that, &quot;Farnsworth was closer to this thing you're using now [i.e., a video camera] than anybody, because he used the cathode-ray tube for transmission. But, Farnsworth didn't have the mosaic [of discrete light elements], he didn't have storage. Therefore, [picture] definition was very low.... But he was very proud, and he stuck to his method.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lovece, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/146222148/Zworykin-v-Farnsworth-Part-2-TV-s-Founding-Fathers-Finally-Meet-in-the-Lab &quot;Part II&quot;, p. 98]&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Zworykin's statement, Farnsworth's patent number 2,087,683 for the Image Dissector (filed April 26, 1933) features the [[Video camera tube#Iconoscope|&quot;charge storage plate&quot;]] invented by Tihanyi in 1928 and a &quot;low velocity&quot; method of electron scanning, also describes &quot;discrete particles&quot; whose &quot;potential&quot; is manipulated and &quot;saturated&quot; to varying degrees depending on their velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Schatzkin, Paul. [http://www.farnovision.com/chronicles/tfc-who_invented_what.html &quot;Reconciling The Historical Origins of Electronic Video&quot;, The Farnsworth Chronicles, excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt; Farnsworth's patent numbers 2,140,695 and 2,233,888 are for a &quot;charge storage dissector&quot; and &quot;charge storage amplifier,&quot; respectively.

In 1931, [[David Sarnoff]] of RCA offered to buy Farnsworth's patents for [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000, with the stipulation that he become an employee of RCA, but Farnsworth refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everson1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Everson | first = George | year = 1949 | title = The Story of Television: The Life of Philo T.

Farnsworth had lost two interference claims to Zworykin in 1928, but this time he prevailed and the [[U.S. Patent Office]] rendered a decision in 1934 awarding priority of the invention of the image dissector to Farnsworth. RCA lost a subsequent appeal, but litigation over a variety of issues continued for several years with Sarnoff finally agreeing to pay Farnsworth royalties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Postman&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/farnsworth.html | authorlink = Neil Postman | last = Postman | first= Neil | title = The ''Time'' 100: Scientists &amp; Thinkers: Philo Farnsworth | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = March 29, 1999 | accessdate = July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In 1932, while in England to raise money for his legal battles with RCA, Farnsworth met with [[John Logie Baird]], a Scottish inventor who had given the world's first public demonstration of a working television system in London in 1926, using an electro-mechanical imaging system, and who was seeking to develop electronic television receivers. Baird demonstrated his mechanical system for Farnsworth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Godfrey|first=D. G.|year=2001|title=Philo T. Farnsworth: The Father of Television.

In May 1933, Philco severed its relationship with Farnsworth because, said Everson, &quot;it [had] become apparent that Philo's aim at establishing a broad patent structure through research [was] not identical with the production program of Philco.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHistoryofTV1&quot;&gt;Abramson, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; In Everson's view the decision was mutual and amicable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everson7&quot;&gt;Everson, pp. 135–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Farnsworth set up shop at 127 East Mermaid Lane in Philadelphia, and in 1934 held the first public exhibition of his device at the Franklin Institute in that city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Philo T.

After sailing to Europe in 1934, Farnsworth secured an agreement with Goerz-Bosch-Fernseh in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier's&quot;/&gt; Some image dissector cameras were used to broadcast the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic Games]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHistoryofTV3&quot;&gt;Abramson, pp. 232–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farnsworth returned to his laboratory, and by 1936 his company was regularly transmitting entertainment programs on an experimental basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everson2&quot;&gt;Everson, pp. 199–211.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, while working with [[University of Pennsylvania]] [[biology|biologists]], Farnsworth developed a process to sterilize milk using radio waves.&lt;ref name=&quot;db3-sql.staff.library.utah.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://db3-sql.staff.library.utah.edu/lucene/Manuscripts/null/Ms0648.xml/complete | title = The Philo T. and Elma G.

In 1936 he attracted the attention of ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', which described his work in glowing terms. &quot;One of those amazing facts of modern life that just don't seem possible&amp;nbsp;– namely, electrically scanned television that seems destined to reach your home next year, was largely given to the world by a nineteen-year-old boy from Utah&amp;nbsp;... Today, barely thirty years old he is setting the specialized world of science on its ears.&quot;

In 1938, Farnsworth established the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], with E. A. Nicholas as president and himself as director of research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everson1&quot;/&gt; In September 1939, after a more than decade-long legal battle, RCA finally conceded to a multi-year licensing agreement concerning Farnsworth's 1927 patent for television totaling $1&amp;nbsp;million. RCA was then free, after showcasing electronic television at [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] on April 20, 1939, to sell electronic television cameras to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everson1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHistoryofTV2&quot;/&gt;{{rp|250–54}}

Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation was purchased by [[International Telephone and Telegraph]] (ITT) in 1951. During his time at ITT, Farnsworth worked in a basement laboratory known as &quot;the cave&quot; on Pontiac Street in Fort Wayne. From there he introduced a number of breakthrough concepts, including a defense early warning signal, [[submarine]] detection devices, [[radar]] calibration equipment and an [[infrared telescope]]. &quot;Philo was a very deep person – tough to engage in conversation, because he was always thinking about what he could do next&quot;, said Art Resler, an ITT photographer who documented Farnsworth's work in pictures.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt; One of Farnsworth's most significant contributions at ITT was the [[Plan Position Indicator|PPI Projector]], an enhancement on the iconic &quot;circular sweep&quot; [[radar display]], which allowed safe air traffic control from the ground. This system developed in the 1950s was the forerunner of today's [[air traffic control]] systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;db3-sql.staff.library.utah.edu&quot;/&gt;

In addition to his electronics research, ITT management agreed to nominally fund Farnsworth's [[nuclear fusion]] research. He and staff members invented and refined a series of fusion reaction tubes called &quot;[[fusor]]s&quot;. For scientific reasons unknown to Farnsworth and his staff, the necessary reactions lasted no longer than thirty seconds. In December 1965, ITT came under pressure from its board of directors to terminate the expensive project and sell the Farnsworth subsidiary. It was only due to the urging of president [[Harold Geneen]] that the 1966 budget was accepted, extending ITT's fusion research for an additional year. The stress associated with this managerial ultimatum, however, caused Farnsworth to suffer a relapse. A year later he was terminated and eventually allowed medical retirement.&lt;ref name=Utah-bio&gt;{{cite web| url =http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/UU_EAD,2160| archive-url =https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131021170353/http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/ref/collection/UU_EAD/id/2160| url-status =dead| archive-date =October 21, 2013| title =Biography of Philo Taylor Farnsworth| publisher =University of Utah Marriott Library Special Collections| accessdate =July 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1967, Farnsworth and his family moved back to Utah to continue his fusion research at [[Brigham Young University]], which presented him with an honorary doctorate. The university also offered him office space and an underground concrete bunker for the project. Realizing ITT would dismantle its fusion lab, Farnsworth invited staff members to accompany him to [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], as team members in Philo T. Farnsworth Associates (PTFA). By late 1968, the associates began holding regular business meetings and PTFA was underway. They promptly secured a contract with the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]], and more possibilities were within reach—but financing stalled for the $24,000 a month required for salaries and equipment rental.&lt;ref name=Utah-bio/&gt;

By [[Christmas]] 1970, PTFA had failed to secure the necessary financing, and the Farnsworths had sold all their own ITT stock and cashed in Philo's [[life insurance]] policy to maintain organizational stability. The [[underwriter]] had failed to provide the financial backing that was to have supported the organization during its critical first year. The banks called in all outstanding loans, [[repossession]] notices were placed on anything not previously sold, and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] put a lock on the laboratory door until delinquent taxes were paid. In January 1971, PTFA disbanded. Farnsworth had begun abusing alcohol in his later years,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Largo]] (2006). ''Final Exits: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of How We Die'' (New York: [[Harper Collins]], {{ISBN|978-0-06-081741-1}}) p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result became seriously ill with [[pneumonia]], and died on March 11, 1971.&lt;ref name=Utah-bio/&gt;

Farnsworth's wife Elma Gardner &quot;Pem&quot; Farnsworth fought for decades after his death to assure his place in history. Farnsworth always gave her equal credit for creating television, saying, &quot;my wife and I started this TV.&quot; She died on April 27, 2006, at age 98.&lt;ref name=&quot;heraldextra.com&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper|url= http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/177009/ |last=Hummel|first= Debbie|title=Elma Farnsworth, widow of TV pioneer, dies at 98|agency=[[Associated Press]|via=Daily Herald|location=Provo, Utah|date= April 28, 2006|page= D5|archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060515161238/http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/177009/|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inventor and wife were survived by two sons, Russell (then living in [[New York City]]), and Kent (then living in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;heraldextra.com&quot;/&gt;

==Inventions==

===Electronic television===
Farnsworth worked out the principle of the image dissector in the summer of 1921, not long before his 15th birthday, and demonstrated the first working version on September 7, 1927, having turned 21 the previous August. A farm boy, his inspiration for scanning an image as series of lines came from the back-and-forth motion used to plow a field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatzkin17-9&quot;&gt;Schatzkin, Paul (2002), ''The Boy Who Invented Television''. Silver Spring, Maryland: Teamcom Books, pp. 17–19. {{ISBN|1-928791-30-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatzkin53-4&quot;&gt;Schatzkin, Paul (2002), ''The Boy Who Invented Television''. Silver Spring, Maryland: Teamcom Books, pp. 53–54. {{ISBN|1-928791-30-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of a patent interference [[lawsuit|suit]] brought by the [[Radio Corporation of America]] in 1934 and decided in February 1935, his high school chemistry teacher, Justin Tolman, produced a sketch he had made of a blackboard drawing Farnsworth had shown him in spring 1922.  Farnsworth won the suit; RCA appealed the decision in 1936 and lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatzkin111-8&quot;&gt;Schatzkin, Paul (2002), ''The Boy Who Invented Television''. Silver Spring, Maryland: Teamcom Books, pp. 111–18. {{ISBN|1-928791-30-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Farnsworth received royalties from RCA, but he never became wealthy.  The [[video camera tube]] that evolved from the combined work of Farnsworth, Zworykin, and many others was used in all television cameras until the late 20th century, when alternate technologies such as [[charge-coupled device]]s began to appear.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Farnsworth also developed the &quot;image oscillite&quot;, a cathode ray tube that displayed the images captured by the image dissector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatzkin50&quot;&gt;Schatzkin, Paul (2002), ''The Boy Who Invented Television''. Silver Spring, Maryland: Teamcom Books, p. 50. {{ISBN|1-928791-30-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farnsworth called his device an image dissector because it converted individual elements of the image into electricity one at a time.  He replaced the spinning disks with caesium, an element that emits electrons when exposed to light.

In 1984, Farnsworth was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]].

===Fusor===
The [[Fusor|Farnsworth–Hirsch fusor]] is an apparatus designed by Farnsworth to create [[nuclear fusion]]. Unlike most controlled fusion systems, which slowly heat a magnetically confined [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], the fusor injects high-temperature [[ion]]s directly into a reaction chamber, thereby avoiding a considerable amount of complexity.

When the Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor was first introduced to the fusion research world in the late 1960s, the fusor was the first device that could clearly demonstrate it was producing fusion reactions at all.  Hopes at the time were high that it could be quickly developed into a practical power source. However, as with other fusion experiments, development into a power source has proven difficult.  Nevertheless, the fusor has since become a practical [[neutron source]] and is produced commercially for this role.&lt;ref name=&quot;fusor3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fusor2&quot;&gt;

===Other inventions===
At the time he died, Farnsworth held 300 U.S. and foreign [[patents]].  His inventions contributed to the development of [[radar]], [[infra-red]] night vision devices, the [[electron microscope]], the [[Neonatal intensive care unit|baby incubator]], the [[gastroscope]], and the astronomical [[telescope]].&lt;ref name=Utah-bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/farnsworth.cfm &quot;Philo T.

==TV appearance==
Although he was the man responsible for its technology, Farnsworth appeared only once on a television program. On July 3, 1957, he was a mystery guest (&quot;Doctor X&quot;) on the CBS quiz show ''[[I've Got A Secret]]''. He fielded questions from the panel as they unsuccessfully tried to guess his secret (&quot;I invented electronic television.&quot;). For stumping the panel, he received $80 and a carton of Winston cigarettes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatzkin&quot;/&gt; Host [[Garry Moore]] then spent a few minutes discussing with Farnsworth his research on such projects as an early [[analog high-definition television system]], flat-screen receivers, and fusion power.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|pKM4MNrB25o|Philo Farnsworth on I've Got A Secret}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farnsworth said, &quot;There had been attempts to devise a television system using mechanical disks and rotating mirrors and vibrating mirrors—all mechanical. My contribution was to take out the moving parts and make the thing entirely electronic, and that was the concept that I had when I was just a freshman in high school in the Spring of 1921 at age 14.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EFarnsworth37&quot;&gt;Farnsworth, Elma G., p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; When Moore asked about others' contributions, Farnsworth agreed, &quot;There are literally thousands of inventions important to television. I hold something in excess of 165 American patents.&quot; The host then asked about his current research, and the inventor replied, &quot;In television, we're attempting first to make better utilization of the bandwidth, because we think we can eventually get in excess of 2,000 lines instead of 525 ... and do it on an even narrower channel ... which will make for a much sharper picture. We believe in the picture-frame type of a picture, where the visual display will be just a screen. And we hope for a memory, so that the picture will be just as though it's pasted on there.&quot;

A letter to the editor of the ''[[Idaho Falls Post Register]]'' disputed that Farnsworth had made only one television appearance. Roy Southwick claimed &quot;... I interviewed Mr. [Philo] Farnsworth back in 1953—the first day [[KIDK-TV|KID-TV]] went on the air.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Idaho Falls ''Post Register'', December 10, 2007, p. A4 (digital version requires subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; KID-TV, which later became KIDK-TV, was then located near the Rigby area where Farnsworth grew up.

In a 1996 videotaped interview by the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]], Elma Farnsworth recounts Philo's change of heart about the value of television, after seeing how it showed man walking on the moon, in real time, to millions of viewers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/elma-pem-farnsworth# | publisher=(Part 10 of 12) [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] | title= Elma &quot;Pen&quot; Farnsworth | date= June 25, 1996|accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

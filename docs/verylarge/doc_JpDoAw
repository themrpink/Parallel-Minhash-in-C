A star with a streaming tail, probably [[Halley's Comet]], then appears.&lt;ref group=note&gt;A comet was believed to be a bad omen at this time and Halley's comet would have first appeared in 1066 around 24 April, nearly four months after Harold's coronation.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the lower border of the tapestry shows a fleet of ghost-like ships thus hinting at a future invasion.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#33|(scene 33)]]&lt;/sup&gt; The news of Harold's coronation is taken to Normandy, whereupon we are told that William is ordering a fleet of ships to be built although it is Bishop Odo shown issuing the instructions.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#35|(scene 35)]]&lt;/sup&gt; The invaders reach England, and land unopposed. William orders his men to find food, and a meal is cooked.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#43|(scene 43)]]&lt;/sup&gt; A house is burnt by two soldiers, which may indicate some ravaging of the local countryside on the part of the invaders, and underneath, on a smaller scale than the arsonists, a woman holds her boy's hand as she asks for humanity.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#47|(scene 47)]]&lt;/sup&gt; News is brought to William.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Possibly about Harold's victory in the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], although the Tapestry does not specify this.&lt;/ref&gt; The Normans build a [[motte and bailey]] at Hastings to defend their position. Messengers are sent between the two armies, and William makes a speech to prepare his army for battle.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#51|(scene 51)]]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[File:Normans Bayeux.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Hastings]]]]
The [[Battle of Hastings]] was fought on 14 October 1066 less than three weeks after the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] but the tapestry does not provide this context. The English fight on foot behind a [[shield wall]], whilst the Normans are on horses.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This reflected the military reality.&lt;/ref&gt; Two fallen knights are named as [[Leofwine Godwinson|Leofwine]] and [[Gyrth Godwinson|Gyrth]], Harold's brothers, but both armies are shown fighting bravely.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt; Bishop Odo brandishes his baton or mace and rallies the Norman troops in battle.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#54|(scene 54)]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Clerics were not supposed to shed blood, hence Odo has no sword. Rather than just praying for the Norman knights, however, which ought to have been his role, Odo seems militarily active.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt; To reassure his knights that he is still alive and well, William raises his helmet to show his face.&lt;ref name=musset/&gt; The battle becomes very bloody with troops being slaughtered and dismembered corpses littering the ground. King Harold is killed.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#57|(scene 57)]]&lt;/sup&gt; This scene can be interpreted in different ways, as the name &quot;Harold&quot; appears above a number of knights, making it difficult to identify which character is Harold, since one character appears with an arrow shot in his head under the name &quot;Harold&quot; while another character is slain by a sword underneath the words &quot;he is slain&quot;. The final remaining scene shows unarmoured English troops fleeing the battlefield. The last part of the tapestry is missing; however, it is thought that the story contained only one additional scene.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

== Latin text ==
{{Main|Bayeux Tapestry tituli}}

''[[Tituli]]'' are included in many scenes to point out names of people and places or to explain briefly the event being depicted.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The text is in Latin but at times the style of words and spelling shows an English influence.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; A dark blue wool, almost black, is mostly used but towards the end of the tapestry other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The complete text and English translation are displayed beside images of each scene at [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli]].

== Recorded history ==
The first reference to the tapestry is from 1476 when it was listed in an inventory of the treasures of Bayeux Cathedral. It survived the sack of Bayeux by the [[Huguenots]] in 1562; and the next certain reference is from 1724.&lt;ref name=musset&gt;{{cite book|last=Musset|first=Lucien|title=The Bayeux Tapestry|year=2005|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=1-84383-163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine Lancelot sent a report to the ''Académie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres'' concerning a sketch he had received about a work concerning William the Conqueror. He had no idea where or what the original was, although he suggested it could have been a tapestry.&lt;ref name=stenton&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertrand|first=Simone|title=The Bayeux Tapestry|year=1965|publisher=Phaedon Press|chapter=The History of the Tapestry|editor=Frank Stenton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite further enquiries he discovered no more.

[[File:MontfauconHaroldEye.jpg|thumb|[[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon]] / Benoît drawing showing Harold's death]]

The Benedictine scholar [[Bernard de Montfaucon]] made more successful investigations and found that the sketch was of a small portion of a tapestry preserved at Bayeux Cathedral. In 1729 and 1730 he published drawings and a detailed description of the complete work in the first two volumes of his ''Les Monuments de la Monarchie française''. The drawings were by [[Antoine Benoît]], one of the ablest draughtsmen of that time.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt;

The tapestry was first briefly noted in English in 1743 by [[William Stukeley]], in his ''Palaeographia Britannica''.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1988, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The first detailed account in English was written by [[Smart Lethieullier]], who was living in Paris in 1732–3, and was acquainted with Lancelot and de Montfaucon: it was not published, however, until 1767, as an appendix to [[Andrew Ducarel]]'s ''Anglo-Norman Antiquities''.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1988, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], in 1792, the tapestry was confiscated as public property to be used for covering military wagons.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; It was rescued from a wagon by a local lawyer who stored it in his house until the troubles were over, whereupon he sent it to the city administrators for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; After [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]] the Fine Arts Commission, set up to safeguard national treasures in 1803, required it to be removed to Paris for display at the [[Musée Napoléon]].&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; When [[Napoleon]] abandoned his planned invasion of Britain the tapestry's propaganda value was lost and it was returned to Bayeux where the council displayed it on a winding apparatus of two cylinders.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; Despite scholars' concern that the tapestry was becoming damaged the council refused to return it to the cathedral.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt;

[[File:Stothard Bayeux 41 42 Plate 10.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Alfred Stothard|Stothard]] / [[James Basire|Basire]] engravings: scenes showing the Norman troops crossing the Channel and landing in Sussex]]
In 1816 the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] commissioned its historical draughtsman, [[Charles Alfred Stothard|Charles Stothard]], to visit Bayeux to make an accurate hand-coloured [[facsimile]] of the tapestry. His drawings were subsequently engraved by [[James Basire]] jr. and published by the Society in 1819–23.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1988, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Stothard's images are still of value as a record of the tapestry as it was before 19th-century restoration.

By 1842 the tapestry was displayed in a special-purpose room in the Bibliothèque Publique. It required special storage in 1870 with the threatened invasion of Normandy in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and again in 1939–1944 by the [[Ahnenerbe]] during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]] and the [[Normandy landings]]. On 27 June 1944 the [[Gestapo]] took the tapestry to the [[Louvre]] and on 18 August, three days before the [[Wehrmacht]] withdrew from Paris, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] sent a message (intercepted by [[Government Code and Cypher School|Bletchley Park]]) ordering it to be taken to &quot;a place of safety&quot;, thought to be Berlin.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; It was only on 22 August that the [[SS]] attempted to take possession of the tapestry, by which time the Louvre was again in French hands.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; After the [[liberation of Paris]], on 25 August, the tapestry was again put on public display in the Louvre, and in 1945 it was returned to Bayeux,&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; where it is exhibited at the Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux.

== Later reputation and history==
The inventory listing of 1476 shows that the tapestry was being hung annually in Bayeux Cathedral for the week of the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist|Feast of St John the Baptist]]; and this was still the case in 1728, although by that time the purpose was merely to air the hanging, which was otherwise stored in a chest.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; Clearly, the work was being well cared for. In the eighteenth century, the artistry was regarded as crude or even barbarous—red and yellow multi-coloured horses upset some critics. It was thought to be unfinished because the linen was not covered with embroidery.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; However, its exhibition in the Louvre in 1797 caused a sensation, with ''[[Le Moniteur Universel|Le Moniteur]]'', which normally dealt with foreign affairs, reporting on it on its first two pages.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; It inspired a popular musical, ''La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde''. It was because the tapestry was regarded as an antiquity rather than a work of art that in 1804 it was returned to Bayeux, wherein 1823 one commentator, A. L. Léchaudé d'Anisy, reported that &quot;there is a sort of purity in its primitive forms, especially considering the state of the arts in the eleventh century&quot;.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt;

The tapestry was becoming a tourist attraction, with [[Robert Southey]] complaining of the need to queue to see the work. In the 1843 ''Hand-book for Travellers in France'' by [[John Murray III]], a visit was included on &quot;Recommended Route 26 (Caen to Cherbourg via Bayeux)&quot;, and this guidebook led [[John Ruskin]] to go there; he would describe the tapestry as &quot;the most interesting thing in its way conceivable&quot;. [[Charles Dickens]], however, was not impressed: &quot;It is certainly the work of amateurs; very feeble amateurs at the beginning and very heedless some of them too.&quot;&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt;

During the Second World War [[Heinrich Himmler]] coveted the work, regarding it as &quot;important for our glorious and cultured Germanic history&quot;.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt;

In 2018, [[President of France|French President]] [[Emmanuel Macron]] announced that the Bayeux Tapestry would be loaned to Britain for public display. It is expected to be exhibited at the [[British Museum]] in London, but not before 2020. It will be the first time that it has left France in 950 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/britain-to-get-bayeux-tapestry-as-macron-agrees-loan-n5brflnjx|title=Bayeux Tapestry to be displayed in Britain|website=The Times|date=17 January 2018|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mysteries ==
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene57 Harold death.jpg|thumb|Harold's death. Legend above: ''Harold rex interfectus est'', &quot;King Harold is killed&quot;]]
[[File:Harold arrow, Bayeux tapestry detail.jpeg|thumb|right|Detail of arrow]]
[[File:Aelfgyva.jpg|thumb|''Ubi unus clericus et Ælfgyva'']]

The depiction of events on the tapestry raises several mysteries:
* The identification of [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II of England]] in the vignette depicting his death is disputed. Some recent historians disagree with the traditional view that Harold is the figure struck in the eye with an arrow. The view that it is Harold is supported by the fact that the words ''Harold Rex'' (King Harold) appear right above the figure's head. However, the arrow is a later addition following a period of repair,&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; as can be seen by comparison with [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s engravings of the tapestry as it was in 1729, in which the arrow is absent (see illustration above). However, needle holes in the linen do suggest that something had originally been in the place of the arrow, though it may have been a lance rather than an arrow.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; A figure is slain with a sword in the subsequent plate, and the phrase above the figure refers to Harold's death (''interfectus est'', &quot;he is slain&quot;). This would appear to be more consistent with the labeling used elsewhere in the work. It was common medieval [[iconography]] that a [[perjurer]] was to die with a weapon through the eye. Therefore, the tapestry might be said to emphasize William's rightful claim to the throne by depicting Harold as an oath breaker. Whether he actually died in this way remains a mystery and is much debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foys|first=Martin|title=Pulling the Arrow Out: The Legend of Harold's Death and the Bayeux Tapestry|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Woodbridge, UK|year=2009|pages=158–75|isbn=978-1-84383-470-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a panel with what appears to be a [[clergy]]man touching or possibly striking a woman's face. No one knows the significance of this scene or the caption above it: ''ubi unus clericus et Ælfgyva'' (&quot;where [or ''in which''] a certain cleric and Ælfgyva&quot;), where Ælfgyva is the Latinised spelling of [[Ælfgifu]], a popular Anglo-Saxon woman's name (literally &quot;elf-gift&quot;).&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; The use of the [[grapheme]] [[Æ]] shows familiarity with English spelling.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; There are two naked male figures in the border below this figure; the one directly below the figure is in a pose mirroring that of the cleric, squatting and displaying his [[genitalia]] (a scene that was frequently censored in historical reproductions). However, similar naked figures appear elsewhere in the lower border where there seems to be no connection at all with the main action.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; Harold had a younger sister named Ælfgifu (her name is spelt Alveva in the [[Domesday book]]) who was possibly promised to William by Harold or even betrothed to him, but she died c. 1066, prior to the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mason |first=Emma |title=The House of Godwine: the history of a dynasty |place=London |publisher=Hambledon and London |year=2004 |isbn=1852853891 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ælfgifu of Northampton|Ælfgifu]] was also the name of the mother of [[Sweyn Knutsson]] and [[Harold Harefoot]], past kings of Denmark and England respectively, via [[Cnut the Great]]. It has been speculated that this scene, occurring after the meeting of Harold and William, is to remind the contemporary viewers of a scandal that occurred between Ælfgifu of Northampton and [[Emma of Normandy]], another of Cnut's wives, that eventually led to the crowning of Edward the Confessor, child of Cnut and Emma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bridgeford&quot; /&gt; 
* At least two panels of the tapestry are missing, perhaps even another {{convert|6.4|m|yd|abbr=on}} in total. This missing area may have included William's coronation.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

== Reliability ==
The Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by the [[House of Normandy]] and essentially depicts a Norman viewpoint. However, Harold is shown as brave, and his soldiers are not belittled. Throughout, William is described as ''dux'' (&quot;duke&quot;), whereas Harold, also called ''dux'' up to his coronation, is subsequently called ''rex'' (&quot;king&quot;).&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; The fact that the narrative extensively covers Harold's activities in Normandy (in 1064) indicates that the intention was to show a strong relationship between that expedition and the Norman Conquest starting two years later. It is for this reason that the tapestry is generally seen by modern scholars as an [[apologia]] for the Norman Conquest.

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene29-30-31 Harold coronation.jpg|thumb|[[Coronation]] of Harold]]
The tapestry's narration seems to place stress on Harold's oath to William, although its rationale is not made clear.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; Norman sources claim that the English succession was being pledged to William, but English sources give varied accounts.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; Today it is thought that the Norman sources are to be preferred.&lt;ref name=bates&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Bates, David | publisher = Oxford University Press | encyclopedia= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | title= William I  | year = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29448?docPos=2 |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/29448 }} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the tapestry and Norman sources&lt;ref name=poitiers&gt;William of Poitiers: ''Gesta Willelmi ducis Normannorum et regis Anglorum'', c.1071.

Contemporary scholarship has not decided the matter, although it is generally thought that Ealdred performed the coronation.&lt;ref name=gibbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbs-Smith|first=Charles|title=The Bayeux Tapestry|year=1965|publisher=Phaedon Press|chapter=Notes on the Plates|editor=Frank Stenton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cowdrey&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Cowdrey, H.

Although political propaganda or personal emphasis may have somewhat distorted the historical accuracy of the story, the Bayeux Tapestry constitutes a visual record of medieval arms, apparel, and other objects unlike any other artifact surviving from this period. There is no attempt at continuity between scenes, either in individuals' appearance or clothing. The knights carry shields, but show no system of hereditary [[coats of arms]]—the beginnings of modern heraldic structure were in place, but would not become standard until the middle of the 12th century.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; It has been noted that the warriors are depicted fighting with bare hands, while other sources indicate the general use of gloves in battle and hunt.

American historian [[Stephen D. White]], in a study of the tapestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acls.org/research/fellow.aspx?cid=026DBD01-5050-DE11-97CE-000C293A51F7|title=ACLS American Council of Learned Societies - www.acls.org - Results|website=www.acls.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; has &quot;cautioned against reading it as an English or Norman story, showing how the animal fables visible in the borders may instead offer a commentary on the dangers of conflict and the futility of pursuing power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weeklystandard.com/micah-mattix/prufrock-the-meaning-of-the-bayeux-tapestry-when-israeli-prisoners-translated-the-hobbit-and-the-french-anti-keynes|title=Prufrock: The Meaning of the Bayeux Tapestry, When Israeli Prisoners Translated 'The Hobbit,' and the French 'Anti-Keynes'|date=25 January 2018|website=The Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic context ==
Tapestry fragments have been found in Scandinavia dating from the ninth century and it is thought that Norman and Anglo-Saxon embroidery developed from this sort of work. Examples are to be found in the [[Oseberg ship#Grave goods|grave goods of the Oseberg ship]] and the [[Överhogdal tapestries]].&lt;ref name=musset/&gt;

A monastic text from [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], the ''[[Liber Eliensis]]'', mentions a woven narrative wall-hanging commemorating the deeds of [[Byrhtnoth]], killed in 991. Wall-hangings were common by the tenth century with English and Norman texts particularly commending the skill of Anglo-Saxon seamstresses. Mural paintings imitating draperies still exist in France and Italy and there are twelfth-century mentions of other wall-hangings in Normandy and France. A poem by [[Baldric of Dol]] might even describe the Bayeux Tapestry itself.&lt;ref name=musset/&gt; The Bayeux Tapestry was therefore not unique at the time it was created: rather it is remarkable for being the sole surviving example of medieval narrative needlework.&lt;ref name=digby&gt;{{cite book |last=Wingfield Digby|first=George |title=The Bayeux Tapestry |year=1965 |edition=2nd |publisher=Phaidon Press|chapter=Technique and Production|editor-first=Frank |editor-last=Stenton |editor-link=Frank Stenton |pages=37–55 (37, 45–48) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the embroidery artist Jan Messent completed a reconstruction showing William accepting the surrender of English nobles at [[Berkhamsted]] (''Beorcham''), Hertfordshire, and his coronation.&lt;ref name=berko-history&gt;{{cite web|title=Berkhamsted Castle|url= http://www.rollitt.co.uk/Local-History.html |work=Berkhamsted Local History Society|access-date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berko-castle&gt;{{cite web |title=Invasion of England, Submission to William |url=http://www.berkhamsted-castle.org.uk/BOARDS1.pdf |work=Castle Panels |publisher=Berkhamsted Castle |access-date=9 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708071619/http://www.berkhamsted-castle.org.uk/BOARDS1.pdf |archive-date=8 July 2011 |df=dmy }} (discussed in {{cite web |url=http://www.berkhamsted-castle.org.uk/Panels.htm |title=Castle Panels |year=2014 |access-date=11 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219073331/http://www.berkhamsted-castle.org.uk/Panels.htm |archive-date=19 February 2014 |df=dmy }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Messant|first=Jan|title=Bayeux Tapestry Embroiderers' Story|publisher=Madeira Threads (UK) Ltd|location=Thirsk, UK|year=1999|page=112|isbn=978-0-9516348-5-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013, 416 residents of [[Alderney]] in the [[Channel Islands]] finished a continuation including William's coronation and the building of the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref name=bbc-alderney&gt;{{cite news|title=Bayeux Tapestry ending made in Alderney|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-21390820 |newspaper=BBC News|date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
[[Image:Street art in Bayeux about tapestry.jpg|upright|thumb|Street art in Bayeux referring to the Tapestry]]
Because it resembles a modern [[comic strip]] or movie [[storyboard]], is widely recognised, and is so distinctive in its artistic style, the Bayeux Tapestry has frequently been used or reimagined in a variety of different popular culture contexts. George Wingfield Digby wrote in 1957:
{{quote|It was designed to tell a story to a largely illiterate public; it is like a strip cartoon, racy, emphatic, colourful, with a good deal of blood and thunder and some ribaldry.&lt;ref&gt;Wingfield Digby, &quot;Technique and Production&quot;, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been cited by [[Scott McCloud]] in ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' as an example of early [[Sequential art|sequential-narrative art]];&lt;ref&gt;McCloud 1993. ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' pp. 11–14&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bryan Talbot]], a British comic book artist, has called it &quot;the first known [[History of the British comic|British comic strip]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The History of the British Comic, [[Bryan Talbot]], ''[[The Guardian]] Guide'', 8 September 2007, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has inspired many modern [[Editorial cartoon|political]] and other [[cartoon]]s, including:
* [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]]'s satirical pastiche ''Ye Berlyn Tapestrie'', published in 1915, which tells the story of the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Hassall |author-link=John Hassall (illustrator) |title=Ye Berlyn Tapestrie |orig-year=1915 |year=2014 |place=Oxford |publisher=Bodleian Library |isbn=978-1-85124-416-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rea Irvin]]'s cover for the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine of 15 July 1944 marking [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1944-07-15#folio=CV1 |title=The New Yorker |publisher=Condé Nast |date=15 July 1944 | access-date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Gale (cartoonist)|George Gale]]'s pastiche chronicling the saga leading up to Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]], published across six pages in ''[[The Times]]''{{'s}} &quot;Europa&quot; supplement on 1 January 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/george_gale_1_665795 |first=Alasdair |last=Steven |title=George Gale: Obituary |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=24 September 2003 |access-date=3 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tapestry has inspired modern embroideries, most notably and directly:
* The [[Overlord Embroidery]] (1974), commemorating [[Operation Overlord]] and the [[D-Day|Normandy landings]] of 1944, now at [[Portsmouth]]
* The [[Prestonpans Tapestry]] (2010), which chronicles the events surrounding the [[Battle of Prestonpans]] in 1745

Other embroideries more loosely inspired by it include the [[Hastings Embroidery]] (1966), the [[New World Tapestry]] (1980–2000), the [[Quaker Tapestry]] (1981–89), the [[Great Tapestry of Scotland]] (2013), the [[Scottish Diaspora Tapestry]] (2014–15), ''[[Magna Carta (An Embroidery)]]'' (2014–15), and (in this case a true woven tapestry) the [[Game of Thrones Tapestry]] (2017).

A number of films have used sections of the tapestry in their opening credits or closing titles, including [[Disney]]'s ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', Anthony Mann's ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'', Franco Zeffirelli's ''[[Hamlet]]'', Frank Cassenti's ''[[La Chanson de Roland]]'', Kevin Reynolds' ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'', and Richard Fleischer's ''[[The Vikings (film)|The Vikings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Re-embroidering the Bayeux Tapestry in Film and Media: The Flip Side of History in Opening and End Title Sequences | publisher = Richard Burt, University of Florida | date = 18 August 2007 | url = http://www.clas.ufl.edu/~rburt/middleagesonfilm/bayeux1.html | access-date = 31 August 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908114843/http://www.english.ufl.edu/exemplaria/movie/RBBT.pdf | archive-date=8 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design and embroidery of the tapestry form one of the narrative strands of [[Marta Morazzoni]]'s 1988 novella ''The Invention of Truth''.

The tapestry is referred to in [[Tony Kushner]]'s play ''[[Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes|Angels in America]]''. The apocryphal account of Queen Matilda's creation of the tapestry is used, perhaps in order to demonstrate that Louis, one of the main characters, holds himself to mythological standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;sparknote_angels&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/angels/section3.rhtml | title=SparkNote on Angels in America | publisher=SparkNotes LLC | work=SparkNotes.com | access-date=30 October 2014 | author=SparkNotes Editors | quote=Louis's problem is exacerbated by his tendency towards abstraction and his unreasonably high standards for himself. In Scene Three, he tells Emily about La Reine Mathilde, who supposedly created the Bayeux Tapestry. Louis describes La Reine's unceasing devotion to William the Conqueror and laments his own comparative lack of devotion. But as critic Allen J. Frantzen has pointed out, this popular story about Mathilde and the tapestry is wrong—it was actually created in England decades after the conquest. Louis, then, is holding himself to a mythological standard of loyalty, and he curses himself based on a positively unreal example. This is part of a larger pattern of excessive guilt and harshness toward himself, which, paradoxically, prevents him from judging his own weaknesses accurately and trying to correct them. Because no one could possibly live up to Mathilde's example, Louis initially justifies his moral failure. Later, in Perestroika, he will arrive at a more genuine remorse and an honest understanding of what he has done.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seth''',{{efn|({{hebrew Name|{{Hebrew|שֵׁת}}|Šēt|Šēṯ}}; {{lang-ar|شِيْث|translit=Šīṯ}}; {{lang-el|Σήθ}} ''Sḗth''; {{IPA-ar|ˈʃiːθ|IPA}}; &quot;placed&quot;, &quot;appointed&quot;)}} in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Sethianism]], and [[Islam]], was the third son of [[Adam and Eve]] and brother of [[Cain and Abel]], their only other children mentioned by name in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. According to {{bibleverse||Genesis|4:25|HE}}, Seth was born after Abel's murder by Cain, and Eve believed that [[God]] had appointed him as a replacement for Abel.

==Genesis==
According to the [[Book of Genesis]], Seth was born when Adam was 130 years old (according to the [[Masoretic Text]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;ch53&quot;&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|5:3|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 230 years old (according to the [[Septuagint]]),&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Gerhard, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3261014 “The Chronology of the Pentateuch: A Comparison of the MT and LXX”], ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', vol. 102, no. 3, 1983, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;a son in his likeness and image&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch53&quot; /&gt; The genealogy is repeated at {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|1:1–3|HE}}. {{bibleverse||Genesis|5:4–5|HE}} states that Adam fathered &quot;sons and daughters&quot; before his death, aged 930 years. According to Genesis, Seth lived to the age of 912.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|5:8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;   (2962 BC)

==Family tree==
&lt;center&gt;
{{AdamtoNoah}}
&lt;/center&gt;

==Jewish tradition==
Seth figures in the [[pseudepigraphical]] texts of the ''[[Life of Adam and Eve]]'' (the ''Apocalypse of Moses''). It recounts the lives of Adam and Eve from after their expulsion from the [[Garden of Eden]] to their deaths. While the surviving versions were composed from the early 3rd to the 5th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=M.D. |last=Johnson |chapter=Life of Adam and Eve, a new translation and introduction |editor1-first=J.H. |editor1-last=Charlesworth |title=the Old Testament Pseudepigrapha |volume= 2 |isbn=0-385-18813-7 |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|252}} the literary units in the work are considered to be older and predominantly of [[Jew]]ish origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;sparks&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=H.F.D. |last=Sparks |title=The Apocryphal Old Testament |isbn=0-19-826177-2 |year=1984 |page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is wide agreement that the original was composed in a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|251}} in the 1st century AD/CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|252}}  In the Greek versions, Seth and Eve travel to the doors of the Garden to beg for some oil of the Tree of Mercy (i.e. the [[Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of Life]]). On the way, Seth is attacked and bitten by a wild beast, which goes away when ordered by Seth. [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] refuses to give them the oil at that time, but promises to give it at the [[end time|end of time]], when all flesh will be raised up, the delights of paradise will be given to the holy people and God will be in their midst. On their return, Adam says to Eve: &quot;What hast thou done? Thou hast brought upon us great wrath which is death.&quot; (chapters 5–14) Later, only Seth can witness the taking-up of Adam at his funeral in a divine chariot, which deposits him in the Garden of Eden. [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi) refers to Seth as the ancestor of [[Noah]] and hence the father of all mankind, all other humans having perished in the [[Great Flood]]. Seth is seen by Eve as a replacement given by God for Abel, whom Cain had slain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=King James Bible|pages=Genesis, 4:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that late in life, Adam gave Seth secret teachings that would become the [[Kabbalah]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The [[Zohar]] refers to Seth as &quot;ancestor of all the generations of the tzaddikim&quot; (Hebrew: [[tzaddikim|righteous ones]]).&lt;ref&gt;Zohar 1:36b&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Seder Olam Rabbah]], based on Jewish reckoning, he was born in 130 [[Anno Mundi|AM]]. According to [[Aggadah]], he had 33 sons and 23 daughters. According to the Seder Olam Rabbah, he died in 1042 AM.

==Josephus==
In the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', [[Josephus]] refers to Seth as virtuous and of excellent character,&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus, [https://www.crcnh.org/downloads/history-reference/josephus/The-Antiquities-of-The-Jews.pdf ''Antiquities of the Jews''], chapter 2, section 3, accessed 2 September 2020&lt;/ref&gt; and reports that his descendants invented the wisdom of the heavenly bodies, and built the &quot;pillars of the sons of Seth&quot;, two pillars inscribed with many scientific discoveries and inventions, notably in [[astronomy]]. They were built by Seth's descendants based on [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]'s prediction that the world would be destroyed at one time by fire and another time by [[deluge (mythology)|global flood]], in order to protect the discoveries and be remembered after the destruction. One was composed of brick, and the other of stone, so that if the pillar of brick should be destroyed, the pillar of stone would remain, both reporting the ancient discoveries, and informing men that a pillar of brick was also erected. Josephus reports that the pillar of stone remained in the land of Siriad in his day.

One of the conclusions of the [[Yalta Conference]] was that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] would return all [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens that found themselves in the Allied zone to the Soviet Union ([[Operation Keelhaul]]). That immediately affected the [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet prisoners of war]] liberated by the Allies, but was also extended to all Eastern European [[refugees]]. Outlining the plan to force refugees to return to the [[Soviet Union]], the codicil was kept secret from the American and British people for over 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Hornberger ''Repatriation — The Dark Side of World War II''.

==In the Americas==
===Inca Empire===

{{main|Mitma}}

The [[Inca Empire]] dispersed conquered ethnic groups throughout the empire to break down traditional community ties and force the heterogeneous population to adopt the [[Quechua language]] and culture. Never fully successful in the [[pre-Columbian]] era, the [[totalitarian]] policies had their greatest success when they were adopted, from the 16th century, to create a pan-Andean identity defined against [[Spain|Spanish]] rule. Much of the current knowledge of Inca population transfers comes from their description by the Spanish chroniclers [[Pedro Cieza de León]] and [[Bernabé Cobo]].

===Canada===
{{main|Expulsion of the Acadians}}
During the [[French and Indian War]] (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War between Great Britain and France), the British forcibly relocated approximately 8,000 [[Acadians]] from the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Maritime Provinces]], first to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and then to France. Thousands died of drowning, starvation, or illness as a result of the deportation. Some of the Acadians who had been relocated to France then emigrated to  [[Louisiana]], where their descendants became known as [[Cajuns]].

The [[High Arctic relocation]] took place during the Cold War in the 1950s, when 87 Inuit were moved by the Government of Canada to the [[High Arctic]]. The relocation has been a source of controversy: described as either a humanitarian gesture to save the lives of starving native people or a forced migration instigated by the federal government to assert its sovereignty in the [[Northern Canada#Sub-divisions|Far North]] against the Soviet Union. Both sides acknowledge that the relocated Inuit were not given sufficient support.

Numerous other [[indigenous peoples of Canada]] have been forced to relocate their communities to different reserve lands, including the [['Nak'waxda'xw]] in 1964.

====Japanese Canadian internment====
{{main|Japanese Canadian internment}}
Japanese Canadian Internment refers to the detainment of Japanese Canadians following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the Canadian declaration of war on Japan during World War II. The forced relocation subjected Japanese Canadians to government-enforced curfews and interrogations and job and property losses. The internment of Japanese Canadians was ordered by Prime Minister [[Mackenzie King]], largely because of existing racism. However, evidence supplied by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] show that the decision was unwarranted.

Until 1949, four years after World War II had ended, all persons of Japanese heritage were systematically removed from their homes and businesses and sent to internment camps. The Canadian government shut down all Japanese-language newspapers, took possession of businesses and fishing boats, and effectively sold them. To fund the internment itself, vehicles, houses, and personal belongings were also sold.

===United States===
====Independence====
During and after the [[American Revolutionary War]], many [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalists]] were deprived of life, liberty or property or suffered lesser physical harm, sometimes under [[Act of Attainder#American usage|acts of attainder]] and sometimes by main force. [[Parker Wickham]] and other Loyalists developed a well-founded fear. As a result, many chose or were forced to leave their former homes in what became the United States, often going to [[Canada]], where the Crown promised them land in an effort at compensation and resettlement. Most were given land on the frontier in what became Upper Canada and had to create new towns. The communities were largely settled by people of the same ethnic ancestry and religious faith. In some cases, towns were started by men of particular military units and their families.

====Native American relocations====
In the 19th century, the [[United States]] government removed a number of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] to federally-owned and -designated [[Indian reservation]]s. Native Americans were removed from the Northern to the Western States. The most well-known removals were those of the 1830s from the Southeast, starting with the [[Choctaw]] people. Under the 1830 [[Indian Removal Act]], the Five Civilized Tribes were relocated from their place, east of the [[Mississippi River]], to the [[Indian Territory]] in the west. The process resulted in great social dislocation for all, numerous deaths, and the &quot;[[Trail of Tears]]&quot; for the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]]. Resistance to Indian removal led to several violent conflicts, including the [[Second Seminole War]] in [[Florida]].

In August 1863 all [[Maidu|Konkow Maidu]] were to be sent to the Bidwell Ranch in Chico and then be taken to the [[Round Valley Indian Tribes of the Round Valley Reservation|Round Valley Reservation]] at Covelo in Mendocino County. Any Indians remaining in the area were to be shot. Maidu were rounded up and marched under guard west out of the Sacramento Valley and through to the Coastal Range. 461 Native Americans started the trek, 277 finished.&lt;ref&gt;Dizard, Jesse A.

(Part of [[California Genocide]])

The [[Long Walk of the Navajo]] refers to the 1864 relocation of the [[Navajo]] people by the US government in a forced walk from their land in what is now [[Arizona]] to eastern [[New Mexico]]. The [[Yavapai]] people were forcibly marched from [[Yavapai-Apache Nation|Camp Verde Reservation]] to [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation]], Arizona, on February 27, 1875, following the [[Yavapai War]]. The federal government restricted [[Plains Indians]] to reservations following several [[Indian Wars]] in which Indians and [[European Americans]] fought over lands and resources. Indian prisoners of war were held at [[Fort Marion]] and [[Fort Pickens]] in [[Florida]].

After the [[Yavapai Wars]] 375 [[Yavapai]] perished in [[Indian Removal]] deportations out of 1,400 remaining Yavapai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Nicholas |title=Sedona, Sacred Earth: A Guide to the Red Rock County|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZkbfroP9P8C&amp;pg=PT20|year=2005|publisher=Light Technology Publishing|isbn=978-1-62233-652-4|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====General Order No. 11 (1863)====
General Order No. 11 is the title of a Union Army decree issued during the [[American Civil War]] on 25 August 1863, forcing the evacuation of rural areas in four counties in western Missouri. That followed extensive insurgency and guerrilla warfare. The Army cleared the area to deprive the guerrillas of local support. Union General [[Thomas Ewing Jr.|Thomas Ewing]] issued the order, which affected all rural residents regardless of their loyalty. Those who could prove their loyalty to the Union were permitted to stay in the region but had to leave their farms and move to communities near military outposts. Those who could not do so had to vacate the area altogether.

In the process, Union forces caused considerable property destruction and deaths because of conflicts.

====Japanese American internment====
{{main|Japanese American internment}}

In the wake of Imperial Japan's attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] and with decades-long suspicions and antagonism to ethnic Japanese mounting, the US government ordered military forcible relocation and internment of approximately 110,000 [[Japanese Americans]] and Japanese residing in the United States to newly created &quot;War Relocation Camps,&quot; or internment camps, in 1942 for of the war. European Americans often bought their property at losses.

Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans residing on the [[West Coast of the United States]] were all interned. In [[Hawaii]], where more than 150,000 Japanese Americans composed nearly a third of that territory's population, officials interned only 1,200 to 1,800 Japanese Americans. In the late 20th century, the US government paid some compensation to survivors of the internment camps.

==In Asia==
===Ottoman Empire===
The early [[Ottoman Empire]] used forced population transfers to change the ethnic and economic landscape of its territories. The term used in Ottoman documents is ''sürgün'', from ''sürmek'' (to displace).

Ottoman population transfers until the reign of [[Mehmet I]] (d. 1421) shuttled tribal Turkmen and Tatar groups from the state's Asiatic territories to the Balkans (Rumeli). Many of the groups were supported as paramilitary forces along the frontier with [[Christian Europe]]. Simultaneously, Christian communities were transported from newly conquered lands in the Balkans into Thrace and Anatolia. While the general flows back and forth across the Dardanelles continued, [[Murad II]] (d. 1451) and [[Mehmet II]] (d. 1481) concentrated on the demographic reorganization of their empire's urban centres. Murad II's conquest of Salonika was followed by its state-enforced settlement of Muslims to [[Giannitsa|Yenice Vardar]] from Anatolia. Mehmet II's transfers focused on the repopulation of [[Constantinople]], following its conquest in 1453, transporting Christians, Muslims, and Jews into the new capital from across the empire. The huge [[Belgrade Forest]] north of Istanbul and named after re-settled people from [[Belgrade]] is a reminder of those times. Also, the Belgrade Gate is on the east side of the city, on the way to [[Serbia]].

From [[Bayezid II]] (d. 1512), the empire had difficulty with the heterodox ''[[Qizilbash]]'' (''kizilbas'') movement in eastern Anatolia. Forced relocation of the Qizilbash continued until at least the end of the 16th century. [[Selim I]] (d. 1520) ordered merchants, artisans, and scholars transported to Constantinople from [[Tabriz]] and [[Cairo]]. The state mandated Muslim immigration to [[Rhodes]] and [[Cyprus]] after their conquests in 1522 and 1571 respectively and resettled [[Greek Cypriots]] onto [[Anatolia]]'s coast.

Knowledge among western historians about the use of ''sürgün'' from the 17th through the 19th century is somewhat unreliable. It appears that the state did not use forced population transfers as much as during its expansionist period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/~phooper/thesis_condensed.pdf P. Hooper, Thesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029102418/http://www.unm.edu/~phooper/thesis_condensed.pdf |date=2008-10-29 }}, University of New Mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Balkan Wars}}
After the exchanges in the [[Balkans]], the Great Powers and then the [[League of Nations]] used forced population transfer as a mechanism for homogeneity in post-Ottoman [[Balkan states]] to decrease conflict. A Norwegian diplomat, working with the [[League of Nations]] as a [[High Commissioner for Refugees]] in 1919, proposed the idea of a forced population transfer. That was modelled on the earlier Greek-Bulgarian mandatory population transfer of [[Greeks]] in Bulgaria to Greece and of [[Bulgarians]] in Greece to Bulgaria.

In his 2007 book, Israeli scholar Mordechai Zaken discussed the history of the Assyrian Christians of Turkey and Iraq (in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]) since 1842.&lt;ref name=&quot;Survival, Brill 2007&quot;&gt;[[Mordechai Zaken]], ''[[Jewish Subjects and Their Tribal Chieftains in Kurdistan]]: A Study in Survival'', Brill: Leiden and Boston, 2007. Based on his 2004 doctoratw thesis, ''[[Tribal Chieftains and Their Jewish Subjects: A Comparative Study in Survival'']], The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Zaken identified three major eruptions that took place between 1843 and 1933 during which the Assyrian Christians lost their land and hegemony in the Hakkārī (or Julamerk) region in southeastern Turkey and became refugees in other lands, notably Iran and Iraq. They also formed exiled communities in European and western countries (including the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and France, to mention some of the countries). The Assyrian Christians migrated in stages following each political crisis. Millions of Assyrian Christians live today in exiled and prosperous communities in the West.&lt;ref&gt;An early source on the Jews of Kurdistan was Erich Brauer, ''The Jews of Kurdistan,'' 1940, revised edition 1993, edited by Raphael Patai, Wayne State University Press, Detroit&lt;/ref&gt;

Those Arab city dwellers and villagers who took this advice—and there were apparently quite a few villages that entered into &quot;non-aggression&quot; pacts with their Jewish neighbors—were almost always left alone by Jewish forces. Karsh concedes that some Palestinian Arabs were driven out of their homes by Jewish forces with the only large-scale incidents taking place in the towns of Lod and Ramle. However, these expulsions were carried out on grounds of military necessity, were not part of any premeditated &quot;transfer&quot; policy, and involved a relatively small percentage of the total refugee population. These removals, one might add, were directed principally against Palestinian Arabs who had taken an active part in the war and who constituted an immediate threat to nearby Jewish populations or lines of communication. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812211749/http://www.meforum.org/2950/palestine-betrayed |archivedate=2014-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the transfer of Arabs from Palestine had been considered about half a century beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;A Historical Survey of Proposals to Transfer Arabs from Palestine, 1895–1947, Dr. Chaim Simons, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris]], ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–1999'' (New York, 1999), p. 139, &quot;For many Zionists, beginning with Herzl, the only realistic solution lay in transfer. From 1880 to 1920, some entertained the prospect of Jews and Arabs coexisting in peace. But increasingly after 1920, and more emphatically after 1929, for the vast majority a denouement of conflict appeared inescapable. Following the outbreak of 1936, no mainstream leader was able to conceive of future coexistence and peace without a clear physical separation between the two peoples—achievable only by way of transfer and expulsion.”&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Theodor Herzl]] wrote in his diary in 1895 that the [[Zionist]] movement &quot;shall try to spirit the penniless population across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any employment in our country,&quot; but that comment did not specifically relate to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Diaries of Theodor Herzl'', vol. 1 (New York: Herzl Press and Thomas Yoseloff, 1960), pp. 88, 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;That interpretation of Herzl has been disputed. See {{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=Edward |last2=Bogdanor |first2=Paul |title=The Jewish Divide Over Israel |publisher=Transaction |year=2006 |pages=251–2 |quote=[The diary entry] had already been a feature of Palestinian propaganda for decades.... Any discussion of relocation was clearly limited to the specific lands assigned to the Jews, rather than the entire territory. Had Herzl envisaged the mass expulsion of population... there would have been no need to discuss its position in the Jewish entity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years later, one of the recommendations in the Report of the British [[Peel Commission]] in 1937 was for a transfer of Arabs from the area of the proposed Jewish state, and it even included a compulsory transfer from the plains of Palestine. That recommendation was not initially objected to by the British Government.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2003), ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', chapter: The Idea of Transfer in Zionist Thinking&lt;/ref&gt;

The British plan was never endorsed by the Zionists, and transfer was never official Zionist policy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=Edward |last2=Bogdanor |first2=Paul |title=The Jewish Divide Over Israel |publisher=Transaction |year=2006 |pages=254, 258 |quote=There was never any Zionist attempt to inculcate the &quot;transfer&quot; idea in the hearts and minds of Jews.

Of course, the Arabs would not be compelled to do so, it would all be agreed upon in a friendly and amicable spirit.... But the idea of transfer was never official Zionist policy.

Scholars have debated [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s views on transfer, particularly in the context of the [[1937 Ben-Gurion letter]], but according to [[Benny Morris]], Ben-Gurion &quot;elsewhere, in unassailable statements... repeatedly endorsed the idea of “transferring” (or expelling) Arabs, or the Arabs, out of the area of the Jewish state-to-be, either &quot;voluntarily&quot; or by compulsion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Rubin]] and [[Benny Morris]] (2011), [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2011/12/07/ben-gurion-herzl-quotes-morris-rubin/ Quoting Ben Gurion: An Exchange] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020181226/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2011/12/07/ben-gurion-herzl-quotes-morris-rubin/ |date=2014-10-20 }}, [[Commentary (magazine)]], quote: &quot;...the focus by my critics on this quotation was, in any event, nothing more than (an essentially mendacious) red herring – as elsewhere, in unassailable statements, Ben-Gurion at this time repeatedly endorsed the idea of “transferring” (or expelling) Arabs, or the Arabs, out of the area of the Jewish state-to-be, either “voluntarily” or by compulsion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persia===
Removal of populations from along their borders with the [[Ottomans]] in [[Kurdistan]] and the [[Caucasus]] was of strategic importance to the [[Safavids]]. Hundreds of thousands of [[Kurds]], along with large groups of [[Armenians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Azeris]], and [[Turkmens]], were forcibly removed from the border regions and resettled in the interior of [[Persia]]. That was a means of cutting off contact with other members of the groups across the borders as well as limiting passage of peoples. The Khurasani Kurds are a community of nearly 1.7 million people deported from western Kurdistan to North [[Khorasan (Province)|Khorasan]], (northeastern [[Iran]]) by Persia during the 16th to the 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Izady, Mehrdad R., ''The Kurds: A Concise Handbook'', Taylor &amp; Francis, Washington, D.C., 1992&lt;/ref&gt; For a map of these areas see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/commonwealth_islamic_groups.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203133353/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/commonwealth_islamic_groups.jpg |archivedate=2016-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Kurdish tribes were deported farther east, into [[Gharjistan]] in the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of [[Afghanistan]], about 1500 miles away from their former homes in western Kurdistan (''see [[History of the Kurdish people#Displacement of the Kurds|Displacement of the Kurds]]'').

[[File:Deportation of Jews by Assyrians.svg|thumb|right|150px|The Jews were one of the many peoples forcibly mass deported by the Assyrians.]]
In the [[Ancient World]], population transfer was the more humane alternative to putting all the males of a conquered territory to death and enslaving the women and children. From the 13th century BCE, [[Ancient Assyria]] used [[Military history of the Assyrian Empire#Deportations|mass deportation]] as a punishment for [[List of revolutions and rebellions|rebellions]]. By the 9th century, the Assyrians regularly deported thousands of restless subjects to other lands. The Israelite tribes that were forcibly resettled by Assyria later became known as the [[Ten Lost Tribes]]. The [[Hittites]] often transferred populations of defeated peoples back to [[Hattusa|Hatti]]. (Trevor Bryce, ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'') The deportation of the elite of the Jews of Jerusalem on three occasions during the [[Babylonian captivity]] in the 6th century BCE was a population transfer.

===Indian Subcontinent===
When [[British India]] became independent after the Second World War, some of its Muslim inhabitants demanded their own state consisting of two non-contiguous territories: [[East Pakistan]] and [[West Pakistan]]. To facilitate the creation of new states along religious lines (as opposed to racial or linguistic lines as people shared common histories and languages), [[Partition of India#Independence and population exchanges|Population exchanges between India and Pakistan]] were implemented. More than 5 million [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikhs]] were forced to move from present-day Pakistan to present-day India, and the same number of Muslims moved the other way.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} A large number of people, more than a million by some estimates, died in the accompanying violence. Despite the movement of large number of Muslims to Pakistan, an equal number of Muslims chose to stay in India. However, most of the Hindu and Sikh population in Pakistan moved to India in the following years.

In 1992, the ethnic Hindu Kashmiri Pandit population was forcibly moved out of [[Kashmir]] by a minority Urdu-speaking Muslims.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The imposition of [[Urdu]] led to a decline of usage of local languages such as Kashmiri and Dogri. The resultant violence led to the death of many Hindus and the exodus of nearly all Hindus.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

On the [[Indian Ocean]] island of [[Diego Garcia]] between 1967 and 1973, the British government forcibly removed 2000 [[Chagossians|Chagossian]] islanders to make way for a military base. Despite court judgments in their favour, they have not been allowed to return from their exile in [[Mauritius]], but there are signs that financial compensation and an official apology are being considered by the British government.

===Afghanistan===
{{Further|Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan}}
In the 1880s, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] moved the rebellious [[Ghilzai]] [[Pashtuns]] from the southern part of the country to the northern part.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Tomsen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA42 The Wars of Afghanistan: Messianic Terrorism, Tribal Conflicts, and the Failures of Great Powers]'', (Public Affairs: 2011), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Girardet, ''Killing the Cranes,'' London: Chelsea Green&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Abdur Rahman and his successors encouraged Pashtuns, with various incentives, to settle into northern Afghanistan in the late 19th and 20th centuries.

===Cambodia===
One of the [[Khmer Rouge]]'s first acts was to move most of the urban population into the countryside. [[Phnom Penh]], its population of 2.5 million people including as many as 1.5 million wartime refugees living with relatives or in urban area, was soon nearly empty. Similar evacuations occurred at [[Battambang Province|Battambang]], [[Kampong Cham Province|Kampong Cham]], [[Siem Reap Province|Siem Reap]], [[Kampong Thom Province|Kampong Thom]] and throughout the country's other towns and cities. The Khmer Rouge attempted to turn [[Cambodia]] into a classless society by depopulating cities and forcing the urban population (&quot;New People&quot;) into agricultural [[collective farming|communes]]. The entire population was forced to become farmers in [[labor camp]]s.

===Caucasia===
{{See also|Deportation of Azerbaijanis from Armenia}}
In the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] region of the [[former Soviet Union]], ethnic population transfers have affected many thousands of individuals in [[Armenia]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and [[Azerbaijan]] proper; in [[Abkhazia]], [[South Ossetia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] proper and in [[Chechnya]] and adjacent areas within [[Russia]].

===Middle East===
* During the [[Kurdish rebellions]] in Turkey from 1920 and until 1937, hundreds of thousands of [[Kurdish refugees]] were forced to relocate.
* After the creation of the State of Israel and the [[1948 Palestine war|Israel Independence War]], a strong wave of [[anti-Semitism]] in the [[Arab countries]] forced many [[Jews]] to [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|flee]] to Europe, the Americas and Israel. The number estimated is between 850,000 and 1,000,000 people. Those who arrived to Israel were put in a [[refugee camps]] until the state had helped them to recover.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.jimena.org/about-jimena/mission-statement-and-organizational-history/ Jews (JIMENA)|JIMENA's Mission and History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025002533/http://www.jimena.org/about-jimena/mission-statement-and-organizational-history/ |date=2014-10-25 }}&quot;.

{{info|'''This draft is intended to create a primary topic article to replace the current disambiguation page at this title.'''}}
An '''entity''' is something that [[Existence|exists]] as itself, as a subject or as an object, actually or potentially, concretely or abstractly, physically or not. It need not be of material existence. In particular, [[abstraction]]s and [[legal fiction]]s are usually regarded as entities. In general, there is also no presumption that an entity is [[Life|animate]], or [[present]].

The term is broad in scope and may refer to animals; natural features such as mountains; inanimate objects such as tables; numbers or sets as symbols written on a paper; human contrivances such as laws, corporations and academic disciplines; or [[supernatural]] beings such as gods and spirits.

The adjectival form is ''entitative''.

==Etymology==
The word ''entity'' is derived from the Latin ''entitas'', which in turn derives from the Latin ''ens'' meaning &quot;being&quot; or &quot;existing&quot; (compare English ''[[essence]]''). ''Entity'' may hence literally be taken to mean &quot;thing which exists&quot;.

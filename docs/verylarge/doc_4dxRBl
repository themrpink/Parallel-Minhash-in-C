==Symbols==
The Special Olympics [[logo]] is based on the sculpture &quot;Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World&quot; by [[Zurab Tsereteli]] which was a gift to [[The College at Brockport, State University of New York|SUNY Brockport]] when the university hosted the Special Olympics in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brockport.edu/about/archives/special_olympics/gift.html|title=A Special Gift: The College at Brockport|website=www.brockport.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Special Olympics Statue, ca. 1979|last=Unknown|first=College Photographer|date=13 February 2007|hdl = 1951/36531}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo has gone through several changes in its lifetime. The &quot;stick figure&quot; is an abstract but humanistic form designed to convey the impression of movement and activity.  The logo is a symbol of growth, confidence and joy among children and adults with disabilities who are learning coordination, mastering skills, participating in competitions and preparing themselves for richer, more productive lives.

In 2018, the Chicago Park District dedicated the &quot;Eternal Flame of Hope&quot; in honor of the Special Olympics.  The {{convert|30|foot}} sculpture by [[Richard Hunt (sculptor)|Richard Hunt]] stands in a plaza next to Soldier Field, where the first games were held 50 years earlier in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://abc7chicago.com/sports/new-chicago-sculpture-honors-special-olympics-50th-anniversary/3782871/ |title=New Chicago sculpture honors Special Olympics' 50th anniversary |last=Holmes |first=Evelyn |date=2018-07-18 |work=ABC7 Chicago |access-date=2018-07-19 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/Press/2018/Break_Ground_on_Eternal_Flame_of_Hope.aspx |title=To Celebrate the 50th Anniversary Year, Special Olympics and the Chicago Park District Break Ground on Eternal Flame of Hope, a Permanent Monument to Convey the Hope for Inclusion of People with Intellectual Disabilities |date=March 2, 2018 |language=en |access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Flame of Hope (Special Olympics)|Flame of Hope]] is the name given to the torch that is carried to and lit at Special Olympics games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.disabled-world.com/sports/special-olympics/flame-of-hope.php |title=Special Olympics Flame of Hope |date=2017-12-24 |website=Disabled World |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], was originally selected to host the [[2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Special Olympics To Take Place In Sarajevo, Bosnia And Herzegovina|url=http://gamesbids.com/eng/other-news/2009-special-olympics-to-take-place-in-sarajevo-bosnia-and-herzegovina/|website=GamesBid.com|access-date=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to financial problems and the constant delay in reconstruction of the venues of the [[1984 Winter Olympics]], the city gave up hosting the Games, and [[Boise, Idaho]],was invited to host the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Micah|title=Special Olympics come to Idaho in 2009|url=http://arbiteronline.com/2006/06/14/special-olympics-come-to-idaho-in-2009/|access-date=25 July 2015|work=The Arbiter|publisher=The Arbiter|date=June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation==
Special Olympics programs are available for athletes free of charge. More than 5.7 million athletes and Unified Sports partners are involved in Special Olympics sports training and competition in 172 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABILITY Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Cooper|first = Chet|title = Timothy Shriver – Special Olympics|url = http://abilitymagazine.com/Special-Olympics-Shriver.html|publisher = ABILITY Magazine|access-date = 18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization offers year-round training and competition in 32 Olympic-style summer and winter sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2011/07/2011-special-olympics-summer-games/100104/ |title=2011 Special Olympics Summer Games |work=The Atlantic Photo |date = July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with intellectual disabilities are encouraged to join Special Olympics for the physical activity, which helps lower the rate of cardiovascular disease and obesity, among other health benefits. Also, they gain many emotional and psychological benefits, including self-confidence, social competence, building greater athletic skills and higher self-esteem.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Driving Force&quot;/&gt; Exercise has also been shown to be related to a decrease in anxiety levels amongst people with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Carraro|first1=Attilio|last2=Gobbi|first2=Erica|date=2012-07-01|title=Effects of an exercise programme on anxiety in adults with intellectual disabilities|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|volume=33|issue=4|pages=1221–1226|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2012.02.014|pmid=22502848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To participate in Special Olympics, a person must be at least 8 years old and identified by an agency or professional as having one of the following conditions: intellectual disabilities, cognitive delays as measured by formal assessment, or significant learning or vocational problems due to cognitive delay that require or have required specially designed instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Common/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Frequently-Asked-Questions|website=Special Olympics|language=en|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For young people with and without intellectual disabilities ages 2–7, Special Olympics has a Young Athletes program—an inclusive sport and play program with a focus on activities that are important to mental and physical growth. Children engage in games and activities that develop motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Parents say their children in Young Athletes also develop better social skills. The confidence boost makes it easier for them to play and talk with other children on the playground and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/young_athletes.aspx |title=Young Athletes |publisher=Special Olympics |date=2014-05-06 |access-date=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Center for Social Development and Education (University of Massachusetts, Boston) found that the activities also had the effect of helping children with intellectual disabilities learn routines and approaches to learning, along with how to follow rules and directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:xXCaCGRpyVgJ:www.dec-sped.org/uploads/docs/conference/2012%2520Handouts/RES622%2520Young%2520Athletes%2520Intervention.pdf+%22center+for+social+development+and+education%22+%22special+olympics%22+%22young+athletes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShJeMIE5Bz08XSzCotEX17n7oAbE5iZSE8zmF7v-_2J0B3gifUNkgkZChkCLo79OZdlbu7sSsxq4shblS9GcWLrOfWHDpSUlunNl_-hdywUT2YVNUAYtNhC30CvEjvDN6d0I5eL&amp;sig=AHIEtbTk4fdv8kGX6GH-fy6M8ECv8YibAw |title=Google Drive Viewer |access-date=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families can also get involved with the Special Olympics experience. Family members support their athletes to the best of their ability, which may involve attending or volunteering at the events. By being involved they can boost their athlete's self-esteem and will be looked at as a constant source of encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/families.aspx |title=Our Families |work=specialolympics.org |access-date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers and supporters are an integral part of Special Olympics—and millions of people around the world are committed to its programs. Some are sponsors or donors. Many others are coaches, event volunteers and fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/Who_We_Are/Our_Volunteers.aspx |title=Volunteer for Special Olympics |work=specialolympics.org |access-date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coaches help the athletes be the best they can be regardless of ability—or disability. Special Olympics trains coaches through the Coaching Excellence program, which includes partnering with sports organizations. Special Olympics volunteers are introduced to lifetime friendships and great rewards.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

There are many events in which families and volunteers participate, but the biggest event is the [[Law Enforcement Torch Run]], which involves police chiefs, police officers, secret service, FBI agents, military police, sheriffs, state troopers, prison guards, and other law enforcement personnel assembling to raise awareness and funds for Special Olympics. Ahead of a Special Olympics competition, [[law enforcement]] officers carry the torch in intervals along a planned route covering most of the state or country to the site of the opening [[ceremonies]] of the chapter or Special Olympics World Summer or Winter Games. Then they pass the torch to a Special Olympics athlete and together they run up to the cauldron and light it, signifying the beginning of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.disabled-world.com/sports/special-olympics/flame-of-hope.php |title=Special Olympics Flame of Hope |date=2017-12-24 |website=Disabled World |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Special Olympics athlete's oath, which was first introduced by Eunice Kennedy Shriver at the inaugural Special Olympics international games in Chicago in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/eunice-kennedy-shriver-1921-2009-she-changed-the-world-for-people-with-mental-disabilities-128100168/115313.html |title=Eunice Kennedy Shriver, 1921–2009: She Changed the World for People with Mental Disabilities |publisher=Learningenglish.voanews.com |date=2011-08-19 |access-date=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; is &quot;Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.&quot; The origin of the oath came from Herbert J. Kramer, then Public Relations Advisor to the Kennedy Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bisd.us/specialservices/oath.htm |title=Origin of the Athlete Oath|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somd.org/Volunteer/Volunteer_General_Orientation_-_September_2012.pdf |title=Volunteer General Orientation – Special Olympics Maryland |access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports offered==
In 1968, track and field, swimming and floor hockey were the first three official sports offered by Special Olympics. As in the Olympics, events are introduced in training and then added to the competitive schedule, and from there the list of sports and events continued to grow.

Special Olympics has more than 30 Olympic-type individual and team sports that provide meaningful training and competition opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. As of 2016, these are:&lt;ref name=SO-Our-Sports&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/Sports-and-Games/Sports_and_Games.aspx | title = Our Sports | website = Special Olympics | publisher = The Joseph P.

Other sports and sports-related programs include the Motor Activity Training Program&lt;ref name=SO-Our-Sports/&gt; and Beach Volleyball. Availability of sports can depend on location and season.

A key difference between Special Olympics competitions and those of other sports organizations is that athletes of all ability levels are encouraged to participate. Competitions are structured so that athletes compete with other athletes of similar ability in equitable divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.specialolympics.org/Topics/Sports/Divisioning.aspx |title=Special Olympics: Divisioning |publisher=Resources.specialolympics.org |date=2014-05-06 |access-date=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An athlete's ability is the primary factor in divisioning Special Olympics competitions. The ability of an athlete or team is determined by an entry score from a prior competition or the result of a seeding round or preliminary event at the competition itself. Other factors that are significant in establishing competitive divisions are age and gender.

At competitions, medals are awarded to the first, second and third-place winners in each event, and ribbons are awarded to athletes who finish in fourth through eighth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.specialolympics.org/specialo.org/Special_/English/Coach/Coaching/Basics_o/Special_.htm#principles |title=Special Olympics: Sports and Games |publisher=Sports.specialolympics.org |date=2014-05-06 |access-date=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unified Sports==
In recent years, Special Olympics has pioneered the concept of Unified Sports, bringing together athletes with and without intellectual disabilities as teammates.&lt;ref name=&quot;specialolympics1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/unified-sports.aspx |title=Unified Sports |publisher=Special Olympics |access-date=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic concept is that training together and playing together can create a path to friendship and understanding. The program has expanded beyond the U.S. and North America: more than 1.4 million people worldwide now take part in Special Olympics Unified Sports.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite web|date=2018-08-03|title=Unified Sports|url=https://www.specialolympics.org/our-work/sports/unified-sports|access-date=2020-07-03|website=SpecialOlympics.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to break down stereotypes about people with intellectual disabilities and promote unity.&lt;ref name=&quot;specialolympics1&quot;/&gt;

Building on this, Special Olympics launched &quot;The Revolution Is Inclusion,&quot; inviting people worldwide to sign the Inclusion Pledge.&lt;ref&gt;jointherevolution.org/pledge&lt;/ref&gt;. This campaign aimed at celebrating all abilities began as Special Olympics marked its 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;jointherevolution.org&lt;/ref&gt; 

A recent study of Special Olympics Unified Sports in Serbia, Poland, Ukraine, Germany and Hungary documented the benefits of Unified Sports, including the effect of changing attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities. As one Unified Sports partner said, &quot;I am ashamed to say that I used to laugh at these people (people with intellectual disabilities), now I will tell anybody to stop laughing if I see it and I will stand up for people if I can.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.specialolympics.org/uploadedFiles/LandingPage/WhatWeDo/Final%20Report%20Unified%20Sports10%20Sept%202010.pdf|title = Unified Gives Us a Chance|access-date = June 4, 2017|website = specialolympics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other evaluations have also shown Unified Sports to be successful in building self-esteem and confidence in people with intellectual disabilities and also as a way to improve understanding and acceptance of people with intellectual disabilities among their non-disabled peers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt;

The Special Olympics Europe Eurasia Regional Research centre is based at the [[Ulster University|University of Ulster Jordanstown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/Stories/General/Special_Olympics_leads_the_way_in_the_field_of_research.aspx |title=Special Olympics leads the way in the field of research |last=Menke |first=Sabine  |date=December 1, 2014 |website=Special Olympics |language=en | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180716194811/https://www.specialolympics.org/Stories/General/Special_Olympics_leads_the_way_in_the_field_of_research.aspx | archive-date = 16 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of their 50th anniversary, the Special Olympics created the first Unified Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/50th/FirstEverUnifiedCup.aspx |title=Countdown to the Special Olympics Unified Cup |website=Special Olympics |language=en |access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first competition is a [[soccer]] tournament with 440 athletes from 24 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/07/17/special-olympics-50th-anniversary-2/ |title=400 Athletes Converge On Chicago For Special Olympics Anniversary |last=Victory |first=Lauren |date=2018-07-17 |work=CBS  |access-date=2018-07-19 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://abc7chicago.com/sports/special-olympics-unified-cup-kicks-off-tuesday/3771888/ |title=Special Olympics Unified Cup kicks off Tuesday |last=Varon |first=Roz |date=2018-07-16 |work=ABC7 Chicago |access-date=2018-07-19 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unified Robotics, a program that pairs Special Olympics students with [[For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology|FIRST Robotics]] students to build robots, began in 2016, and has been bringing opportunities for technological skill development to Special Olympics students in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], Arizona, and in other regions since. Special Olympics Arizona also promotes inclusion through Unified Arts programming including robotics, music, photography, art competitions, and gardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About – Special Olympics |url=http://unifiedrobotics.org/about/ |website=Special Olympics |access-date=26 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthy Athletes==
As Special Olympics began to grow, staffers and volunteers began to notice that athletes—children and adults with intellectual disabilities—also had many untreated health problems. In 1997, Special Olympics began an initiative called Healthy Athletes, which offers health screenings to athletes in need.&lt;ref name=&quot;specialolympics2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/healthy_athletes.aspx |title=Health Programs |publisher=Special Olympics |date=2014-05-06 |access-date=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthy Athletes currently offers health screenings in eight areas: Fit Feet (podiatry), FUNfitness (physical therapy), Health Promotion (better health and well-being), Healthy Hearing (audiology), MedFest (sports physical exam), Opening Eyes (vision), Special Smiles (dentistry), Strong Minds (Emotional Health). Screenings educate athletes on health and also identify problems that may need additional follow-up. For example, the FUNfitness Program assess flexibility, strength, balance, and aerobic fitness of the athlete. Following the screen, the physical therapist would provide instructions on how to optimize their physical fitness in the areas screened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/What_We_Do/Healthy_Athletes/Healthy_Athletes_FUNfitness.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Healthy Athletes FUNfitness|website=www.specialolympics.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Healthy Athletes program began, Special Olympics has become the largest global public health organization dedicated to serving people with intellectual disabilities. So far, more than 1.9 million Healthy Athletes screenings have been conducted for people with intellectual disabilities all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;specialolympics2&quot; /&gt;

The Special Olympics health initiative has attracted high-profile partners, including the Hear the World Foundation, which screened more than 1,000 athletes during the most recent World Winter Games in Korea; more than 200 of them were found to have hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hear-the-world.com/en/how-we-help/projects-worldwide/projects-2013/special-olympics.html |title=Special Olympics |publisher=Hear The World |access-date=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Stories/Healthy_Athletes/Forms/Healthy_Athletes_Stories.aspx |title=Healthy Athletes Stories |publisher=Special Olympics |access-date=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Special Olympics Healthy Communities initiative launched in eight countries—Kazakhstan, Malawi, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Romania, South Africa and Thailand, as well as six U.S. states. The goal is to improve the health and well-being of people with intellectual disabilities and allow them to reach their full potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholar Keith Storey summarized common objections in a 2004 article in ''Journal of Disability Policy Studies''. One criticism directed at the organization pertains to the role that corporate sponsors play in it, which critics feel has led to degrading [[paternalism]] toward athletic ability. While corporate fundraising makes the games possible, critics argue, it provides good public relations for the sponsors, but does not result in integration of people with disabilities into the workforce at those companies. People with disabilities are also not widely represented on the Special Olympics' board of directors, as only two members have disabilities. This has been criticized as a double standard that reflects poorly on the [[disability rights movement]] where people with disabilities control the service delivery system rather than relying on people without disabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Storey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last = Storey|first = Keith|title = The Case Against the Special Olympics|journal = Journal of Disability Policy Studies|year = 2004|volume = 15|issue = 1|pages = 35–42|doi = 10.1177/10442073040150010601|s2cid = 144279463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nelly Kim Furtado''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Prince Henry|ComIH]]}} ({{IPAc-en|f|ɜːr|ˈ|t|ɑː|d|oʊ}}, {{IPA-pt|fuɾˈtaðu|lang}}; born December 2, 1978) is a [[Portuguese Canadians|Portuguese-Canadian]] singer-songwriter and record producer. Furtado is known for her musical versatility and constant reinvention, commonly associated with [[world music]]. 

She first gained fame with her [[trip hop]] inspired debut album, ''[[Whoa, Nelly!]]'' (2000), which was a critical and commercial success that spawned two top 10 singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], &quot;[[I'm Like a Bird]]&quot; and &quot;[[Turn Off the Light]]&quot;. The first of the two singles won her a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. Furtado's introspective folk-heavy 2003 second album, ''[[Folklore (Nelly Furtado album)|Folklore]]'' explored her Portuguese roots. Its singles received moderate success in [[Europe]], but the album's underperformance compared to her debut was regarded as a [[sophomore slump]].

Furtado's third album, ''[[Loose (Nelly Furtado album)|Loose]]'' (2006), was a smash hit and became her best selling album with more than 12 million copies sold worldwide, also making it one of the best selling albums of the 2000s.&lt;ref name=&quot;canadianencyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/nelly-furtado|title=Nelly Furtado |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=2012 |access-date=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a radical image reinvention, Furtado continued to explore her Latin heritage while leaning heavier into [[hip hop]]. The album spawned four successful number one singles worldwide; &quot;[[Promiscuous (song)|Promiscuous]]&quot;, &quot;[[Maneater (Nelly Furtado song)|Maneater]]&quot;, &quot;[[Say It Right]]&quot;, and &quot;[[All Good Things (Come to an End)]]&quot;. Her [[Timbaland]] collaboration &quot;[[Give It to Me (Timbaland song)|Give It to Me]]&quot; (2007) in the same era also topped the charts in the US and overseas. Furtado's critically acclaimed duet with [[James Morrison (singer)|James Morrison]], &quot;[[Broken Strings (song)|Broken Strings]]&quot; also topped the charts in Europe in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fraser McAlpine |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2008/12/james_morrison_ft_nelly_furtad.shtml |title=Chart Blog: James Morrison ft. Nelly Furtado – 'Broken Strings' |publisher=BBC |date=2 December 2008 |access-date=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She released her first Spanish language album, ''[[Mi Plan]]'', in 2009, which won her a [[Latin Grammy Award]] for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album|Best Female Pop Vocal Album]]. In 2012, Furtado released her nostalgia inspired fifth album, ''[[The Spirit Indestructible]]''. Furtado split with her management and went independent thereafter, releasing her indie-pop sixth album, ''[[The Ride (Nelly Furtado album)|The Ride]]'' in 2017 under her own label [[:pt:Nelstar|Nelstar Entertainment]].

Furtado has sold over 40 million records worldwide, making her one of the most successful Canadian artists. She has won several [[List of awards and nominations received by Nelly Furtado|awards]] throughout her career, including one [[Grammy Award]] from seven nominations, one [[Latin Grammy Award]], ten [[Juno Awards]], one [[BRIT Award]], one [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Award]], one [[MTV Europe Music Award]], one [[World Music Award]], and three [[Much Music Video Awards]]. Furtado has a star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] and was awarded [[Order of Prince Henry|Commander of the Order of Prince Henry]] on February 28, 2014, in Toronto by [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]], the former [[President of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abola.pt/mundos/ver.aspx?id=463071|title=abola.pt|access-date=March 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511004718/http://www.abola.pt/mundos/ver.aspx?id=463071|archive-date=May 11, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ionline.pt/artigos/portugal/cavaco-condecora-personalidade-portuguesas-luso-canadiana-entre-quais-cantora-nelly|title=Cavaco condecora personalidade portuguesas e luso-canadiana, entre as quais a cantora Nelly Furtado|work=ionline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correiodosacores.info/index.php/destaques/5338-cavaco-silva-condecora-nelly-furtado-com-a-comenda-da-ordem-do-infante-d-henrique|title=Cavaco Silva condecora Nelly Furtado com a comenda da Ordem do Infante D.

== Early life ==
Furtado was born on December 2, 1978, in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. Her [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] parents, António José Furtado and Maria Manuela Furtado, were born on [[São Miguel Island]] in the [[Azores]]&lt;ref name=&quot;dmg&quot;&gt;[http://www.dailymusicguide.com/Interviews/nelly_furtado_interview.aspx Nelly Furtado Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525103401/http://www.dailymusicguide.com/Interviews/nelly_furtado_interview.aspx |date=May 25, 2008 }} at DailyMusicGuide.com&lt;/ref&gt; and had immigrated to Canada in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsjan01&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5918613/furtado_goes_portuguese/| title= Furtado Goes Portuguese |work= [[Rolling Stone]] |access-date= May 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelly was named after [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] gymnast [[Nellie Kim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ym&quot; /&gt; Her siblings are Michael Anthony and Lisa Anne. They were raised [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ym&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nellyfurtado/articles/story/5931858/fly_girl |title= Fly Girl |work= Rolling Stone |quote= ...raised their brood according to the traditions of their Roman Catholic faith. 'It was a big part of my life,' Furtado says about church. 'Very exciting and colorful. It was just so customary that I didn't really take the time to think about what everything meant, besides the basics. I still believe in the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[seven deadly sins|Seven Sins]]. It keeps me on the straight and narrow, though I get jealous of people sometimes who can just let go and give in to sin.' |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100408220527/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nellyfurtado/articles/story/5931858/fly_girl |archive-date= April 8, 2010 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; At age four, she began performing and singing in Portuguese.&lt;ref name=&quot;dmg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.netparque.pt/NPShowStory.asp?id=315351 |title= ENTREVISTA: NELLY FURTADO |work= netparque.pt |access-date= November 3, 2007 |url-status= dead |archive-url= http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080314173807/http%3A//www.netparque.pt/NPShowStory.asp?id%3D315351 |archive-date= March 14, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furtado's first public performance was when she sang a duet with her mother at a church on [[Portugal Day]]. She began playing musical instruments at the age of nine, learning the [[trombone]], [[ukulele]] and, in later years, the guitar and keyboards. At the age of 12, she began writing songs,&lt;ref name=&quot;ym&quot; /&gt; and as a teenager, she performed in a Portuguese [[marching band]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rsjan01&quot; /&gt; Furtado has acknowledged her family as the source of her strong work ethic; she spent eight summers working as a chambermaid with her mother, along with her brother and sister, who was a housekeeper in Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic| class= artist| id= p451535/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Nelly Furtado Biography| website= Allmusic |access-date =May 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== 1996–1999: Career beginnings ===
During a visit with her sister Lisa Anne in [[Toronto]] in mid-1995, Furtado met Tallis Newkirk, member of the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group Plains of Fascination. She contributed vocals to their 1996 album, ''Join the Ranks'', on the track &quot;Waitin' 4 the Streets&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelstar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelstar-project.com/about/nelstar|title=Nelstar* (Nelly Furtado) Biography|work=Nelstar-Project.com|access-date=December 9, 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060101212435/http://www.nelstar-project.com/about/nelstar/|archive-date=January 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Mount Douglas Secondary School]] in 1996, she moved to Toronto to reside with her sister Lisa Anne. The following year, she formed Nelstar, a [[trip hop]] duo with Newkirk. Ultimately, Furtado felt the trip hop style of the duo was &quot;too segregated&quot;, and believed it did not represent her personality or allow her to showcase her vocal ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelstar&quot; /&gt; She left the group and planned to move back home.

In 1997, she performed at the Honey Jam talent show.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelstar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;honeyjam&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/33869/honey-jam-searches-for-urban-women | title=Honey Jam Searches for Urban Women | work=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]] | date=May 27, 2003 | access-date=September 16, 2009 | first=Stephanie | last=Forrest | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330041829/http://www.chartattack.com/news/33869/honey-jam-searches-for-urban-women | archive-date=March 30, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her performance attracted the attention of [[The Philosopher Kings]] singer [[Gerald Eaton]], who then approached her to write with him. He and fellow Kings member [[Brian West (musician)|Brian West]] helped Furtado produce a demo. She left Toronto, but returned again to record more material with Eaton and West. The material recorded during these sessions was shopped to record companies by her attorney [[Chris Taylor (Music Attorney)|Chris Taylor]] and led to her 1999 record deal with [[DreamWorks Records]], signed by A&amp;R executive Beth Halper, partner of [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] drummer and record producer [[Butch Vig]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/nfu/bio.asp|title=Nelly Furtado Biography|work=MapleMusic|access-date=May 27, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123100037/http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/nfu/bio.asp|archive-date=November 23, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furtado's first single, &quot;[[Party's Just Begun (Again)]]&quot;, was released that year on the [[Brokedown Palace: Music from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack album]] for ''[[Brokedown Palace]]'' (1999).

=== 2000–2005: ''Whoa, Nelly!'' and ''Folklore'' ===
Furtado continued the collaboration with Eaton and West, who co-produced her debut album, ''[[Whoa, Nelly!]]'', which was released in October 2000. The album was an international success, supported by three international singles: &quot;[[I'm Like a Bird]]&quot;, &quot;[[Turn Off the Light]]&quot;, and &quot;[[...On the Radio (Remember the Days)]]&quot;. It received four Grammy nominations in 2002, and her debut single won for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].

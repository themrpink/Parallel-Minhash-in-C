'''Portable soup''' was a kind of [[Food preservation|dehydrated food]] used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a precursor of [[meat extract]] and [[bouillon cube]]s, and of industrially [[Food drying|dehydrated]] food. It is also known as '''pocket soup''' or '''veal glue'''. It is a cousin of the ''[[glace de viande]]'' of [[French cuisine|French cooking]]. It was long a staple of seamen and explorers, for it would keep for many months or even years. In this context, it was a filling and nutritious dish.  Portable soup of less extended vintage was, according to the 1881 ''[[Household Cyclopedia]]'',
&quot;exceedingly convenient for private families, for by putting one of the cakes in a saucepan with about a quart of water, and a little salt, a basin of good broth may be made in a few minutes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Culinary Arts: Plain Cookery&quot;, [http://www.mspong.org/cyclopedia/cookery.html ''Household Cyclopedia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328030211/http://www.mspong.org/cyclopedia/cookery.html |date=2013-03-28 }}, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Soup was made in the usual way, [[reduction (cooking)|reduced]], [[Degreasing|degreased]]—or the fat would go rancid—and then reduced repeatedly until it took on the consistency of jelly.  Once it was sufficiently gelatinous to hold its form, it was placed on pieces of flannel or unglazed earthenware dishes and rotated regularly to dry it further.  This was a seasonal process attempted only in the winter when [[humidity]] was low.  Once dry, it was wrapped in paper and stored in boxes.

==History==
===Hugh Plat===
In the late sixteenth century, Sir [[Hugh Plat]] wrote, in his unpublished notes, of portable soup as a potential [[military rations]] for the army and navy, describing it as meat broth boiled down to a thick and dry paste which he called &quot;Gelly&quot;. Plat's basic recipe was to boil the feet or legs of beef cattle for a long time to make &quot;a good broath&quot; which was then strained and boiled down to &quot;a strong &amp; stiff gelly&quot;. This in turn was dried on clean cloths in a windy place out of the sun, cut with wire into pieces, powdered with flour to stop the pieces from sticking, and stored in wooden boxes.

Made in March, it would &quot;keepe all the yeere&quot;. Alternatively, the dry jelly could be &quot;stamped&quot; into shape with a wooden die, like the [[Quince cheese|&quot;Genoa Paste&quot; of quinces]] familiar to Plat and other cooks of the time. He instructed that no sugar or salt should be added to the jelly because such taste would be concentrated by the boiling process, although he speculated that [[saffron]] might add colour, and that [[rosewater]] could also be added at this stage. He wondered whether baked flour or grated bread could be incorporated to make the jelly &quot;serve as bread and meate the better&quot;, and whether the addition of [[isinglass]] would make it stiffer. The jelly was variously described by Plat as a &quot;Victual for Warr&quot;, &quot;dry gelly carried to the sea&quot;, and a food for soldiers on the march. Plat envisaged using this jelly either as the base for soup, or &quot;neat&quot; as a concentrated food. Reconstitution as soup simply involved dissolving a piece of the jelly in hot water to make &quot;good broath&quot;, and, because jelly and water alone would be rather bland, adding such flavourings as were available or to taste – sugar, salt, liquorice, aniseed, or other &quot;convenient spice&quot;.

Plat emphasised the utility of the jelly as field rations, for &quot;a soldier may satisfie his hunger herwith, whilst hee is in his march&quot;. He recommended that a leg of beef or veal be boiled with every 6 or 8 neats' (cows') feet to produce a jelly which would more easily dissolve in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, Sloane MS 2244, fol. 29a; Sloane MS 2189, fols 119-119a. See also Malcolm Thick, ''Sir Hugh Plat: the search for useful knowledge in early modern England'' (Totnes, 2010), pp. 126–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of portable soups (called &quot;[[bouillon]]s en tablettes&quot; in French) is also mentioned, in 1690, in [[Antoine Furetière]]'s ''Dictionnaire universel'', under the article ''Tablette'': &quot;On a vue des consommés reduits en tablettes, ou des bouillons à porter en poche&quot;. (&quot;We have seen consommés reduced into tablets, or broth to carry in your pocket&quot;.){{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Mrs Dubois===
As a mass-produced product, portable soup is generally held to have been invented by Mrs Dubois, a [[Tavern#Great Britain|London tavern keeper]] who, with [[William Cookworthy]], won a contract to manufacture it for the [[Royal Navy]] in 1756. Mrs Dubois was described as &quot;a person of good character and circumstances&quot;. She operated from a tavern, at the Golden Head, in Three Kings Court in [[Fleet Street]]. She may have been the widow of a French chef and tavern keeper; but, by 1757, she had a new husband, Edward Bennet, son of a Sheffield knife-grinder. The contract with the navy was alluded to in advertising material long after it had lapsed, Benjamin Piper, successor in the business announced he was &quot;Successor to Messieurs Bennet and Dubois, The original Portable Soup-Makers to His majesty’s Royal Navy&quot; and one Vigor, successor to Piper, used the same rubric on his flyers.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary of Edward Bennet in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', vol. 59 (pt 1) (1789). Yorkshire Archaeological Society, MD335/1/6/4/6.&lt;/ref&gt; The naval authorities {{Clarify|date=November 2009}} hoped that portable soup would prevent [[scurvy]] among their crews. They therefore allotted a daily ration to each sailor beginning in the 1750s. [[Captain Cook]] was convinced of its efficacy and carried it on both his [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=James|date=1776|title=The Method Taken for Preserving the Health of the Crew of His Majesty's Ship the Resolution during Her Late Voyage Round the World.

[[Lewis and Clark]] carried portable soup on their 1804–1806 expedition into the territory of the newly acquired [[Louisiana Purchase]]. According to his letter from [[Fredericktown, Ohio]], on April 15, 1803, Lewis purchased the soup from Francois Baillet, a cook in [[Philadelphia]]. He paid $289.50 for the 193 pounds of portable soup stored in &quot;32 canisters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West |last= Ambrose |first= Steven E. |year= 1966 |publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster |location= New York |isbn= 0-684-81107-3 |pages=  |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/undauntedcourag000ambr }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis carried it with him overland to the embarkation point on the [[Ohio River]].

===Decline===
However, by 1815, with the publication of physician [[Gilbert Blane]]'s ''On the Comparative Health of the British Navy from 1779 to 1814'', the efficacy of portable soup for promoting the health of sailors was found lacking.  Opinion shifted in favor of [[canning|canned]] meats, by a process invented in France in 1806.

A similar product, portable [[gelatin]], was developed by American inventor [[Peter Cooper]] in 1845, as a staple meal or dessert for families.

'''Asparagus''', or '''garden asparagus''', folk name '''sparrow grass''',  scientific name '''''Asparagus officinalis''''', is a [[perennial]] [[flowering plant]] species in the genus ''[[Asparagus (genus)|Asparagus]]''. Its young shoots are used as a spring [[vegetable]]. 

It was once classified in the [[lily]] family, like the related ''[[Allium]]'' species, [[onion]]s and [[garlic]]. However, genetic research places lilies, ''Allium'', and asparagus in three separate families&amp;mdash;the [[Liliaceae]], [[Amaryllidaceae]], and [[Asparagaceae]], respectively&amp;mdash;with the Amaryllidaceae and Asparagaceae being grouped together in the order [[Asparagales]]. Sources differ as to the native range of ''Asparagus officinalis'', but generally include most of Europe and western [[temperate Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;POWO_531229-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:531229-1|title=Asparagus officinalis L.|last=Plants of the World Online.|date=n.d.|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Asparagus&amp;SPECIES_XREF=officinalis&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK=|title=Asparagus officinalis|last=Flora Europaea.|date=n.d.|publisher=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;empp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2.bgbm.org/_EuroPlusMed/PTaxonDetail.asp?NameId=38660&amp;PTRefFk=500000|title=Asparagus officinalis|last=Euro+Med Plantbase Project.|date=|publisher=Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811083221/http://ww2.bgbm.org/_EuroPlusMed/PTaxonDetail.asp?NameId=38660&amp;PTRefFk=500000|archivedate=11 August 2011|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grin&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely cultivated as a vegetable crop.

== History ==
Asparagus has been used as a vegetable owing to its distinct flavor, and in medicine due to its [[diuretic]] properties and its purported function as an [[aphrodisiac]]. It is pictured as an offering on an Egyptian [[frieze]] dating to 3000 BC. In ancient times, it was also known in Syria and in Spain. Greeks and Romans ate it fresh when in season, and dried the vegetable for use in winter. Roman [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] froze its sprouts high in the Alps for the Feast of [[Epicurus]]. Emperor [[Augustus]] created the &quot;Asparagus Fleet&quot; for hauling the vegetable, and coined the expression &quot;faster than cooking asparagus&quot; for quick action.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot; name=August&gt;Latin ''velocius quam asparagi conquantur'' (or ''celerius quam asparagi cocuntur''), ascribed to Augustus by [[Suetonius]] (''The Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Book 2 ''(Augustus), para. 87).

A recipe for cooking asparagus is given in one of the oldest surviving collections of recipes ([[Apicius]]'s third-century BC ''[[De re coquinaria]]'', Book III). In the second century AD, the Greek physician [[Galen]], highly respected within Roman society, mentioned asparagus as a beneficial herb, but as dominance of the Roman empire waned, asparagus' medicinal value drew little attention&lt;ref name=&quot;OBFP&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In the eleventh century AD the word &quot;sparagus&quot; appeared in an English text. See Brunning (June 2010), p. 6.&amp;nbsp;– Brunning uses the term &quot;in print&quot;, though no printing technique was used in England at the time. In the same sentence, she states that ''peasants'' often called it &quot;sparrow grass&quot;, and further on mentions a 1667 diary in which Samuel Pepys bought a bundle of &quot;sparrow grass&quot; in Fenchurch Street, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1469, asparagus was cultivated in French monasteries. Asparagus appears to have been little noticed in England until 1538,&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot; name=anno1000 /&gt; and in Germany until 1542.&lt;ref name=SAA_1 /&gt;

Asparagus was brought to North America by European settlers at least as early as 1655. Adriaen van der Donck, a Dutch immigrant to New Netherland, mentions asparagus in his description of Dutch farming practices in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Blackburn|first1=Roderic H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nK5Au-cvOTwC|title=New World Dutch Studies: Dutch Arts and Culture in Colonial America, 1609-1776 : Proceedings of the Symposium|last2=Kelley|first2=Nancy A.|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2989-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asparagus was grown by British immigrants as well; in 1685, one of William Penn's advertisements for Pennsylvania included asparagus in a long list of crops that grew well in the American climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Murphy|first=Andrew R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTpxDwAAQBAJ|title=William Penn: A Life|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-023426-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Only young asparagus shoots are commonly eaten: once the buds start to open (&quot;ferning out&quot;), the shoots quickly turn woody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/hort/ext/pubs/ho/ho_096.pdf |title=Growing Asparagus in the Home Garden; Section on harvesting |page=2 |publisher=Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asian-style cooking, asparagus is often [[stir-fried]].  [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]] restaurants in the United States often serve asparagus stir-fried with [[chicken]], [[shrimp]], or [[beef]]. It may also be quickly grilled over charcoal or hardwood embers, and is also used as an ingredient in some stews and soups. In recent years,{{when|date=August 2017}} asparagus eaten raw, as a component of a salad, has regained popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://123recipes.com/Recipe/A-To-Z-Salad/Detail Salad Recipe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719041545/http://123recipes.com/Recipe/A-To-Z-Salad/Detail |date=19 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asparagus can also be [[pickled]] and stored for several years. Some brands label shoots prepared in this way as &quot;marinated&quot;.

Stem thickness indicates the age of the plant (and not the age of the stalk), with the thicker stems coming from older plants. Older, thicker stalks can be woody, although peeling the skin at the base removes the tough layer. Peeled asparagus will poach much faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== White asparagus ===
[[File:Steam-boiling_green_asparagus.jpg|thumb|Steam boiling asparagus in a pot]]
White asparagus is very popular in Europe and western Asia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} White asparagus is the result of applying a [[Blanching (horticulture)|blanching]] technique while the asparagus shoots are growing. To cultivate white asparagus, the shoots are covered with soil as they grow, i.e. [[Hilling|earthed up]]; without exposure to sunlight, no [[photosynthesis]] starts, and the shoots remain white. Compared to green asparagus, the locally cultivated so-called &quot;white gold&quot; or &quot;edible ivory&quot; asparagus, also referred to as &quot;the royal vegetable&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;witgoud_12&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eten-en-drinken.infoyo.nl/producten/14450-wit-goud-en-koningin-der-groente-vorstelijke-asperges.html|title=Wit goud en koningin der groente: vorstelijke asperges|date=20 May 2009|publisher=Infoyo (web publisher)|location=Netherlands|language=Dutch|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119040848/http://eten-en-drinken.infoyo.nl/producten/14450-wit-goud-en-koningin-der-groente-vorstelijke-asperges.html|archive-date=19 January 2012|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is believed to be  less bitter and much more tender. Freshness is very important, and the lower ends of white asparagus must be peeled before cooking or raw consumption.

Only seasonally on the menu, asparagus dishes are advertised outside many restaurants, usually from late April to June. For the French style, asparagus is often boiled or steamed and served with [[Hollandaise sauce]], [[White sauce]], melted butter or most recently with olive oil and [[Parmesan cheese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KurMDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=asperge%20livre%20cuisine&amp;pg=PT354|chapter=“Chapitre XVI Légumes 71.Légumes” |author1=Jules Gouffé |author2=Etienne Antoine |author3=Eugène Ronjat|title=Le Livre de cuisine: Comprenant la cuisine de ménage et la grande cuisine, 1893.|date=5 August 2016 |isbn=9782346013760 |language=French|accessdate=28 April 2020}} (''Asperge'' is French for asparagus.)&lt;/ref&gt; Tall, narrow asparagus cooking pots allow the shoots to be steamed gently, their tips staying out of the water.

During the German ''Spargelsaison'' or ''Spargelzeit'' (&quot;asparagus season&quot; or &quot;asparagus time&quot;), the asparagus season that traditionally finishes on 24 June, roadside stands and open-air markets sell about half of the country's white asparagus consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans|first=Stephen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17753372|title=Asparagus, royalty and the joys of seasonal eating|date=21 April 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, especially in Maharashtra state, it is not usually cultivated, but grows naturally in the farms during monsoon. Farmers from rural area and some tribal people use the young asparagus plants as a vegetable in their meals.{{Citation needed|reason=this fact or claim is interesting but needs a reference; is it really mainly in Maharashtra and not the whole of India?|date=August 2020}}

== Cultivation ==
{{See also|List of asparagus diseases}}

Since asparagus often originates in maritime habitats, it thrives in soils that are too saline for normal weeds to grow. Thus, a little salt was traditionally used to suppress weeds in beds intended for asparagus; this has the disadvantage that the soil cannot be used for anything else. Some places are better for growing asparagus than others. The fertility of the soil is a large factor. &quot;Crowns&quot; are planted in winter, and the first shoots appear in spring; the first pickings or &quot;thinnings&quot; are known as sprue asparagus. Sprue has thin stems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A breed of &quot;early season asparagus&quot; that can be harvested two months earlier than usual was announced by a UK grower in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/8392483/New-breed-of-early-asparagus-hits-the-shelves.html|title=New breed of early asparagus hits the shelves|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 March 2011|accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variety does not need to lie dormant and blooms at {{convert|7|C|F}}, rather than the usual {{convert|9|C|F}}.

&lt;!-- Already given above: The [[blanching (horticulture)|blanching]] of white asparagus is obtained by the labour-intensive [[hilling]] cultivation method, to distinguish its gastronomical qualities from those of the green plant, which is the same botanical variety. --&gt;
Purple asparagus differs from its green and white counterparts in having high sugar and low fibre levels. Purple asparagus was originally developed in Italy, near the city of [[Albenga]] and commercialized under the variety name 'Violetto d' Albenga'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Raymond|first1=Francine|title=Asparagus: this season's hottest shades to grow|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/howtogrow/10842082/Asparagus-this-seasons-hottest-shades-to-grow.html|accessdate=21 May 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Companion planting ===
Asparagus is said to be a useful [[companion plant]] for [[tomato]]es, as the tomato plant repels the [[asparagus beetle]]. Asparagus may repel some harmful root nematodes that affect tomato plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Asparagus+officinalis|title=Plants for a Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When grown under [[polytunnel|tunnels]], growers can extend the harvest season. In the UK, it is estimated that the asparagus harvest season can begin as early as mid-February and continue into late autumn by growing cold-resistant cultivars under heated polytunnels. Furthermore, late season harvests can be achieved using 'reverse season growth' where spears are left to fern between March–August and harvested in September–October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hart |first1=Carolyn |title=Asparagus in autumn?

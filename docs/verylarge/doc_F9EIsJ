[[File:BismarckundNapoleonIII.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] talk after Napoleon's capture at the [[Battle of Sedan]], by [[Wilhelm Camphausen]]]]
On 1 September 1870, the battle opened with the Army of Châlons, with 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons and 564 guns, attacking the surrounding Prussian Third and Meuse Armies totaling 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons and 774 guns. [[Emmanuel Félix de Wimpffen|General De Wimpffen]], the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The French cavalry, commanded by [[Jean Auguste Margueritte|General Margueritte]], launched three desperate attacks on the nearby village of [[Floing, Ardennes|Floing]] where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated. Margueritte was killed leading the very first charge and the two additional charges led to nothing but heavy losses. By the end of the day, with no hope of breaking out, Napoleon III called off the attacks. The French lost over 17,000 men, killed or wounded, with 21,000 captured. The Prussians reported their losses at 2,320 killed, 5,980 wounded and 700 captured or missing. By the next day, on 2 September, Napoleon III surrendered and was taken prisoner with 104,000 of his soldiers. It was an overwhelming victory for the Prussians, for they not only captured an entire French army, but the leader of France as well. The defeat of the French at Sedan had decided the war in Prussia's favour. One French army was now immobilised and besieged in the city of Metz, and no other forces stood on French ground to prevent a German invasion. Nevertheless, the war would continue.

==War of the Government of National Defence==

===Government of National Defence===
[[File:ParisCafeDiscussion.png|thumb|&quot;Discussing the War in a Paris Café&quot;—a scene published in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' of 17 September 1870]]
When the news arrived at Paris of the surrender at Sedan of Napoleon III and {{nowrap|80,000 men,}} the Second Empire was overthrown by a popular uprising in Paris, which forced the proclamation of a Provisional Government and a [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] by general Trochu, [[Jules Favre|Favre]] and Gambetta at Paris on 4 September, the new government calling itself the [[Government of National Defence]].{{sfn|Baldick|1974|pp=20–21}} After the German victory at Sedan, most of the French standing army was either besieged in Metz or prisoner of the Germans, who hoped for an armistice and an end to the war. Bismarck wanted an early peace but had difficulty in finding a legitimate French authority with which to negotiate. The Government of National Defence had no electoral mandate, the Emperor was a captive and the Empress in exile but there had been no abdication ''de jure'' and the army was still bound by an oath of allegiance to the defunct imperial régime.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=228–231}}

The Germans expected to negotiate an end to the war but while the republican government was amenable to [[war reparations]] or ceding colonial territories in Africa or in South East Asia to Prussia, Favre on behalf of the Government of National Defense, declared on 6 September that France would not &quot;yield an inch of its territory nor a stone of its fortresses&quot;.{{sfn|Craig|1980|p=31}} The republic then renewed the declaration of war, called for recruits in all parts of the country and pledged to drive the German troops out of France by a {{lang|fr|[[Attaque à outrance|guerre à outrance]]}}.{{sfn|Howard|1979|p=234}} Under these circumstances, the Germans had to continue the war, yet could not pin down any proper military opposition in their vicinity. As the bulk of the remaining French armies were digging-in near Paris, the German leaders decided to put pressure upon the enemy by attacking Paris. By September 15, German troops reached the outskirts of Paris and Moltke issued the orders for an investment of the city. On September 19, the Germans surrounded it and erected a blockade, as already established at Metz, completing the encirclement on 20 September. Bismarck met Favre on 18 September at the [[Château de Ferrières]] and demanded a frontier immune to a French war of revenge, which included [[Strasbourg]], Alsace and most of the [[Moselle (department)|Moselle department]] in Lorraine of which Metz was the capital. In return for an armistice for the French to elect a National Assembly, Bismarck demanded the surrender of Strasbourg and the fortress city of [[Toul]]. To allow supplies into Paris, one of the perimeter forts had to be handed over. Favre was unaware that the real aim of Bismarck in making such extortionate demands was to establish a durable peace on the new western frontier of Germany, preferably by a peace with a friendly government, on terms acceptable to French public opinion. An impregnable military frontier was an inferior alternative to him, favoured only by the militant nationalists on the German side.{{sfn|Howard|1991|pp=230–233}}

When the war had begun, European public opinion heavily favoured the Germans; many Italians attempted to sign up as volunteers at the Prussian embassy in [[Florence]] and a Prussian diplomat visited [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in [[Caprera]]. Bismarck's demand that France surrender sovereignty over Alsace caused a dramatic shift in that sentiment in Italy, which was best exemplified by the reaction of Garibaldi soon after the revolution in Paris, who told the ''Movimento'' of Genoa on 7 September 1870 that &quot;Yesterday I said to you: war to the death to Bonaparte. Today I say to you: rescue the French Republic by every means.&quot;{{sfn|Ridley|1976|p=602}} Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the [[Army of the Vosges]], with which he operated around [[Dijon]] till the end of the war.

===Siege of Paris===

{{main|Siege of Paris (1870–1871)}}

Prussian forces commenced the [[Siege of Paris (1870)|Siege of Paris]] on 19 September 1870.  Faced with the blockade, the new French government called for the establishment of several large armies in the French provinces. These new bodies of troops were to march towards Paris and attack the Germans there from various directions at the same time. Armed French civilians were to create a guerilla force—the so-called ''[[Francs-tireurs]]''—for the purpose of attacking German [[supply line]]s.

These developments prompted calls from the German public for a bombardment of the city. Von Blumenthal, who commanded the siege, was opposed to the bombardment on moral grounds. In this he was backed by other senior military figures such as the Crown Prince and Moltke.

===Loire campaign===
Dispatched from Paris as the republican government emissary, Léon Gambetta flew over the German lines in a balloon inflated with coal gas from the city's gasworks and organized the recruitment of the Armée de la Loire. Rumors about an alleged German &quot;extermination&quot; plan infuriated the French and strengthened their support of the new regime. Within a few weeks, five new armies totalling more than 500,000 troops were recruited.{{sfn|Foley|2007|pp=19–20}}

The Germans dispatched some of their troops to the French provinces to detect, attack and disperse the new French armies before they could become a menace. The Germans were not prepared for an occupation of the whole of France.

[[File:Bapaume-tableau-Faidherbe.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Bapaume (1871)|Battle of Bapaume]] took place from 2–3 January 1871, during the Franco-Prussian War in and around Biefvillers-lès-Bapaume and Bapaume. The Prussian advance was stopped by Genéral Louis Léon César Faidherbe at the head of the ''Armée du Nord''.]]
On 10 October, hostilities began between German and French republican forces near [[Orléans]]. At first, the Germans were victorious but the French drew reinforcements and defeated a Bavarian force at the [[Battle of Coulmiers]] on 9 November. After the surrender of [[Siege of Metz (1870)|Metz]], more than 100,000 well-trained and experienced German troops joined the German 'Southern Army'. The French were forced to [[Second Battle of Orléans (1870)|abandon Orléans]] on 4 December, and were finally defeated at the [[Battle of Le Mans]] {{nowrap|(10–12 January)}}.  A second French army which operated north of Paris was turned back at the [[Battle of Amiens (1870)|Battle of Amiens]] (27 November), the [[Battle of Bapaume (1871)|Battle of Bapaume]] (3 January 1871) and the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1871)|Battle of St. Quentin]] (13 January).{{sfn| Shann | Delperier |1991|p=4}}

===Northern campaign===
Following the Army of the Loire's defeats, Gambetta turned to [[Louis Faidherbe|General Faidherbe]]'s Army of the North.{{sfn| Hozier | Davenport Adams |1872|p=217ff}} The army had achieved several small victories at towns such as Ham, La Hallue, and [[Amiens]] and was protected by the belt of fortresses in northern France, allowing Faidherbe's men to launch quick attacks against isolated Prussian units, then retreat behind the fortresses. Despite access to the armaments factories of [[Lille]], the Army of the North suffered from severe supply difficulties, which depressed morale. In January 1871, Gambetta forced Faidherbe to march his army beyond the fortresses and engage the Prussians in open battle. The army was severely weakened by low morale, supply problems, the terrible winter weather and low troop quality, whilst general Faidherbe was unable to command due to his poor health, the result of decades of campaigning in [[West Africa]]. At the Battle of St. Quentin, the Army of the North suffered a crushing defeat and was scattered, releasing thousands of Prussian soldiers to be relocated to the East.{{sfn| Ollier |1883|p=210}}

===Eastern campaign===
[[File:Armée-Bourb-en-Suisse.jpg|thumb|The French Army of the East is disarmed at the Swiss border in this 1881 depiction]]
Following the destruction of the French Army of the Loire, remnants of the Loire army gathered in eastern France to form the Army of the East, commanded by general [[Charles-Denis Bourbaki]]. In a final attempt to cut the German supply lines in northeast France, Bourbaki's army marched north to attack the Prussian siege of [[Belfort]] and relieve the defenders.

In the [[battle of the Lisaine]], Bourbaki's men failed to break through German lines commanded by General [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich August Leopold, Count von Werder|August von Werder]]. Bringing in the German 'Southern Army', General [[Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel|von Manteuffel]] then drove Bourbaki's army into the mountains near the Swiss border. Bourbaki attempted to commit suicide, but failed to inflict a fatal wound.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p.429&lt;/ref&gt; Facing annihilation, the last intact French army (now commanded by General [[Justin Clinchant]])&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p.421&lt;/ref&gt; crossed the border and was disarmed and interned by the neutral Swiss near [[Pontarlier]] (1 February).

===Armistice===

[[File:Pierre Puvis de Chavannes - Hope - Walters 37156.jpg|thumb|In this painting by [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]] a woman holds up an oak twig as a symbol of hope for the nation's recovery from war and deprivation after the Franco-Prussian War.{{sfn| de Chavannes |1872}} The Walters Art Museum.]]
On 26 January 1871 the Government of National Defence based in Paris negotiated an armistice with the Prussians. With Paris starving, and Gambetta's provincial armies reeling from one disaster after another, French foreign minister Favre went to [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] on 24 January to discuss peace terms with Bismarck. Bismarck agreed to end the siege and allow food convoys to immediately enter Paris (including trains carrying millions of German army rations), on condition that the Government of National Defence surrender several key fortresses outside Paris to the Prussians. Without the forts, the French Army would no longer be able to defend Paris.

Although public opinion in Paris was strongly against any form of surrender or concession to the Prussians, the Government realised that it could not hold the city for much longer, and that Gambetta's provincial armies would probably never break through to relieve Paris. President Trochu resigned on 25 January and was replaced by Favre, who signed the surrender two days later at Versailles, with the armistice coming into effect at midnight. Several sources claim that in his carriage on the way back to Paris, Favre broke into tears, and collapsed into his daughter's arms as the guns around Paris fell silent at midnight. At [[Bordeaux]], Gambetta received word from Paris on 29 January that the Government had surrendered. Furious, he refused to surrender. [[Jules Simon]], a member of the Government arrived from Paris by train on 1 February to negotiate with Gambetta. Another group of three ministers arrived in Bordeaux on 5 February and the following day Gambetta stepped down and surrendered control of the provincial armies to the Government of National Defence, which promptly ordered a cease-fire across France.

==War at sea==

===Blockade===
When the war began, the French government ordered a [[blockade]] of the North German coasts, which the small [[North German Federal Navy]] with only five [[ironclad warship|ironclads]] and various minor vessels could do little to oppose. For most of the war, the three largest German ironclads were out of service with engine troubles; only the [[turret ship]] {{SMS|Arminius}} was available to conduct operations. By the time engine repairs had been completed, the French fleet had already departed.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=101–102}} The blockade proved only partially successful due to crucial oversights by the planners in Paris. Reservists that were supposed to be at the ready in case of war, were working in the Newfoundland fisheries or in Scotland. Only part of the 470-ship [[French Navy]] put to sea on 24 July. Before long, the French navy ran short of [[coal]], needing {{convert|200|ST|t}} per day and having a bunker capacity in the fleet of only {{convert|250|ST|t}}. A blockade of Wilhelmshaven failed and conflicting orders about operations in the [[Baltic Sea]] or a return to France, made the French naval efforts futile. Spotting a blockade-runner became unwelcome because of the {{lang|fr|question du charbon}}; pursuit of Prussian ships quickly depleted the coal reserves of the French ships.{{sfn|Rüstow|1872|pp=229–235}}{{sfn|Wawro|2003|p=191}}

To relieve pressure from the expected German attack into Alsace-Lorraine, Napoleon III and the French high command planned a [[amphibious warfare|seaborne invasion]] of northern Germany as soon as war began. The French expected the invasion to divert German troops and to encourage Denmark to join in the war, with its 50,000-strong army and the [[Royal Danish Navy]]. It was discovered that Prussia had recently built defences around the big North German ports, including [[coastal artillery]] batteries with Krupp heavy artillery, which with a range of {{convert|4000|yd|m|sigfig=2}}, had double the range of French naval guns. The French Navy lacked the heavy guns to engage the coastal defences and the [[topography]] of the Prussian coast made a seaborne invasion of northern Germany impossible.{{sfn|Wawro|2003|pp=190–192}}

The [[Troupes de marine|French Marines]] and [[naval infantry]] intended for the invasion of northern Germany were dispatched to reinforce the French Army of Châlons and fell into captivity at Sedan along with Napoleon III. A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the ''Garde Mobile''.{{sfn|Wawro|2003|p=192}} As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter. The rest of the navy retired to ports along the [[English Channel]] and remained in port for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Wawro|2003|p=192}}

===Analysis===
[[File:Christian Sell Winterfeldzug 1870.jpg|thumb|German [[uhlans]] and an infantryman escorting captured French soldiers]]

France had suffered a crushing defeat: the loss of Alsace and much of Lorraine; The map contains satirical comments on 14 countries]]
The quick German victory over the French stunned neutral observers, many of whom had expected a French victory and most of whom had expected a long war. The strategic advantages which the Germans had were not appreciated outside Germany until after hostilities had ceased. Other countries quickly discerned the advantages given to the Germans by their military system, and adopted many of their innovations, particularly the General Staff, universal conscription, and highly detailed mobilization systems.{{sfn|van Creveld|1977|p=96}}

The Prussian General Staff developed by Moltke proved to be extremely effective, in contrast to the traditional French school. This was in large part because the Prussian General Staff was created to study previous Prussian operations and learn to avoid mistakes. The structure also greatly strengthened Moltke's ability to control large formations spread out over significant distances.{{sfn|Howard|1991|p=23}} The Chief of the General Staff, effectively the commander in chief of the Prussian army, was independent of the minister of war and answered only to the monarch.{{sfn|Irvine|1938|p=192}} The French General Staff—along with those of every other European military—was little better than a collection of assistants for the line commanders. This disorganization hampered the French commanders' ability to [[command and control|exercise control]] of their forces.{{sfn|Howard|1991|pp=23–24}}

In addition, the Prussian military education system was superior to the French model; Prussian staff officers were trained to [[auftragstaktik|exhibit initiative and independent thinking]]. Indeed, this was Moltke's expectation.{{sfn|Holborn|1942|p=159}} The French, meanwhile, suffered from an education and promotion system that stifled intellectual development. According to the military historian Dallas Irvine, the system &quot;was almost completely effective in excluding the army's brain power from the staff and high command. To the resulting lack of intelligence at the top can be ascribed all the inexcusable defects of French military policy.&quot;{{sfn|Irvine|1938|p=192}}

[[Albrecht von Roon]], the [[Prussian Minister of War]] from 1859 to 1873, put into effect a series of reforms of the Prussian military system in the 1860s. Among these were two major reforms that substantially increased the military power of Germany. The first was a reorganization of the army that integrated the regular army and the ''[[Landwehr]]'' reserves.{{sfn|Howard|1991|pp=19–20}} The second was the provision for the [[conscription]] of every male Prussian of military age in the event of mobilization.{{sfn|Howard|1991|p=21}} Thus, although the population of France was greater than the population of all of the Northern German states that participated in the war, the Germans mobilized more soldiers for battle.

At the start of the Franco-Prussian War, 462,000 German soldiers concentrated on the French frontier while only 270,000 French soldiers could be moved to face them, the French army having lost 100,000 stragglers before a shot was fired, through poor planning and administration.{{sfn|McElwee|1974|p=46}} This was partly due to the peacetime organisations of the armies. Each Prussian Corps was based within a ''Kreis'' (literally &quot;circle&quot;) around the chief city in an area. Reservists rarely lived more than a day's travel from their regiment's depot. By contrast, French regiments generally served far from their depots, which in turn were not in the areas of France from which their soldiers were drawn. Reservists often faced several days' journey to report to their depots, and then another long journey to join their regiments. Large numbers of reservists choked railway stations, vainly seeking rations and orders.{{sfn|Howard|1991|p=68}}

The effect of these differences was accentuated by the peacetime preparations. The Prussian General Staff had drawn up minutely detailed [[mobilization]] plans using the railway system, which in turn had been partly laid out in response to recommendations of a Railway Section within the General Staff. The French railway system, with competing companies, had developed purely from commercial pressures and many journeys to the front in Alsace and Lorraine involved long diversions and frequent changes between trains. There was no system of military control of the railways and officers simply commandeered trains as they saw fit. Rail [[Siding (rail)|sidings]] and [[marshalling yard]]s became choked with loaded wagons, with nobody responsible for unloading them or directing them to the destination.{{sfn|Howard|1991|pp=70–71}}

Although [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Denmark]] had both wished to avenge their recent military defeats against Prussia, they chose not to intervene in the war due to a lack of confidence in the French. Napoleon III also failed to cultivate alliances with the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], partially due to the diplomatic efforts of the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck, and thus faced the German states alone.

The French [[breech-loading rifle]], the [[Chassepot]], had a far longer range than the German needle gun; {{convert|1500|yd}} compared to {{convert|600|yd|abbr=on}}. The French also had an early machine-gun type weapon, the [[mitrailleuse]], which could fire its thirty-seven barrels at a range of around {{convert|1200|yd|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Wawro|2003|pp=52–53}} It was developed in such secrecy that little training with the weapon had occurred, leaving French gunners with no experience; the gun was treated like artillery and in this role it was ineffective. Worse still, once the small number of soldiers who had been trained how to use the new weapon became casualties, there were no replacements who knew how to operate the mitrailleuse.{{sfn|Bailey|2004|p=217}}

The French were equipped with bronze, rifled [[muzzle-loading]] artillery, while the Prussians used new steel breech-loading guns, which had a far longer range and a faster rate of fire.{{sfn|Howard|1991|pp=35–36}} Prussian gunners strove for a high rate of fire, which was discouraged in the French army in the belief that it wasted ammunition. In addition, the Prussian artillery batteries had 30% more guns than their French counterparts. The Prussian guns typically opened fire at a range of {{convert|2|–|3|km|mi}}, beyond the range of French artillery or the Chassepot rifle. The Prussian batteries could thus destroy French artillery with impunity, before being moved forward to directly support infantry attacks.{{sfn|Bailey|2004|pp=216–217}} The Germans fired 30,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition and 362,662 field artillery rounds.{{sfn|German General Staff|1884|p=195}}

===Effects on military thought===
The events of the Franco-Prussian War had great influence on military thinking over the next forty years. Lessons drawn from the war included the need for a general staff system, the scale and duration of future wars and the tactical use of artillery and cavalry. The bold use of artillery by the Prussians, to silence French guns at long range and then to directly support infantry attacks at close range, proved to be superior to the defensive doctrine employed by French gunners. The Prussian tactics were adopted by European armies by 1914, exemplified in the [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|French 75]], an artillery piece optimised to provide direct fire support to advancing infantry. Most European armies ignored the evidence of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of {{nowrap|1904–1905}} which suggested that infantry armed with new smokeless-powder rifles could engage gun crews effectively. This forced gunners to fire at longer range using [[indirect fire]], usually from a position of cover.{{sfn|Bailey|2004|pp=218–219}} The heavy use of fortifications and dugouts in the Russo-Japanese war also greatly undermined the usefulness of Field Artillery which was not designed for indirect fire.

At the [[Battle of Mars-la-Tour|Battle of Mars-La-Tour]], the Prussian 12th Cavalry Brigade, commanded by General [[Adalbert von Bredow]], conducted a charge against a French artillery battery. The attack was a costly success and came to be known as &quot;von Bredow's Death Ride&quot;, but which nevertheless was held to prove that cavalry charges could still prevail on the battlefield. Use of traditional cavalry on the battlefields of 1914 proved to be disastrous, due to accurate, long-range rifle fire, machine-guns and artillery.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=156–157}} Bredow's attack had succeeded only because of an unusually effective artillery bombardment just before the charge, along with favorable terrain that masked his approach.{{sfn|Bailey|2004|p=218}}{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=156–157}}

===Casualties===
The Germans deployed a total of 33,101 officers and 1,113,254 men into France, of which they lost 1,046 officers and 16,539 enlisted men killed in action. Another 671 officers and 10,050 men died of their wounds, for total battle deaths of 28,306. Disease killed 207 officers and 11,940 men, with [[typhoid]] accounting for 6,965. 4,009 were missing and presumed dead; 290 died in accidents and 29 committed suicide. Among the missing and captured were 103 officers and 10,026 men. The wounded amounted to 3,725 officers and 86,007 men.{{sfn|Clodfelter|2017|p=187}}

French battle deaths were 77,000, of which 41,000 were killed in action and 36,000 died of wounds. More than 45,000 died of sickness. Total deaths were 138,871, with 136,540 being suffered by the army and 2,331 by the navy. The wounded totaled 137,626; 131,000 for the army and 6,526 for the navy. French prisoners of war numbered 383,860. In addition, 90,192 French soldiers were interned in Switzerland and 6,300 in Belgium.{{sfn|Clodfelter|2017|p=187}}

During the war the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) established an international tracing agency in [[Basel]] for prisoners of that war. The holdings of the &quot;Basel Agency&quot; were later transferred to the ICRC headquarters in [[Geneva]] and integrated into the [[International Committee of the Red Cross archives|ICRC archives]], where they are accessible today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=30 April 2016|title=Agency Archives|url=https://blogs.icrc.org/cross-files/individual-archives/|access-date=28 July 2020|website=International Committee of the Red Cross - CROSS-files}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==

===Prussian reaction and withdrawal===
[[File:S95francoprussian.jpg|thumb|Prussian parade in Paris in 1871]]
[[File:Europe 1871 map en.png|thumb|Europe after the Franco-Prussian War and the unification of Germany]]
The Prussian Army, under the terms of the armistice, held a brief [[victory parade]] in Paris on 17 February; the city was silent and draped with black and the Germans quickly withdrew. Bismarck honoured the armistice, by allowing train loads of food into Paris and withdrawing Prussian forces to the east of the city, prior to a full withdrawal once France agreed to pay a [[French indemnity|five billion franc war indemnity]].{{sfn| Taylor |1955|p=133}} The indemnity was proportioned, according to population, to be the exact equivalent to the indemnity imposed by [[Napoleon]] on Prussia in [[Treaties of Tilsit|1807]].{{sfn| Taylor |1955|p=133}} At the same time, Prussian forces were concentrated in the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. An exodus occurred from Paris as some 200,000 people, predominantly middle-class, went to the countryside.

===Paris Commune===
{{See also|Paris Commune}}
During the war, the [[National Guard (France)|Paris National Guard]], particularly in the working-class neighbourhoods of Paris, had become highly politicised and units elected officers; many refused to wear uniforms or obey commands from the national government.  National guard units tried to seize power in Paris on 31 October 1870 and 22 January 1871.  On 18 March 1871, when the regular army tried to remove cannons from an artillery park on [[Montmartre]], National Guard units resisted and killed two army generals. The national government and regular army forces retreated to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] and a revolutionary government was proclaimed in Paris. A [[commune]] was elected, which was dominated by socialists, anarchists and revolutionaries. The [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] replaced the [[Flag of France|French tricolour]] and a civil war began between the Commune and the regular army, which attacked and recaptured Paris from {{nowrap|21–28 May}} in the {{lang|fr|Semaine Sanglante}} (bloody week).{{sfn|Wawro|2003|pp=301, 310}}{{sfn|Baldick|1974|p=209}}

During the fighting, the [[Communards]] killed around 500 people, including [[Georges Darboy]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris|Archbishop of Paris]], and burned down many government buildings, including the [[Tuileries Palace]] and the [[Hotel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]].{{sfn|Horne|1965|p=416}} Communards captured with weapons were routinely shot by the army and Government troops killed between 7,000 and 30,000 Communards, both during the fighting and in massacres of men, women, and children during and after the Commune.{{sfn|Rougerie|1995|p=118}}{{sfn|Baldick|1974|p=209}}{{sfn|Wawro|2000|p=122}}{{sfn|Wawro|2003|p=301}}  More recent histories, based on studies of the number buried in Paris cemeteries and in mass graves after the fall of the Commune, put the number killed at between 6,000 and 10,000.{{sfn|Rougerie|2014|p=118}} Twenty-six courts were established to try more than {{nowrap|40,000 people}} who had been arrested, which took until 1875 and imposed {{nowrap|95 death}} sentences, of which {{nowrap|23 were}} inflicted. Forced labour for life was imposed on {{nowrap|251 people,}} {{nowrap|1,160 people}} were transported to &quot;a fortified place&quot; and {{nowrap|3,417 people}} were transported. About {{nowrap|20,000 Communards}} were held in prison hulks until released in 1872 and a great many Communards fled abroad to Britain, Switzerland, Belgium or the United States. The survivors were amnestied by a bill introduced by Gambetta in 1880 and allowed to return.{{sfn|Horne|1965|pp=422–424}}

===German unification and power===
{{further|Unification of Germany}}

[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the German Empire, painted by [[Anton von Werner]]]]
The creation of a unified [[German Empire]] (aside from Austria) greatly disturbed the balance of power that had been created with the Congress of Vienna after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Germany had established itself as a major power in continental Europe, boasting the most powerful and professional army in the world.{{sfn| Kennedy |1987}} Although Britain remained the dominant world power overall, British involvement in European affairs during the late 19th century was limited, owing to its focus on colonial empire-building, allowing Germany to exercise great influence over the European mainland.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Anglo-German straining of tensions was somewhat mitigated by several prominent relationships between the two powers, such as the Crown Prince's marriage with the daughter of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

===French reaction and Revanchism===
The defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the birth of [[Revanchism]] (literally, &quot;revenge-ism&quot;) in France, characterised by a deep sense of bitterness, hatred and demand for revenge against Germany. This was particularly manifested in loose talk of another war with Germany in order to reclaim Alsace and Lorraine.{{sfn| Varley |2008a|pp=62–80}}{{sfn| Varley |2008b}} It also led to the development of nationalist ideologies emphasising &quot;the ideal of the guarded, self-referential nation schooled in the imperative of war&quot;, an ideology epitomised by figures such as General [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]] in the 1880s.{{sfn| Brown |2010}} Paintings that emphasized the humiliation of the defeat became in high demand, such as those by [[Alphonse de Neuville]].{{sfn| Jay |1984|pp=151–162}} Revanchism was not a major cause of war in 1914 because it faded after 1880. J.F.V. Keiger says, &quot;By the 1880s Franco-German relations were relatively good.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; J.F.V. Keiger, ''France and the World since 1870'' (2001) pp 112–120, quoting p 113.&lt;/ref&gt;  The French public had very little interest in foreign affairs and elite French opinion was strongly opposed to war with its more powerful neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Wright, ''France in Modern Times'' (5th ed. 1995) pp 288–299.&lt;/ref&gt;  The elites were now calm and considered it a minor issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan Mitchell|title=The German Influence in France after 1870: The Formation of the French Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQZfDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT190|year=2018|page=190|isbn=9781469622927}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The  Alsace-Lorraine issue remained a minor theme after 1880, and Republicans and Socialists systematically downplayed the issue. Return did become a French war aim until after [[World War I]] began. &lt;ref&gt;Frederic H. Seager, &quot;The Alsace-Lorraine Question in France, 1871-1914.&quot; ''From the Ancien Régime to the Popular Front: Essays in the History of Modern France'' edited by Charles K. Warner, (1969): 111-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Malcolm Carroll, ''French Public Opinion and Foreign Affairs: 1870-1914'' (1931) pp 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite 16th-century writer [[Andrew Boorde]]'s claim that &quot;Bryght-Hempston [is] among the noble ports and havens of the realm&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lower247&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lower|1864|p=247.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brighton never developed as a significant port: rather, it was considered as part of [[Shoreham-by-Sea|Shoreham]].  Nevertheless, the descriptions  &quot;Port of Brighthelmston&quot; or &quot;Port of Brighton&quot; were sometimes used between the 14th and 19th centuries, as for example in 1766 when its notional limits were defined for customs purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB128&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 128.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The East Cliff runs for several miles from Pool Valley towards [[Rottingdean]] and [[Saltdean]], reaching {{convert|80|ft|m|order=flip}} above sea level. The soil beneath it, a mixture of [[alluvium]] and clay with some flint and chalk [[rubble]], has experienced erosion for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB56&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 56.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cliff itself, like the rest of Brighton's soil, is chalk.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCH56961&quot;/&gt; Below this are thin layers of [[Greensand#Upper Greensand|Upper]] and [[Greensand (geology)|Lower Greensand]] separated by a thicker band of [[Gault|Gault clay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HistAtlas3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Leslie|Short|1999|p=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land slopes upwards gradually from south to north towards the top of the Downs.

Main transport links developed along the floor of the Wellesbourne valley, from which the land climbs steeply—particularly on the east side. The earliest settlement was by the beach at the bottom of the valley,&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB15&quot;/&gt; which was partly protected from erosion by an underwater [[Shoal|shale-bar]]. Changes in sea level affected the foreshore several times: {{convert|40|acre|ha}} disappeared in the first half of the 14th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB43&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 43.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Storm of 1703]] caused widespread destruction. The first sea defences were erected in 1723,&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB43&quot;/&gt; and a century later a long sea-wall was built.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB56&quot;/&gt;

===Climate===
{{See also|Climate of the United Kingdom}}
Brighton has a [[Temperateness|temperate]] climate: its [[Köppen climate classification#GROUP C: Temperate/mesothermal climates|Köppen climate classification]] is ''Cfb''. It is characterised by cool summers, and cool winter with frequent cloudy and rainy periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB40&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 40.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average rainfall levels increase as the land rises: the 1958–1990 mean was {{convert|740|mm|in}} on the seafront and about {{convert|1000|mm|in}} at the top of the South Downs above Brighton.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB40&quot;/&gt; Storms caused serious damage in [[Great Storm of 1703|1703]], 1806, 1824, 1836, 1848, 1850, 1896, 1910 and [[Great Storm of 1987|1987]]. Heavy snow is rare, but particularly severe falls were recorded in 1881 and 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB40&quot;/&gt;

At the time of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] in 1086, Brighton was in the [[Rape of Lewes]] and the [[Hundred (county division)#England and Wales|Hundred]] of Welesmere. The new Hundred of Whalesbone, which covered the parishes of Brighton, [[West Blatchington]], [[Preston Village, Brighton|Preston]] and [[Hove]], was formed in 1296. Parishes moved in and out several times, and by 1801 only Brighton and [[West Blatchington]] were included in the Hundred.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCH56959&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol7/p241|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7 – The Rape of Lewes. The hundred of Whalesbone|editor-last=Salzman|editor-first=L.F. |editor-link=Louis Francis Salzman|year=1940|website=[[Victoria County History]] of Sussex|publisher=British History Online|page=241|access-date=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original form, Brighton parish covered about {{convert|1640|acre|ha}} between the English Channel, Hove, Preston, [[Ovingdean]] and [[Rottingdean]]. The borough (but not the civil parish) was first extended from 31 October 1873, when {{convert|905|acre|ha}} was annexed from Preston civil parish. In 1894 the part outside the borough became Preston Rural civil parish and Preston civil parish continued in the borough. On 1 April 1889 Brighton became a county borough.

On 1 October 1923, {{convert|94|acre|ha}} were added to Brighton borough and to Preston civil parish from Patcham parish: Brighton Corporation was developing the [[Moulsecoomb]] [[Council house|estate]] there at the time. On 1 April 1928, Brighton civil parish was extended to include Preston civil parish. On the same date the borough grew by nearly five times by adding Ovingdean and Rottingdean parishes in their entirety and parts of [[Falmer]], Patcham and West Blatchington; it also exchanged small parts with Hove municipal borough. All the areas added to the borough became part of Brighton civil parish.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB34&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=34.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 April 1952, more of Falmer and part of the adjacent [[Stanmer]] parish were added; 20 years later, land and marine territory associated with the new [[Brighton Marina]] development also became part of Brighton. Except for a small addition of rural land in 1993 (from [[Pyecombe]] parish), Brighton Borough's boundaries remained the same until it was joined to Hove Borough in 1997 to form the [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]] of Brighton and Hove.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB35&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=35.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old boundary between Brighton and Hove is most clearly seen on the seafront, where the King Edward Peace Statue (1912) straddles the border, and in a [[Alley|twitten]] called Boundary Passage which runs northwards from Western Road to Montpelier Road.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutBtn57&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dale|1986|p=57.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[Listed building|Grade II-listed]] parish boundary marker stone in this passageway.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE-1380005&quot;&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|desc=Boundary Stone Approximately 40 Metres North of Western Road, Boundary Passage, Brighton|num=1380005|grade=II|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between Western Road and the seafront, the boundary runs up Little Western Street (pavement on eastern side, in Brighton), but it is not visible.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutBtn57&quot;/&gt; Northwards from Western Road, it runs to the west of Norfolk Road, Norfolk Terrace, Windlesham Road and Windlesham Gardens in the [[Montpelier, Brighton|Montpelier]] area, then along the south side of Davigdor Road to [[Seven Dials, Brighton|Seven Dials]]. From there it runs along the west side of Dyke Road as far as Withdean Road in [[Withdean]], at which point it crosses Dyke Road so that the section north of that is part of Hove parish. The boundary continues to follow Dyke Road towards [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]] on the South Downs.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&amp;HMap-1960&quot;&gt;{{cite map|publisher=G.I.

==Governance and politics==
[[File:Caroline Lucas 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|Brighton Pavilion MP [[Caroline Lucas]] is the only Green MP in the UK Parliament.]]
Brighton is covered by two constituencies in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]: [[Brighton Kemptown (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Kemptown]] and [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Pavilion]]. Both are [[Marginal seat|marginal constituencies]] which were held by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] from 1997 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/2015guide/brightonkemptown/ |title=Brighton, Kemptown |year=2004–2014 |website=UK Polling Report website |publisher=Anthony Wells |accessdate=7 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TBEt4q9R?url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/2015guide/brightonkemptown/ |archivedate=8 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}

In the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] Brighton Pavilion elected [[Caroline Lucas]], the first [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] MP; she was re-elected in [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], 2017 and again at the 2019 general election.

As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there are 21 wards in the city of Brighton and Hove, of which 12 are in Brighton. Regency, St Peter's &amp; North Laine, Preston Park, Withdean, Patcham, Hollingdean &amp; Stanmer and Hanover &amp; Elm Grove are part of the Brighton Pavilion constituency; Moulsecoomb &amp; Bevendean, Queen's Park, East Brighton, Woodingdean and Rottingdean Coastal are covered by the Brighton Kemptown constituency.&lt;ref name=&quot;BHCC-Wards&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/Councillor%20Ward%20Map_aug2013.pdf |title=Ward Map |date=August 2013 |publisher=Brighton and Hove City Council |accessdate=6 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106220119/http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/Councillor%20Ward%20Map_aug2013.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2014 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly created Borough of Brighton consisted of six wards in 1854: St Nicholas, St Peter, Pier, Park, Pavilion and West. When the territory was extended to include part of [[Preston Village, Brighton|Preston]] parish in 1873, the new area became a seventh ward named Preston. The seven were split into 14 in 1894: Hanover, Kemp Town (renamed King's Cliff in 1908), Lewes Road, Montpelier, Pavilion, Pier, Preston, Preston Park, Queen's Park, Regency, St John, St Nicholas, St Peter, and West. Preston ward was extended in 1923 to incorporate the area taken into the borough from Patcham parish in 1923 for the construction of the Moulsecoomb estate, and in 1928 the ward was divided into four: Hollingbury, Moulsecoomb, Preston and Preston Park. Elm Grove and Patcham wards were created at the same time, bringing the total to 19. There were further changes in 1952, 1955 and 1983, at which time there were 16 wards.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB47&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§47.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation continued until 1 April 1997, when Hove and its wards became part of the new [[unitary authority]] of [[Brighton and Hove]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB156&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=156.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brighton Town Hall (IoE Code 479446).jpg|thumb|right|[[Brighton Town Hall (Brighton and Hove)|Brighton Town Hall]] dates from 1830.]]
[[Brighton Town Hall (Brighton and Hove)|Brighton Town Hall]] occupies a large site in [[The Lanes]]. Medieval Brighthelmston had a town hall, although it was called the Townhouse and functioned more like a market hall. A later building (1727) known as the Town Hall was principally used as a [[workhouse]]. Work on the first purpose-built town hall began in 1830; [[Thomas Read Kemp]] laid the first stone, and Thomas Cooper designed it on behalf of the Brighton Town Commissioners (of which he was a member). Brighton Corporation spent £40,000 to extend it in 1897–99 to the [[Classical architecture|Classical]] design of Brighton Borough Surveyor Francis May. Despite this, the building was too small for municipal requirements by the mid-20th century, and extra council buildings were built in various locations throughout Brighton Borough Council's existence: the most recent, Bartholomew House and Priory House next to the town hall, were finished in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB341–342&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=341–342.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Antram72&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=72.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town hall ceased to be responsible solely for Brighton's affairs when Brighton and Hove were united in 1997, but it is still used by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council—particularly for weddings and civil ceremonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;BHCC-TownHall&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/community-and-life-events/births-deaths-and-marriages/ceremonies-brighton-town-hall |title=Ceremonies in Brighton Town Hall |year=2013 |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove City Council |access-date=23 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115106/http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/community-and-life-events/births-deaths-and-marriages/ceremonies-brighton-town-hall |archive-date=24 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of a British subsidiary of the United States arms company [[EDO Corporation]] on the Home Farm Industrial Estate in [[Moulsecoomb]] has been the cause of protests since 2004. The premises were significantly damaged in January 2009 when protesters broke in.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB205&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=205.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
In 1985, the Borough Council described three &quot;myths&quot; about Brighton's economy. Common beliefs were that most of the working population commuted to London every day; that tourism provided most of Brighton's jobs and income; or that the borough's residents were &quot;composed entirely of wealthy theatricals and retired businesspeople&quot; rather than workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRH51&quot;/&gt; Brighton has been an important centre for commerce and employment since the 18th century. It is home to several major companies, some of which employ thousands of people locally; as a retail centre it is of regional importance; creative, digital and new media businesses are increasingly significant; and, although Brighton was never a major industrial centre, its [[Brighton railway works|railway works]] contributed to Britain's rail industry in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly in the manufacture of steam locomotives.

Since the amalgamation of Brighton and Hove, economic and retail data has been produced at a citywide level only. Examples of statistics include: Brighton and Hove's tourism industry contributes £380m to the economy and employs 20,000 people directly or indirectly; the city has 9,600 registered companies; and a 2001 report identified it as one of five &quot;supercities for the future&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB113&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=113.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past couple of years tourists to Brighton and Hove have fallen in numbers. Over 2016, day visitors to Brighton and Hove dropped by an average of 2,400 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/business/14794028.Day_visitors_to_Brighton_and_Hove_fall_by_a_million|location=Brighton|work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]|title=Day visitors to Brighton and Hove fall by a million|date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-37619384|work=[[BBC News]]|title=Drop in day visitors to Brighton and Hove|date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, new figures for the year showed Brighton's tourism had fallen by a further 1 per cent on the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/15465791.New_figures_reveal_visitor_numbers_are_down_so_has_Brighton_lost_some_sparkle_/|work=The Argus|title=New figures reveal visitor numbers are down so has Brighton lost some sparkle?|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commerce and industry===
[[File:Brighton Centre, Kings Road, Brighton (from SE) (April 2013).JPG|thumb|left|Events at the [[Brighton Centre]] are important to Brighton's economy.]]

Brighton's largest [[private sector]] employer is [[American Express]], whose European headquarters are at John Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.theargus.co.uk/communitypages/central_brighton/news/9915514.American_Express_ready_to_move_into_new_office |work=The Argus |title=American Express ready to move into new office|date=6 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, about 3,000 people work there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.theargus.co.uk/communitypages/central_brighton/news/9915514.American_Express_ready_to_move_into_new_office |work=The Argus |title = 3,000 employees move to new Amex offices |date=6 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Planning permission]] to demolish the old Amex offices and build a replacement was granted in 2009, and work started in March 2010. Other major employers include [[Lloyds Bank]], [[Legal &amp; General]], [[Asda]] (which has hypermarkets at [[Hollingbury]] and [[Brighton Marina]]), [[Brighton &amp; Hove (bus company)|Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company]] and call-centre operator Inkfish&lt;!-- Don't wikilink this --&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB113&quot; /&gt; In 2012, it was reported that about 1,500 of [[Gatwick Airport]]'s 21,000 workers lived in the city of Brighton and Hove.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argus-11122012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10100845.Thousands_of_jobs_at_Gatwick/ |title=Thousands of jobs at Gatwick |date=11 December 2012 |work=The Argus }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brighton is a popular destination for conferences, exhibitions and trade fairs, and has had a purpose-built conference centre—the [[Brighton Centre]]—since 1977. Direct income from the Brighton Centre's 160 events per year is £8&amp;nbsp;million,{{NoteTag|2009 figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB56&quot; /&gt;}} and a further £50&amp;nbsp;million is generated indirectly by visitors spending money during their stay. Events range from political party conferences to concerts.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB56&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=56.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hollingbury Industrial Estate is one of the largest such facilities in Brighton; in its early days about 6,000 people were employed, principally in industrial jobs, but in the late 20th and early 21st centuries its focus has switched to commercial and retail development,&lt;ref name=&quot;BB-990853&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20110409.990853.htm |title = IKEA fails to get Hollingbury site |date=9 April 2011 |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Economic Partnership |accessdate=23 December 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194551/http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20110409.990853.htm |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; limiting Brighton's potential for industrial growth. Brighton Corporation laid out the estate on {{convert|18|acre|ha}} of land around Crowhurst Road in 1950. By 1956, large-scale employment was provided at a bakery, a typewriter factory and a machine tools manufacturer among others. Most of the large factories closed during the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s, employment fell to 1,000, and structural changes started in the mid-1980s with a move towards small-scale industrial units (the Enterprise Estate was finished in October 1985) and then retail warehouses. [[Asda]]'s superstore opened in November 1987, [[MFI Group|MFI]] followed two years later, and other retail units were built in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB149–150&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=149–150.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two large headquarters buildings were vacated in quick succession when British Bookshops left in March 2011&lt;ref name=&quot;BB-451248&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20110320.451248.htm |title=British Bookshops warehouse on the market |date=20 March 2011 |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Economic Partnership |access-date=23 December 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194549/http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20110320.451248.htm |archive-date = 23 September 2015 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Argus'' newspaper moved out of its headquarters in 2012—although the [[Brighton &amp; Hove (bus company)|Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company]] signed a contract to move its 1,250 employees into the latter building.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB-398183&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20120601.398183.htm |title=Hove bus garage move offers a real win-win prize |date=1 June 2012 |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Economic Partnership |accessdate=23 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809035859/http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20120601.398183.htm |archivedate=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 21st century, the market for office accommodation in the city was characterised by fluctuating demand and a lack of supply of high-quality buildings. As an example, the Trafalgar Place development ({{circa}} 1990), &quot;now considered a prime office location&quot;, stood partly empty for a decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBS-9.2.2&quot;&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/downloads/ldf/Tall_Buildings_Study_Final.pdf |title=Brighton &amp; Hove Tall Buildings Study |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove City Council (in association with Gillespies and GVA Grimley) |date=October 2003 |edition=Issue C |format=PDF |section=§. 9.2.2: Brighton Office Market |page=28 |accessdate=22 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224112141/http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/downloads/ldf/Tall_Buildings_Study_Final.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exion 27 (built in 2001), a high-tech, energy-efficient office development at [[Hollingbury]], remained empty for several years and is still not in commercial use: it houses some administrative departments of the [[University of Brighton]].

===Retail &amp; Shopping===
Brighton is well known for the great shopping, with a high number of independent shops, which add to the character of the city.

Walking from Brighton station towards the seafront, first is the [[North Laine]] area, stretching from Trafalgar Street, Kensington Gardens, Sydney Street, Gardner Street and Bond Street and is mostly pedestrianised.  The [[North Laine]] area is a retail, leisure and residential area immediately north of the Lanes. Its name derives from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Laine&quot; meaning &quot;fields&quot;, although the misnomer &quot;North Lanes&quot; is often used to describe the area. The North Laine contains a mix of businesses dominated by cafés, bars, theatres, and over 400 shops independent and avant-garde shops including an erotic shop and indoor flea markets.

[[File:The Lanes, Brighton - geograph.org.uk - 633351.jpg|thumb|[[The Lanes]] is a tourist attraction occupied by small independent shops.]]

[[The Lanes]] which is characterised by a labyrinth of narrow alleyways form a retail, leisure and residential area near the seafront, following the street pattern of the original fishing village. The Lanes contain predominantly clothing stores, jewellers, antique shops, restaurants and pubs.

[[Churchill Square (Brighton and Hove)|Churchill Square]] is a shopping centre with a floor space of {{convert|470000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} and over 80 shops, several restaurants and 1,600 car-parking spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchillsquare.co.uk/index.php?id=271|title=Churchill Square Shopping Centre: Churchill Square Food|accessdate=20 August 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204134551/http://www.churchillsquare.co.uk/index.php?id=271|archivedate=4 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in the 1960s as an open-air, multi-level pedestrianised shopping centre, but was rebuilt and enlarged in 1998 and is no longer open-air. Further retail areas include Western Road and London Road, the latter of which is currently undergoing extensive regeneration in the form of new housing and commercial properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/major-projects-planning/london-road-regeneration|title = London Road Regeneration|website = Brighton and Hove City Council|publisher = Brighton and Hove City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable for its [[Indo-Saracenic]] architecture and Oriental interior. Other Indo-Saracenic buildings in Brighton include the [[Sassoon Mausoleum]], now, with the bodies reburied elsewhere, in use as a chic supper club.

[[Brighton Palace Pier|Brighton Marine Palace and Pier]] (long known as the Palace Pier) opened in 1899; it features a [[funfair]], restaurants and arcade halls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to Brighton Palace Pier |url=http://www.brightonpier.co.uk |publisher=Brighton Pier |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[West Pier]] was built in 1866 and is one of only two Grade I listed piers in the United Kingdom; it has been closed since 1975. For some time it was under consideration for restoration, but two fires in 2003, and other setbacks, led to these plans being abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwidewet.net/ |title=Pier Threatens To Unplug Rival|publisher=Worldwidewet.net |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, publicity material presented in question-and-answer form during the building of the [[British Airways i360]] observation tower (see below) maintained that the building of the tower would not prove prejudicial to the eventual restoration of the pier.

The observation tower, located at the shore end of the West Pier, opened on 4 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/04/residents-say-brighton-sea-views-ruined-by-eyesore-i360-tower-se/|title=Residents say Brighton sea views 'ruined' by 'eyesore' i360 tower set to open today|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Helena|last=Horton|date=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 162 metres (531.49 feet) high, and with an observation pod rising to 138 metres (452.75 feet), the i360 is Britain's highest observation tower outside London – taller even than the [[London Eye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How tall is British Airways i360? |url=http://britishairwaysi360.com/latest-news/faqs/tall-british-airways-i360/ |publisher=British Airways i360 |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
Around 1500&amp;nbsp;BC a tribe called the [[Oenotrians|Oenotri]] (&quot;vine-cultivators&quot;), settled in the region. According to [[Greek mythology]], they were [[Greeks]] who were led to the region by their king, [[Oenotrus]]. They were more likely an [[Oscan language|Oscan-speaking]] tribe. The Greeks used the term 'italoi', which according to some ancient Greek writers was derived from a legendary king of the Oenotri, [[Italus]] and according to others from the bull. Originally the Greeks used 'italoi' to indicate Calabrians and later it became synonymous with the rest of the peninsula. Calabria therefore was the first region to be called Italia (Italy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5szMbqDSWg|title=italian travel team Calabria – Italy Travel Guide|last=Antonio Luce|date=25 January 2011|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dantemass.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dantemass.org/html/concise-history-of-italy.html|title=Dante Alighieri Society of Massachusetts: A Concise History of Italy|first=Dante Alighieri Society of Massachusetts|last=Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/cir%C3%B2-wine-calabria-toe-boot-southern-italy|title=Cirò: Calabria's Ancient Wine from the Toe of Southern Italy's Boot – Into Wine|date=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consiglioregionale.calabria.it/hp4/pubblicazioni/GuidaConsiglio_En.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=264353|title=Review of Calabria: The First Italy|first=Cornelia C.|last=Coulter|date=1 January 1942|journal=Classical Philology|volume=37|issue=2|pages=223–225|doi=10.1086/362608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eighth and seventh centuries BC, Greek settlers founded many colonies (settlements) on the coast of southern Italy ([[Magna Graecia|Magna Grecia]]). In Calabria they founded Chone ([[Pallagorio]]), Cosentia ([[Cosenza]]), Clampetia ([[Amantea]]), [[Scyllaeum]] ([[Scilla]]), [[Sybaris]] ([[Sibari]]), [[Hipponion]] ([[Vibo Valentia]]), [[Locri Epizefiri]] ([[Locri]]), [[Kaulon]] ([[Monasterace]]), [[Krimisa]] ([[Cirò Marina]]), [[Crotone|Kroton]] ([[Crotone]]), [[Laüs]] (comune of [[Santa Maria del Cedro]]), [[Medma]] ([[Rosarno]]), [[Metauros]] ([[Gioia Tauro]]), [[Petelia]] ([[Strongoli]]), [[Rhegion|Rhégion]] ([[Reggio Calabria]]), [[Scylletium]] ([[Borgia, Calabria|Borgia]]), [[Temesa (ancient city)|Temesa]] ([[Campora San Giovanni]]), [[Terina (ancient city)|Terina]] ([[Nocera Terinese]]), [[Pandosia (Bruttium)|Pandosia]] ([[Acri]]) and [[Thurii]], (Thurio, comune of [[Corigliano Calabro]]).

Rhegion was the birthplace of one of the famed [[nine lyric poets]], [[Ibycus]]. Metauros was the birthplace of another of the [[nine lyric poets]], [[Stesichorus]], who was the first lyric poet of the western world. Kroton spawned many victors during the ancient Olympics and other Panhellenic Games. Amongst the most famous were [[Milo of Croton]], who won six wrestling events in six Olympics in a row, along with seven events in the Pythian Games, nine events in the Nemean Games and ten events in the Isthmian Games and also [[Astylos of Croton]], who won six running events in three Olympics in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/content/olympic-games/ancient-olympic-games/the-athlete/|title=Olympic Games – Winter Summer Past and Future Olympics|date=20 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[Alcmaeon of Croton]] (a philosopher and medical theorist) and [[Pythagoras]] (a mathematician and philosopher), who moved to Kroton in 530 BC, the city became a renowned center of philosophy, science and medicine.

The Itali were the first established people of Calabria. Later came the Bruttii from Lucania. These occupied Calabria and called it Bruttium. The Bruttii were very advanced culturally. The Greek cities of Calabria came under the pressure from these [[Lucanians]], an [[Oscan]] people who lived in the present day region of [[Basilicata]]. They conquered the north of Calabria and pushed further south, taking over part of the interior, probably after they defeated the Thurians near Laus in 390 BC. A few decades later Calabria came under pressure from the [[Bruttii]]. They were Lucanian slaves and other fugitives who were seeking refuge on the steep mountains of Calabria. Their name was Lucanian and meant rebels. They took advantage of the weakening of the Greek cites caused by wars between them. They took over Hipponium, Terina and Thurii. They helped the Lucanians to fight [[Alexander I of Epirus|Alexander of Epirus]] (334–32 BC), who had come to the aid of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (in [[Apulia]]), which was also pressured by the Lucanians. After this, [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] ravaged the coast of Calabria with his fleet, took Hipponium and forced the Bruttii into unfavourable peace terms. However, they soon seized Hipponium again. After Agathloces' death in 289 BC the Lucanians and Bruttii pushed into the territory of Thurii and ravaged it. The city sent envoys to Rome to ask for help in 285 BC  and 282 BC. On the second occasion, the Romans sent forces to garrison the city. This was part of the episode which sparked the Pyrrhic war.

During the Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC) the Lucanians and Bruttii sided with Pyrrhus and provided contingents which fought with his army. When Pyrrhus landed in Italy the people of Rhegion were worried about their safety and asked Rome for protection. The Romans sent soldiers from [[Campania]] to garrison the city. Coveting the wealth of the city, the soldiers killed its prominent men, sent away the rest and seized their property. The Romans could not do much about it because they were engaged in the war. A few years after the end of the war, in 271 BC, the Romans retook the city, arrested the soldiers and took them to Rome, where they were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, The Histories, 1.7–10&lt;/ref&gt; After Pyrrhus was defeated, to avoid Roman revenge, the Bruttii submitted willingly and gave up half of the Sila, a mountainous plateau which was valuable for its pitch and timber. The timber here was sold all over Italy and the resin of the area was of the highest quality.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Histories, 20.5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) the Bruttii allied with [[Hannibal]], who sent [[Hanno, son of Bomilcar|Hanno]], one of his commanders, to Calabria. Hanno marched towards [[Capua]] (in Campania) with Bruttian soldiers to take them to Hannibal's headquarters there twice, but he was defeated on both occasions. When his campaign in Italy came to a dead end, Hannibal took refuge in Calabria, whose steep mountains provided protection against the Roman legions. He set up his headquarters in Kroton and stayed there for four years until he was recalled to Carthage. The Romans fought a battle with him near Kroton, but its details are unknown. Many Calabrian cities surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, The History of Rome, 30.19&lt;/ref&gt; Calabria was put under a military commander. Nearly a decade after the war, the Romans set up colonies in Calabria: at Tempsa and Kroton (Croto in Latin) in 194 BC, Copiae in the territory of Thurii (Thurium in Latin) in 193 BC, and Vibo Valentia in the territory of Hipponion in 192 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, The History of Rome, 34.45, 53; 35.40&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans called Calabria Bruttium. Later, during the reign of Augustus it became part of the third region of Italy, the 'Regio III Lucania et Brettium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWVQOcpVuZoC|title=The Etruscans Outside Etruria|first1=Paolo|last1=Bernardini|first2=Giovannangelo|last2=Camporeale|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-0-89236-767-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
After sacking Rome in 410, Alaric I (King of the Visigoths) went to Calabria with the intention of sailing to Africa. He contracted malaria and died in Cosentia ([[Cosenza]]), probably of fever. Legend has it that he along with the treasure of Rome were buried under the bed of the River Busento.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Durschmied, From Armageddon to the Fall of Rome, Ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall of the western part of the Roman Empire in 476, Italy was taken over by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer and later became part of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in 489. The Ostrogothic kings ruled officially as Magistri Militum of the Byzantine Emperors and all government and administrative positions were held by the Romans while all primary laws were legislated by the Byzantine Emperor. Therefore, during the sixth century, under the Ostrogoths' rule, Romans could still be at the center of government and cultural life, such as the Roman [[Cassiodorus]] who, like Boethius and Symmachus, emerged as one of the most prominent men of his time. He was an administrator, politician, scholar and historian who was born in Scylletium (near Catanzaro). He spent most of his career trying to bridge the divides of East and West, Greek and Latin cultures, Romans and Goths, and official Christianity and [[Arian Christianity]], which was the form of Christianity of the Ostrogoths and which had earlier been banned. He set up his [[Vivarium (monastery)]] in Scylletium. He oversaw the collation of three editions of the Bible in Latin. Seeing the practicality of uniting all the books of the Bible in one volume, he was the first who produced Latin Bibles in single volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brown, The World of Late Antiquity: AD 150–750.&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known of them was the [[Codex Grandior]] which was the ancestor of all modern western Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xn8i8cLNDM|title=Testament The Bible And History episode 6 Power And Glory part one (1 of 2)|last=TheGreatMysteries|date=3 April 2011|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=204|title=The Scriptorium and Library at the Vivarium : HistoryofInformation.com|website=www.historyofinformation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;faculty.georgetown.edu&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap6.html|title=Cassiodorus, Chapter 6: Vivarium|website=faculty.georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassiodorus was at the heart of the administration of the Ostrogothic kingdom. Theodoric made him quaestor sacri palatii (quaestor of the sacred palace, the senior legal authority) in 507, governor of Lucania and Bruttium, consul in 514 and magister officiorum (master of offices, one of the most senior administrative officials) in 523. He was praetorian prefect (chief minister) under the successors of Theodoric: under Athalaric (Theodoric's grandson, reigned 526–34) in 533 and, between 535 and 537, under Theodahad (Theodoric's nephew, reigned 534–36) and Witiges (Theodoric's grandson-in-law, reigned, 536–40).&lt;ref&gt;Cassiodorus, Variae, 9.24–54, 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; The major works of Cassiodorus, besides the mentioned bibles, were the Historia Gothorum, a history of the Goths, the Variae and account of his administrative career and the Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum, an introduction to the study of the sacred scriptures and the liberal arts which was very influential in the Middle Ages.

[[Byzantine]] (Eastern Roman) Emperor Justinian I, retook Italy from the Ostrogoths between 535 and 556. They soon lost much of Italy to the [[Lombards]] between 568 and 590, but retained the south for around 500 years until 1059–1071, where they thrived and where the Greek language was the official and vernacular language. In Calabria and towns such as [[Stilo]] and [[Rossano]] and [[San Demetrio Corone]] achieved great religious status.  From the 7th Century many monasteries were built in the Amendolea and Stilaro Valleys and Stilo was the destination of hermits and Basilian monks.  Many Byzantine churches are still seen in the region. The 10th-century church in Rossano ,togheter with the &quot;twin&quot; church of Sant'Adriano in San Demetrio Corone (foundation 955 ,rebuilt by the [[Normans]] on the ,still, visible foundations of the previous Byzantine church), are considered between the best preserved Byzantine churches in Italy. They were both built by St. [[Nilus the Younger]] as a retreat for the monks who lived in the tufa grottos underneath.  The present name of Calabria comes from the duchy of Calabria.

Around the year 800, [[Saracen]]s began invading the shores of Calabria, attempting to wrest control of the area from the Byzantines.  This group of Arabs had already been successful [[Emirate of Sicily|in Sicily]] and knew that Calabria was another key spot. The people of Calabria retreated into the mountains for safety. Although the Arabs never really got a stronghold on the whole of Calabria, they did control some villages while enhancing trade relations with the eastern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;bleedingespresso.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleedingespresso.com/calabria/history-of-calabria|title=Bleeding Espresso|author=metatags generator|publisher=bleedingespresso.com|access-date=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 918, Saracens captured [[Reggio di Calabria|Reggio]] (which was renamed ''Rivà''), holding many of its inhabitants to ransom or keeping them prisoners as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''The Italian Cities and the Arabs before 1095'', Hilmar C. Krueger, '''A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years''', Vol. I, ed. Kenneth Meyer Setton, Marshall W. Baldwin, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1955), 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; It is during this time of Arab invasions that many staples of today's Calabrian cuisine came into fashion: [[Citrus|citrus fruits]] and [[eggplant]]s for example. Exotic spices such as cloves and nutmeg were also introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Under the Byzantine dominion, between the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 10th century, Calabria was one of the first regions of Italy to introduce [[silk]] production to Europe.
According to André Guillou,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | language=it|first=André | last=Guillou | first2=Paolo| last2=Delogu |title=Storia d'Italia | volume=III| chapter=Il mezzoggiorno dai Bizantini a Federico II | year=1983 | publisher=UTET}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morus (plant)|mulberry trees]] for the production of raw silk were introduced to southern Italy by the Byzantines at the end of the ninth century.
Around 1050 the theme of Calabria had 24,000, mulberry trees cultivated for their foliage, and their number tended to expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sakellariou |first1=Eleni |title=Southern Italy in the Late Middle Ages: Demographic, Institutional Change in the Kingdom of Naples, c.1440-c.1530 |date=2011 |publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the cultivation of [[mulberry]] was moving first steps in [[Northern Italy]], silk made in Calabria reached the peak of 50% of the whole Italian/European production. As the cultivation of mulberry was difficult in Northern and Continental Europe, merchants and operators used to purchase in Calabria raw materials in order to finish the products and resell them for a better price. The Genoese silk artisans used fine Calabrian silk for the production of velvets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Sakellariou |first1=Eleni |title=Southern Italy in the Late Middle Ages: Demographic, Institutional Change in the Kingdom of Naples, c.1440-c.1530 |date=2011 |publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, the silk of [[Catanzaro]] supplied almost all of Europe and was sold in a large market fair to [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Venice|Venetian]], [[Genoa|Genoese]], [[Florence|Florentine]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchants.
Catanzaro became the lace capital of Europe with a large silkworm breeding facility that produced all the laces and linens used in the [[Vatican city|Vatican]]. The city was famous for its fine fabrication of silks, velvets, damasks and brocades.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.madeinitalyfor.me/en/info/lantica-e-nobile-arte-serica/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Catanzaro-Italy&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1060s the [[Normans]] from their duchy in France, under the leadership of [[Robert Guiscard]]'s brother, [[Roger I of Sicily]], established a presence in this [[Marches|borderland]], and organized a government modeled on the Eastern Roman Empire and was run by the local magnates of Calabria. Of note is that the Normans established their presence here, in southern Italy (namely Calabria), 6 years prior to their conquest of England, (see [[The Battle of Hastings]]).  The purpose of this strategic presence in Calabria was to lay the foundations for the Crusades 30 years later, and for the creation of two Kingdoms: the Kingship of Jerusalem, and the Kingdom of Sicily.  Ships would sail from Calabria to the Holy Land. This made Calabria one of the richest regions in Europe as princes from the noble families of England, France and other regions, constructed secondary residences and palaces here, on their way to the Holy Land. Guiscard's son [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]], who was born in [[San Marco Argentano]], would be one of the leaders in the first crusade. Of particular note is the [[Via Francigena]], an ancient pilgrim route that goes from Canterbury to Rome and southern Italy, reaching Calabria, Basilicata and Apulia, where the crusaders lived, prayed and trained, respectively.

At the beginning of the tenth century (circa 903),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.initalytoday.com/calabria/catanzaro/ |title=Catanzaro Italy: Catanzaro guide, city of Catanzaro, Calabria Italy |publisher=Initalytoday.com |access-date=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923122332/http://www.initalytoday.com/calabria/catanzaro/ |archive-date=23 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; the city of Catanzaro was occupied by the Muslim [[Saracens]], who founded an [[emirate]] and took the Arab name of قطنصار – QaTanSáar. An Arab presence is evidenced by findings at an eighth-century necropolis which had items with Arabic inscriptions.
Around the year 1050, Catanzaro rebelled against Saracen dominance and returned to a brief period of Byzantine control.&lt;ref&gt;https://viaggiart.com/en/catanzaro&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1098, [[Roger I of Sicily]] was named the equivalent of an apostolic legate by Pope [[Urban II]] and later his son [[Roger II of Sicily]] became the first [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]] and formed what would become the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] which lasted nearly 700 years. Under the Normans Southern Italy was united as one region and started a feudal system of land ownership in which the Normans were made lords of the land while peasants performed all the work on the land.

In 1147, Roger II of Sicily attacked [[Corinth]] and [[Thebes]], two important centres of Byzantine silk production, capturing the weavers and their equipment and establishing his own silkworks in Calabria,&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;&gt;Muthesius, Anna, &quot;Silk in the Medieval World&quot;. In Jenkins (2003), p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby causing the Norman silk industry to flourish.

In 1194 the Swabians took control under [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. He created a kingdom that blended cultures, philosophy and customs and would build several castles while fortifying existing ones which the Normans previously constructed. After the death of Frederick II in 1250, Calabria was controlled by the French once more, the Angevins, under the rule of [[Charles I of Naples|Charles d’Anjou]] after being granted the crown by Pope Clement IV. Under Charles d’Anjou the Kingdom of Sicily was changed to the [[Kingdom of Naples]] in 1282 after he lost Sicily due to the rebellion of the [[Sicilian Vespers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; During the 14th century, would emerge [[Barlaam of Seminara]] who would be [[Petrarch]]'s Greek teacher and his disciple [[Leonzio Pilato]], who would translate Homer's works for [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].

===Early modern period===
In 1442 the Aragonese took control under [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] who became ruler under the [[Crown of Aragon]]. In 1501 Calabria came under the control of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] who is famed for sponsoring the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492. Calabria suffered greatly under Aragonese rule with heavy taxes, feuding landlords, starvation and sickness. After a brief period in the early 1700s under the Austrian Habsburgs, Calabria came into the control of the Spanish Bourbons in 1735.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; It was during the 16th century that Calabria would contribute to modern world history with the creation of the [[Gregorian calendar]] by the Calabrian doctor and astronomer [[Luigi Lilio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/gregorian-calendar.html|title=The Gregorian Calendar|website=www.timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sussexvt.k12.de.us/science/The%20History%20of%20the%20World%201500-1899/Gregorian%20Calendar%20Adopted.htm|title=Gregorian Calendar Adopted}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naplesldm.com/lillo.html|title=Luigi Lillo, the Gregorian Calendat &amp; the Carafa Castle|first=Jeff|last=Matthews|access-date=6 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401173802/http://www.naplesldm.com/lillo.html|archive-date=1 April 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1466, King [[Louis XI]] decided to develop a national silk industry in [[Lyon]] and called a large number of Italian workers, mainly from Calabria. The fame of the master weavers of Catanzaro spread throughout [[France]] and they were invited to Lyon in order to teach the techniques of weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rossi |first1=Cesare |last2=Russo |first2=Flavio |date=2016 |title= Ancient Engineers' Inventions: Precursors of the Present}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1470, one of these weavers, known in France as Jean Le Calabrais, invented the first prototype of a [[Jacquard machine|Jacquard]]-type loom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=it |last=Rubino |first=Angela |date=2006 |title=La seta a Catanzaro e Lione.

Over the years, improvements to the loom were ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.handweaving.net/DigitalArchive/books/wp_Chapter_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] formally recognized the growth of the silk industry of [[Catanzaro]] in 1519 by allowing the city to establish a consulate of the silk craft, charged with regulating and check in the various stages of a production that flourished throughout the sixteenth century. At the moment of the creation of its guild, the city declared that it had over 500 [[loom]]s. By 1660, when the town had about 16,000 inhabitants, its silk industry kept 1,000 looms, and at least 5,000 people, busy. The silk textiles of [[Catanzaro]] were not only sold at the [[Kingdom of Naples|kingdom]]'s markets, they were also exported to Venice, [[France]], Spain and [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sakellariou |first1=Eleni |title=Southern Italy in the Late Middle Ages: Demographic, Institutional Change in the Kingdom of Naples, c.1440-c.1530 |date=2011 |publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, Calabria was characterized by a strong demographical and economic development, mainly due to the increasing demand of silk products and the simultaneous growth of prices, and became one of the most important Mediterranean markets for silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Galasso |first1=Giuseppe |title=Economia e società nella Calabria del Cinquecento|language=it|date=1975 |publisher=L'Altra Europa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century silk production in Calabria begin to suffer by the strong competition of new-raising competitors in Italian Peninsula and Europe (France), but also the increasing import from Ottoman Empire and Persia.

At the end of the 18th century the French took control and in 1808 Napoleon Bonaparte gave the Kingdom of Naples to his brother-in-law [[Joachim Murat]]. Murat controlled the kingdom until the return of the Bourbons in 1815. The population of Calabria in 1844 was 1,074,558.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.IV'', (1848) London, Charles Knight, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

Calabria experienced a series of peasant revolts as part of the European [[Revolutions of 1848]]. This set the stage for the eventual unification with the rest of Italy in 1861, when the [[Kingdom of Naples]] was brought into the union by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. The unification was orchestrated by Great Britain in an attempt to nationalize the production of sulfur from the two volcanoes located in Naples and Sicily respectively.  The [[Aspromonte]] was the scene of a famous battle of the unification of Italy. During the late 19th or early 20th century, pianist and composer [[Alfonso Rendano]] invented the &quot;Third Pedal&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://susanvanallen.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/golden-day-107-cosenza-with-lulu-bianco-of-calabrisella-mia/|title=Golden Day 107: Cosenza with LuLu Bianco of Calabrisella Mia|date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which augmented the interpretative resources of the piano.

The ancient Greek colonies from Naples and to the south, had been completely [[Latinization (historical)|Latinized]], but from the fifth century AD onward Greeks had once again emigrated there when pressed out of their homeland by invasions. This Greek Diaspora allowed the ancient Greek dialects to continue in Southern Italy, much in the same way that the Italian Diaspora allowed long-lost dialects from Italy to thrive in countries where Italians emigrated to. Greek texts were also valued in monasteries and places of learning.  However it was [[Charlemagne]] in the 8th century, who made Latin the 'official' language of study and communication for Europe.   For the sake of uniformity, he supplanted much of the Greek spoken, read or taught in Europe. It was through language (Latin) and education (Latin texts) that Charlemagne united Europe.

During the 13th century a French chronicler who traveled through Calabria stated that &quot;the peasants of Calabria spoke nothing but Greek&quot; given he had traveled to areas where Greek was still available.  But the educated classes spoke Italian. Indeed, formal Italian has been taught in schools throughout Italy for nearly two centuries, causing the ancient languages and dialects to continually disappear, much to the chagrin of the cultural community. These lost dialects continue to thrive to this day in North America and Australia, places where Italians emigrated to, on account of the [[Diaspora]].

===Modern era===
On 19 August 1860, Calabria was invaded from Sicily by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and his Redshirts as part of the [[Expedition of the Thousand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norwich |first1=John Julius |title=The Middle Sea: A History of the Mediterranean |date=2007 |publisher=Alfred Knopf |location=New York |isbn=0307387720 |page=xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through King Francesco II of Naples had dispatched 16,000 soldiers to stop the Redshirts, who numbered about 3,500, after a token battle at Reggio Calabria won by the Redshirts, all resistance ceased and Garibaldi was welcomed as a liberator from the oppressive rule of the Bourbons whatever he went in Calabria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norwich |first1=John Julius |title=The Middle Sea: A History of the Mediterranean |date=2007 |publisher=Alfred Knopf |location=New York |isbn=0307387720 |page=xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calabria together with the rest of the Kingdom of Naples was incorporated in 1861 into the Kingdom of Italy. Garibaldi planned to complete the ''Risorgimento'' by invading Rome, still ruled by the Pope protected by a French garrison, and began with semi-official encouragement to raise an army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/12 12-13] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, King Victor Emmanuel II decided the possibility of war with France was too dangerous, and on 29 August 1862 Garibaldi's base in the Calabrian town of [[Aspromonte]] was attacked by the ''Regio Esercito''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/14 14] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Aspromonte]] ended with the Redshirts defeated with several being executed after surrendering while Garibaldi was badly wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/14 14] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

In the newly unified Kingdom of Italy, there were significant differences in level of economic development between the ''Nord'' (north) of Italy and the ''Mezzogiorno''  (the south of Italy). Many Italian academics from the north, such as the Piedmontese anthropologist [[Cesare Lombroso]], explained this difference in racial terms. In his 1876 book ''L'uomo delinquente'' (&quot;The criminal man&quot;), Lombroso argued that the people from the north were part of the &quot;Nordic&quot; race while people from ''Mezzogiorno'' were a &quot;Mediterranean&quot; race, citing the high murder rates in Calabria, Sicily and Sardinia as evidence that the people from the south were descended from &quot;inferior&quot; races.&lt;ref name=&quot;DelLago&quot; /&gt; In 1884, Lombroso appeared as an expert witness at the court-martial of a soldier from Calabria who had gone on a rampage and killed eight  of his fellow soldiers. Lombroso testified that the rampage was due to the fact that Calabrians were innately violent and criminal due to racial reasons, a point elaborated upon in his 1898 essay ''In Calabria'', where he argued that it was the &quot;Mediterranean&quot; racial character of Calabrians that determined their behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;DelLago&quot; &gt;{{cite book |last=Del Lago |first=Enrico |editor-last1=Healy |editor-first1=R. |editor-last2=Del Lago |editor-first2=Enrico |title=The Shadow of Colonialism on Europe’s Modern Past |series=Cambridge Imperial and Post-Colonial Studies Series |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |date=2014 |pages=57–72 |chapter=Italian National Unification and the Mezzogiorno: Colonialism in One Country? |isbn=978-1-137-45075-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calabria together with the rest of the ''Mezzogiorno'' was neglected under the Kingdom of Italy with the general feeling in Rome being that the region was hopelessly backward and poor. In the late 19th century about 70% of the population of the ''Mezzogiorno'' were illiterate as the government never seemed to have the money to build schools or hire teachers for the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/165 165] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack }}&lt;/ref&gt; Owning to the [[Roman Question]], until 1903 the Roman Catholic Church had prohibited on the pain of excommunication Catholic men from voting in Italian elections (Italian women were not granted the right to vote until 1946).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/165 165-166] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the devoutly Catholic population of Calabria tended to boycott elections, the deputies who were elected from the region were the products of the clientistic system, representing the interests of the land-owning aristocracy.

On 28 December 1908, Calabria together with Sicily was devastated by an [[1908 Messina earthquake|earthquake and then by a tsunami]] caused by the earthquake, causing about 80, 000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/181 181] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within hours of the disaster, ships of the British and Russian navies had arrived on the coast to assist the survivors, but it took the ''Regia Marina'' two days to send a relief expedition from Naples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/181 181] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bumbling and ineffectual response of the Italian authorities to the disaster caused by feuding officials who did not wish to co-operate with each other contributed to the high death toll as it took weeks for aid to reach some villages and caused much resentment in Calabria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/181 181] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack }}&lt;/ref&gt; To offset widespread criticism that the northern-dominated government in Rome did not care about the people of Calabria, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] personally took over the relief operation and toured the destroyed villages of Calabria, which won the House of Savoy a measure of popularity in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/181 181-182] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, after the king took charge of the relief efforts, the feuding between officials ceased and relief aid was delivered with considerably more efficiency, winning Victor Emmanuel the gratitude of the Calabrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/181 181-182] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Fascism was not popular in Calabria. In December 1924 when a false rumor spread in [[Reggio Calabria]] that [[Benito Mussolini]] had resigned as Prime Minister because of the Matteotti affair, joyous celebrations took place in the city that lasted all night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/260 260-261] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the morning, the people of Reggio Calabria learned that Mussolini was still prime minister, but several Fascist officials were dismissed for not suppressing the celebrations.

Under the First Republic, starting in the 1960s, investment plans were launched under which Italian state sponsored industrialisation and attempted to improve the infrastructure of Calabria by building modern roads, railroads, ports, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sergi, |first1=Anna |last2=Lavorgna |first2=Anita |title='Ndrangheta: The Glocal Dimensions of the Most Powerful Italian Mafia |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |isbn=331932585X |pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was a notable failure with the infrastructure projects going wildly over-budget and taking far longer to complete then scheduled; for an example, construction started on the A3 highway in 1964 intended to link Reggio Calabria to Salerno, which was as of 2016 still unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sergi, |first1=Anna |last2=Lavorgna |first2=Anita |title='Ndrangheta: The Glocal Dimensions of the Most Powerful Italian Mafia |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |isbn=331932585X |pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to complete the A3 highway after 52 years of effort is regarded as a scandal in Italy, and many parts of Calabria were described as an &quot;industrial graveyard&quot; full of the closed down steel mills and chemical plants that all went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sergi, |first1=Anna |last2=Lavorgna |first2=Anita |title='Ndrangheta: The Glocal Dimensions of the Most Powerful Italian Mafia |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |isbn=331932585X |pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; From July 1970 to February 1971 the [[Reggio revolt]] took place as the decision to make Catanzaro instead of Reggio the regional capital prompted massive protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sergi, |first1=Anna |last2=Lavorgna |first2=Anita |title='Ndrangheta: The Glocal Dimensions of the Most Powerful Italian Mafia |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |isbn=331932585X |pages=15-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compromise decision to make Catanzaro the executive capital and Reggio the administrative capital has led to a bloated and inefficient administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sergi, |first1=Anna |last2=Lavorgna |first2=Anita |title='Ndrangheta: The Glocal Dimensions of the Most Powerful Italian Mafia |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |isbn=331932585X |pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high unemployment rate in Calabria has led to extensive migration and Calabria's biggest export has been its own people as Calabrians have moved to either other parts of Italy and abroad, especially to the United States, Canada and Argentina, to seek a better life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sergi, |first1=Anna |last2=Lavorgna |first2=Anita |title='Ndrangheta: The Glocal Dimensions of the Most Powerful Italian Mafia |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |isbn=331932585X |pages=54-55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was estimated that 18% of the people born in Calabria were living abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sergi, |first1=Anna |last2=Lavorgna |first2=Anita |title='Ndrangheta: The Glocal Dimensions of the Most Powerful Italian Mafia |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |isbn=331932585X |pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Economy ==
Calabria enjoys a diversified economy comparable to western nations in various categories, as shown in these statistics: the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Calabria is subdivided as follows: service industry (28.94%), financial activities and real estate (21.09%), trade, tourism, transportation and communication (19.39%), taxation (11.49%), manufacturing (8.77%), construction (6.19%) and agriculture (4.13%). 
Calabria’s economy is still based mainly on agriculture.

The economy of the region is strongly affected by the presence of the [['Ndrangheta]] (the local [[Mafia]] syndicate).&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorktimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/world/europe/in-italy-calabria-is-drained-by-corruption.html |title=In Italy, Calabria is drained by corruption |newspaper=New York Times|access-date=28 May 2017|date=7 October 2012 |last1=Donadio |first1=Rachel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manufacturing ===
Food and textile industries are the most developed and vibrant. Within the industrial sector, manufacturing contributes to a gross value added of 7.2%. In the manufacturing sector the main branches are foodstuff, beverage and tobacco with a contribution to the sector very close to the national average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;/&gt;
Over the recent decades some petrochemical, engineering and chemical industries have emerged, within the areas of [[Crotone]], [[Vibo Valentia]] and [[Reggio Calabria]].

=== Tourism ===

Calabria attracts year-round tourism, offering both summer and winter activities, in addition to its cultural, historical, artistic heritage, it has an abundance of protected natural habitats and 'green' zones.  The {{convert|485|mi|abbr=off}} of its coast make Calabria a tourist destination during the summer. The low industrial development and the lack of major cities in much of its territory have allowed the maintenance of indigenous marine life.

The most sought-after seaside destinations are: [[Tropea]], [[Pizzo, Calabria|Pizzo Calabro]], [[Capo Vaticano]], [[Reggio Calabria]], [[Soverato]], [[Scilla, Calabria|Scilla]], [[Scalea]], [[Sellia Marina]], [[Montepaone]], [[Montauro]], Copanello (comune of [[Staletti]]), [[Palmi, Calabria|Tonnara di Palmi]], [[Diamante, Calabria|Diamante]], [[Paola, Calabria|Paola]], [[Fiumefreddo Bruzio]], [[Amantea]], [[Praia a Mare]], [[Belvedere Marittimo]], [[Roseto Capo Spulico]], [[Corigliano Calabro]], [[Cirò Marina]], [[Amendolara]], [[Roccella Ionica]], [[Bagnara Calabra]], [[Nicotera]], [[Cariati]], [[Zambrone]], [[Isola di Capo Rizzuto]], Caminia (comune of [[Staletti]]), [[Siderno]], [[Parghelia]], [[Ricadi]] and [[San Nicola Arcella]].

In addition to the coastal tourist destinations, the interior of Calabria is rich in history, traditions, art and culture. Cosenza is among the most important cultural cities of Calabria, with a rich historical and artistic patrimony. Medieval castles, towers, churches, monasteries and other French castles and structures from the Norman to the Aragonese periods are common elements in both the interior and coastline of Calabria.

The mountains offer skiing and other winter activities: [[Sila National Park|Sila]], [[Pollino National Park|Pollino]] and [[Aspromonte]] are three national parks that offer facilities for winter sports, especially in the towns of Camigliatello (comune of [[Spezzano della Sila]]), Lorica (comune of [[San Giovanni in Fiore]]), [[Gambarie]] and Monte Sant'Elia (comune of [[Palmi, Calabria|Palmi]]).

=== Agriculture ===

The [[Bergamot orange]] has been intensively cultivated since the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/storiadireggiod00bolagoog|title=Storia di Reggio di Calabria da'tempi primitivi sino all'anno di Cristo 1797|publisher=Stamp. del Fibreno|page=[https://archive.org/details/storiadireggiod00bolagoog/page/n320 297]|year=1857|last1=Bolani |first1=Domenico Spano }}&lt;/ref&gt; but only in the coastal area nearby to [[Reggio di Calabria|Reggio]], where geological and weather conditions are optimal. 

Calabria is also the largest producer of [[Boletus edulis|Porcini Mushrooms]] in Italy, thanks to the heavily wooded forests of the mountains ranges of [[Pollino]], [[Sila]], [[Serre calabresi|Serre]] and [[Aspromonte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://globalepicurean.com/locations/calabria |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920024346/http://globalepicurean.com/locations/calabria/ |archive-date=20 September 2015 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeinsouthitalytoday.com/from-the-tyrrhenian-to-the-ionian.php|title=Calabria itineraries from the Tyrrhenian to the Ionian|website=www.madeinsouthitalytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

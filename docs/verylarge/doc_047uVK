===REM versus non-REM sleep dreaming===
Distinct types of dreams have been identified for [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] and [[non-REM]] sleep stages. The vivid bizarre dreams that are commonly remembered upon waking up are primarily associated with REM sleep. Deep (stage 3 and 4) [[slow-wave sleep]] ([[NREM sleep]]) is commonly associated with more static, thoughtful dreams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dement1957&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dement|first1=W.|last2=Kleitman|first2=N.|year=1957|title=The Relation of Eye Movements during Sleep to Dream Activity|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=53|issue=5|pages=339–346|citeseerx=10.1.1.308.6874|doi=10.1037/h0048189|pmid=13428941}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dreams are primarily driven by the [[hippocampus]] in the process of long-term [[memory consolidation]] and predominantly include memories of events “as they happened” without the random novel combination of objects seen in REM sleep dreams. The rest of the article focuses on REM sleep dreaming, thereafter simply referred as dreaming.

===REM sleep===

[[File:Sleep EEG REM.png|thumb|left|[[Electroencephalography|EEG]] showing [[brainwaves]] during REM sleep]]

Since waking up usually happens during [[rapid eye movement sleep]] (REM), the vivid bizarre REM sleep dreams are the most common type of dreams that is remembered. (During REM sleep an [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) shows brain activity that, among sleep states, is most like wakefulness.) During a typical lifespan, a person spends a total of about six years dreaming&lt;ref name=&quot;HSWDream&quot;&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |title=How Dream Works |author=Lee Ann Obringer|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/dream3.htm |access-date=May 4, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418032147/http://science.howstuffworks.com/dream3.htm |archive-date=April 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which is about two hours each night).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |title=Brain Basics: Understanding Sleep |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/understanding_sleep.htm |access-date=December 16, 2007 |publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011011207/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/understanding_sleep.htm |archive-date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most dreams only last 5 to 20 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSWDream&quot; /&gt; It is unknown where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple portions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.

During REM sleep, the release of the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[norepinephrine]], [[serotonin]] and [[histamine]] is completely suppressed.&lt;ref name=Hobson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hobson | first1 = J.A. | year = 2009 | title = REM sleep and dreaming: towards a theory of protoconsciousness | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 11| pages = 803–813 | doi=10.1038/nrn2716 | pmid=19794431| s2cid = 205505278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aston-Jones G., Gonzalez M., &amp; Doran S.

During most dreams, the person dreaming is not aware that they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or eccentric the dream is. The reason for this may be that the [[prefrontal cortex]], the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows the dreamer to more actively interact with the dream without thinking about what might happen, since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Trimble, M.R. (1989). ''The Prefrontal Cortex: Anatomy, Physiology and Neuropsychology of the Frontal Lobe''. ''British Journal of Psychiatry''&lt;/ref&gt;

When REM sleep episodes were timed for their duration and subjects were awakened to make reports before major editing or forgetting of their dreams could take place, subjects accurately reported the length of time they had been dreaming in an REM sleep state. Some researchers have speculated that &quot;[[time dilation]]&quot; effects only seem to be taking place upon reflection and do not truly occur within dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Bolz. &quot;[http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/time-passes-dreams/ How Time Passes in Dreams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131123724/http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/time-passes-dreams/ |date=2016-01-31 }}&quot; in ''A Moment of Science''. Indiana Public Media. September 2, 2009. Accessed August 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This close correlation of REM sleep and dream experience was the basis of the first series of reports describing the nature of dreaming: that it is a regular nightly rather than occasional phenomenon, and is correlated with high-frequency activity within each sleep period occurring at predictable intervals of approximately every 60–90 minutes in all humans throughout the lifespan.

REM sleep episodes and the dreams that accompany them lengthen progressively through the night, with the first episode being the shortest, of approximately 10–12 minutes duration, and the second and third episodes increasing to 15–20 minutes. Dreams at the end of the night may last as long as 15 minutes, although these may be experienced as several distinct episodes due to momentary arousals interrupting sleep as the night ends. Dream reports can be reported from normal subjects 50% of the time when they are awakened prior to the end of the first REM period. This rate of retrieval is increased to about 99% when awakenings are made from the last REM period of the night. The increase in the ability to recall dreams appears related to intensification across the night in the vividness of dream imagery, colors, and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Tomoka|title=Dream mechanisms: Is REM sleep indispensable for dreaming?|journal=Sleep &amp; Biological Rhythms|date=June 2005|volume=3|issue=2|pages=56–63|doi=10.1111/j.1479-8425.2005.00165.x|s2cid=144351269}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--this entire paragraph needs references; someone with a copy of Dement's book might be able to help--&gt;

===Brain activity===

One of the central questions of sleep research is what part of the brain is driving dreams' video-auditory experience. During waking, most of the mind's internal imagery is controlled from the front of the brain by the [[lateral prefrontal cortex]] (LPFC). Reasoning, planning, and strategizing are the results of the [[Prefrontal synthesis|constructive imagination]] conducted by the LPFC, which acts like a puppeteer assembling objects stored in memory into novel combinations. During REM sleep, however the LPFC is inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Braun |first1=A. |title=Regional cerebral blood flow throughout the sleep-wake cycle. An H2(15)O PET study |journal=Brain |date=1 July 1997 |volume=120 |issue=7 |pages=1173–1197 |doi=10.1093/brain/120.7.1173 |pmid=9236630|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Siclari |first1=Francesca |last2=Baird |first2=Benjamin |last3=Perogamvros |first3=Lampros |last4=Bernardi |first4=Giulio |last5=LaRocque |first5=Joshua J |last6=Riedner |first6=Brady |last7=Boly |first7=Melanie |last8=Postle |first8=Bradley R |last9=Tononi |first9=Giulio |title=The neural correlates of dreaming |journal=Nature Neuroscience |date=10 April 2017 |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=872–878 |doi=10.1038/nn.4545|pmid=28394322 |pmc=5462120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in people whose LPFC is damaged, dreams do not change at all, confirming that LPFC does not control dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315806440|title=The Neuropsychology of Dreams: A Clinico-anatomical Study|last=Solms|first=Mark|date=2014-02-25|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781315806440|edition=1|doi=10.4324/9781315806440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During deep [[slow-wave sleep]], imagery is primarily driven by the [[hippocampus]] in the process of long-term [[memory consolidation]] and predominantly includes memories of events “as they happened” without the random novel combination of objects seen in REM sleep dreams. During REM sleep, however, the communication between the [[neocortex]] and the hippocampus is disrupted by a high [[Acetylcholine|ACh]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wierzynski |first1=Casimir M. |last2=Lubenov |first2=Evgueniy V. |last3=Gu |first3=Ming |last4=Siapas |first4=Athanassios G. |title=State-Dependent Spike-Timing Relationships between Hippocampal and Prefrontal Circuits during Sleep |journal=Neuron |date=February 2009 |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=587–596 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.01.011|pmid=19249278 |pmc=2701743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without being driven by the LPFC (as in waking) and hippocampus (as in [[slow-wave sleep]]), it is unclear how exactly images appear in one's perception during REM sleep. A common explanation is that [[Neural ensemble|neuronal ensembles]] in the [[posterior cortical hot zone]], primed by previous activity or current sensory or subcortical stimulation, activate spontaneously, triggered by the [[PGO waves|ponto-geniculo-occipital]] (PGO) waves that characterize REM sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Penelope A.|last2=Knoblich|first2=Günther|last3=Poe|first3=Gina|date=June 2018|title=How Memory Replay in Sleep Boosts Creative Problem-Solving|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=22|issue=6|pages=491–503|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2018.03.009|pmid=29776467|pmc=7543772|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/111453/1/Lewis.%20How%20memory%20replay.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Hobson &amp; McCarley, the neocortex is making “the best of a bad job in producing even partially coherent dream imagery from the relatively noisy signals sent up from the brain stem.”&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solms|first=Mark|date=December 2000|title=Dreaming and REM sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=23|issue=6|pages=843–850|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00003988|pmid=11515144|s2cid=7264870|url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1146/7e7414c35094ea2262dc659da26bd6b1b11f.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also commonly accepted that the intensity of dreams during REM sleep can be dialed up or down by the dopaminergic cells of the [[ventral tegmental area]]. For example, drugs that block dopaminergic activity (e.g., [[haloperidol]]) inhibit unusually frequent and vivid dreaming, while the increase of [[dopamine]] (e.g., through [[L-DOPA|l-dopa]]) stimulates excessive vivid dreaming and [[nightmare]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
===Dreams and Cognitive Capacity===

Although the dominant view is that the waking and dreaming mind differ in their cognitive capacities, there is more evidence to show that the dreaming mind has a similar cognitive capacity as that of the waking mind. That is, the dreaming mind can be just as volitional and rational as it is in waking consciousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kahan|first1=Tracey L.|last2=LaBerge|first2=Stephen P.|date=September 2011|title=Dreaming and waking: similarities and differences revisited|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20933437/|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=20|issue=3|pages=494–514|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.09.002|issn=1090-2376|pmid=20933437|s2cid=34942146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucid dreaming is a clear example where such cognitive capacity, for example, through means of self-reflection, is demonstrated in the dream state; however, functions such as reflective awareness, choice, focus, etc. are also possible in non-lucid dreaming. In one study by Kahan et al., 72 dreams produced from 16 participants were examined to determine the relationship between dreaming and waking metacognition. After conducting a procedure with specialized equipment to capture the phasic REM sleep, the participants were awakened to produce the narratives of their dreams. These narratives were transcribed for further analysis, and the participants were made to fill out a continuous-scale questionnaire to rate different cognitive abilities such as 'choice', 'attention captured suddenly', 'focused-attention', 'public self-consciousness' (concern for how one appears to others), 'reflective-awareness', ability to perceive their own thoughts (labeled as 'own thoughts and feelings'), 'own behavior',  and 'external events'. The participants of this study gave a higher pervasiveness rating to their wakeful capacities in 'choice' and 'reflective awareness', but rated all other features similarly.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

After completing the first questionnaire, the participants were then given a second questionnaire to rate 9 cognitive activities using the Subjective Experiences Rating Scale, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). It was found that average pervasiveness ratings were lower for: thinking, planning, imagining, and remembering in comparison to the participants’ waking experiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;  Moreover, mean pervasiveness ratings of dreaming and waking experiences did not show difference for: evaluating, talking, listening, or attending (to both external and internal events). Overall, the authors suggested that dreaming and waking experiences are more likely to differ in their executive processes such as decision making, problem solving, planning and agency but are more likely to be similar in their utilization of analytical though processes like reason, logic, reflection, contemplation, ability to compare and contrast, and evaluate. This is one such study that challenges that higher order cognitive ability is absent or suspended in REM sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

REM sleep and the ability to dream seem to be embedded in the biology of many animals in addition to humans.

Studies have observed signs of dreaming in all mammals studied, including monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, elephants, and shrews. There have also been signs of dreaming in birds and reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dream|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/171188/dream|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=October 26, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111055406/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/171188/dream|archive-date=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleeping and dreaming are intertwined. Scientific research results regarding the function of dreaming in animals remain disputable; however, the function of sleeping in living organisms is increasingly clear. For example, sleep deprivation experiments conducted on rats and other animals have resulted in the deterioration of physiological functioning and actual tissue damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Sleep|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548545/sleep|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=October 26, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111055359/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548545/sleep|archive-date=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists argue that humans dream for the same reason other [[amniote]]s do. From a Darwinian perspective dreams would have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement, provide some benefit for natural selection to take place, or at least have no negative impact on fitness. In 2000 Antti Revonsuo, a professor at the University of Turku in Finland, claimed that centuries ago dreams would prepare humans for recognizing and avoiding danger by presenting a simulation of threatening events. The theory has therefore been called the threat-simulation theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Williams|first=Daniel|title=While you were sleeping|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1606872,00.html|magazine=Time magazine|access-date=October 26, 2011|date=April 5, 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026193118/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1606872,00.html|archive-date=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tsoukalas (2012) dreaming is related to the reactive patterns elicited by encounters with predators, a fact that is still evident in the control mechanisms of REM sleep (see below).&lt;ref name=Tsoukalas2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsoukalas | first1 = I | year = 2012 | title = The origin of REM sleep: A hypothesis | journal = Dreaming | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 253–283 | doi=10.1037/a0030790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vitelli2013&gt;Vitelli, R.

== Function ==

Many hypotheses have been proposed as to what function dreams perform, some of which have been contradicted by later empirical studies. It has also been proposed that dreams serve no particular purpose, and that they are simply a byproduct of biochemical processes that only occur in the brain during sleep.

====Freud's view====
In the late 19th century, psychotherapist [[Sigmund Freud]] developed a theory (since discredited) that the content of dreams is driven by unconscious [[wish fulfillment]]. Freud called dreams the &quot;[[royal road]] to the unconscious.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1949)., p. 44{{clarify|date=January 2019}}&lt;!-- What book or document does this refer to?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that the content of dreams reflects the dreamer's unconscious mind and specifically that dream content is shaped by unconscious wish fulfillment. He argued that important unconscious desires often relate to early childhood memories and experiences. Freud's theory describes dreams as having both [[:wikt:manifest|manifest]] and [[wikt:latent|latent]] content. Latent content relates to deep unconscious wishes or fantasies while manifest content is superficial and meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Latent dream-content (pp. 31ff.) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbauAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Dreams |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbauAwAAQBAJ |year=2014 |orig-year=[https://books.google.com/?id=xFtqAAAAMAAJ 1969] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-1-317-67048-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manifest content often masks or obscures latent content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Manifest content (pp. 54ff.) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZixAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT44 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Dreams |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZixAwAAQBAJ |year=2014 |orig-year=1969 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon-on-Thames |isbn=978-1-317-67047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early work, Freud argued that the vast majority of latent dream content is sexual in nature, but he later moved away from this categorical position. In ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' he considered how trauma or aggression could influence dream content. He also discussed supernatural origins in ''Dreams and Occultism'', a lecture published in ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis''.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (pp. 38–70).&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in life Freud acknowledged that &quot;It is impossible to classify as wish fulfillments&quot; the repetitive nightmares associated with posttraumatic stress disorder. Modern experimental studies weigh against many of Freud's theories regarding dreams. Freud's &quot;dream-work&quot; interpretation strategies have not been found to have empirical validity. His theory that dreams were the &quot;guardians&quot; of sleep, repressing and disguising bodily urges to ensure sleep continues, seems unlikely given studies of individuals who can sleep without dreaming. His assertions that repressed memory in infants re-surface decades later in adult dreams conflicts with modern research on memory. Freud's theory has difficulty explaining why young children have static and bland dreams, or why the emotions in most dreams are negative. On the plus side, modern researchers agree with Freud that dreams do have coherence, and that dream content connects to other psychological variables and often connect to recent waking thoughts (though not as often as Freud supposed).&lt;ref&gt;Domhoff, G.W. (2000). Moving Dream Theory Beyond Freud and Jung. Paper presented to the symposium &quot;Beyond Freud and Jung?&quot;, Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, CA, 9/23/2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of scientific evidence, dream interpretation services based on Freudian or other systems remain popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Folly of Dream Interpretation|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dream-catcher/201307/the-folly-dream-interpretation|access-date=14 January 2018|work=Psychology Today|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jung's view====
{{missing|scientific consensus for or against Jung's theory|date=February 2019}}
[[Carl Jung]] rejected many of Freud's theories. Jung expanded on Freud's idea that dream content relates to the dreamer's unconscious desires. He described dreams as [[message]]s to the dreamer and argued that dreamers should pay attention for their own good. He came to believe that dreams present the dreamer with revelations that can uncover and help to resolve [[emotion]]al or religious problems and fears.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, 1964, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung wrote that [[recurring dream]]s show up repeatedly to demand attention, suggesting that the dreamer is neglecting an issue related to the dream. He called this &quot;compensation.&quot; The dream balances the conscious belief and attitudes with an alternative. Jung did not believe that the conscious attitude was wrong and that the dream provided the true belief. He argued that good work with dreams takes both into account and comes up with a balanced viewpoint. He believed that many of the symbols or images from these dreams return with each dream. Jung believed that memories formed throughout the day also play a role in dreaming. These memories leave impressions for the unconscious to deal with when the ego is at rest. The unconscious mind re-enacts these glimpses of the past in the form of a dream. Jung called this a ''day residue''.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Jung also argued that dreaming is not a purely individual concern, that all dreams are part of &quot;one great web of psychological factors.&quot;

====Fritz Perls' view====
{{missing|scientific consensus for or against Perls' theory|date=February 2019}}
[[Fritz Perls]] presented his theory of dreams as part of the holistic nature of [[Gestalt therapy]]. Dreams are seen as projections of parts of the self that have been ignored, rejected, or [[thought suppression|suppressed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wenzlaff | first2 = R.M. | last3 = Kozak | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = The Return of Suppressed Thoughts in Dreams | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 232–236 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00657.x | pmid=15043639| s2cid = 16204869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jung argued that one could consider every person in the dream to represent an aspect of the dreamer, which he called the subjective approach to dreams. [[Fritz Perls|Perls]] expanded this point of view to say that even inanimate objects in the dream may represent aspects of the dreamer. The dreamer may, therefore, be asked to imagine being an object in the dream and to describe it, in order to bring into awareness the characteristics of the object that correspond with the dreamer's personality.

===Neurological theories===
====Activation synthesis theory====
{{Main|Activation-synthesis hypothesis}}

In 1976 [[J. Allan Hobson]] and [[Robert McCarley]] proposed a new theory that changed dream research, challenging the previously held [[Freudian]] view of dreams as unconscious wishes to be interpreted. They assume that the same structures that induce REM sleep also generate sensory information. Hobson's 1976 research suggested that the signals interpreted as dreams originate in the brainstem during REM sleep. According to Hobson and other researchers, circuits in the brainstem are activated during REM sleep. Once these circuits are activated, areas of the limbic system involved in emotions, sensations, and memories, including the amygdala and hippocampus, become active. The brain synthesizes and interprets these activities; for example, changes in the physical environment such as temperature and humidity, or physical stimuli such as ejaculation, and attempts to create meaning from these signals, result in dreaming.

However, research by [[Mark Solms]] suggests that dreams are generated in the [[forebrain]], and that REM sleep and dreaming are not directly related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Solms |first=M. |year=2000 |title=Dreaming and REM sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms |volume=23 |issue=6 |journal= Behavioral and Brain Sciences |edition=23(6) |pages=793–1121|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00003988 |pmid=11515144 |s2cid=7264870 |url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1146/7e7414c35094ea2262dc659da26bd6b1b11f.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While working in the neurosurgery department at hospitals in [[Johannesburg]] and [[London]], Solms had access to patients with various brain injuries. He began to question patients about their dreams and confirmed that patients with damage to the [[parietal lobe]] stopped dreaming; this finding was in line with Hobson's 1977 theory. However, Solms did not encounter cases of loss of dreaming with patients having brainstem damage. This observation forced him to question Hobson's prevailing theory, which marked the brainstem as the source of the signals interpreted as dreams.

====Continual-activation theory====
Combining Hobson's activation synthesis hypothesis with Solms' findings, the continual-activation theory of dreaming presented by Jie Zhang proposes that dreaming is a result of brain activation and synthesis; at the same time, dreaming and REM sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms. Zhang hypothesizes that the function of sleep is to process, encode, and transfer the data from the temporary memory store to the [[long-term memory]] store. During [[NREM]] sleep the conscious-related memory (declarative memory) is processed, and during REM sleep the unconscious-related memory (procedural memory) is processed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Zhang |first=Jie |year=2005 |title=Continual-activation theory of dreaming, Dynamical Psychology |url=http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2005/ZhangDreams.htm |access-date=March 13, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427051723/http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2005/ZhangDreams.htm |archive-date=April 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang assumes that during REM sleep the unconscious part of a brain is busy processing the procedural memory; meanwhile, the level of activation in the conscious part of the brain descends to a very low level as the inputs from the sensory systems are basically disconnected. This triggers the &quot;continual-activation&quot; mechanism to generate a data stream from the memory stores to flow through the conscious part of the brain. Zhang suggests that this pulsatile brain activation is the inducer of each dream. He proposes that, with the involvement of the brain associative thinking system, dreaming is, thereafter, self-maintained with the dreamer's own thinking until the next pulse of memory insertion. This explains why dreams have both characteristics of continuity (within a dream) and sudden changes (between two dreams).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang 2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zhang |first=Jie |year=2004 |title=Memory process and the function of sleep |publisher=Journal of Theoretics |edition=6–6 |url=http://www.journaloftheoretics.com/Articles/6-6/Zhang.pdf |access-date=March 13, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320065919/http://www.journaloftheoretics.com/Articles/6-6/Zhang.pdf |archive-date=March 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed explanation of how a dream is synthesized is given in a later paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zhang |first=Jie |year=2016 |title=Towards a comprehensive model of human memory|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.2103.9606 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304604880 |access-date=July 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807000307/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304604880_Towards_a_comprehensive_model_of_human_memory |archive-date=August 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defensive immobilization: the precursor====
According to Tsoukalas (2012) REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the [[tonic immobility]] reflex. This reflex, also known as animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as the last line of defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal: the animal appears dead (cf. &quot;playing possum&quot;). Tsoukalas claims that the neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction shows striking similarities to REM sleep, a fact that suggests a deep evolutionary kinship. For example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, hippocampal theta and thermoregulatory changes. Tsoukalas claims that this theory integrates many earlier findings into a unified framework.&lt;ref name=Tsoukalas2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vitelli2013/&gt;

====As excitations of long-term memory====
{{missing|scientific consensus for or against Tarnow's theory|date=February 2019}}
Eugen Tarnow suggests that dreams are ever-present excitations of [[long-term memory]], even during waking life. The strangeness of dreams is due to the format of long-term memory, reminiscent of [[Wilder Penfield|Penfield]] &amp; Rasmussen's findings that electrical excitations of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] give rise to experiences similar to dreams. During waking life an executive function interprets long-term memory consistent with reality checking. Tarnow's theory is a reworking of Freud's theory of dreams in which Freud's unconscious is replaced with the long-term memory system and Freud's &quot;Dream Work&quot; describes the structure of long-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tarnow |first=Eugen |year=2003 |title=How Dreams And Memory May Be Related |publisher=NEURO-PSYCHOANALYSIS |edition=5(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role in strengthening semantic memories====
[[File:Hippocampus.svg|thumb|Location of the [[hippocampus|hippocampi]]]]

A 2001 study showed evidence that illogical locations, characters, and dream flow may help the brain strengthen the linking and consolidation of [[semantic memory|semantic memories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/the-health-benefits-of-dreams |title=The Health Benefits of Dreams |publisher=Webmd.com |date=February 25, 2009 |access-date=August 11, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806041259/http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/the-health-benefits-of-dreams |archive-date=August 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions may occur because, during REM sleep, the flow of information between the [[hippocampus]] and [[neocortex]] is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R. Stickgold, J.A. Hobson, R. Fosse, M. Fosse1 |date=November 2001 |title= Sleep, Learning, and Dreams: Off-line Memory Reprocessing |journal=Science |pmid=11691983 |volume=294 |issue=5544 |pages=1052–1057 |doi=10.1126/science.1063530|bibcode=2001Sci...294.1052S |s2cid=8631140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing levels of the [[stress (biology)|stress]] hormone [[cortisol]] late in sleep (often during REM sleep) causes this decreased communication. One stage of [[memory consolidation]] is the linking of distant but related memories. Payne and Nadal hypothesize these memories are then consolidated into a smooth narrative, similar to a process that happens when memories are created under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/lm.77104 |author=Jessica D. Payne and Lynn Nadel1 |year=2004 |title=Sleep, dreams, and memory consolidation: The role of the stress hormone cortisol |journal=Learning &amp; Memory |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=671–678 |issn=1072-0502 |pmid=15576884 |pmc=534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Robert (1886),&lt;ref&gt;Robert, W. Der Traum als Naturnothwendigkeit erklärt. Zweite Auflage, Hamburg: Seippel, 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; a physician from Hamburg, was the first who suggested that dreams are a need and that they have the function to erase (a) sensory impressions that were not fully worked up, and (b) ideas that were not fully developed during the day. By the dream work, incomplete material is either removed (suppressed) or deepened and included into memory. Robert's ideas were cited repeatedly by Freud in his ''Die Traumdeutung''. [[Hughlings Jackson]] (1911) viewed that sleep serves to sweep away unnecessary memories and connections from the day.

This was revised in 1983 by Crick and Mitchison's &quot;[[reverse learning]]&quot; theory, which states that dreams are like the cleaning-up operations of computers when they are offline, removing (suppressing) parasitic nodes and other &quot;junk&quot; from the mind during sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = C. | last2 = Newman | first2 = E. | year = 1964 | title = Dreaming: An analogy from computers | journal = New Scientist | volume = 419 | pages = 577–579 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/304111a0 | last1 = Crick | first1 = F. | last2 = Mitchison | first2 = G. | year = 1983 | title = The function of dream sleep | journal = Nature | volume = 304 | issue = 5922| pages = 111–114 | pmid = 6866101 | bibcode = 1983Natur.304..111C | s2cid = 41500914 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the opposite view that dreaming has an information handling, memory-consolidating function (Hennevin and Leconte, 1971) is also common.

===Psychological theories===
====Role in testing and selecting mental schemas====
Coutts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2466/pr0.102.2.561-574 | last1 = Coutts | first1 = R | year = 2008 | title = Dreams as modifiers and tests of mental schemas: an emotional selection hypothesis | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 102 | issue = 2| pages = 561–574 | pmid = 18567225 | s2cid = 32853481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes{{qualify evidence}} dreams as playing a central role in a two-phase sleep process that improves the mind's ability to meet human needs during wakefulness. During the accommodation phase, mental schemas self-modify by incorporating dream themes. During the [[emotional selection]] phase, dreams test prior schema accommodations. Those that appear adaptive are retained, while those that appear maladaptive are culled. The cycle maps to the sleep cycle, repeating several times during a typical night's sleep. [[Alfred Adler]] suggested that dreams are often emotional preparations for solving problems, intoxicating an individual away from common sense toward private logic. The residual dream feelings may either reinforce or inhibit contemplated action.

====Evolutionary psychology theories====
Numerous theories state that dreaming is a random by-product of REM sleep physiology and that it does not serve any natural purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Revonsuo |first=A. |title=The reinterpretation of dreams: an evolutionary hypothesis of the function of dreaming |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |year=2000 |volume=23 |issue=6 |pmid=11515147 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00004015 |pages=877–901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flanagan claims that &quot;dreams are evolutionary [[Epiphenomenon|epiphenomena]]&quot; and they have no adaptive function. &quot;Dreaming came along as a free ride on a system designed to think and to sleep.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackmore|first=Susan|title=Consciousness an introduction|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-515343-9|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J.A. Hobson, for different reasons, also considers dreams epiphenomena. He believes that the substance of dreams have no significant influence on waking actions, and most people go about their daily lives perfectly well without remembering their dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackmore|first=Susan|title=Consciousness an introduction|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-515343-9|pages=342–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobson proposed the activation-synthesis theory, which states that &quot;there is a randomness of dream imagery and the randomness synthesizes dream-generated images to fit the patterns of internally generated stimulations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tubo |first=J |title=The evolution of dreaming |url=http://webpub.allegheny.edu/employee/r/rmumme/FS101/ResearchPapers/JackieTubo.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928083933/http://webpub.allegheny.edu/employee/r/rmumme/FS101/ResearchPapers/JackieTubo.html |archive-date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is based on the physiology of REM sleep, and Hobson believes dreams are the outcome of the forebrain reacting to random activity beginning at the brainstem. The activation-synthesis theory hypothesizes that the peculiar nature of dreams is attributed to certain parts of the brain trying to piece together a story out of what is essentially bizarre information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=M|author2=Zyphur, M|title=The role of dreams in the evolution of the human mind|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|year=2005|volume=3|pages=59–78|url=http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep035978.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811005842/http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep035978.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-11|doi=10.1177/147470490500300106|s2cid=18250672}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Hobson published a book, ''Thirteen Dreams that Freud Never Had'',&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, J.A. (2005). ''Thirteen Dreams that Freud Never Had''. New York: Pi Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he analyzed his own dreams after having a stroke in 2001.

Some evolutionary psychologists believe dreams serve some adaptive function for survival. [[Deirdre Barrett]] describes dreaming as simply &quot;thinking in different biochemical state&quot; and believes people continue to work on all the same problems—personal and objective—in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url={{Google books|id=ojvXAAAAMAAJ|plainurl=yes}}|last=Barrett|first=Deirdre|chapter=An Evolutionary Theory of Dreams and Problem-Solving |editor-last=Barrett|editor-first=D.L.|editor2-last=McNamara |editor2-first=P. |title=The New Science of Dreaming, Volume III: Cultural and Theoretical Perspectives on Dreaming |location=New York |publisher=Praeger/Greenwood |year=2007 |access-date=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research finds that anything—math, musical composition, business dilemmas—may get solved during dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |id=v-SzPAAACAAJ |plainurl=yes }} |last=Barrett |first=Deirdre |title=The Committee of Sleep: How Artists, Scientists, and Athletes Use their Dreams for Creative Problem Solving—and How You Can Too |location=New York |publisher=Crown Books/Random House |year=2001 }}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asdreams.org/journal/articles/barrett3-2.htm |title=Barrett, Deirdre.

Finnish psychologist Antti Revonsuo posits that dreams have evolved for &quot;threat simulation&quot; exclusively. According to the Threat Simulation Theory he proposes, during much of human evolution physical and interpersonal threats were serious, giving reproductive advantage to those who survived them. Therefore, dreaming evolved to replicate these threats and continually practice dealing with them. In support of this theory, Revonsuo shows that contemporary dreams comprise much more threatening events than people meet in daily non-dream life, and the dreamer usually engages appropriately with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackmore 2004 342–343&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackmore|first=Susan|title=Consciousness an Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/consciousnessint00blac|url-access=limited|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-515343-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/consciousnessint00blac/page/n356 342]–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested by this theory that dreams serve the purpose of allowing for the rehearsal of threatening scenarios in order to better prepare an individual for real-life threats.

According to Tsoukalas (2012) the biology of dreaming is related to the reactive patterns elicited by predatorial encounters (especially the tonic immobility reflex), a fact that lends support to evolutionary theories claiming that dreams specialize in threat avoidance or emotional processing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsoukalas2012&quot;/&gt;

====Other hypotheses====

There are many other hypotheses about the function of dreams, including:&lt;ref name=&quot;cartwrightcontent&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1993 |title=Functions of Dreams |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreaming |last=Cartwright |first=Rosalind D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that dreams may function, in part, to recombine unconscious elements within consciousness on a temporary basis by a process they term &quot;mental recombination&quot;, in analogy with genetic recombination of DNA. From a bio-computational viewpoint, mental recombination may contribute to maintaining an optimal information processing flexibility in brain information networks.

From the 1940s to 1985, [[Calvin S. Hall]] collected more than 50,000 dream reports at [[Western Reserve University]]. In 1966 Hall and Van De Castle published ''The Content Analysis of Dreams'', in which they outlined a coding system to study 1,000 dream reports from college students.&lt;ref name=&quot;hallcontent&quot;&gt;Hall, C., &amp; Van de Castle, R. (1966). The Content Analysis of Dreams. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.

Hall's complete dream reports were made publicly available in the mid-1990s by Hall's protégé [[William Domhoff]].

===Visuals===
The visual nature of dreams is generally highly phantasmagoric; that is, different locations and objects continuously blend into each other. The visuals (including locations, characters/people, objects/artifacts) are generally reflective of a person's memories and experiences, but conversation can take on highly exaggerated and bizarre forms. Some dreams may even tell elaborate stories wherein the dreamer enters entirely new, complex worlds and awakes with ideas, thoughts and feelings never experienced prior to the dream.

People who are blind from birth do not have visual dreams. Their dream contents are related to other senses like [[hearing]], [[Somatosensory system|touch]], [[Olfaction|smell]] and [[taste]], whichever are present since birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How do blind people dream? – The Body Odd |url=http://bodyodd.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/03/09/10602730-how-do-blind-people-dream?lite |date=March 2012 |access-date=May 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124114342/http://bodyodd.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/03/09/10602730-how-do-blind-people-dream?lite |archive-date=January 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual themes===

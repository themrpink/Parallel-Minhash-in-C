Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Bulgarian government declared war on the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. This action remained largely symbolic (at least from the Bulgarian perspective), until August 1943, when Bulgarian air defense and air force attacked Allied bombers, returning (heavily damaged) from a mission over the Romanian oil refineries. This turned into a disaster for the citizens of [[Sofia]] and other major Bulgarian cities, which were heavily bombed by the Allies in the winter of 1943–1944.

On 2 September 1944, as the [[Red Army]] approached the Bulgarian border, a new Bulgarian government came to power and sought peace with the Allies, expelled the few remaining German troops, and declared neutrality. These measures however did not prevent the Soviet Union from declaring war on Bulgaria on 5 September, and on 8 September the Red Army marched into the country, meeting no resistance. This was followed by the [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|coup d'état of 9 September 1944]], which brought a government of the pro-Soviet [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] to power. After this, the Bulgarian army (as part of the Red Army's [[3rd Ukrainian Front]]) fought the Germans in Yugoslavia and Hungary, sustaining numerous casualties. Despite this, the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] treated Bulgaria as one of the defeated countries. Bulgaria was allowed to keep [[Southern Dobruja]], but had to give up all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory.


===Hungary===
{{Main|Hungary during World War II|Government of National Unity (Hungary)}}
[[File:Toldi.jpg|thumb|Hungarian [[Toldi (tank)|Toldi I]] tank as used during the 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]][[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], ruled by [[Regent]] Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]], was the first country apart from Germany, Italy, and Japan to adhere to the Tripartite Pact, signing the agreement on 20 November 1940. Slovakia had been a client state of Germany since 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Seamus Dunn, T.G. Fraser. Europe and Ethnicity: The First World War and Contemporary Ethnic Conflict. Routledge, 1996. P97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political instability plagued the country until Miklós Horthy, a Hungarian nobleman and [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian naval]] officer, became regent in 1920. The vast majority of the Hungarians desired to recover territories lost through the [[Trianon Treaty]]. The country drew closer to Germany and Italy largely because of a shared desire to revise the peace settlements made after World War I.{{sfn|Montgomery|2002|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} Many people sympathized with the [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] policy of the Nazi regime. Due to its supportive stance towards Germany and the new efforts in the international policy, Hungary gained favourable territorial settlements by the [[First Vienna Award]], after the breakup of [[Czechoslovakia]] occupied and annexed the remainder of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] and in 1940 received [[Northern Transylvania]] from Romania via the [[Second Vienna Award]]. Hungarians permitted German troops to transit through their territory during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], and Hungarian forces joined the military operations after the proclamation of the Independent State of Croatia. Parts of the former Yugoslavia were annexed to Hungary; the United Kingdom immediately broke off diplomatic relations in response.

Although Hungary did not initially participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Hungary and the [[Soviet Union]] became belligerents on 27 June 1941. Over 500,000 soldiers served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. All five of Hungary's field armies ultimately participated in the war against the Soviet Union; a significant contribution was made by the [[Hungarian Second Army]].[[File:Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians.jpg|thumb|Hungarian soldiers in the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1944]]

On 25 November 1941, Hungary was one of thirteen signatories to the renewed Anti-Comintern Pact. Hungarian troops, like their Axis counterparts, were involved in numerous actions against the Soviets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets had gained the upper hand and the Germans were retreating. The Hungarian Second Army was destroyed in fighting on the [[Voronezh Front]], on the banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. 

Prior to the [[Operation Margarethe|German occupation]] within the area of Hungary around 63,000 Jews perished. Afterwards, in late 1944, 437,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, most of them to their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;''Hungary and the Holocaust Confrontation with the Past'' (2001) (Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies United States Holocaust Memorial Museum); Tim Cole;  ''Hungary, the Holocaust, and Hungarians: Remembering Whose History?''  p. 3-5; [https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/Publication_OP_2001-01.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Hungarian Jews suffered close to 560,000 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph L. Braham; (2010) ''Hungarian, German, and Jewish calculations and miscalculations in the last chapter of the Holocaust'' p. 9-10; Washington, D.C. : Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, [https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/Publication_OP_2010-01.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between Germany and the regency of [[Miklós Horthy]] collapsed in 1944 when Horthy attempted to negotiate a peace agreement with the Soviets and jump out of the war without German approval. Horthy was forced to abdicate after German commandos, led by Colonel [[Otto Skorzeny]], held his son hostage as part of [[Operation Panzerfaust]]. Hungary was reorganized following Horthy's abdication in December 1944 into a totalitarian regime called the [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]], led by [[Ferenc Szálasi]]. He had been Prime Minister of Hungary since October 1944 and was leader of the [[Hungarism|Hungarist]] [[Arrow Cross Party]]. Its jurisdiction was effectively limited to an ever-narrowing band of territory in central Hungary, around Budapest since by the time they took power the [[Red Army]] was already far inside the country. Nonetheless, the Arrow Cross rule, short-lived as it was, was brutal. In fewer than three months, Arrow Cross death squads killed as many as 38,000 Hungarian Jews. Arrow Cross officers helped [[Adolf Eichmann]] re-activate the deportation proceedings from which the Jews of Budapest had thus far been spared, sending some 80,000 Jews out of the city on slave labour details and many more straight to death camps. Most of them died, including many who were murdered outright after the end of the fighting as they were returning home.&lt;ref name=&quot;remeny.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remeny.org/node/36 |title=Szita Szabolcs: A budapesti csillagos házak (1944-45) &amp;#124; Remény |website=Remeny.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osa.ceu.hu/galeria/sites/siege/section2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-18 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202124928/http://www.osa.ceu.hu/galeria/sites/siege/section2.html |archivedate=2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Days after the Szálasi government took power, the capital of [[Budapest]] was surrounded by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. German and Hungarian forces tried to hold off the Soviet advance but failed. After fierce fighting, Budapest was taken by the Soviets. A number of pro-German Hungarians retreated to Italy and Germany, where they fought until the end of the war.

In March 1945, Szálasi fled to Germany as the leader of a government in exile, until the surrender of Germany in May 1945.

=== Independent State of Croatia ===
{{Main|Independent State of Croatia}}
[[File:Adolf Hitler meets Ante Pavelić.1941.jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] meeting with NDH leader [[Ante Pavelić]].]]

On 10 April 1941, the so-called Independent State of Croatia (''Nezavisna Država Hrvatska'', or NDH), an installed German-Italian puppet state co-signed the Tripartite Pact. The NDH remained a member of the Axis until the end of Second World War, its forces fighting for Germany even after its territory had been overrun by [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. On 16 April 1941, [[Ante Pavelić]], a Croatian nationalist and one of the founders of the [[Ustaše]] (''&quot;Croatian Liberation Movement&quot;''), was proclaimed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (leader) of the new regime.

Initially the Ustaše had been heavily influenced by Italy. They were actively supported by Mussolini's Fascist regime in Italy, which gave the movement training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia, as well as accepting Pavelić as an exile and allowing him to reside in Rome. Italy intended to use the movement to destroy Yugoslavia, which would allow Italy to expand its power through the Adriatic. Hitler did not want to engage in a war in the Balkans until the Soviet Union was defeated. The Italian occupation of Greece was not going well; Mussolini wanted Germany to invade Yugoslavia to save the Italian forces in Greece. Hitler reluctantly agreed; Yugoslavia was invaded and the NDH was created. Pavelić led a delegation to Rome and offered the crown of the NDH to an Italian prince of the House of Savoy, who was crowned ''[[Tomislav II]], King of Croatia, Prince of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Voivode of Dalmatia, [[Tuzla]] and Knin, Prince of [[Cisterna]] and of Belriguardo, Marquess of [[Voghera]], and Count of [[Ponderano]].'' The next day, Pavelić signed the Contracts of Rome with Mussolini, ceding Dalmatia to Italy and fixing the permanent borders between the NDH and Italy. Italian armed forces were allowed to control all of the coastline of the NDH, effectively giving Italy total control of the Adriatic coastline.

However, strong German influence began to be asserted soon after the NDH was founded. When the King of Italy ousted Mussolini from power and Italy capitulated, the NDH became completely under German influence.

The platform of the Ustaše movement proclaimed that Croatians had been oppressed by the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and that Croatians deserved to have an independent nation after years of domination by foreign empires. The Ustaše perceived Serbs to be racially inferior to Croats and saw them as infiltrators who were occupying Croatian lands. They saw the extermination and expulsion or deportation of Serbs as necessary to racially purify Croatia. While part of Yugoslavia, many Croatian nationalists violently opposed the Serb-dominated Yugoslav monarchy, and assassinated [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], together with the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]. The regime enjoyed support amongst radical Croatian nationalists. Ustashe forces fought against communist Yugoslav Partisan guerrilla throughout the war.

Upon coming to power, Pavelić formed the [[Croatian Home Guard (World War II)|Croatian Home Guard]] (''Hrvatsko domobranstvo'') as the official military force of the NDH. Originally authorized at 16,000 men, it grew to a peak fighting force of 130,000. The Croatian Home Guard included an air force and navy, although its navy was restricted in size by the Contracts of Rome. In addition to the Croatian Home Guard, Pavelić was also the supreme commander of the [[Ustaše militia]], although all NDH military units were generally under the command of the German or Italian formations in their area of operations.

The Ustaše government declared war on the Soviet Union, signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941, and sent troops to Germany's Eastern Front. Ustaše militia were garrisoned in the Balkans, battling the communist partisans.

The Ustaše government applied racial laws on Serbs, Jews, [[Romani people]], as well as targeting those opposed to the fascist regime, and after June 1941 deported them to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] or to German camps in Poland. The racial laws were enforced by the Ustaše militia. The exact number of victims of the Ustaše regime is uncertain due to the destruction of documents and varying numbers given by historians. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs were killed in the NDH.&lt;ref name=&quot;US Holocaust Memorial Museum&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030711191159/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005449 Jasenovac] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum web site&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IAR80.jpg|thumb|right|A formation of Romanian [[IAR80]] fighter aircraft]]

When war erupted in Europe in 1939, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] was pro-British and allied to the [[Polish-Romanian alliance|Poles]]. Following the [[invasion of Poland]] by Germany and the Soviet Union, and the German conquest of France and the [[Low Countries]], Romania found itself increasingly isolated; meanwhile, pro-German and pro-Fascist elements began to grow.

The August 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol ceding [[Bessarabia]], and [[Northern Bukovina]] to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} On June 28, 1940, the Soviet Union [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina|occupied and annexed Bessarabia, as well as part of northern Romania]] and the [[Hertza region]].{{sfn|Senn|2007|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} On 30 August 1940, as a result of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-[[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] arbitrated [[Second Vienna Award]] Romania had to cede [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary. [[Southern Dobruja]] was ceded to [[Bulgaria]] in September 1940. In an effort to appease the Fascist elements within the country and obtain German protection, [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] appointed the General [[Ion Antonescu]] as Prime Minister on September 6, 1940.

Two days later, Antonescu forced the king to abdicate and installed the king's young son [[Michael of Romania|Michael]] (Mihai) on the throne, then declared himself ''Conducător'' (&quot;Leader&quot;) with dictatorial powers. The [[National Legionary State]] was proclaimed on 14 September, with the [[Iron Guard]] ruling together with Antonescu as the sole legal political movement in Romania. Under King Michael I and the military government of Antonescu, Romania signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] on November 23, 1940. German troops entered the country on 10 October 1941, officially to train the Romanian Army. Hitler's directive to the troops on 10 October had stated that &quot;it is necessary to avoid even the slightest semblance of military occupation of Romania&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dinu C. Giurescu, ''Romania in the Second World War (1939–1945)'', p.&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance of German troops in Romania determined Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] to launch an invasion of Greece, starting the [[Greco-Italian War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Stockings]], Eleanor Hancock, ''Swastika over the Acropolis: Re-interpreting the Nazi Invasion of Greece in World War II'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Having secured Hitler's approval in January 1941, Antonescu [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|ousted the Iron Guard]] from power.

Romania was subsequently used as a platform for invasions of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Despite not being involved militarily in the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]], Romania requested that Hungarian troops not operate in the [[Banat (1941-1944)|Banat]]. Paulus thus modified the Hungarian plan and kept their troops west of the [[Tisza]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlile Aylmer Macartney, ''October Fifteenth: A History of Modern Hungary, 1929–1945, Volume 1'', p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania joined the German-led invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. Antonescu was the only foreign leader Hitler consulted on military matters&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Deletant, ''Final report'', p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; and the two would meet no less than ten times throughout the war.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Kaplan, ''In Europe's Shadow: Two Cold Wars and a Thirty-Year Journey Through Romania and Beyond'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Romania re-captured Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina during [[Operation Munchen]] before conquering further Soviet territory and establishing the [[Transnistria Governorate]]. After the [[Siege of Odessa]], the city became the capital of the Governorate. Romanian troops [[Crimean Campaign|fought their way into the Crimea]] alongside German troops and contributed significantly to the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|Siege of Sevastopol]]. Later, Romanian mountain troops joined the German campaign in the Caucasus, reaching as far as [[Nalchik]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David T. Zabecki]], ''World War II in Europe: An Encyclopedia'', p. 1421&lt;/ref&gt; After suffering devastating losses [[Romanian armies in the battle of Stalingrad|at Stalingrad]], Romanian officials began secretly negotiating peace conditions with the Allies. 

[[Arms industry in Romania#Weapons produced during World War II and the Interwar period|Romania's military industry]] was small but versatile, able to copy and produce thousands of French, Soviet, German, British, and Czechoslovak weapons systems, as well producing capable original products. &lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Zaloga, ''Tanks of Hitler’s Eastern Allies 1941–45'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Romania also built sizable warships, such as the minelayer {{NMS|Amiral Murgescu}} and the submarines {{NMS|Rechinul}} and {{NMS|Marsuinul}}. Hundreds of originally-designed aircraft were also produced, such as the fighter [[IAR-80]] and the light bomber [[IAR-37]]. Romania had also been a major power in the oil industry since the 1800s. It was one of the largest producers in Europe and the [[Ploiești]] oil refineries provided about 30% of all Axis oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Rick|title=The Guns at Last Light|date=2013|publisher=Henry Holt|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-6290-8|page=354|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian Dennis Deletant has asserted that, Romania's crucial contributions to the Axis war effort, including having the third largest Axis army in Europe and sustaining the German war effort through oil and other materiel, meant that it was &quot;on a par with Italy as a principal ally of Germany and not in the category of a minor Axis satellite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Deletant, &quot;Romania&quot;, in [https://books.google.ro/books?id=VMk-DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=romania+minor+Axis+satellite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmsdLR963cAhUBfFAKHa1qBOoQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=romania%20minor%20Axis%20satellite&amp;f=false David Stahel, ''Joining Hitler's Crusade'' (Cambridge University Press, 2017), p. 78]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Antonescu Romania was fascist dictatorship and a totalitarian state. Between 45,000 and 60,000 Jews were killed in [[Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]] by Romanian and German troops in 1941. According to Wilhelm Filderman at least 150,000 Jews of
Bessarabia and Bukovina, died under the Antonescu regime(both those deported and those who remained). Overall, approximately 250,000 Jews under Romanian jurisdiction died.&lt;ref&gt;Radu Ioanid; (2008) ''The Holocaust in Romania: The Destruction of Jews and Gypsies Under the Antonescu Regime 1940-1944'' p. 289-297; Ivan R. Dee, {{ISBN|1461694906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1943, the tide began to turn. The Soviets pushed further west, retaking Ukraine and eventually launching an [[First Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|unsuccessful invasion]] of eastern Romania in the spring of 1944. Romanian troops in the Crimea [[Kerch-Eltigen Operation|helped repulse initial Soviet landings]], but eventually all of the peninsula was re-conquered by Soviet forces and the [[Romanian Navy]] evacuated over 100,000 German and Romanian troops, an achievement which earned Romanian Admiral Horia Macellariu the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer C. Tucker, ''World War II at Sea: An Encyclopedia'', p. 633&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|Jassy-Kishinev Offensive]] of August 1944, Romania [[King Michael's Coup|switched sides]] on August 23, 1944. Romanian troops then fought alongside the Soviet Army until the end of the war, reaching as far as Czechoslovakia and Austria.

===Slovakia===
{{Main|Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak invasion of Poland}}
[[File:Slovakia1941 02.png|thumb|Slovakia in 1941]]
The [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]] under President [[Josef Tiso]] signed the Tripartite Pact on 24 November 1940.

Slovakia had been closely aligned with Germany almost immediately from its declaration of independence from Czechoslovakia on 14 March 1939. Slovakia entered into a treaty of protection with Germany on 23 March 1939.

Slovak troops joined the German invasion of Poland, having interest in [[Spiš]] and [[Orava (region)|Orava]]. Those two regions, along with [[Cieszyn Silesia]], had been [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts|disputed]] between Poland and Czechoslovakia since 1918. The Poles fully annexed them following the [[Munich Agreement]]. After the invasion of Poland, Slovakia reclaimed control of those territories.
Slovakia invaded Poland alongside German forces, contributing 50,000 men at this stage of the war.

Slovakia declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941 and signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941. Slovak troops fought on Germany's Eastern Front, furnishing Germany with two divisions totaling 80,000 men. Slovakia declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in 1942.

Slovakia was spared German military occupation until the [[Slovak National Uprising]], which began on 29 August 1944, and was almost immediately crushed by the Waffen SS and Slovak troops loyal to Josef Tiso.

After the war, Tiso was executed and Slovakia once again became part of Czechoslovakia. The border with Poland was shifted back to the pre-war state. Slovakia and the Czech Republic finally separated into independent states in 1993.

===Yugoslavia (two-day membership)===
{{main|Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|Yugoslav coup d'état|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}

Yugoslavia was largely surrounded by members of the pact and now bordered the German Reich. From late 1940 Hitler sought a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia. In February 1941, Hitler called for Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact, the Yugoslav delayed.  In March, divisions of the German army arrived at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border and permission was sought for them to pass through to attack Greece. On 25 March 1941, fearing that Yugoslavia would be invaded otherwise, the Yugoslav government signed the Tripartite Pact with significant reservations. Unlike other Axis powers, Yugoslavia was not obliged to provide military assistance, nor to provide its territory for Axis to move military forces during the war. Less than two days later, after demonstrations in the streets of Belgrade, Prince Paul and the government were removed from office by a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]]. Seventeen-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] was declared to be of age. The new Yugoslav government under General [[Dušan Simović]], refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, and started negotiations with Great Britain and Soviet Union. Winston Churchill commented that &quot;Yugoslavia has found its soul&quot;; however, Hitler invaded and quickly took control.

== Anti-Comintern Pact signatories ==
Some countries signed the Anti-Comintern Pact but not the Tripartite Pact. As such their adherence to the Axis may have been less than that of Tripartite Pact signatories. Some of these states were officially at war with members of the Allied powers, others remained neutral in the war and sent only volunteers. Signing the Anti-Comintern Pact was seen as a &quot;a litmus test of loyalty&quot; by the Nazi leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goda1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goda|first1=Norman J.

===China (Reorganized National Government of China)===
{{Main|Wang Jingwei regime}}
During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Japan advanced from its bases in Manchuria to occupy much of East and Central China. Several Japanese puppet states were organized in areas occupied by the Japanese Army, including the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937–1940)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] at [[Beijing]], which was formed in 1937, and the [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]] at Nanjing, which was formed in 1938. These governments were merged into the [[Reorganized National Government of China]] at Nanjing on 29 March 1940. [[Wang Jingwei]] became head of state. The government was to be run along the same lines as the Nationalist regime and adopted its symbols.

The Nanjing Government had no real power; its main role was to act as a propaganda tool for the Japanese. The Nanjing Government concluded agreements with Japan and Manchukuo, authorising Japanese occupation of China and recognising the independence of Manchukuo under Japanese protection. The Nanjing Government signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941 and declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom on 9 January 1943.

The government had a strained relationship with the Japanese from the beginning. Wang's insistence on his regime being the true Nationalist government of China and in replicating all the symbols of the [[Kuomintang]] led to frequent conflicts with the Japanese, the most prominent being the issue of the regime's flag, which was identical to that of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

The worsening situation for Japan from 1943 onwards meant that the Nanking Army was given a more substantial role in the defence of occupied China than the Japanese had initially envisaged. The army was almost continuously employed against the communist [[New Fourth Army]].

Wang Jingwei died on 10 November 1944, and was succeeded by his deputy, [[Chen Gongbo]]. Chen had little influence; the real power behind the regime was [[Zhou Fohai]], the mayor of Shanghai. Wang's death dispelled what little legitimacy the regime had. The state stuttered on for another year and continued the display and show of a fascist regime.

On 9 September 1945, following the defeat of Japan, the area was surrendered to General [[He Yingqin]], a nationalist general loyal to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. The Nanking Army generals quickly declared their alliance to the Generalissimo, and were subsequently ordered to resist Communist attempts to fill the vacuum left by the Japanese surrender. Chen Gongbo was tried and executed in 1946.

Wang Jingwei's government signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941 but never signed the Tripartite Pact.

===Denmark===
{{Main|Occupation of Denmark }}
[[File:Flag of Denmark.svg|thumb|[[Kingdom of Denmark]]]]

Denmark was occupied by Germany after April 1940 but never joined the Axis. On 31 May 1939, Denmark and Germany signed a treaty of non-aggression, which did not contain any military obligations for either party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalhistory.dk/Danish/Historien/1939_1945/IkkeAngrebsPagt.htm &quot;Den Dansk-Tyske Ikke-Angrebstraktat af 1939&quot;]. Flådens Historie. {{in lang|da}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 9, Germany [[Operation Weserübung|attacked Scandinavia]], and the speed of the German invasion of Denmark prevented King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] and the Danish government from going into exile. They had to accept &quot;protection by the Reich&quot; and the stationing of German forces in exchange for nominal independence. Denmark coordinated its foreign policy with Germany, extending diplomatic recognition to Axis collaborator and puppet regimes, and breaking diplomatic relations with the Allied governments-in-exile. Denmark broke diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trommer&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Trommer, Aage | title=&quot;Denmark&quot;.

Langer and S. Everett Gleason, ''The Undeclared War, 1940–1941'' (1953), pp 172–73, 424–31, 575–78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Petrow, ''The Bitter Years: The Invasion and Occupation of Denmark and Norway, April 1940 – May 1945'' (1974) p 165&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 Danish Nazis set up the ''[[Frikorps Danmark]]''. Thousands of volunteers fought and many died as part of the German Army on the Eastern Front. Denmark sold agricultural and industrial products to Germany and made loans for armaments and fortifications.

{{Main|Military history of Finland during World War II}}

Although Finland never signed the Tripartite Pact, it fought against the Soviet Union alongside Germany in the 1941-44 [[Continuation War]], during which the official position of the wartime Finnish government was that Finland was a co-belligerent of the Germans who they described as &quot;brothers-in-arms&quot;.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=134}} Finland did sign the revived Anti-Comintern Pact of November 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Kent Forster, &quot;Finland's Foreign Policy 1940–1941: An Ongoing Historiographic Controversy,&quot; ''Scandinavian Studies'' (1979) 51#2 pp 109–123&lt;/ref&gt; Finland signed a [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|peace treaty]] with the Allied powers in 1947 which described Finland as having been &quot;an ally of Hitlerite Germany&quot; during the continuation war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Treaty of Peace With Finland |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435066406612&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=229&amp;q1=Finland |accessdate=23 October 2020 |page=229 |date=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The August 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol dividing much of eastern Europe and assigning Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence.{{sfn|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939}}{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=120}} After unsuccessfully attempting to force territorial and other concessions on the Finns, the Soviet Union tried to invade Finland in November 1939 during the [[Winter War]], intending to establish a communist puppet government in Finland.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|pp=120–121}}{{sfn|Kennedy-Pipe|1995|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The conflict threatened Germany's iron-ore supplies and offered the prospect of Allied interference in the region.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=123}} Despite Finnish resistance, a peace treaty was signed in March 1940, wherein Finland ceded some key territory to the Soviet Union, including the [[Karelian Isthmus]], containing Finland's second-largest city, [[Viipuri]], and the critical defensive structure of the [[Mannerheim Line]]. After this war, Finland sought protection and support from the United Kingdom{{sfn|Seppinen|1983|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}&lt;ref name=&quot;FOFinland&quot;&gt;British Foreign Office Archive, 371/24809/461-556.&lt;/ref&gt; and non-aligned Sweden,{{sfn|Jokipii|1987|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} but was thwarted by Soviet and German actions. This resulted in Finland being drawn closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories.

In the opening days of Operation Barbarossa, Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Finland permitted German planes returning from mine dropping runs over [[Kronstadt]] and [[Neva River]] to refuel at Finnish airfields before returning to bases in [[East Prussia]]. In retaliation, the Soviet Union launched a major air offensive against Finnish airfields and towns, which resulted in a Finnish declaration of war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941. The Finnish conflict with the Soviet Union is generally referred to as the [[Continuation War]].

===Henry the Navigator===
It was the genius of [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] that coordinated and utilized all these tendencies towards expansion. Prince Henry placed at the disposal of his captains the vast resources of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]], of which he was the head, and the best information and most accurate instruments and maps that could be obtained. He sought to effect a meeting with the half-fabulous Christian Empire of &quot;[[Prester John]]&quot; by way of the &quot;Western Nile&quot; (the [[Sénégal River]]), and, in alliance with that potentate, to crush the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and liberate the [[Holy Land]]. The concept of an ocean route to India appears to have originated after his death. On land he again defeated the Moors, who [[Siege of Ceuta (1418)|attempted to retake Ceuta]] in 1418; but in an [[Battle of Tangier (1437)|expedition to Tangier]], undertaken in 1437 by [[Edward of Portugal|King Edward]] (1433–1438), the Portuguese army was defeated, and could only escape destruction by surrendering as a hostage [[Fernando, the Saint Prince|Prince Ferdinand]], the king's youngest brother. Ferdinand, known as &quot;the Constant&quot;, from the fortitude with which he endured captivity, died unransomed in 1443. By sea Prince Henry's captains continued their exploration of [[Africa]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In 1433 [[Cape Bojador]] was rounded; in 1434 the first consignment of [[slaves]] was brought to [[Lisbon]]; and slave trading soon became the most profitable branch of Portuguese commerce, until India was reached. The Senegal was reached in 1445, [[Cape Verde]] was passed in the same year, and in 1446 [[Álvaro Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as [[Sierra Leone]]. This was probably the farthest point reached before the Navigator died in 1460. Another vector of the discoveries were the voyages westward, during which the Portuguese discovered the [[Sargasso Sea]] and possibly sighted the shores of [[Nova Scotia]] well before 1492.

===Portuguese in Asia===
The effort to colonize and maintain territories scattered around the entire coast of Africa and its surrounding islands, Brazil, India and Indic territories such as in [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Timor]] was a challenge for a population of only one million.
Combined with constant competition from the [[Spain|Spanish]] this led to a desire for [[secrecy]] about every trade route and every colony. As a consequence, many documents that could reach other [[Europe]]an countries were in fact fake documents with fake dates and faked facts, to mislead any other nation's possible efforts.

[[File:Ultramarinepigment.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Synthetic ultramarine [[pigment]]]]

'''Ultramarine''' is a deep [[blue]] [[color]] [[pigment]] which was originally made by grinding [[lapis lazuli]] into a [[powder]].&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of American English'', Third College Edition 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name comes from the [[Latin]] ''ultramarinus'', literally &quot;beyond the sea&quot;, because the pigment was imported into [[Europe]] from mines in [[Afghanistan]] by [[Italians|Italian]] traders during the [[14th century|14th]] and [[15th century|15th centuries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite dictionary|url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=ultramarine |title= ultramarine |dictionary= Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultramarine was the finest and most expensive blue used by [[Renaissance]] painters. It was often used for the robes of the [[Virgin Mary]], and symbolized holiness and humility.  It remained an extremely expensive pigment until a synthetic ultramarine was invented in 1826.

== Chemistry ==

The pigment consists primarily of a [[zeolite]]-based mineral containing small amounts of [[polysulfide]]s. It occurs in nature as a proximate component of [[lapis lazuli]] containing a blue cubic mineral called [[lazurite]]. In the [[Colour Index International]], the pigment of ultramarine is identified as P. Blue 29 77007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artiscreation.com/blue.html#pb29|title=The Color of Art Pigment Database: Pigment Blue - PB|work=Art is Creation|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major component of lazurite is a complex sulfur-containing sodium-silicate (Na&lt;sub&gt;8–10&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2–4&lt;/sub&gt;), which makes ultramarine the most complex of all mineral [[pigment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plesters|first=Joyce|date=1966|title=Ultramarine Blue, Natural and Artificial|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=11|issue=2|pages=62–91|doi=10.2307/1505446|jstor=1505446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[chloride]] is often present in the crystal lattice as well. The blue color of the pigment is due to the [[S3-|{{chem|S|3|-}}]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] [[anion]], which contains an [[unpaired electron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot;&gt;G. Buxbaum et al. &quot;Pigments, Inorganic, 3. Colored Pigments&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2012, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.n20_n02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
The raw materials used in the manufacture of synthetic ultramarine are the following:
* white [[kaolin]],
* [[anhydrous]] [[sodium sulfate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;),
* anhydrous [[sodium carbonate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),
* powdered [[sulfur]],
* powdered [[charcoal]] or relatively ash-free [[coal]], or [[colophony]] in lumps.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

The preparation is typically made in steps:
* The first part of the process takes place at 700 to 750&amp;nbsp;°C in a closed furnace, so that sulfur, carbon and organic substances give reducing conditions. This yields a yellow-green product sometimes used as a pigment.
* In the second step, air or sulfur dioxide at 350 to 450&amp;nbsp;°C is used to oxidise sulfide in the intermediate product to S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; [[chromophore]] molecules, resulting in the blue (or purple, pink or red) pigment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2441952.pdf|title=Manufacture of ultramarine|website=www.freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mixture is heated in a kiln, sometimes in brick-sized amounts. 
* The resultant solids are then ground and washed, as is the case in any other insoluble pigment's manufacturing process; the chemical reaction produces large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]]. ([[Flue-gas desulfurization]] is thus essential to its manufacture where SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pollution is regulated.) 

&quot;Ultramarine poor in silica&quot; is obtained by fusing a mixture of soft clay, sodium sulfate, charcoal, sodium carbonate and sulfur. The product is at first white, but soon turns green &quot;green ultramarine&quot; when it is mixed with sulfur and heated. The sulfur burns, and a fine blue pigment is obtained. &quot;Ultramarine rich in silica&quot; is generally obtained by heating a mixture of pure clay, very fine white [[sand]], sulfur and charcoal in a [[muffle furnace]]. A blue product is obtained at once, but a red tinge often results. The different ultramarines—green, blue, red and violet—are finely ground and washed with water.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

Synthetic ultramarine is a more vivid blue than natural ultramarine, since the particles in synthetic ultramarine are smaller and more uniform than the particles in natural ultramarine and therefore [[diffusion|diffuse]] light more evenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.primaryinfo.com/projects/ultramarine-blue-pigment.htm|title=Ultramarine-Blue-Pigment - Analysis, Applications, Process, Patent, Consultants, Company Profiles, Suppliers, Market, Report|website=www.primaryinfo.com|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its color is unaffected by light nor by contact with oil or lime as used in painting. [[Hydrochloric acid]] immediately bleaches it with liberation of hydrogen sulfide. Even a small addition of [[zinc oxide]] to the reddish varieties especially causes a considerable diminution in the intensity of the color.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

== Structure and classification of ultramarines ==
Ultramarine is the aluminosilicate [[zeolite]] with a [[sodalite]] structure. Sodalite consists of interconnected aluminosilicate cages. Some of these cages contain [[polysulfide]] ({{chem|S|''x''|''n''−}}) groups that are the chromophore (color centre). The negative charge on these ions is balanced by {{chem|Na|+}} ions that also occupy these cages.&lt;ref name=Ullmann /&gt;

The chromophore is proposed to be {{chem|S|4|-}} or S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot; /&gt;

== Applications ==
Synthetic ultramarine, being very cheap, is largely used for wall painting, the printing of paper hangings and calico, etc., and also as a corrective for the yellowish tinge often present in things meant to be white, such as [[linen]], [[paper]], etc. [[Bluing (fabric)|Bluing]] or &quot;Laundry blue&quot; is a suspension of synthetic ultramarine (or the chemically different [[prussian blue]]) that is used for this purpose when washing white clothes. It is also often found in make-up such as [[mascara]]s or eye shadows. Large quantities are used in the manufacture of paper, and especially for producing a kind of pale blue writing paper which was popular in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; During World War I, the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] painted the outer [[roundel]]s with a color made from Ultramarine Blue. This became BS 108(381C) Aircraft Blue. It was replaced in the 1960s by a new color made on [[Phthalocyanine Blue]], BS110(381C) Roundel Blue.

== History ==
The name derives from Middle [[Latin]] ''ultramarinus'', literally &quot;beyond the sea&quot; because it was imported from Asia by sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; In the past, it has also been known as ''azzurrum ultramarine, azzurrum transmarinum, azzuro oltramarino, azur d'Acre, pierre d'azur, Lazurstein.'' Current terminology for ultramarine includes natural ultramarine (English), ''outremer lapis'' (French), ''Ultramarin echt'' (German), ''oltremare genuino'' (Italian), and ''ultramarino verdadero'' (Spanish). The first recorded use of ''ultramarine'' as a color name in English was in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930--McGraw Hill Page 206&lt;/ref&gt;

The first noted use of ''lapis lazuli'' as a pigment can be seen in the 6th and 7th-century AD cave paintings in [[Afghanistan]]i [[Zoroastrian]] and [[Buddhist]] temples, near the most famous source of the mineral. ''Lapis lazuli'' has also been identified in Chinese paintings from the 10th and 11th centuries, in Indian mural paintings from the 11th, 12th, and 17th centuries, and on Anglo-Saxon and Norman illuminated manuscripts from c.1100.

=== In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance ===

File:Pietro Perugino cat54b.jpg|[[Pietro Perugino]] economized on this painting of the Virgin Mary (about 1500) by using [[azurite]] for the underpainting of the robe, then adding a layer of ultramarine on top.
File:Titian - Bacchus and Ariadne - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Titian]] made dramatic use of ultramarine in the sky and draperies of ''Bacchus and Ariadne'' (1520–23).
&lt;/gallery&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], ultramarine was the finest and most expensive blue that could be used by painters. The 15th century artist [[Cennino Cennini]] wrote in his painters' handbook: &quot;Ultramarine blue is a glorious, lovely and absolutely perfect pigment beyond all the pigments. It would not be possible to say anything about or do anything to it which would not make it more so.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lara Broecke, ''Cennino Cennini's ''Il Libro dell'Arte'', a New English Translation and Commentary with Italian Transcription'', Archetype 2015, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural ultramarine is the most difficult pigment to grind by hand, and for all except the highest quality of mineral, sheer grinding and washing produces only a pale grayish blue powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/palette/palette_grinding_and_materials.html#.VINmSjGG-9E|title=palette_grinding_and_materials.|publisher=www.essentialvermeer.com|access-date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The blue color&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artelisaart.blogspot.se/2012/03/famous-blue-history-of-color-in-middle.html|title=The blue color|publisher=artelisaart.blogspot.se|access-date=2014|date=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 13th century, an improved method came into use, described by Cennino Cennini in the 15th century. This process consisted of mixing the ground material with melted [[wax]], [[resin]]s, and [[oil]]s, wrapping the resulting mass in a cloth, and then kneading it in a dilute [[lye]] solution. The blue particles collect at the bottom of the pot, while the impurities and colorless crystals remain. This process was performed at least three times, with each successive extraction generating a lower quality material. The final extraction, consisting largely of colorless material as well as a few blue particles, brings forth ultramarine ash which is prized as a [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] for its pale blue transparency.&lt;ref&gt;Lara Broecke, ''Cennino Cennini's ''Il Libro dell'Arte'': a New English Translation and Commentary with Italian Transcription'', Archetype 2015, pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pigment was most extensively used during the 14th through 15th centuries, as its brilliance complemented the [[vermilion]] and [[gold]] of illuminated manuscripts and Italian panel paintings. It was valued chiefly on account of its brilliancy of tone and its inertness in opposition to sunlight, [[oil]], and slaked [[calcium oxide|lime]]. It is, however, extremely susceptible to even minute and dilute mineral [[acid]]s and acid vapors. Dilute HCl, HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rapidly destroy the blue color, producing [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) in the process. [[Acetic acid]] attacks the pigment at a much slower rate than mineral acids. Ultramarine was only used for [[fresco]]es when it was applied &quot;[[fresco-secco|secco]]&quot; because fresco's absorption rate made its use cost prohibitive. The pigment was mixed with a binding medium like egg to form a [[tempera]] and applied over dry plaster (such as [[Giotto di Bondone]]'s frescos in the [[Cappella degli Scrovegni]] or [[Arena Chapel]] in [[Padua]]).

European artists used the pigment sparingly, reserving their highest quality blues for the robes of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[Christ child]]. As a result of the high price, artists sometimes economized by using a cheaper blue, [[azurite]], for under painting. Most likely imported to Europe through [[Venice]], the pigment was seldom seen in German art or art from countries north of Italy. Due to a shortage of azurite in the late 16th and 17th century, the price for the already-expensive ultramarine increased dramatically.&lt;ref name=&quot;The blue color&quot; /&gt;

The turban of the ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Vermeer]] is painted with a mixture of ultramarine and lead white, with a thin glaze of pure ultramarine over it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girl-with-a-pearl-earring.info/palette.htm] Description of the painting at www.girl-with-a-pear-earring.info/pallette.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vermeer's ''Lady standing at a virginal'', the ultramarine pigment in the seat cushion in the foreground has deteriorated and turned paler with time.
[[Johannes Vermeer]] made extensive use of ultramarine in his paintings. In ''Lady standing at a virginal'', the young woman's dress is painted with a mixture of ultramarine and green earth, and ultramarine was also used to add shadows in the flesh tones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/meaning-of-making/vermeer-and-technique/vermeers-palette] National Gallery of London discussion of Vermeer's palette&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific analysis by the [[National Gallery]] in London of ''Lady standing at a virginal'' showed that the ultramarine in the blue seat cushion in the foreground had degraded and become paler with time; it would have been a deeper blue when originally painted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/meaning-of-making/vermeer-and-technique/altered-appearance-of-ultramarine] National Gallery essay on the altered appearance of ultramarine in the paintings of Vermeer&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century – the invention of synthetic ultramarine ===
The beginning of the development of artificial ultramarine blue was known from [[Goethe]]. In about 1787, he observed the blue deposits on the walls of lime kilns near Palermo in Italy. He was aware of the use of these glassy deposits as a substitute for lapis lazuli in decorative applications. He did not, however, mention if it was suitable to grind for a pigment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goethe |first1=Wolfgang |title=Italiensche Reise |trans-title=Italian Journey |date=1914 |publisher=Insel Verlag |location=Leipzig, Germany |page=265 |url=https://archive.org/stream/goethesitalienis00goetuoft#page/264/mode/2up |language=de}} From p. 265:  ''&quot;Doch wissen sie, außer diesen beiden, … andern kirchlichen Verzierungen mit Glück angewendet.&quot;'' (Yet they [viz, the stone cutters of Palermo] know, besides these two [types of stone], still more about a material, a product of the fire of their lime kilns.  In these is found, after roasting [the lime], a type of glassy flux, which passes from the brightest blue color to the darkest, even to the blackest.  These lumps, like other rocks, are cut into thin slabs, appraised according to the level of their color and purity, and, with luck, used instead of lapis lazuli in the inlaying of altars, tombs, and other church decorations.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsner|first1=L.|title=Chemische Untersuchung über die blaue Färbung des Ultramarins|journal=Journal für Praktische Chemie|date=1841|volume=24|pages=385–397|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101076785466;view=1up;seq=399|trans-title=Chemical investigation of the blue color of ultramarine|language=de|doi=10.1002/prac.18410240157}}  From pp. 385–386:  ''&quot;Allein es scheint weniger bekannt zu sein, … von Altären u.s.w. gebraucht würde.&quot;''  (Yet it seems to be less well known that von Göthe in the year 1787 during his stay in Palermo (see his ''Italian Journey'') cited a similar observation, as he recounted that in the Sicilian lime ovens, a product of fire, a sort of glassy flux, is found, [which is] of a light blue to dark blue color, [and] which was used as ''lapis lazuli'' by local artisans during the inlaying of altars, etc.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814, [[Tassaert family|Tassaert]] observed the spontaneous formation of a blue compound, very similar to ultramarine, if not identical with it, in a [[calcium oxide|lime]] [[kiln]] at St. Gobain,&lt;ref&gt;Tessaërt gave a sample of the pigment to the French chemist [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]] for analysis:  {{cite journal|last1=Vauquelin|title=Note sur une couleur bleue artificielle analogue à l'outremer|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|date=1814|volume=89|pages=88–91|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062722727;view=1up;seq=98|trans-title=Note on an artificial blue color similar to ultramarine|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; which caused the ''Societé pour l'Encouragement d'Industrie'' to offer, in 1824, a prize for the artificial production of the precious color. Processes were devised by [[Jean Baptiste Guimet]] (1826) and by [[Christian Gmelin]] (1828), then professor of chemistry in Tübingen; while Guimet kept his process a secret, Gmelin published his, and thus became the originator of the &quot;artificial ultramarine&quot; industry.&lt;ref&gt;See:

'''Thomas Lanier Williams III''' (March 26, 1911 – February 25, 1983), known by his [[pen name]] '''Tennessee Williams''', was an American playwright. Along with contemporaries [[Eugene O'Neill]] and [[Arthur Miller]], he is considered among the three foremost playwrights of 20th-century American drama.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book| editor-first=Harold| editor-last=Bloom| title=Tennessee Williams| publisher=Chelsea House Publishing| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G4AX9Ox0h9YC&amp;q=foremost+20th+century| isbn= 978-0877546368| year=1987| page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], after years of obscurity, at age 33 he became suddenly famous with the success of ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'' (1944) in New York City. This play closely reflected his own unhappy family background. It was the first of a string of successes, including ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1947), ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1955), ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' (1959), and ''[[The Night of the Iguana]]'' (1961). With his later work, he attempted a new style that did not appeal as widely to audiences. His drama ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' is often numbered on short lists of the finest American plays of the 20th century alongside [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]'' and [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Much of Williams' most acclaimed work has been adapted for the cinema. He also wrote short stories, poetry, essays and a volume of memoirs. In 1979, four years before his death, Williams was inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/19/archives/theater-hall-of-fame-enshrines-51-artists-great-things-and-blank.html|title=Theater Hall of Fame Enshrines 51 Artists|date=November 19, 1979|accessdate=February 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621221301/https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/19/archives/theater-hall-of-fame-enshrines-51-artists-great-things-and-blank.html|archive-date=June 21, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
[[File:Houghton - MS Thr 553 (6). Tennessee Williams age 5.jpg|alt=Tennessee Williams (age 5) in Clarksdale, MS.|thumb|Tennessee Williams (age 5) in Clarksdale, MS.]]
Thomas Lanier Williams III was born in [[Columbus, Mississippi]] of English, Welsh, and [[Huguenot]] ancestry, the second child of Edwina Dakin (August 9, 1884 – June 1, 1980) and Cornelius Coffin &quot;C. C.&quot; Williams (August 21, 1879 – March 27, 1957).&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book| editor-last=Roudané| editor-first=Matthew Charles| title=The Cambridge Companion to Tennessee Williams| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1997| url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00matt| url-access=registration| quote=edwina cornelius.| page=xvi| isbn=978-0521498838}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a traveling shoe salesman who became an alcoholic and was frequently away from home. His mother, Edwina, was the daughter of Rose O. Dakin, a music teacher, and the Reverend Walter Dakin, an Episcopal priest from Illinois who was assigned to a parish in [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]], shortly after Williams' birth.  Williams lived in his parsonage with his family for much of his early childhood and was close to his grandparents.

He had two siblings, older sister Rose Isabel Williams (1909–1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Hoare| first=Philip| title=Obituary: Rose Williams| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-rose-williams-1362925.html| work=The Independent| accessdate=December 26, 2013| location=London| date=September 12, 1996| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122203846/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-rose-williams-1362925.html| archive-date=January 22, 2014| url-status=live| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and younger brother Walter Dakin Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Cuthbert| first=David| title=Theater Guy: Remembering Dakin Williams, Tennessee's 'professional brother' and a colorful fixture at N.O.'s Tenn fest| url=http://blog.nola.com/davidcuthbert/2008/05/theater_guy_remembering_dakin.html| work=[[The Times-Picayune]]| date=May 24, 2008| accessdate=September 12, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822014611/http://blog.nola.com/davidcuthbert/2008/05/theater_guy_remembering_dakin.html| archive-date=August 22, 2017| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1919&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Tennessee Williams: Biography| url=http://wps.ablongman.com/long_kennedy_lfpd_9/22/5820/1490001.cw/index.html| work=Pearson Education| accessdate=December 26, 2013| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401203421/http://wps.ablongman.com/long_kennedy_lfpd_9/22/5820/1490001.cw/index.html| archivedate=April 1, 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;–2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Tennessee Williams' brother dead at 89| url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2008/05/21/Tennessee-Williams-brother-dead-at-89/UPI-24131211418362/| agency=[[United Press International]]| accessdate=December 26, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227010622/http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2008/05/21/Tennessee-Williams-brother-dead-at-89/UPI-24131211418362/| archive-date=December 27, 2013| url-status=live| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young child Williams nearly died from a case of [[diphtheria]] that left him weak and virtually confined to his house during a period of recuperation that lasted a year.  At least in part as a result of his illness, he was less robust as a child than his father wished.  Cornelius Williams, a descendant of hearty East Tennessee pioneer stock, had a violent temper and was a man prone to use his fists. He regarded what he thought was his son's effeminacy with disdain. Edwina, locked in an unhappy marriage, focused her attention almost entirely on her frail young son.{{sfn|Bloom|1987|page=15}}  Many critics and historians note that Williams drew from his own dysfunctional family in much of his writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

When Williams was eight years old, his father was promoted to a job at the home office of the [[International Shoe Company]] in St. Louis, Missouri. His mother's continual search for what she considered to be an appropriate address, as well as his father's heavy drinking and loudly turbulent behavior, caused them to move numerous times around St. Louis. Williams attended [[Soldan International Studies High School|Soldan High School]], a setting he referred to in his play ''The Glass Menagerie''.{{sfn|Roudané|1997|pages=11-13}} Later he studied at [[University City High School (St. Louis)|University City High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Tennessee Williams and John Waters (2006), ''Memoirs'', New Directions Publishing, 274 pages {{ISBN|0-8112-1669-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/mo/county/stlouis/williams/gen.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021053816/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/mo/county/stlouis/williams/gen.htm|url-status=dead|title=USgennet.org|archivedate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16, Williams won third prize for an essay published in ''[[Smart Set]]'', titled &quot;Can a Good Wife Be a Good Sport?&quot; A year later, his short story &quot;[[The Vengeance of Nitocris]]&quot; was published (as by &quot;Thomas Lanier Williams&quot;) in the August 1928 issue of the magazine ''[[Weird Tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Weird Tales Story| first1=Robert| last1=Weinberg| first2=E.

Later in 1928, Williams first visited Europe with his maternal grandfather Dakin.

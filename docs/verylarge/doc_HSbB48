Castles differed from earlier fortifications in that they were generally private fortified residences. Typically, a castle was the residence of a feudal lord, providing the owner with a secure base from which to control his lands,&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1962), p.172.&lt;/ref&gt; and also a symbol of wealth and power. Earlier fortified structures, such as the Saxon [[burh]] or the [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]], provided public or communal defences,&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1962), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; as did medieval town or [[Defensive wall|city walls]]. The many [[Castra|Roman forts]] of which ruins survive in Britain differed in being wholly military in nature; they were camps or strongholds of the [[Roman army]].  The Romans also built town or city walls in England, which can still be seen, for instance at [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester]].

By the 16th century the role of fortifications had changed once more with the development of artillery capable of breaching even thick stone walls. In the reign of [[Henry VIII]], fears of invasion&lt;ref&gt;Elton (1991), p.154.&lt;/ref&gt; led to the building of a series of new fortresses along the south coast of England,&lt;ref&gt;Harrington (2007), p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Device Forts]] or [[Henrician Castles]]. These were designed to use and to defend against artillery, and since they were not private residences, but national fortifications, they do not possess what architectural historians have come to see as the defining characteristics of a castle.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1962), p.128.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless they are visibly castle-like, being compact, with battlemented walls, squat turrets and sometimes a keep; and they were the last generation of fortresses in England to be known as castles, long before architectural historians began to argue that they should not be.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington (2007), p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; One of them, [[Pendennis Castle]], was one of the last Royalist strongholds to fall to the Parliamentarians during the [[English Civil War]]—starvation forcing surrender after a siege of five months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendennis Castle&quot;&gt;[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=428615 &quot;Pendennis Castle&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005185211/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=428615 |date=2012-10-05 }} PSC.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Herstmonceux Castle.JPG|thumb|[[Herstmonceux Castle]], East Sussex]]

As the role of the castle as fortress declined in the later medieval period, its role as a residence increasingly became the more important. Castles such as [[Herstmonceux Castle|Herstmonceux]] were built with fortifications seemingly designed more for show than for strength,&lt;ref name=&quot;Herst-Brown&quot;&gt;Brown (1962), p.146.&lt;/ref&gt; implying a further evolution in the role and concept of the castle, becoming less a means of enforcing power but instead a symbol of its possession, a castle becoming a grand residence proclaiming the status of its owner. Once fortifications had become altogether redundant, it became increasingly rare in England for new buildings to be described as castles, in contrast to France, where country houses continued to be known as [[château]]x.

Once no longer needed as fortresses, castles — if they were not abandoned — were, over the centuries, adapted and modernised to make them more suitable for continued use as residences:&lt;ref&gt;Creighton &amp; Higham (2003), p.64.&lt;/ref&gt; large windows were inserted in defensive walls, as at [[Lumley Castle|Lumley]]; outer walls were demolished or lowered to open up views from within, as at [[Raby Castle|Raby]]; new residential ranges were built to improve and extend accommodation, as at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]]. Some castles were restored after falling into ruin, like [[Bamburgh Castle|Bamburgh]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Bamburgh-P&quot;&gt;[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=7536 &quot;Bamburgh Castle&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006210830/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=7536 |date=2012-10-06 }} PSC.&lt;/ref&gt; others, like [[Belvoir Castle|Belvoir]], were demolished and rebuilt, retaining little or none of the original structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belvoir-P&quot;&gt;[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=323873 &quot;Belvoir Castle&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006051210/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=323873 |date=2012-10-06 }} PSC.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th and 19th centuries especially, many castles underwent &quot;improvements&quot; by architects such as [[Anthony Salvin]], and in this period a fashion developed for entirely new houses to be built in the style of castles, and to be known as castles.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1987), pp.161–163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Impey &amp; Parnell (2000), pp.118–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst these was [[Peckforton Castle]], built by Salvin: a building so authentic in its recreation of a medieval castle that it has been described as possibly the last serious fortified home built in Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peckforton&quot;&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-56862-peckforton-castle-peckforton &quot;Peckforton Castle&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710050928/http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-56862-peckforton-castle-peckforton |date=2011-07-10 }} BLB.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and exclusions==
No list of castles in England is ever likely to be complete, because there will never be complete agreement in every case as to whether the remains of a building are those of a castle, whether a given place is the site of a castle, or whether a surviving building should be considered to be a castle.&lt;ref&gt;Renn (1984) pp.277–278. See King (1988), p.173 for how some people criticised the inclusion of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII's artillery forts in King's index of castles, ''Castellarium Anglicanum''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps because the castle has become the most familiar type of fortification, many sites of fortifications earlier than the 10th century have become known as castles. Most of these are Iron Age hill forts.  Amongst the best known are [[Abbotsbury Castle]], [[Barbury Castle]], [[Bratton Castle]], [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|Cadbury Castle]], [[Castle Dore]], [[Chûn Castle]], [[Liddington Castle]], [[Maen Castle]], [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]] and [[Uffington Castle]],&lt;ref name=&quot;PSC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk|title=PastScape - information on England's archaeology and architecture|website=www.pastscape.org.uk|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426112022/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/|archivedate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst many more appear in the [[List of hill forts in England]]. Others, such as [[Melandra Castle]], [[Reculver Castle]], [[Richborough Castle]] and [[Alston, Cumbria#History|Whitley Castle]], are Roman forts, whilst [[Daw's Castle]] is a Saxon burh.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSC&quot;/&gt; None of these is included in the present list unless it is also the site of a medieval castle, as is the case with, for instance, [[Portchester Castle]], where an imposing castle was built within the surviving walls of the Roman fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porch&quot;&gt;[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=238704 &quot;Portchester Castle&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626164547/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=238704 |date=2015-06-26 }} PSC.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portchester Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1413970.jpg|thumb|[[Portchester Castle]], Hampshire: Roman walls and medieval keep]]

Nor are all medieval fortified sites included in the present list. The remains of town and city walls are excluded—most of these appear in the [[List of town walls in England and Wales]]. Also excluded are churches with defensive towers, such as [[Ancroft]], [[Burgh by Sands]], [[Edlingham]], [[Garway]], [[Great Salkeld]] and [[Newton Arlosh]], as well as other fortified ecclesiastical sites such as [[Alnwick Abbey]], [[Battle Abbey]], [[Thornton Abbey]], [[Wetheral Priory]], [[Whalley Abbey]] and [[St Mary's Abbey, York]]. Some of the pele towers of Northern England are included, but the more modest fortified buildings known as [[Bastle house|bastles]] are not, though the distinction between them is not always altogether clear. Amongst fortified manor houses, those given the title of castle are included, whilst many others were more lightly fortified and are excluded. Amongst these are [[Baddesley Clinton]], [[Cowdray House]], [[Farnhill|Farnhill Hall]], [[Hipswell|Hipswell Hall]], [[Ightham Mote]], [[Little Wenham|Little Wenham Hall]], [[Markenfield Hall]] and [[Stainton, Richmondshire|Walburn Hall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatehouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/home.html|title=Gatehouse; a Comprehensive Listing of the Medieval Fortifications of England and Wales|website=www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016045829/http://gatehouse-gazetteer.info/home.html|archivedate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list includes pele towers that became known as castles, or preserve a castle-like aspect. Many others, or their remains, survive much altered—incorporated in later country houses or farmhouses, and are excluded. Amongst these are: [[Aske Hall]], [[Biddlestone RC Chapel]], [[Bolling Hall, Bradford|Bolling Hall]], [[Bolton-on-Swale#Buildings|Bolton Old Hall]], [[Boltongate|Boltongate Rectory]], [[Causey Park House]], [[Clennell Hall]], [[Cliburn Hall]], [[Corbridge#History|Corbridge Low Hall]], [[Cartmel Fell|Cowmire Hall]], [[Beadnell|Craster Arms (Beadnell)]], [[Croglin|Croglin Old Pele]], [[Nether Denton|Denton Hall]], [[Dovenby Hall]], [[Craster|Dunstan Hall]], [[Capheaton#Landmarks|East Shaftoe Hall]], [[Bowston|Godmond Hall]], [[Great Salkeld|Great Salkeld Rectory]], [[Ellonby|Hardrigg Hall]], [[Hepscott#Landmarks|Hepscott Hall]], [[Horton, Northumberland#Landmarks|Hetton Hall]], [[Crook, Cumbria|Hollin Hall]], [[Penrith, Cumbria|Hutton Hall (Penrith)]], [[Holmrook|Irton Hall]], [[Johnby|Johnby Hall]], [[Killington, Cumbria|Killington Hall]], [[Kirkoswald, Cumbria|Kirkoswald College]], [[Levens Hall]], [[Little Harle Tower]], [[Witherslack#Landmarks|Nether Hall]], [[Netherby Hall]], [[Great Ormside|Ormside Hall]], [[Beamish, County Durham|Pockerley Pele]], [[Preston Patrick|Preston Patrick Hall]], [[Alston Moor|Randalholme Hall]], [[Rock Hall, Northumberland|Rock Hall]], [[Horsley, Northumberland#Landmarks|Rudchester Hall]], [[Beckermet#Landmarks|Sella Park]], [[Selside|Selside Hall]], [[Skelsmergh|Skelsmergh Hall]], [[Smardale|Smardale Hall]], [[Castle Sowerby|Thistlewood Farmhouse]], [[Sebergham|Warnell Hall]], [[Horton, Northumberland#Landmarks|Weetwood Hall]] and [[Witton-le-Wear#Landmarks|Witton Tower]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatehouse&quot;/&gt;

In the post-medieval period, the distinction between true castles and later [[Castle#Later use and revival castles|mock castles]] is blurred by the extent to which medieval castles were adapted and rebuilt. At [[Greystoke Castle|Greystoke]] a new castle was built incorporating a medieval pele tower;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=11310 &quot;Greystoke Castle &quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008011319/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=11310 |date=2012-10-08 }} PSC.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Tunstall, Lancashire|Thurland]] a new castle was built from the ruins of the old;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thurland-P&quot;&gt;[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=44049 &quot;Thurland Castle&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005190059/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=44049 |date=2012-10-05 }} PSC.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Belvoir Castle|Belvoir]] the old castle was demolished and a new one built.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belvoir-P&quot;/&gt; The building of mock castles might be seen as the logical conclusion of a process already apparent in castles such as [[Herstmonceux Castle|Herstmonceux]] or [[Tattershall Castle|Tattershall]], where the castle-like aspect of the building was becoming more for show than for strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herst-Brown&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Wentworth Castle, Stainborough - geograph.org.uk - 1501819.jpg|left|thumb|[[Wentworth Castle]]: not a castle but a country house]]

Amongst post-medieval buildings in England that are known as castles, a few, such as [[Peckforton Castle]], closely resemble medieval castles. Many others, such as [[Clearwell Castle]], have some castle-like features, and some, like [[Mereworth Castle]], bear no resemblance whatsoever to a castle. The list excludes buildings that neither look like castles, nor incorporate the remains of castles. Amongst these are [[Bolebroke Castle]], [[Bovey Castle]], [[Bruce Castle]], [[Castle Ashby]], [[Castle Howard]], [[Clifton-on-Yore|Clifton Castle]], [[Highclere Castle]], [[Mereworth Castle]], [[New Wardour Castle]], [[Sherborne Castle]], [[Wentworth Castle]], and [[Wisbech Castle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BLB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|title=British Listed Buildings|first=|last=|website=www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304005022/https://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/|archivedate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other buildings with some castle-like features are also excluded.

{{anchor|List of folly castles in England}}Artificial ruins and [[Folly|follies]], often built as memorials or landscape features, are also excluded.

[[File:Centre of Britain Hotel - geograph.org.uk - 12977.jpg|thumb|Red Lion Tower, Haltwhistle]]

However carefully the criteria for including a building or site on this list are set out, borderline cases are inevitable. Many buildings known to incorporate northern pele towers in their fabric, but are no longer castle-like—such as the Red Lion Tower in [[Haltwhistle]]—have been excluded. On the other hand, [[Corby Castle]], in which a pele tower survives wholly encased in a later building,&lt;ref name=&quot;Corby&quot;&gt;[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=11521 &quot;Corby Castle &quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807152626/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=11521 |date=2011-08-07 }} PSC.&lt;/ref&gt; is included because it is known as a castle, and by implication continued to fulfil the role of one, at least in part.  [[Kimbolton Castle]] is included as the site of a medieval castle, and because the present mansion has a castellated aspect in deference to the medieval castle it replaced.

'''Americas Watch''' was founded in 1981 while bloody [[civil war]]s engulfed [[Central America]]. Relying on extensive on-the-ground fact-finding, Americas Watch not only addressed perceived abuses by government forces but also applied [[international humanitarian law]] to investigate and expose [[war crime]]s by rebel groups. In addition to raising its concerns in the affected countries, Americas Watch also examined the role played by foreign governments, particularly the [[United States government]], in providing military and political support to abusive regimes.

'''Asia Watch''' (1985), '''Africa Watch''' (1988), and '''Middle East Watch''' (1989) were added to what was known as &quot;'''The Watch Committees'''&quot;. In 1988, all of these committees were united under one umbrella to form Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/75134|agency=Human Rights Watch (HRW.org)|access-date=28 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206203626/http://www.hrw.org/node/75134|archive-date=6 February 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Chauhan|first=Yamini|title=Human Rights Watch|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1459072/Human-Rights-Watch|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2014-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231513/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1459072/Human-Rights-Watch|archive-date=2013-12-02|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Profile ==
{{Primary sources|section|date=September 2017}}
Pursuant to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), Human Rights Watch (HRW) opposes violations of what are considered [[Human rights|basic human rights]] under the UDHR. This includes [[capital punishment]] and [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[LGBT social movements|sexual orientation]]. HRW advocates freedoms in connection with fundamental human rights, such as [[freedom of religion]] and [[freedom of the press]]. HRW seeks to achieve change by publicly pressuring governments and their policymakers to curb human rights abuses, and by convincing more powerful governments to use their influence on governments that violate human rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Human Rights and Humanitarian Organizations''; Edited by Thomas E. Doyle, Robert F. Gorman, Edward S. Mihalkanin; Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2016; Pg. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ&quot;/&gt;

Human Rights Watch publishes research reports on violations of [[international human rights law|international human rights norms]] as set out by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and what it perceives to be other internationally accepted, human-rights norms. These reports are used as the basis for drawing international attention to abuses and pressuring governments and international organizations to reform. Researchers conduct fact-finding missions to investigate suspect situations also using diplomacy, staying in touch with victims, making files about public and individuals, and providing required security for them in critical situations and in a proper time generate coverage in local and international [[News media|media]]. Issues raised by Human Rights Watch in its reports include social and [[discrimination|gender discrimination]], [[torture]], [[military use of children]], [[political corruption]], abuses in [[criminal justice]] systems, and the legalization of [[abortion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OH&quot; /&gt; HRW has documented and reported various violations of the laws of [[war]] and [[international humanitarian law]].

Human Rights Watch also supports writers worldwide, who are being persecuted for their work and are in need of [[Welfare (financial aid)|financial assistance]]. The Hellman/Hammett grants are financed by the estate of the playwright [[Lillian Hellman]] in funds set up in her name and that of her long-time companion, the novelist [[Dashiell Hammett]]. In addition to providing financial assistance, the Hellman/Hammett grants help raise international awareness of activists who are being silenced for speaking out in defence of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/about/info/helham.html Hellman-Hammett Grants] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001004193120/http://www.hrw.org/about/info/helham.html |date=2000-10-04 }},''Human Rights Watch''&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, Human Rights Watch presents the [[Human Rights Defenders Award]] to activists around the world who demonstrate leadership and courage in defending human rights. The award winners work closely with HRW in investigating and exposing human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Human Rights Watch|title=Five Activists Win Human Rights Watch Awards|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/09/14/five-activists-win-human-rights-watch-awards|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=23 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310131735/http://www.hrw.org/news/2008/09/14/five-activists-win-human-rights-watch-awards|archive-date=10 March 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SocialSciences.in&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=SocialSciences.in|title=Human Rights Watch|url=http://socialsciences.in/article/human-rights-watch|access-date=23 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915100739/http://www.socialsciences.in/article/human-rights-watch|archive-date=2012-09-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch was one of six international NGOs that founded the [[Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]] in 1998. It is also the co-chair of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]], a global coalition of civil society groups that successfully lobbied to introduce the [[Ottawa Treaty]], a treaty that prohibits the use of anti-personnel landmines.

Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of [[non-governmental organizations]] that monitor [[censorship]] worldwide. It also co-founded the [[Cluster Munition Coalition]], which brought about an international convention banning the weapons. HRW employs more than 275 staff—country experts, lawyers, journalists, and academics – and operates in more than 90 countries around the world. Headquartered in [[New York City]], it has offices in [[Amsterdam]], [[Beirut]], [[Berlin]], [[Brussels]], [[Chicago]], [[Geneva]], [[Johannesburg]], [[London]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Moscow]], [[Nairobi]], [[Seoul]], [[Paris]], [[San Francisco]], [[Sydney]], [[Tokyo]], [[Toronto]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Zürich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WWA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/75136|title=Who We Are|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2009-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724075720/http://www.hrw.org/en/node/75136|archive-date=2009-07-24|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRW maintains direct access to the majority of countries it reports on.

The current executive director of HRW is [[Kenneth Roth]], who has held the position since 1993. Roth conducted investigations on abuses in [[Poland]] after martial law was declared 1981. He later focused on [[Haiti]], which had just emerged from the [[Duvalier dictatorship]] but continued to be plagued with problems. Roth's awareness of the importance of human rights began with stories his father had told about escaping [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Roth graduated from [[Yale Law School]] and [[Brown University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/yale-law-school-events/national-security-turbulent-world|title=National Security in a Turbulent World - Yale Law School|website=law.yale.edu|access-date=2019-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227044547/https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/yale-law-school-events/national-security-turbulent-world|archive-date=2019-12-27|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison with Amnesty International ===
Human Rights Watch and [[Amnesty International]] are the only two Western-oriented international human rights organizations operating in most situations of severe oppression or abuse worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;SocialSciences.in&quot;/&gt; The major differences lie in the group's structure and methods for promoting change.

Amnesty International is a mass-membership organization. Mobilization of those members is the organization's central advocacy tool. Human Rights Watch's main products are its crisis-directed research and lengthy reports, whereas Amnesty International lobbies and writes detailed reports, but also focuses on mass letter-writing campaigns, adopting individuals as &quot;[[prisoners of conscience]]&quot; and lobbying for their release. Human Rights Watch will openly lobby for specific actions for other governments to take against human rights offenders, including naming specific individuals for arrest, or for [[International sanctions|sanctions]] to be levied against certain countries, recently calling for punitive sanctions against the top leaders in [[Sudan]] who have overseen a killing campaign in [[Darfur]]. The group has also called for human rights activists who have been detained in Sudan to be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnJOE4AQ00Q.html|title=Reuters.com|website=arquivo.pt|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109190851/http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnJOE4AQ00Q.html|archive-date=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its documentations of human rights abuses often include extensive analyses of the political and historical backgrounds of the conflicts concerned, some of which have been published in academic journals. AI's reports, on the other hand, tend to contain lesser analyses, and instead focus on specific abuses of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wiley-Blackwell encyclopedia of globalization|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Ritzer, George., Wiley-Blackwell (Firm)|isbn=9781405188241|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=748577872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, ''[[The Times]]'' of London wrote that HRW has &quot;all but eclipsed&quot; Amnesty International. According to ''The Times'', instead of being supported by a mass membership, as AI is, HRW depends on wealthy donors who like to see the organization's reports make headlines. For this reason, according to ''The Times'', HRW tends to &quot;concentrate too much on places that the media already cares about&quot;, especially in disproportionate coverage of Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nazi scandal engulfs Human Rights Watch&quot; &gt;[http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/ngo_monitor_research_featured_in_sunday_times_nazi_scandal_engulfs_human_rights_watch_ NGO Monitor research featured in Sunday Times: &quot;Nazi scandal engulfs Human Rights Watch&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102075827/http://ngo-monitor.org/article/ngo_monitor_research_featured_in_sunday_times_nazi_scandal_engulfs_human_rights_watch_ |date=2016-01-02 }}, March 28, 2010.

Financier and philanthropist [[George Soros]] of the [[Open Society Institute|Open Society Foundation]] announced in 2010 his intention to grant US$100 million to HRW over a period of ten years to help it expand its efforts internationally: &quot;to be more effective,&quot; he said, &quot;I think the organization has to be seen as more international, less an American organization.&quot; He said, &quot;Human Rights Watch is one of the most effective organizations I support.

In the summer of 2004, the [[Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] at [[Columbia University]] in New York became the depository institution for the Human Rights Watch Archive, an active collection that documents decades of human rights investigations around the world. The archive was transferred from its previous location at the Norlin Library at the [[University of Colorado, Boulder]]. The archive includes administrative files, public relations documents, as well as case and country files. With some exceptions for security considerations, the Columbia University community and the public have access to field notes, taped and transcribed interviews with alleged victims of human rights violations, video and audiotapes, and other materials documenting the organization's activities since its founding in 1978 as Helsinki Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2004/03/ljarchives/human-rights-watch-archive-moves-to-columbia-university/|title=Human Rights Watch Archive Moves to Columbia University|website=lj.libraryjournal.com|access-date=2014-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714213843/http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2004/03/ljarchives/human-rights-watch-archive-moves-to-columbia-university/|archive-date=2014-07-14|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, significant parts of the HRW archive are not open to researchers or to the public, including the records of the meetings of the board of directors, the executive committee, and the various subcommittees, limiting historians' ability to understand the organization's internal decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Slezkine, Peter, &quot;[http://humanityjournal.org/issue-5-3/from-helsinki-to-human-rights-watch-how-an-american-cold-war-monitoring-group-became-an-international-human-rights-institution/ From Helsinki to Human Rights Watch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227195228/http://humanityjournal.org/issue-5-3/from-helsinki-to-human-rights-watch-how-an-american-cold-war-monitoring-group-became-an-international-human-rights-institution/ |date=2019-12-27 }},&quot; Humanity (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Criticism of Human Rights Watch}}
HRW has been criticized for perceived bias by the national governments it has investigated for human rights abuses,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/world/middleeast/egypt-human-rights-watch-muslim-brotherhood.html After Human Rights Watch Report, Egypt Says Group Broke Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620153350/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/world/middleeast/egypt-human-rights-watch-muslim-brotherhood.html |date=2018-06-20 }}&quot;.

HRW has routinely publicly addressed, and often denies, criticism of its reporting and findings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knuckey&quot;&gt;''The Transformation of Human Rights Fact-Finding''; Sarah Knuckey; [[Oxford University Press]], 2015; Pgs. 355-376&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Democracy Now, HRW has also been criticized for having a 'revolving door' with the U.S. government, a charge which HRW disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.democracynow.org/2014/6/11/debate_is_human_rights_watch_too Is Human Rights Watch Too Close to U.S. Gov't to Criticize Its Foreign Policy?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018002942/https://www.democracynow.org/2014/6/11/debate_is_human_rights_watch_too |date=2019-10-18 }}; June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, the HRW Board of Directors discovered that Human Rights Watch accepted a $470,000 donation from Saudi real estate magnate Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber, owner of a company HRW &quot;had previously identified as complicit in labor rights abuse&quot;, under the condition that the donation not be used to support LGBT advocacy in the Middle East and North Africa. The gift was returned and Human Rights Watch issued a statement saying that accepting the funding was a “deeply regrettable decision” in response to investigative reporting from The Intercept regarding the donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2020/03/02/human-rights-watch-took-money-from-saudi-businessman-after-documenting-his-coercive-labor-practices/|title=Human Rights Watch Took Money From Saudi Businessman After Documenting His Coercive Labor Practices|first=Alex|last=Emmons|date=March 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard II''' (6 January 1367&amp;nbsp;– c. 14 February 1400), also known as '''Richard of Bordeaux''', was [[King of England]] from 1377 until he was [[List of deposed politicians|deposed]] in 1399. Richard's father, [[Edward the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]], died in 1376, leaving Richard as [[heir apparent]] to his grandfather, [[King Edward III]]. Upon the death of Edward III, the 10-year-old Richard succeeded to the throne.

During Richard's first years as king, government was in the hands of a series of [[regency]] councils, influenced by Richard's uncles [[John of Gaunt]] and [[Thomas of Woodstock]]. [[Kingdom of England|England]] then faced various problems, most notably the [[Hundred Years' War]]. A major challenge of the reign was the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381, and the young king played a central part in the successful suppression of this crisis. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to bring an end to the Hundred Years' War. A firm believer in the [[royal prerogative]], Richard restrained the power of the aristocracy and relied on a private [[retinue]] for military protection instead. In contrast to his grandfather, Richard cultivated a refined atmosphere at court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.

The king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the [[Lords Appellant]]. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents. In 1397, he took his revenge on the Appellants, many of whom were executed or exiled. The next two years have been described by historians as Richard's &quot;tyranny&quot;. In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, the king disinherited Gaunt's son, [[Henry Bolingbroke]], who had previously been exiled. Henry invaded England in June 1399 with a small force that quickly grew in numbers. Meeting little resistance, he deposed Richard and had himself crowned king. Richard is thought to have been starved to death in captivity, although questions remain regarding his final fate.

Richard's posthumous reputation has been shaped to a large extent by [[William Shakespeare]], whose play ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition as responsible for the 15th-century [[Wars of the Roses]]. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as many historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had a [[personality disorder]], particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that his policies were not unrealistic or even entirely unprecedented, but that the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, leading to his downfall.

== Early life ==
[[File:Edward III Black Prince 14thc.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Edward, Prince of Wales, kneeling before his father, King Edward III]]

Richard of Bordeaux was the younger son of [[Edward the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]], and [[Joan, Countess of Kent]]. Edward, eldest son of [[Edward III]] and [[heir apparent]] to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the [[Hundred Years' War]], particularly in the [[Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted [[dysentery]] in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Barber|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Barber|title=Edward, prince of Wales and of Aquitaine (1330–1376)|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/8523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard was born at the Archbishop's Palace, [[Bordeaux]], in the English principality of [[Duchy of Aquitaine#Hundred Years' War|Aquitaine]], on 6 January 1367. According to contemporary sources, three kings{{spaced ndash}}&quot;the King of [[Crown of Castile|Castille]], the King of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and the King of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]&quot;{{spaced ndash}}were present at his birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;&gt;Tuck (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; This anecdote, and the fact that his birth fell on the feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], was later used in the religious imagery of the [[Wilton Diptych]], where Richard is one of three kings paying homage to the [[Virgin and Child]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nLbAoxCCt8YC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=Wilton+Diptych+Epiphany&amp;sig=ACfU3U3LS79tMWmk13QHWga0pDPkxuoCkQ Gillespie and Goodman (1998), p. 266].&lt;/ref&gt; His elder brother, [[Edward of Angoulême]], died near his sixth birthday in 1371.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince of Wales finally succumbed to his long illness in June 1376. The [[House of Commons of England|Commons]] in the [[English Parliament]] genuinely feared that Richard's uncle, [[John of Gaunt]], would [[usurp]] the throne.{{Ref label|A|a|none}} For this reason, Richard was quickly invested with the [[princedom of Wales]] and his father's other titles.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coronation Richard2 England 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Coronation of Richard II aged ten in 1377, from the ''Recueil des croniques'' of [[Jean de Wavrin]]. [[British Library]], London.]]

On 21 June the next year, Richard's grandfather King Edward III, who was for some years frail and decrepit, died after a 50-year reign. This resulted in the 10-year-old Richard succeeding to the throne. He was [[Coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] on 16 July 1377 at Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, fears of John of Gaunt's ambitions influenced political decisions, and a regency led by the king's uncles was avoided.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 399–400.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the king was nominally to exercise kingship with the help of a series of &quot;continual councils&quot;, from which Gaunt was excluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; Gaunt, together with his younger brother [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham]], still held great informal influence over the business of government, but the king's councillors and friends, particularly Sir [[Simon de Burley]] and [[Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford]], increasingly gained control of royal affairs. In a matter of three years, these councillors earned the mistrust of the Commons to the point that the councils were discontinued in 1380.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; Contributing to discontent was an increasingly heavy burden of [[Taxation in medieval England|taxation]] levied through three [[poll tax]]es between 1377 and 1381 that were spent on unsuccessful military expeditions on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), pp. 445–6.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1381, there was a deep-felt resentment against the governing classes in the lower levels of English society.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), pp. 229–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peasants' Revolt ==
[[File:Death of Wat Tyler Froissart.jpg|thumb|right|Richard II watches [[Wat Tyler]]'s death and addresses the peasants in the background: taken from the [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|Gruuthuse manuscript]] of [[Froissart]]'s ''Chroniques'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1475)]]

Whereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the [[Peasants' Revolt]], the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]] and [[Second plague pandemic|subsequent outbreaks]] of the plague.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; The rebellion started in [[Kent]] and [[Essex]] in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] near London under the leaders [[Wat Tyler]], [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]], and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]. John of Gaunt's [[Savoy Palace]] was burnt down. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Simon Sudbury]], who was also [[Lord Chancellor]], and [[Lord High Treasurer]] [[Robert Hales]] were both killed by the rebels,&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2006), pp. 230–1.&lt;/ref&gt; who were demanding the complete abolition of [[serfdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;H231&quot;&gt;Harriss (2006), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, sheltered within the [[Tower of London]] with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; The king set out by the [[River Thames]] on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at [[Greenwich]] made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at [[Mile End]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 68–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and [[William Walworth]], the [[Lord Mayor of London]], pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 70–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying &quot;I am your captain, follow me!&quot;, he led the mob away from the scene.{{Ref label|B|b|none}} Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 413–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at [[Billericay]], he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt.&lt;ref name=&quot;H231&quot;/&gt; Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt;

== Coming of age ==
[[File:Richard2 Anna.jpg|thumb|upright|Anne and Richard's coronation in the ''[[Liber Regalis]]'' of [[Westminster Abbey]]]]

It is only with the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the [[chronicle|annals]].&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry [[Anne of Bohemia]], daughter of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], on 20 January 1382.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 90. The marriage had been agreed upon as of 2 May 1381; Saul (1997), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; It had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the [[Western Schism]], Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] in the ongoing Hundred Years' War.{{Ref label|C|c|none}} Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 94–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Michael de la Pole]] had been instrumental in the marriage negotiations;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 117–20.&lt;/ref&gt; De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family.&lt;ref&gt;A complaint in parliament claimed that he had been &quot;raised from low estate to the rank of earl&quot;; Saul (1997), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; When Richard made him chancellor in 1383, and created him [[Earl of Suffolk]] two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of the close circle around the king was Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who in this period emerged as the king's [[favourite]].&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of [[Duke of Ireland]] in 1386.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 425, 442–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicler [[Thomas Walsingham]] suggested the relationship between the king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions came to a head over the approach to the war in France. While the court party preferred negotiations, Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large-scale campaign to protect English possessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; Instead, a so-called [[crusade]] led by [[Henry le Despenser]], [[Bishop of Norwich]], was dispatched, which failed miserably.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; Faced with this setback on the continent, Richard turned his attention instead towards France's ally, [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. In 1385, the king himself led a [[English invasion of Scotland (1385)|punitive expedition to the north]],&lt;ref&gt;Muster of the 1385 army [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVFIAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=archaeologia+1829&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Ellis, Nicolas, Nicolas Harris, 'Richard II's army for Scotland, 1385', in ''Archaeologia'', vol. 22, (1829), 13–19]&lt;/ref&gt; but the effort came to nothing, and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 142–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, only an uprising in [[Ghent]] prevented a French invasion of southern England.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 145–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure, and Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; With Gaunt gone, the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the king and his courtiers passed to Buckingham{{spaced ndash}}who had by now been created Duke of Gloucester{{spaced ndash}}and [[Richard Fitzalan, 4th Earl of Arundel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt;

The threat of a French invasion did not subside, but instead grew stronger into 1386.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Pole{{spaced ndash}}in his capacity of chancellor{{spaced ndash}}requested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament (later known as the [[Wonderful Parliament]]) was presumably working with the support of Gloucester and Arundel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a [[scullery maid|scullion]] from his kitchen at parliament's request.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 157–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard was deeply perturbed by this affront to his royal prerogative, and from February to November 1387 went on a &quot;gyration&quot; (tour) of the country to muster support for his cause.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; By installing de Vere as [[Justice of Chester]], he began the work of creating a loyal military power base in [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1971), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He also secured a legal ruling from [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice]] [[Robert Tresilian]] that parliament's conduct had been unlawful and treasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chrimes|first=S.

__NOTOC__
Year '''308''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCVIII]]''') was a [[leap year starting on Thursday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Valerius and Valerius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1061 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 308 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''William III''' (William Henry; {{lang-nl|Willem Hendrik}}; 4 November 1650{{spnd}}8 March 1702),{{efn|name=OSNS}} also widely known as '''William of Orange''', was sovereign [[Principality of Orange|Prince of Orange]] from birth, [[Stadtholder]] of [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]], [[Lordship of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Guelders]] and [[Lordship of Overijssel|Overijssel]] in the [[Dutch Republic]] from the 1670s and King of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] from 1689 until his death. As King of Scotland, he is known as '''William II'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_03_revolution.html|title=Act of Union 1707, the Revolution in Scotland|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=8 August 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080615023245/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_03_revolution.html| archivedate = 15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes informally known as &quot;King Billy&quot; in [[Ireland]] and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Varieties of Cultural History |url=https://archive.org/details/varietiescultura00burk |url-access=limited |author=Peter Burke |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1997 |page=[https://archive.org/details/varietiescultura00burk/page/n61 51] |isbn=0-8014-8492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His victory at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690 is [[The Twelfth|commemorated]] by [[Unionism in the United Kingdom|unionists]], who display [[Orange Order|orange colours]] in his honour. Popular histories usually refer to his joint reign with his wife, Queen [[Mary II]], as that of ''William and Mary''.

William was the only child of [[William II, Prince of Orange]], who died a week before his birth, and [[Mary, Princess of Orange]], the daughter of King [[Charles I of England, Scotland, and Ireland]]. In 1677, during the reign of his uncle King [[Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland]], he married his cousin Mary, the fifteen-year-old daughter of his maternal uncle [[James, Duke of York]]. A [[Protestant]], William participated in several wars against the powerful [[Catholic]] King [[Louis XIV of France]], in coalition with both Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe. Many Protestants heralded him as a champion of their faith. In 1685, his Catholic uncle and father-in-law, James, became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. James's reign was unpopular with the Protestant majority in Britain, who feared a revival of Catholicism. Supported by a group of influential British political and religious leaders, William invaded England in what became known as the [[Glorious Revolution]]. In 1688, he landed at the south-western English port of [[Brixham]]. Shortly afterwards, James was deposed.

William's reputation as a staunch Protestant enabled him and his wife to take power. During the early years of his reign, William was occupied abroad with the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688–97), leaving Mary to govern the kingdom alone. She died in 1694. In 1696, the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] [[Jacobite assassination plot 1696|plotted unsuccessfully]] to assassinate William and return his father-in-law to the throne. William's lack of children and the death in 1700 of his nephew [[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]], the son of his sister-in-law [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], threatened the Protestant succession. The danger was averted by placing distant relatives, the Protestant [[Hanoverians]], in line to the throne with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]]. Upon his death in 1702, the king was succeeded in Britain by Anne and as titular Prince of Orange by his cousin, [[John William Friso]].

==Early life==

===Birth and family===
[[File:Portret van Willem II (1626-50), prins van Oranje, en zijn echtgenote Maria Stuart (1631-60) Rijksmuseum SK-A-871.jpeg|thumb|alt=Portrait of Mary, Princess Royal, in a yellow gown and William II in a black suit|upright|William's parents, [[William II, Prince of Orange]], and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary, Princess Royal]], 1647]]

William III was born in [[The Hague]] in the [[Dutch Republic]] on 4 November 1650.{{efn|name=OSNS}}&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Baptised William Henry ({{lang-nl|Willem Hendrik}}), he was the only child of [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary, Princess Royal]] and [[stadtholder]] [[William II, Prince of Orange]]. His mother was the eldest daughter of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland]] and sister of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and [[King James II and VII]].

Eight days before William was born, his father died of [[smallpox]]; thus William was the sovereign [[Prince of Orange]] from the moment of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 14&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately, a conflict ensued between his mother and paternal grandmother, [[Amalia of Solms-Braunfels]], over the name to be given to the infant. Mary wanted to name him Charles after her brother, but her mother-in-law insisted on giving him the name William (''Willem'') to bolster his prospects of becoming stadtholder.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26; van der Zee, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; William II had appointed his wife as their son's guardian in his will; however, the document remained unsigned at William II's death and was void.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 1651, the ''[[Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland]]'' (Supreme Court) ruled that guardianship would be shared between his mother, his paternal grandmother and [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], whose wife, [[Louise Henriette of Nassau|Louise Henriette]], was William II's eldest sister.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26–27. The Prussian prince was chosen because he could act as a neutral party mediating between the two women, but also because as a possible heir he was interested in protecting the Orange family fortune, which Amalia feared Mary would squander.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and education===
William's mother showed little personal interest in her son, sometimes being absent for years, and had always deliberately kept herself apart from Dutch society.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 5–6; Troost, 27&lt;/ref&gt; William's education was first laid in the hands of several Dutch governesses, some of English descent, including Walburg Howard&lt;ref name=t3437/&gt; and the Scottish noblewoman, Lady [[Anna Mackenzie]].&lt;ref name=odnbanna&gt;Rosalind K. Marshall, 'Mackenzie, Anna, countess of Balcarres and countess of Argyll (c.1621–1707)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4467, accessed 29 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; From April 1656, the prince received daily instruction in the [[Reformed churches|Reformed religion]] from the [[Calvinist]] preacher Cornelis Trigland, a follower of the [[Franciscus Gomarus|Contra-Remonstrant]] theologian [[Gisbertus Voetius]].&lt;ref name=t3437&gt;Troost, 34–37&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ideal education for William was described in ''Discours sur la nourriture de S. H. Monseigneur le Prince d'Orange'', a short treatise, perhaps by one of William's tutors, [[Constantijn Huygens]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 27. The author may also have been [[Johan van den Kerckhoven]]. ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; In these lessons, the prince was taught that he was [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestined]] to become an instrument of [[Divine Providence]], fulfilling the historical destiny of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan davids de heem-fleurs avec portrait guillaume III d'Orange.jpg|thumb|The young prince portrayed by [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]] and [[Jan Vermeer van Utrecht]] within a flower garland filled with symbols of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], c. 1660]]

From early 1659, William spent seven years at the [[University of Leiden]] for a formal education, under the guidance of ethics professor Hendrik Bornius (though never officially enrolling as a student).&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 37–40&lt;/ref&gt; While residing in the ''Prinsenhof'' at [[Delft]], William had a small personal retinue including [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|Hans Willem Bentinck]], and a new governor, [[Frederick Nassau de Zuylenstein]], who (as an illegitimate son of stadtholder [[Frederick Henry of Orange]]) was his paternal uncle.

[[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] and his uncle [[Cornelis de Graeff]] pushed the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] to take charge of William's education and ensure that he would acquire the skills to serve in a future—though undetermined—state function; the States acted on 25 September 1660.&lt;ref name=troost43&gt;Troost, 43&lt;/ref&gt; This first involvement of the authorities did not last long. On 23 December 1660, when William was ten years old, his mother died of [[smallpox]] at [[Whitehall Palace]], London, while visiting her brother, the recently restored King Charles II.&lt;ref name=troost43/&gt; In her will, Mary requested that Charles look after William's interests, and Charles now demanded that the States of Holland end their interference.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; To appease Charles, they complied on 30 September 1661.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 44&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Zuylenstein began to work for Charles and induced William to write letters to his uncle asking him to help William become stadtholder someday.&lt;ref name=troost49&gt;Troost, 49&lt;/ref&gt; After his mother's death, William's education and guardianship became a point of contention between [[Orangism (Netherlands)|his dynasty's supporters]] and the advocates of a more republican Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 12–17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch authorities did their best at first to ignore these intrigues, but in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] one of Charles's peace conditions was the improvement of the position of his nephew.&lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; As a countermeasure in 1666, when William was sixteen, the States officially made him a ward of the government, or a &quot;Child of State&quot;.&lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; All pro-English courtiers, including Zuylenstein, were removed from William's company.&lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; William begged De Witt to allow Zuylenstein to stay, but he refused.&lt;ref name=vdk14&gt;Van der Kiste, 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; De Witt, the leading politician of the Republic, took William's education into his own hands, instructing him weekly in state matters and joining him for regular games of [[real tennis]].&lt;ref name=vdk14/&gt;

==Early offices==

[[File:Gaspar Fagel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=portrait of a plump man standing at a desk with papers lying on it|[[Gaspar Fagel]] replaced De Witt as Grand Pensionary, and was more friendly to William's interests.]]

===Exclusion from stadtholdership===
{{Main|First Stadtholderless Period}}

After the death of William's father, most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant.&lt;ref&gt;In the province of [[Friesland]] that office was filled by William's uncle-by-marriage [[William Frederick, Prince of Nassau-Dietz]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the demand of [[Oliver Cromwell]], the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Treaty of Westminster]], which ended the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], had a secret annexe that required the [[Act of Seclusion]], which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[English Restoration]], the Act of Seclusion, which had not remained a secret for long, was declared void as the [[English Commonwealth]] (with which the treaty had been concluded) no longer existed.&lt;ref name=troost41&gt;Troost, 41&lt;/ref&gt; In 1660, Mary and Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused.&lt;ref name=troost41/&gt;

In 1667, as William III approached the age of 18, the [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangist party]] again attempted to bring him to power by securing for him the offices of stadtholder and [[Captain-General]]. To prevent the restoration of the influence of the House of Orange, De Witt, the leader of the [[Dutch States Party|States Party]], allowed the [[pensionary]] of [[Haarlem]], [[Gaspar Fagel]], to induce the States of Holland to issue the [[Perpetual Edict (1667)|Perpetual Edict]].&lt;ref name=troost52&gt;Troost, 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; The Edict declared that the Captain-General or Admiral-General of the Netherlands could not serve as stadtholder in any province.&lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; Even so, William's supporters sought ways to enhance his prestige and, on 19 September 1668, the [[States of Zeeland]] appointed him as ''First Noble''.&lt;ref name=vdk16&gt;Van der Kiste, 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; To receive this honour, William had to escape the attention of his state tutors and travel secretly to [[Middelburg]].&lt;ref name=vdk16/&gt; A month later, Amalia allowed William to manage his own household and declared him to be of majority age.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The province of Holland, the centre of anti-Orangism, abolished the office of stadtholder and four other provinces followed suit in March 1670, establishing the so-called &quot;Harmony&quot;.&lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; De Witt demanded an oath from each Holland [[regenten|regent]] (city council member) to uphold the Edict; all but one complied.&lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; William saw all this as a defeat, but the arrangement was a compromise: De Witt would have preferred to ignore the prince completely, but now his eventual rise to the office of supreme army commander was implicit.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; De Witt further conceded that William would be admitted as a member of the ''[[Council of State of the Netherlands|Raad van State]]'', the Council of State, then the [[Generality (Netherlands)|generality]] organ administering the defence budget.&lt;ref name=troost59&gt;Troost, 59&lt;/ref&gt; William was introduced to the council on 31 May 1670 with full voting rights, despite De Witt's attempts to limit his role to that of an advisor.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with republicans===
In November 1670, William obtained permission to travel to England to urge Charles to pay back at least a part of the 2,797,859&amp;nbsp;[[Dutch guilder|guilder]] debt the House of Stuart owed the House of Orange.&lt;ref name=troost62&gt;Troost, 62–64&lt;/ref&gt; Charles was unable to pay, but William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1,800,000 guilders.&lt;ref name=troost62/&gt; Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated [[Calvinist]] and patriotic Dutchman, and reconsidered his desire to show him the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as &quot;sovereign&quot; of a Dutch [[rump state]].&lt;ref name=troost62/&gt; In addition to differing political outlooks, William found that his lifestyle differed from his uncles, Charles and James, who were more concerned with drinking, gambling, and cavorting with mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the Republic's security deteriorated quickly as an Anglo-French attack became imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 64&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the threat, the States of [[Gelderland]] wanted William to be appointed Captain-General of the [[Dutch States Army]] as soon as possible, despite his youth and inexperience.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 65&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 1671, the States of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] made this their official policy.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 66&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 January 1672, the States of [[Holland]] made a counterproposal: to appoint William for just a single campaign.&lt;ref name=troost67&gt;Troost, 67&lt;/ref&gt; The prince refused this and on 25 February a compromise was reached: an appointment by the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] for one summer, followed by a permanent appointment on his 22nd birthday.&lt;ref name=troost67/&gt;

Meanwhile, William had written a secret letter to Charles in January 1672 asking his uncle to exploit the situation by exerting pressure on the States to appoint William stadtholder.&lt;ref name=troost65&gt;Troost, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; In return, William would ally the Republic with England and serve Charles's interests as much as his &quot;honour and the loyalty due to this state&quot; allowed.&lt;ref name=troost65/&gt; Charles took no action on the proposal, and continued his war plans with his French ally.

==Becoming stadtholder==

===&quot;Disaster year&quot;: 1672===
{{Main|Rampjaar}}
[[File:Johannes Voorhout - Willem III te paard -1670-2.jpg|thumb|Equestrian portrait by [[Johannes Voorhout]]]]

For the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous. It became known as the ''[[Rampjaar]]'' (&quot;disaster year&quot;), because in the [[Franco-Dutch War]] and the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies: England, [[Bishopric of Münster|Münster]], and [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]]. Although the Anglo-French fleet was disabled by the [[Battle of Solebay]], in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht. On 14 June, William withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland, where the States had ordered the flooding of the [[Dutch Water Line]] on 8 June.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 74&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis XIV of France]], believing the war was over, began negotiations to extract as large a sum of money from the Dutch as possible.&lt;ref name=troost78&gt;Troost, 78–83&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against De Witt and his allies.&lt;ref name=troost78/&gt;

On 4 July, the States of Holland appointed William stadtholder, and he took the oath five days later.&lt;ref name=troost76&gt;Troost, 76&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a special envoy from Charles II, [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], met William in [[Nieuwerbrug]] and presented a proposal from Charles. In return for William's capitulation to England and France, Charles would make William Sovereign Prince of Holland, instead of stadtholder (a mere civil servant).&lt;ref name=troost80&gt;Troost, 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; When William refused, Arlington threatened that William would witness the end of the Republic's existence.&lt;ref name=troost80/&gt; William answered famously: &quot;There is one way to avoid this: to die defending it in the last ditch.&quot; On 7 July, the inundations were complete and the further advance of the French army was effectively blocked. On 16 July, Zeeland offered the stadtholdership to William.&lt;ref name=troost76/&gt;

Johan de Witt had been unable to function as [[Grand Pensionary]] after being wounded by an attempt on his life on 21 June.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 75&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August, William published a letter from Charles, in which the English king stated that he had made war because of the aggression of the De Witt faction.&lt;ref name=troost85&gt;Troost, 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; The people thus incited, De Witt and his brother, [[Cornelis de Witt|Cornelis]], were [[Johan de Witt#Year of Disaster|brutally murdered]] by an Orangist [[civil militia]] in The Hague on 20 August.&lt;ref name=troost85/&gt; Subsequently, William replaced many of the Dutch regents with his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Recapture of Naarden by William III in 1673 -Belegeringe der Stadt Naerden (Romeyn de Hooghe).jpg|thumb|left|Recapture of [[Naarden]] by William of Orange in 1673]]

Though William's complicity in the lynching has never been proved (and some 19th-century Dutch historians have made an effort to disprove that he was an accessory) he thwarted attempts to prosecute the ringleaders, and even rewarded some, like [[Hendrik Verhoeff]], with money, and others, like [[Johan van Banchem]] and [[Johan Kievit]], with high offices.&lt;ref&gt;Rowen, H.

Tweede Deel'', pp. 92–93, and fn.4 p. 92; [[Robert Fruin|Fruin, Robert]], [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_gid001186701_01/_gid001186701_01_0008.php &quot;De schuld van Willem III en zijn vrienden aan den moord der gebroeders de Witt&quot;], in ''De Gids'' (1867), pp. 201–218&lt;/ref&gt; This damaged his reputation in the same fashion as his later [[Massacre of Glencoe|actions at Glencoe]].

William continued to fight against the invaders from England and France, allying himself with Spain and [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. In November 1672, he took his army to [[Maastricht]] to threaten the French supply lines.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 122&lt;/ref&gt; By 1673, the Dutch situation further improved. Although Louis took Maastricht and William's attack against [[Charleroi]] failed, [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] [[Michiel de Ruyter]] defeated the Anglo-French fleet three times, forcing Charles to end England's involvement by the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]]; after 1673, France slowly withdrew from Dutch territory (with the exception of Maastricht), while making gains elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;

Fagel now proposed to treat the liberated provinces of Utrecht, Gelderland and [[Overijssel]] as conquered territory ([[Generality Lands]]), as punishment for their quick surrender to the enemy.&lt;ref name=troost106&gt;Troost, 106–110&lt;/ref&gt; William refused but obtained a special mandate from the States General to appoint all delegates in the States of these provinces anew.&lt;ref name=troost106/&gt; William's followers in the States of Utrecht on 26 April 1674 appointed him hereditary stadtholder.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 109&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 1675, the States of Gelderland offered him the titles of Duke of [[Guelders]] and [[Zutphen County|Count of Zutphen]].&lt;ref name=troost109&gt;Troost, 109–112&lt;/ref&gt; The negative reactions to this from Zeeland and the city of Amsterdam made William ultimately decide to decline these honours; he was instead appointed stadtholder of Gelderland and Overijssel.&lt;ref name=troost109/&gt;

===Marriage===
[[File:Lely Queen Mary II.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of Mary with brown hair and in a blue-and-gray dress|William married his first cousin, the future [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]], in 1677.]]

During the war with France, William tried to improve his position by marrying, in 1677, his first cousin [[Mary II of England|Mary]], elder surviving daughter of the Duke of York, later King James II of England (James VII of Scotland). Mary was eleven years his junior and he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother (another Mary Stuart), but William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles's kingdoms, and would draw England's monarch away from his pro-French policies.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; James was not inclined to consent, but Charles II pressured his brother to agree.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Charles wanted to use the possibility of marriage to gain leverage in negotiations relating to the war, but William insisted that the two issues be decided separately.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; Charles relented, and Bishop [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]] married the couple on 4 November 1677.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Mary became pregnant soon after the marriage, but [[miscarried]]. After a further illness later in 1678, she never conceived again.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, 86–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout William and Mary's marriage, William had only one reputed mistress, [[Elizabeth Hamilton, Countess of Orkney|Elizabeth Villiers]], in contrast to the many mistresses his uncles openly kept.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 202–206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace with France, intrigue with England===
By 1678, Louis sought peace with the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 141–145&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, tensions remained: William remained suspicious of Louis, thinking that the French king desired &quot;Universal Kingship&quot; over Europe; Louis described William as &quot;my mortal enemy&quot; and saw him as an obnoxious warmonger. France's annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany (the ''[[Chambers of Reunion|Réunion]]'' policy) and the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, caused a surge of [[Huguenot]] refugees to the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 153–156&lt;/ref&gt; This led William III to join various anti-French alliances, such as the Association League, and ultimately the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|League of Augsburg]] (an anti-French coalition that also included the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Sweden, Spain and several German states) in 1686.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 156–163&lt;/ref&gt;

After his marriage in November 1677, William became a strong candidate for the English throne should his father-in-law (and uncle) James be excluded because of his Catholicism. During the crisis concerning the [[Exclusion Bill]] in 1680, Charles at first invited William to come to England to bolster the king's position against the exclusionists, then withdrew his invitation—after which [[Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] also tried unsuccessfully to bring William over, but now to put pressure on Charles.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, William secretly induced the States General to send Charles the &quot;Insinuation&quot;, a plea beseeching the king to prevent any Catholics from succeeding him, without explicitly naming James.&lt;ref name=troost152&gt;Troost, 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving indignant reactions from Charles and James, William denied any involvement.&lt;ref name=troost152/&gt;

In 1685, when James II succeeded Charles, William at first attempted a conciliatory approach, at the same time trying not to offend the Protestants in England.&lt;ref name=troost173&gt;Troost, 173–175&lt;/ref&gt; William, ever looking for ways to diminish the power of France, hoped that James would join the League of Augsburg, but by 1687 it became clear that James would not join the anti-French alliance.&lt;ref name=troost173/&gt; Relations worsened between William and James thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 180–183&lt;/ref&gt; In November, James's second wife, [[Mary of Modena]], was announced to be pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 189&lt;/ref&gt; That month, to gain the favour of English Protestants, William wrote an [[open letter]] to the English people in which he disapproved of James's pro-Roman Catholic policy of religious toleration. Seeing him as a friend, and often having maintained secret contacts with him for years, many English politicians began to urge an armed invasion of England.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasion of England===
[[File:The Arrival of William III.jpg|alt=sepia-toned allegorical engraving representing William III's arrival at Tor Bay|thumb|''The Arrival of William III'' by [[James Thornhill|Sir James Thornhill]]. William landed in England on 5 November ([[Guy Fawkes night|Guy Fawkes]] day), a day already special in the Protestant calendar.]]

William at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688, as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy, and thus unable to mount an attack while William's troops would be occupied in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Troost, 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Claydon | first = Tony|origyear= September 2004|edition=online|date=May 2008|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29450|title=William III and II (1650–1702) |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 August 2008}} (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the English people would not react well to a foreign invader, he demanded in a letter to Rear-Admiral [[Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington|Arthur Herbert]] that the most eminent English Protestants first invite him to invade.&lt;ref name= troost191&gt;Troost, 191&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Mary of Modena, after a string of miscarriages, gave birth to a son, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], who displaced William's Protestant wife to become first in the line of succession and raised the prospect of an ongoing Catholic monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 191; van der Kiste, 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Public anger also increased because of the trial of [[seven bishops]] who had publicly opposed James's [[Declaration of Indulgence]] granting religious liberty to his subjects, a policy which appeared to threaten the establishment of the Anglican Church.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

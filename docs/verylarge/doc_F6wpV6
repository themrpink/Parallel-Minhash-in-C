A {{nihongo|'''ninja'''|{{linktext|忍者}}||{{IPA-ja|ɲiꜜɲdʑa}}}} or {{nihongo|'''''shinobi'''''|{{linktext|忍び}}||{{IPA-ja|ɕinobi|}}}} was a [[covert agent]] or [[mercenary]] in [[feudal Japan]]. The functions of a ninja included [[espionage]], [[Military deception|deception]], and surprise attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kawakami 21-22&quot;&gt;Kawakami, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Their covert methods of waging [[irregular warfare]] were deemed dishonorable and beneath the honor of the [[samurai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 5 6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though ''shinobi'' proper, as specially trained spies and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the [[Sengoku period]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Turnbull|title=Ninja Ad 1460-1650|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MnrpQRV-7wC&amp;pg=PA5|access-date=1 October 2011|date=19 February 2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-525-9|page=5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506013909/http://books.google.com/books?id=3MnrpQRV-7wC&amp;pg=PA5|archive-date=6 May 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowdy 2006 50&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowdy|2006|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frederic|2002|p=715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the unrest of the Sengoku period, mercenaries and spies for hire became active in [[Iga Province]] and the adjacent area around the village of [[Kōka, Shiga|Kōga]], and it is from these areas that much of the knowledge regarding the ninja is drawn. Following the unification of Japan under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in the 17th century, the ninja faded into obscurity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2001 355&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|2001|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ''shinobi'' manuals, often based on [[China|Chinese]] military [[philosophy]], were written in the 17th and 18th centuries, most notably the ''[[Bansenshukai]]'' (1676).&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2001 358&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|2001|p=358}}; based on different readings, ''Ninpiden'' is also known as ''Shinobi Hiden'', and ''Bansenshukai'' can also be ''Mansenshukai''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868), ''shinobi'' had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in Japan. Ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore, where they were associated with legendary abilities such as [[invisibility]], walking on water and control over natural [[Classical element#Japanese elements|elements]]. As a consequence, their [[Ninja in popular culture|perception in popular culture]] is based more on such legends and folklore than on the covert actors of the Sengoku period.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ninja-kanji.svg|thumb|left|The word &quot;ninja&quot; in [[kanji]] script]]

''Ninja'' is the ''[[on'yomi]]'' ([[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Early Middle Chinese–influenced]]) reading of the two [[kanji]] &quot;忍者&quot;. In the native ''[[kun'yomi]]'' reading, it is pronounced ''shinobi'', a shortened form of the transcription ''shinobi-no-mono'' (忍の者).&lt;ref name=&quot;Origin of word Ninja&quot;&gt;[http://pakninjas.com/is-it-ninja-or-shinobi-no-mono/ Origin of word Ninja] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502042122/http://pakninjas.com/is-it-ninja-or-shinobi-no-mono/ |date=2011-05-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''shinobi'' appears in the written record as far back as the late 8th century in poems in the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;takagi&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Takagi|Gomi|Ōno|1962|p=191}}; the full poem is &quot;''Yorozu yo ni / Kokoro ha tokete / Waga seko ga / Tsumishi te mitsutsu / Shinobi kanetsumo''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;satake&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Satake|Yasumada|Kudō|Ōtani|2003|p=108}}; the ''[[Man'yōgana]]'' used for &quot;''shinobi''{{-&quot;}} is 志乃備, its meaning and characters are unrelated to the later mercenary ''shinobi''.&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying connotation of ''shinobi'' ([[:wikt:忍|忍]]) means &quot;to steal away; to hide&quot; and—by extension—&quot;to forbear&quot;, hence its association with stealth and invisibility. ''Mono'' ([[:wikt:者|者]]) means &quot;a person&quot;.

Historically, the word ''ninja'' was not in common use, and a variety of regional [[colloquialism]]s evolved to describe what would later be dubbed ninja. Along with ''shinobi'', some examples include ''monomi'' (&quot;one who sees&quot;), ''nokizaru'' (&quot;[[Japanese macaque|macaque]] on the roof&quot;), ''rappa'' (&quot;ruffian&quot;), ''kusa'' (&quot;grass&quot;) and ''Iga-mono'' (&quot;one from Iga&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2001 355&quot; /&gt; In historical documents, ''shinobi'' is almost always used.

''[[Kunoichi]]'' (くノ一）is, originally, an [[argot]] which means &quot;woman&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=忍者の誕生|last=吉丸雄哉（associate professor of [[Mie University]])|date=April 2017|publisher=勉誠出版|isbn=978-4-585-22151-7|editor-last=吉丸雄哉、山田雄司　編|chapter=くのいちとは何か}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p168}} it supposedly comes from the characters くノ一 (pronounced ''ku'', ''no'' and ''ichi''), which make up the three strokes that form the [[kanji]] for &quot;woman&quot; (女).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|p168}} In fictions written in the modern era ''kunoichi'' means &quot;female ninja&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|p167}}

In the [[Western world|West]], the word ''ninja'' became more prevalent than ''shinobi'' in the post–[[World War II]] culture, possibly because it was more comfortable for Western speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[English language|English]], the plural of ''ninja'' can be either unchanged as ''ninja'', reflecting the Japanese language's lack of [[grammatical number]], or the regular English plural ''ninjas''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd ed.; ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'', 4th ed.; Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Ninja-and-Prince-Genji-Ukiyoe-Utagawa-Kunisada.png|thumb|Prince [[Hikaru Genji]] and a ninja. Woodblock print on paper. [[Kunisada]], 1853.]]

Despite many popular folktales, historical accounts of the ninja are scarce. Historian [[Stephen Turnbull (historian)|Stephen Turnbull]] asserts that the ninja were mostly recruited from the lower class, and therefore little literary interest was taken in them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social origin of the ninja is seen as the reason they agree to operate in secret, trading their service for money without honor and glory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mercenaries: A Guide to Private Armies and Private Military Companies|last=Axelrod|first=Alan|publisher=CQ Press|year=2015|isbn=9781483364674|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scarcity of historical accounts is also demonstrated in war epics such as ''[[The Tale of Hōgen]]'' ''(Hōgen Monogatari)'' and ''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'' ''(Heike Monogatari)'', which focus mainly on the aristocratic samurai, whose deeds were apparently more appealing to the audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 6&quot; /&gt;

Historian Kiyoshi Watatani states that the ninja were trained to be particularly secretive about their actions and existence:

{{quote|So-called ''[[ninjutsu]]'' techniques, in short are the skills of ''shinobi-no-jutsu'' and ''shinobijutsu'', which have the aims of ensuring that one's opponent does not know of one's existence, and for which there was special training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2007 144&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2007|p=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Predecessors ===
[[File:Yamato Takeru at 16-crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Yamato Takeru dressed as a maidservant, preparing to kill the Kumaso leaders. Woodblock print on paper. [[Tsukioka Yoshitoshi|Yoshitoshi]], 1886.]]

The title ''ninja'' has sometimes been attributed retrospectively to the semi-legendary 4th-century prince [[Yamato Takeru]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterhouse 1996 34&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waterhouse|1996|pp=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Kojiki]]'', the young Yamato Takeru disguised himself as a charming maiden and assassinated two chiefs of the [[Kumaso]] people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chamberlain 2005 249-253&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2005|pp=249–253}}; Volume 2, section 80&lt;/ref&gt; However, these records take place at a very early stage of Japanese history, and they are unlikely to be connected to the ''shinobi'' of later accounts. The first recorded use of espionage was under the employment of [[Prince Shōtoku]] in the 6th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratti 1991 325&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|p=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such tactics were considered unsavory even in early times, when, according to the 10th-century ''Shōmonki'', the boy spy [[Koharumaru]] was killed for spying against the insurgent [[Taira no Masakado]].&lt;ref name=&quot;friday 2007 58 60&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Friday|2007|pp=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the 14th-century war chronicle ''[[Taiheiki]]'' contained many references to ''shinobi''&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterhouse 1996 34&quot; /&gt; and credited the destruction of a castle by fire to an unnamed but &quot;highly skilled ''shinobi''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early history ===
It was not until the 15th century that spies were specially trained for their purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 5&quot; /&gt; It was around this time that the word ''shinobi'' appeared to define and clearly identify ninja as a secretive group of agents. Evidence for this can be seen in historical documents, which began to refer to stealthy soldiers as ''shinobi'' during the [[Sengoku period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later manuals regarding espionage are often grounded in Chinese [[military strategy]], quoting works such as ''[[The Art of War]]'' by [[Sun Tzu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ratti 1991 324&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

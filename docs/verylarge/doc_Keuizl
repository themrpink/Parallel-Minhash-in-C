===Great Lakes===
A family of freshwater fjords are the embayments of the North American Great Lakes.  Baie Fine is located on the northwestern coast of [[Georgian Bay]] of [[Lake Huron]] in [[Ontario]], and [[Huron Bay]] is located on the southern shore of [[Lake Superior]] in [[Michigan]].  {{clear left}}

The principal mountainous regions where fjords have formed are in the higher [[middle latitudes]] and the high latitudes reaching to 80°N (Svalbard, Greenland), where, during the glacial period, many valley glaciers descended to the then-lower sea level. The fjords develop best in mountain ranges against which the prevailing [[westerlies|westerly]] marine winds are [[Orographic lift|orographically lifted]] over the mountainous regions, resulting in abundant snowfall to feed the glaciers. Hence coasts having the most pronounced fjords include the west coast of Norway, the west coast of North America from [[Puget Sound]] to Alaska, the southwest coast of New Zealand, and the west and to south-western coasts of [[South America]], chiefly in [[Chile]].

[[File:Crawfish.jpg|thumb|Mexican style Crayfish]]
'''Crayfish''' are freshwater [[crustacean]]s resembling small [[lobster]]s (to which they are related). In some parts of the United States, they are also known as '''crawfish''', '''craydids''', '''crawdaddies''', '''crawdads''', '''freshwater lobsters''', '''mountain lobsters''', '''mudbugs''', or '''yabbies'''. Taxonomically, they are members of the [[Superfamily (zoology)|superfamilies]] Astacoidea and [[Parastacoidea]]. They breathe through feather-like [[gill]]s. Some species are found in brooks and streams, where  [[fresh water]] is running, while others thrive in [[swamp]]s, ditches, and [[paddy fields]]. Most crayfish cannot tolerate [[Water pollution|polluted water]], although some species, such as ''[[Procambarus clarkii]]'', are hardier. Crayfish feed on animals and plants, either living or [[decomposing]], and [[detritus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Christoph Needon |author2=Johannes Petermann |author3=Peter Scheffel |author4=Bernd Scheibe |title=Plants and Animals (Pflanzen und Tiere) |publisher=Urania Verlag |location=Leipzig |year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;crayfish&quot; is applied to saltwater species [[#Other animals|in some countries]].

==Terminology==
The name &quot;crayfish&quot; comes from the [[Old French language|Old French]] word ''{{lang|fro|escrevisse}}'' ([[French language|Modern French]] ''{{lang|fr|écrevisse}}'').&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;{{Cite OED|crayfish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|author-link=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=75|year=1855|issue=6|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been modified to &quot;crayfish&quot; by association with &quot;fish&quot; ([[folk etymology]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; The largely [[American English|American]] variant &quot;crawfish&quot; is similarly derived.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt;

Some kinds of crayfish are known locally as [[lobster]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C. W.

In the [[Eastern United States]], &quot;crayfish&quot; is more common in the north, while &quot;crawdad&quot; is heard more in central and southwestern regions, and &quot;crawfish&quot; farther south, although considerable overlaps exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Bert Vaux |author2=Scott A.

The study of crayfish is called astacology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://147.72.68.29/crayfish/IAA/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405165844/http://147.72.68.29/crayfish/IAA/ |archive-date=5 April 2005 |title=About the International Association of Astacology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
{{Main|Decapod anatomy}}
The body of a [[Decapoda|decapod]] [[crustacean]], such as a crab, lobster, or prawn (shrimp), is made up of twenty [[body segment]]s grouped into two main body parts, the [[cephalothorax]] and the [[abdomen]]. Each segment may possess one pair of [[appendage]]s, although in various groups, these may be reduced or missing. On average, crayfish grow to {{convert|17.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length. Walking legs have a small claw at the end.

Three families of crayfish are described, two in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and one in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The Southern Hemisphere ([[Gondwana]]-distributed) family [[Parastacidae]], with 14 extant genera and two extinct genera, live(d) in [[South America]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Australasia]]. They are distinguished by the absence of the first pair of [[pleopod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Horton H. Hobbs Jr. |s2cid= 86685246 |author-link= Horton H. Hobbs Jr.  |year=1974 |title=Synopsis of the families and genera of crayfishes (Crustacea: Decapoda) |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology |volume=164 |issue=164 |pages=1–32 |doi=10.5479/si.00810282.164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the other two families, the three genera of the [[Astacidae]] live in western [[Eurasia]] and western [[North America]], while the 15 genera of the family [[Cambaridae]] live in eastern [[Asia]] and eastern [[North America]].

===North America===
The greatest diversity of crayfish species is found in southeastern North America, with over 330 species in nine genera, all in the family Cambaridae. A further genus of astacid crayfish is found in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the headwaters of some rivers east of the [[Continental Divide]]. Many crayfish are also found in lowland areas where the water is abundant in [[calcium]], and oxygen rises from underground springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steve Pollock |title=Eyewitness Ecology |location=[[New York City|New York]], [[United States]] |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7894-5581-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/eyewitness00stev }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Louisiana designated the crayfish, or crawfish as they are commonly called, as its official state crustacean.&lt;ref name=Profile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanprofile.com/articles/the-crawfish-louisianas-state-crustacean/|title=The Crawfish – Louisiana's State Crustacean|publisher=American Profile|date=11 August 2002|access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisiana produces 100&amp;nbsp;million pounds of crawfish per year with the [[Procambarus clarkii|red swamp]] and [[Procambarus zonangulus|white river crawfish]] being the main species harvested.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/louisiana/state-fish-aquatic-life-state-food-agriculture-symbol/crawfish|title=Crawfish Louisiana State Crustacean|work=State of Louisiana-Department of Administration|access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawfish are a part of [[Cajun]] culture dating back hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=VOA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/crawfish-deeply-rooted-in-louisiana-culture/3292538.html|title=Crawfish Deeply Rooted in Louisiana Culture |publisher=Voice of America|date=19 April 2016|access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of cottage industries have developed as a result of commercialized crawfish iconology.

===Australia===
[[Australia]] has over 100 species in a dozen [[genus|genera]]. It is home to the world's three largest freshwater crayfish:
*the [[Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish]] ''Astacopsis gouldi'', which can achieve a mass over {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and is found in rivers of northern [[Tasmania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/lobster.html |title=Tasmanian Giant Freshwater Lobster (''Astacopsis gouldi'') |publisher=[[Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts]] |date=9 February 2007 |access-date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the [[Murray crayfish]] ''Euastacus armatus'', which can reach {{convert|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, although  reports of animals up to {{convert|3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} have been made. It is found in much of the southern [[Murray-Darling basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Murray crayfish – Euastacus armatus as a Vulnerable Species | publisher= NSW Department of Primary Industries |author= Fisheries Scientific Committee | date=2013 | url=https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/545688/FFRS-89_Gilligan-et-al-2007.pdf |access-date=11 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the [[marron]] from [[Western Australia]] (now believed to be two species, ''[[Cherax tenuimanus]]'' and ''[[Cherax|C. cainii]]'') which may reach {{convert|2.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}}

Many of the better-known Australian crayfish are of the genus ''Cherax'', and include the [[common yabby]] (''C. destructor''), western yabby (''C. preissii''), and [[red-claw crayfish]] (''C. quadricarinatus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://aquanic.org/publicat/usda_rac/efs/srac/244fs.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050513095955/http://aquanic.org/publicat/usda_rac/efs/srac/244fs.pdf |archive-date=13 May 2005 |year=1997 |journal=SRAC Publication |issue=244 |title=Australian Red Claw Crayfish |author1=Michael P. Masser |author2=David B. Rouse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marron species ''C. tenuimanus'' is [[critically endangered]], while other large Australasian crayfish are threatened or endangered.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], two species of ''[[Paranephrops]]'' are endemic, and are known by the [[Māori language|Māori]] name ''{{lang|mi|kōura}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niwa.co.nz/our-science/freshwater/tools/kaitiaki_tools/species/koura |title=Kōura |publisher=[[NIWA]] |access-date=18 September 2012|date=2009-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other animals===
In Australia, New Zealand, and [[South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/explore/articles/lobsters-rock-lobsters-and-crayfish|title=Lobsters, rock lobsters and crayfish|publisher=Western Australian Museum|access-date=30 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;crayfish&quot; or &quot;cray&quot; generally refers to a saltwater [[spiny lobster]], of the genus ''[[Jasus]]'' that is indigenous to much of southern [[Oceania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/156854065X00613 |title=Let's call the spiny lobster &quot;spiny lobster&quot; |author=Harold W.

==Threats to crayfish==
Crayfish are susceptible to infections such as [[crayfish plague]] and to environmental stressors including acidification. In Europe, they are particularly threatened by crayfish plague, which is caused by the North American [[water mold]] ''Aphanomyces astaci.'' This water mold was transmitted to Europe when North American species of crayfish were introduced there.&lt;ref name=&quot;lee-james&quot;/&gt; Species of the genus ''[[Astacus]]'' are particularly susceptible to infection, allowing the plague-coevolved [[signal crayfish]] (native to western North America) to invade parts of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nonindigenous Aquatic Species - Pacifastacus leniusculus|url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=200|access-date=July 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acid rain]] can cause problems for crayfish across the world. In whole-ecosystem experiments simulating acid rain at the [[Experimental Lakes Area]] in [[Ontario|Ontario, Canada]], crayfish populations crashed – probably because their [[Exoskeleton|exoskeletons]] are weaker in [[Freshwater acidification|acidified]] environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2018-05-16|title=A Canadian Scientist Explains How Acid Rain is Still Making its Mark|url=https://www.iisd.org/ela/blog/research-highlights/acid-rain-totally-last-century-right-not-exactly-canadian-scientist-explains-acid-rain-still-making-mark/|access-date=2020-07-06|website=IISD Experimental Lakes Area}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
{{main|Crayfish as food}}

Crayfish are eaten worldwide. Like other edible crustaceans, only a small portion of the body of a crayfish is eaten. In most prepared dishes, such as soups, [[Bisque (food)|bisques]] and [[étouffée]]s, only the tail portion is served. At [[seafood boil|crawfish boils]] or other meals where the entire body of the crayfish is presented, other portions, such as the claw meat, may be eaten. Like all crustaceans, crayfish are not [[kosher]] because they are aquatic animals that do not have both [[fin]]s and [[scale (zoology)|scales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trianglek.org/kosherdefined.html |title=Kosher defined |access-date=1 December 2010 |publisher=[[Triangle K]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are therefore not eaten by observant [[Jew]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer-Rochow 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer-Rochow| first= Victor Benno | title= Food taboos: their origins and purposes|journal= Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine | date=2009| volume=5–18|

Greg Lutz, Crawfish Aquaculture — Marketing (SRAC Publication No. 2402). October 2005.

When using live crayfish as bait, anglers prefer to hook them between the eyes, piercing through their hard, pointed beak which causes them no harm; therefore, they remain more active.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Bean | first=Richard Alden | title=Crayfish: What Better Spring Bait For Bass? | website=Game &amp; Fish | date=2011-04-06 | url=http://www.gameandfishmag.com/fishing/fishing_bass-fishing_crayfish_what_better_spring_bait0411/ | access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When using crayfish as bait, it is important to fish in the same environment where they were caught. An [[Illinois State University]] report that focused on studies conducted on the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]] and [[Des Plaines River]] watershed stated that [[rusty crayfish]], initially caught as bait in a different environment, were dumped into the water and &quot;outcompeted the native clearwater crayfish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://dnr.state.il.us/orep/ctap2/Chp%205.pdf |chapter=Fox and Des Plaines Rivers Watershed |title=Critical Trends in Illinois Ecosystems |publisher=[[Illinois Department of Natural Resources]] |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies confirmed that transporting crayfish to different environments have led to various ecological problems, including the elimination of native species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.state.tn.us/twra/pdfs/aquaticplan.pdf |title=Tennessee Aquatic Nuisance Species Management Plan |author=Tennessee Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force |year=2007 |publisher=[[Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transporting crayfishes as live bait has also contributed to the spread of [[zebra mussels]] in various waterways throughout Europe and North America, as they are known to attach themselves to exoskeleton of crayfishes.&lt;ref name=HaGov&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawaii Risk Analyses and Management for Dreissenid Mussels|url=https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/ais/files/2014/02/Hawaii-Dreissena-Mussel-Assessment-2012.pdf |page=3|publisher=US Fish &amp; Wildlife|date=2012|access-date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonindigenous Aquatic Species 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) – Species Profile | website=Nonindigenous Aquatic Species | date=2005-11-16 | url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=5 | access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sfbay.wr.usgs.gov/benthic_eco/exotic_species/next.html |title=The History and Effects of Exotic Species in San Francisco Bay |author1=J.

===Pets===
Crayfish are kept as pets in freshwater aquariums. They prefer foods like shrimp pellets or various vegetables, but will also eat tropical fish food, regular fish food, algae wafers, and small fish that can be captured with their claws. A report by the [[National Park Service]]&lt;ref name=&quot; abebault&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= abebault | website=Google | url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Zz9KmRUNyHIJ:https://www.nps.gov/laro/learn/education/upload/Crayfish-facts.docx+&amp;cd=18&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari | title=Crayfish Facts | date=May 2013|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as video and anecdotal reports by aquarium owners&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=YouTube | website=YouTube | date=2018-04-12 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliDZyD5KnU | access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that crayfish will eat their molted exoskeleton &quot;to recover the calcium and phosphates contained in it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot; abebault&quot;/&gt;  As omnivores, crayfish will eat almost anything; therefore, they may explore the edibility of aquarium plants in a fish tank. However, most species of dwarf crayfish, such as ''[[Cambarellus patzcuarensis]]'', will not destructively dig or eat live aquarium plants.&lt;ref name = petshrimp&gt;{{cite web |author=Gerald Pottern |title=Mexican dwarf orange crayfish, ''Cambarellus patzcuarensis'' |url=http://www.petshrimp.com/articles/cpatzcuarensis.php |access-date=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some nations, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], imported alien crayfish are a danger to local rivers. The three species commonly imported to Europe from the Americas are ''[[Orconectes limosus]]'', ''[[Pacifastacus leniusculus]]'' and ''[[Procambarus clarkii]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;lee-james&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=James R.

There is a potential for ecological damage when crayfish are introduced into non-native bodies of water: e.g., [[crayfish plague]] in Europe, or the introduction of the common yabby (''Cherax destructor'') into drainages east of the Great Dividing Range in Australia.&lt;ref name=auzoo&gt;{{cite journal | author=Coughran, J, Mccormack, R, Daly, G | title=Translocation of the Yabby Cherax destructor into eastern drainages of New South Wales, Australia | journal=Australian Zoologist | volume=35 | year=2009 | pages=100–103 | doi=10.7882/AZ.2009.009 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271520252 | access-date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentinel species===
The Protivin brewery in the [[Czech Republic]] uses crayfish outfitted with sensors to detect any changes in their bodies or pulse activity in order to monitor the purity of the water used in their product. The creatures are kept in a fish tank that is fed with the same local natural source water used in their brewing. If three or more of the crayfish have changes to their pulses, employees know there is a change in the water and examine the parameters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brewery&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-czech-crayfish-water-purity/crayfish-staff-help-czech-brewery-keep-its-water-as-pure-as-can-be-idUSKCN1C22GP|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025221438/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-czech-crayfish-water-purity/crayfish-staff-help-czech-brewery-keep-its-water-as-pure-as-can-be-idUSKCN1C22GP|title=Crayfish staff help Czech brewery keep its water as pure as can be|work=[[Reuters TV]]|last=Hanrahan|first=Mark|date=27 September 2017|archive-date=25 October 2019|access-date=25 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''gnuplot''' is a [[command-line]] program that can generate two- and three-dimensional [[Plot (graphics)|plots]] of [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[data]], and [[Curve fitting|data fits]]. The program runs on all major [[computer]]s and [[operating system]]s ([[Linux]], [[Unix]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], and others).
It is a program with a fairly long history, dating back to 1986. Despite its name, this software is not part of the [[GNU Project]].

== Features ==
gnuplot can produce output directly on screen, or in many formats of graphics files, including [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG), [[Encapsulated PostScript]] (EPS), [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG), [[JPEG]] and many others. It is also capable of producing [[LaTeX]] code that can be included directly in LaTeX documents, making use of LaTeX's fonts and powerful formula notation abilities. The program can be used both interactively and in batch mode using scripts.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|title=How to generate graphs with gnuplot|url=http://blogs.oucs.ox.ac.uk/networks/2011/09/02/how-to-generate-graphs-with-gnuplot/|accessdate=2012-07-19}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

gnuplot can read data in multiple formats, including ability to read data on the fly generated by other programs ([[Pipe (Unix)|piping]]), create multiple plots on one image, do 2D, 3D, contour plots, parametric equations, supports various linear and non-linear coordinate systems, projections, geographic and time data reading and presentation, box plots of various forms, histograms, labels, and other custom elements on the plot, including shapes, text and images, that can be set manually, computed by script or automatically from input data.

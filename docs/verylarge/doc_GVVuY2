=== Weathering ===
{{Main|Weathering}}

Compared to other rocks found on Earth's surface, exposed surfaces of basalt [[outcrop]]s weather relatively rapidly in water and air due to oxidation of iron-rich minerals into [[hematite]] or other iron oxides and hydroxides, staining the rock a brown to rust-red colour.&lt;ref name=&quot;mackin-1961&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mackin |first1=J.H. |year=1961 |title=A stratigraphic section in the Yakima Basalt and the Ellensburg Formation in south-central Washington |journal=Washington Division of Mines and Geology Report of Investigations |volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs-holyoke&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Holyoke Basalt |url=https://mrdata.usgs.gov/geology/state/sgmc-unit.php?unit=CTJho%3B0 |website=USGS Mineral Resources Program |publisher=United States Geological Survey |access-date=13 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anderson-1987&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=J.L. |title=Geologic map of the Goldendale 15' quadrangle, Washington |journal=Washington Division of Geology and Earth Resources Open File Report |date=1987 |volume=87-15 |url=https://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/ger_ofr87-15_goldendale_39k.pdf |access-date=13 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blatt-etal-1980&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blatt |first1=Harvey |last2=Middletone |first2=Gerard |last3=Murray |first3=Raymond |title=Origin of sedimentary rocks |date=1980 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. |isbn=0136427103 |edition=2d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical weathering also releases readily water-soluble cations such as [[calcium]], [[sodium]] and [[magnesium]], which give basaltic areas a strong [[buffer capacity]] against [[Soil acidification|acidification]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gillman-etal-2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gillman |first1=G.P |last2=Burkett |first2=D.C |last3=Coventry |first3=R.J |title=Amending highly weathered soils with finely ground basalt rock |journal=Applied Geochemistry |date=August 2002 |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=987–1001 |doi=10.1016/S0883-2927(02)00078-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium released by basalts binds [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] from the atmosphere forming [[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] acting thus as a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; trap.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcgrail-etal-2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McGrail |first1=B.

=== Metamorphism ===
[[File:Archean Greenstone Pillow Lava in Michigan USA 3.jpg|thumb|Metamorphosed basalt from an [[Archean]] [[greenstone belt]] in Michigan, US. The minerals that gave the original basalt its black colour have been metamorphosed into green minerals.]]

Intense heat or great pressure transforms basalt into its [[metamorphic rock]] equivalents. Basalts are important rocks within metamorphic regions because they can provide vital information on the conditions of [[metamorphism]] that have affected the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;blatt-tracy-1996&quot; /&gt;

Metamorphosed basalts are important hosts for a variety of [[hydrothermal]] [[ore]]s, including deposits of gold, copper and [[volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit|volcanogenic massive sulfide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Yardley|first1=Bruce W.

== Life on basaltic rocks ==
The common corrosion features of underwater volcanic basalt suggest that microbial activity may play a significant role in the chemical exchange between basaltic rocks and seawater. The significant amounts of reduced iron, Fe(II), and manganese, Mn(II), present in basaltic rocks provide potential energy sources for [[bacteria]]. Some Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria cultured from iron-sulfide surfaces are also able to grow with basaltic rock as a source of Fe(II).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Katrina J. |last1=Edwards |first2=Wolfgang |last2=Bach |first3=Daniel R. |last3=Rogers |title=Geomicrobiology of the Ocean Crust: A Role for Chemoautotrophic Fe-Bacteria |journal=Biological Bulletin |volume=204 |issue=2 |pages=180–185 |date=April 2003 |url=http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/content/full/204/2/180 |access-date=4 November 2015 |doi=10.2307/1543555|pmid=12700150 |jstor=1543555 |s2cid=1717188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fe- and Mn- oxidizing bacteria have been cultured from weathered submarine basalts of [[Loihi Seamount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Templeton|first1=Alexis S.|last2=Staudigel|first2=Hubert|last3=Tebo|first3=Bradley M.|title=Diverse Mn(II)-Oxidizing Bacteria Isolated from Submarine Basalts at Loihi Seamount|journal=Geomicrobiology Journal|date=April 2005|volume=22|issue=3–4|pages=127–139|doi=10.1080/01490450590945951|s2cid=17410610}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of bacteria on altering the chemical composition of basaltic glass (and thus, the [[oceanic crust]]) and seawater suggest that these interactions may lead to an application of [[hydrothermal vents]] to the [[origin of life]].&lt;ref name=&quot;martin-etal-2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=William |last2=Baross |first2=John |last3=Kelley |first3=Deborah |last4=Russell |first4=Michael J. |title=Hydrothermal vents and the origin of life |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |date=November 2008 |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=805–814 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1991|pmid=18820700 |s2cid=1709272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon sequestration]] in basalt has been studied as a means of removing carbon dioxide, produced by human industrialization, from the atmosphere.

[[Image:Bienenvolk-Gemuell.jpg|thumb|220px|Fresh wax scales (in the middle of the lower row)]]
'''Beeswax''' ('''''cera alba''''') is a natural [[wax]] produced by [[honey bee]]s of the genus ''Apis''.  The wax is formed into scales by eight wax-producing glands in the abdominal segments of [[worker bee]]s, which discard it in or at the hive.  The hive workers collect and use it to form cells for honey storage and larval and pupal protection within the [[beehive]].  Chemically, beeswax consists mainly of [[ester]]s of [[fatty acids]] and various [[fatty alcohol|long-chain alcohols]].

Beeswax has been used since prehistory as the first plastic, as a lubricant and waterproofing agent, in [[lost wax casting]] of metals and glass, as a [[wood finishing|polish]] for wood and leather, for making [[candles]], as an ingredient in cosmetics and as an artistic medium in [[encaustic painting]]. 

Beeswax is edible, having similar negligible [[toxicity]] to plant waxes, and is approved for food use in most countries and in the [[European Union]] under the [[E number]] E901.

==Production==
The wax is formed by [[worker bee]]s, which secrete it from eight wax-producing mirror glands on the inner sides of the [[Sternum (arthropod anatomy)|sternites]] (the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] shield or plate of each segment of the body) on abdominal segments 4 to 7.&lt;ref name=Sanford&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanford|first1=M.T.|last2=Dietz|first2=A.|year=1976|title=The fine structure of the wax gland of the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.).|journal=Apidologie|volume=7|issue=3|pages=197–207|doi=10.1051/apido:19760301|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00890403/file/hal-00890403.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sizes of these wax glands depend on the age of the worker, and after many daily flights, these glands gradually begin to [[atrophy]].

The new wax is initially glass-clear and colorless, becoming [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] after [[chewing]] and being contaminated with pollen by the hive worker bees, becoming progressively yellower or browner by incorporation of [[pollen]] oils and [[propolis]].  The wax scales are about {{convert|3|mm|in|spell=in}} across and {{convert|0.1|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and about 1100 are needed to make a gram of wax.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R, H. (1981) ''Beeswax'' (2nd edition) Bee Books New and Old, Burrowbridge, Somerset UK. {{ISBN|0-905652-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worker bees use the beeswax to build [[honeycomb]] cells. For the wax-making bees to secrete wax, the ambient temperature in the hive must be {{convert|33|to|36|C|}}.

Honey in fat cells associated with wax glands are metabolized by bees into beeswax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Collision | first = Clarence | title = A CLOSER LOOK: BEESWAX, WAX GLANDS | pages = 12–27  | newspaper = Bee Culture | publisher = beeculture.com | date = 31 March 2015  | url = https://www.beeculture.com/a-closer-look-beeswax-wax-glands/ | accessdate = 2020-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of [[honey]] used by bees to produce wax has not been accurately determined.

==Processing==
When beekeepers extract the honey, they cut off the wax caps from each honeycomb cell with an uncapping knife or machine.

Beeswax may arise from such cappings, or from old comb that is scrapped, or from the beekeeper removing unwanted [[burr comb]] and [[brace comb]] and suchlike. Its color varies from nearly white to brownish, but most often is a shade of yellow, depending on purity, the region, and the type of flowers gathered by the bees. Wax from the [[brood comb]] of the honey bee hive tends to be darker than wax from the honeycomb, because impurities accumulate more quickly in the brood comb. Due to the impurities, the wax must be rendered before further use. The leftovers are called [[slumgum]], and is derived from old breeding rubbish (pupa casings, cocoons, shed larva skíns, etc), bee droppings, propolis, and general rubbish.

The wax may be clarified further by heating in water. As with petroleum waxes, it may be softened by dilution with mineral oil or vegetable oil to make it more workable at room temperature.

==Bees reworking old wax==
When bees, needing food, uncap honey, they drop the removed cappings and let them fall to the bottom of the hive. It is known for bees to rework such an accumulation of fallen old cappings into strange formations.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Beeswax is a tough [[wax]] formed from a mixture of several [[chemical compound]]s.
An approximate [[structural formula|chemical formula]] for beeswax is C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;COOC&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Umney |first=Nick |author2=Shayne Rivers |title=Conservation of Furniture |year=2003 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main constituents are [[palmitate]], [[Palmitoleic acid|palmitoleate]], and [[oleic acid|oleate]] [[ester]]s of long-chain (30–32 carbons) [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] [[alcohol]]s, with the ratio of [[palmitate|triacontanyl palmitate]] CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;29&lt;/sub&gt;O-CO-(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to [[cerotic acid]] CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;COOH, the two principal constituents, being 6:1{{citation needed|reason=need reference for main components and ratio|date=April 2020}}. Beeswax can be classified generally into European and Oriental types. The [[saponification value]] is lower (3–5) for European beeswax, and higher (8–9) for Oriental types{{citation needed|reason=where are these numbers from?|date=April 2020}}.The analytical characterization can be done by high-temperature [[Gas Chromatography]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Limsathayourat, H.-U. Melchert: ''High-temperature capillary GLC of hydrocarbons, fatty-acid derivatives, cholesterol esters, wax esters and triglycerides in beeswax analysis.'' In: ''Fresenius’ Journal of Analytical Chemistry.'' 318, Nr.&amp;nbsp;6, 1984, S.&amp;nbsp;410–413, {{DOI|10.1007/BF00533223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beeswax has a relatively low [[melting point]] range of 62 to 64&amp;nbsp;°C (144 to 147&amp;nbsp;°F). If beeswax is heated above 85&amp;nbsp;°C (185&amp;nbsp;°F) discoloration occurs. The flash point of beeswax is 204.4&amp;nbsp;°C (400&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/02556.htm|title=MSDS for beeswax}}. No reported [[autoignition temperature]] has been reported&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Triacontanyl palmitate.png|thumb|right|440px|Triacontanyl palmitate, a [[wax ester]], is a major component of beeswax.]]

When natural beeswax is cold,{{clarification needed|reason=how cold is cold?|date=January 2019}} it is brittle, and its fracture is dry and granular. At [[room temperature]] (conventionally taken as about 20 °C (68 °F)), it is tenacious and it softens further at human [[body temperature]] (37 °C (99 °F)). The [[specific gravity]] of beeswax at {{convert|15|C|F}} is from 0.958 to 0.975; that of melted beeswax at {{convert|98|to|99|C|F|1}} (compared with water at {{convert|15.5|C|F|1}}) is 0.9822.&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Applied Chemistry, Vol. 5.

Candle-making has long involved the use of beeswax, which burns readily and cleanly, and this material was traditionally prescribed for the making of the [[Paschal candle]] or &quot;Easter candle&quot;. Beeswax candles are purported to be superior to other wax candles, because they burn brighter and longer, do not bend, and burn &quot;cleaner&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Honey Bee Hobbyist: The Care and Keeping of Bees|last=Norman|first=Gary|publisher=BowTie Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-933958-94-1|location=California, USA|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further recommended for the making of other candles used in the [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01347a.htm 'Altar Candles&quot;], 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;  Beeswax is also the candle constituent of choice in the [[Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2010/02/use-of-candles-in-orthodox-church.html], Use of Candles in the Orthodox Church&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Uwe Wolfmeier, Hans Schmidt, Franz-Leo Heinrichs, Georg Michalczyk, Wolfgang Payer, Wolfram Dietsche, Klaus Boehlke, Gerd Hohner, Josef Wildgruber &quot;Waxes&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beeswax is an ingredient in surgical [[bone wax]], which is used during surgery to control bleeding from bone surfaces; [[shoe polish]] and [[furniture polish]] can both use beeswax as a component, dissolved in turpentine or sometimes blended with [[linseed oil]] or [[tung oil]]; modeling waxes can also use beeswax as a component; pure beeswax can also be used as an organic [[surfboard wax]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morenature.com/raw-beeswax-uses.html 'Raw Beeswax Uses&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106110135/http://www.morenature.com/raw-beeswax-uses.html |date=2013-11-06 }}, MoreNature&lt;/ref&gt; Beeswax blended with pine [[rosin]] is used for [[waxing]], and can serve as an adhesive to attach reed plates to the structure inside a [[squeezebox]]. It can also be used to make [[Cutler's resin]], an adhesive used to glue handles onto cutlery knives. It is used in Eastern Europe in egg decoration; it is used for writing, via [[resist dyeing]], on [[batik]] eggs (as in ''[[pysanka|pysanky]]'') and for making beaded eggs.
Beeswax is used by [[percussionist]]s to make a surface on [[tambourine]]s for thumb rolls. It can also be used as a metal injection moulding binder component along with other polymeric binder materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enggpedia.com/chemical-engineering-encyclopedia/dictionary/chemical-processes/1793-metal-injection-molding-process-mim 'Metal Injection Molding Process (MIM)&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510045029/http://enggpedia.com/chemical-engineering-encyclopedia/dictionary/chemical-processes/1793-metal-injection-molding-process-mim |date=2012-05-10 }}, 2012 EngPedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Beeswax was formerly used in the manufacture of phonograph cylinders. It may still be used to seal formal legal or [[royal decree]] and academic parchments such as placing an awarding stamp [[imprimatur]] of the university upon completion of postgraduate degrees.

Purified and bleached beeswax is used in the production of food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. The three main types of beeswax products are yellow, white, and beeswax absolute. Yellow beeswax is the crude product obtained from the honeycomb, white beeswax is bleached or filtered yellow beeswax, and beeswax [[Absolute (perfumery)|absolute]] is yellow beeswax treated with alcohol. In food preparation, it is used as a coating for cheese; by sealing out the air, protection is given against spoilage (mold growth). Beeswax may also be used as a food additive [[E number|E901]], in small quantities acting as a [[glazing agent]], which serves to prevent water loss, or used to provide surface protection for some fruits. Soft gelatin capsules and tablet coatings may also use E901. Beeswax is also a common ingredient of natural chewing gum. The wax monoesters in beeswax are poorly hydrolysed in the guts of humans and other [[mammals]], so they have insignificant nutritional value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/scientific_output/files/main_documents/615.pdf Beeswax absorption and toxicity]. Large amounts of such waxes in the diet pose theoretical toxicological problems for mammals.&lt;/ref&gt; Some birds, such as [[honeyguide]]s, can digest beeswax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Downs |first1=Colleen T |last2=van Dyk |first2=Robyn J |last3=Iji |first3=Paul |title=Wax digestion by the lesser honeyguide Indicator minor |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular &amp; Integrative Physiology |date=September 2002 |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=125–134 |doi=10.1016/s1095-6433(02)00130-7|pmid=12160878 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beeswax is the main diet of [[Lesser wax moth|wax moth]] larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dadd |first1=R.H. |title=Beeswax in the nutrition of the wax moth, Galleria mellonella (L.) |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |date=December 1966 |volume=12 |issue=12 |pages=1479–1492 |doi=10.1016/0022-1910(66)90038-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of beeswax in skin care and cosmetics has been increasing. A German study found beeswax to be superior to similar barrier creams (usually mineral oil-based creams such as [[petroleum jelly]]), when used according to its protocol.&lt;ref&gt;

Beeswax is used in [[lip balm]], [[lip gloss]], [[hand cream]]s, salves, and moisturizers; and in cosmetics such as [[eye shadow]], blush, and [[eye liner]]. Beeswax is also an important ingredient in [[moustache wax]] and [[hair pomade]]s, which make hair look sleek and shiny.

In oil spill control, beeswax is processed to create [[Petroleum Remediation Product]] (PRP). It is used to absorb oil or petroleum-based pollutants from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.spacefoundation.org/space_technology_hal/petroleum-remediation-product/ |title=Petroleum Remediation Product |website=spacefoundation.org |date=November 3, 2017 |accessdate=January 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beeswax was among the first plastics to be used, alongside other natural polymers such as [[gutta-percha]], [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]], [[Tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]], and [[shellac]]. For thousands of years, beeswax has had a wide variety of applications; it has been found in the tombs of Egypt, in wrecked Viking ships, and in Roman ruins. Beeswax never goes bad and can be heated and reused. Historically, it has been used:

* As candles - the oldest intact beeswax candles north of the Alps were found in the [[Alemanni|Alamannic]] graveyard of [[Seitingen-Oberflacht|Oberflacht, Germany]], dating to 6th/7th century AD
* In the manufacture of cosmetics
* As a modelling material in the [[lost-wax casting]] process, or ''cire perdue''&lt;ref name=Condon&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. O.

In some contexts, especially in [[photography]] and [[astronomy]], ''aperture'' refers to the ''diameter'' of the aperture stop rather than the physical stop or the opening itself. For example, in a [[telescope]], the aperture stop is typically the edges of the [[objective lens]] or mirror (or of the mount that holds it). One then speaks of a telescope as having, for example, a 100-centimeter ''aperture''. Note that the aperture stop is not necessarily the smallest stop in the system. Magnification and demagnification by lenses and other elements can cause a relatively large stop to be the aperture stop for the system. In [[astrophotography]], the aperture may be given as a linear measure (for example in inches or mm) or as the dimensionless ratio between that measure and the [[focal length]]. In other photography, it is usually given as a ratio.

Sometimes stops and diaphragms are called apertures, even when they are not the aperture stop of the system.

The word ''aperture'' is also used in other contexts to indicate a system which blocks off light outside a certain region. In astronomy, for example, a [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] aperture around a [[star]] usually corresponds to a circular window around the image of a star within which the light intensity is assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Eaton, Peter W. Draper &amp; Alasdair Allan, [http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/star/docs/sun45.htx/node36.html Techniques of aperture photometry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311210838/http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/star/docs/sun45.htx/node36.html |date=11 March 2007 }} in PHOTOM – A Photometry Package, 20 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

The aperture stop is an important element in most optical designs. Its most obvious feature is that it limits the amount of light that can reach the image/[[film plane]]. This can be either unavoidable, as in a telescope where one wants to collect as much light as possible; or deliberate, to prevent saturation of a detector or overexposure of film. In both cases, the size of the aperture stop is constrained by things other than the amount of light admitted; however:
*The size of the stop is one factor that affects [[depth of field]]. &lt;!-- There is some confusion here. So let's be clear: Long depth of field occurs when the lens opening, and thus the stop, is small. However, a small opening equals a large f-stop number. The size of the stop equates to the size of the opening of the lens. For example, the larger the size of the size of the stop, the less light will be let in through the lens because the opening will be smaller.  --&gt; Smaller stops (larger [[f number]]s) produce a longer [[depth of field]], allowing objects at a wide range of distances from the viewer to all be in focus at the same time.
*The stop limits the effect of optical [[Aberration in optical systems|aberrations]]. If the stop is too large, the image will be distorted. More sophisticated optical system designs can mitigate the effect of aberrations, allowing a larger stop and therefore greater light collecting ability.
*The stop determines whether the image will be [[vignetting|vignetted]]. Larger stops can cause the intensity reaching the film or detector to fall off toward the edges of the picture, especially when, for off-axis points, a different stop becomes the aperture stop by virtue of cutting off more light than did the stop that was the aperture stop on the optic axis.
*A larger aperture stop requires larger diameter optics, which are heavier and more expensive.

In addition to an aperture stop, a photographic lens may have one or more ''field stops'', which limit the system's [[Angle of view|field of view]].  When the field of view is limited by a field stop in the lens (rather than at the film or sensor) [[vignetting]] results; this is only a problem if the resulting field of view is less than was desired.

The [[pupil|biological pupil]] of the [[Human eye|eye]] is its aperture in optics nomenclature; the iris is the diaphragm that serves as the aperture stop. Refraction in the [[cornea]] causes the effective aperture (the [[entrance pupil]] in optics parlance) to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter. The entrance pupil is typically about 4&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, although it can range from 2&amp;nbsp;mm ({{f/|8.3|link=yes}}) in a brightly lit place to 8&amp;nbsp;mm ({{f/|2.1}}) in the dark.

In astronomy, the diameter of the aperture stop (called the ''aperture'') is a critical parameter in the design of a [[telescope]]. Generally, one would want the ''aperture'' to be as large as possible, to collect the maximum amount of light from the distant objects being imaged. The size of the aperture is limited, however, in practice by considerations of cost and weight, as well as prevention of aberrations (as mentioned above).

Apertures are also used in laser energy control, close aperture [[z-scan technique]], diffractions/patterns, and beam cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rashidian Vaziri|first1=M R|title=Role of the aperture in Z-scan experiments: A parametric study|journal=Chinese Physics B|volume=24|issue=11|pages=114206|doi=10.1088/1674-1056/24/11/114206|bibcode = 2015ChPhB..24k4206R |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laser applications include spatial filters, Q-switching, high intensity x-ray control.

In light microscopy, the word aperture may be used with reference to either the [[Condenser (microscope)|condenser]] (changes angle of light onto specimen field), field iris (changes area of illumination) or possibly objective lens (forms primary image). ''See'' [[Optical microscope]].

==In photography==
The aperture stop of a [[photographic lens]] can be adjusted to control the amount of [[light]] reaching the [[Photographic film|film]] or [[image sensor]]. In combination with variation of [[shutter speed]], the aperture size will regulate the film's or image sensor's degree of [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] to light.  Typically, a fast shutter will require a larger aperture to ensure sufficient light exposure, and a slow shutter will require a smaller aperture to avoid excessive exposure.

[[File:Aperture diagram.svg|right|thumb|350px|Diagram of decreasing aperture sizes (increasing [[f-number]]s) for &quot;full stop&quot; increments (factor of two aperture area per stop)]]

A device called a [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] usually serves as the aperture stop, and controls the aperture. The diaphragm functions much like the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] of the [[Human eye|eye]]&amp;nbsp;– it controls the effective [[diameter]] of the lens opening. Reducing the aperture size increases the [[depth of field]], which describes the extent to which subject matter lying closer than or farther from the actual plane of focus appears to be in focus. In general, the smaller the aperture (the larger the f-number), the greater the distance from the plane of focus the subject matter may be while still appearing in focus.

The lens aperture is usually specified as an [[f-number]], the ratio of [[focal length]] to effective aperture diameter. A lens typically has a set of marked &quot;f-stops&quot; that the f-number can be set to. A lower f-number denotes a greater aperture opening which allows more light to reach the film or image sensor. The photography term &quot;one f-stop&quot; refers to a factor of {{radic|2}} (approx. 1.41) change in f-number, which in turn corresponds to a factor of 2 change in light intensity.

[[Aperture priority]] is a semi-automatic shooting mode used in cameras. It permits the photographer to select an aperture setting and let the camera decide the shutter speed and sometimes also [[ISO sensitivity]] for the correct exposure. This is also referred to as Aperture Priority Auto Exposure, A mode, AV mode (aperture-value mode), or semi-auto mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://elite-cameras.com/articles/aperture-shutter-speed-digital-cameras.php | title=Aperture and shutter speed in digital cameras| work=elite-cameras.com| accessdate=20 June 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060620033626/http://elite-cameras.com/articles/aperture-shutter-speed-digital-cameras.php |archivedate = 20 June 2006}} (original link no longer works, but page was saved by archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical ranges of apertures used in photography are about {{f/}}2.8–{{f/}}22 or {{f/}}2–{{f/}}16,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photoxels.com/tutorial_aperture.html What is... Aperture?]&lt;!-- f/2 instead of f/1.8 is clearer and mathematically more accurate as 1 stop faster than f/2.8 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; covering six stops, which may be divided into wide, middle, and narrow of two stops each, roughly (using round numbers) {{f/}}2–{{f/}}4, {{f/}}4–{{f/}}8, and {{f/}}8–{{f/}}16 or (for a slower lens) {{f/}}2.8–{{f/}}5.6, {{f/}}5.6–{{f/}}11, and {{f/}}11–{{f/}}22. These are not sharp divisions, and ranges for specific lenses vary.

===Maximum and minimum apertures===
{{further|Lens speed}}
The specifications for a given lens typically include the maximum and minimum aperture sizes, for example, {{f/}}1.4–{{f/}}22. In this case, {{f/}}1.4 is the maximum aperture (the widest opening), and {{f/}}22 is the minimum aperture (the smallest opening). The maximum aperture opening tends to be of most interest and is always included when describing a lens. This value is also known as the [[lens speed|lens &quot;speed&quot;]], as it affects the exposure time. The aperture is proportional to the square root of the light admitted, and thus inversely proportional to the square root of required exposure time, such that an aperture of {{f/}}2 allows for exposure times one quarter that of {{f/}}4.

[[File:16 minolta 50mm.jpg|thumb|right|The aperture range of a 50mm Minolta lens, f/1.4–f/16]]

Lenses with apertures opening {{f/}}2.8 or wider are referred to as &quot;fast&quot; lenses, although the specific point has changed over time (for example, in the early 20th century aperture openings wider than {{f/}}6 were considered fast{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}). The fastest lenses for the common [[135 film|35 mm film]] format in general production have apertures of {{f/}}1.2 or {{f/}}1.4, with more at {{f/}}1.8 and {{f/}}2.0, and many at {{f/}}2.8 or slower; {{f/}}1.0 is unusual, though sees some use. When comparing &quot;fast&quot; lenses, the [[Film format|image format]] used must be considered. Lenses designed for a small format such as [[Half-frame camera|half frame]] or [[APS-C]] need to project a much smaller [[image circle]] than a lens used for [[Large format (photography)|large format]] photography. Thus the optical elements built into the lens can be far smaller and cheaper.

In exceptional circumstances lenses can have even wider apertures with f-numbers smaller than 1.0; see [[Lens speed#Fast lenses|lens speed: fast lenses]] for a detailed list. For instance, both the current Leica Noctilux-M 50mm ASPH and a 1960s-era Canon 50mm rangefinder lens have a maximum aperture of {{f/}}0.95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5048115/leicas-11000-noctilux-50mm-f095-lens-is-a-nightvision-owl-eye-for-your-camera|title=Leica's $11,000 Noctilux 50mm f/0.95 Lens Is a Nightvision Owl Eye For Your Camera|first=John|last=Mahoney|website=gizmodo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheaper alternatives have appeared in recent years, such as the [[Cosina Voigtländer]] 17.5mm {{f/}}0.95, 25mm {{f/}}0.95 and 42.5mm {{f/}}0.95 manual focus lenses for the [[Micro Four-Thirds System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/855215-REG/Voigtlander_BA175M_Nokton_17_5mm_f_0_95_Lens.html|title=Voigtlander Nokton 17.5mm f/0.95 Lens for Micro Four BA175M B&amp;H|website=www.bhphotovideo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/754598-REG/Voigtlander_BA305A_Nokton_25mm_f_0_95_Lens.html|title=Voigtlander BA259M2 Replacement for Voigtlander BA259M – B&amp;H|website=www.bhphotovideo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1000625-REG/voigtlander_ba425m_nokton_42_5mm_f_0_95_micro.html|title=Voigtlander Nokton 42.5mm f/0.95 Micro Four-Thirds Lens BA425M|website=www.bhphotovideo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional lenses for some movie cameras have f-numbers as small as {{f/}}0.75. [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' has scenes shot by candlelight with a NASA/Zeiss 50mm f/0.7,&lt;ref&gt;Ed DiGiulio (President, [[Cinema Products Corporation]]). [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/len/page1.htm &quot;Two Special Lenses for ''Barry Lyndon''&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt; the fastest lens in film history. Beyond the expense, these lenses have limited application due to the correspondingly shallower depth of field&amp;nbsp;– the scene must either be shallow, shot from a distance, or will be significantly defocused, though this may be the desired effect.

Zoom lenses typically have a maximum relative aperture (minimum f-number) of {{f/}}2.8 to {{f/}}6.3 through their range. High-end lenses will have a constant aperture, such as {{f/}}2.8 or {{f/}}4, which means that the relative aperture will stay the same throughout the zoom range. A more typical consumer zoom will have a variable maximum relative aperture since it is harder and more expensive to keep the maximum relative aperture proportional to the focal length at long focal lengths; {{f/}}3.5 to {{f/}}5.6 is an example of a common variable aperture range in a consumer zoom lens.

By contrast, the minimum aperture does not depend on the focal length&amp;nbsp;– it is limited by how narrowly the aperture closes, not the lens design&amp;nbsp;– and is instead generally chosen based on practicality: very small apertures have lower sharpness due to diffraction, while the added depth of field is not generally useful, and thus there is generally little benefit in using such apertures. Accordingly, DSLR lens typically have minimum aperture of {{f/}}16, {{f/}}22, or {{f/}}32, while [[large format]] may go down to {{f/}}64, as reflected in the name of [[Group f/64]]. Depth of field is a significant concern in [[macro photography]], however, and there one sees smaller apertures. For example, the [[Canon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5x Macro lens|Canon MP-E 65mm]] can have effective aperture (due to magnification) as small as {{f/}}96.  The [[Pinhole camera|pinhole]] optic for [[Lensbaby]] creative lenses has an aperture of just {{f/}}177.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lensbaby.com/optics-pinhole.php |title=Pinhole and Zone Plate Photography for SLR Cameras |work=Lensbaby Pinhole optic |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501093047/http://www.lensbaby.com/optics-pinhole.php |archivedate=1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Aperture area===
The amount of light captured by a lens is proportional to the area of the aperture, equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Area} = \pi \left({D \over 2}\right)^2 = \pi \left({f \over 2N}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Where the two equivalent forms are related via the [[f-number]] ''N = f / D'', with [[focal length]] ''f'' and aperture diameter ''D''.

The focal length value is not required when comparing two lenses of the same focal length; a value of 1 can be used instead, and the other factors can be dropped as well, leaving area proportion to the reciprocal square of the f-number ''N''.

If two cameras of different format sizes and focal lengths have the same [[angle of view]], and the same aperture area, they gather the same amount of light from the scene.  In that case, the relative focal-plane [[illuminance]], however, would depend only on the f-number ''N'', so it is less in the camera with the larger format, longer focal length, and higher f-number.  This assumes both lenses have identical transmissivity.

===Aperture control===
[[File:Aperture in Canon 50mm f1.8 II lens.jpg|thumb|right|Aperture mechanism of Canon 50mm f/1.8 II lens, with five blades]]
Though as early as 1933 [[Torkel Korling]] had invented and patented for the [[Graflex]] large format reflex camera an automatic aperture control,&lt;ref&gt;[https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/16/ca/43/f0757f2baf705f/US2029238.pdf US patent 2,029,238 Camera Mechanism, Application June 4, 1933]&lt;/ref&gt; not all early 35mm single lens reflex cameras had the feature. With a small aperture, this darkened the viewfinder, making viewing, focusing, and composition difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shipman|first=Carl|title=SLR Photographers Handbook|date=1977|publisher=HP Books|location=Tucson, AZ|isbn=0-912656-59-X|pages=[https://archive.org/details/slrphotographers05ship/page/53 53]|url=https://archive.org/details/slrphotographers05ship/page/53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korling's design enabled full-aperture viewing for accurate focus, closing to the pre-selected aperture opening when the shutter was fired and simultaneously synchronising the firing of a flash unit.   From 1956 [[SLR camera]] manufacturers separately developed ''automatic aperture control'' (the [[Miranda Camera Company|Miranda T]] 'Pressure Automatic Diaphragm', and other solutions on the [[Exakta|Exakta Varex IIa]] and [[Praktica|Praktica FX2]]) allowing viewing at the lens's maximum aperture, stopping the lens down to the working aperture at the moment of exposure, and returning the lens to maximum aperture afterward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ray2000-136&quot;&gt;Sidney F. Ray. The geometry of image formation. In ''The Manual of Photography: Photographic and Digital Imaging'', 9th ed, pp. 136–137. Ed. Ralph E. Jacobson, Sidney F. Ray, Geoffrey G. Atteridge, and Norman R. Axford. Oxford: Focal Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-240-51574-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first SLR cameras with internal ([[Through-the-lens metering|&quot;through-the-lens&quot; or &quot;TTL&quot;]]) meters (e.g., the [[Pentax Spotmatic]]) required that the lens be stopped down to the working aperture when taking a meter reading. Subsequent models soon incorporated mechanical coupling between the lens and the camera body, indicating the working aperture to the camera for exposure while allowing the lens to be at its maximum aperture for composition and focusing;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ray2000-136&quot;/&gt; this feature became known as [[open-aperture metering]].

For some lenses, including a few long [[Telephoto lens|telephotos]], lenses mounted on [[Bellows (photography)|bellows]], and [[Perspective control lens|perspective-control and tilt/shift]] lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ray2000-136&quot;/&gt; and automatic aperture control was not provided.  Many such lenses incorporated a feature known as a &quot;preset&quot; aperture,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ray2000-136&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. &quot;Moose&quot; Peterson. ''Nikon System Handbook''. New York: Images Press, 1997, pp. 42–43. {{ISBN|0-929667-03-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and full aperture without looking at the aperture control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to full aperture for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture.  Examples of lenses with this type of preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28&amp;nbsp;mm {{f/}}3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75&amp;nbsp;mm {{f/}}4.5.  The Nikon PC Micro-Nikkor 85&amp;nbsp;mm {{f/}}2.8D lens incorporates a mechanical pushbutton that sets working aperture when pressed and restores full aperture when pressed a second time.

===Optimal aperture===
Optimal aperture depends both on optics (the depth of the scene versus diffraction), and on the performance of the lens.

Optically, as a lens is stopped down, the defocus blur at the Depth of Field (DOF) limits decreases but diffraction blur increases. The presence of these two opposing factors implies a point at which the combined blur spot is minimized ([[#CITEREFR Gibson1975|Gibson 1975]], 64); at that point, the &lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt;-number is optimal for image sharpness, for this given depth of field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/technical/diffraction.html|title=Diffraction and Optimum Aperture – Format size and diffraction limitations on sharpness|website=www.bobatkins.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a wider aperture (lower ''f''-number) causes more defocus, while a narrower aperture (higher ''f''-number) causes more diffraction.

As a matter of performance, lenses often do not perform optimally when fully opened, and thus generally have better sharpness when stopped down some&amp;nbsp;– note that this is sharpness in the plane of [[critical focus]], setting aside issues of depth of field. Beyond a certain point, there is no further sharpness benefit to stopping down, and the diffraction begins to become significant. There is accordingly a sweet spot, generally in the {{f/}}4&amp;nbsp;– {{f/}}8 range, depending on lens, where sharpness is optimal, though some lenses are designed to perform optimally when wide open. How significant this varies between lenses, and opinions differ on how much practical impact this has.

While optimal aperture can be determined mechanically, how much sharpness is ''required'' depends on how the image will be used&amp;nbsp;– if the final image is viewed under normal conditions (e.g., an 8″×10″ image viewed at 10″), it may suffice to determine the &lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt;-number using criteria for minimum required sharpness, and there may be no practical benefit from further reducing the size of the blur spot.  But this may not be true if the final image is viewed under more demanding conditions, e.g., a very large final image viewed at normal distance, or a portion of an image enlarged to normal size ([[#CITEREFR Hansma1996|Hansma 1996]]).  Hansma also suggests that the final-image size may not be known when a photograph is taken, and obtaining the maximum practicable sharpness allows the decision to make a large final image to be made at a later time; see also [[critical sharpness]].

==Equivalent aperture range==
{{See also|Image sensor format}}
In digital photography, the 35mm-equivalent aperture range is sometimes considered to be more important than the actual f-number.  Equivalent aperture is the f-number adjusted to correspond to the f-number of the same size absolute aperture diameter on a lens with a [[35mm equivalent focal length]].  Smaller equivalent f-numbers are expected to lead to higher image quality based on more total light from the subject, as well as lead to reduced depth of field.  For example, a [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10]] uses a 1&quot; sensor, 24–200&amp;nbsp;mm with maximum aperture constant along the zoom range;  {{f/}}2.8 has equivalent aperture range {{f/}}7.6, which is a lower equivalent f-number than some other {{f/}}2.8 cameras with smaller sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpreview.com/previews/sony-cybershot-dsc-rx10 |title=Sony Cyber-shot DSC RX10 First Impressions Review |author=R Butler |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In scanning or sampling==
The terms ''scanning aperture'' and ''sampling aperture'' are often used to refer to the opening through which an image is sampled, or scanned, for example in a [[Drum scanner#Drum|Drum scanner]], an [[image sensor]], or a television pickup apparatus.  The sampling aperture can be a literal optical aperture, that is, a small opening in space, or it can be a time-domain aperture for [[sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] a signal waveform.

For example, [[film grain]] is quantified as ''graininess'' via a measurement of film density fluctuations as seen through a 0.048&amp;nbsp;mm sampling aperture.

An '''altimeter''' or an '''altitude meter''' is an instrument used to measure the [[altitude]] of an object above a fixed level. The measurement of altitude is called '''altimetry''', which is related to the term [[bathymetry]], the measurement of depth under water. The most common unit for altimeter calibration worldwide is [[Pascal (unit)|hectopascals]] (hPa), except for North America and Japan where [[inches of mercury]] (inHg) are used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aerosavvy.com/metric-imperial/ Aviation's Crazy, Mixed Up Units of Measure - AeroSavvy]&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain an accurate altitude reading in either feet or meters, the local barometric pressure must be calibrated correctly.

==Pressure altimeter==

Altitude can be determined based on the measurement of [[atmospheric pressure]]. The greater the altitude, the lower the pressure. When a [[barometer]] is supplied with a nonlinear calibration so as to indicate altitude, the instrument is called a pressure altimeter or barometric altimeter. A pressure altimeter is the altimeter found in most [[aircraft]], and skydivers use wrist-mounted versions for similar purposes. Hikers and mountain climbers use wrist-mounted or hand-held altimeters, in addition to other navigational tools such as a map, magnetic compass, or GPS receiver.

The calibration of an altimeter follows the equation
:&lt;math&gt;z=c\;T\;\log(P_o/P),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/altim.html|title=The use of altimeters in height measurement|first=Graham Jackson, Chris|last=Crocker|website=www.hills-database.co.uk|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025075434/http://www.hills-database.co.uk/altim.html|archivedate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where c is a constant, T is the absolute temperature, P is the pressure at altitude z, and P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the pressure at sea level. The constant c depends on the acceleration of gravity and the molar mass of the air.
However, one must be aware that this type of altimeter relies on &quot;density altitude&quot; and its readings can vary by hundreds of feet owing to a sudden change in air pressure, such as from a cold front, without any actual change in altitude.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA118 &quot;How Aircraft Instruments Work.&quot;] ''Popular Science'', March 1944, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in hiking, climbing and skiing===
A barometric altimeter, used along with a topographic map, can help to verify one's location. It is more reliable, and often more accurate, than a GPS receiver for measuring altitude; the GPS signal may be unavailable, for example, when one is deep in a canyon, or it may give wildly inaccurate altitudes when all available satellites are near the horizon. Because barometric pressure changes with the weather, hikers must periodically re-calibrate their altimeters when they reach a known altitude, such as a trail junction or peak marked on a topographical map.

===Skydiving===

An altimeter is the most important piece of [[skydiving]] equipment, after the parachute itself. Altitude awareness is crucial at all times during the jump, and determines the appropriate response to maintain safety.

Since altitude awareness is so important in skydiving, there is a wide variety of altimeter designs made specifically for use in the sport, and a non-student skydiver will typically use two or more altimeters in a single jump:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's a Skydiving Altimeter (and How Does It Work?)|url=http://skydivethewasatch.com/about/articles/whats-a-skydiving-altimeter-and-how-does-it-work/|website=Skydive The Wasatch|accessdate=2 February 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423000923/http://skydivethewasatch.com/about/articles/whats-a-skydiving-altimeter-and-how-does-it-work|archivedate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Hand, wrist or chest-mounted mechanical '''analogue visual altimeters'''. This is the most basic and common type, and is used by (and commonly mandated for) virtually all student skydivers. The common design has a face marked from 0 to 4000&amp;nbsp;m (or 0 to 12000&amp;nbsp;ft, mimicking the [[clock face]]), on which an arrow points to the current altitude. The face plate sports sections prominently marked with yellow and red respectively, signifying the recommended deployment altitude, as well as emergency procedure decision altitude (commonly known as &quot;hard deck&quot;). A mechanical altimeter has a knob that needs to be manually adjusted to make it point to 0 on the ground before jump, and if the landing spot is not at the same altitude as the takeoff spot, the user needs to adjust it appropriately. Some advanced electronic altimeters are also available which make use of the familiar analogue display, despite internally operating digitally.
* '''Digital visual altimeters''', mounted on the wrist or hand. This type always operates electronically, and conveys the altitude as a number, rather than a pointer on a dial. Since these altimeters already contain all the electronic circuitry necessary for altitude calculation, they are commonly equipped with auxiliary functions such as electronic logbook, real-time jump profile replay, speed indication, simulator mode for use in ground training, etc. An electronic altimeter is activated on the ground before  the jump, and calibrates automatically to point to 0. It is thus essential that the user not turn it on earlier than necessary to avoid, for example, the drive to a [[drop zone|dropzone]] located at a different altitude than one's home which could cause a potentially fatal false reading. If the intended landing zone is at a different elevation than the takeoff point, the user needs to input the appropriate offset by using a designated function.
* '''Audible altimeters''' (also known as &quot;dytters&quot;, a [[genericised trademark]] of the first such product on the market). These are inserted into one's helmet, and emit a warning tone at a predefined altitude. Contemporary audibles have evolved significantly from their crude beginnings, and sport a vast array of functions, such as multiple tones at different altitudes, multiple saved profiles that can be switched quickly, electronic logbook with data transfer to a [[personal computer|PC]] for later analysis, distinct free fall and canopy modes with different warning altitudes, [[Fixed-wing aircraft|swoop]] approach guiding tones, etc. Audibles are strictly auxiliary devices, and do not replace, but complement a visual altimeter which remains the primary tool for maintaining altitude awareness. The advent of modern skydiving disciplines such as [[freeflying]], in which the ground might not be in one's field of view for long periods of time, has made the use of audibles nearly universal, and virtually all skydiving helmets come with one or more built-in ports in which an audible might be placed. Audibles are not recommended and often banned from use by student skydivers, who need to build up a proper altitude awareness regime for themselves.
* '''Auxiliary visual altimeters'''. These do not show the precise altitude, but rather help maintain a general indicator in one's peripheral vision. They might either operate in tandem with an audible equipped with an appropriate port, in which case they emit warning flashes complementing the audible tones, or be standalone and use another display mode, such as showing either green or red light depending on the altitude.

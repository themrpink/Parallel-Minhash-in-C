After being ravaged by smallpox, and feeling pressure from European settlers, the Cherokee adopted a European-American [[Representative democracy]] form of government in an effort to retain their lands. They established a governmental system modeled on that of the United States, with an elected principal chief, senate, and house of representatives. On April 10, 1810 the seven Cherokee clans met and began the abolition of blood vengeance by giving the sacred duty to the new Cherokee National government. Clans formally relinquished judicial responsibilities by the 1820s when the Cherokee Supreme Court was established. In 1825, the National Council extended citizenship to the children of Cherokee men married to white women. These ideas were largely incorporated into the 1827 Cherokee constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution stated that &quot;No person who is of negro or [[mulatto]] {{sic}} parentage, either by the father or mother side, shall be eligible to hold any office of profit, honor or trust under this Government,&quot; with an exception for, &quot;negroes and descendants of white and Indian men by negro women who may have been set free.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, pp. 564–565.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition to limit rights of multiracial descendants may have been more widely held among the elite than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Cherokee tribes==

===Cherokee Nation===

[[File:Seminary Hall.jpg|thumb|The [[Cherokee Female Seminary]] was built in 1889 by the Cherokee in Indian Territory.]]
During 1898–1906 the federal government dissolved the former Cherokee Nation, to make way for the incorporation of [[Indian Territory]] into the new state of [[Oklahoma]]. From 1906 to 1975, the structure and function of the tribal government were defunct, except for the purposes of DOI management. In 1975 the tribe drafted a constitution, which they ratified on June 26, 1976,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thorpe.ou.edu/constitution/cherokee/index.html Constitution of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.] ''University of Oklahoma Law Center.'' (retrieved January 16, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and the tribe received federal recognition. 

In 1999, the CN changed or added several provisions to its constitution, among them the designation of the tribe to be &quot;Cherokee Nation,&quot; dropping &quot;of Oklahoma.&quot; According to a 2009 statement by BIA head [[Larry Echo Hawk]], the Cherokee Nation is not legally considered the &quot;historical Cherokee tribe&quot; but instead a &quot;successor in interest.&quot;  The attorney of the Cherokee Nation has stated that they intend to appeal this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Associated |first=The |url=http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/50644002.html |title=Cherokee Nation likely to appeal BIA decision &amp;#124; Indian Country Today &amp;#124; Archive |publisher=Indian Country Today |date=July 13, 2009 |access-date=April 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007233624/http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/50644002.html |archivedate=October 7, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Cherokee Nation, in recent times, has expanded economically, providing equality and prosperity for its citizens. Under the leadership of Principal Chief [[Bill John Baker]], the Nation has significant business, corporate, real estate, and agricultural interests. The CN controls Cherokee Nation Entertainment, Cherokee Nation Industries, and Cherokee Nation Businesses. CNI is a very large defense contractor that creates thousands of jobs in eastern Oklahoma for Cherokee citizens.

The CN has constructed health clinics throughout Oklahoma, contributed to community development programs, built roads and bridges, constructed learning facilities and universities for its citizens, instilled the practice of [[Gadugi]] and self-reliance, revitalized language immersion programs for its children and youth, and is a powerful and positive economic and political force in Eastern Oklahoma.

The CN hosts the [[Cherokee National Holiday]] on Labor Day weekend each year, and 80,000 to 90,000 Cherokee citizens travel to [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]], for the festivities. It publishes the ''[[Cherokee Phoenix]],'' the tribal newspaper, in both English and Cherokee, using the Sequoyah syllabary. The Cherokee Nation council appropriates money for historic foundations concerned with the preservation of Cherokee culture.

The Cherokee Nation supports the Cherokee Nation Film festivals in Tahlequah, Oklahoma and participates in the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]].

===Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians===

{{Main|Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians}}
The Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians in North Carolina, led by Chief Richard Sneed,
hosts over a million visitors a year to cultural attractions of the {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} sovereign nation. The reservation, the &quot;[[Qualla Boundary]]&quot;, has a population of over 8,000 Cherokee, primarily direct descendants of Indians who managed to avoid &quot;[[The Trail of Tears]]&quot;.

Attractions include the Oconaluftee Indian Village, Museum of the Cherokee Indian, and the Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual. Founded in 1946, the Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual is country's oldest and foremost Native American crafts cooperative.&lt;ref name=NCsmokymtns&gt;[http://www.visitsmokies.org/index.php?option=com_jumi&amp;fileid=4&amp;ID=748 Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual, Inc.], ''Smoky Mountain Host of North Carolina'' (retrieved July 1, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The outdoor drama ''[[Unto These Hills]]'', which debuted in 1950, recently broke record attendance sales. Together with Harrah's Cherokee Casino and Hotel, Cherokee Indian Hospital and Cherokee Boys Club, the tribe generated $78 million dollars in the local economy in 2005.

===United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians===

{{Main|United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians}}
The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians formed their government under the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934 and gained federal recognition in 1946. Enrollment in the tribe is limited to people with a quarter or more of Cherokee blood. Many members of the UKB are descended from Old Settlers – Cherokees who moved to Arkansas and Indian Territory before the Trail of Tears.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds, George R. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/U/UN006.html United Keetoowah Band.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720024314/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/U/UN006.html |date=July 20, 2010 }} ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.'' (retrieved October 5, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 12,000 people enrolled in the tribe, 11,000 live in Oklahoma. Their chief is Joe Bunch. 

The UKB operate a tribal casino, bingo hall, smokeshop, fuel outlets, truck stop, and gallery that showcases art and crafts made by tribal members. The tribe issues their own tribal vehicle tags.&lt;ref&gt;Oklahoma Office of Indian Affairs.

===Relations among the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes===
The Cherokee Nation participates in numerous joint programs with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. It also participates in cultural exchange programs and joint Tribal Council meetings involving councilors from both Cherokee Tribes. These are held to address issues affecting all of the Cherokee people.

The administrations of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians and the Cherokee Nation have a somewhat adversarial relationship. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians interacts with the Cherokee Nation in a unified spirit of ''[[Gadugi]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The United Keetoowah Band tribal council unanimously passed a resolution to approach the Cherokee Nation for a joint council meeting between the two Nations, as a means of &quot;offering the olive branch&quot;, in the words of the UKB Council. While a date was set for the meeting between members of the Cherokee Nation Council and UKB representative, Chad Smith, then Chief of the Cherokee Nation, refused to have the meeting.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

174 years after the [[Trail of Tears]], on July 12, 2012 the leaders of the three separate Cherokee tribes met in North Carolina.{{where|what city?|date=May 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;''[Indian Country News'', July 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary settlement==
Cherokees are most concentrated in Oklahoma and North Carolina, but some reside in the [[US West Coast]], due to economic migrations caused by the [[Dust Bowl]] during the Great Depression, job availability during the Second World War, and the [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956|Federal Indian Relocation program]] during the 1950s–1960s. Cherokees constitute over 2% of population of three largely rural communities in California–[[Covelo, California|Covelo]], [[Hayfork, California|Hayfork]] and [[San Miguel, Contra Costa County, California|San Miguel]], one town in [[Oregon]] and one town in [[Arizona]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Destinations for Cherokee diaspora included multi-ethnic/racial urban centers of California (i.e. the [[Greater Los Angeles area|Greater Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco Bay Area]]s). They frequently live in farming communities, or by military bases and other Indian reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epodunk.com/ancestry/Cherokee.html |title=Cherokee Ancestry Search – Cherokee Genealogy by City |publisher=ePodunk.com |access-date=April 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730015224/http://www.epodunk.com/ancestry/Cherokee.html |archive-date=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership controversies==

===Tribal recognition and membership===
{{Main|Cherokee Heritage Groups}}
The three Cherokee tribes have differing requirements for enrollment. The Cherokee Nation determines enrollment by lineal descent from Cherokees listed on the [[Dawes Rolls]] and has no minimum [[blood quantum]] requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cherokee.org/home.aspx?section=services&amp;service=Registration&amp;ID=8sRG9ZCF7PE= Cherokee Nation Registration] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718074313/http://www.cherokee.org/home.aspx?section=services&amp;service=Registration&amp;ID=8sRG9ZCF7PE= |date=July 18, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, descendants of the Dawes Cherokee Freedman rolls are members of the tribe, pending court decisions. The Cherokee Nation includes numerous members who have mixed ancestry, including African-American, Latino American, Asian American, European-American, and other. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum one-sixteenth Cherokee blood quantum (genealogical descent, equivalent to one great-great-grandparent) and an ancestor on the Baker Roll. The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum one-quarter Keetoowah Cherokee blood quantum (equivalent to one grandparent). The UKB does not allow members who have relinquished their membership to re-enroll in the UKB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keetoowahcherokee.org/enrollment.html Enrollment.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609034110/http://www.keetoowahcherokee.org/enrollment.html |date=June 9, 2010 }} ''United Keetoowah Band of Cherokees.'' (retrieved October 5, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the U.S. census reported 875,276 people identified as Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.census.gov/prod/2006pubs/censr-28.pdf |title=''We the People: American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United States'' }}, Census 2000 Special Reports, [[United States Census Bureau]]&lt;/ref&gt; But, 316,049 people are enrolled as citizens of the federally recognized Cherokee tribes.

Over 200 groups claim to be Cherokee nations, tribes, or bands.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Eddie. [http://www.tahlequahdailypress.com/cnhi/tahlequahdailypress/features/local_story_006134311.html?keyword=secondarystory &quot;A League of Nations?&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20090620174702/http://www.tahlequahdailypress.com/cnhi/tahlequahdailypress/features/local_story_006134311.html?keyword=secondarystory |date=June 20, 2009 }} ''Tahlequah Daily Press.'' January 6, 2006 (retrieved October 5, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Cherokee Nation spokesman Mike Miller has suggested that some groups, which he calls [[Cherokee Heritage Groups]], are encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, are controversial for their attempts to gain economically through their claims to be Cherokee. The three federally recognized groups note that they are the only groups having the legal right to present themselves as Cherokee Indian Tribes and only their enrolled members are legally Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;Official Statement Cherokee Nation 2000, Pierpoint 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception to this may be the [[Texas Cherokee]]. Before 1975, they were considered part of the Cherokee Nation, as reflected in briefs filed before the [[Indian Claims Commission]]. At one time W.W. Keeler served as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation and, at the same time, held the position as Chairman of the Texas Cherokee and Associated Bands (TCAB) Executive Committee.

Following the adoption of the Cherokee constitution in 1976, TCAB descendants whose ancestors had remained a part of the physical Mount Tabor Community in [[Rusk County, Texas]] were excluded from CN citizenship. Because they had already migrated from Indian Territory at the time of the [[Dawes Commission]], their ancestors were not recorded on the Final Rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes, which serve as the basis for tracing descent for many individuals. But, most if not all TCAB descendants did have an ancestor listed on either the Guion-Miller or [[Old settler (Cherokee)|Old settler]] rolls.

While most Mount Tabor residents returned to the Cherokee Nation after the Civil War and following the death of [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] in 1866, in the 21st century, there is a sizable group that is well documented but outside that body. It is not actively seeking a status clarification. They have treaty rights going back to the [[Treaty of Bird's Fort]]. From the end of the Civil War until 1975, they were associated with the Cherokee Nation. 

The TCAB formed as a political organization in 1871 led by [[William Penn Adair]] and Clement Neely Vann. Descendants of the Texas Cherokees and the Mount Tabor Community joined together to try to gain redress from treaty violations, stemming from the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1836. Today, most Mount Tabor descendants are members of the Cherokee Nation. Some 800 persons do not have status as Cherokee; many of these still reside in Rusk and Smith counties of east Texas.{[citation needed|date=Nov 2020}}

Other remnant populations continue to exist throughout the Southeast United States and individually in the states surrounding Oklahoma. Many of these people trace descent from persons enumerated on official rolls such as the Guion-Miller, Drennan, Mullay, and Henderson Rolls, among others. Other descendants trace their heritage through the treaties of 1817 and 1819 with the federal government that gave individual land allotments to Cherokee households.  State-recognized tribes may have different membership requirements and genealogical documentation than to the federally recognized ones. 

Current enrollment guidelines of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma have been approved by the US [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. The CN noted such facts during the Constitutional Convention held &lt;!-- when? --&gt;to ratify a new governing document. The document was eventually ratified by a small portion of the electorate. Any changes to the tribe's enrollment procedures must be approved by the Department of Interior. Under 25 CFR 83 the Office of Federal Acknowledgment is required to first apply its own anthropological, genealogical, and historical research methods to any request for change by the tribe. It forwards its recommendations to the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/aoc.htm Act of Congress Roll, 1854]

===Cherokee Freedmen===
{{Main|Cherokee Freedmen Controversy}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CNSeal.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The seal of the Cherokee Nation.]] --&gt;

The Cherokee freedmen, descendants of African American slaves owned by citizens of the Cherokee Nation during the [[Antebellum Period]], were first guaranteed Cherokee citizenship under a treaty with the United States in 1866. This was in the wake of the [[American Civil War]], when the U.S. emancipated slaves and passed US constitutional amendments granting freedmen citizenship in the United States.

In 1988, the federal court in the Freedmen case of ''Nero v. Cherokee Nation''&lt;ref&gt;https://casetext.com/case/nero-v-cherokee-nation-of-oklahoma&lt;/ref&gt; held that Cherokees could decide citizenship requirements and exclude freedmen. On March 7, 2006, the Cherokee Nation Judicial Appeal Tribunal ruled that the Cherokee Freedmen were eligible for Cherokee citizenship. This ruling proved controversial; while the Cherokee Freedman had historically been recorded as &quot;citizens&quot; of the Cherokee Nation at least since 1866 and the later [[Dawes Commission]] Land Rolls, the ruling &quot;did not limit membership to people possessing Cherokee blood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freedman-Decision&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedman Decision |url=http://www.cherokee.org/docs/news/Freedman-Decision.pdf |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213034721/http://www.cherokee.org/docs/news/Freedman-Decision.pdf |archivedate=February 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling was consistent with the 1975 Constitution of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, in its acceptance of the Cherokee Freedmen on the basis of historical citizenship, rather than documented blood relation.

On March 3, 2007, a constitutional amendment was passed by a Cherokee vote limiting citizenship to Cherokees on the Dawes Rolls for those listed as Cherokee by blood on the Dawes roll, which did not include partial Cherokee descendants of slaves, Shawnee and Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cherokeecourts.com/Portals/5/44%20-%20Motion%20for%20Summary%20Judgment%20and%20Brief%20in%20Support.pdf Cherokee Constitutional Amendment March 3, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304002421/http://www.cherokeecourts.com/Portals/5/44%20-%20Motion%20for%20Summary%20Judgment%20and%20Brief%20in%20Support.pdf |date=March 4, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cherokee Freedmen had 90 days to appeal this amendment vote which disenfranchised them from Cherokee citizenship and file appeal within the Cherokee Nation Tribal Council, which is currently pending in ''Nash, et al. v. Cherokee Nation Registrar''. On May 14, 2007, the Cherokee Freedmen were reinstated as citizens of the Cherokee Nation by the Cherokee Nation Tribal Courts through a temporary order and temporary injunction until the court reached its final decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cherokeecourts.com/Portal/5/44%20-%20Motion%20for%20Summary%20Judgment%20and%20Brief%20in%20Support.pdf | title= Nash, et al v. Cherokee Nation Registrar }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 14, 2011, the tribal district court ruled that the 2007 constitutional amendment was invalid because it conflicted with the 1866 treaty guaranteeing the Freedmen's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Off, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=14&amp;articleid=20110114_14_0_AChero292984 &quot;Judge grants Cherokee citizenship to non-Indian freedmen&quot;], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', January 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clapham Sect''', or '''Clapham Saints''', were a group of [[Church of England]] social reformers based in [[Clapham]], [[London]], in the early 19th century (active 1780s–1840s).

The members of the Clapham group were chiefly prominent and wealthy [[Evangelical Anglicanism|Evangelical Anglicans]] who shared common political and social views concerning the [[Abolitionism|liberation of slaves]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann M.  Burton, &quot;British Evangelicals, Economic Warfare and the Abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1794–1810.&quot; ''Anglican and Episcopal History'' 65#2 (1996): 197–225. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42611776 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; the abolition of the [[slave trade]] and the [[Prison reform|reform of the penal system]], amongst other issues, and who worked laboriously towards these ends over many years, motivated by their [[Christian faith]] and concern for [[social justice]] and fairness for all.

==Campaigns and successes==
The group's name originates from the members who had settled in [[Clapham]], then a village south of London (today part of south-west London), where both Wilberforce and Thornton, the sect's two most influential leaders, resided and where many of the group's meetings were held, and particularly those attending Holy Trinity Church on [[Clapham Common]], then surrounded by fashionable villas.

[[Henry Venn (Clapham Sect)|Henry Venn]], the founder of the Clapham group, was curate at Holy Trinity (1754) and his son John became rector (1792–1813). [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]] and [[Henry Thornton (reformer)|Henry Thornton]], two of the group's most influential leaders, resided nearby and many of the meetings were held in their houses. They were encouraged by [[Beilby Porteus]], the [[Bishop of London]], himself an [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] and reformer, who sympathised with many of their aims.  The term &quot;Clapham Sect&quot; was a later invention by [[James Stephen (civil servant)|James Stephen]] in an article of 1844 which celebrated and romanticised the work of these reformers.&lt;ref&gt;Gathro, John [http://www.cslewisinstitute.org/webfm_send/471 &quot;William Wilberforce and His Circle of Friends&quot;], ''CS Lewis Institute''. Retrieved 31 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The reformers were partly composed of members from [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]] and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], where the Vicar of [[Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge|Holy Trinity Church]], [[Charles Simeon]] had preached to students from the [[Cambridge University|university]], some of whom underwent an evangelical [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]] experience and later became associated with the Clapham Sect.

Lampooned in their day as &quot;the saints&quot;, the group published a journal, the ''[[Christian Observer]]'', edited by [[Zachary Macaulay]] and were also credited with the foundation of several [[missionary]] and tract societies, including the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] and the [[Church Missionary Society]].

After many decades of work both in British society and in [[British Parliament|Parliament]], the reformers saw their efforts rewarded with the final passage of the [[Slave Trade Act]] in 1807, banning the trade throughout the [[British Empire]] and, after many further years of campaigning, the total emancipation of British slaves with the passing of the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. They also campaigned vigorously for Britain to use its influence to work towards [[Abolitionism|abolishing]] [[slavery]] throughout the world.

Some of the group, [[Granville Sharp]], [[Thomas Clarkson]] and William Wilberforce, were responsible for the founding in 1787 of [[Sierra Leone]] as a settlement for some of the African-Americans freed by the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]]; it thus became the first major [[Crown colony|British colony]] in Africa, whose purpose in Clarkson's words was &quot;the abolition of the slave trade, the civilisation of Africa, and the introduction of the gospel there&quot;.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt;{{rp|11}} Later, in 1792, another of the group [[John Clarkson]] was instrumental in the creation of its capital [[Freetown]].

The group are described by the historian Stephen Tomkins as &quot;a network of friends and families in England, with [[William Wilberforce]] as its centre of gravity, who were powerfully bound together by their shared moral and spiritual values, by their religious mission and social activism, by their love for each other, and by marriage&quot;.&lt;ref name=tom&gt;Tomkins, (2010) ''The Clapham Sect: How Wilberforce’s circle changed Britain'',&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1848 when [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] bishop [[John Bird Sumner]] became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], it is said that between a quarter and a third of Anglican clergy were linked to the movement, which by then had diversified greatly in its goals, although they were no longer considered an organised faction.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd Hilton, ''A Mad, Bad, Dangerous People? England 1783–1846'' (2006), p 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other societies that members of the group founded or were involved with included the [[Anti-Slavery Society]], the [[Abolition Society]], the [[Proclamation Society]], the [[Sunday School Society]], the [[Bettering Society]], and the [[Small Debt Society]].

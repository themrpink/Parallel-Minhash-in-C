However, British Foreign Secretary [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] said:

{{quote|I have been asked over and over again to clarify, modify or improve the wording, but I do not intend to do that. The phrasing of the Resolution was very carefully worked out, and it was a difficult and complicated exercise to get it accepted by the UN Security Council. I formulated the Security Council Resolution. Before we submitted it to the Council, we showed it to Arab leaders. The proposal said 'Israel will withdraw from territories that were occupied', and not from 'the' territories, which means that Israel will not withdraw from all the territories.&lt;ref&gt;The Jerusalem Post, 23 January 1970&lt;/ref&gt;}}
===The PLO===

The  day  after  Resolution  242  was  adopted,  the  Palestine  Liberation  Organization  (PLO) rejected it as &quot;fundamentally  and  gravely  inconsistent  with  the  Arab  character  of  Palestine, the essence of the Palestine cause and the right of the Palestinian people to their homeland.&quot; and &quot;disappoints the hopes of the Arab nation and ignores its national aspirations [... and] ignores the existence of the Palestinian people and their right of self-determination.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jr.2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert P.

At the 12th PNC in Cairo on 8 June 1974, the PLO adopted the [[PLO's Ten Point Program|Ten-Point Program]].Some hardline factions split away to form the [[Rejectionist Front]] [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29362505] On the same day the PNC recommended to the PLO executive committee participation in [[Geneva_Conference_(1973)|the Geneva process]]. While reiterating its rejection of UN 242 the PLO should engage in a &quot;framework other than that of resolution 242.&quot; The Program, a compromise with rejectionists, marked the first official PLO document that suggested the feasibility of a two-state solution. While Israel was not likely to accept such conditions, the document suggested compromise. According to scholar Shaul Mishal, &quot;a real shift in the PLO position towards the occupied territories;unequivocal support for military struggle has ever since been supplemented by a willingness to consider political means as well.&quot; Although a minority, the creation of the Rejectionist Front enabled an argument that the PLO did not speak for all Palestinians and so should not participate at Geneva.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chamberlin2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Thomas Chamberlin|title=The Global Offensive: The United States, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the Making of the Post-Cold War Order|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kOIePd-oToMC|date=18 October 2012|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-981139-7|pages = 238–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BlackMorris1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ian Black|author2=Benny Morris|title=Israel's Secret Wars: A History of Israel's Intelligence Services|url=https://archive.org/details/israelssecretwar00blac|url-access=registration|year=1991|publisher=Grove Weidenfeld|isbn=978-0-8021-3286-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 1974, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3236]] recognized the right of the Palestinian people to [[self-determination]], [[Independence|national independence]] and [[sovereignty]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It also recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and accorded it [[United Nations General Assembly observers#Palestine|observer]] status in the United Nations. In 1975, as part of the [[Sinai Interim Agreement|Sinai II agreement]], Kissinger had promised Israel that the United States would not deal with the PLO until it recognized Israel’s right to exist and accepted United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0331/1553991.pdf 1975 Israel-United States Memorandum of Understanding]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1978 [[Camp David Accords]] attempted to address the Palestinian problem but there continued to be no direct Palestinian representation.

The 1988 [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] included a PNC call for multilateral negotiations on the basis of [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]] later known as &quot;the Historic Compromise&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carim.org/public/polsoctexts/PS2PAL005_EN.pdf |title=The Historic Compromise: The Palestinian Declaration of Independence and the Twenty-Year Struggle for a Two-State Solution |author=PLO Negotiations Affairs Department |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022554/http://www.carim.org/public/polsoctexts/PS2PAL005_EN.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; implying acceptance of a two-state solution and no longer questioning the legitimacy of the [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref name=Quigleyp212&gt;Quigley, 2005, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The PNC called only for withdrawal from [[East Jerusalem|Arab Jerusalem]] and &quot;Arab territories occupied.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-bab.com/arab/docs/pal/pal4.htm Political communique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420191313/http://www.al-bab.com/arab/docs/pal/pal4.htm |date=2001-04-20 }} Palestine National Council.

For the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]] Israel still refused to deal directly with the PLO and the Palestinians formed part of a joint delegation with Jordan. Finally, in the 1993 Declaration of Principles and the subsequent Israeli-Palestinian agreements, Israel and the PLO each recognized the other and agreed terms of reference as Resolutions  242 and 338.

===Statements by Security Council representatives===

The representative for [[India]] stated to the Security Council:

{{quote|It is our understanding that the draft resolution, if approved by the Council, will commit it to the application of the principle of total withdrawal of Israel forces from all the territories&amp;nbsp;– I repeat, all the territories&amp;nbsp;– occupied by Israel as a result of the conflict which began on 5 June 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP1382&quot;/&gt;}}

The representatives from [[Nigeria]], [[France]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Bulgaria]], [[United Arab Republic]] (Egypt), [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], [[Jordan]], [[Argentina]] and [[Mali]] supported this view, as worded by the representative from Mali: &quot;[Mali] wishes its vote today to be interpreted in the light of the clear and unequivocal interpretation which the representative of India gave of the provisions of the United Kingdom text.&quot; The Russian representative [[Vasili Vasilyevich Kuznetsov|Vasili Kuznetsov]] stated:

{{quote|We understand the decision taken to mean the withdrawal of Israel forces from all, and we repeat, all territories belonging to Arab States and seized by Israel following its attack on those States on 5 June 1967. This is borne out by the preamble to the United Kingdom draft resolution [S/8247] which stresses the &quot;inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war&quot;. It follows that the provision contained in that draft relating to the right of all States in the Near East &quot;to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries&quot; cannot serve as a pretext for the maintenance of Israel forces on any part of the Arab territories seized by them as a result of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP1382&quot;/&gt;}}

[[Israel]] was the only country represented at the Security Council to express a contrary view. The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Taiwan|China]] and [[Japan]] were silent on the matter, but the US and UK did point out that other countries' comments on the meaning of 242 were simply their own views. The [[Syria]]n representative was strongly critical of the text's &quot;vague call on Israel to withdraw&quot;.

The statement by the Brazilian representative perhaps gives a flavour of the complexities at the heart of the discussions:

{{quote|I should like to restate...the general principle that no stable international order can be based on the threat or use of force, and that the occupation or acquisition of territories brought about by such means should not be recognized...Its acceptance does not imply that borderlines cannot be rectified as a result of an agreement freely concluded among the interested States. We keep constantly in mind that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East has necessarily to be based on secure permanent boundaries freely agreed upon and negotiated by the neighboring States.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP1382&quot;/&gt;}}

However, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] delegate [[Vasili Vasilyevich Kuznetsov|Vasily Kuznetsov]] argued: &quot; ... phrases such as 'secure and recognized boundaries'. ... make it possible for Israel itself arbitrarily to establish new boundaries and to withdraw its forces only to those lines it considers appropriate.&quot; [1373rd meeting, para. 152.]

[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court Justice]] [[Arthur Goldberg]], who represented the US in discussions, later stated: &quot;The notable omissions in regard to withdrawal are the word 'the' or 'all' and 'the June 5, 1967 lines' the resolution speaks of withdrawal from occupied territories, without defining the extent of withdrawal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Meaning of 242,&quot; June 10, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
On November 23, 1967, the [[Secretary General]] appointed [[Gunnar Jarring]] as Special Envoy to negotiate the implementation of the resolution with the parties, the so-called [[Jarring Mission]]. The governments of [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]] and [[Lebanon]] recognized Jarring's appointment and agreed to participate in his shuttle diplomacy, although they differed on key points of interpretation of the resolution. The government of [[Syria]] rejected Jarring's mission on grounds that total Israeli withdrawal was a prerequisite for further negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sixdaywar.org/content/242response.asp Resolution 242: Response from the affected parties] www.sixdaywar.org&lt;/ref&gt; The talks under Jarring's auspices lasted until 1973, but bore no results. After 1973, the Jarring mission was replaced by bilateral and multilateral peace conferences.

&lt;!--
Fictional narratives (and works of art) exist beyond their completion, e.g. ''A Tale of Two Cities'' is a novel (we do not say ''A Tale of Two Cities'' was a novel), The Mona Lisa is a painting (we do not say the Mona Lisa was a painting). They were completed in the past we can say ''A Tale of Two Cities'' was completed in the 19th century, but we cannot say it was a novel, it is a novel.

Here is a passage from [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)]] which hints at why this is so:

&quot;The story that each work of fiction depicts does not change despite the continuation of stories across serial works or sequels, and as a consequence, the events within one work of fiction are always in the present whenever it is read, watched, or listened to.&quot;

Please do not change the tense in this passage without contributing to discussion on the talk page, [[Talk:Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].
--&gt;'''''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''''' &lt;!-- read above before changing tense --&gt;is &lt;!-- read above before changing tense --&gt; an American [[supernatural fiction|supernatural drama]] television series based on the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|1992 film of the same name]]. It was created by [[Joss Whedon]] under his production tag, [[Mutant Enemy Productions]], with later co-executive producers being [[Jane Espenson]], [[David Fury]], [[David Greenwalt]], [[Doug Petrie]], [[Marti Noxon]], and [[David Solomon (TV producer)|David Solomon]].

The series premiered on March 10, 1997, on [[The WB]] and concluded on May 20, 2003, on [[UPN]]. The series narrative follows [[Buffy Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), the latest in a line of young women known as &quot;Vampire Slayers&quot;, or simply &quot;[[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]s&quot;. In the story, Slayers, or the &quot;Chosen Ones&quot;, are chosen by fate to battle against vampires, demons and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who guides, teaches and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the &quot;Scooby Gang&quot;.

The series received critical and popular acclaim and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-tv-shows-of-all-time-2017-6#buffy-the-vampire-slayer-1997-to-2003-12|title=50 TV shows everyone should watch in their lifetime|work=INSIDER|first=Jacob|last=Shamsian|date=March 8, 2018|access-date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;insightbb-buffy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Wahoske, Matthew J. |url=http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043137/http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |title=Nielsen Ratings For Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, And Firefly |work=Insightbb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although such ratings are lower than successful shows on the &quot;big four&quot; networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01133.txt |title=The Dual Network Rule |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=May 15, 2001 |quote=[T]he four major broadcast networks are unique among the media in their ability to reach a wide audience}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf#search=%22%20Dawson's%20Creek%2C%20Buffy%20is%20often%20associated%20with%20the%20early%20success%20of%20the%20Warner%20Brothers%20Network.%22 |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8–18 Year Olds |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=March 9, 2005 |quote=Mr. Levin was a key player in establishing The WB's distinct brand and youth appeal through programming such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'' and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
{{Main|List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters|List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters|List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings}}

[[Buffy Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) is the &quot;[[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]&quot;, one in a long line of young women chosen by [[destiny|fate]] to battle evil forces. This mystical calling grants her powers that dramatically increase physical strength, endurance, agility, accelerated healing, intuition, and a limited degree of [[precognition]], usually in the form of [[prophecy|prophetic]] dreams. She has returned from death twice and is known as a reluctant hero who wants to live a normal life. However, she learns to embrace her destiny as the vampire slayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tribute.ca/news/photo-galleries/sexiest-female-superheroes-and-supervillains/buffy-summers-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-1997-2003/ |title=Buffy Summers – Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003) - Sexiest Female Superheroes and Supervillains |website=Tribute.ca |language=en|access-date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-is-a-role-model-for-the-resistance-8015815 |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a Role Model for the Resistance |last=Barlow |first=Eve |date=March 11, 2017 |work=L.A. Weekly|access-date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffy receives guidance from her [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], [[Rupert Giles]] ([[Anthony Head|Anthony Stewart Head]]). Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his rebellious younger days he went by &quot;Ripper&quot;), is a member of the [[Watchers' Council]], whose job is to train and guide the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offers insights into their origins and advice on how to defeat them, and helps her train to stay in fighting form.

Buffy is also helped by friends she meets at Sunnydale High: [[Willow Rosenberg]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) and [[Xander Harris]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]). Willow is originally a [[Wallflower (people)|wallflower]] who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional young women. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and [[coming out|comes out]] as a [[lesbian]]. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural abilities, provides [[comic relief]] and a grounded perspective. It is Xander who often provides the heart to the series, and in season six, becomes the hero in place of Buffy who defeats the &quot;[[Big Bad]]&quot;. Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in [[Conversations with Dead People|only one]].

The cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, [[Joyce Summers]] (portrayed by [[Kristine Sutherland]]), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers' lives even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world (&quot;[[Becoming, Part Two]]&quot;). Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers]] ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is introduced in season five (&quot;[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]&quot;). A vampire tortured with a soul in return for horrific deeds committed in the past to many, including a young gypsy girl and her family, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] (portrayed by [[David Boreanaz]]), is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy after realizing he will never be able to give her a normal life. He goes on to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, including the last episode.

At Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the &quot;Scooby Gang&quot; or &quot;Scoobies&quot;. [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved. [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel &quot;Oz&quot; Osbourne]] ([[Seth Green]]), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. [[Jenny Calendar]] ([[Robia LaMorte]]), Sunnydale's computer science teacher, joins the group after helping destroy a demon trapped in cyberspace during season 1. She later becomes Giles' love interest. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] ([[Emma Caulfield]]), a former vengeance demon (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers and joins the group in season four.

In Buffy's senior year at high school, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), the other current Slayer, who was &quot;called&quot; forth when Slayer [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra Young]] ([[Bianca Lawson]]) was killed by vampire [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] ([[Juliet Landau]]), in season two. Although Faith initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she comes to stand against them and sides with [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]] ([[Harry Groener]]) after accidentally killing a human in season three. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' where she voluntarily goes to jail for her murders. Faith reappears in season seven of ''Buffy'', after having helped Angel and his crew, and fights alongside Buffy against The First Evil.

Buffy gathers other allies: [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus (Angel) and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his [[Billy Idol]]-style [[peroxide blond]] hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, [[Nikki Wood]]; her son, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]] ([[D. B. Woodside]]), joins the group in the final season. [[Tara Maclay]] ([[Amber Benson]]) is a fellow member of Willow's [[Wicca]] group during season four, and their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship. Buffy becomes involved personally and professionally with [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]), a military operative in &quot;the Initiative&quot;, which hunts demons using science and technology. The final season sees [[geek]]y wannabe-villain [[Andrew Wells]] ([[Tom Lenk]]) come to side with the Scoobies after initially being their captive/hostage; they regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.

''Buffy'' featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example, the &quot;Big Bad&quot; (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]] is a character who appeared in 12 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters who attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.

===Setting and filming locations===
{{Main|Sunnydale}}
[[File:Torrance High School.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Torrance High School]] was used for the fictional Sunnydale High School.]]
The show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban [[Sunnydale High|Sunnydale High School]] sits on top of a &quot;Hellmouth&quot;, a gateway to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the school library, is a source of mystical energies as well as a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and &quot;[[High school (North America)|High school]] as [[Hell]]&quot; as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.&lt;ref&gt;Yovanovich, Linda, &quot;Young Blood&quot;, ''Smgfan.com'', originally from ''OnSat'' (July 14, 1997), Whedon said: &quot;[High school as hell] was always the basis of the show. When they said, 'Do you want to turn it into a show?' The character was not enough alone to sustain it. But you know when I thought of the idea of the horror movies as a metaphor for high school, [I said] okay this is something that will work week to week.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of ''Buffy'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The high school used in the first three seasons is actually [[Torrance High School]], in [[Torrance, California]], the same high school used for [[Beverly Hills, 90210]].&lt;ref name=&quot;torrence&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/buffy.html Buffy the Vampire Slayer film locations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225538/http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/buffy.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&quot;, ''Movie-locations.com''&lt;/ref&gt; The show was initially very dependent on location shooting, because the production budget allowed for few permanent sets to be built.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1998&quot;&gt;{{cite video |title=Designing Buffy Featurette |medium=dvd |year=1998 |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Season One this was limited to the interior of Sunnydale High (the library, hallways, and classrooms), Buffy's bedroom, and the Master's underground lair. From Season Two more permanent sets were built, including the full interior of Buffy's house, Angel's mansion, Giles' apartment, and extensions to the high school set (the addition of a dining hall and commons area).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1998&quot;/&gt; A driveway area near the gated entrance to Fox Studios was transformed into a graveyard.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1998&quot;/&gt; In Season Three the Sunnydale &quot;Main Street&quot; was constructed on the backlot, which would be a staple location for the rest of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Watcher's Guide Vol. 2: Interview with Production Designer Casey Meyers |author=Nancy Holder |year=2000 |page=355–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the show transitioned to college in the fourth season, the hallway sets from Sunnydale High were remodeled to appear as the interior hallways of UC Sunnydale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Designing Buffy Season 4 Featurette |medium=dvd |year=2000 |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the exterior shots of the college Buffy attends, UC Sunnydale, were filmed at [[UCLA]]. Several episodes include shots from the Oviatt Library at [[CSUN]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CSUN WIKI&quot;&gt;Various authors, &quot;[[California State University, Northridge#Film and television shoots]]&quot;, &quot;California State University, Northridge: Film &amp; Television Shoots&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BUFFY CSUN&quot;&gt;CSUN Oviatt Library Website, &quot;[http://library.csun.edu/About/InMedia]&quot;, &quot;Oviatt Library In The Media&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior of the mansion where Angelus, Spike, and Drusilla lived was [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s [[Ennis House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-angels-house-has-been-saved/ |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Angel's House Has Been Saved |publisher=TV Series Finale |first=Trevor |last=Kimball |date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Format===
''Buffy'' is told in a [[Serial (radio and television)|serialized]] format, with each episode involving a self-contained story while contributing to a larger [[story arc|storyline]],&lt;ref name=&quot;FtF-Intro&quot; /&gt; which is broken down into season-long narratives marked by the rise and defeat of a powerful [[antagonist]], commonly referred to as the &quot;[[Big Bad]]&quot;. While the show is mainly a [[drama]] with frequent [[comic relief]], most episodes blend different [[genre]]s, including [[horror film|horror]], [[martial arts]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[melodrama]], [[farce]], [[science fiction]], [[Screwball comedy film|comedy]], and even, in [[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|one episode]], [[musical comedy]].

The series' narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends, collectively dubbed the &quot;Scooby Gang&quot;, who struggle to balance the fight against [[supernatural]] evils with their complex social lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;FtF-Intro&quot; /&gt; The show mixes complex, season-long storylines with a [[Villain of the week|villain-of-the-week]] format; a typical episode contains one or more [[villain]]s, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]]ine. Gellar described the show as &quot;the ultimate metaphor: horrors of adolescence manifesting through these actual monsters. It's the hardest time of life.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Guardian 21 July 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/21/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-to-be-remade-21-years-after-first-episode |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer to be remade 21 years after first episode |date=July 21, 2018 |accessdate=July 22, 2018 |first=Vanessa |last=Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first few seasons, the most prominent monsters in the [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|''Buffy'' bestiary]] are [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. As the series continues, Buffy and her companions fight an increasing variety of [[Grimslaw demon|demons]], as well as [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Ghosts and spirits|ghosts]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Undead|zombies]], and [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Dangerous mortals|unscrupulous humans]]. They frequently save the world from annihilation by a combination of physical combat, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and detective-style investigation, and are guided by an extensive collection of ancient and mystical reference books. &lt;!-- The passage contained in the following wiki code comment field was part of the article text, but do not present well when reading before subsequent sections, so they are removed until more appropriate position (further along) within the article is identified. --&gt;&lt;!-- Hand-to-hand combat is chiefly undertaken by Buffy and Angel, later by [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]], and to a far lesser degree by Giles and Xander. Willow eventually becomes an adept [[Witch (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|witch]], while Giles contributes his extensive knowledge of [[demonology]] and supernatural lore. --&gt;

Other accounts suggested that, possibly in addition to Trollope's deception, York was fooled by some of John Neville of Raby's forces displaying false colours into thinking that reinforcements sent by Warwick had arrived. By another contemporary account, [[William Worcester]]'s ''Annales Rerum Anglicorum'', John Neville himself obtained a Commission of Array from Richard of York to raise 8,000 men to fight on York's side under the Earl of Westmoreland.&lt;ref name=Goodwin145/&gt; Having gathered this force and enticed York to leave the castle to rendezvous with him, John Neville then defected to the Lancastrians.&lt;ref name=Dockray10/&gt;

Another suggestion was that York and Somerset had agreed a truce during Christmas until 6 January, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Epiphany]], but the Lancastrians had no intention of honouring the truce. On three successive days, they sent heralds to provoke York into premature action with insulting messages&lt;ref&gt;Weir (1995), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; and when York moved into the open the Lancastrians treacherously attacked earlier than had been agreed, catching York at a disadvantage while many of his men were absent foraging for supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Charles. ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest suggestion was that York acted rashly.&lt;ref name=Rowse143/&gt; For example, historian [[John Sadler (historian)|John Sadler]] states that there was no Lancastrian deception or ambush; York led his men from the castle on a foraging expedition (or by popular belief, to rescue some of his foragers who were under attack)&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2016), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; and as successive Lancastrian contingents joined the battle (the last being Clifford's division, encamped south and east of Sandal Magna), York's army was outnumbered, surrounded and overwhelmed.&lt;ref name=Sadler60&gt;Sadler (2011), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yorkists marched out of Sandal Castle down the present-day Manygates Lane towards the Lancastrians located to the north of the castle. It is generally accepted that, as York engaged the Lancastrians to his front, others attacked him from the flank and rear, cutting him off from the castle. In Edward Hall's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;but when he was in the plain ground between his castle and the town of Wakefield, he was environed on every side, like a fish in a net, or a deer in a buckstall; so that he manfully fighting was within half an hour slain and dead, and his whole army discomfited.&lt;ref name=Dockray12&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Casualties===
One near-contemporary source (''Gregory's Chronicle'') claimed that 2,500 Yorkists and 200 Lancastrians were killed, but other sources give wildly differing figures, from 2,200 to only 700 Yorkist dead.

The Duke of York was either killed in the battle or captured and immediately executed. Some later works support the folklore that he suffered a crippling wound to the knee and was unhorsed, and he and his closest followers then fought to the death at that spot;&lt;ref name=Sadler60/&gt; others relate the account that he was taken prisoner (by one Sir James Luttrell of Devonshire), mocked by his captors and beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Jones| first=Dan| title=The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses and the Rise of the Tudors| publisher=Faber &amp; Faber| year=2014| isbn=9780571288090| page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]] attempted to escape over Wakefield Bridge, but was overtaken and killed, possibly by Clifford in revenge for his father's death at St Albans. Salisbury's second son [[Thomas Neville (died 1460)|Sir Thomas Neville]] also died in the battle.&lt;ref name=Rowse144/&gt; Salisbury's son in law [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington|William, Lord Harington]] and Harington's father, William Bonville, were captured and executed immediately after the battle. (The Bonvilles had been engaged in a [[Bonville–Courtenay feud|feud]] with the Earl of Devon and the Courtenay family in Devon and Cornwall.) Salisbury himself escaped the battlefield but was captured during the night, and was taken to the Lancastrian camp. Although the Lancastrian nobles might have been prepared to allow Salisbury to ransom himself, he was dragged out of Pontefract Castle and beheaded by local commoners, to whom he had been a harsh overlord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mob may have been led by the &quot;Bastard of Exeter&quot;, an illegitimate son of the Duke of Exeter.&lt;ref name=Seward83/&gt;

Among the &quot;commoners&quot; in York's army who were killed was John Harrowe, a prominent [[Worshipful Company of Mercers|mercer]] of London, described as a &quot;captain of the foot&quot;.&lt;ref name=Seward83/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Richard of York Memorial Inscription - geograph.org.uk - 858006.jpg|right|thumb|Monument to Richard of York]]
After the battle the heads of York, Rutland and Salisbury were displayed over [[York city walls#Micklegate Bar|Micklegate Bar]], the south-western gate through the [[York city walls]], the Duke wearing a paper crown and a sign saying &quot;Let York overlook the town of York&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2015), p.257&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Richard of York did not end the wars, or the [[House of York]]'s claim to the throne. The northern Lancastrian army which had been victorious at Wakefield was reinforced by Scots and borderers eager for plunder, and marched south. They defeated Warwick's army at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] and recaptured the feeble-minded King Henry, who had been abandoned on the battlefield for the third time, but were refused entry to London&lt;ref&gt;Charles Ross, ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and failed to occupy the city. Warwick and Edward of March reoccupied London, and within a few weeks, Edward of March was proclaimed King Edward IV.

At the first Battle of St Albans, York had been content with the death of his rivals for power. At Wakefield and in every battle in the Wars of the Roses thereafter, the victors would eliminate not only any opposing leaders but also their family members and supporters, making the struggle more bitter and revenge driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hicks| first=Michael| title=The Wars of the Roses| publisher=Yale University Press| year=2012| page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monument erected on the spot where the Duke of York is supposed to have perished is positioned slightly south of the more likely spot where an older monument once stood, but which was destroyed during the [[English Civil War]]. A cross in memory of York's son, Rutland, was erected at the Park Street end of Kirkgate in Wakefield.&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2015), p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist Rachel Askew suggests that the memorial cross to the Duke of York may be fictional as the late 16th and early 17th century antiquarian John Camden did not mention it in his description of the location.&lt;ref&gt;Askew (2016), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and folklore==
Many people are familiar with [[William Shakespeare]]'s melodramatic version of events in ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', notably the murder of Edmund of Rutland, although Edmund is depicted as a small child, and following his unnecessary slaughter by Clifford, Margaret torments his father, York, before murdering him also. In fact, Rutland, at seventeen, was more than old enough to be an active participant in the fighting. Margaret was almost certainly still in Scotland at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.susanhigginbotham.com/blog/posts/the-death-of-edmund-earl-of-rutland/ | title=The Death of Edmund, Earl of Rutland | date=17 February 2010 | first=Susan | last=Higginbotham | authorlink=Susan Higginbotham | accessdate=28 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229112205/http://www.susanhigginbotham.com/blog/posts/the-death-of-edmund-earl-of-rutland/ | archive-date=29 December 2017 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle is said by some to be the source for the mnemonic for remembering the traditional colours of the [[rainbow]], [[ROYGBIV|Richard of York Gave Battle in Vain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Surdhar2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Surdhar|first=Christina|title=Bloody British History: York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxATDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT56|accessdate=29 December 2017|date=2 September 2013|publisher=History Press|isbn=9780750951593|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the mocking [[nursery rhyme]], &quot;[[The Grand Old Duke of York]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;J. Swinnerton, ''The History of Britain Companion'' (Robson, 2005), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; although this much more likely refers to the eighteenth-century duke, son of [[George III]].&lt;ref name=Opie1997&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 442–443.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Dicky's Meadow&quot;, a well-known Northern expression, is commonly believed to refer to Sandals Meadow, where the battle of Wakefield took place and where Richard met his end. The common view held that Richard was ill-advised to fight here. The expression is usually used to warn against risky action, as in &quot;If you do that you'll end up in Dicky's Meadow.&quot; However, the first known usage of that phrase did not appear until the 1860s, around 400 years after the battle took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://wordhistories.net/2016/06/22/origin-of-dickys-meadow/ | title=Origin of the Lancashire phrase ‘in Dicky’s meadow’ | first=Pascal | last=Tréguer |date=22 June 2016 | publisher=Word Histories | accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Wars of the Roses}}

The '''Battle of Towton''' was fought on 29 March 1461 during the English [[Wars of the Roses]], near the village of [[Towton]] in [[Yorkshire]]. It was &quot;probably the largest and bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil&quot;.{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|p=7}} An estimated 50,000&amp;nbsp;soldiers fought for hours amidst a snowstorm on that day, which was [[Palm Sunday]]. It brought about a change of monarchs in [[Kingdom of England|England]], with [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] displacing [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], establishing the [[House of York]] on the English throne and driving the incumbent [[House of Lancaster]] and its key supporters out of the country.

The incumbent King of England, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], on the throne since 1422, was a weak, ineffectual, and mentally unsound ruler, which encouraged the nobles to scheme for control over him. The situation deteriorated in the 1450s into a civil war between the supporters of his queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], and those of his cousin [[Richard, Duke of York]]. In 1460, the [[Parliament of England|English parliament]] passed [[Act of Accord|an act]] to let York succeed Henry as king. The queen refused to accept the dispossession of [[Edward of Westminster|her own son]]'s right to the throne and succeeded in raising a large army of supporters, who then promptly [[Battle of Wakefield|defeated and killed York in battle]]. The late duke's supporters considered the Lancastrians to have reneged on the parliamentary act of succession – a legal agreement – and York's son and heir, [[Edward IV of England|Edward]], found enough backing to denounce Henry and declare himself king. The Battle of Towton was to affirm the victor's right to rule over England through force of arms.

On reaching the battlefield, the Yorkists found themselves heavily outnumbered. Part of their force under the [[John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] had yet to arrive. The Yorkist leader [[William Neville, Earl of Kent|Lord Fauconberg]] turned the tables by ordering his archers to take advantage of the strong wind to outrange their enemies. The one-sided missile exchange, with Lancastrian arrows falling short of the Yorkist ranks, provoked the Lancastrians into abandoning their defensive positions. The ensuing [[hand-to-hand combat]] lasted hours, exhausting the combatants. The arrival of Norfolk's men reinvigorated the Yorkists and, encouraged by [[Edward IV of England|Edward]], they routed their foes. Many Lancastrians were killed while fleeing; some trampled each other and others drowned in the rivers, which are said to have run red with blood for several days. Several who were taken as prisoners were executed.

The power of the House of Lancaster was severely reduced after this battle. Henry fled the country, and many of his most powerful followers were dead or in exile after the engagement, leaving a new king, Edward IV, to rule England. Later generations remembered the battle as depicted in [[William Shakespeare]]'s dramatic adaptation of Henry's life – ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', Act&amp;nbsp;2, Scene&amp;nbsp;5. In 1929, the Towton Cross was erected on the battlefield to commemorate the event. Various archaeological remains and mass graves related to the battle were found in the area centuries after the engagement.

In 1461, England was in the sixth year of the Wars of the Roses, a series of civil wars between the houses of [[House of York|York]] and [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] over the English throne. The Lancastrians backed the reigning King of England, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], an indecisive man who had bouts of madness.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=289}} The leader of the Yorkists was initially [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], who resented the dominance of a small number of aristocrats favoured by the king, principally his close relatives, the [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort family]]. Fuelled by rivalries between influential supporters of both factions, York's attempts to displace Henry's favourites from power led to war.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=289}}{{Sfn|Ross|1997|pp=11–18}} After capturing Henry at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] in 1460, the duke, who was of royal blood, issued his claim to the throne. Even York's closest supporters among the nobility were reluctant to usurp the dynasty; the nobles passed by a majority vote the [[Act of Accord]], which ruled that the duke and his heirs would succeed the throne upon Henry's death.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=147}}{{Sfn|Hicks|2002|p=211}}&lt;!-- Wolffe 332 effectively labels them conservative.  --&gt;

The Queen of England, [[Margaret of Anjou]], refused to accept an arrangement that deprived her son—[[Edward of Westminster]]—of his birthright. She had fled to Scotland after the Yorkist victory at Northampton; there she began raising an army, promising her followers the freedom to plunder on the march south through England. Her Lancastrian supporters also mustered in the north of England, preparing for her arrival. York marched with his army to meet this threat but he was lured into a trap at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] and killed. The duke and his second son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]] were decapitated by the Lancastrians and their heads were impaled on spikes atop the [[York city walls#Micklegate Bar|Micklegate Bar]], a gatehouse of the city of York.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2001|pp=324–327}} The leadership of the House of York passed onto the duke's heir, [[Edward IV of England|Edward]].{{Sfn|Ross|1997|pp=7, 33}}

[[File:Movement to Towton.svg|thumb|upright|left|alt=The Yorkist army moved north towards Towton, engaging in the Battle of Ferrybridge on 28 March and reaching Sherburn-in-Elmet on the same day. The Lancastrians moved southwards through Tadcaster. Both arrived at Towton on 29 March.|The armies of York (white) and Lancaster (red) move towards Towton.]]
The victors of Wakefield were joined by Margaret's army and they marched south, plundering settlements in their wake. They liberated Henry after defeating the Yorkist army of [[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] and continued pillaging on their way to London. The city of London refused to open its gates to Henry and Margaret for fear of being looted. The Lancastrian army was short of supplies and had no adequate means to replenish them. When Margaret learned that Richard of York's eldest son Edward, Earl of March and his army had won the [[Battle of Mortimer's Cross]] in Herefordshire and were marching towards London, she withdrew the Lancastrians to York.{{Sfn|Harriss|2005|p=538}}{{Sfn|Ross|1997|pp=29–32}} Warwick and the remnants of his army marched from St Albans to join Edward's men and the Yorkists were welcomed into London. Having lost custody of Henry, the Yorkists needed a justification to continue the rebellion against the king and his Lancastrian followers. On 4 March, Warwick proclaimed the young Yorkist leader as King Edward IV. The proclamation gained greater acceptance than Richard of York's earlier claim, as several nobles opposed to letting Edward's father ascend the throne viewed the Lancastrian actions as a betrayal of the legally established Accord.{{Sfn|Hicks|2002|pp=216–217}}{{Sfn|Wolffe|2001|pp=330–331}}

The country now had two kings—a situation that could not be allowed to persist, especially if Edward were to be formally crowned.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2001|pp=330–331}} Edward offered amnesty to any Lancastrian supporter who renounced Henry. The move was intended to win over the commoners; his offer did not extend to wealthy Lancastrians (mostly the nobles).{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=35}} The young king summoned and ordered his followers to march towards York to take back his family's city and to formally depose Henry through force of arms.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2001|pp=332–333}} The Yorkist army moved along three routes. Warwick's uncle, [[William Neville, 1st Earl of Kent|Lord Fauconberg]], led a group to clear the way to York for the main body, which was led by Edward. [[John de Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|The Duke of Norfolk]] was sent east to raise forces and rejoin Edward before the battle. Warwick's group moved to the west of the main body, through the Midlands, gathering men as they went. On 28 March, the leading elements of the Yorkist army came upon the remains of the crossing in [[Ferrybridge]] that spanned the [[River Aire]]. They were rebuilding the bridge when they [[Battle of Ferrybridge|were attacked and routed]] by a band of about 500 Lancastrians, led by [[John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford|Lord Clifford]].{{Sfn|Hicks|2002|pp=218–219}}

Learning of the encounter, Edward led the main Yorkist army to the bridge and was forced into a gruelling battle; although the Yorkists were superior in numbers, the narrow bridge was a bottleneck, forcing them to confront Clifford's men on equal terms. Edward sent Fauconberg and his horsemen to ford the river at Castleford, which should have been guarded by Henry Earl of Northumberland but he arrived late, by which time the Yorkists had crossed the ford and were heading to attack the Lancastrians at Ferrybridge from the flank. The Lancastrians retreated but were chased to Dinting Dale where they were all killed; Clifford was slain by an arrow to his throat. Having cleared the vicinity of enemy forces, the Yorkists repaired the bridge and pressed onwards to camp overnight at [[Sherburn-in-Elmet]]. The Lancastrian army marched to Tadcaster, about {{convert|2|mi}} north of Towton and made camp.{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|pp=32–39}} As dawn broke, the two rival armies struck camp under dark skies and strong winds.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=37}}{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|p=47}} Although it was [[Palm Sunday]], a day of holy significance to Christians, the forces prepared for battle and a few documents named the engagement the Battle of ''Palme Sonday Felde'' but the name did not gain wide acceptance.{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|pp=38, 40}} Popular opinion favoured naming the battle after the village of Towton because of its proximity and it being the most prominent in the area.{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|p=44}}

== Force compositions ==
The armies gathered at Towton were among the largest at the time.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=1}} Contemporary sources (like ''[[Gregory's Chronicle]]'') claimed that the soldiers on each side numbered in the hundreds of thousands.{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|p=25}} These figures are thought to be exaggerated, and modern historians believe that a combined figure of around 50,000–65,000 is more likely, approximately one to two percent of the English population at the time.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=36}}{{Sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=331}}{{sfn|Sadler|2011|p=78}} An analysis of 50 skeletons found in mass graves between 1996 and 2003 showed most were 24 to 30 years old, and many were veterans of previous engagements.{{Sfn|Scott|2010|p=24}}

Henry's physical and mental frailty was a major weakness for the Lancastrian cause, and he remained in York with Margaret.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=331}} In contrast, the 18-year-old Edward was a tall and imposing sight in armour, who led from the front; his preference for bold offensive tactics determined the Yorkist plan of action for this engagement. His presence and example was crucial to ensuring the Yorkists held together through the long and exhausting struggle.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=37}}

Approximately three-quarters of [[Peerage of England|English peers]] fought in the battle;{{Sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=331}} eight were with the Yorkist army, whereas the Lancastrians had at least nineteen.{{Sfn|Goodman|1990|p=51}}

Of the other Yorkist leaders, Warwick was absent from the battle, having suffered a leg wound at [[Battle of Ferrybridge|Ferrybridge]].{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=46}} Norfolk was too old to participate and his contingent was commanded by [[Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy|Walter Blount]] and Robert Horne; this may have been an advantage, since he was regarded as an unpredictable ally.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=126,156}} Edward relied heavily on Warwick's uncle, Lord Fauconberg, a veteran of the [[Hundred Years' War|Anglo-French wars]], highly regarded by contemporaries for his military skills.{{Sfn|Goodman|1990|p=165}} He demonstrated this in a wide range of roles, having captained the Calais garrison,{{Sfn|Goodman|1990|p=165}} led naval piracy expeditions in the [[English Channel|Channel]],{{Sfn|Hicks|2002|pp=147, 240}} and commanded the Yorkist vanguard at Northampton.{{Sfn|Hicks|2002|p=179}}

The senior Lancastrian general was [[Henry Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]], an experienced leader credited with victories at Wakefield and St Albans, although others suggest they were due to Sir [[Andrew Trollope]]. {{Sfn|Gravett|2003|pp=20–21}} Trollope was an extremely experienced and astute commander, who served under Warwick in Calais, before defecting to the Lancastrians at [[Battle of Ludford Bridge|Ludford Bridge]] in 1459.{{Sfn|Goodman|1990|p=166}} Other notable Lancastrian leaders included [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter|Henry Holland, Duke of Exeter]],{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=17}} and northern magnates the [[Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]],{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|p=20}} [[Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros|Lord de Ros]] and [[Ralph Dacre, 1st Baron Dacre of Gilsland|Lord Dacre]].

== Deployment ==

Very few historical sources give detailed accounts of the battle and they do not describe the exact deployments of the armies. The paucity of such primary sources led early historians to adopt Hall's chronicle as their main resource for the engagement, despite its authorship 70&amp;nbsp;years after the event and questions over the origin of his information. The [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] chronicler [[Jean de Waurin]] (c. 1398 – c. 1474) was a more contemporary source, but his chronicle was made available to the public only from 1891, and several mistakes in it discouraged historians at that time from using it. Later reconstructions of the battle were based on Hall's version, supplemented by minor details from other sources.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=2–5}}{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|pp=50–51}}

The battle took place on a [[plateau]] between the villages of [[Saxton, North Yorkshire|Saxton]] (to the south) and [[Towton]] (to the north). The region was agricultural land, with plenty of wide open areas and small roads on which to manoeuvre the armies.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}} Two roads ran through the area: the Old London Road, which connected Towton to the English capital, and a direct road between Saxton and Towton. The steeply banked [[Cock Beck]] flowed in an S-shaped course around the plateau from the north to west. The plateau was bisected by the Towton Dale, which ran from the west and extended into the North Acres in the east. Woodlands were scattered along the beck; Renshaw Woods lined the river on the north-western side of the plateau, and south of Towton Dale, Castle Hill Wood grew on the west side of the plateau at a bend in the beck. The area to the north-east of this forest would be known as Bloody Meadow after the battle.{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|pp=44–46}}

According to Gravett and fellow military enthusiast Trevor James Halsall, Somerset's decision to engage the Yorkist army on this plateau was sound. Defending the ground just before Towton would block any enemy advance towards the city of York, whether they moved along the London–Towton road or an old Roman road to the west. The Lancastrians deployed on the north side of the dale, using the valley as a &quot;protective ditch&quot;;{{Sfn|Halsall|2000|p=41}}{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|p=46}} the disadvantage of this position was that they could not see beyond the southern ridge of the dale.{{Sfn|Halsall|2000|p=42}} The Lancastrian flanks were protected by marshes; their right was further secured by the steep banks of the Cock Beck. The width of their deployment area did not allow for a longer front line, depriving the Lancastrians of the opportunity to use their numerical superiority.{{Sfn|Halsall|2000|p=41}} Waurin's account gave rise to the suggestion that Somerset ordered a force of mounted spearmen to conceal itself in Castle Hill Wood, ready to charge into the Yorkist left flank at an opportune time in battle.{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|p=59}}

The Yorkists appeared as the Lancastrians finished deployment. Line after line of soldiers crested the southern ridge of the dale and formed up in ranks opposite their enemies as snow began to fall. Edward's army was outnumbered and Norfolk's troops had yet to arrive to join them.{{sfn|Gravett|2003|pp=49–50}} The Yorkist vanguard was commanded by Lord Fauconberg. Hall names [[John Wenlock, Baron Wenlock|John Wenlock]] and [[John Dynham, Baron Dynham|John Dinham]] and others as commanders of the Yorkist rearguard.{{sfn|Gravett|2003|pp=50–51}}{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}} Sources variously mention the [[Henry Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], Trollope, the [[Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] and the [[Henry Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter|Duke of Exeter]] as the commanders of the Lancastrian host, but show little agreement as to which portion of the host each of them was assigned.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=3, 4–5}}

== Fighting ==
[[File:Fauconbridge's tactics at Towton.jpg|thumb|300px|Yorkist leader [[William Neville, Earl of Kent|William Neville]] (on horse) and his archers took advantage of the wind to inflict early damage on the Lancastrians – 19th century drawing]]

As Somerset was content to stand and let his foes come to him, the opening move of the battle was made by the Yorkists.{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|pp=52–53}} Noticing the direction and strength of the wind, Fauconberg ordered all Yorkist archers to step forward and unleash a volley of their arrows from what would be the standard maximum range of their longbows. With the wind behind them, the Yorkist missiles travelled farther than usual, plunging deep into the masses of soldiers on the hill slope.

The response from the Lancastrian [[archers]] was ineffective as the heavy wind blew snow in their faces. They found it difficult to judge the range and pick out their targets and their arrows fell short of the Yorkist ranks; Fauconberg had ordered his men to retreat after loosing one volley, thus avoiding any casualties. Unable to observe their results, the Lancastrians loosed their arrows until most had been used, leaving a thick, prickly carpet in the ground in front of the Yorkists.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=37}}{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|pp=53–56}}

[[File:Bodkin1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A wooden shaft is tipped with a narrow metal piece sharpened to a point.|Bodkin arrows were among the missiles that killed many in the battle.]]

After the Lancastrians had ceased loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers to step forward again to shoot. When they had exhausted their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off the ground in front of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued shooting. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=37}}{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|pp=56–57}}

As the Yorkists reformed their ranks to receive the Lancastrian charge, their left flank came under attack by the horsemen from Castle Hill Wood mentioned by Waurin. The Yorkist left wing fell into disarray and several men started to flee. Edward had to take command of the left wing to save the situation. By engaging in the fight and encouraging his followers, his example inspired many to stand their ground. The armies clashed and archers shot into the mass of men at short range. The Lancastrians continuously threw fresher men into the fray and gradually the numerically inferior Yorkist army was forced to give ground and retreat up the southern ridge. Gravett thought that the Lancastrian left had less momentum than the rest of its formation, skewing the line of battle such that its western end tilted towards Saxton.{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|pp=60–61, 65}}{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=6}}

The fighting continued for three hours, according to research by [[English Heritage]], a government body in charge of conservation of historic sites.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=37}}{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=6}} It was indecisive until the arrival of Norfolk's men. Marching up the Old London Road, Norfolk's contingent was hidden from view until they crested the ridge and attacked the Lancastrian left flank.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=6}}{{Sfn|Harriss|2005|p=644}} The Lancastrians continued to give fight but the advantage had shifted to the Yorkists. By the end of the day, the Lancastrian line had broken up, as small groups of men began fleeing for their lives.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=37}} [[Polydore Vergil]], chronicler for [[Henry VII of England]], claimed that combat lasted for a total of 10&amp;nbsp;hours.{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|p=68}}

===Relief===
{{Main|Famine relief}}
There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html |title=UN aid debate: Give cash, not food? |date=4 June 2008 |journal=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations' [[World Food Program]] (WFP), the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a &quot;revolution&quot; in food aid.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;&lt;ref name=wfp&gt;http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899 |date=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;

However, for people in a [[drought]] living a long way from and with limited access to [[Marketplace|markets]], delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt; [[Fred Cuny]] stated that &quot;the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported.

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed recipe for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2 |title=Ethiopia: A model of African food aid is now in trouble |date=6 May 2008 |journal=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green Revolution]] was widely viewed as an answer to famine in the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1950 and 1984, hybrid strains of high-yielding crops transformed agriculture around the globe and world grain production increased by 250%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6496585.stm|title=Special Reports&amp;nbsp;– The limits of a Green Revolution?|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=August 2013}} criticize the process, stating that these new high-yielding crops require more chemical [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s, which can harm the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pimentel|first=David|date=September 1996|title=Green revolution agriculture and chemical hazards|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2F0048-9697%2896%2905280-1|journal=[[Science of the Total Environment]]|volume=188|pages=S86–S98|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(96)05280-1|pmid=8966546|bibcode=1996ScTEn.188S..86P|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these high-yielding crops make it technically possible to feed more people, there are indications that regional food production has peaked in many world sectors, due to certain strategies associated with intensive agriculture such as [[groundwater]] [[overdrafting]] and overuse of [[pesticide]]s and other agricultural chemicals.

===Levels of food insecurity===
{{Main|Famine scales}}

In modern times, local and political governments and [[non-governmental organization]]s that deliver famine relief have limited resources with which to address the multiple situations of food insecurity that are occurring simultaneously. Various methods of categorizing the gradations of food security have thus been used in order to most efficiently allocate food relief. One of the earliest were the [[Indian Famine Codes]] devised by the British in the 1880s. The Codes listed three stages of food insecurity: near-scarcity, scarcity and famine, and were highly influential in the creation of subsequent famine warning or measurement systems. The early warning system developed to monitor the region inhabited by the [[Turkana people]] in northern Kenya also has three levels, but links each stage to a pre-planned response to mitigate the crisis and prevent its deterioration

The experiences of famine relief organizations throughout the world over the 1980s and 1990s resulted in at least two major developments: the &quot;livelihoods approach&quot; and the increased use of nutrition indicators to determine the severity of a crisis. Individuals and groups in food stressful situations will attempt to cope by rationing consumption, finding alternative means to supplement income, etc., before taking desperate measures, such as selling off plots of [[agriculture|agricultural]] land. When all means of self-support are exhausted, the affected population begins to migrate in search of food or fall victim to outright mass [[starvation]]. Famine may thus be viewed partially as a social phenomenon, involving [[Market (economics)|markets]], the price of food, and social support structures. A second lesson drawn was the increased use of rapid nutrition assessments, in particular of children, to give a quantitative measure of the famine's severity.

Since 2003, many of the most important organizations in famine relief, such as the [[World Food Programme]] and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]], have adopted a five-level scale measuring intensity and magnitude. The intensity scale uses both livelihoods' measures and measurements of mortality and child malnutrition to categorize a situation as food secure, food insecure, food crisis, famine, severe famine, and extreme famine. The number of deaths determines the magnitude designation, with under 1000 fatalities defining a &quot;minor famine&quot; and a &quot;catastrophic famine&quot; resulting in over 1,000,000 deaths.

==Society and culture==
Famine personified as an [[allegory]] is found in some cultures, e.g. one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in Christian tradition, the [[fear gorta]] of Irish folklore, or the [[Wendigo]] of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tradition.

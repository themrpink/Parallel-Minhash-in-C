The leopard was [[Crossbreeding|crossbred]] with other ''Panthera'' species in zoos. In 1953, a lioness and a male leopard were mated in Hanshin Park in [[Nishinomiya, Japan]]. The first litter from this pair was born in November 1959, consisting of a male and a female. Another litter was born in 1961, in which all the offspring were spotted and bigger than a juvenile leopard. This hybrid came to be known as a [[leopon]]. Unsuccessful attempts were made to mate a leopon with a tigress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kisling |editor1-first=V.N. |title=Zoo and Aquarium History : Ancient Animal Collections to Zoological Gardens |year=2001|publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida (USA) |isbn=978-0-8493-2100-9 |page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leopard is a solitary and [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] animal. Adults associate only in the mating season. Females continue to interact with their offspring even after weaning, and have been observed sharing kills with their offspring when they can not obtain any prey. They produce a number of vocalizations, including growls, snarls, meows and purrs. The [[roaring]] sequence in leopards consists mainly of grunts and is also called &quot;sawing&quot;, having been described as resembling the sound of sawing wood. Cubs are known to call their mother with a ''urr-urr'' sound.&lt;ref name=estes/&gt;

The whitish spots on the back of its ears are thought to play a role in communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leyhausen |first1=P. |year=1979 |title=Cat behavior: the predatory and social behavior of domestic and wild cats |location=Berlin |publisher=Garland Publishing, Incorporated |page=281 |chapter= |isbn=9780824070175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leopard is a [[carnivore]] that prefers medium-sized prey with a body mass ranging from {{convert|10|–|40|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Prey species in this weight range tend to occur in dense habitat and to form small herds. Species that prefer open areas and developed significant anti-predator strategies are less preferred.

Prey as heavy as a {{convert|550|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[giraffe]] is hunted, especially in areas that lack larger carnivores such as lions or tigers since they do not need to drag prey up trees to retain it. In areas such as [[Sri Lanka]], reserves in [[Central Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] and most of the montane and [[tropical rainforest]]s of Africa, the leopard is the remaining top terrestrial predator present and often take varied prey of various sizes, including at times large ungulates weighing hundreds of kilograms, although they also takes smaller prey such as monkeys where ungulates are scarce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheepers&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheepers |first1=J.

The leopard stalks its prey and tries to approach as close as possible, typically within {{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to the target, and finally pounces on it and kills it by suffocation.

== Threats ==
The leopard is primarily threatened by [[habitat fragmentation]] and conversion of forest to agriculturally used land, which lead to a declining natural prey base, [[human–wildlife conflict]] with livestock herders and high leopard mortality rates. It is also threatened by [[trophy hunting]] and [[poaching]].&lt;ref name=IUCN /&gt;
Between 2002 and 2012, at least four leopards were estimated to have been poached per week in India for the [[illegal wildlife trade]] of its skins and bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author1=Raza, R.H. |name-list-style=amp |author2=Chauhan, D.S. |author3=Pasha, M.K.S. |author4=Sinha, S. |date=2012 |title=Illuminating the blind spot: A study on illegal trade in Leopard parts in India (2001–2010) |publisher=TRAFFIC India, WWF India |location=New Delhi |url=https://www.traffic.org/site/assets/files/4130/illuminating_the_blind_spot.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Surveys in the Central African Republic's [[Chinko]] area revealed that the leopard population decreased from 97 individuals in 2012 to 50 individuals in 2017. In this period, [[transhumant]] [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]]s from the border area with Sudan moved in the area with their livestock. Rangers confiscated large amounts of [[poison]] in the camps of livestock herders who were accompanied by armed merchants. They engaged in poaching large herbivores, sale of [[bushmeat]] and trading leopard skins in [[Am Dafok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Äbischer, T. |author2=Ibrahim, T. |author3=Hickisch, R. |author4=Furrer, R.

==Leopards and humans==
[[File:Benin, acquamanile a forma di leopardo, XVIII sec.JPG|thumb|right|A Benin water vessel shaped like a leopard]]
Leopards have been known to humans throughout history, and have featured in the art, mythology, and folklore of many countries where they have historically occurred. In [[Greek mythology]], the leopard was a symbol of the god [[Dionysus]]; who was depicted wearing leopard skin and using leopards as means of transportation. In one myth, the god was captured by pirates but two leopards appear and rescue him. The [[Ancient Roman]]s kept leopards in captivity to be slaughtered in hunts as well as be used in executions of criminals.&lt;ref name=reaktion&gt;{{cite book|author=Morris, Desmond|year=2014|title=Leopard|publisher=Reaktion Books|pages=23–24, 62, 99|isbn=9781780233185}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Benin Empire]], the leopard was commonly represented on engravings and sculptures and was used to symbolize the power of the king or ''[[Oba (ruler)|oba]]'', since the leopard was considered the king of the forest. Leopards were also kept and paraded as mascots, totems and sacrifices to deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/PDF/british_museum_benin_art.pdf|title=Benin: an African kingdom|accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Shropshire.svg|thumb|right|Three leopards (loggerheads) on the flag of [[Shropshire]], England]]
The lion passant guardant or leopard is a frequently used [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[Leopard (heraldry)|heraldry]], most commonly appearing in groups of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mark of the Beast: The Medieval Bestiary in Art, Life, and Literature|last=Strickland|first=Debra Higgs|author2=Debra Hassig |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8153-2952-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heraldic leopard lacks spots and sports a mane, making it visually almost identical to the [[Lion (heraldry)|heraldic lion]], and the two are often used interchangeably. These traditional lions passant guardant appear in the [[coat of arms of Dalmatia]] and the [[coat of arms of England]] and many of its former colonies; more modern naturalistic (leopard-like) depictions appear on the coat of arms of several African nations including [[Coat of arms of Benin|Benin]], [[Coat of arms of Malawi|Malawi]], [[Coat of arms of Somalia|Somalia]], the [[Coat of arms of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Coat of arms of Gabon|Gabon]], the last of which uses a black panther.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The International Flag Book in Color|url=https://archive.org/details/internationalfla00pede|url-access=registration|last=Pedersen|first=Christian Fagd|publisher=Morrow|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coat of the leopard has been popular decorative clothing and a symbol of power, wealth and the exotic, being worn by African chiefs, European queens, Hollywood film stars and [[burlesque]] dancers.&lt;ref name=reaktion/&gt;

Leopard captivity in historical times has also been recorded — several leopards were kept in a menagerie established by [[John of England|King John]] at the [[Tower of London]] in the 13th century; around 1235, three of these animals were given to [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Owen | first = James | title = Medieval Lion Skulls Reveal Secrets of Tower of London 'Zoo' | work = National Geographic Magazine | publisher = National Geographic | date = November 3, 2005 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/11/1103_051103_tower_lions.html | accessdate = 2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
In protected areas of several countries, wildlife touring programs and safari ventures offer sightings of leopards in their natural habitat. While luxury establishments may boast the fact that wild animals can be seen at close range on a daily basis, the leopard's camouflage and propensity to hide and stalk prey typically make leopard sightings rare.&lt;ref name=wines&gt;{{cite news|author=Wines, M. |year=2004 |title=In South Africa, It's All in the Game |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/24/travel/24timbavati.html?_r=0 |accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sri Lanka's [[Yala National Park]], leopards have been ranked by visitors to be among the least visible of all animals in the park, despite their high concentration in the reserve.&lt;ref name=fao&gt;Weerasinghe, U.M.I.R.K., Kariyawasm, D. and M. De Zoysa (2003). [http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/ARTICLE/WFC/XII/0116-A1.HTM Ruhuna (Yala) National Park in Sri Lanka: Visitors, Visitation, and Eco-Tourism]. Contribution to the XII World Forestry Congress, Quebec. FAO.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, safaris are offered in numerous nature reserves such as in [[Sabi Sand Game Reserve]]. In Sri Lanka, wildlife tours are available in Yala and [[Wilpattu National Park]]s. In India, safaris are offered in [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]] national parks as well as in the [[Pali district]] of western [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/t-magazine/life-among-the-leopards-jawai-india.html |title=Life Among the Leopards |first=H. |last=Kunzru |date=2015 |work=NYTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Man-eating===
{{Main|Leopard attack}}
[[File:PanarManeater.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Leopard attack#Notable man-eaters|Panar Leopard]], shot by [[Jim Corbett]] in 1910 after allegedly killing more than 400 people]]
Most leopards avoid people, but humans may occasionally be targeted as prey. Most healthy leopards prefer wild prey to humans, but injured, sickly, or struggling cats or those with a shortage of regular prey may resort to hunting humans and become habituated to it. Although usually slightly smaller than a human, an adult leopard is much more powerful and easily capable of killing one. Two extreme cases occurred in India: the first leopard, &quot;the [[Leopard of Rudraprayag]]&quot;, killed more than 125 people; the second, &quot;the [[Panar Leopard]]&quot;, was believed to have killed more than 400. Both were killed by the renowned hunter and conservationist [[Jim Corbett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Death in the Long Grass|last=Capstick|first=Peter Hathaway|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-312-18613-5|url=https://archive.org/details/deathinlonggrass00caps}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-eating leopards are considered bold and difficult to track and may enter human settlements for prey, more so than lions and tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first= K. |title=Nine Man-Eaters and one Rogue |publisher= Allen &amp; Unwin |year=1954 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and big game hunter, [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]], had first-hand experience with many man-eating leopards, and described them as far more threatening than tigers:

{{quote|Although examples of such animals are comparatively rare, when they do occur they depict the panther [leopard] as an engine of destruction quite equal to his far larger cousin, the tiger. Because of his smaller size he can conceal himself in places impossible to a tiger, his need for water is far less, and in veritable demoniac cunning and daring, coupled with the uncanny sense of self-preservation and stealthy disappearance when danger threatens, he has no equal.|Kenneth Anderson, ''Nine Man-Eaters and One Rogue'', Chapter II &quot;The Spotted Devil of Gummalapur&quot;}}
{{quote|There is something very terrifying in the angry grunt of a charging leopard, and I have seen a line of elephants that were staunch to a tiger, turn and stampede from a charging leopard.|Jim Corbett, ''The Temple Tiger and More Man-Eaters of Kumaon'', chapter &quot;The Panar Man-Eater&quot;}}

[[File:Vandal Kingdom Hilderic Denarius.jpg|thumb|A coin struck in Hilderic's name (Hildirix) and bearing his effigy.]]
'''Hilderic''' (460s – 533) was the penultimate king of the [[Vandals]] and [[Alans]] in [[North Africa during the Classical Period|North Africa in Late Antiquity]] (523–530). Although dead by the time the Vandal kingdom was [[Vandalic War|overthrown in 534]], he nevertheless played a key role in that event.

Hilderic was the grandson of king [[Genseric]], founder of the Vandal kingdom in Africa. His father was Genseric's son [[Huneric]], and his mother was [[Eudocia (daughter of Valentinian III)|Eudocia]], the daughter of the [[Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Valentinian III]] and [[Licinia Eudoxia]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart I. Oost, ''Galla Placidia Augusta: A biographical essay'' (Chicago: University Press, 1968), pp. 306f&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Vandals were [[Arianism|Arians]] and had persecuted [[Catholicity|Catholics]], but Hilderic favored Catholicism as the religion of his mother, making his accession to the throne controversial.{{cn|date=September 2011}} Soon after becoming king, Hilderic had his predecessor's widow, [[Amalafrida]], imprisoned; he escaped war with her brother, the Gothic king [[Theoderic the Great]], only by virtue of the latter's death in 526.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', translated by Thomas J. Dunlap (Berkeley: University of California, 1988), p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

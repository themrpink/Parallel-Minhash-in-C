'''The Buggles''' were an English [[New wave music|new wave]] band formed in London in 1977 by singer and bassist [[Trevor Horn]] and keyboardist [[Geoffrey Downes]]. They are best known for their 1979 debut single &quot;[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]&quot;, which topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] and reached number one in 15 other countries.

The duo released their first album, ''[[The Age of Plastic]]'', in January 1980 with &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; as its lead single. Soon after the album's release, Horn and Downes joined the [[progressive rock]] band [[Yes (band)|Yes]], recording and releasing ''[[Drama (Yes album)|Drama]]'' in the process. Following a tour to promote the album, Yes disbanded in 1981. That same year, on 1 August, the music video for &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; became the first ever shown on [[MTV]] in the US. The following year, the Buggles released a second album, ''[[Adventures in Modern Recording]]''. Its lack of commercial success led to the breakup of the group. Since 1998, Horn and Downes have occasionally performed the Buggles' songs. 

In October 2011, the Buggles reunited to play at the [[British Music Experience]] at the [[The O2|O2 Arena]] in London. At the [[Prog_(magazine)#2016_winners|2016 Progressive Music Awards]], the Buggles won an &quot;Outer Limit Award&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sexton, Paul (30 August 2016).

==History==
===1977–1979: Formation===
[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|thumb|left|Initially the Bugs, the name of the Buggles was meant as a pun on [[the Beatles]], pictured here in 1964.]]
Downes claimed the group's name derived as a pun on the rock band [[the Beatles]], saying: &quot;It was originally called the Bugs ... studio insects—imaginary creatures who lived in recording studios creating havoc. Then somebody said as a joke that the Bugs would never be as big as the Beatles. So we changed it to the Buggles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Chris (2008). p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Horn later spoke of its name: &quot;I know the name's awful, but at the time it was the era of the great punk thing. I'd got fed up of producing people who were generally idiots but called themselves all sorts of clever names like the Unwanted, the Unwashed, the Unheard ... when it came to choosing our name I thought I'd pick the most disgusting name possible. In retrospect I have frequently regretted calling myself Buggles, but in those days I never really thought much about packaging or selling myself, all that really concerned me was the record.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Fiona |last=Russell Powell |authorlink=Fiona Russell Powell |title=The Most Wanted Man in Pop |journal=[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]] |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=London, England |pages=52–54 |issue=27 |date=July 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horn began his career producing jingles and [[punk rock]] groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trevor Horn bio&quot;&gt;Whitehouse, K.M. [http://www.theartofnoiseonline.com/Trevor-Horn.php Trevor Horn, C.B.E.]. The Art of Noise Online. Accessed on 23 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Downes was a keyboardist in She's French and graduated from [[Leeds College of Music]] in 1975, after which he moved to London for keyboard work. The two first met in 1976 at auditions for [[Tina Charles (singer)|Tina Charles]]' backing band&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoff Downes Biography&quot;/&gt; and worked with her producer, [[Biddu]], whose backing tracks had an influence on their early work as the Buggles.&lt;ref name=&quot;warner_155&quot;&gt;Warner, Timothy (2003). p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Horn met musician [[Bruce Woolley]] while playing the bass guitar in the house band at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sound on Sound&quot;&gt;Buskin, Richard (December 2011). [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec11/articles/classic-tracks-1211.htm The Buggles 'Video Killed The Radio Star']. [[Sound on Sound]]. Accessed on 23 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Both expressed an interest in [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]], leading them to read ''[[Crash (J. G. Ballard novel)|Crash]]'' by [[J. G. Ballard]]. Said Horn, &quot;We had this idea that at some future point there'd be a record label that didn't really have any artists—just a computer in the basement and some mad [[Vincent Price]]-like figure making the records ... One of the groups this computer would make would be the Buggles, which was obviously a corruption of the Beatles, who would just be this inconsequential bunch of people with a hit song that the computer had written ... and would never be seen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview: Trevor Horn&quot;&gt;Price, Simon (2 February 2012). [http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/interview-trevor-horn.html Interview: Trevor Horn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221305/http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/interview-trevor-horn.html |date=4 October 2013 }}.

In 1977, Horn, Downes and Woolley got together and began recording a selection of demos in a small room above a stonemason shop in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], southwest London, including &quot;[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]&quot;, &quot;[[Clean, Clean]]&quot; and &quot;[[On TV (song)|On TV]]&quot;. Though unsure about what they wished to do with the demos, Downes remembered that &quot;we knew even then ... there was some distant goal that had to be reached&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;BugglesbyGeoffDownes&quot;/&gt; and proceeded to re-record the songs at a [[Multitrack recording|16-track recording]] studio in north London.&lt;ref name = &quot;BugglesbyGeoffDownes&quot;/&gt; Initial searches for the right record label to record and release an album failed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zang Tuum Tumb Bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trevor Horn bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sound on Sound&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;BugglesbyGeoffDownes&quot;&gt;&quot;'The Buggles' by Geoffrey Downes&quot; (liner notes).

===1979–1980: ''The Age of Plastic''===
With the Island recording contract having been secured, the Buggles recorded their debut studio album, ''[[The Age of Plastic]]'', throughout 1979. Initially, the demo of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; featured vocals by [[Tina Charles (singer)|Tina Charles]], who also helped fund the project. Although the song was primarily a Woolley composition, he ended his association with Horn and Downes to form [[Bruce Woolley#The Camera Club|the Camera Club]] before the song's release as a single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tuDZmJa5QY|title=Bruce Woolley &amp; The Camera Club - Video Killed The Radio Star|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=7 June 2011|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making ''The Age of Plastic'' involved several months of tiresome and intense experimentation with studio equipment and techniques, struggling to capture the &quot;magic&quot; of the original demos.&lt;ref name = &quot;BugglesbyGeoffDownes&quot;/&gt; [[Debi Doss]] and Linda Jardim, the female voices on &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, contributed their vocals to other songs on the album.

&quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, the album's lead single, was released first in September 1979 to considerable commercial success, topping the chart in 16 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMR&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media notes |agency= &quot;[[Adventures in Modern Recording]]&quot; |title= From the Art of Plastic to The Age of Noise |others=The Buggles |date=2010 |last=Peel |first=Ian |type=CD insert |publisher=Salvo Records |id= SALVOCD036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its music video, directed by [[Russell Mulcahy]], was the first aired on [[MTV]] in the US on 1 August 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw6xesXLIAA|title=YouTube|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film composer [[Hans Zimmer]] makes a brief appearance in the video. ''The Age of Plastic'' was released in January 1980 and reached No. 27 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Three subsequent singles were released: &quot;[[Living in the Plastic Age|(Living in) The Plastic Age]]&quot;, &quot;[[Clean, Clean]]&quot; and &quot;[[Elstree (song)|Elstree]]&quot;, all of which charted in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17977/buggles/ &quot;The Buggles: UK Chart history&quot;]. Official Charts Company. Retrieved 14 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980–1981: Collaboration with Yes===
In early 1980, Horn and Downes began work on a second Buggles album in London, working in a studio next door to that of the [[progressive rock]] band [[Yes (band)|Yes]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoff Downes Biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geoffdownes.com/sample-page/|title=Biography|work=geoffdownes.com|date=3 July 2005|accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had lost vocalist [[Jon Anderson]] and keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] following failed recording sessions for a potential new album. Horn, in particular, had been a long-standing fan of Yes. The Buggles offered a song to Yes, &quot;We Can Fly from Here&quot;, but at the suggestion of Brian Lane, manager of both bands, Yes' bassist [[Chris Squire]] invited them to actually replace Anderson and Wakeman as members of Yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rock Family Trees - The Prog Rock years|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiajK7BjPgI|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=2 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horn and Downes accepted the offer and joined Squire, [[Steve Howe (guitarist)|Steve Howe]] and [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] to record ''[[Drama (Yes album)|Drama]]''.

The absorption of the Buggles into Yes met with mixed reactions; the band was sometimes booed in the UK despite the band's chart position, but not in the US. Horn admitted that he did not have Anderson's vocal range or style, which many fans missed, but most were still keen to give the new incarnation of Yes a chance. However, some press critics and fans were far less forgiving, especially in the UK. Yes disbanded in December 1980 after the ''Drama'' tour ended.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Chris (2008).{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1981–1982: ''Adventures in Modern Recording''===
In early 1981, following the disbanding of Yes, Downes and Horn reconvened at Sarm East Studios to record the Buggles' second studio album, ''[[Adventures in Modern Recording]]''. However, Downes left the group on the day that the recording was to begin&lt;ref name=&quot;AMR&quot;/&gt; to help form [[Asia (band)|Asia]] with Howe, citing musical differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoff Downes Biography&quot;/&gt; Horn was angry that Island Records renegotiated publishing terms for Downes to join Asia, but never did for Horn since, in his words, he was &quot;washed up, career-wise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMR&quot;/&gt; To fix this problem, Jill Sinclair made a deal with the French label Carrere, whose leader Claude Carrere, whom Horn described as a &quot;very nice man&quot;, helped fund the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMR&quot;/&gt; Horn was now left to complete much of the album with several additional personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMR&quot;/&gt;

Released in November 1981, ''Adventures in Modern Recording'' involved Horn's experimentation with numerous production techniques, especially with the heavy use of sampling with the [[Fairlight CMI]], with instruments from the computer such as the drums on &quot;Inner City&quot; and the big band jazz sounds on &quot;Vermillion Sands&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMR&quot;/&gt; These same sampling techniques would later be used in records that he produced, such as ''[[Slave to the Rhythm (album)|Slave to the Rhythm]]'' by [[Grace Jones]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]]'s ''[[90125]]'', [[Art of Noise]]'s ''[[The Seduction of Claude Debussy]]'' and [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]'s ''[[Welcome to the Pleasuredome]]''. While the album garnered little attention in the United Kingdom, Horn recalled in 2010 that the album was a commercial success in France,&lt;ref name=&quot;AMR&quot;/&gt; and in the United States the album peaked at number 161 on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. By the time of the album's release, when Horn was also producing [[ABC (band)|ABC]]'s album ''[[The Lexicon of Love]]'', he decided to take Sinclair's advice that he always was meant to be a producer rather than a performer or songwriter; thus the performance of &quot;Lenny&quot; on a Dutch TV show, with ABC as the backing band, marked the end of the Buggles. As Horn recalled when he was interviewed after the show:
{{quote|“I’ll never forget it because the guy said to me, ‘well, things are not looking so good for you’, and I said ‘how do you mean?’ And he said ‘well, you know, your first record was a big hit now this record is number eleven, so your career is going downhill’. And I said ‘well you know what? You see these guys, this is a band called ABC and I’m a producer now I don’t really care about this stuff, I’m just doing it to promote the record. And I may be on the skids as an artist but things are looking up in other areas. End of interview. Fuck off.’”&lt;ref name=&quot;AMR&quot;/&gt;}}

===1998–present: Reunion performances===
Being largely a studio creation, the Buggles never toured. There were some ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' playback appearances, and later some performances for promotional purposes in support of the second album, but the first live outing by the original duo came in a low-key appearance on 3 December 1998 at a showcase for new bands on Horn's [[ZTT Records]] label at [[Mean Fiddler]] in northwest London. During this appearance, the Buggles played only &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, backed by singer [[Tessa Niles]] and one of the other groups on the bill, the Marbles.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, Henry (5 December 1998).

On 11 November 2004, the Buggles reunited with Doss, Allen and Woolley at [[Wembley Arena]] to perform &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; and &quot;The Plastic Age&quot; as part of a [[The Prince's Trust]] charity concert celebrating Horn's career as a producer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trevorhorn.com/news/a_concert_for_the_princes_trus.html A concert for The Prince’s Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421185036/http://www.trevorhorn.com/news/a_concert_for_the_princes_trus.html |date=21 April 2010 }}. trevorhorn.com. 16 July 2004.

On 25 October 2011, the Buggles reunited to play at the [[British Music Experience]] at the [[The O2|O2 Arena]]. The gig included the first live performance of &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; and covers of &quot;[[Space Oddity]]&quot; by [[David Bowie]] and &quot;[[Check It Out (will.i.am and Nicki Minaj song)|Check It Out]]&quot; by [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[will.i.am]], which utilised samples from &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;.

==Artistry and reception==
Many of the lyrics [[Trevor Horn]] wrote were inspired by [[sci-fi]] works by writers such as [[J. G. Ballard]]. According to Geoff Downes;
{{quote|&quot;The whole idea of the Buggles was the use of technology in an art form. Hence, we tried to use synthesizers, studio gadgets, etc. to create these fake effects to parallel conventional music. The Polythene Symphonia at the end of Video Killed The Radio Star is one example. Our contributions to the Drama album were an extension of this in many ways.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Geoff Downes Q&amp;A&quot;&gt;[http://www.yesworld.com/2013/05/ask-yes-friday-10th-may-2013-geoff-downes/ Yes Ask YES - Friday 10th May 2013 - Geoff Downes]. yesworld.com. 10 May 2013. Accessed on 23 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Downes claims to have used [[George Shearing]]'s &quot;technique of doubling melody lines in block chords (using the 5th note)... quite extensively on some of the Buggles' recordings&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Keyboard inspirations&quot;&gt;[http://yesworld.com/2013/07/askyes-geoff-downes-keyboard-inspirations/ #askYes Geoff Downes' Keyboard Inspirations]. yesworld.com.

Both of the Buggles' albums have received positive reception from music critics.

Both Asia and Producers have played &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; as part of their live set in tribute to their members' origins in the Buggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh9dFlhpmYM|title=Asia - Video Killed the Radio Star|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=27 July 2009|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtsfKyFyP8w|title=The Producers - Video Killed The Radio Star - High Wycombe Uni - 2012|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=8 March 2012|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Horn produced the album ''[[Reality Killed The Video Star]]'' for British singer [[Robbie Williams]]. The album title pays homage to the trademark Buggles song, and Horn performed the song with Williams (Horn on bass and Williams on vocals) at the [[BBC Electric Proms]] on 20 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/electricproms/2009/artists/robbiewilliams/ Electric Proms - Robbie Williams]. [[BBC]]. 2009. Retrieved October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Following 2010 discussions with Chris Squire, Horn produced the 2011 Yes album ''[[Fly from Here]]'', the bulk of whose forty-seven-minute duration comprises unused or incomplete Buggles material from the early 1980s (particularly &quot;We Can Fly from Here&quot;), reminiscent of the use of the Buggles' ''I am a Camera'' for &quot;Into the Lens&quot; on ''Drama'' during their first stint in 1980. He thus insisted that Downes play keyboards on the album (replacing Oliver Wakeman, son of Rick Wakeman) and Horn himself played and sang backing vocals on the album. The album's group photograph prominently features Horn standing centre, signifying that to all intents he was considered the sixth band member for the recording. ''[[List of Yes concert tours (2000s–10s)#Rite of Spring &amp; Fly From Here Tours|The Fly From Here]]'' tour did not feature Horn.

In February 2017, [[Bruce Woolley]] and his band the Radio Science Orchestra, released a new, [[dark ambient]] version of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; with singer [[Polly Scattergood]] on vocals. The single was released on Gramophone Records, along with a music video featuring musician and producer [[Thomas Dolby]] and [[Wolfgang Wild]] of ''Retronaut'' fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricity-club.co.uk/video-killed-the-radio-star-with-polly-scattergood-and-bruce-wooley/|title=&quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; with Polly Scattergood and Bruce Woolley|website=Electricity-club.co.uk|date=2017-02-24 |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/5597540-Bruce-Woolley-amp-Polly-Scattergood-with-The-Radio-Science-Orchestra|title=Bruce Woolley &amp; Polly Scattergood with the Radio Science Orchestra|website=Discogs.com|date=2017|accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Robot Sings''===
On 8 March 2017, Horn posted an announcement on his official [[Facebook]] page,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/trevorhornofficial/posts/1461241390575229|title=Trevor Horn|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=16 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; linking to an article on theatre website ''Broadway World'' that Horn, Downes and Woolley were working together on a [[musical theatre|musical]] provisionally entitled ''The Robot Sings''. Based on ''[[The Tempest]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]], and taking influence from [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] authors such as [[J. G. Ballard]], [[Brian Aldiss]] and [[Isaac Asimov]], the stage show will tell the story of a boy called Jay trying to save his robot companion. The musical will feature &quot;Video Killed The Radio Star&quot; as well as new compositions by Downes, and the script will be written by Jack Woolley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Video-Killed-the-Radio-Star-Writers-Working-on-THE-ROBOT-SINGS-Musical-20170301#|title=&quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; Writers Working on &quot;The Robot Sings&quot; Musical|website=Broadwayworld.com |date=2017-03-01 |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[real analysis]], he is mostly known for the first rigorous formulation of the integral, the [[Riemann integral]], and his work on [[Fourier series]]. His contributions to [[complex analysis]] include most notably the introduction of [[Riemann surface]]s, breaking new ground in a natural, geometric treatment of complex analysis.
His famous [[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude|1859 paper]] on the [[prime-counting function]], containing the original statement of the [[Riemann hypothesis]], is regarded as one of the most influential papers in [[analytic number theory]].
Through his pioneering [[Riemannian Geometry|contributions to differential geometry]], Riemann laid the foundations of the mathematics of [[general relativity]]. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mccleary |first1=John |title=Geometry from a Differentiable Viewpoint |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sexton |first1=M |url=https://listverse.com/2010/12/07/top-10-greatest-mathematicians/ |title=Top 10 Greatest Mathematicians |website=Listverse |date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Riemann was born on September 17, 1826 in [[Breselenz]], a village near [[Dannenberg (Elbe)|Dannenberg]] in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. His father, Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, was a poor [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor in Breselenz who fought in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. His mother, Charlotte Ebell, died before her children had reached adulthood. Riemann was the second of six children, shy and suffering from numerous nervous breakdowns. Riemann exhibited exceptional mathematical skills, such as calculation abilities, from an early age but suffered from timidity and a fear of speaking in public.

===Education===
During 1840, Riemann went to [[Hanover]] to live with his grandmother and attend [[lyceum]] (middle school years). After the death of his grandmother in 1842, he attended high school at the [[:de:Johanneum Lüneburg|Johanneum Lüneburg]]. In high school, Riemann studied the [[Bible]] intensively, but he was often distracted by mathematics. His teachers were amazed by his adept ability to perform complicated mathematical operations, in which he often outstripped his instructor's knowledge.  In 1846, at the age of 19, he started studying [[philology]] and [[Christian theology]] in order to become a pastor and help with his family's finances.

During the spring of 1846, his father, after gathering enough money, sent Riemann to the [[University of Göttingen]], where he planned to study towards a degree in [[Theology]]. However, once there, he began studying [[mathematics]] under [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (specifically his lectures on the [[method of least squares]]). Gauss recommended that Riemann give up his theological work and enter the mathematical field; after getting his father's approval, Riemann transferred to the [[University of Berlin]] in 1847.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawking2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Hawking|title=God Created The Integers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zdFSOS3f4AC|date=4 October 2005|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-7624-1922-7|pages=814–815}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time of study, [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]], [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], [[Jakob Steiner]], and [[Gotthold Eisenstein]] were teaching. He stayed in Berlin for two years and returned to Göttingen in 1849.

===Academia===
Riemann held his first lectures in 1854, which founded the field of [[Riemannian geometry]] and thereby set the stage for [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]]. In 1857, there was an attempt to promote Riemann to extraordinary professor status at the [[University of Göttingen]]. Although this attempt failed, it did result in Riemann finally being granted a regular salary. In 1859, following the death of Dirichlet (who held [[Gauss]]'s chair at  the University of Göttingen), he was promoted to head the mathematics department at the University of Göttingen. He was also the first to suggest using [[higher dimensions|dimensions higher than merely three or four]]  in order to describe physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;Werke, p. 268, edition of 1876, cited in [http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183493815 Pierpont, Non-Euclidean Geometry, A Retrospect]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 he married Elise Koch and they had a daughter Ida Schilling who was born on 22 December 1862.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geni.com/people/Ida-Schilling/6000000025101232998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant family and death in Italy===
[[File:2009_11_riemann_008.jpg|thumb|Riemann's tombstone in [[Biganzolo]] in [[Piedmont]], Italy.]]Riemann fled Göttingen when the armies of [[Hanover]] and [[Prussia]] clashed there in 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;duSautoy2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=du Sautoy|first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus du Sautoy|title=The Music of the Primes: Searching to Solve the Greatest Mystery in Mathematics|title-link=The Music of the Primes|year=2003|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-621070-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[tuberculosis]] during his third journey to [[Italy]] in Selasca (now a hamlet of [[Verbania]] on [[Lake Maggiore]]) where he was buried in the cemetery in Biganzolo (Verbania).&lt;br&gt;
Riemann was a dedicated Christian, the son of a Protestant minister, and saw his life as a mathematician as another way to serve God. During his life, he held closely to his Christian faith and considered it to be the most important aspect of his life. At the time of his death, he was reciting the Lord’s Prayer with his wife and died before they finished saying the prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://godandmath.com/2012/04/24/christian-mathematicians-riemann/ |title=Christian Mathematician – Riemann |accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in Göttingen his housekeeper discarded some of the papers in his office, including much unpublished work. Riemann refused to publish incomplete work, and some deep insights may have been lost forever.&lt;ref name=&quot;duSautoy2003&quot; /&gt;

Riemann's tombstone in [[Biganzolo]] (Italy) refers to {{bibleref|Romans| 8:28|NIV}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mihai-caragiu-maths.blogspot.co.uk/2009/09/bernhard-riemann.html| title=Riemann's Tomb |accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riemann's published works opened up research areas combining analysis with geometry. These would subsequently become major parts of the theories of [[Riemannian geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]], and [[complex manifold]] theory. The theory of [[Riemann surface]]s was elaborated by [[Felix Klein]] and particularly [[Adolf Hurwitz]]. This area of mathematics is part of the foundation of [[topology]] and is still being applied in novel ways to [[mathematical physics]].

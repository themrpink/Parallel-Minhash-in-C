Due to inadequate production of [[estrogen]], many of those with Turner syndrome develop [[osteoporosis]]. This can decrease height further, as well as exacerbate the curvature of the spine, possibly leading to [[scoliosis]]. It is also associated with an increased risk of [[bone fracture]]s.

=== Kidney ===
About one-third of all women with Turner syndrome have one of three kidney abnormalities:

# A single, horseshoe-shaped kidney on one side of the body
# An abnormal urine-collecting system
# Poor blood flow to the kidneys

Some of these conditions can be corrected surgically. Even with these abnormalities, the kidneys of most women with Turner syndrome function normally. However, as noted above, kidney problems may be associated with [[hypertension]].

=== Thyroid ===
Approximately one-third of all women with Turner syndrome have a thyroid disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsheikh&quot; /&gt; Usually it is [[hypothyroidism]], specifically [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]]. If detected, it can be easily treated with thyroid hormone supplements.

=== Diabetes ===
Women with Turner syndrome are at a moderately increased risk of developing [[type 1 diabetes]] in childhood and a substantially increased risk of developing [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] by adult years. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes can be substantially reduced by maintaining a healthy weight.

=== Cognitive ===
People with Turner syndrome have normal intelligence, and demonstrate relative strengths in verbal skills, but may exhibit weaker nonverbal skills – particularly in arithmetic, select visuospatial skills, and processing speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mazzocco MM | title = The cognitive phenotype of Turner syndrome: Specific learning disabilities | journal = International Congress Series | volume = 1298 | pages = 83–92 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 19750135 | pmc = 2742423 | doi = 10.1016/j.ics.2006.06.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner syndrome does not typically cause [[intellectual disability]] or impair cognition. However, learning difficulties are common among women with Turner syndrome, particularly a specific difficulty in perceiving spatial relationships, such as [[nonverbal learning disorder]]. This may also manifest itself as a difficulty with motor control or with [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/turner-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360782|title=Turner Syndrome|date=November 18, 2017|website=Mayo Clinic|access-date=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is not correctable, in most cases it does not cause difficulty in daily living. Most Turner syndrome patients are employed as adults and lead productive lives.

Also, a rare variety of Turner syndrome, known as &quot;Ring-X Turner syndrome&quot;, has about a 60% association with intellectual disability{{Clarify|reason=use of association is non-standard|date=April 2016}}. This variety accounts for around 2–4% of all Turner syndrome cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berkovitz G, Stamberg J, Plotnick LP, Lanes R | title = Turner syndrome patients with a ring X chromosome | journal = Clinical Genetics | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 447–53 | date = June 1983 | pmid = 6883789 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.1983.tb01980.x | s2cid = 13544594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological ===
Social difficulties appear to be an area of vulnerability for young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCauley E, Feuillan P, Kushner H, Ross JL | title = Psychosocial development in adolescents with Turner syndrome | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 360–5 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11773800 | doi = 10.1097/00004703-200112000-00003 | s2cid = 39749059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling affected individuals and their families about the need to carefully develop social skills and relationships may prove useful in advancing social adaptation. Women with Turner syndrome may experience adverse psychosocial outcomes which can be improved through early intervention and the provision of appropriate psychological and psychiatric care. Genetic, hormonal, and medical problems associated with TS are likely to affect psychosexual development of female adolescent patients, and thus influence their psychological functioning, behavior patterns, social interactions, and learning ability. Although TS constitutes a chronic medical condition, with possible physical, social, and psychological complications in a woman's life, hormonal and estrogen replacement therapy, and assisted reproduction, are treatments that can be helpful for TS patients and improve their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christopoulos P, Deligeoroglou E, Laggari V, Christogiorgos S, Creatsas G | title = Psychological and behavioural aspects of patients with Turner syndrome from childhood to adulthood: a review of the clinical literature | journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–51 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 17852655 | doi = 10.1080/01674820701577078 | s2cid = 8149629 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows a possible association between age at diagnosis and increased  substance use and depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid29753544&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reimann GE, Bernad Perman MM, Ho PS, Parks RA, Comis LE | title = Psychosocial Characteristics of Women with a Delayed Diagnosis of Turner Syndrome | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 199 | pages = 206–211 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 29753544 | pmc = 6063780 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpeds.2018.03.058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This article has a delayed release (embargo) and will be available in PMC on August 1, 2019--&gt;

=== Reproductive ===
Women with Turner syndrome are almost universally [[infertility|infertile]].

Usually, estrogen replacement therapy is used to spur the growth of secondary sexual characteristics at the time when puberty should onset. While very few women with Turner syndrome menstruate spontaneously, estrogen therapy requires a regular shedding of the uterine lining (&quot;withdrawal bleeding&quot;) to prevent its overgrowth. Withdrawal bleeding can be induced monthly, like menstruation, or less often, usually every three months, if the patient desires. Estrogen therapy does not make a woman with nonfunctional ovaries fertile, but it plays an important role in assisted reproduction; the health of the uterus must be maintained with estrogen if an eligible woman with Turner Syndrome wishes to use IVF (using donated [[oocyte]]s).

Especially in mosaic cases of Turner syndrome that contains Y-chromosome (e.g. 45,X/46,XY) due to the risk of development of ovarian malignancy (most common is [[gonadoblastoma]]) gonadectomy is recommended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsheikh&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gravholt CH, Fedder J, Naeraa RW, Müller J | title = Occurrence of gonadoblastoma in females with Turner syndrome and Y chromosome material: a population study | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 85 | issue = 9 | pages = 3199–202 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10999808 | doi = 10.1210/jcem.85.9.6800 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner syndrome is characterized by primary [[amenorrhoea]], premature ovarian failure (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism), [[Gonadal dysgenesis|streak gonads]] and infertility (however, technology (especially oocyte donation) provides the opportunity of pregnancy in these patients). Failure to develop secondary sex characteristics (sexual infantilism) is typical.

As more women with Turner syndrome complete pregnancy thanks to modern techniques to treat infertility, it has to be noted that pregnancy may be a risk of cardiovascular complications for the mother. Indeed, several studies had suggested an increased risk for aortic dissection in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Lin /&gt; The influence of [[estrogen]] has been examined but remains unclear. It seems that the high risk of aortic dissection during pregnancy in women with Turner syndrome may be due to the increased hemodynamic load rather than the high estrogen level.&lt;ref name=Elsheikh /&gt;

=== Hearing ===
Recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) commonly occur in children with Turner syndrome during the preschool age, which can persist or develop later in childhood. The recurring AOM can also be a predisposition to cholesteatomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lim|first1=David|last2=Hassani|first2=Sarah|last3=Lupton|first3=Kenneth|last4=Gault|first4=Emma Jane|last5=Wynne|first5=David|last6=Clement|first6=William|last7=Kubba|first7=Haytham|last8=Mason|first8=Avril|last9=Donaldson|first9=Malcolm|date=2019-12-07|title=Prevalence, risk factors and management strategies for otological problems in girls with Turner syndrome|journal=Acta Paediatrica|volume=109|issue=10|pages=2075–2083|doi=10.1111/apa.15128|issn=1651-2227|pmid=31811789|s2cid=208814704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Parkin|first1=Monique|last2=Walker|first2=Paul|date=February 2009|title=Hearing loss in Turner syndrome|journal=International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology|volume=73|issue=2|pages=243–247|doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2008.10.012|issn=0165-5876|pmid=19081146}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with the monosomy 45, X karyotype have an increased rate of hearing loss over other TS karyotype variants.

== Cause ==
Turner syndrome is caused by the absence of one complete or partial copy of the X chromosome in some or all the cells. The abnormal cells may have only one X ([[monosomy]]) (45,X) or they may be affected by one of several types of [[Partial monosomy#Partial aneuploidy|partial monosomy]] like a deletion of the short [[p arm]] of one X chromosome (46,[[cytogenetic notation|X,del(Xp)]]) or the presence of an [[isochromosome]] with two q arms (46,X,i(Xq))&lt;ref name=Crespi2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crespi B | title = Turner syndrome and the evolution of human sexual dimorphism | journal = Evolutionary Applications | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 449–61 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 25567727 | pmc = 3352375 | doi = 10.1111/j.1752-4571.2008.00017.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner syndrome has distinct features due to the lack of [[pseudoautosomal region]]s, which are typically spared from X-inactivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEJM2004&quot;/&gt; In mosaic individuals, cells with X monosomy (45,X) may occur along with cells that are normal (46,XX), cells that have partial monosomies, or cells that have a Y chromosome (46,XY).&lt;ref name=Crespi2008 /&gt; The presence of mosaicism is estimated to be relatively common in affected individuals (67–90%).&lt;ref name=Crespi2008 /&gt;

=== Inheritance ===
In the majority of cases where monosomy occurs, the X chromosome comes from the mother.&lt;ref name=Monroy2002&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Monroy N, López M, Cervantes A, García-Cruz D, Zafra G, Canún S, Zenteno JC, Kofman-Alfaro S | title = Microsatellite analysis in Turner syndrome: parental origin of X chromosomes and possible mechanism of formation of abnormal chromosomes | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 181–9 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11807897 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.10113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to a [[nondisjunction]] in the father. [[Meiotic]] errors that lead to the production of X with p arm deletions or abnormal Y chromosomes are also mostly found in the father.&lt;ref name=Uematsu&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uematsu A, Yorifuji T, Muroi J, Kawai M, Mamada M, Kaji M, Yamanaka C, Momoi T, Nakahata T | title = Parental origin of normal X chromosomes in Turner syndrome patients with various karyotypes: implications for the mechanism leading to generation of a 45,X karyotype | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 111 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–9 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12210339 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.10506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isochromosome]] X or [[ring chromosome]] X on the other hand are formed equally often by both parents.&lt;ref name=Uematsu /&gt; Overall, the functional X chromosome usually comes from the mother.

In most cases, Turner syndrome is a sporadic event, and for the parents of an individual with Turner syndrome the risk of recurrence is not increased for subsequent pregnancies. Rare exceptions may include the presence of a balanced [[chromosomal translocation|translocation]] of the X chromosome in a parent, or where the mother has 45,X mosaicism restricted to her germ cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frías JL, Davenport ML | title = Health supervision for children with Turner syndrome | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 692–702 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12612263 | doi = 10.1542/peds.111.3.692 | author3 = Committee on Genetics Section on Endocrinology | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

=== Prenatal ===
[[File:45,X.jpg|thumb|right|45,X [[karyotype]], showing an unpaired X at the lower right]]
Turner syndrome may be diagnosed by [[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]] during pregnancy.

Usually, fetuses with Turner syndrome can be identified by abnormal [[ultrasound]] findings (''i.e.'', heart defect, kidney abnormality, [[cystic hygroma]], [[ascites]]). In a study of 19 European registries, 67.2% of prenatally diagnosed cases of Turner syndrome were detected by abnormalities on ultrasound. 69.1% of cases had one anomaly present, and 30.9% had two or more anomalies.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner-syndrom.dk&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loscalzo|first1=Melissa L.|last2=Bondy|first2=Carolyn A.|last3=Biesecker|first3=Barbara|title=Issues in prenatal counseling and diagnosis in Turner Syndrome|journal=International Congress Series|volume=1298|year=2006|pages=26–29|issn=0531-5131|doi=10.1016/j.ics.2006.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increased risk of Turner syndrome may also be indicated by abnormal triple or quadruple maternal serum screen. The fetuses diagnosed through positive maternal serum screening are more often found to have a mosaic karyotype than those diagnosed based on ultrasonographic abnormalities, and
conversely, those with mosaic karyotypes are less likely to have associated ultrasound abnormalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner-syndrom.dk&quot; /&gt;

=== Postnatal ===
Turner syndrome can be diagnosed postnatally at any age. Often, it is diagnosed at birth due to heart problems, an unusually wide neck or swelling of the hands and feet. However, it is also common for it to go undiagnosed for several years, often until the girl reaches the age of puberty and fails to develop typically (the changes associated with puberty do not occur). In childhood, a short stature can be indicative of Turner syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/turner_syndrome/page2.htm#tocd|title=Turner Syndrome Symptoms, Treatment, Causes – What are the symptoms for Turner syndrome? - MedicineNet|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218075158/http://www.medicinenet.com/turner_syndrome/page2.htm#tocd|archive-date=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A test called a [[karyotype]], also known as a chromosome analysis, analyzes the chromosomal composition of the individual. This is the test of choice to diagnose Turner syndrome.

== Treatment ==
As a chromosomal condition, there is no cure for Turner syndrome. However, much can be done to minimize the symptoms. For example:&lt;ref name=&quot;tss faq 6&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Turner Syndrome Society of the United States |title=FAQ 6.

* [[Growth hormone]], either alone or with a low dose of [[androgen]], will increase growth and probably final adult height. Growth hormone is approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] for treatment of Turner syndrome and is covered by many insurance plans.&lt;!--

* [[Hormone therapy|Estrogen replacement therapy]] such as the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]], has been used since the condition was described in 1938 to promote development of secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens are crucial for maintaining good bone integrity, cardiovascular health and tissue health.&lt;!--

* Uterine maturity is positively associated with years of estrogen use, history of spontaneous menarche, and negatively associated with the lack of current hormone replacement therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Uterine Development in Turner Syndrome |journal=GGH Journal |volume=24 |issue=1 |year=2008 |issn=1932-9032 |url=http://gghjournal.com/volume24/1/ab12.cfm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622212224/http://www.gghjournal.com/volume24/1/ab12.cfm |archive-date=2008-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner syndrome occurs in between one in 2000&lt;ref name=ArchDisChild/&gt; and one in 5000 females at birth.&lt;ref name=Mar2013/&gt;

In Russian and USSR literature it is called Shereshevsky–Turner syndrome to acknowledge that the condition was first described as hereditary in 1925 by the Soviet endocrinologist {{ill|Nikolai Shereshevsky|ru|Шерешевский, Николай Адольфович|lt=|WD=}}, who believed that it was due to the underdevelopment of the gonads and the [[Anterior pituitary|anterior pituitary gland]] and was combined with congenital malformations of internal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/553.html|title=Nikolai Adolfovich Shereshevsky|website=www.whonamedit.com|access-date=2019-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''LGM-30 Minuteman''' is a U.S. land-based [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM), in service with the [[Air Force Global Strike Command]]. {{As of|2020}}, the '''LGM-30G Minuteman III''' version{{efn|The letter &quot;L&quot; in &quot;LGM&quot; indicates that the missile is [[missile silo|silo]]-launched; the &quot;G&quot; indicates that it is designed to attack ground targets; the &quot;M&quot; indicates that it is a [[guided missile]].}} is the only land-based ICBM in service in the United States and represents the land leg of the U.S. [[nuclear triad]], along with the [[Trident (missile)|Trident]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SLBM) and nuclear weapons carried by long-range [[strategic bomber]]s.

Development of the Minuteman began in the mid-1950s when basic research indicated that a [[solid fuel rocket]] motor could stand ready to launch for long periods of time, in contrast to [[liquid-fueled rocket]]s that required fueling before launch and so might be destroyed in a surprise attack. The missile was named for the Colonial [[Minutemen (militia)|Minutemen]] of the [[American Revolutionary War]], who could be ready to fight on short notice.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSIS-UCC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CSIS-2009&quot; /&gt;

The Minuteman entered service in 1962 as a [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] weapon that could hit Soviet cities with a [[second strike]] and [[countervalue]] counterattack if the U.S. was attacked. However, the development of the [[United States Navy]] (USN) [[UGM-27 Polaris]], which addressed the same role, allowed the Air Force to modify the Minuteman, boosting its accuracy enough to attack hardened military targets, including Soviet missile silos. The Minuteman-II entered service in 1965 with a host of upgrades to improve its accuracy and survivability in the face of an [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) system the Soviets were known to be developing. In 1970, the Minuteman-III became the first deployed ICBM with [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s (MIRV): three smaller warheads that improved the missile's ability to strike targets defended by ABMs.&lt;ref name=&quot;NWA19971007&quot; /&gt; They were initially armed with the W62 warhead with a [[nuclear weapon yield|yield]] of 170 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]].

By the 1970s, 1,000 Minutemen were deployed. This force has shrunk to 400 Minuteman-III missiles {{as of|2017|9|lc=on}}&lt;ref name=&quot;2009_Norris&quot; /&gt; deployed in [[missile silo]]s around [[Malmstrom Air Force Base|Malmstrom AFB]], [[Montana]]; [[Minot Air Force Base|Minot AFB]], [[North Dakota]]; and [[Francis E.

== History ==
[[File:Minuteman I.jpg|thumb|Minuteman-I missile]]

=== Edward Hall and solid fuels ===
Minuteman owes its existence largely to Air Force Colonel [[Edward N. Hall]], who in 1956 was given charge of the solid-fuel-propulsion division of [[Bernard Adolph Schriever|General Bernard Schriever's]] [[Western Development Division]], created to lead development of the [[SM-65 Atlas]] and [[HGM-25A Titan I]] ICBMs. Solid fuels were already commonly used in short-range rockets. Hall's superiors were interested in [[short range ballistic missile|short-]] and [[medium range ballistic missile|medium]]-range missiles with solids, especially for use in Europe where the fast reaction time was an advantage for weapons that might be attacked by Soviet aircraft. But Hall was convinced that they could be used for a true ICBM with {{convert|5500|nmi}} range.&lt;ref name=&quot;1990_MacKenzie&quot; /&gt;{{rp|page=152}}

To achieve the required energy, that year Hall began funding research at [[Boeing]] and [[Thiokol]] into the use of [[ammonium perchlorate composite propellant]]. Adapting a concept developed in the UK, they cast the fuel into large cylinders with a star-shaped hole running along the inner axis. This allowed the fuel to burn along the entire length of the cylinder, rather than just the end as in earlier designs. The increased burn rate meant increased thrust. This also meant the heat was spread across the entire motor, instead of the end, and because it burned from the inside out it did not reach the wall of the missile fuselage until the fuel was finished burning. In comparison, older designs burned primarily from one end to the other, meaning that at any instant one small section of the fuselage was being subjected to extreme loads and temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maugh&quot; /&gt;

Guidance of an ICBM is based not only on the direction the missile is traveling but the precise instant that thrust is cut off. Too much thrust and the warhead will overshoot its target, too little and it will fall short. Solids are normally very hard to predict in terms of burning time and their instantaneous thrust during the burn, which made them questionable for the sort of accuracy required to hit a target at intercontinental range. This appeared at first to be an insurmountable problem, but in the end, it was solved in an almost trivial fashion. A series of ports were added inside the rocket nozzle that was opened when the guidance systems called for engine cut-off. The reduction in pressure was so abrupt that the last burning fuel ejected itself and the flame was extinguished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maugh&quot; /&gt;

The first to use these developments was the US Navy. They had been involved in a joint program with the [[US Army]] to develop the liquid-fueled [[PGM-19 Jupiter]], but had always been skeptical of the system. They felt that liquid fuels were too dangerous to use onboard ships, especially submarines. Rapid success in the solids development program, combined with [[Edward Teller]]'s promise of much lighter [[nuclear warhead]]s during [[Project Nobska]], led the Navy to abandon Jupiter and begin development of their own solid-fuel missile. Aerojet's work with Hall was adapted for their [[UGM-27 Polaris]] starting in December 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;2001Teller&quot; /&gt;

===Missile farm concept===
The US Air Force saw no pressing need for a solid fuel ICBM. Development of the [[SM-65 Atlas]] and [[SM-68 Titan]] ICBMs was progressing, and &quot;storable&quot; liquids were being developed that would allow missiles to be left in a ready-to-shoot form for extended periods. Hall saw solid fuels not only as a way to improve launch times or safety, but part of a radical plan to greatly reduce the cost of ICBMs so that thousands could be built. He was aware that new computerized [[assembly line]]s would allow continual production, and that similar equipment would allow a small team to oversee operations for dozens or hundreds of missiles. A solid fuel design would be simpler to build, and easier to maintain.&lt;ref name=&quot;1990_MacKenzie&quot; /&gt;{{rp|page=153}}

Hall's ultimate plan was to build a number of integrated missiles &quot;farms&quot; that included factories, [[Missile launch facility|missile silos]], transport and recycling. Each farm would support between 1,000 and 1,500 missiles being produced in a continuous low rate cycle. Systems in a missile would detect failures, at which point it would be removed and recycled, while a newly built missile would take its place.&lt;ref name=&quot;1990_MacKenzie&quot; /&gt;{{rp|page=153}} The missile design was based purely on lowest possible cost, reducing its size and complexity because &quot;the basis of the weapon's merit was its low cost per completed mission; all other factors – accuracy, vulnerability, and reliability – were secondary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1990_MacKenzie&quot; /&gt;{{rp|page=154}}

Hall's plan did not go unopposed, especially by the more established names in the ICBM field. [[TRW Inc.|Ramo-Wooldridge]] pressed for a system with higher accuracy, but Hall countered that the missile's role was to attack Soviet cities, and that &quot;a force which provides numerical superiority over the enemy will provide a much stronger deterrent than a numerically inferior force of greater accuracy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1990_MacKenzie&quot; /&gt;{{rp|page=154}} Hall was known for his &quot;friction with others&quot; and in 1958 Schriever removed him from the Minuteman project and sent him to the UK to oversee deployment of the [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor IRBM]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1990_MacKenzie&quot; /&gt;{{rp|page=152}} On his return to the US in 1959, Hall retired from the Air Force, but received his second [[Legion of Merit]] in 1960 for his work on solid fuels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maugh&quot; /&gt;

Although he was removed from the Minuteman project, Hall's work on cost reduction had already produced a new design of {{convert|71|in|m}} diameter, much smaller than the Atlas and Titan at {{convert|120|in|m}}, which meant smaller and cheaper silos. Hall's goal of dramatic cost reduction was a success, although many of the other concepts of his missile farm were abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;1990_MacKenzie&quot; /&gt;{{rp|page=154}}

Russians were now presented as the most advanced and least chauvinist people of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Overy 2004 558&quot;/&gt;

Ethnic Russians were sent to colonize captured territory such as [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}, while local languages, religions and customs were banned or suppressed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]] was also used both as a military strategy to extinguish opposition to Soviet expansion{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}, and as a continuation of the Russification policy of assimilating{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}, or failing that, eliminating ethnic minorities{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} through exile to a distant territory such as [[Siberia]].

====Jewish oblast====
[[File:Government-hq.jpg|thumb|upright|Sign on the JAO government headquarters.]]
In 1934, the Soviet government established the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] in the Soviet Far East to create a homeland for the Jewish people. Another motive was to strengthen Soviet presence along the vulnerable eastern border. The region was often infiltrated by the Chinese; in 1927, Chiang-Kai-Shek had ended [[First United Front|cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party]], which further increased the threat. Fascist Japan also seemed willing and ready to detach the Far Eastern provinces from the USSR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nora Levin 1990 283&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Nora Levin|title=The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917: Paradox of Survival, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Nz0N5GBW6MC|year=1990|publisher=New York University Press|page=283|isbn=9780814750513}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make settlement of the inhospitable and undeveloped region more enticing, the Soviet government allowed private ownership of land. This led to many non-Jews to settle in the oblast to get a free farm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Overy 2004 567&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Overy|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32Vy2Fj4KFUC|year=2004|publisher=W.W Norton Company, Inc|page=567|isbn=9780141912240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, a massive propaganda campaign developed to induce more Jewish settlers to move there. In one instance, a government-produced Yiddish film called ''[[Seekers of Happiness]]'' told the story of a Jewish family that fled the [[Great Depression]] in the [[United States]] to make a new life for itself in Birobidzhan. Some 1,200 non-Soviet Jews chose to settle in Birobidzhan.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishmag.com&quot;&gt;Arthur Rosen, [www./75mag/birobidzhan/birobidzhan.htm], February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish population peaked in 1948 at around 30,000, about one-quarter of the region's population. By 2010, according to data provided by the Russian Census Bureau, there were  only 1,628 people of Jewish descent remaining in the JAO (1% of the total population), while ethnic Russians made up 92.7% of the JAO population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/population/demo/per-itog/tab7.xls |title=Информационные материалы об окончательных итогах Всероссийской переписи населения 2010 года |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JAO is Russia's only [[autonomous oblast]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of the Russian Federation]], Article 65&lt;/ref&gt; and, aside of Israel, the world's only Jewish territory with an official status.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite journal|author=Спектор Р., руководитель Департамента Евро-Азиатского Еврейского конгресса (ЕАЕК) по связям с общественностью и СМИ|title=Биробиджан — terra incognita?|url=http://www.nasledie-eao.ru/services/nayka/scientific-practical-conference/bir_proekt_konf_2007.pdf#page=18|editor=под ред.

===Israel===
According to the Palestinian narrative, the modern [[State of Israel]] may be considered a form of colonization by Jewish peoples from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cm|first1=The Rev Dr Michael Prior|last2=Prior|first2=Michael|title=Zionism and the State of Israel: A Moral Inquiry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mg_9qEmkISsC|date= 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-62877-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mg_9qEmkISsC&amp;pg=PT232 232]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, alleged Israeli settlements in the [[West Bank]] may be considered an additional form of colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zureik|first=Elia|title=Israel's Colonial Project in Palestine: Brutal Pursuit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vsf4CgAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34046-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vsf4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=settler%20colonialism]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view is not accepted worldwide, but rather a key debate in the [[Israeli-Palestinian Conflict]].

The transmigration program is an initiative of the [[government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]] to move landless people from densely populated areas of [[Java (island)|Java]], but also to a lesser extent from [[Bali]] and [[Madura Island|Madura]],  to less populous areas of the country including [[West Papua (region)|Papua]], [[Kalimantan]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Sulawesi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/02/govt-builds-transmigration-museum-lampung.html|title=Govt builds transmigration museum in Lampung &amp;#124; The Jakarta Post|date=June 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604015847/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/02/govt-builds-transmigration-museum-lampung.html|archive-date=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Papua New Guinea ===
{{Seealso|Bougainville Civil War}}In 1884 Britain declared a protective order over South East New Guinea, establishing an official colony in 1888. Germany however, annexed parts of the North.

===Expatriate colonies===
Mass migrations such as [[Chinese emigration]] or the [[British diaspora]] or [[German diaspora]] have resulted in colonies abroad. In some cases, [[expatriate]] niches set up permanently in target countries masked under the spread of &quot;religion and culture&quot;. The intentions behind the movement and settling of expatriates and in many cases (especially when not gathered into a niche ''per se'') expatriates do not necessarily seek to &quot;expand their native civilization&quot;, but rather to [[Racial integration|integrate]] into the population of the new civilization for economic purposes. It must be recognized that expatriates are different from [[exiles]] and often there is very little if no relationship between them. Exiles are more often than not diasporic or displaced communities or persons who have fled their native territory or homeland to somewhere else and are usually in this position due to the results of war or other major political upheavals and sometimes this includes the influence of colonization.

===Subject peoples===
Many human colonists came to colonies for [[Slavery|slaves]] to their colonizing countries, so the legal power to leave or remain may not be the issue so much as the actual presence of the people in the new country. This left the indigenous natives of their lands &quot;slaves&quot; in their own countries.

The [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] was identified by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)]] as colonization through depriving the youth of First Nations in Canada of their languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|last=The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|year=2015|isbn=978-0-660-02078-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid 20th century, there was the most dramatic and devastating attempt at colonization, and that was pursued with Nazism.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Stephen|title=Empire: A Very Short Introduction|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler and Heinrich Himmler and their supporters schemed for a mass migration of Germans to Eastern Europe, where some of the Germans were to become colonists, having control over the native people.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2&quot; /&gt; These indigenous people were planned to be reduced to slaves or wholly annihilated.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2&quot; /&gt;

Many advanced nations currently have large numbers of [[guest worker]]s/[[temporary work]] visa holders who are brought in to do seasonal work such as harvesting or to do low-paid manual labor. Guest workers or contractors have a lower status than workers with visas, because guest workers can be removed at any time for any reason.

===Endo-colonization===
Colonization may be a domestic strategy when there is a widespread security threat within a nation and weapons are turned inward, as noted by [[Paul Virilio]]:
:Obsession with security results in the ''endo-colonization'' of society: endo-colonization is the use of increasingly powerful and ubiquitous technologies of security turned ''inward'', to attempt to secure the fast and messy circulations of our globalizing, networked society…it is the increasing domination of public life with stories of dangerous otherness and suspicion…&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lacy (2014) ''Security, Technology and Global Politics, thinking with Virilio'', page 20, Routledge {{ISBN|978-0-415-57604-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some instances of the burden of endo-colonization have been noted:
:The acute difficulties of the Latin American and southern European military-bureaucratic dictatorships in the seventies and early eighties and the Soviet Union in the late eighties can in large part be attributed to the economic, political and social contradictions induced by endo-colonizing militarism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Luke]] &amp; [[Gearoid O Tuathail]] (2000) &quot;Thinking Geopolitical Space: The spatiality of war, speed and vision in the work of Paul Virilio&quot;, in ''Thinking Space'', [[Mike Crang]] &amp; [[Nigel Thrift]] editors, [[Routledge]], quote page  368&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space colonization===
There has been a continued interest and advocation for [[space colonization]], and as such criticized as unreflected continuation of [[settler colonialism]] and [[manifest destiny]], continuing the narrative of colonial exploration as fundamental to the assumed [[human nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The racist language of space exploration|url=https://theoutline.com/post/5809/the-racist-language-of-space-exploration|website=The Outline|accessdate=20 September 2019|date=14 August 2018|author=Caroline Haskins|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016235916/https://theoutline.com/post/5809/the-racist-language-of-space-exploration|archive-date=16 October 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When discussing Humanity's next move to space, the language we use matters.|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/urban-scientist/when-discussing-humanity-8217-s-next-move-to-space-the-language-we-use-matters/|website=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=20 September 2019|date=26 March 2015|author=DNLee|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914011756/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/urban-scientist/when-discussing-humanity-8217-s-next-move-to-space-the-language-we-use-matters/|archive-date=14 September 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2018-11-09|title=We need to change the way we talk about space exploration|first=Nadia|last=Drake|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|access-date=2019-10-19|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/11/we-need-to-change-way-we-talk-about-space-exploration-mars/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016235826/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/11/we-need-to-change-way-we-talk-about-space-exploration-mars/|archive-date=2019-10-16|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Representation of the People Act 1832''' (also known as the '''1832 Reform Act''', '''Great Reform Act''' or '''First Reform Act''') was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (indexed as [[2 &amp; 3 Will. IV]] c. 45) that introduced major changes to the [[Voting system|electoral system]] of [[England and Wales]]. It abolished tiny districts, gave representation to cities, gave the vote to small landowners, tenant farmers, shopkeepers, householders who paid a yearly rental of £10 or more, and some lodgers. Only qualifying men were able to vote; the Act introduced the first explicit statutory bar to women voting, by defining a voter as a male person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The Reform Act 1832|url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/houseofcommons/reformacts/overview/reformact1832/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-03|website=UK Parliament|language=English|quote=Another change brought by the 1832 Reform Act was the formal exclusion of women from voting in Parliamentary elections, as a voter was defined in the Act as a male person. Before 1832 there were occasional, although rare, instances of women voting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed to correct abuses – to &quot;take effectual Measures for correcting divers Abuses that have long prevailed in the Choice of Members to serve in the [[British House of Commons|Commons House of Parliament]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Reform Act 1832|Reform Act 1832]]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the reform, most members nominally represented [[borough]]s. The number of electors in a borough varied widely, from a dozen or so up to 12,000. Frequently the selection of [[Member of parliament|MP]]s was effectively controlled by one powerful patron: for example [[Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk]], controlled eleven boroughs. Criteria for qualification for the [[Suffrage|franchise]] varied greatly among boroughs, from the requirement to own land, to merely living in a house with a [[hearth]] sufficient to boil a pot.

There had been calls for reform long before 1832, but without success. The Act that finally succeeded was proposed by the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], led by Prime Minister [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]]. It met with significant opposition from the [[:Tory (British political party)#Pitt|Pittite]] factions in Parliament, who had long governed the country; opposition was especially pronounced in the [[House of Lords]]. Nevertheless, the bill was eventually passed, mainly as a result of public pressure. The Act granted seats in the House of Commons to large cities that had sprung up during the [[Industrial Revolution]], and removed seats from the &quot;[[rotten borough]]s&quot;: those with very small electorates and usually dominated by a wealthy patron. The Act also increased the electorate from about 400,000 to 650,000, making about one in five adult males eligible to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=John A.|last2=Wetherell|first2=Charles|date=1995|title=The Great Reform Act of 1832 and the Political Modernization of England|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=100|issue=2|pages=411–436|doi=10.2307/2169005|jstor=2169005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full title is ''An Act to amend the representation of the people in England and Wales''. Its formal [[short title]] and citation is &quot;Representation of the People Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Wm. IV, c. 45)&quot;. The Act applied only in England and Wales; the [[Irish Reform Act 1832]] brought similar changes to Ireland. The separate [[Scottish Reform Act 1832]] was revolutionary, enlarging the electorate by a factor of 13 from 5,000 to 65,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Allan Houston|title=Scotland: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqAUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|year=2008|page=26|isbn=9780199230792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unreformed House of Commons==
{{Main|Unreformed House of Commons}}

===Composition===
[[File:House of Commons Microcosm.jpg|thumb|The House of Commons is the [[lower house]] of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.]]

After the [[Acts of Union 1800]]  became law on 1 January 1801, the unreformed House of Commons was composed of 658 members, of whom 513 represented England and Wales. There were two types of constituencies; counties and boroughs. County members were supposed to represent landholders, while borough members were supposed to represent the mercantile and trading interests of the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone (1765), pp. 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt; Counties were historical national subdivisions established between the 8th and 16th centuries. They were not merely parliamentary constituencies; many components of government (including [[court]]s and the [[militia]]) were organised along county lines.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone (1765), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; The members of Parliament chosen by the counties were known as [[Knights of the Shire]]. In Wales each county elected one member, while in England each county elected two members until 1826, when Yorkshire's representation was increased to four, following the disenfranchisement of the Cornish borough of [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]].

Parliamentary boroughs in England ranged widely in size from small hamlets to large cities, partly because they had evolved haphazardly. The earliest boroughs were chosen in the Middle Ages by county sheriffs, and even a village might be deemed a borough.&lt;ref&gt;''Parliamentary Representation of English Boroughs in the Middle Ages'' by May McKisack, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these early boroughs (such as [[Winchelsea (UK Parliament constituency)|Winchelsea]] and [[Dunwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunwich]]) were substantial settlements at the time of their original enfranchisement, but later went into decline, and by the early 19th century some only had a few electors, but still elected two [[Member of parliament|MPs]]; they were often known as [[rotten boroughs]]. In later centuries the reigning monarch decided which settlements to enfranchise. The monarchs seem mostly to have done so capriciously, often with little regard for the merits of the places they were enfranchising. Of the 70 English boroughs that Tudor monarchs enfranchised, 31 were later disenfranchised.&lt;ref&gt;The Elizabethan House of Commons – J E. Neale 1949 pages 133–134. Grampound was one of the 31 boroughs disenfranchised but was disenfranchised prior to the Reform Act in 1821.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the parliamentarians of the 17th century compounded the inconsistencies by re-enfranchising 15 boroughs whose representation had lapsed for centuries, seven of which were later disenfranchised by the Reform Act. After [[Newark (UK Parliament constituency)|Newark]] was enfranchised in 1661, no additional boroughs were enfranchised, and the unfair system remained unchanged until the Reform Act of 1832. Grampound's disenfranchisement in 1821 was the sole exception. Most English boroughs elected two MPs; but five boroughs elected only one MP: [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon]], [[Banbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Banbury]], [[Bewdley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bewdley]], [[Higham Ferrers (UK Parliament constituency)|Higham Ferrers]] and [[Monmouth]]. The [[City of London]] and the joint borough of [[Weymouth and Melcombe Regis (UK Parliament constituency)|Weymouth and Melcombe Regis]] each elected four members. The Welsh boroughs each returned a single member.

===The franchise===
Statutes passed in 1430 and 1432, during the reign of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], standardised property qualifications for county voters. Under these Acts, all owners of [[fee simple|freehold property]] or land worth at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county. This requirement, known as the [[Forty Shilling Freeholders|forty shilling freehold]], was never adjusted for inflation; thus the amount of land one had to own in order to vote gradually diminished over time.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone (1765), pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise was restricted to males by custom rather than statute;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The History of the Parliamentary Franchise|chapter-url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP13-14|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=1 March 2013|chapter=Ancient voting rights|page=6|last1=Johnston|first1=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; on rare occasions women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections as a result of property ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heater|first1=Derek|title=Citizenship in Britain: A History|date=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=9780748626724|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=js-qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the vast majority of people were not entitled to vote; the size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips and Wetherell (1995), p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the sizes of the individual county constituencies varied significantly. The smallest counties, [[Rutland]] and [[Anglesey]], had fewer than 1,000 voters each, while the largest county, [[Yorkshire]], had more than 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;Thorne (1986), vol. II, pp. 331, 435, 480.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who owned property in multiple constituencies could [[plural voting|vote multiple times]]. Not only was this typically legal (since there was usually no need for a property owner to live in a constituency in order to vote there) it was also feasible, even with the technology of the time, since polling was usually held over several days and rarely if ever did different constituencies vote on the same day.

In boroughs the franchise was far more varied. There were broadly six types of parliamentary boroughs, as defined by their franchise:
# Boroughs in which freemen were electors;
# Boroughs in which the franchise was restricted to those paying [[scot and lot]], a form of municipal taxation;
# Boroughs in which only the ownership of a [[burgage]] property qualified a person to vote;
# Boroughs in which only members of the corporation were electors (such boroughs were perhaps in every case &quot;[[pocket borough]]s&quot;, because council members were usually &quot;in the pocket&quot; of a wealthy patron);
# Boroughs in which male householders were electors (these were usually known as &quot;[[potwalloper]] boroughs&quot;, as the usual definition of a householder was a person able to boil a pot on his/her own hearth);
# Boroughs in which freeholders of land had the right to vote.

Some boroughs had a combination of these varying types of franchise, and most had special rules and exceptions,&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, pp. 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt; so many boroughs had a form of franchise that was unique to themselves.

The largest borough, [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]], had about 12,000 voters, while many of the smallest, usually known as &quot;rotten boroughs&quot;, had fewer than 100 each.&lt;ref&gt;Thorne (1986), vol. II, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous rotten borough was [[Old Sarum (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Sarum]], which had 13 burgage plots that could be used to &quot;manufacture&quot; electors if necessary—usually around half a dozen was thought sufficient. Other examples were [[Dunwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunwich]] (32 voters), [[Camelford (UK Parliament constituency)|Camelford]] (25), and [[Gatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Gatton]] (7).&lt;ref&gt;Thorne (1986), vol. II, pp. 50, 369, 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, France in 1831 had a population of 32&amp;nbsp;million, about double the 16.5&amp;nbsp;million in England, Wales and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;There were an additional 7.8 million in Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;  But there were only 165,000 French voters (0.52% of the French population), compared to 439,000 in Britain (2.66% of the British population).  France adopted universal male suffrage in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman Kent, &quot;Electoral lists of France's July Monarchy, 1830-1848.&quot; ''French Historical Studies'' (1971): 117-127. p 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women's suffrage====
The claim for the women's vote appears to have been first made by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in 1817 when he published his ''Plan of Parliamentary Reform in the form of a Catechism'',&lt;ref&gt;London: R. Hunter.&lt;/ref&gt; and was taken up by [[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]] in 1825, when he published, with [[Anna Wheeler (author)|Anna Wheeler]], ''An Appeal of One Half the Human Race, Women, Against the Pretensions of the Other Half, Men, to Retain Them in Political, and Thence in Civil and Domestic Slavery: In Reply to Mr. Mill's Celebrated Article on Government''.&lt;ref&gt;London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, Brown &amp; Green.&lt;/ref&gt; In the &quot;celebrated article on Government&quot;, [[James Mill]] had stated:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;all those individuals whose interests are indisputably included in those of other individuals may be struck off without any inconvenience ... In this light also women may be regarded, the interests of almost all of whom are involved in that of their fathers or in that of their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Mazlish|title=James and John Stuart Mill: Father and Son in the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3gIdLgiEiIC&amp;pg=PA86|year=1988|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=86|isbn=9781412826792|author-link=Bruce Mazlish}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The passing of the Act seven years later enfranchising &quot;male persons&quot; was, however, a more significant event; it has been argued that it was the inclusion of the word &quot;male&quot;, thus providing the first explicit statutory bar to women voting, which provided a focus of attack and a source of resentment from which, in time, the women's suffrage movement grew.&lt;ref&gt;Rover (1967), p. 3. The rejection of the claims of certain women to be placed on the electoral roll was subsequently confirmed, in spite of the [[Interpretation Act 1850]] (13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. 21) which specified that the masculine gender should include the feminine unless otherwise provided, in ''Chorlton v. Lings'' [1868] 4CP 374. In the case of ''Regina v. Harrald'' [1872] 7QB 361 it was ruled that married women, otherwise qualified, could not vote in municipal elections. This decision made it clear that married women would be excluded from the operation of any Act enfranchising women for the parliamentary vote, unless special provision to the contrary was made.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pocket boroughs, bribery&lt;!-- and intimidation --&gt;===
[[File:William Hogarth 032.jpg|thumb|''Canvassing for Votes'', part of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[Humours of an Election]]'' series, depicts the political corruption endemic in election campaigns prior to the Great Reform Act.]]

Many constituencies, especially those with small electorates, were under the control of rich landowners, and were known as nomination boroughs or [[pocket borough]]s, because they were said to be in the pockets of their patrons. Most patrons were noblemen or landed gentry who could use their local influence, prestige, and wealth to sway the voters. This was particularly true in rural counties, and in small boroughs situated near a large landed estate. Some noblemen even controlled multiple constituencies: for example, the [[Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] controlled eleven, while the [[James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale|Earl of Lonsdale]] controlled nine.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1821, [[Sydney Smith]] proclaimed that &quot;The country belongs to the Duke of Rutland, Lord Lonsdale, the Duke of Newcastle, and about twenty other holders of boroughs. They are our masters!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Holland and Austin (1855), vol. II, pp. 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. H. B. Oldfield]] claimed in his ''Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland'' that, out of the 514 members representing England and Wales, about 370 were selected by nearly 180 patrons.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, pp. 361–362.&lt;/ref&gt; A member who represented a pocket borough was expected to vote as his patron ordered, or else lose his seat at the next election.

Voters in some constituencies resisted outright domination by powerful landlords, but were often open to corruption. Electors were bribed individually in some boroughs, and collectively in others. In 1771, for example, it was revealed that 81 voters in [[New Shoreham (UK Parliament constituency)|New Shoreham]] (who constituted a majority of the electorate) formed a corrupt organisation that called itself the &quot;Christian Club&quot;, and regularly sold the borough to the highest bidder.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially notorious for their corruption were the &quot;[[nabob]]s&quot;, or individuals who had amassed fortunes in the British colonies in Asia and the [[West Indies]]. The nabobs, in some cases, even managed to wrest control of boroughs from the nobility and the gentry.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Lord Chatham]], Prime Minister of Great Britain during the 1760s, casting an eye on the fortunes made in India commented that &quot;the importers of foreign gold have forced their way into Parliament, by such a torrent of corruption as no private hereditary fortune could resist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roderick Cavaliero|title=Strangers in the Land: The Rise and Decline of the British Indian Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xE4BAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|year=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=65|isbn=9780857717078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement for reform==

===Early attempts at reform===
[[File:Pitt the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Pitt the Younger]] was a prominent advocate of parliamentary reform.]]

During the 1640s, England endured a [[English Civil War|civil war]] that pitted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]. In 1647, different factions of the victorious parliamentary army held a series of discussions, the [[Putney Debates]], on reforming the structure of English government. The most radical elements proposed universal manhood suffrage and the reorganisation of parliamentary constituencies. Their leader [[Thomas Rainsborough]] declared, &quot;I think it's clear, that every man that is to live under a government ought first by his own consent to put himself under that government.&quot;

More conservative members disagreed, arguing instead that only individuals who owned land in the country should be allowed to vote. For example, [[Henry Ireton]] stated, &quot;no man hath a right to an interest or share in the disposing of the affairs of the kingdom ... that hath not a permanent fixed interest in this kingdom.&quot; The views of the conservative &quot;Grandees&quot; eventually won out. [[Oliver Cromwell]], who became the leader of England after the abolition of the monarchy in 1649, refused to adopt universal suffrage; individuals were required to own property (real or personal) worth at least £200 in order to vote. He did nonetheless agree to some electoral reform; he disfranchised several small boroughs, granted representation to large towns such as [[Manchester]] and [[Leeds]], and increased the number of members elected by populous counties.  These reforms were all reversed, however, after Cromwell's death and the last parliament to be elected in the Commonwealth period in 1659 reverted to the electoral system as it had existed under Charles I.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon (1973), cap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 the issue of parliamentary reform lay dormant; [[James II of England|James II]]'s attempt to remodel municipal corporations to gain control of their borough seats created an antipathy to any change after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. It was revived in the 1760s by the Whig Prime Minister [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]] (&quot;Pitt the Elder&quot;), who called borough representation &quot;the rotten part of [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|our Constitution]]&quot; (hence the term &quot;rotten borough&quot;). Nevertheless, he did not advocate an immediate disfranchisement of rotten boroughs. He instead proposed that a third member be added to each county, to countervail the borough influence. The Whigs failed to unite behind the expansion of county representation; some objected to the idea because they felt that it would give too much power to the aristocracy and gentry in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, despite Chatham's exertions, Parliament took no action on his proposals.

The cause of parliamentary reform was next taken up by Lord Chatham's son, [[William Pitt the Younger]] (variously described as a Tory and as an &quot;independent Whig&quot;). Like his father, he shrank from proposing the wholesale abolition of the rotten boroughs, advocating instead an increase in county representation. The House of Commons rejected Pitt's resolution by over 140 votes, despite receiving petitions for reform bearing over twenty thousand signatures.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1783, Pitt became Prime Minister but was still unable to achieve reform. [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] was averse to the idea, as were many members of Pitt's own cabinet. In 1786, the Prime Minister proposed a reform bill, but the House of Commons rejected it on a 174–248 vote.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, pp. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt did not raise the issue again for the remainder of his term.

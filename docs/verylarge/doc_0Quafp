With less than 0.2 lunar masses, Pluto is much less massive than the [[terrestrial planet]]s, and also less massive than seven [[natural satellite|moons]]: [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Io (moon)|Io]], the [[Moon]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and Triton. The mass is much less than thought before Charon was discovered.

Pluto is more than twice the diameter and a dozen times the mass of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], the largest object in the [[asteroid belt]]. It is less massive than the dwarf planet [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a [[trans-Neptunian object]] discovered in 2005, though Pluto has a larger diameter of 2376.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;ref name=&quot;Nimmo2017&quot; /&gt; compared to Eris's approximate diameter of 2326&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewHorizons_PlutoSize&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/how-big-is-pluto-new-horizons-settles-decades-long-debate |title=How Big Is Pluto?

{{Main|Moons of Pluto}}
Pluto has five known [[natural satellite]]s. The closest to Pluto is [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]. First identified in 1978 by astronomer [[James W. Christy|James Christy]], Charon is the only moon of Pluto that may be in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]; Charon's mass is sufficient to cause the barycenter of the Pluto–Charon system to be outside Pluto. Beyond Charon there are four much smaller [[circumbinary]] moons. In order of distance from Pluto they are Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. [[Nix (moon)|Nix]] and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]] were both discovered in 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gugliotta2005&quot; /&gt; [[Kerberos (moon)|Kerberos]] was discovered in 2011,&lt;ref name=&quot;P4&quot; /&gt; and [[Styx (moon)|Styx]] was discovered in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/16531-pluto-fifth-moon-hubble-discovery.html |title=Pluto Has a Fifth Moon, Hubble Telescope Reveals |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=July 11, 2012 |work=Space.com |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellites' orbits are circular (eccentricity &lt; 0.006) and coplanar with Pluto's equator (inclination &lt; 1°),&lt;ref name=&quot;Buie2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Astronomical Journal |last1=Buie |first1=M. |last2=Tholen |first2=D. |last3=Grundy |first3=W. |title=The Orbit of Charon is Circular |year=2012 |volume=144 |issue=1 |pages=15 |doi=10.1088/0004-6256/144/1/15 |bibcode=2012AJ....144...15B|s2cid=15009477 |url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bfb8/1eb1887c28df5f5348a491cff7d4870e8c77.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShowalterHamilton2015&quot; /&gt; and therefore tilted approximately 120° relative to Pluto's orbit.

The Pluto–Charon system is one of the few in the Solar System whose barycenter lies outside the primary body; the [[617 Patroclus|Patroclus–Menoetius]] system is a smaller example, and the [[Jupiter#Mass and size|Sun–Jupiter]] system is the only larger one.&lt;ref name=&quot;RichardsonWalsh2005&quot; /&gt; The similarity in size of Charon and Pluto has prompted some astronomers to call it a [[double planet|double dwarf planet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sicardyetal2006nature&quot; /&gt; The system is also unusual among planetary systems in that each is [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to the other, which means that Pluto and Charon always have the same hemisphere facing each other. From any position on either body, the other is always at the same position in the sky, or always obscured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young1997&quot; /&gt; This also means that the rotation period of each is equal to the time it takes the entire system to rotate around its barycenter.&lt;ref name=&quot;axis&quot; /&gt;

In 2007, observations by the [[Gemini Observatory]] of patches of ammonia hydrates and water crystals on the surface of Charon suggested the presence of active cryo-geysers.&lt;ref name=&quot;spaceflightnow2007 Ice machine&quot; /&gt;

Pluto's true place in the [[Solar System]] began to reveal itself only in 1992, when astronomers began to find small icy objects beyond Neptune that were similar to Pluto not only in orbit but also in size and composition. This trans-Neptunian population is thought to be the source of many [[short-period comet]]s. Pluto is now known to be the largest member of the [[Kuiper belt]],{{efn|name = wiki-kbo}} a stable belt of objects located between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun. As of 2011, surveys of the Kuiper belt to magnitude 21 were nearly complete and any remaining Pluto-sized objects are expected to be beyond 100&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheppard2011&quot; /&gt; Like other Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs), Pluto shares features with [[comet]]s; for example, the [[solar wind]] is gradually blowing Pluto's surface into space.&lt;ref name=&quot;pluto.jhuapl cousin&quot; /&gt; It has been claimed that if Pluto were placed as near to the Sun as Earth, it would develop a tail, as comets do.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyson1999&quot; /&gt; This claim has been disputed with the argument that Pluto's escape velocity is too high for this to happen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/nine-reasons-why-pluto-is-a-planet/ &quot;Nine Reasons Why Pluto Is a Planet&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415183323/http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/nine-reasons-why-pluto-is-a-planet/ |date=April 15, 2015 }} by Philip Metzger&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that Pluto may have formed as a result of the agglomeration of numerous comets and Kuiper-belt objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP-20180524&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Pluto May Have Formed from 1 Billion Comets |url=https://www.space.com/40687-pluto-formation-1-billion-comets.html |date=May 24, 2018 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=May 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ARX-20180524&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Glein |first1=Christopher R. |last2=Waite Jr |first2=J.

Though Pluto is the largest Kuiper belt object discovered,&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutosize&quot; /&gt; Neptune's moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], which is slightly larger than Pluto, is similar to it both geologically and atmospherically, and is thought to be a captured Kuiper belt object.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetaryOrg Triton&quot; /&gt; Eris ([[#Classification|see above]]) is about the same size as Pluto (though more massive) but is not strictly considered a member of the Kuiper belt population. Rather, it is considered a member of a linked population called the [[scattered disc]].

A large number of Kuiper belt objects, like Pluto, are in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune. KBOs with this orbital resonance are called &quot;[[plutino]]s&quot;, after Pluto.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewitt2004&quot; /&gt;

Like other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is thought to be a residual [[planetesimal]]; a component of the original [[protoplanetary disc]] around the [[Sun]] that failed to fully coalesce into a full-fledged planet. Most astronomers agree that Pluto owes its current position to a [[planetary migration|sudden migration]] undergone by Neptune early in the Solar System's formation. As Neptune migrated outward, it approached the objects in the proto-Kuiper belt, setting one in orbit around itself (Triton), locking others into resonances, and knocking others into chaotic orbits. The objects in the [[scattered disc]], a dynamically unstable region overlapping the Kuiper belt, are thought to have been placed in their current positions by interactions with Neptune's migrating resonances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahn2005&quot; /&gt; A computer model created in 2004 by Alessandro Morbidelli of the [[Côte d'Azur Observatory|Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur]] in [[Nice]] suggested that the migration of Neptune into the Kuiper belt may have been triggered by the formation of a 1:2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn, which created a gravitational push that propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits and caused them to switch places, ultimately doubling Neptune's distance from the Sun. The resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt could also explain the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] 600&amp;nbsp;million years after the Solar System's formation and the origin of the [[Jupiter trojan]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levison2007&quot; /&gt; It is possible that Pluto had a near-circular orbit about 33 AU from the Sun before Neptune's migration [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] it into a resonant capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malhotra1995&quot; /&gt; The [[Nice model]] requires that there were about a thousand Pluto-sized bodies in the original planetesimal disk, which included Triton and Eris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levison2007&quot; /&gt;

== Observation and exploration ==
Pluto's distance from Earth makes its in-depth study and [[Space exploration|exploration]] difficult. On July 14, 2015, NASA's ''[[New Horizons]]'' space probe flew through the Pluto system, providing much information about it.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20160317-sci&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Talbert |first=Tricia |title=Top New Horizons Findings Reported in Science |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/top-new-horizons-findings-reported-in-science |date=March 17, 2016 |work=NASA |accessdate=March 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observation ===
[[File:Pluto animiert 200px.gif|thumb|upright=1|Computer-generated rotating image of Pluto based on observations by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in 2002–2003]]
Pluto's visual [[apparent magnitude]] averages 15.1, brightening to 13.65 at perihelion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pluto Fact Sheet&quot; /&gt; To see it, a telescope is required; around 30&amp;nbsp;cm (12&amp;nbsp;in) aperture being desirable.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSC2002&quot; /&gt; It looks star-like and without a visible disk even in large telescopes, because its [[angular diameter]] is only 0.11&quot;.

The earliest maps of Pluto, made in the late 1980s, were brightness maps created from close observations of eclipses by its largest moon, Charon. Observations were made of the change in the total average brightness of the Pluto–Charon system during the eclipses. For example, eclipsing a bright spot on Pluto makes a bigger total brightness change than eclipsing a dark spot. Computer processing of many such observations can be used to create a brightness map. This method can also track changes in brightness over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;YoungBinzelCrane2001&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BuieTholenHorne1992&quot; /&gt;

Better maps were produced from images taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST), which offered higher [[angular resolution|resolution]], and showed considerably more detail,&lt;ref name=&quot;Buie_web_map&quot; /&gt; resolving variations several hundred kilometers across, including polar regions and large bright spots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buie_2010 surface-maps&quot; /&gt; These maps were produced by complex computer processing, which finds the best-fit projected maps for the few pixels of the Hubble images.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buie_mapmaking&quot; /&gt; These remained the most detailed maps of Pluto until the flyby of ''New Horizons'' in July 2015, because the two cameras on the HST used for these maps were no longer in service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buie_mapmaking&quot; /&gt;

The ''New Horizons'' spacecraft, which [[planetary flyby|flew by]] Pluto in July 2015, is the first and so far only attempt to explore Pluto directly. Launched in 2006, it captured its first (distant) images of Pluto in late September 2006 during a test of the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager.&lt;ref name=&quot;pluto.jhuapl First Pluto Sighting&quot; /&gt; The images, taken from a distance of approximately 4.2&amp;nbsp;billion kilometers, confirmed the spacecraft's ability to track distant targets, critical for maneuvering toward Pluto and other Kuiper belt objects. In early 2007 the craft made use of a [[gravity assist]] from [[Jupiter]].

''New Horizons'' made its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015, after a 3,462-day journey across the Solar System. Scientific observations of Pluto began five months before the closest approach and continued for at least a month after the encounter. Observations were conducted using a [[remote sensing]] package that included [[digital imaging|imaging]] instruments and a radio science investigation tool, as well as [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] and other experiments. The scientific goals of ''New Horizons'' were to characterize the global geology and morphology of Pluto and its moon Charon, map their surface composition, and analyze Pluto's neutral atmosphere and its escape rate.  On October 25, 2016, at 05:48 pm ET, the last bit of data (of a total of 50&amp;nbsp;billion bits of data; or 6.25 gigabytes) was received from ''New Horizons'' from its close encounter with Pluto.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20161028&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=No More Data From Pluto |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/science/pluto-nasa-new-horizons.html |date=October 28, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=October 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since the ''New Horizons'' flyby, scientists have advocated for an orbiter mission that would return to Pluto to fulfill new science objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/26/15424770/nasa-spacecraft-new-horizons-flyby-pluto-moons-orbiter-mission|title=Why a group of scientists think we need another mission to Pluto|work=The Verge|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include mapping the surface at {{cvt|30|ft|m|sigfig=2|order=flip}} per pixel, observations of Pluto's smaller satellites, observations of how Pluto changes as it rotates on its axis, and topographic mapping of Pluto's regions that are covered in long-term darkness due to its axial tilt. The last objective could be accomplished using laser pulses to generate a complete topographic map of Pluto. ''New Horizons'' principal investigator Alan Stern has advocated for a [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'']]-style orbiter that would launch around 2030 (the 100th anniversary of Pluto's discovery) and use Charon's gravity to adjust its orbit as needed to fulfill science objectives after arriving at the Pluto system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/36697-pluto-orbiter-mission-after-new-horizons.html|title=Going Back to Pluto?

=== Sub-Charon hemisphere ===
The equatorial region of the sub-Charon hemisphere of Pluto has only been imaged at low resolution, as ''New Horizons'' made its closest approach to the anti-Charon hemisphere.

=== Southern hemisphere ===
[[File:Pluto map (Hubble).jpg|thumb|upright=1.28|A map of Pluto based on Hubble images, centered on the anti-Charon hemisphere (Sputnik Planitia), covering the southern hemisphere down to 75°S]]
''New Horizons'' imaged all of Pluto's northern hemisphere, and the equatorial regions down to about 30° South. Higher southern latitudes have only been observed, at very low resolution, from Earth. Images from the Hubble Space Telescope in 1996 cover 85% of Pluto and show large albedo features down to about 75° South. This is enough to show the extent of the temperate-zone maculae. Later images had slightly better resolution, due to minor improvements in Hubble instrumentation, but didn't reach quite as far south.

{{efn| name = Perihelion| 1 = The discovery of Charon in 1978 allowed astronomers to accurately calculate the mass of the Plutonian system. But it did not indicate the two bodies' individual masses, which could only be estimated after other moons of Pluto were discovered in late 2005. As a result, because Pluto came to perihelion in 1989, most Pluto perihelion date estimates are based on the Pluto–Charon [[barycenter]].

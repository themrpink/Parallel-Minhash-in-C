==Life after the Olympics==
[[File:Jesse Owens 1971 Ajman stamp.jpg|thumb|upright|Owens on a 1971 [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] stamp]]
Owens was quoted saying the secret behind his success was, &quot;I let my feet spend as little time on the ground as possible. From the air, fast down, and from the ground, fast up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Altman |first=Alex |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1917099,00.html |title=Usain Bolt: The World's Fastest Human |work=TIME |date=August 18, 2009 |access-date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ThinkExist.com Quotations |url=http://thinkexist.com/quotation/i-let-my-feet-spend-as-little-time-on-the-ground/409051.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714143337/http://thinkexist.com/quotation/i-let-my-feet-spend-as-little-time-on-the-ground/409051.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |title=Jesse Owens quotes |publisher=Thinkexist.com |access-date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the games had ended, the entire Olympic team was invited to compete in [[Sweden]]. Owens decided to capitalize on his success by returning to the United States to take up some of the more lucrative endorsement offers. United States athletic officials were furious and withdrew his amateur status, which immediately ended his career. Owens was angry and stated that &quot;A fellow desires something for himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/606/A76754028| title=BBC – An Emperor among Professionals|last=Riley|first=Liam|publisher=BBC |access-date=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owens argued that the [[Racism in the United States|racial discrimination]] he had faced throughout his athletic career, such as not being eligible for scholarships in college and therefore being unable to take classes between training and working to pay his way, meant he had to give up on amateur athletics in pursuit of financial gain elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entine&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Entine|first1=Jon|title=Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and why We are Afraid to Talk about it|url=https://archive.org/details/taboowhyblackath00entirich|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=PublicAffairs|page=[https://archive.org/details/taboowhyblackath00entirich/page/187 187]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens returned home from the 1936 Olympics with four gold medals and international fame, yet had difficulty finding work. He took on menial jobs as a gas station attendant, playground janitor, and manager of a dry cleaning firm. He also raced against amateurs and horses for cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/from-horse-racer-to-speech-writer-jesse-owens-life-after-the-olympic-games|title=From horse-racer to speech writer: Jesse Owens' life after the Olympic Games|date=April 11, 2017|website=olympic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens was prohibited from making appearances at amateur sporting events to bolster his profile, and he found out that the commercial offers had all but disappeared. In 1937, he briefly toured with a twelve-piece jazz band under contract with Consolidated Artists but found it unfulfilling. He also made appearances at baseball games and other events.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Neely, &quot;[http://www.knoxmercury.com/2016/08/10/fastest-bandleader-world/ The Fastest Bandleader in the World],&quot; ''Knoxville Mercury'', August 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Willis Ward]]—a friend and former competitor from the [[University of Michigan]]—brought Owens to [[Detroit]] in 1942 to work at [[Ford Motor Company]] as Assistant Personnel Director. Owens later became a director, in which capacity he worked until 1946.

In 1946, Owens joined [[Abe Saperstein]] in the formation of the [[West Coast Negro Baseball League]], a new [[Negro league baseball|Negro baseball league]]; Owens was Vice-President and the owner of the [[Portland Rosebuds (baseball)|Portland (Oregon) Rosebuds]] franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;oba2005&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/west-coast-baseball-association-tf/ |title=West Coast Baseball Association |encyclopedia=Organizing Black America: An Encyclopedia of African American Associations |date=February 10, 2005 |publisher=[[BookRags]] |access-date=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920063619/http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/west-coast-baseball-association-tf |archive-date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He toured with the Rosebuds, sometimes entertaining the audience in between [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader games]] by competing in races against horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;elpaso2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Sun City home to the Negro Leagues for one weekend | url= http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_15493851 | first= Milan | last= Simonich | date= July 12, 2010 | publisher= [[El Paso Times]] | work= Hidden El Paso | access-date= July 31, 2010 | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://archive.is/20130208044418/http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_15493851 | archive-date= February 8, 2013 | df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WCBA disbanded after only two months.&lt;ref name=&quot;oba2005&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;elpaso2010&quot; /&gt;

Owens helped promote the [[exploitation film]] ''[[Mom and Dad]]'' in African American neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/27355|title=Mom and Dad (1945)|website=American Film Institute|access-date=June 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to make a living as a sports promoter, essentially an entertainer. He would give local sprinters a ten- or twenty-yard start and beat them in the 100-yd (91-m) dash. He also challenged and defeated racehorses; as he revealed later, the trick was to race a high-strung [[Thoroughbred]] that would be frightened by the starter's shotgun and give him a bad jump. Owens said, &quot;People say that it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse, but what was I supposed to do? I had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;espn1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016393.html| title=Owens Pierced a Myth|last=Schwartz|first=Larry| publisher=ESPN|access-date=April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the lack of opportunities, Owens added, &quot;There was no television, no big advertising, no endorsements then. Not for a black man, anyway.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Entine&quot; /&gt;

He traveled to [[Rome]] for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] where he met the 1960 100 meters champion [[Armin Hary]] of Germany, who had defeated American [[Dave Sime]] in a photo finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/athletics-legend-jesse-owens-poses-and-jokes-with-his-news-photo/516803630#athletics-legend-jesse-owens-poses-and-jokes-with-his-fellow-armin-picture-id516803630|title=US athletics legend Jesse Owens (R) poses and jokes with his f ...|access-date=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Owens was hired as a running instructor for spring training for the [[New York Mets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.who2.com/jesse-owens-was-briefly-really-a-coach-for-the-mets/|title=Jesse Owens Was (Briefly) (Really!) a Coach for the Mets&amp;nbsp;— Who2|website=who2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens ran a [[dry cleaning]] business and worked as a gas station attendant to earn a living, but he eventually filed for [[bankruptcy]]. In 1966, he was successfully prosecuted for [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jesse Owens Is Fined in Tax Case|work=The Times-News|agency=United Press International|date=February 2, 1966|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-vIZAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2316,2150242|access-date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At rock bottom, he was aided in beginning his rehabilitation. The government appointed him as a US [[goodwill ambassador]]. Owens traveled the world and spoke to companies such as the [[Ford Motor Company]] and stakeholders such as the [[United States Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Jesse Owens|url=https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/sporting-heroes/jesse-owens/|access-date=2020-08-10|website=Black History Month 2020|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he retired, he owned racehorses.

Owens initially refused to support the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|black power salute]] by [[African-American]] sprinters [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]. He told them:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesseowens.com/quotes/|title=Jesse Owens: Olympic Legend-quotes|access-date=May 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The black fist is a meaningless symbol. When you open it, you have nothing but fingers – weak, empty fingers. The only time the black fist has significance is when there's money inside. There's where the power lies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Four years later in his 1972 book ''I Have Changed'', he revised his opinion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I realized now that militancy in the best sense of the word was the only answer where the black man was concerned, that any black man who wasn't a militant in 1970 was either blind or a coward.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Owens traveled to [[Munich]] for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] as a special guest of the West German government,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-aug-08-1972-jesse-owens-at-the-olympic-games-in-munich-world-famous-69467677.html?pv=1&amp;stamp=2&amp;imageid=C6CC95AC-6A8C-4AEE-9181-4BC5D0F4AA24&amp;p=90011&amp;n=0&amp;orientation=0&amp;pn=1&amp;searchtype=0&amp;IsFromSearch=1&amp;srch=foo%3dbar%26st%3d0%26pn%3d1%26ps%3d100%26sortby%3d2%26resultview%3dsortbyPopular%26npgs%3d0%26qt%3dolympic%2520games%2520berlin%25201936%26qt_raw%3dolympic%2520games%2520berlin%25201936%26lic%3d3%26mr%3d0%26pr%3d0%26ot%3d0%26creative%3d%26ag%3d0%26hc%3d0%26pc%3d%26blackwhite%3d%26cutout%3d%26tbar%3d1%26et%3d0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3d0%26loc%3d0%26imgt%3d0%26dtfr%3d%26dtto%3d%26size%3d0xFF%26archive%3d1%26groupid%3d%26pseudoid%3d%26a%3d%26cdid%3d%26cdsrt%3d%26name%3d%26qn%3d%26apalib%3d0%26apalic%3d%26lightbox%3d%26gname%3d%26gtype%3d%26xstx%3d0%26simid%3d%26saveQry%3d%26editorial%3d1%26nu%3d%26t%3d%26edoptin%3d%26customgeoip%3d%26cap%3d1%26cbstore%3d1%26vd%3d0%26lb%3d%26fi%3d2|title=Stock Photo&amp;nbsp;— Aug. 08, 1972&amp;nbsp;— Jesse Owens at the Olympic games in Munich.: World famous American coloured athlete Jesse Owens.

A few months before his death, Owens had unsuccessfully tried to convince [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] to withdraw his demand that the United States [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics]] in protest of the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. He argued that the Olympic ideal was supposed to be observed as a time-out from war and that it was above politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/04/01/jesse-owens/fcc3d038-d015-4f2e-ab36-75867ae859f9/|title=Jesse Owens&amp;nbsp;— Obituary|date=April 1, 1980|work=The Washington Post|access-date=June 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Owens was a pack-a-day [[Tobacco smoking|cigarette smoker]] for 35 years, starting at age 32.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Murry R. Nelson|title=American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas &amp;#91;4 Volumes&amp;#93;: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfTXAQAAQBAJ&amp;q=jesse+owens+started+smoking+32&amp;pg=PA987|date=May 23, 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-39753-0|page=987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in December 1979, he was hospitalized on and off with an extremely aggressive and [[drug-resistant]] type of [[lung cancer]]. He died of the disease at age 66 in [[Tucson, Arizona]], on March 31, 1980, with his wife and other family members at his bedside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0912.html |title=Jesse Owens Dies Of Cancer At 66: Hero of the 1936 Berlin Olympics |work=The New York Times |date=April 1, 1980 |access-date=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Oak Woods Cemetery]] in [[Chicago]]. Although Jimmy Carter had ignored Owens' request to cancel the Olympic boycott, the president issued a tribute to Owens after he died: &quot;Perhaps no athlete better symbolized the human struggle against tyranny, poverty and racial bigotry.&quot;

==Legacy==
The dormitory that Owens occupied during the Berlin Olympics has been fully restored into a living museum, with pictures of his accomplishments at the games, and a letter (intercepted by the Gestapo) from a fan urging him not to shake hands with Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hitler%E2%80%99s_Olympic_Village_Faces_Conservation_Battle.theora.ogv|title=Hitler's Olympic Village Faces Conservation Battle |work=Voice of America|date=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fertilisation''' or '''fertilization''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|spelling differences]]), also known as '''generative fertilisation''', '''insemination''', '''pollination''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fertilization |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fertilization |website=Merriam-Webster |access-date=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''fecundation''', '''syngamy''' and '''impregnation''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/impregnation{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the fusion of [[gametes]] to give rise to a new individual organism or offspring and initiate its development. This cycle of fertilisation and development of new individuals is called [[sexual reproduction]]. During [[double fertilisation]] in [[angiosperms]] the [[haploid]] male gamete combines with two haploid [[polar nuclei]] to      form a [[triploid]] primary [[endosperm]] nucleus by the process of vegetative fertilisation.

==History==
In Antiquity, [[Aristotle]] conceived the formation of new individuals through fusion of male and female fluids, with form and function emerging gradually, in a mode called by him as [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenetic]].&lt;ref name=Maienschein&gt;Maienschein J. 2017. The first century of cell theory: From structural units to complex living systems. In: Stadler F. (eds.), ''Integrated History and Philosophy of Science. Vienna Circle Institute Yearbook''. Institute Vienna Circle, University of Vienna, Vienna Circle Society, Society for the Advancement of Scientific World Conceptions, vol 20. Springer, Cham. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zRgnDwAAQBAJ link].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1784, [[Spallanzani]] established the need of interaction between the female's ovum and male's sperm to form a zygote in frogs.&lt;ref name=Birkhead/&gt; In 1827, von Baer observed a [[Theria|therian]] mammalian egg for the first time.&lt;ref name=Maienschein/&gt; [[Oscar Hertwig]] (1876), in Germany, described the fusion of nuclei of spermatozoa and of ova from [[sea urchin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birkhead&quot;&gt;Birkhead, T.R. &amp; Montgomerie, R. (2009). Three centuries of sperm research, pp 1-42 in: Birkhead, T. R., Hosken, D. J. &amp; Pitnick, S. ''Sperm Biology: An Evolutionary Perspective''. Elsevier/Academic Press, Amsterdam. 642 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=kctYNbO1fE0C].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The evolution of fertilisation is related to the [[Origin and function of meiosis|origin of meiosis]], as both are part of [[sexual reproduction]], originated in [[eukaryote]]s. There are two conflicting theories on how the couple meiosis–fertilisation arose. One is that it evolved from prokaryotic sex ([[bacterial recombination]]) as eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  The other is that [[mitosis]] originated meiosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkins_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkins AS, Holliday R | title = The evolution of meiosis from mitosis | journal = Genetics | volume = 181 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19139151 | pmc = 2621177 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.108.099762 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fertilisation in plants==
[[File:DEV035048A.jpg|thumb|In the [[Bryophyte]] land plants, fertilisation takes place within the [[archegonium]]. This [[moss]] has been [[GUS reporter system|genetically modified]] so that the unfertilised egg within the archegonium produces a blue colour.]]

The gametes that participate in fertilisation of plants are the pollen (male), and the egg (female) cell.  Various families of plants have differing methods by which the female gametophyte is fertilised.  In [[Bryophyte]] land plants, fertilisation takes place within the [[archegonium]].  In [[flowering plant]]s a second fertilisation event involves another sperm cell and the [[central cell]] which is a second female gamete. In flowering plants there are two sperm from each pollen grain.

In [[seed plant]]s, after [[pollination]], a [[pollen]] grain [[Pollen germination|germinates]], and a [[pollen tube]] grows and penetrates the [[ovule]] through a tiny pore called a [[Ovule|micropyle]].The sperm are transferred from the pollen through the pollen tube to the ovule.

'''Pollen tube growth'''

Unlike animal sperm which is motile, plant sperm is immotile and relies on the pollen tube to carry it to the ovule where the sperm is released.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms4129 |pmid=24451849 |title=Reactive oxygen species mediate pollen tube rupture to release sperm for fertilization in Arabidopsis |journal=Nature Communications |volume=5 |pages=3129 |year=2014 |last1=Duan |first1=Qiaohong |last2=Kita |first2=Daniel |last3=Johnson |first3=Eric A |last4=Aggarwal |first4=Mini |last5=Gates |first5=Laura |last6=Wu |first6=Hen-Ming |last7=Cheung |first7=Alice Y |bibcode=2014NatCo...5.3129D |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pollen tube penetrates the [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] and elongates through the extracellular matrix of the style before reaching the ovary.  Then near the receptacle, it breaks through the [[ovule]] through the micropyle (an opening in the ovule wall) and the pollen tube &quot;bursts&quot; into the embryo sac, releasing sperm.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90427-1 |pmid=7634328 |title=A floral transmitting tissue-specific glycoprotein attracts pollen tubes and stimulates their growth |journal=Cell |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=383–93 |year=1995 |last1=Cheung |first1=Alice Y |last2=Wang |first2=Hong |last3=Wu |first3=Hen-Ming |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of the pollen tube has been believed to depend on chemical cues from the pistil, however these mechanisms were poorly understood until 1995.  Work done on [[Nicotiana|tobacco plants]] revealed a family of [[glycoprotein]]s called TTS proteins that enhanced growth of pollen tubes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;  Pollen tubes in a sugar free pollen germination medium and a medium with purified TTS proteins both grew.  However, in the TTS medium, the tubes grew at a rate 3x that of the sugar-free medium.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;  TTS proteins were also placed on various locations of semi [[In vivo|in vevo]] pollinated pistils, and pollen tubes were observed to immediately extend toward the proteins.  Transgenic plants lacking the ability to produce TTS proteins exhibited slower pollen tube growth and reduced fertility.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

'''Rupture of pollen tube'''

The rupture of the pollen tube to release sperm in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' has been shown to depend on a signal from the female gametophyte.  Specific proteins called FER protein kinases present in the ovule control the production of highly reactive derivatives of oxygen called [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS). ROS levels have been shown via [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] to be at their highest during floral stages when the ovule is the most receptive to pollen tubes, and lowest during times of development and following fertilisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;    High amounts of ROS activate Calcium ion channels in the pollen tube, causing these channels to take up Calcium ions in large amounts. This increased uptake of calcium causes the pollen tube to rupture, and release its sperm into the ovule.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  Pistil feeding assays in which plants were fed diphenyl iodonium chloride (DPI) suppressed ROS concentrations in ''Arabidopsis'', which in turn prevented pollen tube rupture.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Bryophytes===
Bryophyte is a traditional name used to refer to all embryophytes (land plants) that do not have true vascular tissue and are therefore called &quot;non-vascular plants&quot;. Some bryophytes do have specialised tissues for the transport of water; however, since these do not contain lignin, they are not considered true vascular tissue.

===Ferns===
A fern is a member of a group of roughly 12,000 species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular (i.e. having water-conducting vessels). They have stems and leaves, like other vascular plants. Most ferns have what are called fiddleheads that expand into fronds, which are each delicately divided.

===Gymnosperms===
The gymnosperms are a group of seed producing plants that includes conifers, [[Cycad]]s, [[Ginkgo]], and [[Gnetales]]. The term &quot;gymnosperm&quot; comes from the Greek composite word γυμνόσπερμος (γυμνός gymnos, &quot;naked&quot; and σπέρμα sperma, &quot;seed&quot;), meaning &quot;naked seeds&quot;, after the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilised state). Their naked condition stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, often modified to form cones, or at the end of short stalks as in Ginkgo.

===Flowering plants===
{{main|Double fertilisation}}

After being fertilised, the ovary starts to swell and develop into the [[fruit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;facts_and_practice_for_a_level&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnstone |first1=Adam |title=Biology: facts &amp; practice for A level |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-914766-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/biologyfactsprac0000john/page/95 95] |year=2001 |url=https://archive.org/details/biologyfactsprac0000john/page/95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With multi-seeded fruits, multiple grains of pollen are necessary for syngamy with each ovule.  The growth of the pollen tube is controlled by the vegetative (or tube) cytoplasm. Hydrolytic [[enzymes]] are secreted by the pollen tube that digest the female tissue as the tube grows down the stigma and style; the digested tissue is used as a nutrient source for the pollen tube as it grows. During pollen tube growth towards the ovary, the generative nucleus divides to produce two separate sperm nuclei (haploid number of chromosomes)&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook_of_plant_science&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of plant science |year=2007 |publisher=John Wiley |location=Chichester, West Sussex, England |isbn=978-0-470-05723-0 |page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a growing pollen tube therefore contains three separate nuclei, two sperm and one tube.&lt;ref name=&quot;biology_today_a01&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirk |first1=David |last2=Starr |first2=Cecie |title=Biology today |year=1975 |publisher=CRM |location=Del Mar, Calif. |isbn=978-0-394-31093-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/biologytoday00kirk/page/93 93] |url=https://archive.org/details/biologytoday00kirk |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sperms are interconnected and dimorphic, the large one, in a number of plants, is also linked to the tube nucleus and the interconnected sperm and the tube nucleus form the &quot;male germ unit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raghavan |first1=Valayamghat |title=Double fertilization: embryo and endosperm development in flowering plant |url=https://archive.org/details/fertilizationhig00ragh |url-access=limited |year=2006 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-540-27791-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fertilizationhig00ragh/page/n235 12]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Double fertilization|Double fertilisation]] is the process in [[angiosperms]] (flowering plants) in which two [[sperm]] from each pollen tube fertilise two [[cell (biology)|cells]] in a female [[gametophyte]] (sometimes called an embryo sac) that is inside an ovule. After the pollen tube enters the gametophyte, the pollen tube nucleus disintegrates and the two sperm cells are released; one of the two sperm cells ''fertilises'' the egg cell (at the bottom of the gametophyte near the micropyle), forming a [[diploid]] (2n) [[zygote]]. This is the point when fertilisation actually occurs; pollination and fertilisation are two separate processes. The nucleus of the other sperm cell fuses with two haploid polar nuclei (contained in the central cell) in the centre of the gametophyte. The resulting cell is [[triploid]] (3n). This triploid cell divides through [[mitosis]] and forms the [[endosperm]], a [[nutrient]]-rich [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], inside the [[seed]].

The two central-cell maternal nuclei (polar nuclei) that contribute to the endosperm arise by mitosis from the single meiotic product that also gave rise to the egg. Therefore, maternal contribution to the genetic constitution of the triploid endosperm is double that of the embryo.

One primitive species of flowering plant, ''[[Nuphar|Nuphar polysepala]]'', has endosperm that is diploid, resulting from the fusion of a sperm with one, rather than two, maternal nuclei. It is believed that early in the development of angiosperm linages, there was a duplication in this mode of reproduction, producing seven-celled/eight-nucleate female gametophytes, and triploid endosperms with a 2:1 maternal to paternal genome ratio.&lt;ref name=Friedman2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00257.x |pmid=12683519 |title=Modularity of the Angiosperm Female Gametophyte and Its Bearing on the Early Evolution of Endosperm in Flowering Plants |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=216–30 |year=2003 |last1=Friedman |first1=William E |last2=Williams |first2=Joseph H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many plants, the development of the flesh of the fruit is proportional to the percentage of fertilised ovules. For example, with [[watermelon]], about a thousand grains of pollen must be delivered and spread evenly on the three lobes of the stigma to make a normal sized and shaped fruit.

Cross-fertilisation and self-fertilisation represent different strategies with differing benefits and costs.  An estimated 48.7% of plant species are either dioecious or self-incompatible obligate out-crossers.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16817548&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Igic B, Kohn JR |title=The distribution of plant mating systems: study bias against obligately outcrossing species |journal=Evolution |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=1098–103 |year=2006 |pmid=16817548 |doi= 10.1554/05-383.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also estimated that about 42% of flowering plants exhibit a mixed mating system in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodwillie C, Kalisz S, Eckert CG | s2cid = 3755371 | year = 2005 | title = The evolutionary enigma of mixed mating systems in plants: Occurrence, theoretical explanations, and empirical evidence | journal = Annu.

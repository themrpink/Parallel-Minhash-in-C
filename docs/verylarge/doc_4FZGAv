Handlers of [[working animal]]s generally find mules preferable to horses: mules show more patience under the pressure of heavy weights, and their skin is harder and less sensitive than that of horses, rendering them more capable of resisting sun and rain.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Mule|volume=18|pages=959–960|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their hooves are harder than horses', and they show a natural resistance to disease and insects. Many North American farmers with [[clay]] soil found mules superior as plow animals.

A mule does not sound exactly like a donkey or a horse. Instead, a mule makes a sound that is similar to a donkey's but also has the whinnying characteristics of a horse (often starts with a whinny, ends in a hee-haw). Mules sometimes whimper.{{clear left}}

===Color and size variety===
[[File:Mules leisurely enjoying the sun and the snow.jpg|thumb|Mules come in a variety of colors and sizes; these mules had a draft horse mare for a mother]]
[[File:Mule Battery WDL11495 crop.png|thumb|A mule battery in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] (1879–1880). [[Sepoy]]s are sitting by the larger field guns.]]

Mules come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colors, from minis under {{convert|200|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} to over {{convert|1000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, and in many different colors. The coats of mules come in the same varieties as those of horses. Common colors are [[sorrel (horse)|sorrel]], [[bay (horse)|bay]], [[black (horse)|black]], and [[gray (horse)|grey]]. Less common are [[white (horse)|white]], [[roan (horse)|roans]], [[palomino]], [[dun gene|dun]], and [[buckskin (horse)|buckskin]]. Least common are [[pinto horse|paint]] mules or [[tobiano]]s. Mules from [[Appaloosa]] mares produce wildly colored mules, much like their Appaloosa horse relatives, but with even wilder skewed colors.  The Appaloosa color is produced by a complex of genes known as the [[Leopard complex]] (Lp). Mares homozygous for the Lp gene bred to any color donkey will produce a spotted mule.

===Distribution and use===
Mules historically were used by armies to transport supplies, occasionally as mobile firing platforms for smaller cannons, and to pull heavier field guns with wheels over mountainous trails such as in Afghanistan during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Caption of ''Mule Battery WDL11495.png'' Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) reports that [[China]] was the top market for mules in 2003, closely followed by [[Mexico]] and many [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]n nations.

==Fertility==
Mules and hinnies have 63 [[chromosome]]s, a mixture of the horse's 64 and the donkey's 62. The different structure and number usually prevents the chromosomes from pairing up properly and creating successful embryos, rendering most mules [[infertile]].

A few mare mules have produced offspring when mated with a purebred horse or donkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savory | first1 = Theodore H | year = 1970 | title = The Mule | journal = Scientific American | volume = 223 | issue = 6| pages = 102–109 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1270-102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kay2002&gt;{{cite news |last=Kay |first=Katty |date=2002-10-02 |title=Morocco's miracle mule |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2290491.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] gives an account of such an event as an ill omen of [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|Xerxes' invasion of Greece]] in 480 BC: &quot;There happened also a portent of another kind while he was still at Sardis—a mule brought forth young and gave birth to a mule&quot; (Herodotus ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' 7:57), and a mule's giving birth was a frequently recorded portent in antiquity, although scientific writers also doubted whether the thing was really possible (see e.g. [[Aristotle]], ''Historia animalium'', 6.24; [[Varro]], ''De re rustica'', 2.1.28).

A 1939 article in the ''Journal of Heredity'' describes two offspring of a fertile mare mule named &quot;Old Bec&quot;, which was owned at the time by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in the late 1920s. One of the foals was a female, sired by a jack. Unlike her mother, she was sterile. The other, sired by a five-gaited [[American Saddlebred|Saddlebred]] stallion, exhibited no characteristics of any donkey. That horse, a stallion, was bred to several mares, which gave birth to live foals that showed no characteristics of the donkey.&lt;ref name=JHeredity-30-12&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=W.

== Modern usage ==
[[File:Frecklesmule.jpg|thumb|A spotted mule]]
In the second half of the 20th century, widespread usage of mules declined in industrialized countries. The use of mules for farming and transportation of agricultural products largely gave way to steam then gasoline powered [[tractors]] and [[truck]]s.

Mules are still used extensively to transport cargo in rugged roadless regions, such as the large [[wilderness]] areas of California's [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains or the [[Pasayten Wilderness]] of northern Washington state. Commercial pack mules are used recreationally, such as to supply mountaineering base camps, and also to supply trail building and maintenance crews, and backcountry footbridge building crews.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Louise A (2004). ''The Mule Men: A History of Stock Packing in the Sierra Nevada''. Missoula, MT: Mountain Press. {{ISBN|0-87842-499-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2014, there are at least sixteen commercial mule [[pack station]]s in business in the Sierra Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009-01-18 |title=Members of the Eastern Sierra Packers |url=http://www.easternsierrapackers.com/members.htm |website=easternsierrapackers.com |publisher=Eastern Sierra Packers |access-date=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Angeles chapter of the [[Sierra Club]] has a Mule Pack Section that organizes hiking trips with supplies carried by mules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014-04-18 |title=Mule Pack Section, Angeles Chapter, Sierra Club |url=http://angeles.sierraclub.org/mps/ |website=angeles.sierraclub.org |publisher=Angeles Chapter Sierra Club |access-date=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], mules were used to carry weapons and supplies over Afghanistan's rugged terrain to the [[mujahideen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Bearden|Bearden, Milt]] (2003) ''The Main Enemy, The Inside story of the CIA's Final showdown with the KGB''.

[[File:The Second Anglo - Boer War, South Africa 1899 - 1902 Q72044.jpg|thumb|A British mule train during the Second Anglo-Boer War, South Africa]]
[[File:Mule packing.png|thumb|left|Loading mules during exploration of the American West, from [[Frances Fuller Victor]]'s 1887 book ''[[wikisource:Eleven years in the Rocky Mountains and a life on the frontier|Eleven Years in the Rocky Mountains and a Life on the Frontier]]''.]]

A '''mule train''' is a connected or unconnected line of '''pack mules''', usually carrying cargo. Because of the mule's ability to carry at least as much as a horse, their trait of being sure-footed along with their tolerance of poorer coarser foods and abilities to tolerate arid terrains, mule trains were common caravan organized means of [[animal power]]ed [[bulk transport]] back into pre-classical times. In many climate and circumstantial instances, an equivalent string of pack horses would have to carry more fodder and sacks of high energy grains such as [[oat]]s, so could carry less cargo. In modern times, strings of sure footed mules have been used to carry riders in dangerous but scenic back country terrain such as excursions into canyons.

Pack trains were instrumental in opening up the American West as the sure footed animals could carry up to {{convert|250|lb}}, survive on rough forage,{{efn |''Rough forage'' means mules, donkeys, and other asses, like many wild ungulates such as various deer species, can tolerate eating small shrubs, lichens and some branch-laden tree foliages and obtaining nutrition from such. In contrast, the digestive system of horses and to a lesser extent cattle are more dependent upon grasses, and evolved in climates where grasslands involved stands of grains and their high energy seed heads.}} did not require feed, and could operate in the arid higher elevations of the Rockies, serving as the main cargo means to the west from Missouri during the heyday of the [[North American fur trade]]. Their use antedated the move west into the Rockies as colonial Americans sent out the first fur trappers and explorers past the Appalachians who were then followed west by high-risk-taking settlers by the 1750s (such as [[Daniel Boone]]) who led an increasing flood of emigrants that began pushing west over into southern New York, and through the [[gaps of the Allegheny]] into the [[Ohio Country]] (the lands of western [[colony of Virginia|Province of Virginia]] and the [[Province of Pennsylvania]]), into Tennessee and Kentucky before and especially after the [[American Revolution]].

In the nineteenth century, [[twenty-mule team]]s, for instance, were teams of eighteen mules and two horses attached to large wagons that ferried [[borax]] out of [[Death Valley]] from 1883 to 1889. The wagons were among the largest ever pulled by draft animals, designed to carry 10 [[short ton]]s (9 metric tons) of borax ore at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mules hauling a 22,000lb boiler|url=https://www.tsl.texas.gov/exhibits/railroad/beginnings/muletrain.html|publisher=Texas State Library and Archives Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clone ==
In 2003, researchers at [[University of Idaho]] and [[Utah State University]] produced the first mule [[cloning|clone]] as part of [[Project Idaho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Project Idaho |url=http://www.uidaho.edu/cloning |publisher=[[University of Idaho]] |date=2003-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809144746/http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/cloning |archive-date=2009-08-09 |access-date=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research team included Gordon Woods, professor of [[animal science|animal]] and [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary science]] at the University of Idaho; Kenneth L. White, Utah State University professor of animal science; and Dirk Vanderwall, University of Idaho assistant professor of animal and veterinary science. The baby mule, [[Idaho Gem]], was born May 4. It was the first clone of a hybrid animal. Veterinary examinations of the foal and its surrogate mother showed them to be in good health soon after birth. The foal's DNA comes from a fetal cell culture first established in 1998 at the University of Idaho.

The '''kilometre''' ([[SI]] symbol: '''km'''; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|ə|m|iː|t|ər}} or {{IPAc-en|k|ɪ|ˈ|l|ɒ|m|ɪ|t|ər}}), spelt '''kilometer''' in [[American English]], is a [[unit of length]] in the [[metric system]], equal to one thousand [[metre]]s ([[kilo-]] being the [[SI prefix]] for {{val|1000}}). It is now the measurement unit used for expressing distances between geographical places on land in most of the world; notable exceptions are the United States and the United Kingdom where the [[statute mile]] is the unit used.

The abbreviations '''k''' or '''K''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|eɪ}}) are commonly used to represent kilometre, but are not recommended by the [[BIPM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/kilometre?q=kilometre |title=Kilometre |website=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries |access-date=1 November 2019}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The International System of Units (SI) |url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si-brochure/SI-Brochure-9-EN.pdf#page=33 |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) |access-date=8 January 2020 |pages=147-149 |date=2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slang term for the kilometre in the US and UK militaries is ''[[wikt:klick#Etymology 1|klick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MARINE CORPS JARGON |url=http://www.hqmc.marines.mil/Portals/143/Docs/Onboarding/Marine%20jargon.pdf |publisher=hqmc.marines.mil |access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/theorderlyroom/f/faqklickdef.htm |title=How Far is a 'Klick' in the Military? |author=Rod Powers |publisher=[[About.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217151419/http://usmilitary.about.com/od/theorderlyroom/f/faqklickdef.htm |archive-date=17 February 2006 |access-date=13 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former follows a pattern in English whereby metric units are pronounced with the stress on the first syllable (as in [[kilogram]], [[kilojoule]] and [[kilohertz]]) and the pronunciation of the actual base unit does not change irrespective of the prefix (as in [[centimetre]], [[millimetre]], [[nanometre]] and so on). It is generally preferred by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Many scientists and other users, particularly in countries where the metric system is not widely used, use the pronunciation with stress on the second syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3586220.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Correct pronunciation on the radio | first=Roland | last=White | date=23 March 2008 |access-date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kilometer |title=Kilometer - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |access-date=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter pronunciation follows the stress pattern used for the names of measuring instruments (such as ''micrometer'', ''barometer'', ''thermometer'', ''tachometer'' and ''speedometer''). The contrast is even more obvious in countries using the Commonwealth spelling rather than American spelling of the word ''metre''.

When Australia introduced the metric system in 1975, the first pronunciation was declared official by the government's Metric Conversion Board. However, the Australian prime minister at the time, [[Gough Whitlam]], insisted that the second pronunciation was the correct one because of the Greek origins of the two parts of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~doswell/peeves/Discussions.html |title=damage lessons |publisher=Cimms.ou.edu |access-date=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Division of the meridien.PNG|thumb|480px|right|Historical divisions of the meridian in France]]
By a decree of 8 May 1790, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent assembly]] ordered the [[French Academy of Sciences]] to develop a new measurement system. In August 1793, the French [[National Convention]] decreed the [[metre]] as the sole length measurement system in the French Republic. The first name of the kilometre was &quot;Millaire&quot;.
Although the metre was formally defined in 1799, the [[myriametre]] ({{val|10000}}&amp;nbsp;metres) was preferred to the &quot;kilometre&quot; for everyday use. The term &quot;''myriamètre''&quot; appeared a number of times in the text of Develey's book ''Physique d'Emile: ou, Principes de la science de la nature'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

French maps published in 1835 had scales showing ''myriametres'' and &quot;''lieues de Poste''&quot; (Postal leagues of about {{val|4288}}&amp;nbsp;metres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map

The Dutch, on the other hand, adopted the kilometre in 1817 but gave it the local name of the ''mijl''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1935, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) officially abolished the prefix &quot;myria-&quot; and with it the &quot;myriametre&quot;, leaving the kilometre as the recognised unit of length for measurements of that magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Kilometre records==
Some sporting disciplines feature {{val|1000|u=m}} (one-kilometre) races in major events (such as the [[Olympic Games]]).  In some disciplines—although world records are catalogued—one-kilometre events remain a minority.

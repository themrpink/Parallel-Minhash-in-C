The sheep-herder, a man of humble condition, directs his words to the moon in a polite but insistent tone, seething with melancholy. It is precisely the absence of response on the part of the celestial orb which provokes him to continue to investigate, ever more profoundly, into the role of the moon, and therefore into that of humanity, with respect to life and the world, defining ever more sharply the &quot;arid truth&quot; so dear to the poetry of Leopardi. In the first strophe, in fact, the sheep-herder, even while defining the moon as silent, actually expects a response from it and discovers many analogies between his own condition and that of the moon: both of them arise in the morning, follow their always self-identical paths and finally stop to rest. The life of the moon, as much as that of the sheep-herder, seems completely senseless. There appears, however, in the middle of this strophe, a very important distinction: the course of human life is finite and its passage, similar to that of a &quot;vecchierel bianco&quot; (Petrarch, ''Canzoniere'', XVI), terminates tragically in the &quot;horrid abyss&quot; of death. Such a condition, which is defined in the second strophe as a condition of profound suffering (&quot;se la vita è sventura, perché da noi si dura?&quot;) is extremely different from that of the Moon, which seems instead to be eternal, &quot;virgin&quot;, and &quot;intact&quot;.

In the third strophe, the sheep-herder turns again to the moon with renewed vigor and hope, believing that the orb, precisely because of this privileged extra-worldly condition, can provide him the answers to his most urgent questions: what is life? What could possibly be its purpose since it is necessarily finite? What is the first cause of all being? But the moon, as the sheep-herder learns quickly, cannot provide the answers to these questions even if it knew them, since such is nature: distant, incomprehensible, mute if not indifferent to the concerns of man. The sheep-herder's search for sense and happiness continues all the way to the final two strophes. In the fourth, the sheep-herder turns to his flock, observing how the lack of self-awareness that each sheep has allows it to live out, in apparent tranquillity, its brief existence, without suffering or boredom. But this idea is ultimately rejected by the sheep-herder himself in the final strophe, in which he admits that, probably, in whatever form life is born and manifests itself, whether moon, sheep or man, whatever it is capable of doing, life is equally bleak and tragic.

In this period, Leopardi's relations with his family are reduced to a minimum and he is constrained to maintain himself on his own financially. In 1830, after sixteen months of &quot;notte orribile&quot; (awful night), he accepted a generous offer from his Tuscan friends, which enabled him to leave Recanati.

===The last ''Canti'' (1832–1837)===
In the last ''canti'', philosophical investigation predominates, with the exception of ''Tramonto della Luna'' (&quot;Decline of the Moon&quot;) which is a decisive return to idyllic lyricism.

====''Il pensiero dominante''====
In 1831, Leopardi wrote ''Il pensiero dominante'' (&quot;The Dominating Thought&quot;), which exalts love as a living or vitalizing force in itself, even when it is unrequited. The poem, however, features only the desire for love without the joy and the vitalizing spirit and, therefore, remaining thought, illusion. Leopardi destroys everything, condemns everything, but wishes to save love from the universal miasma and protect it at least within the profundity of his own soul. The more desolate the solitude which surrounds him, the more tightly he grasps onto love as the faith in his idealized, illusory, eternal woman (&quot;sua donna&quot;) who placates suffering, disillusion and bitterness. The poet of universal suffering sings of a good which surpasses the ills of life and, for an instant, seems to become the singer of a possible happiness. But the idea of death as the only hope for man returns, since the world offers only two beautiful things: love and death.

''Il pensiero dominante'' represents the first ecstatic moment of love, which almost nullifies the awareness of human unhappiness. It is worth the price of tolerating the suffering of a long life in order to experience the joy of such beauty. ''Il pensiero dominante'' and ''Il risorgimento'' are the only poems of joy written by Leopardi, though even in those two poems there always reappears, inextinguishable, the pessimism which sees in the object of joy a vain image created by the imagination.

====''Amore e Morte''====
The concept of the love-death duality is taken up again in the 1832 canto ''Amore e Morte'' (&quot;Love and Death&quot;). It is a meditation on the torment and annihilation which accompanies love. Love and death, in fact, are twins: the one is the generator of all things beautiful and the other puts an end to all ills. Love makes strong and cancels the fear of death and when it dominates the soul, it makes it desire death. Some, who are won over by passion, will die for it happily. Others kill themselves because of the wounds of love. But happiness consists in dying in the drunkenness of passion. Of the two twins, Leopardi dares to invoke only death, which is no longer symbolized by the horrid Ade of Saffo, but by a young virgin who grants peace for eternity. Death is the sister of love and is the great consoler who, along with her brother, is the best that the world can offer.

====''Consalvo''====
[[File:Fanny Targioni Tozzetti.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Targioni Tozzetti]]
Also in 1832, inspired by a 17th-century poem by [[Girolamo Graziani]] titled [[Il_Conquisto_di_Granata|''La conquista di Granada'']] (&quot;The Capture of [[Granada]]&quot;), Leopardi wrote ''Consalvo''. Consalvo obtains a kiss from the woman he has long loved unrequitedly only when, gravely injured, he is at the point of death. Consalvo is different from the other canti in that it has the form of a novella in verse or of a dramatic scene. It is the fruit of the sentimental and languid literature which characterized much of the romanticism outside of Italy.

====''Aspasia''====
Written in 1834, ''Aspasia'' emerges, like ''Consalvo'', from the painful experience of desperate and unrequited love for Fanny Targioni Tozzetti. Aspasia-Fanny is the only real woman represented in the poetry of Leopardi. Aspasia is the able manipulator whose perfect body hides a corrupt and prosaic soul. She is the demonstration that beauty is dishonest.

The poet, vainly searching for love, takes his revenge on destiny and the women who have rejected him, above all Targioni, whose memory continues to disturb the poet after more than a year away from her. The memory of the woman loved in vain constantly returns, but the canto, inspired by disdain for the provocative and, simultaneously, distancing behavior of the woman also expresses resignation to one's fate and the pride of having been able to recover one's own independence. Aspasia, in her limitedness as a woman cannot grasp the profundity of masculine thought.

====''A se stesso''====
&quot;A se stesso&quot; (To himself) is an 1833 canto in which Leopardi talks to his heart. The last deceit, love, is dead too. He thought that love was one of the few things that makes life worth living but he changed his mind after his beloved Fanny's refusal. She, moreover, was in love with [[Antonio Ranieri]], Leopardi's best friend, who remained with the poet until the end. His desire, his hope, his &quot;sweet deceits&quot; are ended. His heart has beaten all his life but it's time for it to stop beating and staying still. There is no place for hope anymore. All he wants is dying, because death is the only good gift nature has given to human beings. In &quot;Love and Death&quot;, love was still considered a good thing because when you are in love you have stronger feelings, you feel alive in an always new way. Now he has become skeptical also about love, because if he can't have Fanny, nothing remains for him in life. He just wants to die, to make all the suffering end. Death is a gift as it is the end of all human pain, which is inevitable because it's in the essence of men, it's in the cruel project of nature. The last verse is &quot;e l'infinita vanità del tutto&quot; which means &quot;and the infinite vanity of the whole&quot; and it indicates the inanity of human life and human world.

====''Sopra un bassorilievo antico sepolcrale''====
[[File:ReliefSLorLuc.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pietro Tenerani]]: ''Monument to Clelia Severini'' (1825), which inspired the poem.]]

In the canto ''Sopra un bassorilievo antico sepolcrale'' (&quot;Over an Ancient Sepulchre Bas-relief&quot;), a young woman has died and is represented in the act of saying goodbye to her loved ones. The poet weighs the pros and cons of death, remaining in doubt about whether the young woman's destiny is good or bad.

Leopardi, even while being highly conscious of the indifference of nature, never ceased entirely to love it. In these verses, the poet poses challenging and pointed questions to nature, enumerating the ills and sufferings which, because of death, are inflicted on humanity. Under the influence of love, the poet had apparently found happiness at least in death (''Il pensiero dominante'', ''Amore e morte''). Now, instead, even this last illusion has fallen and he sees nothing but unhappiness everywhere.

====''Sopra il ritratto di una bella donna''====
''Sopra il ritratto di una bella donna scolpito nel monumento sepolcrale della medesima'' (&quot;On the portrait of a beautiful woman sculpted in her sepulchral monument&quot;) is basically an extension of the above.

The poet, drawing his inspiration from a funerary sculpture, evokes the image of a beautiful woman and compares her breathtaking beauty to the heart-rendingly sad image that she has become; one that is no more than mud, dust and skeleton. As well as being centred on the transience of beauty and of human things, the poem points to the specular [[antinomy]] between human ideals and natural truth. Leopardi does not deny—if anything, he emphasizes—the beauty of the human species in general, and by the end of the poem extends his point to all possible forms of beauty, intellectual as well as aesthetic. However, this universal beauty remains unattainable to a human nature that is nothing but &quot;polvere e ombra&quot; (&quot;dust and shadow&quot;), and that may touch—but never possess—the ideals that it perceives, remaining rooted to the natural world in which it was born, as well as to its demands.

====''La ginestra''====
[[File:Cytisus scoparius.jpg|thumb|right|[[Broom (plant)|Broom]]]]

In 1836, while staying near [[Torre del Greco]] in a villa on the hillside of [[Vesuvius]], Leopardi wrote his moral testament as a poet, ''La Ginestra'' (&quot;The [[Broom (shrub)|Broom]]&quot;), also known as ''Il Fiore del Deserto'' (&quot;The flower of the desert&quot;). The poem consists of 317 verses and uses free strophes of [[hendecasyllable]]s and [[septuplet]]s as its meter. It is the longest of all the ''Canti'' and has an unusual beginning. In fact, among all the Leopardian canti only this one begins with a scene of desolation, to be followed by an alternation between the enchantment of the panorama and of the starry night sky. On the literary level, it is the maximum realization of that anti-idyllic &quot;''new poetic''&quot; with which Leopardi had already experimented from the 1830s.

Leopardi, after having described the nothingness of the world and of man with respect to the universe; after having lamented the precariousness of the human condition threatened by the capriciousness of nature, not as exceptional evils but as continuous and constant; and after having satirized the arrogance and the credulity of man, who propounds ideas of progress and hopes, even while knowing he is mortal, to render himself eternal, concludes with the observation that reciprocal solidarity is the only defence against the common enemy which is nature (see ''Operette morali'', &quot;Dialogo di Plotino e Porfirio&quot;).

In this canto, in which Leopardi expresses his vast thought about mankind, history, and nature, autobiographical elements can be found: both direct (the places described are those who surround the poet in his late years) and indirect, in the image of a man who is poor, weak, but courageous enough to be aware of his real condition. The humble plant of [[broom (shrub)|ginestra]], living in desolate places without surrendering to the force of Nature, resembles this ideal man, who rejects any illusions about himself and does not invoke from Heaven (or Nature) an impossible help.

Vesuvius, the great mountain which brings destruction, dominates the entire poem. The only attainable truth is death, toward which man must inexorably advance, abandoning every illusion and becoming conscious of his own miserable condition. Such awareness will placate the mutual hatreds.

It is a vast poem, symphonically constructed with brilliant alternations of tone, from the grandiose and tragic painting of the volcano threatening destruction and of extensions of infertile lava, to the sharp ideological argumentation, to the cosmic sparks which project the nothingness of the earth and of man in the immensity of the universe, to the vision of the infinite passage of centuries of human history on which the immutable threat of nature has always weighed, to the gentle notes dedicated to the &quot;flower in the desert&quot;, in which are compressed complex symbolic meanings: pity toward the sufferings of man and the dignity which should be characteristic of man when confronted with the invincible force of a nature which crushes him.

An essential change occurs with the ''Ginestra'', which closes the poetic career of Leopardi along with ''Il tramonto della Luna'', which takes up the old themes of the fall of youthful illusions. The poem reiterates and reaffirms the sharp anti-optimistic and anti-religious polemic, but in a new and democratic register. Here, Leopardi no longer denies the possibility of ''civic'' progress: he seeks to construct an idea of progress founded precisely on his pessimism.

====''Il tramonto della Luna ''====
''Il tramonto della Luna'' (&quot;The Waning of the Moon&quot;), the last canto, was composed by Leopardi in Naples shortly before his death. The moon wanes, leaving nature in total darkness, just as youth passes away leaving life dark and derelict. The poet seems to presage the imminence of his own death.

In 1845, Ranieri published the definitive edition of the ''Canti'' according to the will of the author.

===Other poems===
====''Palinodia al marchese Gino Capponi''====
In the ''Palinodia al marchese Gino Capponi'' (&quot;[[Palinody]] to Marquis [[Gino Capponi]]&quot;), Leopardi fakes a retraction (&quot;Palinodia&quot;) of his pessimism. The work, written in 1835, was intended to be satirical (he first believes that man is unhappy and miserable, but now progress has made him reconsider his position), but the thought of the inevitable destruction to which nature condemns everything leads him to express bitter conclusions in spite of himself. Regarding this work, the Marquis Capponi wrote in a letter to Leopardi that he shared, at least in part, many of his ideas and thanked him for the &quot;noble verses&quot;. However, in a letter addressed to Viesseux, he expressed himself in rather different terms: &quot;Now it behoves that I write [back] to that damned hunchback who has put it into his head to mock me.&quot;

====''Paralipomeni della Batracomiomachìa''====
[[File:Brogi, Giacomo (1822-1881) - 5113 - Napoli, Museo nazionale. Omero. il miglior busto di questo poeta (Ercolano).jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Homer]]]]

The satiric tone adopted by Leopardi through much of the ''Operette morali ''is also evinced in some of his late poetic texts, such as the ''Palinodia'' and ''I nuovi credenti''. But the clearest demonstration of his mastery of this art form is probably the ''Paralipomeni della Batracomiomachia'', a brief comic-heroic poem of eight stanzas of eight lines each. Leopardi wrote it between 1831 and 1835, beginning it during his last stay in Florence and finishing it in Naples. The publication took place, posthumously, in Paris in 1842, provoking a universal reaction of outrage and condemnation, as much for the cutting and anti-heroic representation of the events of the [[Risorgimento]] as for the numerous materialistic philosophical digressions.

The term ''Paralipòmeni'' is Greek for &quot;things left undone or unsaid&quot;. ''Batracomiomachìa'' means &quot;war between the frogs and the mice&quot;. Batracomiomachia was also the title of a pseudo-Homeric poem which was actually written in the 4th or 5th century BC and translated by Leopardi between 1815 and 1826. The title therefore alludes to an integration of the original work, which is taken up again where it left off and the narrative progresses. The subject is a fable regarding the conflict between the mice that inhabit the nation of Topaia and the invading crabs. But behind the plot, there is hidden a robust sarcastic and polemical motivation. The animals and their doings have an allegorical value. In the crabs, portrayed unsympathetically and with monstrous characteristics, are to be recognized the Austrians; in the mice, sometimes generous but mostly ingenuous and cowardly, the liberal Italians. The poem represents the historical events that took place between 1815 and 1821: the climate of the Restoration desired by the [[Holy Alliance]] and the fruitless attempts at insurrection of 1820–21. Even the revolutionary movements of 1831 are included by Leopardi, who was able to follow them by way of the moderate Tuscan circles which he frequented and who perhaps provided him with the inspiration for the work.

The adoption of the poetic genre required the abandonment of the lyric style and the adoption of a narrative pace marked by a constant critical-satirical tension toward the ideological and philosophical beliefs of contemporary culture: Christian spiritualism, faith in progress, and anthropocentrism. Even the slogans of the political struggle of the liberals are derided, both in their expression of expectation of foreign intervention and in their faith in the model of a constitutional monarchy. In this fashion, the ''Paralipomeni'' represent another part of Leopardi's polemical war with the present, and above all an exceptional sally into the territory of historical/political commentary, generally not confronted by Leopardi in a direct form. Of the Italian Risorgimento, he delineates the fundamental limits here with an extraordinary tempestivity: the tendency to compromise with ancient interests and constituted powers, the vanity, the opportunism, the ideological ingenuousness, the lack of an opportune pragmatic awareness. The style generally renounces the expressive concentration of the lyric texts and extends itself in a wide and relaxed discursive pace, with alterations between adventurous moments and ferociously caricatural and polemical points, of description and philosophical digressions.

===''Pensieri'' (1837)===
[[File:Zibaldone di pensieri VI.djvu|thumb|upright|The ''Zibaldone di pensieri'', cover of the 1900 edition]]

In March 1837, shortly before his death, Leopardi announced that he would gather into one volume some &quot;thoughts&quot; (&quot;pensieri&quot;) on man and society. Such a collection was supposed to be part of a French edition of the complete works of Leopardi. A few months later (on 14 June) the poet died, leaving the work incomplete and the fragments were published by his friend Ranieri, who also provided the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Davies|first=Lizzy|date=2013-08-01|title=Translation of Giacomo Leopardi's Zibaldone published|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/giacomo-leopardi-zibaldone-translation-published|access-date=2020-05-29|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of the contents of ''Pensieri'' are derived from the ''Zibaldone''. The tone is sharply argumentative with respect to humanity, which Leopardi judges to be malevolent and it almost seems as if the poet wants to take his final revenge on the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Davies|first=Lizzy|date=2013-08-01|title=Translation of Giacomo Leopardi's Zibaldone published|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/giacomo-leopardi-zibaldone-translation-published|access-date=2020-05-29|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Zibaldone''===
[[File:Pensaments (1912).djvu|thumb|upright|''Pensaments'' by Leopardi, a 1912 Catalan edition of the ''Pensieri'']]

The ''[[Zibaldone]] di pensieri'' (see also [[Commonplace book#Zibaldone]]) is a collection of personal impressions, aphorisms, philosophical observations, philological analyses, literary criticism and various types of [[notebook (style)|notes]] which was published posthumously in seven volumes in 1898 with the original title of ''Pensieri di varia filosofia e di bella letteratura'' (''Miscellaneous Thoughts on Philosophy and Literature'').

The publication took place thanks to a special governmental commission presided over by [[Giosuè Carducci]] in occasion of the centennial anniversary of the poet's birth. It was only in 1937, after the republication of the original text enriched with notes and indices by the literary critic Francesco Flora, that the work definitively took on the name by which it is known today.

In the ''Zibaldone'', Leopardi compares the innocent and happy state of nature with the condition of modern man, corrupted by an excessively developed faculty of reason which, rejecting the necessary illusions of myth and religion in favor of a dark reality of annihilation and emptiness, can only generate unhappiness. The ''Zibaldone'' contains the poetic and existential itinerary of Leopardi himself; it is a miscellanea of philosophical annotations, schemes, entire compositions, moral reflections, judgements, small idylls, erudite discussions and impressions. Leopardi, even while remaining outside of the circles of philosophical debate of his century, was able to elaborate an extremely innovative and provocative vision of the world. It is not much of a stretch to define Leopardi as the father of what would eventually come to be called [[nihilism]].

[[Schopenhauer]], in mentioning the great minds of all ages who opposed [[optimism]] and expressed their knowledge of the world's misery, wrote: 
{{Quotation|But no one has treated this subject so thoroughly and exhaustively as Leopardi in our own day. He is entirely imbued and penetrated with it; everywhere his theme is the mockery and wretchedness of this existence. He presents it on every page of his works, yet in such a multiplicity of forms and applications, with such a wealth of imagery, that he never wearies us, but, on the contrary, has a diverting and stimulating effect.|''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. XLVI}}

'''Vasco da Gama''', 1st [[Count of Vidigueira]] ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|v|æ|s|k|oʊ|_|d|ə|_|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|m|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|v|ɑː|s|k|oʊ|_|d|ə|_|ˈ|ɡ|æ|m|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LPD|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EPD|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-pt|ˈvaʃku ðɐ ˈɣɐ̃mɐ|eu}}; c. 1460s – 24 December 1524), was a [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Portuguese explorer]] and the first European to reach [[India]] by sea. 

His initial voyage to India (1497–1499) was the first to link [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] by an ocean route, connecting the [[Atlantic]] and the [[Indian ocean|Indian]] oceans and therefore, the [[Western world|West]] and the [[Eastern world|Orient]]. This is widely considered a milestone in world history, as it marked the beginning of a sea-based phase of global [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cliff|last=Nigel|title=Holy War: How Vasco da Gama's Epic Voyages Turned the Tide in a Centuries-Old Clash of Civilizations|publisher=Harper|year=2011}}{{page number|date=January 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Da Gama's [[Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India|discovery of the sea route to India]] opened the way for an age of global [[imperialism]] and enabled the Portuguese to establish a long-lasting [[colonial empire]] in Asia. Traveling the ocean route allowed the Portuguese to avoid sailing across the highly disputed [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and traversing the dangerous [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The sum of the distances covered in the outward and return voyages made this expedition the longest ocean voyage ever made until then, far longer than a full voyage around the world by way of the [[Equator]].&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580'', p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

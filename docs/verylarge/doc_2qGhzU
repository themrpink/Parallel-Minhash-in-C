==Controversy as to the cause of her murder==
The [[beatification]] of St. Teresa Benedicta as a [[martyr#Christianity|martyr]] generated criticism. Critics argued that she was murdered because she was Jewish by birth, rather than for her Catholic faith,&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Foxman, Leon Klenicki (October 1998). [http://www.adl.org/opinion/edith_stein.asp &quot;The Canonization of Edith Stein: An Unnecessary Problem&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525130544/http://www.adl.org/opinion/edith_stein.asp |date=25 May 2011 }}, ''[[Anti-Defamation League]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, in the words of Daniel Polish, the beatification seemed to &quot;carry the tacit message encouraging conversionary activities&quot; because &quot;official discussion of the beatification seemed to make a point of conjoining Stein's Catholic faith with her death with 'fellow Jews' in Auschwitz.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=Harry James Cargas |first1=Harry James (ed.) |last1=Cargas |year=1994 |title=The Unnecessary Problem of Edith Stein |work=Studies in the Shoah |volume=IV |publisher=[[University Press of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.

{{Conservatism US}}
'''Henry Ross Perot''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ}}; born '''Henry Ray Perot'''; June 27, 1930&amp;nbsp;– July 9, 2019) was an American [[business magnate]], [[billionaire]], and [[philanthropist]]. He was the founder and [[chief executive officer]] of [[Electronic Data Systems]] and [[Perot Systems]]. He ran an [[Independent politician|independent]] presidential campaign in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and a [[third party (United States)|third-party]] [[#1996 campaign|campaign]] in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], establishing the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] in the latter election. Although he failed to carry a single state in either election, both campaigns were among the strongest [[List of third party performances in United States presidential elections|presidential showings by a third party or independent candidate]] in US history.

Born and raised in [[Texarkana, Texas]], Perot became a salesman for [[IBM]] after serving in the [[United States Navy]]. In 1962, he founded Electronic Data Systems, a data processing service company. In 1984, [[General Motors]] bought a controlling interest in the company for $2.4&amp;nbsp;billion. Perot established Perot Systems in 1988 and was an [[angel investor]] for [[NeXT]], a computer company founded by [[Steve Jobs]] after he left [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. Perot also became heavily involved in the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]], arguing that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in [[Southeast Asia]] after the [[Vietnam War]]. During the presidency of [[George H. W. Bush]], Perot became increasingly active in politics and strongly opposed the [[Gulf War]] and ratification of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].

In 1992, Perot announced his intention to run for president and advocated a balanced budget, an end to the [[outsourcing]] of jobs, and the enactment of [[e-democracy|electronic direct democracy]]. A June 1992 Gallup poll showed Perot leading a three-way race against President Bush and presumptive [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Bill Clinton]]. Perot briefly withdrew from the race in July, but re-entered the race in early October after he qualified for all 50 state ballots. He chose Admiral [[James Stockdale]] as his running mate and appeared in the 1992 debates with Bush and [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]. In the election, Perot received 18.9% of the popular vote, but did not win any electoral votes. However, he won over 19.7 million votes, far and away the most votes ever for a third-party candidate. He won support from across the ideological and partisan spectrum, but performed best among self-described moderates. Perot ran for president again in 1996, establishing the Reform Party as a vehicle for his campaign. He won 8.4 percent of the popular vote against President Clinton and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Bob Dole]].

Perot did not seek public office again after 1996. He endorsed Republican [[George W. Bush]] over Reform nominee [[Pat Buchanan]] in the 2000 election and supported Republican [[Mitt Romney]] in 2008 and 2012. In 2009, [[Dell]] acquired Perot Systems for $3.9&amp;nbsp;billion. According to ''[[Forbes]]'', Perot was the 167th richest person in the [[United States]] as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Forbes 400: 2017 Ranking&quot;. Forbes. October 2017. Retrieved October 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life, education, and military career ==
Ross Perot was born Henry Ray Perot in [[Texarkana, Texas]], the son of Lula May ([[Maiden and married names|née]] Ray) and Gabriel Ross Perot,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/political/perot.html |title=The Ancestors of Ross Perot |publisher=Wargs.com |access-date=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[commodity broker]] specializing in [[cotton]] contracts. His patrilineal line traces back to a [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] immigrant to the [[Louisiana (New France)|colony of Louisiana]] in the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |page=8 |first=Gerald |last=Posner |title=Citizen Perot |publisher=Random House |location=New York City |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Danny |last=Reagan |url=http://web.reporternews.com/dannyreagan/perot.html |title=The Perot/Bordelon Branches |access-date=February 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718221004/http://web.reporternews.com/dannyreagan/perot.html |archive-date=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended a local private school, Patty Hill, before graduating from [[Texas High School]] in Texarkana in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/deep-heart-texarkana-199530|title=Deep In The Heart Of Texarkana|last=EDT|first=Newsweek Staff On 6/28/92 at 8:00 PM|date=June 28, 1992|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=August 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TISD&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.txkisd.net/headlines/2009-2010/9%2016%2009%20Texarkana%20Independent%20School%20District%20Names%20H%20%20Ross%20Perot%20as%202009%20Distinguished%20Alumni.pdf |publisher=Texarkana Independent School District |title=Texarkana Independent School District Names H.

Perot started his first job at 8 years old, helping to distribute the ''Texarkana Gazette'' as a paperboy. While in his teens, Perot changed his middle name from Ray to Ross to honor his father, who died when Perot was 25 years old. Perot had an older brother, Gabriel Ross Jr., who died as a toddler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hall |first=Cheryl |url=https://www.dallasnews.com/business/business/2019/07/09/ross-perot-self-made-billionaire-patriot-philanthropist-dies-89 |title=Ross Perot, self-made billionaire, patriot and philanthropist, dies at 89 |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=July 9, 2019 |access-date=July 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perot joined the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and made [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in 1942, after 13 months in the program. He was a recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;honor&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Townley |first=Alvin |date=December 26, 2006 |url=http://www.thomasdunnebooks.com/TD_TitleDetail.aspx?ISBN=0312366531| title = Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts |publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York |pages=89–100, 108, 187, 194, 249, 260, 265|isbn=0-312-36653-1 |access-date=December 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;honor2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ray |first=Mark |year=2007 |url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0701/a-what.html |title=What It Means to Be an Eagle Scout |work=Scouting Magazine|publisher=Boy Scouts of America |access-date=January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1947 to 1949, he attended [[Texarkana Junior College]], then entered the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1949 and helped establish its [[Honor Concept|honor system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;honor&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=junior&gt;{{Cite web|last=The Associated Press|title=Ross Perot Gives $1 Million to Texarkana College|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2012/mar/23/ross-perot-gives-1-million-million-texarkana-colle/|access-date=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot claimed his appointment notice to the academy—sent by telegram—was sent by [[W.

In 1956 Perot married Margot Birmingham, whom he met on a blind date as a midshipman docked in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall&quot;/&gt;

== Business ==

After he left the Navy in 1957, Perot became a salesman for [[IBM]]. He quickly became a top employee (one year, he fulfilled his annual sales quota in a mere two weeks)&lt;ref&gt;''Sam Wyly'', 1000 Dollars &amp; an Idea, Publisher: Newmarket, {{ISBN|1-55704-803-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tried to pitch his ideas{{explain|date=August 2020}} to supervisors, who largely ignored him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Landrum|first1=Gene N.|title=Entrepreneurial Genius: The Power of Passion|date=2004|publisher=Brendan Kelly Publishing Inc.|location=Naples, FL|isbn=9781895997231|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRdwUrLj2rgC&amp;pg=PP1|access-date=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left IBM in 1962 to found [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS) in [[Dallas]], Texas and courted large corporations for his data processing services. Perot was denied bids for contracts 77 times before receiving his first contract. EDS received lucrative contracts from the [[US government]] in the 1960s, computerizing [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] records. EDS [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1968, and the stock price rose from $16 a share to $160 within days. ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' called Perot the &quot;fastest, richest Texan&quot; in a 1968 cover story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ross Perot|url=http://www.famous-entrepreneurs.com/ross-perot|website=Famous Entrepreneurs|access-date=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[General Motors]] bought a controlling interest in EDS for $2.4&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;
[[File:Ross Perot on 13 January 1983, from- Reagan Contact Sheet C12397 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Perot in 1983]]

In 1974, Perot gained some press attention for being &quot;the biggest individual loser ever on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]&quot; when his EDS shares dropped $450&amp;nbsp;million in value in a single day in April 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Moscow, &quot;An Astonishment of New York Superlatives: Biggest, Smallest, Longest, Shortest, Oldest, First, Last, Most, Etc.&quot; ''New York Magazine'' vol. 7, no. 1 (31 December 1973/7 January 1974) p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], the government of Iran imprisoned two EDS employees in a contract dispute. Perot organized and sponsored their rescue. The rescue team was led by retired [[United States Army Special Forces]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Arthur D. Simons|Arthur D. &quot;Bull&quot; Simons]]. When the team was unable to find a way to extract the two prisoners, they decided to wait for a mob of pro-[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah]] revolutionaries to storm the jail and free all 10,000 inmates, many of whom were political prisoners. The two prisoners then connected with the rescue team, and the team spirited them out of Iran via a risky border crossing into Turkey. The exploit was recounted in the book ''[[On Wings of Eagles]]'' by [[Ken Follett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ken-follett.com/|title=Ken Follett {{!}} Welcome|website=Ken Follett|language=en|access-date=August 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986 this was turned into a 2-part television mini-series (alternatively titled &quot;Teheran&quot;) with the actor [[Burt Lancaster]] playing the role of Colonel Simons.

In 1984, Perot's Perot Foundation bought a very early copy of [[Magna Carta]], one of only a few to leave the [[United Kingdom]]. The foundation lent it to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] where it was displayed alongside the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]]. In 2007, the foundation sold it to [[David Rubenstein]], managing director of [[The Carlyle Group]] for $21.3&amp;nbsp;million to be used &quot;for medical research, for improving public education and for assisting wounded soldiers and their families&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/nyregion/25magna.html|title=Magna Carta Is Going on the Auction Block|last=Barron|first=James|date=September 25, 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 27, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains on display at the National Archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/nyregion/19magna.html|title=Magna Carta Copy Sold|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Steve Jobs]] lost the power struggle at Apple and left to found [[NeXT]], his angel investor was Perot, who invested over $20&amp;nbsp;million. Perot believed in Jobs and did not want to miss out, as he had with his chance to invest in [[Bill Gates]]'s fledgling [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Steve Jobs|year=2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4516-4853-9|url=https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, he founded [[Perot Systems]] in [[Plano, Texas]]. His son, [[Ross Perot Jr.|Ross Perot, Jr.]], eventually succeeded him as CEO. In September 2009, Perot Systems was acquired by Dell for $3.9&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Connie|last1=Guglielmo|first2=Katie|last2=Hoffmann|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid%3D20601103%26sid%3DaMCNzaTRa9oQ|title=Dell Pays 68% Premium for Perot's Health Technology (Update3)|date=September 22, 2009|access-date=September 22, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603050643/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aMCNzaTRa9oQ |archive-date=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a visit to [[Laos]] in 1969, made at the request of the [[White House]],&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt; in which he met with senior [[North Vietnam]]ese officials, Perot became heavily involved in the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]].

Perot did not support President [[George H. W. Bush]], and vigorously opposed the United States' involvement in the 1990–1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].

[[File:Third debate 3267.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Perot shakes hands with [[Bill Clinton]] at the third presidential debate at [[Michigan State University]], October 19, 1992]]
On February 20, 1992, Perot appeared on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and announced his intention to run as an independent if his supporters could get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. With such declared policies as balancing the [[Balanced budget amendment|federal budget]], favoring certain types of gun control, ending the [[outsourcing]] of jobs and enacting [[e-democracy|electronic direct democracy]] via &quot;electronic [[town meeting|town halls]],&quot; he became a potential candidate and soon polled roughly even with the two major-party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://people-press.org/report/19920616/year-of-the-outsider |title=The Pew Research Center for People &amp; the Press: Year of the Outsider |date=June 16, 1992 |access-date=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perot's candidacy received increasing media attention when the competitive phase of the primary season ended for the two major parties. With the insurgent candidacies of Republican [[Pat Buchanan]] and Democrat [[Jerry Brown]] winding down, Perot was the natural beneficiary of [[populism|populist]] resentment toward establishment politicians. On May 25, 1992, he was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' with the title &quot;Waiting for Perot,&quot; an allusion to [[Samuel Beckett]]'s play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19920525,00.html |title=''Time'' magazine cover: H. Ross Perot|date=May 25, 1992|access-date=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months before the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of election news, as his supporters began petition drives to get him on the ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat [[Hamilton Jordan]] and Republican [[Ed Rollins]]. While Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization [[United We Stand America]]. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for was intended to reduce the deficit, such as a [[fuel tax]] increase and cutbacks to [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1992-10-14-9210140963-story.html |date=October 14, 1992|title=Ross Perots' plan to tax gasoline primes the pump |author=Mike Royko |publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June, Perot led a [[Gallup poll]] with 39% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/11/us/the-1992-campaign-on-the-trail-poll-gives-perot-a-clear-lead.html|title=The 1992 Campaign: On the Trail – Poll Gives Perot a Clear Lead|date=June 11, 1992|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, the Perot campaign fell into disarray.  [[1992 Democratic National Convention]] was held on Monday, July 13 through Thursday, July 16, during which time there was increased media coverage of the general election. ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' reported that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by Perot's unwillingness to follow their advice to be more specific on issues,&lt;ref name=&quot;milwaukee&quot; /&gt; and his need to be in full control of operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;milwaukee&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Jd8VAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5420,3383510&amp;dq=ross-perot&amp;hl=en|title=Perot advisers reportedly at odds|date=July 14, 1992|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Sentinel]]|page=2A|access-date=May 27, 2010|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[St. Petersburg Times]] reported such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign [[loyalty oath]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Perot asks volunteers to sign loyalty oaths|date=July 14, 1992|work=St. Petersburg Times|agency=Associated Press|page=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Perot's poll numbers had slipped to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Hamilton Jordan (a high-ranking manager in the Perot campaign) allegedly threatened to quit, but senior campaign officials denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Holmes|first=Steven A.|date=1992-07-14|title=Perot Adviser Threatens to Quit Over Frustrations With Campaign|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/14/news/opposition-independent-perot-adviser-threatens-quit-over-frustrations-with.html|access-date=2020-10-24|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist [[Hal Riney]], who had worked with Rollins on the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] campaign. Rollins would later claim that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/02/opinion/abroad-at-home-why-perot.html?pagewanted=1|title=Abroad at Home; Why Perot?|last=Lewis|first=Anthony|date=October 2, 1992|work=The New York Times|page=31|access-date=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/16/news/campaign-ross-perot-rollins-quits-perot-s-campaign-asserts-his-advice-was.html|title=Rollins Quits Perot's Campaign; Asserts His Advice Was Ignored|last=Holmes|first=Steven A|date=July 16, 1992|work=The New York Times|page=1|access-date=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Perot announced on ''Larry King Live'' that he would not seek the presidency. He explained that he did not want the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. Perot eventually stated the reason was that he received threats that digitally altered photographs would be released by the Bush campaign to sabotage his daughter's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/26/us/1992-campaign-overview-perot-says-he-quit-july-thwart-gop-dirty-tricks.html|title=The 1992 Campaign: The Overview – Perot Says He Quit in July to Thwart G.O.P.

Many of his supporters felt betrayed, and public opinion polls subsequently showed a largely negative view of Perot that was absent before his decision to end the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/19/us/1992-campaign-ross-perot-perot-says-he-may-rejoin-race-publicize-his-economic.html|title=The 1992 Campaign: Ross Perot – Perot Says He May Rejoin Race To Publicize His Economic Plan|last=Berke|first=Richard L.|date=September 19, 1992|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 27, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, he qualified for all 50 state ballots. On October 1, he announced his intention to re-enter the presidential race. He campaigned in 16 states and spent an estimated $12.3&amp;nbsp;million of his own money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Clymer |first=Adam |title=The 1992 Campaign: Perot Gave $12 Million to Aborted Campaign |work=New York Times |date=August 25, 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/25/us/the-1992-campaign-ross-perot-perot-gave-12-million-to-aborted-campaign.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot employed the innovative strategy of purchasing half-hour blocks of time on major networks for [[infomercial]]-type campaign advertisements; this advertising garnered more viewership than many sitcoms, with one Friday night program in October attracting 10.5&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The 1992 Campaign: The Media – Perot's 30-Minute TV Ads Defy the Experts, Again |page=A.19 |last=Kolbert |first= Elizabeth |work=New York Times |date=October 27, 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/27/nyregion/the-1992-campaign-the-media-perot-s-30-minute-tv-ads-defy-the-experts-again.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point in June, Perot led the polls with 39% (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Just prior to the debates, Perot received 7–9% support in nationwide polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/11/us/the-1992-campaign-on-the-trail-poll-gives-perot-a-clear-lead.html|title=The 1992 Campaign: On the Trail – Poll Gives Perot a Clear Lead|date=June 11, 1992|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 27, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debates likely played a significant role in his ultimate receipt of 19% of the popular vote. Although his answers during the debates were often general, Frank Newport of [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] concluded that Perot &quot;convincingly won the first debate, coming in significantly ahead of both the Democratic challenger Clinton and incumbent President George H.W. Bush&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/13525/What-History-Tells-About-Second-Third-Debates.aspx|title=What History Tells Us About Second and Third Debates|first=Gallup|last=Inc|website=Gallup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the debate, he remarked:
{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |Keep in mind our Constitution predates the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Our founders did not know about electricity, the train, telephones, radio, television, automobiles, airplanes, rockets, nuclear weapons, satellites, or space exploration.

Perot denounced Congress for its inaction in his speech at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in Washington, D.C., on March 18, 1992; he said:
{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |This city has become a town filled with [[sound bite]]s, [[shell game]]s, handlers, media stuntmen who posture, create images, talk, shoot off [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candles]], but don't ever accomplish anything.

In the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 election]], he received 18.9% of the popular vote, about 19,741,065 votes, but no [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] votes, making him the most successful third-party presidential candidate in terms of the popular vote since [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.270towin.com/1912_Election/ |title=Presidential Election of 1912 |work=270towin.com |access-date=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Perot, however, other third-party candidates since Roosevelt won multiple electoral college votes: [[Robert M. La Follette|Robert La Follette]] in 1924, [[Strom Thurmond]] in 1948, and [[George Wallace]] in 1968. Compared with Thurmond and Wallace, who polled very strongly in a small number of states, Perot's vote was more evenly spread across the country. Perot managed to finish second in two states: In [[Maine]], Perot received 30.44% of the vote to Bush's 30.39% (Clinton won with 38.77%); in [[Utah]], Perot received 27.34% of the vote to Clinton's 24.65% (Bush won with 43.36%). Although Perot did not win a state, he received a plurality of votes in some counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mustreadalaska.com/ross-perot-has-passed-he-placed-3rd-in-alaska-presidential-election-in-1992/|title=Ross Perot, 89, has passed: He placed 3rd in Alaska presidential election in 1992|last=Downing|first=Suzanne|date=July 9, 2019|website=Must Read Alaska|language=en-US|access-date=July 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-california-voting-history/|title=After decades of Republican victories, here's how California became a blue state again|last1=Krishnakumar|first1=Priya|last2=Arm|website=www.latimes.com|language=en|access-date=July 10, 2019|last3=Emamdjomeh|last4=Moore|first4=Maloy}}&lt;/ref&gt; His popular vote total is still by far the most ever garnered for a third-party candidate, almost double the previous record set by Wallace in 1968.

A detailed analysis of voting demographics revealed that Perot's support drew heavily from across the political spectrum, with 20% of his votes coming from self-described [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]], 27% from self-described [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], and 53% coming from self-described [[moderate]]s. Economically, however, the majority of Perot voters (57%) were middle class, earning between $15,000 and $49,000 annually, with the bulk of the remainder drawing from the upper-middle class (29% earning more than $50,000 annually).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=''Politics: Who Cares''|author1=Peirce Lewis|author2=Casey McCracken|author3=Roger Hunt|journal=American Demographics|date=October 1994|volume=16|page=23|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/case/3pt/perot_vote.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321084623/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/case/3pt/perot_vote.html|archive-date=March 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exit polls also showed that 38% of Perot voters would have otherwise voted for Bush, and 38% would have voted for Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DB1F3FF936A35752C1A964958260 |work=The New York Times |title=The 1992 Election: Disappointment – News Analysis – An Eccentric but No Joke; Perot's Strong Showing Raises Questions On What Might Have Been, and Might Be |first=Steven A. |last=Holmes |date=November 5, 1992 |access-date=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there were widespread claims that Perot acted as a &quot;spoiler,&quot; post-election analysis suggested that his presence in the race likely did not affect the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ross-perot-myth/|title=The Ross Perot Myth|last=FiveThirtyEight|date=October 6, 2016|website=FiveThirtyEight|language=en-US|access-date=August 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on his performance in the popular vote in 1992, Perot was entitled to receive federal election funding for 1996. Perot remained in the public eye after the election and championed opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). During the campaign, he had urged voters to listen for the &quot;[[giant sucking sound]]&quot; of American jobs heading south to [[Mexico]] should NAFTA be ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/specials/issues/world/wordepth/0916perot-infomercial.html|title=Perot TV Ad Assails U.S. Trade Policies|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=July 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perot tried to keep his movement alive through the mid-1990s, continuing to speak about the increasing national debt. He was a prominent campaigner against NAFTA, and frequently claimed that American manufacturing jobs will go to Mexico. On November 10, 1993, Perot debated with then-Vice President [[Al Gore]] on the issue on ''Larry King Live'' with an audience of 16 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;https://entertainment.time.com/2010/12/16/top-10-larry-king-moments/slide/al-gore-and-ross-perot-debate-nafta/&lt;/ref&gt; Perot's behavior during the debate was a source of mirth thereafter, including his repeated pleas to &quot;let me finish&quot; in his southern drawl.

In 1995, he founded the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] and won their presidential nomination for the [[1996 United States presidential election]]. His vice presidential running mate was [[Pat Choate]]. Because of the ballot access laws, he had to run as an Independent on many state ballots. Perot received 8% of the popular vote in 1996, lower than in the 1992 race, but still an unusually successful third-party showing by US standards. He spent much less of his own money in this race than he had four years prior, and he also allowed other people to contribute to his campaign, unlike his prior race. One common explanation for the decline was Perot's exclusion from the [[United States presidential debates|presidential debates]], based on the preferences of the Democratic and Republican party candidates. [[Jamie Raskin|Jamie B. Raskin]] of ''Open Debates'' filed a lawsuit over Perot's exclusion years later.&lt;ref name=od&gt;{{Cite web|title=Open Debates: Board of Directors|url=http://www.opendebates.org/aboutus/boardofdirectors.html|publisher=Opendebates.org|access-date=November 13, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053730/http://www.opendebates.org/aboutus/boardofdirectors.html|archive-date=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbsdeb&gt;{{Cite web|last=Richards|first=Paul J.|title=Do the debates unfairly shut out third parties?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57531685/do-the-debates-unfairly-shut-out-third-parties/|publisher=CBS news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later activities ===

In the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], Perot refused to become openly involved with the internal Reform Party dispute between supporters of [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[John Hagelin]]. Perot was reportedly unhappy with what he saw as the disintegration of the party, as well as his own portrayal in the press; thus, he chose to remain quiet. He appeared on ''Larry King Live'' four days before the election and endorsed [[George W. Bush]] for president. Despite his earlier opposition to NAFTA, Perot remained largely silent about expanded use of guest-worker visas in the United States, with Buchanan supporters attributing this silence to his corporate reliance on foreign workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buchanan.org/db00-0524.html|title=Perot: H1Bs and PNTR – The Giant Silence|publisher=Buchanan.org|date=May 24, 2000|access-date=October 20, 2004|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816031327/http://www.buchanan.org/db00-0524.html|archive-date=August 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Perot was asked to testify before the [[Texas Legislature]] in support of proposals to extend access to technology to students, including making laptops available to them. He supported changing the process of buying textbooks by making [[e-book]]s available and by allowing schools to purchase books at the local level instead of going through the state. In an April 2005 interview, Perot expressed concern about the state of progress on issues that he had raised in his presidential runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/042405dnediperot.3af4b33e.html |title=Point of Contact: H.

In January 2008, Perot publicly came out against Republican candidate [[John McCain]] and endorsed [[Mitt Romney]] for president. He also announced that he would soon be launching a new website with updated economic graphs and charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/94827 |title=Ross Perot Slams McCain|work=Newsweek|date=January 16, 2008 |access-date=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, his blog launched, focusing on [[entitlement]]s ([[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], [[Social security]]), the US national debt, and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/19/perot.charts/|title=Ross Perot wants more focus on national debt|author=Jason Carroll|publisher=CNN |date = June 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Perot endorsed Romney for president again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Dinan|first=Stephen|title=Ross Perot endorses Mitt Romney|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/oct/16/ross-perot-endorses-mitt-romney/|work=The Washington Times|access-date=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot did not give any endorsements for the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/ross-perot-death.html|title=Ross Perot, Brash Texas Billionaire Who Ran for President, Dies at 89|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|date=July 9, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 10, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Perot did not fit the typical stereotype of a conservative southerner; his views were seen as liberal and usually focused on his economic policy, to gain support from both Democratic and Republican voters from his home state of [[Texas]]. Perot supported [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]], stricter gun controls such as an [[assault rifle]] ban and increased research in [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ross_Perot_Gun_Control.htm|title=Ross Perot on Gun Control|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ross_Perot_Health_Care.htm|title=Ross Perot on Health Care|website=OnTheIssues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ross_Perot_Civil_Rights.htm|title=Ross Perot on Civil Rights|website=OnTheIssues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992, Perot was a [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]] activist, and a strong supporter of [[Planned Parenthood]]. He stated that poorer women in particular should have access to abortions via federal funding. From 2000, he was pro-choice reluctantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ross_Perot_Abortion.htm|title=Ross Perot on Abortion|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic policy===
Perot believed taxes should be increased on the wealthy, while spending should be cut to help pay off the national debt. Perot also believed the capital gains tax should be increased, while giving tax breaks to those starting new businesses.
{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |text=&quot;We cut the capital gains tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a maximum rate that got as low as 20% during the 1980s. Who got the benefit? The rich did, of course, because that's who owns most of the capital assets.&quot;|source=''Not For Sale at Any Price''}}

In his 1993 book ''Not For Sale at Any Price'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perot |first1=Ross |title=Not for Sale At Any Price: How We Can Save America for Our Children |url=https://archive.org/details/notforsaleatanyp00pero |url-access=registration |publisher=Hyperion |accessdate=July 10, 2019|isbn=9781562827236 |date=April 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot expressed support for giving tax cuts for [[small and medium-sized enterprises]], as opposed to larger corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/At_Any_Price.htm|title=''Not For Sale at Any Price'', by Ross Perot|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Perot supported a [[balanced budget]] amendment, stating, &quot;spending should not exceed revenue for 27 consecutive years.&quot; On trade, Perot stated that [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] caused the trade deficit between Mexico and the United States and a loss of manufacturing jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ross_Perot_Free_Trade.htm|title=Ross Perot on Free Trade|website=OnTheIssues}}&lt;/ref&gt; His position on free trade and NAFTA became his defining campaign principle of both the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections. Perot argued: &quot;We have got to stop sending jobs overseas. It's pretty simple: If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor, ...&amp;nbsp;have no health care—that's the most expensive single element in making a car—have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement, and you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.&quot;
{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |text=... when [Mexico's] jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours go down to six dollars an hour, and then it's leveled again. But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals.|source=The 1992 Campaign: Transcript of 2d TV Debate Between Bush, Clinton and Perot&quot;. ''[[The New York Times]]''.

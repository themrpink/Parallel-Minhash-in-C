==Background==
In 1992 Deighton said that the inspiration to write the novel came from his real-life neighbour [[Anna Wolkoff]], a [[White émigré|White Russian]] émigré who collaborated with a cipher clerk from the American embassy to spy for Germany in [[World War II]]. Deighton's mother cooked for Wolkoff's dinner parties and he said that he &quot;vividly&quot; remembered when British [[MI5]] agents came to arrest her: &quot;The experience was a major factor in my decision to write a spy story at my first attempt at fiction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spies With Class: Two of our best-loved, but vastly different, fictional spies, James Bond and Harry Palmer, have reached pensionable age|last=Campbell|first=Christy|work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|location=London|date=21 June 1992|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot involves [[mind control]], the [[acronym]] IPCRESS of the title standing for &quot;'''I'''nduction of '''P'''sycho-neuroses by '''C'''onditioned '''Re'''flex under Stre'''ss'''&quot;. The brainwashing is similar to a shock technique called [[psychic driving]] pioneered by [[Donald Ewen Cameron]] in the 1950s, originally on unwitting mental hospital patients, which was used and funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s secret [[MKULTRA]] program in Canada.

==Novel==
Deighton's protagonist is nameless; this is maintained through all the sequels (although later in the series called &quot;Charles&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Deighton, Len. ''Yesterdays Spy''. Harcourt Brace Janovich, 1975. p. 45, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the novel we learn that he worked for [[Military Intelligence]] for three years before joining his present agency – WOOC(P) – as a civilian employee. WOOC(P) is described as &quot;one of the smallest and most important of the Intelligence Units&quot;. (It is never stated exactly what the initials stand for, although his previous boss refers to it as Provisional.) We also learn in passing that he is from [[Burnley]], Lancashire, and that he was born in 1922 or 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Deighton | first = Len | authorlink = | title = The IPCRESS File | publisher = Ballantine | year = 1982 | location = | page = 25 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-345-30453-5 | quote = For example; take the time my picture appeared in ''The Burnley Daily Gazette'' in July 1939, when I won the fifth form mathematics prize.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WOOC(P) is a small department and the nameless hero has a great deal of autonomy.  He is also quite paranoid, keeping an &quot;escape package&quot; containing money, a false passport and other documents circulating in the mail.  Once a week he picks up the package from an [[accommodation address]], a seedy London shop, and re-mails it to that address in a fresh envelope. He is also a gourmet who enjoys good food. Cooking features frequently in both the film and the novel; Deighton himself was an accomplished cook.

In common with several of his other early novels, the chapter headings have a &quot;feature&quot;. In ''The IPCRESS File'' these take the form of each chapter being headed with a quote from a horoscope, which relates to the action in the chapter, though vaguely, as in most horoscopes.

The front cover, by Deighton's friend [[Raymond Hawkey]], has been described as &quot;the template for the covers of all subsequent [[airport novel]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dyckhoff |first1=Tom |title=They've got it covered |work=Guardian web edition |publication-date=15 September 2001 |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/history/story/0,6000,552107,00.html |accessdate=6 December 2007 | location=London | date=15 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
{{main|The Ipcress File (film)}}
A film adaptation starring [[Michael Caine]] was released in 1965 and produced by the [[James Bond]] co-producer [[Harry Saltzman]], assisted by several prominent members of the Bond production family. The film medium made it difficult to maintain the anonymity of Deighton's hero, who acquired the name [[Harry Palmer]].

The character's name was chosen by Caine, who was having lunch with Harry Saltzman. Saltzman invited Caine over to his table for coffee. They were trying to think of a name for the protagonist, and agreed that a boring name would best suit the protagonist's persona. Caine suggested the name Harry and then immediately apologised to Saltzman. However, Saltzman saw the funny side and pointed out that his real first name was actually Herschel, not Harry, so Saltzman was satisfied with it. The inspiration for the surname came from a boy called Palmer whom Caine knew at school. Caine described Palmer as: &quot;the most boring boy I'd ever met&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/citizen-caine-20100528 |title=Citizen Caine |author=David Schwartz |date=28 May 2010 |work=Moving Image Source |publisher=[[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] |accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The given name &quot;Harry&quot; actually occurs in a short sequence in the book where the nameless hero is greeted by someone saying &quot;Hello, Harry.&quot; This causes him to think, &quot;Now my name isn't Harry, but in this business it's hard to remember whether it ever had been.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Deighton |first=Len |authorlink=|title=The IPCRESS File |publisher=Ballantine |year=1982 |page=31 |isbn=0-345-30453-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and use==
Peyote has been used for at least 5,700 years by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in Mexico.&lt;ref name=prehistoric&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=El-Seedi HR, De Smet PA, Beck O, Possnert G, Bruhn JG |title=Prehistoric peyote use: alkaloid analysis and radiocarbon dating of archaeological specimens of Lophophora from Texas|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7754322|journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=101 |issue=1–3 |pages=238–42 |date=October 2005 |pmid=15990261 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2005.04.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans noted use of peyote in Native American religious ceremonies upon early contact, notably by the [[Huichol people|Huichols]] in Mexico. Other mescaline-containing cacti such as the San Pedro have a long history of use in South America, from Peru to Ecuador. While religious and ceremonial peyote use was widespread in the Aztec empire and northern Mexico at the time of the Spanish conquest, religious persecution confined it to areas near the Pacific coast and up to southwest Texas. However, by 1880, peyote use began to spread north of South-Central America with “a new kind of peyote ceremony” inaugurated by the Kiowa and Comanche people. These religious practices, incorporated legally in the United States in 1920 as the Native American Church, has since spread as far as Saskatchewan, Canada.&lt;ref name=prehistoric&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=El-Seedi HR, De Smet PA, Beck O, Possnert G, Bruhn JG |title=Prehistoric peyote use: alkaloid analysis and radiocarbon dating of archaeological specimens of Lophophora from Texas|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7754322|journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=101 |issue=1–3 |pages=238–42 |date=October 2005 |pmid=15990261 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2005.04.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional peyote preparations, the top of the cactus is cut off, leaving the large tap root along with a ring of green photosynthesizing area to grow new heads. These heads are then dried to make disc-shaped buttons. Buttons are chewed to produce the effects or soaked in water to drink. However, the taste of the cactus is bitter, so contemporary users will often grind it into a powder and pour it into capsules to avoid having to taste it. The usual human dosage is 200–400 milligrams of mescaline sulfate or 178–356 milligrams of mescaline hydrochloride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal096.shtml |title=#96 M – Mescaline (3,4,5-Trimethoxyphenethylamine) |work=PIHKAL |publisher=Erowid.org |access-date=7 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} button contains about 25&amp;nbsp;mg mescaline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Overdose and Detoxification Emergencies |location=New Hyde Park, NY. |publisher=Medical Examination Publishing Company |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-87488-182-0 |author1=Giannini, AJ |author2=Slaby, AE |author3=Giannini, MC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, English politician [[Christopher Mayhew]] took part in an experiment for [[BBC]]'s ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', in which he ingested 400&amp;nbsp;mg of mescaline under the supervision of psychiatrist [[Humphry Osmond]]. Though the recording was deemed too controversial and ultimately omitted from the show, Mayhew praised the experience, calling it &quot;the most interesting thing I ever did&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sotcaa.net/hiddenarchive/mayhew01.html |title=Panorama: The Mescaline Experiment |date=February 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183523/http://sotcaa.net/hiddenarchive/mayhew01.html |archivedate=26 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential medical usage ===
Mescaline has a wide array of suggested medical usage, including treatment of alcoholism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/03/09/could-lsd-treat-alcoholism/ |title=Could LSD treat alcoholism? |publisher=abcnews.go.com |date=9 March 2012 |access-date=5 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/human/magic-mushrooms-depression-122301.html |title=Magic Mushrooms could treat depression |publisher=news.discovery.com |date=23 January 2012 |access-date=9 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to these disorders having links to serotonin deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;Sari, Y.; Johnson, V. R.; Weedman, J. M. Role of the serotonergic system in alcohol dependence: from animal models to clinics. ''Progress in molecular biology and translational science'' '''2011''', 98, 401-443.&lt;/ref&gt; However, its status as a Schedule I controlled substance in the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] limits availability of the drug to researchers. Because of this, very few studies concerning mescaline's activity and potential therapeutic effects in humans have been conducted since the early 1970s.

== Biosynthesis ==
Mescaline is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from [[tyrosine]] which, in turn, is derived from [[phenylalanine]] by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. In ''Lophophora williamsii'' ([[Peyote]]), [[dopamine]] converts into mescaline in a biosynthetic pathway involving ''m''-''O''-methylation and aromatic hydroxylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Medicinal Natural Products: A Biosynthetic Approach |author=Dewick, Paul M. |location=United Kingdom |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=335–336 |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-471-49641-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyrosine and phenylalanine serve as the metabolic precursors to synthesis of mescaline. Tyrosine can either undergo a decarboxylation via [[tyrosine decarboxylase]] to generate [[tyramine]] and subsequently undergo an oxidation at carbon 3 by a [[monophenol hydroxylase]] or first be hydroxylated by [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] to form [[L-DOPA]] and decarboxylated by [[DOPA decarboxylase]]. These create dopamine, which then experiences methylation by a [[catechol-O-methyltransferase]] (COMT) by an [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM)-dependent mechanism. The resulting intermediate is then oxidized again by a hydroxylase enzyme, likely monophenol hydroxylase again, at carbon 5, and methylated by COMT. The product, methylated at the two meta positions with respect to the alkyl substituent, experiences a final methylation at the 4 carbon by a guaiacol-O-methyltransferase, which also operates by a SAM-dependent mechanism. This final methylation step results in the production of mescaline.

Phenylalanine serves as a precursor by first being converted to &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-tyrosine by [[L-amino acid hydroxylase]]. Once converted, it follows the same pathway as described above.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.plantsci.2006.10.013&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A review of recent studies of the biosynthesis and excretion of hallucinogens formed by methylation of neurotransmitters or related substances |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |year=1976 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=90–105 |pmid=779022 |doi=10.1093/schbul/2.1.90|last1=Rosengarten |first1=H |last2=Friedhoff |first2=A.

==Pharmacokinetics==
[[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] builds with repeated usage, lasting for a few days. Mescaline causes cross-tolerance with other [[serotonergic psychedelics]] such as [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[psilocybin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/psychedelicchemistry/chapter1.html |title=Psychedelics and Society |author=Smith, Michael Valentine |publisher=Erowid.org |access-date=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About half the initial dosage is excreted after 6 hours, but some studies suggest that it is not metabolized at all before excretion. Mescaline appears not to be subject to metabolism by [[CYP2D6]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9264312&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu D, Otton SV, Inaba T, Kalow W, Sellers EM |title=Interactions of amphetamine analogs with human liver CYP2D6 |journal=Biochem.

(mice), 132&amp;nbsp;mg/kg i.p. (rats), and 328&amp;nbsp;mg/kg i.p. (guinea pigs). For humans, the [[median lethal dose|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] of mescaline has been reported to be approximately 880&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Buckingham J|title=Mescaline|journal=Dictionary of Natural Products|pages=254–260|date=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral and non-behavioral effects ==

Mescaline induces a [[Psychedelic experience|psychedelic state]] similar to those produced by [[LSD]] and [[psilocybin]], but with unique characteristics. Subjective effects may include altered thinking processes, an altered sense of time and self-awareness, and closed- and open-eye visual phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovacic|first1=Peter|last2=Somanathan|first2=Ratnasamy|title=Novel, unifying mechanism for mescaline in the central nervous system|journal=Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity|date=1 January 2009|volume=2|issue=4|pages=181–190|doi=10.4161/oxim.2.4.9380|pmc=2763256|issn=1942-0900|pmid=20716904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominence of color is distinctive, appearing brilliant and intense. Recurring visual patterns observed during the mescaline experience include stripes, checkerboards, angular spikes, multicolor dots, and very simple [[fractals]] that turn very complex. [[Aldous Huxley]] described these self-transforming amorphous shapes as like animated stained glass illuminated from light coming through the eyelids. Like LSD, mescaline induces distortions of form and [[Kaleidoscope|kaleidoscopic]] experiences but they manifest more clearly with eyes closed and under low lighting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Enno Freye|title=Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs: A Comprehensive Review on their Mode of Action, Treatment of Abuse and Intoxication|collaboration=Joseph V. Levy|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2009|isbn=978-90-481-2447-3|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Heinrich Klüver]] coined the term &quot;cobweb figure&quot; in the 1920s to describe one of the four [[form constant]] geometric visual hallucinations experienced in the early stage of a mescaline trip: &quot;Colored threads running together in a revolving center, the whole similar to a cobweb&quot;. The other three are the chessboard design, tunnel, and spiral. Klüver wrote that &quot;many 'atypical' visions are upon close inspection nothing but variations of these form-constants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Dictionary of Hallucations |location=Oradell, NJ. |publisher=Springer |year=2010|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As with LSD, [[synesthesia]] can occur especially with the help of music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diaz&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=How Drugs Influence Behavior |author=Diaz, Jaime |location=Englewood Cliffs |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-02-328764-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual but unique characteristic of mescaline use is the &quot;geometricization&quot; of three-dimensional objects. The object can appear flattened and distorted, similar to the presentation of a [[Cubism|Cubist]] painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Drugs of Abuse |location=Oradell, NJ. |publisher=Medical Economics Books |year=1989 |pages=207–239 |isbn=978-0-87489-499-8 |author1=Giannini, A. James |author2=Slaby, Andrew E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mescaline elicits a pattern of sympathetic arousal, with the [[peripheral nervous system]] being a major target for this substance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diaz&quot;/&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
Mescaline is produced when products of natural mammalian [[catecholamine]]-based neuronal signaling such as dopamine and noradrenaline are subjected to additional metabolism via [[methylation]], and mescaline's hallucinogenic properties stem from its structural similarities with these two [[neurotransmitters]]. In plants, this compound may be the end-product of a pathway utilizing catecholamines as a method of stress response, similar to how animals may release compounds such as [[cortisol]] when stressed. The ''in vivo'' function of catecholamines has not been investigated, but they may function as [[antioxidant]]s, as developmental signals, and as integral cell wall components that resist degradation from pathogens. The deactivation of catecholamines via methylation produces alkaloids such as mescaline.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.plantsci.2006.10.013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Catecholamies are active compounds in plants |date=March 2007 |journal=Plant Science |volume=172 |issue=3 |pages=433–440 |doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2006.10.013 |last1=Kulma |first1=Anna |last2=Szopa |first2=Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mescaline acts similarly to other psychedelic agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14761703&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nichols DE |title=Hallucinogens |journal=Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=131–81 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14761703 |doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2003.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It acts as an agonist,&lt;ref&gt;Appel, J. B.; Callahan, P. M.

How activating the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor leads to psychedelia is still unknown, but it is likely that somehow it involves excitation of [[neuron]]s in the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17535909&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Béïque JC, Imad M, Mladenovic L, Gingrich JA, Andrade R |title=Mechanism of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor-mediated facilitation of synaptic activity in prefrontal cortex |journal=Proc.

== Legality ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, mescaline was made illegal in 1970 by the [[Controlled Substances Act|Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act]], categorized as a Schedule I hallucinogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/scheduling.html |title=Drug Scheduling |access-date=2 November 2007 |author=United States Department of Justice |author-link=United States Department of Justice |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020210309/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/scheduling.html |archive-date=20 October 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug was prohibited internationally by the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |title=List of psychotropic substances under international control |publisher=[[International Narcotics Control Board]] |access-date=27 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205125434/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |archivedate=5 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mescaline is legal only for certain religious groups (such as the [[Native American Church]] by the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978) and in scientific and medical research. In 1990, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the state of Oregon could ban the use of mescaline in Native American religious ceremonies. The [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA) in 1993 allowed the use of peyote in religious ceremony, but in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that the RFRA is unconstitutional when applied against states.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Many states, including the state of [[Utah]], have legalized peyote usage with &quot;sincere religious intent&quot;, or within a religious organization,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} regardless of race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/mooney062204.htm |title=State v. Mooney |publisher=utcourts.gov |access-date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While mescaline-containing cacti of the genus ''[[Echinopsis]]'' are technically controlled substances under the [[Controlled Substances Act]], they are commonly sold publicly as [[ornamental plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gupta |first1=Ramesh C. |title=Veterinary Toxicology: Basic and Clinical Principles |date=2018 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=9780123704672 |pages=363–390 |edition=Third }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, mescaline in purified powder form is a Class A drug. However, dried cactus can be bought and sold legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cacti/cacti_law2.shtml |title=2007 U.K. Trichocereus Cacti Legal Case Regina v. Saul Sette |publisher=Erowid.org |date=June 2007 |access-date=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Mescaline is considered a schedule 9 substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard (February 2020)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Poisons Stanrard&quot;&gt;[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020C00148 Poisons Standard February 2020]. comlaw.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; A schedule 9 substance is classified as &quot;Substances with a high potential for causing harm at low exposure and which require special precautions during manufacture, handling or use. These poisons should be available only to specialised or authorised users who have the skills necessary to handle them safely. Special regulations restricting their availability, possession, storage or use may apply.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poisons Stanrard&quot; /&gt;

The peyote cacti and other mescaline-containing plants such as San Pedro are illegal in [[Western Australia]], [[Queensland]], and the [[Northern Territory]], whilst in other states such as Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales, they are legal for ornamental and gardening purposes

=== Other countries ===

In Canada, France, The Netherlands and Germany, mescaline in raw form and dried mescaline-containing cacti are considered an illegal drug. However, anyone may grow and use peyote, or ''Lophophora williamsii'', as well as ''Echinopsis pachanoi'' and ''Echinopsis peruviana'' without restriction, as it is specifically exempt from legislation.&lt;ref name=Bib/&gt; In Canada, mescaline is classified as a schedule III drug under the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]], whereas peyote is exempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/Search/Search.aspx?txtS3archA11=mescaline&amp;txtT1tl3=%22Controlled+Drugs+and+Substances+Act%22&amp;h1ts0n1y=0&amp;ddC0nt3ntTyp3=Acts. |title=Justice Laws Search |publisher=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |access-date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

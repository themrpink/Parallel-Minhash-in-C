Ali G most recently appeared at the [[88th Academy Awards]]. Baron Cohen did not tell the ceremony's producers beforehand that he would appear on stage as his Ali G character instead of himself. He and his wife, actress [[Isla Fisher]], locked themselves in the bathroom for 40 minutes to secretly put on his costume, after telling people he had food poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-sacha-baron-cohen-academy-871690 | title=Oscars: Sacha Baron Cohen Says Academy Didn't Know He'd Present as Ali G | magazine=Hollywood Reporter | date=1 March 2016 | accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ali G is the leader of a fictional gang called &quot;Da West Staines Massif&quot;, who currently lives in his grandmother's garage in a semi-detached house at 36 Cherry Blossom Close, in the heart of the &quot;Staines Ghetto&quot;. He was educated at what he calls &quot;da Matthew Arnold Skool&quot;, which is [[Matthew Arnold School, Staines-upon-Thames|a real school in Staines]].

[[Staines]], a commuter town to the west of London, is different from the inner city [[ghetto]] that Ali G claims. In the same comic vein, he also makes reference to [[stockbroker belt]] towns in the area, such as [[Egham]], [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]] and [[Englefield Green]] with which he contrasts Staines. Despite the incongruous nature of his hometown, he purports to exemplify [[inner city]] culture. Ali's full name is later revealed to be '''Alistair Leslie Graham''' (revealed in the [[Ali G Indahouse|eponymous film]], much to his embarrassment).

Ali G speaks a comical [[wikt:patois|patois]] in keeping with his delusions of being black with [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] ancestry and peppered with such catchphrases as &quot;Aight&quot; or &quot;Aiii&quot; (alright), &quot;Booyakasha&quot;, &quot;Big up Yaself&quot;, &quot;Wagwaan&quot;, &quot;West Side&quot;, &quot;Batty Boy&quot; &quot;Respek&quot;, &quot;For Real&quot;, &quot;Punani&quot;, &quot;Check It&quot;, &quot;Wicked&quot; and &quot;Keep It Real&quot;. His trademark hand gesture closely resembles the &quot;dip snap&quot;.

==Criticisms==
Although Baron Cohen has repeatedly stated that Ali G is a parody of suburban, privileged youth acting in a way that they think is typical of black people, some commentators have opined that the force of the humour is derived from stereotypes of blacks, not poseur whites.  According to this view of the character, the suburban background written into Ali G's character serves as a false alibi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1117675.ece|title=Affronted feminist Naomi Wolf takes a bite out of 'racist' Ali G|date=9 March 2003|work=The Sunday Times | location=London | accessdate=23 April 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604150315/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1117675.ece | archivedate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4378509,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Race protest at Ali G's film premiere | first=Paul | last=Kelso | date=21 March 2002 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ali-g-keepin-it-real-for-real-750201.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Ali G: Keepin' it real, for real | first=John | last=Walsh | date=16 March 2002 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comedian [[Felix Dexter]] has said that he appreciated the humour of an innocent ignoramus confronting an expert with neither understanding the other, but felt that &quot;a lot of the humour is laughing at black street culture and it is being celebrated because it allows the liberal middle classes to laugh at that culture in a safe context where they can retain their sense of [[political correctness]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/11/race.janinegibson | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Comics find Ali G is an alibi for racism | first=Janine | last=Gibson | date=11 January 2000 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow comedian [[Victoria Wood]] criticised Baron Cohen's style of comedy, saying that his &quot;endless setting up of victims&quot; was &quot;tiresome&quot; and akin to &quot;laughing at lunatics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comic Wood slams 'tiresome' Ali G |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4223581.stm |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=BBC News |date=31 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|section|date=November 2020}}
* [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin]] (1930–), whom Ali G addresses as &quot;Buzz Lightyear,&quot; former astronaut, and the second [[Moonwalkers|man to walk on the moon]]: Ali asks him if he was &quot;ever jealous of [[Louis Armstrong]]&quot;, Aldrin has to correct him and reminds him that it was in fact [[Neil Armstrong]] who landed on the moon. Ali G also asks whether the &quot;people on the moon&quot; were friendly or scared of Aldrin upon landing on the moon. Ali insists that Aldrin should put conspiracy theorists straight, saying &quot;what do you say to all of those conspiracy theorists who come up to you and say, does the moon really exist?&quot;. He also believes that Aldrin was the first person to perform the moonwalk dance, not [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BEFORE 'BRÜNO,' THERE WAS ALI G: FIVE GREAT INTERVIEWS FROM THE MAIN MAN|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2432885/before-brno-there-was-ali-g-five-great-interviews-from-the-main-man/|publisher=MTV|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sacha Baron Cohen: best jokes and lines|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/05/24/sacha-baron-cohen-best-jokes-and-lines/ali-g0/|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=18 April 2018|date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Alderdice]], 43rd [[Lord Mayor of Belfast]]: Ali refers to him as the &quot;Lord Mayor of Ireland&quot; at the beginning of the interview. He also believed that [[Terry Wogan]] was part of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=G force|url=https://www.theguardian.com/ali/article/0,,195441,00.html|website=The Guardian|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[David Beckham]], [[Association football|football]] player, and [[Victoria Beckham]], a former member of the [[Spice Girls]].
* [[Tony Benn]] (1925–2014), former Labour MP for [[Chesterfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesterfield]], Cabinet Minister and chairman of the Labour Party from 1971 to 1972. Benn is shocked at Ali's stubborn and cynical view of the world. During the interview, Ali expresses his view that the workers [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|who went on strike in 1984]] were lazy and pulling a &quot;sickie&quot;, and that most people want to chill at home and watch TV instead of having to go to work. Ali suggests to Benn that celebrities and professional athletes such as [[Frank Bruno]] should become candidates, instead of barely known politicians who &quot;probably sleep with horses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How I tamed Ali G|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/mar/30/tvandradio.television|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=The Guardian|publisher=Tony Benn|date=30 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tony Benn meets Ali G: Watch Labour veteran burn Sacha Baron Cohen|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/tony-benn-meets-ali-g-watch-labour-veteran-burn-sacha-baron-cohen-9192169.html|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=The Independent|publisher=Felicity Morse|date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rhodes Boyson]] (1925–2012), former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Education Minister, who agreed with Ali G that the [[metric system]] should not be taught in schools because, &quot;one deals in quarters and eighths of ounces&quot;.
* [[Pat Buchanan]] (1938–), former [[White House Communications Director]] to [[President Reagan]], political commentator and former presidential candidate: Ali makes an irrelevant comparison of lying to become United States President, to himself falsely claiming to work hard at McDonald's but instead admitted to Buchanan that he ate 15 [[McChicken]] sandwiches, sold marijuana and that he wore the costume of [[Ronald McDonald]] while having sex. During the interview, he mistakenly refers to [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD bombs]] as [[BLT]] sandwiches. Buchanan apparently assumes he is referring to bio-lethal toxins; but near the end, he asks Buchanan &quot;is it ever worth fighting a war over sandwiches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ali G – sandwich war |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwEd_tcKBfU |via=YouTube |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] (1922–2016), former [[Secretary General of the United Nations]], mistakenly called 'Boutros Boutros Boutros Ghali' by Ali G. Boutros-Ghali clearly went so far as to participate in some of Ali G's notorious word games and providing the epilogue to the episode where, at Ali G's bidding, he tells youth viewers 'I am Boutros Boutros-Ghali; put down your guns and listen to [[Bob Marley]].' In response to Ali G's perceived ignorance, Boutros-Ghali provides a detailed explanation about why [[Disneyland]] is not represented in the United Nations, and reveals which foreign languages sound comical to his ear.
* [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928–), MIT professor and linguist:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Farndale | first=Nigel | date=6 July 2010 | title=Noam Chomsky Interview | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7865508/Noam-Chomsky-interview.html | accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this interview, Ali G is perplexed about the difference between the terms &quot;bilingual&quot; and &quot;bisexual&quot; after asking if his &quot;4-year-old part-Bangladeshi and part-English cousin will grow up to speak both languages&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Noam Chomsky interview|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7865508/Noam-Chomsky-interview.html|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=The Telegraph|date=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sam Donaldson]] (1934–), ABC news journalist for over 45 years: In the interview, Ali G confuses [[Watergate scandal|President Nixon's Watergate scandal]] with films [[Waterworld]] and [[Stargate]], and adds that the media should make it clearer for younger people. At the end of the interview, Ali admits to not paying taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Borat' Backlash Brings Anger, Lawsuits|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Entertainment/story?id=2646888&amp;page=1|accessdate=31 January 2018|agency=ABC NEWS|publisher=Nick Watt|date=11 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Marlin Fitzwater]] (1942–), former [[White House Press Secretary]] to US presidents George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan: Ali asks Fitzwater &quot;was it embarassassing working as a secretary, did it have the stigmata as working as a male nurse&quot;. Ali G expresses his belief that men who use the words &quot;discussion&quot; and &quot;conflict&quot; are homosexuals. Fitzwater ends the interview after calling Ali G an idiot due to Ali asking if he knows any secrets and implying if [[Hillary Clinton]] was a lesbian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Cheerful Confessions Of Ali G, Borat And Bruno|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/arts/the-cheerful-confessions-of-ali-g-borat-and-bruno.html|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=The New York Times|publisher=Virginia Heffernan|date=15 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jerome Isaac Friedman|Jerome Friedman]], MIT professor of physics and 1990 Nobel Prize winner
* [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], economist and public intellectual
* [[Daryl Gates]] (1926–2010), former [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles Police]] Chief: Shortly after the interview begins, Ali asks him &quot;what was it like being the head of the NYPD?&quot;, after Gates corrects him, Ali blames a language barrier as the cause of the misunderstanding, adding &quot;well you says tomato, I says potato&quot;. During the midst of the interview, Ali confuses [[OJ Simpson]] for [[Homer Simpson]]. Ali asks for information regarding criminals who swallow condoms which contain drugs and pretends to write down the information given to him, implying that he will later use the information practically. At the end of the interview, Ali incorrectly refers to him as [[Bill Gates]].
* [[Newt Gingrich]] (1943–), former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]]: At the very beginning of the interview, he spends nearly one minute asking Gingrich how to spell and pronounce his name. Ali expresses his concern that if a female ever became President of the United States then she would spend too much time buying facial products, shopping and new shoes, also saying that a female president would elect [[George Clooney]] and [[Brad Pitt]] as part of the cabinet administration. Gingrich replies &quot;I think if you said that to most women who could be President, you'd be surprised how tough they are&quot; and also citing Margaret Thatcher as one of the three best prime ministers of the 20th century. Ali is also worried that a female elected president would start crying if the U.S. were at war and that she would &quot;get more and more hornier&quot; if a rival did &quot;bad things&quot; to the U.S. as &quot;women love bastards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gingrich holds no grudge against 'Ali G'|url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/click/2011/12/gingrich-holds-no-grudge-against-ali-g-107464|website=Politico|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]], former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician.
* [[Kent Hovind]] (1953–), [[evangelism|evangelist]] and [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]]: During the interview, Ali G repeatedly says &quot;shame on you&quot; to Hovind due to believing that he did not flush the toilet whilst backstage. Ali also believes that humans are descended from monkeys on the basis that Hovind admitted to eating a banana, according to Ali, his admission serves as proof. Ali then proceeds to shut down Hovind, telling him to &quot;speak to the hand because the face ain't listening, yo&quot;.
* [[Richard James Kerr]] (1935–), deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency to [[George H. W. Bush]]: Ali G asked Kerr what kind of punishment should suicide terrorists face, after blowing themselves up. He also expresses his belief to Kerr that threatening suicide bombers with 20 years in prison may act as a deterrent.
* [[Glenn Hubbard (baseball)|Glenn Hubbard]], former professional baseball player
* [[John Humphrys]], BBC presenter / journalist
* Derrick Hussey, publisher and proprietor of [[Hippocampus Press]]
* [[Reed Irvine]], founder of [[Accuracy in Media]]

* [[C. Everett Koop]] (1916–2013), former [[Surgeon General of the United States]] to [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]: during the interview, Ali cannot comprehend why his erection is not actually a bone. He accuses Dr. Koop of being a &quot;player hater&quot; when the doctor breaks the news that all people will eventually die, and tries to convince the Surgeon General that his deceased pet cat was actually human. Ali suggests removing the organs out of the human body and replacing them with a mobile phone. He also asks why the human heartbeat is &quot;so old fashioned&quot;, and his &quot;homies&quot; would look after and respect their heart if they had a drum and bass heartbeat that they could relate to. Ali also asks the Surgeon General why all skeletons are involved in &quot;evil stuff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sacha Baron Cohen: 'Hollywood would be too scared to make Borat today'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/grimsby/sacha-baron-cohen-interview/|newspaper=The Telegraph|publisher=John Hiscock|accessdate=18 April 2018|date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[James Lipton]] (1926–2020), host of [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''. Ali G accuses Lipton of homosexual behavior because he cries while watching films. Lipton expresses that he hates the word &quot;hoe&quot; so Ali instead uses the word &quot;bitches&quot; to describe his opinion that women are better &quot;actors&quot; than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BEFORE 'BRÜNO,' THERE WAS ALI G: FIVE GREAT INTERVIEWS FROM THE MAIN MAN|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2432885/before-brno-there-was-ali-g-five-great-interviews-from-the-main-man/|publisher=MTV|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ralph Nader]] (1934–), consumer activist and former US presidential candidate for the Green Party in 1996 &amp; 2000: Ali wonders what is the big deal with saving the rainforest because he believes no one has ever lived there and there is not a KFC or McDonald's nearby. After discovering that people do live there, he believes that one would have to be crazy to live there due to the danger of a monkey defecating on a person's head. While talking about how to save money on electricity, unknown to Ali G, he admits to illegally rigging his home electrical meter and doing Nader a favor after he is &quot;well negative about it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tracy|first1=Kathleen|title=Sacha Baron Cohen: The Unauthorized Biography: From Cambridge to Kazakhstan|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lqMEpeNCwL0C&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;q=ralph%20nader%20sacha%20baron%20cohen|accessdate=13 January 2018|isbn=9781429993937|date=26 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas J. Pickard]], former acting [[FBI Director]]: Ali G asks Pickard if he knows what is in the basement of [[Studio 54]], referring to the X-Files. After he acknowledges what he is implying, Ali hums the X-Files theme tune.
* [[Gail Porter]], television presenter
* [[Sue Ramsey]], Irish politician, [[Sinn Féin]]
* [[Sally Jessy Raphaël]], former talk show host, (who congratulated him for 'being himself')
* [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] (1969–), [[Conservatives (UK)|Conservative Party]] parliamentary candidate, investment banker and future [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for North East Somerset (2010–present). Ali incorrectly addresses him as &quot;Lord Rees-Mogg&quot;. He asks him &quot;which class is [[Pakistani|Pakis]] in&quot; and wonders if he impregnated the daughter of a lord, which class would the baby belong to. During the interview, he borrows a top hat from Rees-Mogg, believing he would be upper-class if he wore it, Rees-Mogg compares him to [[Lord Snooty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacob Rees-Mogg: a Boris in the making?|url=https://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/interview/jacob-rees-mogg-boris-making|website=Total Politics|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Jacob Rees-Mogg for Tory leader is no laughing matter|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/20/jacob-rees-mogg-tory-leader-no-laughing-matter|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=Michael Segalov|accessdate=18 April 2018|date=20 July 2017|last1=Segalov|first1=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andy Rooney]], of the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] programme ''[[60 Minutes]]'', who repeatedly corrects Ali G's poor grammar, and responds angrily to Ali G's foolish questions about the current state of the media. (It is worth noting that Ali G wonders whether the media would ever publish the results of a presidential election early; while Rooney dismisses this idea as preposterous, this is precisely what the Chicago Daily Tribune did in 1948, falsely reporting that Thomas E. Dewey had defeated Harry S. Truman). Rooney thus furiously and abruptly ends his interview, claiming a busy schedule. Ali G then characterizes Rooney's treatment of him as &quot;racialist,&quot; using a variant of the word &quot;racist,&quot; the former of which Rooney does not believe to be a real word.
* [[Charles Schultze]], former Chief Economic Advisor to President Jimmy Carter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksGzn5bRFzQ |title=Ali G – Economics and Selling Stocks High |via=YouTube |date=27 August 2006 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brent Scowcroft]], former [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] and Air Force General
* [[Tomasz Starzewski]] (1961–), fashion designer: At the very beginning of the interview, Ali G thinks Starzewski's suit is made out of vaginal hair. Starzewski was offended when Ali asked if he would make clothes for any woman, &quot;even if she has nice personality but a face like a [[rottweiler]]'s ass&quot;, believing that it would bring on shame for Starzewski's clothing brand if he decided to make clothes for unattractive women. At the end of the interview, Ali assumed that he was happy when fashion designer, [[Gianni Versace]], was murdered as &quot;there was less competition&quot;.
* [[Teddy Taylor]] (1937–2017), former MP for the Conservative Party: Ali expresses his belief that most countries in Europe are &quot;crap countries&quot;, he also thinks it is racist as a result of Jamaica not being part of Europe. He asks Taylor if himself will still be able to buy pornography &quot;with dogs and women&quot; and if that particular category will be available in the UK. At the end of the interview, Ali G suggests that if people want to join Europe then they should have a &quot;brian&quot;, referring to a human brain.
* [[Dick Thornburgh]] (1932–), former U.S. Attorney General and governor of [[Pennsylvania]]. While both men are discussing murder and the law, Ali believes it is justifiable to murder someone &quot;if they call your mum or nana a hoe&quot;. Ali has a hard time distinguishing the meaning of a &quot;hung jury&quot; and an erection, Thornburgh laughs and wishes he made it more clearer for Ali. In the interview, he wonders if &quot;whoever smelt it deal it&quot;, in reference to farting, is a crime in the United States. He also believes if a prisoner on the death penalty is given a free meal then the person would be able to eat forever, subsequently avoiding the execution.
* [[Edwin Meese]] (1931–), former United States Attorney General and counselor to President Ronald Reagan. Ali G is baffled that is illegal to steal a person's television but not their girlfriend, implying that a girlfriend should become property and even suggesting that the government should do something about it. After Meese discovers that he has been pranked, he agrees to say &quot;I was attorney general, my name is Meese, I say go to college and don't carry a [[gun|piece]].&quot;
* [[Stansfield Turner]] (1923–2018), former director of [[Central Intelligence Agency]]: After Turner explains what the CIA stands for, Ali asks &quot;so does it help if you is intelligent if you want to get in&quot;, Ali believes it is &quot;[[racist|racialist]]&quot; that the CIA will not hire stupid people. His concern and definition of racist is &quot;ain't it unfair for those people who will feel bad inside if you won't allow them in there&quot;, Turner immediately laughs and Ali questions his reason for laughing. Turner politely remarks that Ali is intelligent after asking if he could ever join the CIA. Ali believes that female undercover CIA agents have cameras attached to their vagina and that they wear uniforms whilst on special missions. At the end of the interview, he questions &quot;how do we actually know [[Louie Armstrong]] was actually stood on the moon&quot;, and he expresses his belief to Turner that [[Kevin Costner]] knew who murdered President JFK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robert A.

* [[Gore Vidal]], author and essayist (whom Ali G mistook for [[Vidal Sassoon]]).
* [[Christine Todd Whitman]] (1946-), first female and former [[New Jersey]] governor and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] administrator: Ali is concerned about solar energy and worries that the sun will run out of energy and fuel if humans continue to use solar energy, he adds that [[Alaska]] has already &quot;overused&quot; the sun as &quot;there is like darkness for months every year&quot;. After asking why the ocean is dirty, his proof is that fishes and whales are defecating too much and that humans should tell the fish not to defecate in the water.
* [[Sammy Wilson (politician)|Sammy Wilson]], Northern Irish politician, [[Democratic Unionist Party]].
* [[Naomi Wolf]] (1962–), former political advisor to [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Al Gore]], author and [[feminist]]: Ali expresses his concern that if women are granted human rights in the workplace then they will start asking for human rights at home. He also adds that men are the best cooks in the world and uses [[Colonel Sanders]] and [[Ronald McDonald]] as examples, compared to &quot;Wendy&quot;; the mascot of [[Wendy's]] Fast-food Restaurant, Wolf surprisingly agrees with him. Ali baits Wolf by expressing his view that women have better job opportunities than men, such as lap dancers, extras in music videos and strippers. He gives Wolf a &quot;compliment&quot; by saying that she could possibly work as a prostitute due to her attractiveness.
* [[Heinz Wolff]] (1928–2017), scientist and former emeritus professor of bioengineering at [[Brunel University]]: Ali asks if &quot;[[Penis enlargement|knob enlargement's]]&quot; are in correlation with science. He also asks &quot;is infinite a number&quot; and is unconvinced by Wolff's explanation, repeatedly saying &quot;million&quot; and &quot;billion&quot; and asking if it is smaller than the given numbers. Wolff says that he could always add 1 to each given number, Ali ends the interview by saying &quot;and that number is infinite&quot;.
* Professional basketball players [[Steve Nash]] (who was an award-winning player &quot;[[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MP3]]&quot; according to Ali G and unable to speak proper English due to being Canadian), [[Kobe Bryant]] (whom he asks about the number of springs in a basketball), [[Ben Wallace]] (who he accuses of &quot;playa-hating&quot;), [[Shaquille O'Neal]] (whom he argued with about the meaning of the NBA, Ali thinking it stood for Nationwide Basketball Society), [[Tim Duncan]] (from whom he tried to get a pair of free [[sneakers|trainers]]), [[Robert Horry]], [[Dwyane Wade]] (who he did not realise was an NBA player, claiming he had just &quot;sneaked in&quot; to &quot;hang with mah man Shaquille O'Neal&quot;), [[Richard Jefferson]] (whom he called [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s son), [[Charles Barkley]], [[Kenny Smith]] and [[Reggie Miller]].

'''Meliaceae''', the '''mahogany family''', is a [[flowering plant]] family of mostly [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s (and a few [[herbaceous]] plants, [[mangroves]]) in the order [[Sapindales]].

They are characterised by alternate, usually pinnate leaves without [[stipule]]s, and by syncarpous,&lt;ref&gt;Of a [[gynoecium]], made up of united carpels&lt;/ref&gt; apparently bisexual (but actually mostly cryptically unisexual) [[flower]]s [[Inflorescence|borne]] in panicles, cymes, spikes, or clusters. Most species are [[evergreen]], but some are [[deciduous]], either in the [[dry season]] or in winter.

The family includes about 53 genera and about 600 known species,&lt;ref name=&quot;Christenhusz-Byng2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Christenhusz, M. J. M. |author2=Byng, J.

The fossil record of the family extends back into the Late Cretaceous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atkinson|first=Brian A.|date=January 2020|title=Fossil evidence for a Cretaceous rise of the mahogany family|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajb2.1416|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=107|issue=1|pages=139–147|doi=10.1002/ajb2.1416|issn=0002-9122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen appeared during two-minute sketches as his fashion reporter [[Brüno (character)|Brüno]] on the [[Paramount Comedy 1|Paramount Comedy Channel]] during 1998. He shot to fame with his comic character Ali G, a fictional stereotype of a British suburban male &quot;[[chav]]&quot; who imitates urban [[Black British|black]] [[British hip hop]] culture and [[British Jamaican]] culture, as well as speaking in [[rude boy]]-style [[Multicultural London English|English with borrowed expressions]] from [[Jamaican Patois]]. Hailing from [[Staines]] (a suburban town in Surrey, to the west of London), Ali G started appearing on the British television show ''[[The 11&amp;nbsp;O'Clock Show]]'' on [[Channel 4]], which first aired on 8 September 1998.

At the 2012 British Comedy Awards, 13 years after winning Best Newcomer at the 1999 Comedy Awards, Baron Cohen accepted the Outstanding Achievement Award from Sir [[Ben Kingsley]] in the guise of Ali G, and stated: &quot;I is grown up now. I ain't living in my nan's house anymore. I is living in her garage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifetime award&quot;/&gt;

Ali G's interviews with celebrities (often politicians) gained notoriety partly because the subjects were not privy to the joke that Ali G, rather than being a real interviewer, was a comic character played by Baron Cohen. According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Baron Cohen would always enter the interview area in character as Ali G, carrying equipment and appearing to be an inconspicuous crew member. He would arrive with a suited man, whom the interviewee naturally thought was the interviewer. Baron Cohen, as Ali G, would sit down to begin conducting the interview by asking the interviewee some preliminary questions. The interviewee, however, would remain under the impression that the smartly-dressed director would be conducting the interview until short notice prior to cameras rolling: this would grant an advantage of surprise, whereby the interviewee would be less likely to opt out of the Ali interview prior to its start.&lt;ref name=manbehindmustache&gt;{{cite news|last =Strauss|first =Neil|title =The man behind the mustache|work =Rolling Stone|date =14 November 2006|url =https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks|access-date =14 August 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070102223451/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks|archive-date =2 January 2007|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character was featured in segments of ''Da Ali G Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Sara |title=Sacha Baron Cohen was nearly killed filming ‘Bruno’ |url=https://nypost.com/2016/03/03/sacha-baron-cohen-was-nearly-killed-filming-bruno/ |work=New York Post |date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borat's sense of humour derives from his mocking of society through outrageous sociocultural viewpoints, his [[deadpan]] violation of social taboos and use of vulgar language and behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Sacha Baron Cohen: Our man from Kazakhstan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/sep/10/comedy |access-date=19 October 2019 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guilt-free pleasures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/jan/03/comedy.television |access-date=19 October 2019 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen won the 2007 [[Golden Globe]] in the &quot;[[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor – Musical or Comedy]]&quot; category, his sixth such award. Although Borat was up for &quot;Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy&quot;, the film lost to ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''. On 23 January 2007, he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. He shared his nomination with the film's co-writers, Ant Hines, [[Peter Baynham]], [[Dan Mazer]], and [[Todd Phillips]].

Aside from the comic elements of his characters, Baron Cohen's performances are interpreted by some as reflecting uncomfortable truths about his audience. He juxtaposes his own Jewish heritage with the anti-Semitism of his character Borat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borat.tv/video/Throw_the_Jew_Down_the_Well.mov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327094957/http://www.borat.tv/video/Throw_the_Jew_Down_the_Well.mov|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 March 2006|title=Borat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

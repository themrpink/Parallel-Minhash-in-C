{{main|Orange County Board of Supervisors}}

Each of the five members of the Board of Supervisors is elected from a regional district, and together, the board oversees the activities of the county's agencies and departments and sets policy on development, public improvements, and county services. At the beginning of each calendar year, the Supervisors select a Chair and Vice Chair amongst themselves. The Chair presides over board meetings, and the Vice Chair presides when the Chair is not present. The Board appoints the [[Clerk (legislature)|Clerk of the Board of Supervisors]], the [[general counsel|County Counsel]], the [[performance audit|Performance Audit]] Director, and the Director of the Office of Independent Review. The Board also appoints the County Executive Officer to act as the chief administrative officer of the county and the manager of all agencies and departments not under the sole jurisdiction of an elected county official nor the sole jurisdiction of one of the four aforementioned officers appointed by the Board.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocgov.com/gov/bos/yourboard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126062451/http://ocgov.com/gov/bos/yourboard|title=Your Board of Supervisors|publisher=County of Orange, California|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 26, 2017|access-date=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pension scandal===
{{recentism|section|date=January 2017}}
On July 12, 2010, it was revealed that former Sheriff [[Mike Carona]] received over $215,000 in pension checks in 2009, despite his felony conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Esquivel | first = Paloma | title = Convicted Orange County Sheriff Collects $215,000 Pension | work = Los Angeles Times | date = July 9, 2010 | url = https://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/09/local/la-me-oc-pension-20100709}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 state law denied a public pension to public officials convicted of wrongdoing in office, however, that law only applied to benefits accrued after December 2005. Carona became eligible for his pension at age 50, and is also entitled, by law, to medical and dental benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Why Does Mike Carona Get a $200,000 Pension? | newspaper = Orange County Register | date = August 21, 2013 | url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/carona-173698-office-law.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Assembly Bill No. 1044 | publisher = Legislative Counsel: State of California | url = http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/05-06/bill/asm/ab_1001-1050/ab_1044_bill_20050922_chaptered.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted that the county's retirement system faces a massive shortfall totaling $3.7&amp;nbsp;billion unfunded liabilities, and Carona was one of approximately 400 retired Orange County public servants who received more than $100,000 in benefits in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lester |first=John |title=California Disgraced Sheriff Pension Retirement |url=http://www.newsoxy.com/world/disgraced-sheriff-pension-13760.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716163500/http://www.newsoxy.com/world/disgraced-sheriff-pension-13760.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 16, 2010 |access-date=November 6, 2016 |work=newsoxy.com |date=July 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the list of those receiving extra-large pension checks is former treasurer-tax collector [[Robert Citron]], whose investments, which were made while consulting psychics and astrologers, led Orange County into bankruptcy in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martinez |first=Edecio |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/disgraced-sheriffs-pension-215000-after-witness-tampering-conviction/ |title=Disgraced Sheriff's Pension $215,000 After Witness Tampering Conviction |publisher=CBS News |date=July 12, 2010 |access-date=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citron, a Democrat, funneled billions of public dollars into questionable investments, and at first the returns were high and cities, schools and special districts borrowed millions to join in the investments.  But the strategy backfired, and Citron's investment pool lost $1.64&amp;nbsp;billion. Nearly $200&amp;nbsp;million had to be slashed from the county budget and more than 1,000 jobs were cut. The county was forced to borrow $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/01/17/obit-citron-orange-county-bankruptcy/1842401/|title=Man Blamed for Orange County Bankruptcy Dies|date=January 17, 2013|website=USA Today|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility filed a lawsuit against the pension system to get the list. The agency had claimed that pensioner privacy would be compromised by the release. A judge approved the release and the documents were released late June 2010.  The release of the documents has reopened debate on the pension plan for retired public safety workers approved in 2001 when Carona was sheriff.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Esquivel |first=Paloma |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-oc-pension-20100709,0,5477333.story |title=Convicted Orange County sheriff collects $215,000 pension |work=latimes.com |date=July 9, 2010 |access-date=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Called &quot;3 percent at 50,&quot; it lets deputies retire at age 50 with 3 percent of their highest year's pay for every year of service. Before it was approved and applied retroactively, employees received 2 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.porac.org/3percent@50.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000830101102/http://www.porac.org/3percent@50.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 30, 2000 |title=Peace Officers Research Association of California |publisher=Porac.org |access-date=July 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;It was right after [[September 11 attacks|Sept. 11]],&quot; said Orange County Supervisor [[John Moorlach]]. &quot;All of a sudden, public safety people became elevated to god status. The Board of Supervisors were tripping over themselves to make the motion.&quot;  He called it &quot;one of the biggest shifts of money from the private sector to the public sector.&quot;  Moorlach, who was not on the board when the plan was approved, led the fight to repeal the benefit. A lawsuit, which said the benefit should go before voters, was rejected in Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2009 and is now under appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes.com&quot;/&gt;  Carona opposed the lawsuit when it was filed, likening its filing to a &quot;nuclear bomb&quot; for deputies.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

During most of the 20th century and up until 2016, Orange County was known for its political [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] and for being a bastion for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], with a 2005 academic study listing three Orange County cities as among America's 25 most conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/ |title=Study ranks America's most liberal and conservative cities |publisher=Govpro.com |date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=July 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722203607/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/ |archive-date=July 22, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the county's changing demographics have coincided with a shift in political alignments. In [[United States presidential election in California, 2016|2016]], [[Hillary Clinton]] became the first Democrat since 1936 to carry Orange County in a presidential election and in the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections in California|2018 midterm elections]] the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] gained control of every Congressional seat in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARELLANO&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wildermuth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT Thornton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Nagourney&quot;/&gt; Although Democrats control all congressional districts in Orange County, Republicans maintained a lead in voter registration numbers, although it shrunk to less than a percentage point as of February 10, 2019,&lt;ref name=&quot;voterstats&quot; /&gt; as compared with over 10% on February 10, 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;CA-SS&quot; /&gt; The number of registered Democrats surpassed the number of registered Republicans in the county in August 2019.

Seven out of the 12 state legislators from Orange County are also Republicans.

===Political history===
Orange County has long been known as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] stronghold and has consistently sent Republican representatives to the state and federal legislatures — so strongly so, that [[Ronald Reagan]] described it as the place that &quot;all the good Republicans go to die.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ARELLANO&quot;/&gt;  Republican majorities in Orange County helped deliver California's electoral votes to Republican nominees [[Richard Nixon]] in 1960, 1968, and 1972; [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976; Reagan in 1980 and 1984; and [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1988. It was one of five counties in the state that voted for [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964.

In [[1936 United States presidential election in California|1936]], Orange County gave [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] a majority of its presidential vote. The Republican nominee won Orange County in the next 19 presidential elections, until Hillary Clinton won the county with a majority in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm|title=2016 Presidential General Election|website=Ocvote.com|access-date=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-oc-clinton-20161109-story.html|title=Hillary Clinton turned Orange County blue.

The Republican margin began to narrow in the 1990s and 2000s as the state trended Democratic until the mid- to late-2010s when it voted for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in [[2016 United States presidential election in California|2016]] and the Democratic Party managed to gain all seven Congressional districts in the county, including all four districts anchored in the county, in the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections in California|2018]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hannon |first1=Elliot |title=Democrat Declared Winner in Orange County House Race, Marking a Clean Democratic Sweep of the Onetime Conservative Stronghold |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/democrat-cisneros-young-kim-winner-flip-orange-county-house-congress-race-sweep.html |website=Slate |publisher=The Washington Post Group |access-date=November 18, 2018 |language=en |quote=Democrat Declared Winner in Orange County House Race, Marking a Clean Democratic Sweep of the Onetime Conservative Stronghold By Elliot Hannon Nov 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted media outlets to declare Orange County's Republican leanings &quot;dead&quot;, with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' running an [[op-ed]] titled, &quot;An obituary to old Orange County, dead at age 129.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ARELLANO&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-arellano-orange-county-obit-20181107-story.html |title=An obituary for old Orange County, dead at age 129 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=GUSTAVO |last=ARELLANO

According to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Orange County has 1,591,543 registered voters. Of these, 34% (541,711) are registered Republicans, and 33.3% (529,651) are registered Democrats. An additional 28.5% (453,343) declined to state a political party.&lt;ref name=&quot;voterstats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-odd-year-2019/politicalsub.pdf|title=Report of Registration Odd-Number Year Report by political subdivision|date=February 10, 2019|publisher=California Secretary of State|access-date=June 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orange County has produced such notable Republicans as President [[Richard Nixon]] (born in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] and lived in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]]), U.S. Senator [[John F. Seymour]] (previously [[mayor of Anaheim, California|mayor of Anaheim]]), and U.S. Senator [[Thomas Kuchel]] (of Anaheim). Former Congressman [[Christopher Cox]] (of Newport Beach), a White House counsel for President Reagan, is also a former chairman of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Orange County was also home to former Republican Congressman [[John G. Schmitz]], a presidential candidate in 1972 from the ultra-conservative [[American Independent Party]] and the father of [[Mary Kay Letourneau]]. In 1996, [[Curt Pringle]] (later mayor of Anaheim) became the first Republican Speaker of the [[California State Assembly]] in decades.

While the growth of the county's [[Hispanic]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] populations in recent decades has significantly influenced Orange County's culture, its conservative reputation has remained largely intact. Partisan voter registration patterns of Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic minorities in the county have tended to reflect the surrounding demographics, with resultant Republican majorities in all but the central portion of the county. When [[Loretta Sanchez]], a [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog Democrat]], defeated veteran Republican [[Bob Dornan]] in 1996, she was continuing a trend of Democratic representation of that district that had been interrupted by Dornan's 1984 upset of former Congressman [[Jerry M. Patterson|Jerry Patterson]]. Until 1992, Sanchez herself was a moderate Republican, and she is viewed as somewhat more moderate than other Democrats from Southern California.

In 2004, [[George W. Bush]] captured 60% of the county's vote, up from 56% in 2000 despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide. Although [[Barbara Boxer]] won statewide, and fared better in Orange County than she did in 1998, Republican [[Bill Jones (California politician)|Bill Jones]] defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% that [[John Kerry]] received is higher than the percentage [[Bill Clinton]] won in 1992 or 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 (60%) is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] won 45% of the vote in the county, the best showing of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only [[Coastal California]] county to vote for her Republican opponent, [[Dick Mountjoy]].

The county is featured prominently in Lisa McGirr's book ''Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right''. She argues that its conservative political orientation in the 20th century owed much to its settlement by farmers from the [[Great Plains]], who reacted strongly to communist sympathies, the [[civil rights movement]], and the turmoil of the 1960s in nearby Los Angeles — across the &quot;[[Orange Curtain]]&quot;.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Orange County was one of California's leading Republican voting blocs and a subculture of residents with &quot;Middle American&quot; values that emphasized capitalist religious morality{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in contrast to [[San Francisco values|West coast liberalism]].

Orange County has many Republican voters from culturally conservative [[Asian Americans|Asian-American]], [[Middle Eastern Americans|Middle Eastern]] and Latino immigrant groups. The large [[Vietnamese Americans|Vietnamese-American]] communities in [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]] and [[Westminster, California|Westminster]] are predominantly Republican; Vietnamese Americans registered Republicans outnumber those registered as Democrats, 55% to 22% as of 2007, while as of 2017 that figure is 42% to 36%. Republican Assemblyman [[Van Tran]] was the first Vietnamese-American elected to a state legislature and joined with Texan [[Hubert Vo]] as the highest-ranking elected Vietnamese-American in the United States until the 2008 election of [[Joseph Cao]] in [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]]. In the 2007 special election for the vacant county supervisor seat following Democrat [[Lou Correa]]'s election to the state senate, two Vietnamese-American Republican candidates topped the list of 10 candidates, separated from each other by only seven votes, making the [[Orange County Board of Supervisors]] entirely Republican; Correa is first of only two Democrats to have served on the Board since 1987 and only the fifth since 1963.

Even with the Democratic sweep of Orange County's congressional seats in 2018, as well as a steady trend of Democratic gains in voter registration, the county remains very Republican downballot. In much of the county, the district's congressperson is the only elected Democrat above the county level, and in some cases the only elected Democrat above the municipal level. Generally, larger cities–those with a population over 100,000, such as Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine - feature a registration advantage for Democrats, while the other municipalities still have a Republican voter registration advantage. This is especially true in Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, and Villa Park, the three cities where the Republican advantage is largest. As of February 10, 2019, the only exceptions to the former are Huntington Beach and Orange, while exceptions to the latter include Buena Park, Laguna Beach and Stanton.&lt;ref name=&quot;voterstats&quot; /&gt;

In October 1966, Mao convened a &quot;Central Work Conference&quot;, mostly to convince those in the party leadership who had not yet adopted revolutionary ideology. Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping were prosecuted as part of a [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[reactionary]] line (''zichanjieji fandong luxian'') and begrudgingly gave self-criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar &amp; Schoenhals; p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; After the conference, Liu, once a powerful moderate pundit of the ruling class, was placed under house arrest in Beijing, then sent to a detention camp, where he was denied medical treatment and died in 1969. Deng Xiaoping was sent away for a period of re-education three times and was eventually sent to work in an engine factory in [[Jiangxi]] province.

===Radicals seized power (1967)===
{{See also|Seizure of power (Cultural Revolution)|Violent Struggle}}
Mass organisations in China coalesced into two hostile factions, the radicals who backed Mao's purge of the Communist party, and the conservatives who backed the moderate party establishment. At his birthday party on 26 December 1966, Mao declared an &quot;All-round civil war&quot; to resolve the standoff and asked the military forces of PLA to support &quot;the Left,&quot; which was however not clearly defined. As the PLA commanders had developed close working relations with the party establishment, many military units worked instead to repress Mao's radicals.&lt;ref name=war/&gt;

Spurred by the events in Beijing, '[[Seizure of power (Cultural Revolution)|power seizure]]' (''duoquan'') groups formed all over the country and began expanding into factories and the countryside. In Shanghai, a young factory worker named [[Wang Hongwen]] organized a far-reaching revolutionary coalition, one that galvanized and displaced existing Red Guard groups. On January 3, 1967, with support from CRG heavyweights Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, the group of firebrand activists overthrew the Shanghai municipal government under [[Chen Pixian]] in what became known as the &quot;[[January Storm]],&quot; and formed in its place the [[Shanghai People's Commune]].&lt;ref&gt;Yan, Jiaqi.  Gao, Gao.  [1996] (1996). Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution. {{ISBN|0-8248-1695-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The events in Shanghai were praised by Mao, who encouraged similar activities across China. Provincial governments and many parts of the state and party bureaucracy were affected, with power seizures taking place in a remarkably different fashion. [[Revolutionary committee (China)|''Revolutionary committees'']] were subsequently established, in place of local governments and branches of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bridgham|first=Philip|date=1968|title=Mao's Cultural Revolution in 1967: The Struggle to Seize Power|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=34|issue=34|pages=6–37|doi=10.1017/S0305741000014417|jstor=651368|issn=0305-7410}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Beijing, three separate revolutionary groups declared power seizures on the same day, while in Heilongjiang, the local party secretary [[Pan Fusheng]] managed to &quot;seize power&quot; from the party organization under his own leadership. Some leaders even wrote the CRG asking to be overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;MacFaquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 170–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Beijing, Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao made a target out of Vice-Premier [[Tao Zhu]]. The [[Seizure of power (Cultural Revolution)|power-seizure movement]] was rearing its head in the military as well. In February, prominent generals [[Ye Jianying]] and [[Chen Yi (general)|Chen Yi]], as well as Vice-Premier [[Tan Zhenlin]], vocally asserted their opposition to the more extreme aspects of the movement, with some party elders insinuating that the CRG's real motives were to remove the revolutionary old guard. Mao, initially ambivalent, took to the Politburo floor on February 18 to denounce the opposition directly, giving a full-throated endorsement to the radicals' activities. This short-lived resistance was branded the &quot;[[February Countercurrent]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MacFaquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;—effectively silencing critics of the movement within the party in the years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Nianyi|title=大动乱的年代：1949–1989 年的中国 [Great age of turmoil, a history of China 1949–89]|pages=207–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While revolutionaries dismantled ruling government and party organizations all over the country, because power seizures lacked centralized leadership, it was no longer clear who truly believed in Mao's revolutionary vision and who was opportunistically exploiting the chaos for their own gain. The formation of rival revolutionary groups, some manifestations of long-established local feuds, led to factional [[Violent Struggle|violent struggles]] across the country. Tension grew between mass organizations and the military as well. In response, Lin Biao issued a directive for the army to aid the radicals. At the same time, the army took control of some provinces and locales that were deemed incapable of sorting out their own power transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Nianyi|title=大动乱的年代：1949–1989 年的中国 [Great age of turmoil, a history of China 1949–89]|pages=219–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the central city of Wuhan, like in many other cities, two major revolutionary organizations emerged, one supporting the conservative establishment and the other opposed to it. The groups fought over the control of the city. [[Chen Zaidao]], the Army general in charge of the area, forcibly repressed the anti-establishment demonstrators who were backed by Mao. However, during the commotion, Mao himself flew to Wuhan with a large entourage of central officials in an attempt to secure military loyalty in the area. On July 20, 1967, local agitators in response kidnapped Mao's emissary [[Wang Li (politician)|Wang Li]] in what became known as the [[Wuhan Incident]]. Subsequently, Gen. Chen Zaidao was sent to Beijing and tried by Jiang Qing and the rest of the Cultural Revolution Group. Chen's resistance was the last major open display of opposition to the movement within the army.&lt;ref&gt;MacFaquhar and Schoenhals, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gang of Four's [[Zhang Chunqiao]], himself, admitted that the most crucial factor in the Cultural Revolution was not the Red Guards or the Cultural Revolution Group or the &quot;rebel worker&quot; organisations, but the side on which the PLA stood. When the PLA local garrison supported Mao's radicals, they were able to take over the local government successfully, but if they were not cooperative, the seizures of power were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacFarquhar |first1=Roderick |last2=Schoenhals |first2=Michael |title=Mao's Last Revolution |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674040410 |page=175 |edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent clashes occurred in virtually all cities, according to one historian. In response to the Wuhan Incident, Mao and Jiang Qing began establishing a &quot;workers' armed self-defence force&quot;, a &quot;revolutionary armed force of mass character&quot; to counter what he estimated as rightism in &quot;75% of the PLA officer corps.&quot; Chongqing city, a center of arms manufacturing, was the site of ferocious armed clashes between the two factions, with one construction site in the city estimated to involve 10,000 combatants with tanks, mobile artillery, anti-aircraft guns and &quot;virtually every kind of conventional weapon.&quot; Ten thousand artillery shells were fired in Chongqing during August 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacFarquhar |first1=Roderick |last2=Schoenhals |first2=Michael |title=Mao's Last Revolution |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674040410 |pages=214–215, 217 |edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide, a total of 18.77&amp;nbsp;million firearms, 14,828 artillery pieces, 2,719,545 grenades ended up in civilian hands and used in the course of [[Violent Struggle|''violent struggles'']] which mostly took place from 1967 to 1968; in the cities of [[Chongqing]], [[Xiamen]], and [[Changchun]], tanks, armoured vehicles and even warships were deployed in combat.&lt;ref name=war&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Song|first1=Yongyi|date=2011|title=Chronology of Mass Killings during the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966–1976)|url=https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/chronology-mass-killings-during-chinese-cultural-revolution-1966-1976|url-status=live|journal=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence|issn=1961-9898|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425062821/https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/chronology-mass-killings-during-chinese-cultural-revolution-1966-1976|archive-date=April 25, 2019|access-date=April 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political purges and &quot;Down to the Countryside&quot; (1968) ===

[[File:SZ 深圳博物館 Shenzhen Museum 深圳改革開放前歷史展廳 Before Reform and Opening-up History IX1 Anti-Liu Shaoqi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Anti-[[Liu Shaoqi]] rally]]
In May 1968, Mao launched the massive &quot;Cleansing the Class Ranks&quot; [[Political purges during and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests|political purge]] in [[mainland China]]. Many were sent to the [[Rural society in China|countryside]] to work in reeducation camps.

On July 27, 1968, the [[Red Guards]]' power over the Army was officially ended, and the establishment government sent in units to [[besiege]] areas that remained untouched by the Guards. A year later, the Red Guard factions were dismantled entirely; Mao predicted that the chaos might begin running its own agenda and be tempted to turn against revolutionary ideology. Their purpose had been largely fulfilled; Mao and his radical colleagues had largely overturned establishment power.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Liu was expelled from the Communist Party at the 12th Plenum of the [[8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Eighth Central Committee]] in September 1968, and labelled the &quot;headquarters of the bourgeoisie,&quot; seemingly alluding to Mao's ''[[Bombard the Headquarters]]'' ''[[Big-character poster|dazibao]]'' written two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Liu Shaoqi rehabilitated|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-5/lrs-liu.htm|access-date=2020-06-10|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Down to the Countryside Movement (Dec.) ====
In December 1968, Mao began the &quot;Down to the Countryside Movement.&quot; During this movement, which lasted for the next decade, young bourgeoisie living in cities were ordered to go to the countryside to experience working life. The term &quot;young intellectuals&quot; was used to refer to recently graduated college students. In the late 1970s, these students returned to their home cities. Many students who were previously Red Guard members supported the movement and Mao's vision. This movement was thus in part a means of moving Red Guards from the cities to the countryside, where they would cause less social disruption. It also served to spread revolutionary ideology across China geographically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2PVYI4kAtQC&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Made In China: What Western Managers Can Learn from Trailblazing Chinese Entrepreneurs |author= Donald N.

In the spring of 1968, a massive campaign that aimed at [[Mao Zedong's cult of personality|enhancing Mao's reputation]] began. A notable example was the &quot;mango fever.&quot; On August 4, 1968, Mao was presented with about 40 [[mango]]es by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Pakistani foreign minister]], [[Sharifuddin Pirzada|Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada]],&lt;!-- Name not mentioned in sources but dates appear to be correct --&gt; in an apparent diplomatic gesture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murck2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfreda Murck|title=Mao's Golden Mangoes and the Cultural Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mymWMQEACAAJ|year=2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-3-85881-732-7|access-date=September 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228032644/https://books.google.com/books?id=mymWMQEACAAJ|archive-date=February 28, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao had his aide send the box of mangoes to his Mao Zedong Propaganda Team at [[Tsinghua University]] on August 5, the team stationed there to quiet strife among Red Guard factions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walder2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew G.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the afternoon of the fifth, when the great happy news of Chairman Mao giving mangoes to the Capital Worker and Peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team reached the Tsinghua University campus, people immediately gathered around the gift given by the Great Leader Chairman Mao. They cried out enthusiastically and sang with wild abandonment.

One of the mangoes was sent to the Beijing Textile Factory,&lt;ref name=&quot;Walder2015&quot; /&gt; whose [[Revolutionary committee (China)|revolutionary committee]] organised a rally in the mangoes' honour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schrift2001&quot; /&gt; Workers read out quotations from Mao and celebrated the gift. Altars were erected to display the fruit prominently; when the mango peel began to rot after a few days, the fruit was peeled and boiled in a pot of water. Workers then filed by and each was given a spoonful of mango water. The revolutionary committee also made a wax replica of the mango and displayed this as a centrepiece in the factory. There followed several months of &quot;mango fever,&quot; as the fruit became a focus of a &quot;boundless loyalty&quot; campaign for Chairman Mao. More replica mangoes were created, and the replicas were sent on tour around Beijing and elsewhere in China. Many revolutionary committees visited the mangoes in Beijing from outlying provinces; approximately half a million people greeted the replicas when they arrived in [[Chengdu]]. Badges and wall posters featuring the mangoes and Mao were produced in the millions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walder2015&quot; /&gt;

The fruit was shared among all institutions that had been a part of the propaganda team, and large processions were organised in support of the ''zhengui lipin'' (&quot;precious gift&quot;), as the mangoes were known as.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leese2011&quot;&gt;{{citation|author=Daniel Leese|title=Mao Cult: Rhetoric and Ritual in China's Cultural Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqjviY6aFloC&amp;pg=PA221|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49811-1|pages=221–22|access-date=September 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228032642/https://books.google.com/books?id=iqjviY6aFloC&amp;pg=PA221|archive-date=February 28, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; One dentist in a small town, Dr. Han, saw the mango and said it was nothing special and looked just like [[sweet potato]]; he was put on trial for malicious [[Defamation|slander]], found guilty, paraded publicly throughout the town, and then executed with one shot to the head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2013&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/the-mao-mango-cult-of-1968/|title=The Mao Mango Cult of 1968 and the Rise of China's Working Class|last1=Marks|first1=Ben|website=Collectors Weekly|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105161815/https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/the-mao-mango-cult-of-1968/|archive-date=November 5, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that Mao used the mangoes to express support for the workers who would go to whatever lengths necessary to end the factional fighting among students, and a &quot;prime example of Mao's strategy of symbolic support.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schrift2001&quot; /&gt; Even up until early 1969, participants of [[Mao-Zedong-Thought]] study classes in Beijing would return with mass-produced mango [[facsimiles]] and still gain media attention in the provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leese2011&quot; /&gt;

== Lin Biao phase (1969–71) ==

===Transition of power (Apr. 1969)===
The [[Ninth Congress of the CPC|Ninth Party Congress]] was held in April 1969 and served as a means to &quot;revitalize&quot; the party with fresh thinking and new cadres after much of the old guard had been destroyed in the struggles of preceding years.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; The institutional framework of the Party established two decades earlier had broken down almost entirely: delegates for this Congress were effectively selected by [[Revolutionary committee (China)|Revolutionary Committees]] rather than through election by party members.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Representation of the military increased by a large margin from the previous Congress (28% of the delegates were PLA members), and the election of more PLA members to the new Central Committee reflected this increase.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Many military officers elevated to senior positions were loyal to PLA Marshal Lin Biao, opening a new factional divide between the military and civilian leadership.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals.

Lin Biao was officially elevated to become the Party's number-two figure, with his name written into the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party's Constitution]] as Mao's &quot;closest comrade-in-arms&quot; and &quot;universally recognized successor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 291. At the time, no other Communist parties or governments anywhere in the world had adopted the practice of enshrining a successor to the current leader into their constitutions; this practice was unique to China.&lt;/ref&gt; Lin delivered the [[keynote]] address at the Congress: a document drafted by hardliner leftists Yao Wenyuan and [[Zhang Chunqiao]] under Mao's guidance.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was heavily critical of Liu Shaoqi and other &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; and drew extensively from quotations in the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong|Little Red Book]]. The Congress solidified the central role of Maoism within the party psyche, re-introducing [[Maoism]] as an official guiding ideology of the party in the party constitution. Lastly, the Congress elected a new Politburo with Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, Chen Boda, Zhou Enlai, and Kang Sheng as the members of the new [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]]. Lin, Chen, and Kang were all beneficiaries of the Cultural Revolution. Zhou, who was demoted in rank, voiced his unequivocal support for Lin at the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao also restored the function of some formal party institutions, such as the operations of the party's Politburo, which ceased functioning between 1966 and 1968 because the Central Cultural Revolution Group held ''[[de facto]]'' control of the country.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

===PLA gains pre-eminent role (1970)===
[[File:Lin Biao.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Marshal [[Lin Biao]] was constitutionally confirmed as Mao's successor in 1969.]]
Mao's efforts at re-organizing party and state institutions generated mixed results. Many far-flung provinces remained volatile as the political situation in Beijing stabilized. Factional struggles, many of which were violent, continued at the local level despite the declaration that the [[9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Ninth Congress]] marked a temporary &quot;victory&quot; for the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, despite Mao's efforts to put on a show of unity at the Congress, the factional divide between Lin Biao's PLA camp and the Jiang Qing–led radical camp was intensifying. Indeed, a personal dislike of [[Jiang Qing]] drew many civilian leaders, including prominent theoretician Chen Boda, closer to Lin Biao.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1966 and 1968, China was isolated internationally, having declared its enmity towards both the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States. The friction with the Soviet Union intensified after [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|border clashes]] on the [[Ussuri River]] in March 1969 as the Chinese leadership prepared for all-out war.&lt;ref name=m317&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; In October, senior leaders were evacuated from Beijing.&lt;ref name=m317/&gt; Amidst the tension, Lin Biao issued what appeared to be an executive order to prepare for war to the PLA's eleven [[Military regions of the People's Liberation Army|Military Regions]] on October 18 without passing through Mao. This drew the ire of the Chairman, who saw it as evidence that his authority was prematurely usurped by his declared successor.&lt;ref name=m317/&gt;

The prospect of war elevated the PLA to greater prominence in domestic politics, increasing the stature of Lin Biao at the expense of Mao.&lt;ref name=m321&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence to suggest that Mao was pushed to seek closer relations with the United States as a means to avoid PLA dominance in domestic affairs that would result from a military confrontation with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=m321/&gt; During his [[1972 Nixon visit to China|meeting]] with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972, Mao hinted that Lin had opposed seeking better relations with the U.S.&lt;ref name=m322&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restoration of State Chairman ====
After Lin was confirmed as Mao's successor, his supporters focused on the restoration of the position of [[President of the People's Republic of China|State Chairman]] (President),&lt;ref&gt;This position, effectively China's [[head of state]], has been called &quot;President&quot; since 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; which had been abolished by Mao after the purge of Liu Shaoqi. They hoped that by allowing Lin to ease into a constitutionally sanctioned role, whether Chairman or Vice-Chairman, Lin's succession would be institutionalized. The consensus within the [[Politburo]] was that Mao should assume the office with Lin becoming Vice-Chairman; but for unknown reasons, Mao had voiced his explicit opposition to the recreation of the position and his assuming it.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Factional rivalries intensified at the Second Plenum of the Ninth Congress in Lushan held in late August 1970. [[Chen Boda]], now aligned with the PLA faction loyal to Lin, galvanized support for the restoration of the office of President of China, despite Mao's wishes to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Chen launched an assault on Zhang Chunqiao, a staunch Maoist who embodied the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, over the evaluation of Mao's legacy.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks on Zhang found favour with many attendees at the Plenum and may have been construed by Mao as an indirect attack on the Cultural Revolution itself. Mao confronted Chen openly, denouncing him as a &quot;false Marxist,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;m332&quot;&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; and removed him from the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]]. In addition to the purge of Chen, Mao asked Lin's principal generals to write self-criticisms on their political positions as a warning to Lin. Mao also inducted several of his supporters to the Central Military Commission and placed his loyalists in leadership roles of the [[Beijing Military Region]].&lt;ref name=&quot;m332&quot; /&gt;

===Flight of Lin Biao (Sept. 1971)===
{{Main|Lin Biao incident}}
[[File:Huayangpalace layers 2007 09.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Graffiti with Lin Biao's foreword to Mao's Little Red Book, Lin's name (lower right) was later scratched out, presumably after his death.]]

By 1971, diverging interests between the civilian and military wings of the leadership were apparent. Mao was troubled by the PLA's newfound prominence, and the purge of Chen Boda marked the beginning of a gradual scaling-down of the PLA's political involvement.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; According to official sources, sensing the reduction of Lin's power base and his declining health, Lin's supporters plotted to use the military power still at their disposal to oust Mao in a coup.&lt;ref name=jin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Qiu|first1=Jin|title=The Culture of Power: The Lin Biao Incident in the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Standard University Press|location=Stanford, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin's son, [[Lin Liguo]], and other high-ranking military conspirators formed a coup apparatus in Shanghai and dubbed the plan to oust Mao by force ''[[Project 571 Outline|Outline for Project 571]]'', which sounds similar to &quot;Military Uprising&quot; in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. It is disputed whether Lin Biao was involved in this process. While official sources maintain that Lin planned and executed the alleged coup attempt, scholars such as Jin Qiu portray Lin as a passive character manipulated by members of his family and his supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;jin&quot;/&gt; Qiu contests that Lin Biao was never personally involved in drafting the ''Outline'' and evidence suggests that Lin Liguo drafted the coup.&lt;ref name=jin/&gt;

The ''Outline'' allegedly consisted mainly of plans for aerial bombardments through use of the Air Force. It initially targeted Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, but would later involve Mao himself. If the plan succeeded, Lin would arrest his political rivals and assume power. Assassination attempts were alleged to have been made against Mao in Shanghai, from September 8 to September 10, 1971. Perceived risks to Mao's safety were allegedly relayed to the Chairman. One internal report alleged that Lin had planned to bomb a bridge that Mao was to cross to reach Beijing; Mao reportedly avoided this bridge after receiving intelligence reports.

==== Death ====
In the official narrative, on September 13, 1971, Lin Biao, his wife [[Ye Qun]], Lin Liguo, and members of his staff attempted to flee to the [[Soviet Union]] ostensibly to [[Asylum seeker|seek asylum]]. En route, Lin's plane crashed in [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], killing all on board. The plane apparently ran out of fuel en route to the Soviet Union. A Soviet team investigating the incident was not able to determine the cause of the crash but hypothesized that the pilot was flying low to evade radar and misjudged the plane's altitude.

The official account has been put to question by foreign scholars, who have raised doubts over Lin's choice of the Soviet Union as a destination, the plane's route, the identity of the passengers, and whether or not a coup was actually taking place.&lt;ref name=&quot;jin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannam and Lawrence 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, the Politburo met in an emergency session to discuss Lin Biao. Only on September 30 was Lin's death confirmed in Beijing, which led to the cancellation of the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]] celebration events the following day. The Central Committee kept information under wraps, and news of Lin's death was not released to the public until two months following the incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;jin&quot;/&gt; Many of Lin's supporters sought refuge in Hong Kong; those who remained on the mainland were purged. The event caught the party leadership off guard: the concept that Lin could betray Mao de-legitimized a vast body of Cultural Revolution political rhetoric, as Lin was already enshrined into the Party Constitution as Mao's &quot;closest comrade-in-arms&quot; and &quot;successor.&quot; For several months following the incident, the party information apparatus struggled to find a &quot;correct way&quot; to frame the incident for public consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;jin&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Gang of Four}}

===Antagonism towards Zhou and Deng (1972–73)===
[[File:1967-03 1966年12月26日江青周恩来康生接见红卫兵.jpg|thumb|[[Jiang Qing]] (left), who was the wife of Mao Zedong and a member of the [[Gang of Four]], received the [[Red Guards]] in Beijing with Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] (center) and [[Kang Sheng]]. They were all holding the [[Little red book|''Little Red Book'']] (''Quotations from Mao'') in their hands.|alt=|left]]
Mao became depressed and reclusive after the Lin Biao incident. With Lin gone, Mao had no ready answers for who would succeed him. Sensing a sudden loss of direction, Mao attempted reaching out to old comrades whom he had denounced in the past. Meanwhile, in September 1972, Mao transferred a 38-year-old cadre from Shanghai, [[Wang Hongwen]], to Beijing and made him Vice-Chairman of the Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;mac357&quot;&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang, a former factory worker from a peasant background,&lt;ref name=&quot;mac357&quot; /&gt; was seemingly being groomed for succession.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jiang Qing]]'s position also strengthened after Lin's flight. She held tremendous influence with the radical camp. With Mao's health on the decline, it was clear that Jiang Qing had political ambitions of her own. She allied herself with Wang Hongwen and propaganda specialists [[Zhang Chunqiao]] and [[Yao Wenyuan]], forming a political clique later pejoratively dubbed as the &quot;[[Gang of Four]]&quot;.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

By 1973, round after round of political struggles had left many lower-level institutions, including local government, factories, and railways, short of competent staff needed to carry out basic functions.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; The country's economy had fallen into disarray, which necessitated the rehabilitation of purged lower-level officials. However, the party's core became heavily dominated by Cultural Revolution beneficiaries and leftist radicals, whose focus remained to uphold ideological purity over economic productivity. The economy remained the domain of [[Zhou Enlai]] mostly, one of the few moderates 'left standing'. Zhou attempted to restore a viable economy but was resented by the Gang of Four, who identified him as their primary political threat in post-Mao era succession.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In late 1973, to weaken Zhou's political position and to distance themselves from Lin's apparent betrayal, the &quot;[[Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius]]&quot; campaign began under Jiang Qing's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated goals were to purge China of [[New Confucianism|new Confucianist]] thinking and denounce Lin Biao's actions as traitorous and regressive.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Reminiscent of the first years of the Cultural Revolution, the battle was carried out through historical [[allegory]], and although Zhou Enlai's name was never mentioned during this campaign, the Premier's historical namesake, the [[Duke of Zhou]], was a frequent target.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

==== Deng's rehabilitation and economic reconstruction (1975) ====
With a fragile economy and Zhou falling ill to cancer, Deng Xiaoping returned to the political scene, taking up the post of Vice-Premier in March 1973, in the first of a series of promotions approved by Mao. After Zhou withdrew from active politics in January 1975, Deng was effectively put in charge of the government, party, and military, earning the additional titles of [[People's Liberation Army General Staff Department|PLA General Chief of Staff]], Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party, and Vice-Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] in a short time span.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

The speed of Deng's rehabilitation took the radical camp, who saw themselves as Mao's 'rightful' political and ideological heirs, by surprise. Mao wanted to use Deng as a counterweight to the military faction in government to suppress any remaining influence of those formerly loyal to Lin Biao. In addition, Mao had also lost confidence in the ability of the Gang of Four to manage the economy and saw Deng as a competent and effective leader. Leaving the country in grinding poverty would do no favours to the positive legacy of the Cultural Revolution, which Mao worked hard to protect. Deng's return set the scene for a protracted factional struggle between the radical Gang of Four and moderates led by Zhou and Deng.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

At the time, Jiang Qing and associates held effective control of [[mass media]] and the party's [[Propaganda in China|propaganda]] network, while Zhou and Deng held control of most government organs. On some decisions, Mao sought to mitigate the Gang's influence, but on others, he acquiesced to their demands. The Gang of Four's heavy hand in political and media control did not prevent Deng from reinstating his economic policies. Deng emphatically opposed Party factionalism, and his policies aimed to promote unity as the first step to restoring economic productivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, Chapter 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like the post-[[Great Leap Forward|Great Leap]] restructuring led by [[Liu Shaoqi]], Deng streamlined the [[Rail transport in China|railway system]], [[Steel industry in China|steel production]], and other vital areas of the economy. By late 1975, however, Mao saw that Deng's economic restructuring might negate the legacy of the Cultural Revolution, and launched a campaign to oppose &quot;rehabilitating the case for the rightists,&quot; alluding to Deng as the country's foremost &quot;rightist.&quot; Mao directed Deng to write self-criticisms in November 1975, a move lauded by the Gang of Four.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

===Death of Zhou Enlai (early 1976)===
On January 8, 1976, [[Zhou Enlai]] died of [[bladder cancer]]. On January 15 [[Deng Xiaoping]] delivered Zhou's official [[eulogy]] in a funeral attended by all of China's most senior leaders with the notable absence of Mao himself, who had grown increasingly critical of Zhou.&lt;ref&gt;Teiwes and Sun 217–218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spence 610&lt;/ref&gt; After Zhou's death, Mao selected neither a member of the Gang of Four nor Deng to become Premier, instead choosing the relatively unknown [[Hua Guofeng]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tprrCQAAQBAJ&amp;q=after+Zhou's+death,+Mao+selected+neither+a+member+of+the+Gang+of+Four+nor+Deng+Xiaoping+to+become+Premier,+instead+choosing+the+relatively+unknown+Hua+Guofeng.&amp;pg=PT490|title=The Life/Death Rhythms of Capitalist Regimes - Debt Before Dishonour: Timetable of World Dominance 1400-2100|last1=Slatyer|first1=Will|date=2015-02-20|publisher=Partridge Publishing Singapore|isbn=9781482829617|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gang of Four grew apprehensive that spontaneous, large-scale popular support for Zhou could turn the political tide against them. They acted through the media to impose a set of restrictions on overt public displays of mourning for Zhou. Years of resentment over the Cultural Revolution, the public persecution of Deng Xiaoping (seen as Zhou's ally), and the prohibition against public mourning led to a rise in popular discontent against Mao and the Gang of Four.&lt;ref name=&quot;TS1&quot;&gt;Tiewes and Sun, 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Official attempts to enforce the mourning restrictions included removing public memorials and tearing down posters commemorating Zhou's achievements. On March 25, 1976, Shanghai's ''[[Wen Hui Bao]]'' published an article calling Zhou &quot;the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] roader inside the Party [who] wanted to help the unrepentant capitalist roader [Deng] regain his power.&quot; These propaganda efforts at smearing Zhou's image, however, only strengthened public attachment to Zhou's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Teiwes and Sun 214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiananmen Incident (Apr. 1976)===
{{Main|Tiananmen Incident}}
[[File:Jiang Qing 1976.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Jiang Qing]]
On April 4, 1976, on the eve of China's annual [[Qingming Festival]], a traditional day of mourning, thousands of people gathered around the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] in [[Tiananmen Square]] to commemorate Zhou Enlai. The people of Beijing honored Zhou by laying wreaths, banners, poems, placards, and flowers at the foot of the Monument.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiananmen1&quot; /&gt; The most apparent purpose of this memorial was to eulogize Zhou, but the Gang of Four were also attacked for their actions against the Premier. A small number of slogans left at Tiananmen even attacked Mao himself, and his Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;TS2&quot;&gt;Teiwes and Sun 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to two million people may have visited Tiananmen Square on April 4.&lt;ref name=&quot;TS2&quot;/&gt; All levels of society, from the most impoverished peasants to high-ranking PLA officers and the children of high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities. Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of anger over the treatment of Zhou, revolt against the Cultural Revolution and apprehension for China's future. The event did not appear to have coordinated leadership but rather seemed to be a reflection of public sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Teiwes and Sun 119–220&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there are some impressive ducal country residences around Weimar. They are marked by their beautiful parks and gardens. [[Schloss Belvedere, Weimar|Schloss Belvedere]], south-east of Weimar was built between 1724 and 1732 in Baroque style with an orangery near to a ducal hunting forest. North-east of Weimar, at [[Ettersburg]] lies another ducal hunting lodge next to the Ettersberg mountain and its forest. It was established between 1706 and 1711 also in Baroque style. The third summer residence, [[Schloss Tiefurt]], is located in [[Tiefurt]], north-east of Weimar. The small lodge in a wide park in Ilm valley was rebuilt in 1775 in late-Baroque forms.

==== Other sights ====
* The town hall at Marktplatz was built between 1837 and 1841 in Neo-Gothic style by ''Heinrich Heß'' after the former one (15th-century) burnt down. 
* The two main buildings of [[Bauhaus University, Weimar|Bauhaus University]] at Marienstraße are icons of 20th-century early-modern architecture. Both were built by [[Henry van de Velde]] between 1904 and 1911. They mark the transition from older Historicism and Art Nouveau to the new international modern style in Germany by their functional forms (e. g. skylights for better working conditions inside). 
* The German National Theatre at Theaterplatz was built in 1906/07 in neo-classicist forms. Two predecessors were in use after 1779 and 1825 as ducal court theatres during Weimar's golden age. In 1919, the [[Weimar National Assembly]] developed the Weimar Constitution in this theatre.
* The ''Gauforum'' at Weimarplatz is a Roman-fascist style representative government district between the city centre and the main station. This Gauforum, designed by [[Hermann Giesler]], was the only realized Nazi government district outside Berlin (whereas there were plans for all German state capitals). Today it hosts the Thuringian Administration State Department.
* The ''[[Park an der Ilm]]'' is the city's largest park along [[Ilm (Thuringia)|Ilm]] river between the ducal palace and the district of Oberweimar. It was established between 1778 and 1833 and is an [[English landscape garden]] today, part of UNESCO world heritage. Sights inside the park are ''Goethe's garden house'' (1690s) and ''Römisches Haus'' (in the style of a Roman temple, 1790s). 
* The Historic Cemetery at Karl-Haußknecht-Straße was opened in 1818 and hosts the graves of Goethe, Schiller and many other famous people from Weimar. 
* The ''Goethe-Schiller-Denkmal'' at Theaterplatz is the most famous memorial in Weimar. It was made by [[Ernst Rietschel]] between 1852 and 1857 and is dedicated to Goethe and Schiller, the most important poets of German classical literature.
* A rather unknown monument is the Lenin-light-box inside the theatre hall &quot;La Redoute&quot;. It's a copy of a stained window by Alexander Leonidovich Korolev that shows Lenin in Petrograd. (today: St. Petersburg).&lt;ref&gt;https://leninisstillaround.com/2017/03/14/the-light-box/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Events ===
The Onion Market (Weimarer Zwiebelmarkt) is an annual festival held in October in Weimar and it is Thuringia's largest festival. The festival is held over 3&amp;nbsp;days and approximately 500 stalls and more than 100 stage performances are put up across the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=October 7th to 9th: the Onion Festival in Weimar|url=http://www.around-germany.com/664/october-7th-to-9th-the-onion-festival-in-weimar/|author=Festivals &amp; Concerts, Leisure|first=|date=Aug 2011|website=|publisher=AroundGermany|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825073331/http://www.around-germany.com/664/october-7th-to-9th-the-onion-festival-in-weimar/|archive-date=25 August 2011|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weimar first celebrated the Onion Market in 1653. Stalls typically offer onion plaits, themed arts and crafts and numerous onion-based foods, including onion cakes, onion soups and onion breads. The festival also hosts numerous beer gardens, live music, fairground attractions and a Ferris wheel.

There are several clubs with live music once or twice a week. There is also a [[student club]] in the city centre which also features disco and live music events on Friday- and Saturday nights (Kasseturm). There are several smaller theatre and cabaret venues other than the large &quot;DNT&quot; (Deutsches National Theater). There are four cinemas including a 3-D cinema,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130409102221/http://www.weimar-atrium.de/?page_id=1037 http://www.weimar-atrium.de/?page_id=1037]&lt;/ref&gt; and a Bowling Alley&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130225070159/http://www.weimar-atrium.de/?page_id=1038 http://www.weimar-atrium.de/?page_id=1038]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Weimar Atrium, the local mall.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
===Agriculture, industry and services ===
The area around Weimar is relatively fertile and 48% of the municipal surface are used for agricultural production. Most common agricultures are cereals, maize and rapeseed, while famous agricultural products from the Weimar region are potatoes (especially from [[Heichelheim]], {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) for dishes with [[:de:Thüringer Klöße|Thuringian dumpling]]s ([[Knödel]] from potatoes), onions (from [[Heldrungen]] and [[Oldisleben]], {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north), which are sold at Weimar Onion Market in October, and [[Saale-Unstrut]] wine from [[Bad Sulza]], {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north-east.

Industry has never been dominant in Weimar, nevertheless there were several big factories from different sectors until 1990. After reunification, nearly all factories got closed, either because they failed the adoption of free market economy or because the German government sold them to west German businessmen who closed them to avoid competition to their own enterprises.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} On the other hand, the federal government started early in the 1990s to subsidize the foundation of new companies, but it took long time before the economic situation got stabilized around 2006. Since this time, unemployment decreased and overall, new jobs develop. Today, there are many small and medium-sized companies in Weimar with electro-technics and engineering in focus. Nevertheless, settlement of new factories isn't much in focus of the local government, because it concentrates itself on developing tourism and services.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} The biggest companies with production in Weimar are [[Bayer]] (pharmaceutical factory), [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] (beverages) and [[Hydrema]] (dump truck factory). A new big commercial zone was established in the 1990s in the neighbouring municipality of [[Nohra]] with focus on logistics and distribution.

Due to its tradition as a capital, Weimar is a centre of governmental services to date. Furthermore, creative branches like media, advertising, architecture and design are important for Weimar's economy. The most important sector is tourism with 3,500 hotel beds, 350,000 visitors and 650,000 overnight stays in hotels in 2012 and a large number of German one-day visitors. Other services like retail, trade fairs and specialized hospitals are more brought by the near neighbour cities Erfurt and Jena with their infrastructure.

===Transport===
==== By rail ====
[[File:Weimar Bahnhof.jpg|thumb|[[Weimar station|Weimar Railway Station]]]]
Weimar is connected by the [[Thuringian Railway]] to [[Leipzig]] in the east and to [[Frankfurt]]/[[Kassel]] in the west. Furthermore, there are some regional railways to [[Gera]] via [[Jena]] and to [[Kranichfeld]] via [[Bad Berka]]. Today, there are long-distance trains to Frankfurt via [[Erfurt]] and [[Fulda]] and to [[Dresden]] via Leipzig and regional trains to [[Göttingen]] and [[Eisenach]] via Erfurt, to [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] via [[Naumburg (Saale)|Naumburg]], to [[Altenburg]], [[Glauchau]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Greiz]] via [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] and to Kranichfeld. When the new [[Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway]] will open (in 2015), Weimar will be disconnected from the German long-distance train network. However the regional train service will be augmented to connect Weimar with [[Intercity-Express|ICE]]-stops in Erfurt, Halle and Leipzig.

In freight transport exists an [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] terminal in Vieselbach ''(Güterverkehrszentrum/GVZ)'' with connection to rail and Autobahn, {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Weimar.

==== By road ====
Weimar is located at the [[Bundesautobahn 4]] ([[Frankfurt]]–[[Dresden]]). Furthermore, there are two federal roads to Erfurt and Jena ([[Bundesstraße 7]]) and to [[Rudolstadt]] and [[Kölleda]] ([[Bundesstraße 85]]) as well as some regional roads to [[Sömmerda]], [[Oßmannstedt]] and [[Magdala]]. A bypass road around Weimar was built in the 2000s in the north and west; the eastern and southern continuation are in discussion, but not in definite planning because of some difficulties in routing.

==== By aviation ====
The [[Erfurt-Weimar Airport]] lies approximately {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Weimar. It was largely extended in the 1990s, but the anticipated rise in passengers did not occur so that there is only rare air traffic, mostly to Mediterranean holiday regions. Other flights are carried out via [[Frankfurt Airport]], which can be reached in 3 hours, and in the future via [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]], which is scheduled to open in 2020 and is about 3 hours away.

==== By bike ====
Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. For tourism, there are the ''Ilm track'' and the ''Thuringian city string track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)''. Both connect points of tourist interest, the first along the [[Ilm (Thuringia)|Ilm]] valley from the [[Thuringian Forest]] to the [[Saale]] river and the second close to medieval [[Via Regia]] from [[Eisenach]] via [[Gotha]], [[Erfurt]], Weimar, and [[Jena]] to [[Altenburg]]. Additionally, there are themed routes like the Goethe cycle track and the Feininger cycle track. For inner city everyday traffic, some cycle lanes exist along several main streets. Bike rental is offered in the city centre.

==== Bus service ====
For a small city, Weimar is well served by city [[bus]] routes, which also serve all of the surrounding towns and villages. An hourly bus route serves the Buchenwald Memorial and [[Classic car|oldtimer]] buses operate in the city's historical centre. All bus routes are connected at Goethe Square in the city centre, and many also serve the main railway station. [[Tram]]s served the city from 1899 to 1937. [[Trolleybus]] service started in 1948 and was discontinued in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Alan|title=World Trolleybus Encyclopaedia|year=2000|page=69|publisher=Trolleybooks|location=Yateley, Hampshire, UK|isbn=0-904235-18-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
[[File:Bauhaus University Weimar 03.JPG|thumb|University's main building]]
After the reunification, the educational system was realigned. Some academies were combined into the new [[Bauhaus University, Weimar|Bauhaus University]], founded in 1996 with approximately 4,200 students and focus on architecture, design and media. The [[Hochschule für Musik &quot;Franz Liszt&quot;, Weimar|Liszt School of Music]] is a university focussed on music and music education founded in 1872 with 850 students today. Furthermore, there are three regular [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]], the ''Musikgymnasium Schloss Belvedere'', an elite boarding school with focus on music, and the Thuringia International School with an international (and foreign language) curriculum.

The most important archives in Weimar are the ''Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv'' (member of UNESCO [[Memory of the World Programme]]) with focus on German literary history and the Thuringia Main State Archive with governmental documents from last 500 years. The [[Duchess Anna Amalia Library]] hosts books and documents of German literary and cultural history.

'''Vesta''' ([[minor-planet designation]]: '''4 Vesta''') is one of the largest objects in the [[asteroid belt]], with a mean [[diameter]] of {{convert|525|km}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2012&quot;/&gt; It was discovered by the German astronomer [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers]] on 29 March 1807&lt;ref name=&quot;jpldata&quot;/&gt; and is named after [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], the virgin goddess of home and hearth from [[Roman mythology]].

Vesta is the second-largest asteroid, both by mass and by volume, after the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASADawnMission&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CambridgeSS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2011&quot;/&gt; It constitutes an estimated 9% of the mass of the [[asteroid belt]].&lt;!-- 1.344±0.001 ÷ 15±2 (E-10 solar masses) --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitjeva05&quot;/&gt; It is only slightly larger than [[2 Pallas]] (about 5% by volume), but is 25% to 30% more massive.

Vesta is the [[brightest asteroid]] visible from Earth. Its maximum distance from the [[Sun]] is slightly greater than the minimum distance of Ceres from the Sun,{{efn|1=On 10 February 2009, during Ceres [[Apsis|perihelion]], Ceres was closer to the Sun than Vesta, because Vesta has an [[Apsis|aphelion]] distance greater than Ceres's perihelion distance.

==History==
[[File:The Four Largest Asteroids.jpg|thumb|left|Relative sizes of the four largest asteroids. Vesta is second from left.]]

===Discovery===
[[File:Ceres and Vesta, Moon size comparison.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Vesta, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], and the [[Moon]] with sizes shown to scale]]
Heinrich Olbers discovered [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] in 1802, the year after the discovery of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]].  He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a [[Phaeton (hypothetical planet)|destroyed planet]].  He sent a letter with his proposal to the British astronomer [[William Herschel]], suggesting that a search near the locations where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected might reveal more fragments. These orbital intersections were located in the [[constellation]]s of [[Cetus]] and [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Littmann2004&quot;/&gt;  Olbers commenced his search in 1802, and on 29 March 1807 he discovered Vesta in the constellation Virgo—a coincidence, because Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are not fragments of a larger body.  Because the asteroid [[3 Juno|Juno]] had been discovered in 1804, this made Vesta the fourth object to be identified in the region that is now known as the [[asteroid belt]].  The discovery was announced in a letter addressed to German astronomer [[Johann Hieronymus Schröter|Johann H. Schröter]] dated 31 March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn1907&quot;/&gt;  Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet (Pallas; at the time, the asteroids were considered to be planets), he gave the honor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirm the existence of Ceres, the first asteroid, and who had computed the orbit of the new planet in the remarkably short time of 10 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunnington2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rao2003&quot;/&gt;  Gauss decided on the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] virgin goddess of home and hearth, [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MPDictionary&quot;/&gt;

===Name===
Vesta was the fourth asteroid to be discovered, hence the number 4 in its formal designation. The name ''Vesta'', or national variants thereof, is in international use with two exceptions: [[Greece]] and China. In [[Modern Greek|Greek]], the name adopted was the Hellenic equivalent of Vesta, [[Hestia]] ({{lang|el|4 Εστία}}); in English, that name is used for [[46 Hestia]] (Greeks use the name &quot;Hestia&quot; for both, with the minor-planet numbers used for disambiguation). In [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], Vesta is called the 'hearth-god(dess) star', {{lang|zh|灶神星}} ''{{transl|zh|zàoshénxīng}}'', naming the asteroid for Vesta's role rather than literally transliterating her name into Chinese, as is done with other bodies discovered in modern times, including [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and [[Pluto]].{{efn|1=維斯塔 ''wéisītǎ'', with an obscure ''ī'', is the closest Chinese approximation of the Latin pronunciation ''westa''.}}

Upon its discovery, Vesta was, like Ceres, Pallas, and Juno before it, classified as a planet and given a [[Astronomical symbols|planetary symbol]]. The symbol represented the altar of Vesta with its [[Sacred fire of Vesta|sacred fire]] and was designed by Gauss.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcbeh-v15&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;effemeridi-1809&quot;/&gt;  In Gauss's conception, this was drawn {{nowrap|[[File:Simbolo di Vesta.svg|x15px|Gauss's version of the astronomical symbol for Vesta]];}} in its modern form, it is {{nowrap|[[File:Vesta symbol.svg|x20px|modern version of the astronomical symbol for Vesta]].{{efn|1=Other sources contemporaneous to Gauss used a more elaborate form of the symbol, [[File:4 Vesta (2).svg|x20px|Elaborate form of the astronomical symbol for Vesta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;annuaire-1808&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canovai1810&quot;/&gt;}}}}

After the discovery of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets.&lt;ref name=&quot;18planets&quot;/&gt;  However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, each with its own symbol, in addition to the eight major planets ([[Neptune]] had been discovered in 1846).  It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly.  That year, the problem was addressed by [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould]], who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid.  Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the generic symbol ④.  This was soon coupled with the name into an official number–name designation, ''④ Vesta'', as the number of minor planets increased.  By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, ''(4) Vesta'', which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as ''4) Vesta'' and ''4, Vesta'', was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhenbecameMPs&quot;/&gt;  Today, either ''Vesta'', or, more commonly, ''4 Vesta'', is used.

===Early measurements===
[[File:New SPHERE view of Vesta.jpg|thumb|[[Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research|SPHERE]] image is shown on the left, with a synthetic view derived from ''Dawn'' images shown on the right for comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New SPHERE view of Vesta |url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1826a/ |website=www.eso.org |access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Photometric observations of Vesta were made at the [[Harvard College Observatory]] in 1880–1882 and at the [[Observatoire de Toulouse]] in 1909. These and other observations allowed the rotation rate of Vesta to be determined by the 1950s. However, the early estimates of the rotation rate came into question because the [[light curve]] included variations in both shape and [[albedo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McFadden2008&quot;/&gt;

Early estimates of the diameter of Vesta ranged from 383 (in 1825) to {{val|444|u=km}}. [[Edward Charles Pickering|E.C. Pickering]] produced an estimated diameter of {{val|513|17|u=km}} in 1879, which is close to the modern value for the mean diameter, but the subsequent estimates ranged from a low of {{val|390|u=km}} up to a high of {{val|602|u=km}} during the next century. The measured estimates were based on [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. In 1989, [[speckle interferometry]] was used to measure a dimension that varied between 498 and {{val|548|u=km}} during the rotational period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes1994&quot;/&gt; In 1991, an [[occultation]] of the star [[SAO 93228]] by Vesta was observed from multiple locations in the eastern United States and Canada. Based on observations from 14 different sites, the best fit to the data was an elliptical profile with dimensions of about {{val|550|u=km}} × {{val|462|u=km}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Povenmire2001&quot;/&gt; ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' confirmed this measurement.

Vesta became the first asteroid to have its mass determined. Every 18 years, the asteroid [[197 Arete]] approaches within {{val|0.04|ul=AU}} of Vesta. In 1966, based upon observations of Vesta's [[gravitational perturbation]]s of Arete, Hans G. Hertz estimated the mass of Vesta at {{val|1.20|0.08|e=-10}} [[solar mass]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;science160_3825&quot;/&gt; More refined estimates followed, and in 2001 the perturbations of [[17 Thetis]] were used to calculate the mass of Vesta to be {{val|1.31|0.02|e=-10}} solar masses.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa430&quot;/&gt; ''Dawn'' determined it to be {{val|1.3029|e=-10}} solar masses.

==Orbit==
Vesta orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, within the [[asteroid belt]], with a period of 3.6 Earth years,&lt;ref name=&quot;jpldata&quot;/&gt; specifically in the inner asteroid belt, interior to the [[Kirkwood gap]] at 2.50&amp;nbsp;AU. Its orbit is moderately inclined (''i'' = 7.1°, compared to 7° for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and 17° for [[Pluto]]) and moderately [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (''e'' = 0.09, about the same as for Mars).&lt;ref name=&quot;jpldata&quot;/&gt;

True [[orbital resonance]]s between asteroids are considered unlikely; due to their small masses relative to their large separations, such relationships should be very rare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christou&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, Vesta is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 1:1 resonant orbital relationships (for periods up to 2 million years or more); about forty such objects have been identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christou2012&quot;/&gt; Decameter-sized objects detected in the vicinity of Vesta by ''Dawn'' may be such [[quasi-satellite]]s rather than proper satellites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christou2012&quot;/&gt;

Vesta's rotation is relatively fast for an asteroid (5.342&amp;nbsp;h) and [[Retrograde motion|prograde]], with the north pole pointing in the direction of [[right ascension]] 20&amp;nbsp;h&amp;nbsp;32&amp;nbsp;min, [[declination]] +48° (in the constellation [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]]) with an uncertainty of about 10°. This gives an [[axial tilt]] of 29°.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas1997b&quot;/&gt;

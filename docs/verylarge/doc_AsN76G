The [[1997 rebellion in Albania]] was partially motivated by the collapse of [[Ponzi scheme]]s; however, they were widely referred to as pyramid schemes due to their prevalence in Albanian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2000/03/jarvis.htm |title=Finance and Development |website=Finance and Development {{!}} F&amp;D |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) disclosed what it called an Internet-based &quot;pyramid scam.&quot; Its complaint states that customers would pay a registration fee to join a program that called itself an &quot;internet mall&quot; and purchase a package of [[goods and services]] such as internet mail, and that the company offered &quot;significant commissions&quot; to consumers who purchased and resold the package. The FTC alleged that the company's program was instead and in reality a pyramid scheme that did not disclose that most consumers' money would be kept, and that it gave affiliates material that allowed them to scam others.&lt;ref name=&quot;ftc-internetmall&quot;&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2003/07/nexgen.htm FTC Charges Internet Mall Is a Pyramid Scam] ''Federal Trade Commission''&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants were asked to contribute €20,000 each to a &quot;Liberty&quot; scheme which followed the classic eight-ball model. Payments were made in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] to skirt Irish tax laws concerning gifts. Spin-off schemes called &quot;Speedball&quot; and &quot;People in Profit&quot; prompted a number of violent incidents and calls were made by politicians to tighten existing legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2006/03/23/story514972170.asp Gardaí hold firearm after pyramid scheme incident] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323234753/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2006/03/23/story514972170.asp |date=2008-03-23 }} ''Irish Examiner''&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland has launched a website to better educate consumers to pyramid schemes and other scams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerconnect.ie/eng/ |title=National Consumer Agency Ireland |publisher=Consumerconnect.ie |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 2008, riots broke out in the municipalities of [[Pasto (Colombia)|Pasto]], [[Tumaco]], [[Popayán|Popayan]] and [[Santander de Quilichao]], [[Colombia]] after the collapse of several pyramid schemes. Thousands of victims had invested their money in pyramids that promised them extraordinary interest rates. The lack of regulation laws allowed those pyramids to grow excessively during several years. Finally, after the riots, the Colombian government was forced to declare the country in a state of economic emergency to seize and stop those schemes. Several of the pyramid's managers were arrested, and are being prosecuted for the crime of &quot;illegal massive money reception.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

In the United Kingdom in 2008 and 2009, a £21 million pyramid scheme named 'Give and Take' involved at least 10,000 victims in the south-west of England and South Wales.

[[BurnLounge]], Inc. was a multi-level marketing [[online music store]] founded in 2004 and based in New York City. By 2006 the company reported 30,000 members using the site to sell music through its network. In 2007 the company was sued by the Federal Trade Commission for being an illegal pyramid scheme. The company lost the suit in 2012, and lost appeal in June 2014. In June 2015, the FTC began returning $1.9 million to people who had lost money in the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hull|first1=Tim|title=9th Circuit Affirms BurnLounge Judgment|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/06/02/68376.htm|accessdate=19 June 2014|work=Courthouse News|date=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Airplane Game scheme resurfaced in 2020 as a savings club by the name of the Blessing Loom, Blessing Circle, Sending Flower, Gifting Flower, and so on. It is also misrepresented as a [[Susu (informal loan club)|Sou-Sou]], a legitimate savings club model where the number of people paying into the pot is fixed and each person gets a payout on regular basis.

== Accounts ==
=== The Icelandic Sagas ===
According to the ''[[Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok]]'', ''[[Tale of Ragnar's sons]]'', ''[[Heimskringla]]'', ''[[Hervarar Saga]]'', ''[[Sögubrot]]'', and many other Icelandic sources, Ragnar was the son of the Swedish king [[Sigurd Ring]]. Nearly all of the sagas agree that the Danish king [[Randver]] was Sigurd's father, with the ''Hervarar saga'' citing his wife as Åsa, the daughter of King [[Harald Granraude|Harald of the Red Moustache]] from Norway. The accounts further tell that Randver was a grandson of the legendary Scandinavian king [[Ivar Vidfamne]] by his daughter Aud (whom the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' calls Alfhild).&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, Christopher, &amp; Turville-Petre, G. (eds) (1956) ''Hervarar Saga ok Heidreks''. London: Viking Society for Northern Research, p. 68-9. [http://www.vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Text%20Series/Hervarar%20saga%20ok%20heidreks.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of king [[Ivar Vidfamne]], Aud's eldest son by the Danish king [[Hrœrekr Ringslinger]], Harald, conquered all of his grandfather's territory and became known as [[Harald Wartooth]]. Harald's nephew Sigurd Ring became the chief king of Sweden after Randver's death (Denmark according to ''Hervarar saga''), presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd and Harald fought the Battle of the Brávellir ([[Bråvalla]]) on the plains of [[Östergötland]], where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd then ruled Sweden and Denmark (being sometimes identified with a Danish king [[Sigfred]] who ruled from about 770 until his death prior to 804). He sired a son with the Norwegian princess Alfhild of the semi-mythical Álfar people, Ragnar Lodbrok, who succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm ''Sögubrot'', Chapter 10]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eysteinn Beli]], who according to the ''Hervarar Saga'' was Harald Wartooth's son, ruled Sweden sometime after Sigurd until he was slain by the sons of Ragnar and [[Aslaug]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/ThattrRagnarsSonar.html ''The Tale of Ragnar's Sons'', Chapter 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In their accounts of his reign, the Sagas of Icelandic Prehistory, known as [[fornaldarsaga]]&lt;ref&gt;http://fasnl.ku.dk/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312033326_Sagas_of_Icelandic_Prehistory_fornaldarsogur ''fornaldarsögur'', chapter 25]&lt;/ref&gt; tell more about Ragnar's marriages than about feats of warfare. According to the ''Sögubrot'', &quot;he was the biggest and fairest of men that human eyes have seen, and he was like his mother in appearance and took after her kin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm '' Sögubrot'', Chapter 10]&lt;/ref&gt; He first killed a giant snake that guarded the abode of the [[Östergötland|East Geatic]] jarl's daughter [[Thora Borgarhjort]], thereby winning her as his wife. The unusual protective clothes that Ragnar wore, when attacking the serpent, earned him the nickname Lodbrok (&quot;shaggy breeches&quot;). His sons with Thora were [[Erik Weatherhat|Erik]] and Agnar. After Thora died, he discovered [[Aslaug|Kráka]], a woman of outstanding beauty and wisdom living with a poor peasant couple in Norway, and married her. This marriage resulted in the sons [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Björn Ironside]], [[Hvitserk]], Ragnvald and [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/ragnar.htm ''Ragnars Saga Lodbrokar'', Chapters 4 and 7]&lt;/ref&gt; Kráka was later revealed to actually be Aslaug, a secret daughter of the renowned hero [[Sigurd|Sigurd Fafnesbane]]. As the sons grew up to become renowned warriors, Ragnar, not wishing to be outdone, resolved to conquer England with merely two ships. He was however defeated by superior English forces and was thrown into a snake pit to die in agony.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/ragnar.htm ''Ragnars Saga Lodbrokar'', Chapter 15]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok'', ''Tale of Ragnar's Sons'', and ''Heimskringla'' all tell of the [[Great Heathen Army]] that invaded England at around 866, led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok to wreak revenge against King [[Ælla of Northumbria]] who is told to have captured and executed Ragnar.

=== Danish sources ===
The ''[[Chronicon Roskildense]]'' (c. 1138) mentions Lodbrok (Lothpardus) as father to the utterly cruel Norse King Ywar (rex crudelissimus Normannorum Ywar) and his brothers, Inguar (a double of Ywar), Ubbi, Byorn and Ulf, who rule the northern peoples. They call on the various Danish petty kings to help them ruin the realm of the [[Franks]]. Ywar successfully attacks the kingdoms of Britain, though not as an act of revenge as in the Icelandic sagas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/scriptoresminore112gert#page/16/mode/2up ''Chronicon Roskildense'', p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle of [[Sven Aggesen]] (c. 1190) is the first Danish text that mentions the full name, Regnerus Lothbrogh. His son Sigurd invades Denmark and kills its king, whose daughter he marries as he takes over the throne. Their son in turn is [[Hardeknud I|Knut]], ancestor of the later Danish kings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/scriptoresminore112gert#page/106/mode/2up Sven Aggeson, p. 106]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither of these sources mentions Ragnar Lodbrok as a Danish ruler. The first to do so is [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (c. 1200). This work mixes Norse legend with data about Danish history derived from the chronicle of [[Adam of Bremen]] (c. 1075).&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=399 Storm (1877), p. 387-9]&lt;/ref&gt; Here Ragnar's father Sigurd Ring is a Norwegian prince married to a Danish princess, and different from the victor of Brávellir (who had flourished about thirteen generations earlier). Sigurd Ring and his cousin and rival Ring (that is, Sigfred and [[Anulo]] of recorded history, d. 812) are both killed in battle, whereupon Ragnar is elevated to the Danish kingship (identified by Saxo with [[Reginfrid|Ragnfred]], d. 814&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=411 Storm (1877), p. 399]&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/541 Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 539-41]&lt;/ref&gt;  His first deed is the defeat of the Swedish king Frö, who has killed Ragnar's grandfather. Ragnar is assisted in this by the ferocious shield-maiden [[Ladgerda]], whom he forces to marry him. In this marriage he sires the son Fridleif and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/543 Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 542-3]&lt;/ref&gt;  He later repudiates the unreliable Ladgerda and instead wins the daughter of the Swedish king [[Herrauðr]], [[Thora Borgarhjort|Thora]], after killing two venomous giant snakes that guard her residence. His sons with Thora are Radbard, Dunvat, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, Björn Ironside, Agnar and Ivar the Boneless. From a non-marital affair with the daughter of one Esbjørn, Ragnar begets [[Ubba|Ubbe]], while his last marriage with Svanlaug produces another three sons, Ragnvald, [[Eric Weatherhat]] and [[Hvitserk]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/550 Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 545, 550]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sons were installed as sub-kings in various conquered territories. Ragnar led a Viking expedition to England and slew its king Hama, proceeding to kill the earls of Scotland and install Sigurd Snake-in-the Eye and Radbard as governors. Norway was also subjugated, and Fridleif was made ruler there and in [[Orkney]]. Later on, Ragnar with three sons invaded Sweden where a new king called Sörle had appeared and withheld the heritage of Thora's sons. Sörle and his army were massacred and Björn Ironside was installed on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/551 Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 551]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some time later Björn was put in charge of Norway, while Ragnar appointed another son, Eric Weatherhat, as ruler in Sweden; he was subsequently killed by a certain [[Eysteinn Beli|Eysteinn]]. One of the sons, Ubbe, revolted against his father at the instigation of his maternal grandfather Esbjørn, and could only be defeated and captured with utmost effort.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/557 Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 557]&lt;/ref&gt; Saxo moreover tells of repeated expeditions to the [[British Isles]], one of which cost the lives of Dunvat and Radbard. Ælla, son of Hama, expelled Ragnar's sub-ruler Ivar the Boneless from England with the help of the Galli (Gaill, Hiberno-Norse?&lt;ref&gt;Smyth (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;) and remained a persistent enemy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/560 Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 560-1]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the [[Scythians]] were forced to accept Hvitserk as their ruler. In the end Hvitserk was treacherously captured by the [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontian]] prince Daxon and burnt alive with his own admission. Hearing this, Ragnar led an expedition to [[Kievan Rus']] and captured Daxon who was curiously spared and exiled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/558 Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 558-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Icelandic sources, Saxo's account of Ragnar Lodbrok's reign is largely a catalog of successful Viking invasions over an enormous geographical area. Among the seaborne expeditions was one against the [[Bjarmians]] and [[Finns]] ([[Sami people|Saami]]) in the Arctic north. The Bjarmian use of magic spells caused foul weather and the sudden death of many Danish invaders, and the Finnish archers on skis turned out to be a formidable foe. Eventually these two tribes were put to flight and the Bjarmian king was slain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/554 Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 558-9]&lt;/ref&gt; The historical king [[Harald Klak]] is by Saxo (based on a passage in Adam's chronicle) made into another persistent enemy of Ragnar, who several times incited the [[Jutes]] and [[Skåne|Scanians]] to rebel, but was regularly defeated. After the last victory over Harald, Ragnar learned that King Ælla had massacred Ragnar's men on [[Ireland]]. Incensed, he attacked the English king with his fleet but was captured and thrown into the snake pit, similar to the Icelandic sagas. In spite of all his praise for Ragnar Lodbrok, Saxo also considers his fate as God's rightful vengeance for the contempt he had shown the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/563 Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 562-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poetic and epigraphic sources ===
While the narrative Norse sources date from the 12th and 13th centuries, there are also many older poems that mention him and his kin. The ''[[Ragnarsdrápa]]'', ostensibly composed by [[Bragi Boddason]] in the 9th century, praises a Ragnar, son of Sigurd, for a richly decorated shield that the poet has received. The shield depicts the assault on [[Ermanaric|Jörmunrek]], the [[Hjaðningavíg]] tale, the ploughing of [[Gefjon]], and [[Thor]]'s struggle with the [[Midgard Serpent]]. Recent scholarship has suggested that the poem is in fact from c. 1000 and celebrates the Norse reconquest of England. The four tales depicted on the shield would then symbolize four aspects of the Lodbrok saga (the initial defeat of the sons of Lodbrok in England due to recklessness, Ivar the Boneless's deceitful approach to King Ælla, Ivar's cunning snatching of land from Ælla, Ragnar's struggle against the giant serpent in order to win Thora).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot;, ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 24, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Knutsdrapa'' of [[Sigvat Thordarson]] (c. 1038) mentions the death of Ælla at the hands of Ivar in [[York]], who &quot;carved the eagle on Ælla's back&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth (1977), p. 193-4.&lt;/ref&gt; From this the story of the atrocious revenge of Lodbrok's sons already seems to be present. The reference to a &quot;[[blood eagle]]&quot; punishment has however been much debated by modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rory McTurk]], &quot;Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria&quot;, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171200/http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Another lay, ''[[Krakumal]]'', put in the mouth of the dying Ragnar in the snake pit, recounts the exploits of Ragnar and mentions battles over a wide geographical area, several relating to the British isles. The poem's name, &quot;Kráka's lay&quot;, alludes to Ragnar's wife's [[Aslaug|Kráka]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Krákumál&quot;, ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 17 (2001), p. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; though modern philologists commonly date it to the 12th century in its present form.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth (1977), p. 73-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one runic inscription mentioning Lodbrok, carved on the prehistorical tumulus of [[Maeshowe]] on Orkney in the early 12th century. It reads: &quot;This howe was built a long time before Lodbrok's. Her sons, they were bold; scarcely ever were there such tall men of their hands&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth (1977), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The expression &quot;her sons&quot; has given rise to the theory that Lodbrok was originally thought of as a woman,&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Storm (1877), &quot;Ragnar Lodbrok og Lodbrokssønnerne; studie i dansk oldhistorie og nordisk sagnhistorie&quot;, ''Historisk Tidskrift'' II:1 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639;view=1up;seq=419]&lt;/ref&gt; mother of the historically known sons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rory McTurk]], &quot;Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria&quot;, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171200/http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm];&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frankish accounts of a 9th-century Viking leader named Ragnar ===
The [[Siege of Paris (845)|Siege of Paris]] and the Sack of Paris of 845 was the culmination of a Viking invasion of the kingdom of the West Franks. The Viking forces were led by a Norse chieftain named &quot;Reginherus&quot;, or Ragnar.{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}}  This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok,&lt;ref&gt;''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 24, p. 111, 113, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; but the accuracy of this is disputed by historians.{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}}{{Sfn | Sprague | 2007 | p = 225}} Ragnar Lodbrok is also sometimes identified with a Ragnar who was awarded land in [[Torhout]], [[Flanders]], by [[Charles the Bald]] in about 841 but eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the King.{{Sfn | Sawyer | 2001 | p = 40}}  Ragnar's Vikings raided [[Rouen]] on their way up the Seine in 845 and in response to the invasion, determined not to let the royal [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]] (near Paris) be destroyed, Charles assembled an army which he divided into two parts, one for each side of the river.{{Sfn | Duckett | 1988 | p = 181}}{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 |  p = 212}} Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army, took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine to honour the [[Norse religion|Norse god]] [[Odin]], as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces.{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}}{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}} Ragnar's fleet made it back to his overlord, the Danish King [[Horik I]], but Ragnar soon died from a violent illness that also spread in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=450 Storm (1877), p. 438]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later continental accounts ===
Among the oldest texts to mention the name Lodbrok is the Norman history of [[William of Jumièges]] from c. 1070. According to William, the Danish kings of old had the custom to expel the younger sons from the kingdom to have them out of the way. At a time it happened that King Lodbrok succeeded his unnamed father on the Danish throne. After gaining power he honoured the said custom and ordered his junior son Björn Ironside to leave his realm. Björn thus left Denmark with a considerable fleet and started to ravage in West Francia and later the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013753564;view=1up;seq=23 Guillaume de Jumièges, ''Histoire des ducs de Normandie'', p. 11-3]&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly contemporary with William is [[Adam of Bremen]] whose history of the [[Archbishopric of Hamburg|Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]] contains many traditions about Viking Age Scandinavia. In a passage referring to the Viking raids of the late 9th century, he mentions the Danish or Norse pirates Horich, Orwig, Gotafrid, Rudolf and Inguar (Ivar). This Ivar is in particular seen as a cruel persecutor of Christians, and a son of Lodbrok (Inguar, filius Lodparchi).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/adamvonbremenham00adam#page/40/mode/2up Adam von Bremen, ''Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte'', p. 39-40]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anglo-Saxon and Irish accounts of the father of Ivar and Halfdan ===
According to the contemporary ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and [[Asser]]'s ''Life of Alfred'', in 878 the &quot;brother of Hingwar and Healfden&quot;, with a naval fleet, a contingent of the Great Heathen Army invaded [[Devon]] in England and fought the [[Battle of Cynwit]]. There the Vikings lost, their king slain and many dead, with few escaping to their ships. After the battle the [[Saxons]] took great plunder, and among other things the banner called &quot;Raven&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Garmonsway, G.N. (1972), ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. London: Dent, p. 75-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The early 12th century ''[[Annals of St Neots]]'' further state that ''&quot;they say that the three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, daughters of Lodebroch (Lodbrok), wove that flag and got it ready in one day. They say, moreover, that in every battle, wherever the flag went before them, if they were to gain the victory a live crow would appear flying on the middle of the flag; but if they were doomed to be defeated it would hang down motionless, and this was often proved to be so.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Garmonsway, G.N. (1972), ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. London: Dent, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; This is among the earlier references to the legendary hero Ragnar Lodbrok.

The Irish ''[[Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib]]'' from the 12th century, with information deriving from earlier annals, mentions king Halfdan (d. 877) under the name &quot;mac Ragnaill&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James Todd (1867), ''Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh'', London: Longman, p. 27 [https://archive.org/details/cogadhgaedhelreg00todd/page/26/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt; The form Ragnall may refer to either Ragnvald or Ragnar, and the entry is a strong indication that the name of Ivar's and Halfdan's father was really Ragnar or a similar name.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Alfred P. (1977) ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 263, 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The early 11th century ''[[Three Fragments]]'' contains a passage that gives a semi-legendary background to the capture of York by the Vikings in 866. The two younger sons of Halfdan, King of [[Lochlann]], expelled the eldest son Ragnall who sailed to the [[Orkney islands]] with his three sons and settled there. Two of the sons later raided the English and [[Franks]], proceeding to plunder in the Mediterranean. One of them learnt from a vision that Ragnall had fought a battle where the third son had been slain and in which he himself had most likely perished. The two Viking sons then returned home with a lot of dark-skinned captives.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Alfred P. (1977) ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized that this is an Irish version of ''Ragnar Lodbrok's saga'', the Mediterranean expedition being a historical event taking place in 859-61.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Alfred P. (1977) ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 64-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Ragnar's sons Ivar the Boneless, Halfdan Ragnarsson, Björn Ironside, Ubbe and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye are historical figures, opinion regarding their father is divided. Contemporary academia regards most of the stories about him to be fiction. According to [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]], writing in 1979,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain scholars in recent years have come to accept at least part of Ragnar's story as based on historical fact.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; A generation later, however, Katherine Holman wrote in 2003: &lt;blockquote&gt;Although his sons are historical figures, there is no evidence that Ragnar himself ever lived and he seems to be an amalgam of historical figures and literary invention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z&quot;&gt;Holman 2003 p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most significant medieval sources that mention Ragnar include:
* Book IX of the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', a 12th-century work by the Christian Danish chronicler [[Saxo Grammaticus]]
* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|Tale of Ragnar's sons]]'' (''Ragnarssona þáttr''), a [[legendary saga]]
* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar Lothbrok]] '', another saga, a sequel to the ''[[Völsunga saga]]''
* the ''[[Ragnarsdrápa]]'', a [[skaldic poem]] of which only fragments remain, attributed to the 9th-century poet [[Bragi Boddason]]
* the ''[[Krákumál]]'', Ragnar's death-song, an old and mysterious skaldic poem

In her commentary on Saxo's ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', Davidson notes that Saxo's coverage of Ragnar's legend in book IX of the ''Gesta'' appears to be an attempt to consolidate many of the confusing and contradictory events and stories known to the chronicler into the reign of one king, Ragnar. That is why many acts ascribed to Ragnar in the ''Gesta'' can be associated, through other sources, with various figures, some of whom are more historically tenable.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

The candidates scholars like to associate with the &quot;historical Ragnar&quot; include:
* the ''Reginherus'' or ''Ragnar'' who [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieged Paris]] in 845
* the Danish King [[Horik I]] (d. 854)
* King [[Reginfrid]] (d. 814), a king who ruled part of Denmark in tandem with his brother [[Harald Klak]], but was expelled by Horik I and his brothers and later fell in a battle against them
* possibly the [[Rognvald Eysteinsson|Ragnall]] (Ragnvald or Ragnar) of the [[Irish Annals]]{{sfn|Davidson|1980|p=277}}

Attempts to reliably associate the legendary Ragnar with one or several of those men have failed because of the difficulty in reconciling the various accounts and their chronology. But the tradition of a Viking hero named Ragnar (or similar) who wreaked havoc in mid-9th-century Europe and who fathered many famous sons is remarkably persistent, and some aspects of it are strengthened by relatively reliable sources, such as Irish historical tradition and, indirectly, the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature and media ==
Ragnar Lodbrok features prominently in the following works:
* [[Edwin Atherstone]]'s 1830 novel ''Sea-Kings in England''.
* [[Edison Marshall]]'s 1951 novel ''The Viking''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalnovels.info/Viking.html Historical Novels.info]&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;[[:fr:Ragnar le Viking|Ragnar le Viking]]&quot;, a 1955 comic book feature written by Jean Ollivier with art by Eduardo Teixeira Coelho, that ran in the French ''[[Pif Gadget|Vaillant]]'' magazine up to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bdoubliees.com/vaillantpif/series5/ragnar.htm BD oubliées]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Richard Parker's 1957 historical novel ''The Sword of [[Ganelon]]'' explores the character of Ragnar, his sons, and Viking raiding culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/richard-parker-4/the-sword-of-ganelon/ Kirkus Review]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1958 film ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'' based on Marshall's novel, in which Ragnar, played by [[Ernest Borgnine]], is captured by King Ælla and cast into a pit of wolves; a son named Einar {{sic}}, played by [[Kirk Douglas]], vows revenge and conquers [[Northumbria]] with help from half-brother (and sworn enemy) Eric (played by [[Tony Curtis]]), who also had much to avenge upon King Aella.
* [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s 1993 alternative history novel ''[[The Hammer and the Cross]]'' depicts Ragnar being shipwrecked, captured and executed, as well as his sons' revenge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-85439-3 Publisher's Weekly, review]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[History (Canadian TV network)|History]]'s popular 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' features Australian actor [[Travis Fimmel]] playing the lead character of Ragnar for the first four seasons.

The '''Russian Revolution of 1905''',{{Efn|{{lang-ru|Революция 1905 года}}.}} also known as the '''First Russian Revolution''',{{Efn|{{lang-ru|Первая Русская Революция}}.}} was a wave of mass political and social unrest that spread through vast areas of the [[Russian Empire]], some of which was directed at the government. It included worker [[strike action|strikes]], peasant unrest, and military [[mutiny|mutinies]]. It led to constitutional reform (namely the &quot;[[October Manifesto]]&quot;), including the establishment of the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]], the [[multi-party system]], and the [[Russian Constitution of 1906]].

The 1905 revolution was spurred by the Russian defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], which ended in the same year, but also by the growing realization by a variety of sectors of society of the need for reform. Politicians such as [[Sergei Witte]] had failed to accomplish this. While the [[Nicholas II|Tsar]] managed to keep his rule, the events foreshadowed those of the [[Russian revolution]]s in 1917, which resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy, execution of the imperial family, and creation of the [[Soviet Union]] by the [[Bolsheviks]].

Some historians contend that the 1905 revolution set the stage for the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]]s, and enabled  [[Bolshevism]] to emerge as a distinct political movement in Russia, although it was still a minority. [[Lenin]], as later [[Premier of the Soviet Union|head of the USSR]], called it &quot;The Great Dress Rehearsal&quot;, without which the &quot;victory of the [[October Revolution]] in 1917 would have been impossible&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ascher1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Abraham|last=Ascher|title=The Revolution of 1905: Russia in Disarray|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9J9Dt6EQHs8C&amp;pg=PA1|year=1994|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2327-5|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

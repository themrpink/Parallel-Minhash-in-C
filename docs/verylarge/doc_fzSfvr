[[File:Thor pipeline.jpg|thumb|alt=Thor Pipeline in Randers, Denmark|Thor Pipeline in [[Randers]], Denmark]]
Bars in the [[Veltins-Arena]], a major [[football (soccer)|football]] ground in [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany, are interconnected by a {{convert|5|km|adj=on}} long beer pipeline. In [[Randers]] city in Denmark, the so-called Thor Beer pipeline was operated. Originally, copper pipes ran directly from the brewery, but when the brewery moved out of the city in the 1990s, Thor Beer replaced it with a giant tank.

A three-kilometer beer pipeline was completed in [[Bruges]], Belgium in September 2016 to reduce truck traffic on the city streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2016/09/15/bruges-beer-pipeline-becomes-reality|title=Bruges' Beer Pipeline Becomes Reality|date=September 15, 2016|language=en|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brine===
The village of [[Hallstatt]] in Austria, which is known for its long history of [[salt mine|salt mining]], claims to contain &quot;the oldest industrial pipeline in the world&quot;, dating back to 1595.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/billie/hallstatt/hallstatt.html |title=Hallstatt's White Gold – Salt |access-date=2007-05-15 |author=Billie Ann Lopez |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210142713/http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/billie/hallstatt/hallstatt.html |archive-date = 2007-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed from 13,000 hollowed-out tree [[trunk (botany)|trunks]] to transport [[brine]] {{convert|40|km}} from Hallstatt to [[Ebensee]].&lt;ref&gt;See the article [[Hallstatt]] for details and references.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milk===
Between 1978 and 1994, a 15&amp;nbsp;km milk pipeline ran between the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] island of [[Ameland]] and [[Holwerd]] on the mainland, of which 8&amp;nbsp;km beneath the [[Wadden Sea]]. Every day, 30,000 litres of milk produced on the island were transported to be processed on the mainland. In 1994, the milk transport was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digibron.nl/search/detail/012df08e8a4ffc97d1a4d1a1/amelandse-melk-niet-meer-door-wkddenzeepijp Amelandse melk niet meer door Waddenzeepijp], Reformatorisch Dagblad 20 January 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine pipelines==
{{Main|Submarine pipeline}}
In places, a pipeline may have to cross water expanses, such as small seas, straits and rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palmer&amp;KingP.2&quot;&gt;Palmer &amp; King, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, they lie entirely on the seabed. These pipelines are referred to as &quot;marine&quot; pipelines (also, &quot;submarine&quot; or &quot;offshore&quot; pipelines). They are used primarily to carry oil or gas, but transportation of water is also important.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palmer&amp;KingP.2&quot;/&gt; In offshore projects, a distinction is made between a &quot;flowline&quot; and a pipeline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palmer&amp;KingP.2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DeanP.338&quot;&gt;Dean, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bai&amp;BaiP.24&quot;&gt;Bai &amp; Bai, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The former is an ''intrafield'' pipeline, in the sense that it is used to connect subsea [[wellhead]]s, manifolds and the [[oil platform|platform]] ''within'' a particular development field. The latter, sometimes referred to as an &quot;export pipeline&quot;, is used to bring the resource to shore.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeanP.338&quot;/&gt; The construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland, mainly because of wave and current dynamics, along with other [[geohazard]]s.

==Functions==
In general, pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose:

;Gathering pipelines: Group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility. In this group, pipelines are usually short- a couple hundred metres- and with small diameters. Sub-sea pipelines for collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems.
;Transportation pipelines: Mainly long pipes with large diameters, moving products (oil, gas, refined products) between cities, countries and even continents. These transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas lines or pump stations for crude and multi-products pipelines.
;Distribution pipelines: Composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters, used to take the products to the final consumer. Feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream. Pipelines at terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups.

==Development and planning==
When a pipeline is built, the construction project not only covers the [[civil engineering]] work to lay the pipeline and build the pump/compressor stations, it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation.

The pipeline is routed along what is known as a &quot;right of way&quot;. Pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages:

# Open season to determine market interest: Potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipeline's capacity rights.
# Route (right of way) selection
# Pipeline design: The pipeline project may take a number of forms, including the construction of a new pipeline, conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another, or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route.
# Obtaining approval: Once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity, the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies.
# Surveying the route
# Clearing the route
# Trenching – Main Route and Crossings (roads, rail, other pipes, etc.)
# Installing the pipe
# Installing valves, intersections, etc.
# Covering the pipe and trench
# Testing: Once construction is completed, the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity. These may include hydrostatic testing and line packing.&lt;ref name=&quot;eia.gov&quot;&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/develop.html &quot;Natural Gas Pipeline Development and Expansion],&quot; U.S. Energy Information Administration, Retrieved December 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia has &quot;Pipeline Troops&quot; as part of the [[Rear Services]], who are trained to build and repair pipelines. Russia is the only country to have Pipeline Troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://de.rian.ru/politics/20120116/262467833.html |title=Russlands Militär übt für möglichen US-Angriff auf Iran |publisher=Ria Novosti |language=de |access-date=17 January 2012 |date=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Field devices are instrumentation, data gathering units and communication systems. The field [[instrumentation]] includes flow, pressure, and temperature gauges/transmitters, and other devices to measure the relevant data required. These instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations, such as injection or delivery stations, pump stations (liquid pipelines) or compressor stations (gas pipelines), and block valve stations.

The information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local [[remote terminal unit]]s (RTU) that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems, such as satellite channels, microwave links, or cellular phone connections.

Pipelines are controlled and operated remotely, from what is usually known as the &quot;Main Control Room&quot;. In this center, all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database. The data is received from multiple RTUs along the pipeline. It is common to find RTUs installed at every station along the pipeline.
[[File:Pipeline-Scada.jpg|thumb|500px|The SCADA System for pipelines.]]

The [[SCADA]] system at the Main Control Room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or [[SCADA#Human Machine Interface|Human Machine Interface]], showing the operational conditions of the pipeline. The operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line, as well as send operational commands (open/close valves, turn on/off compressors or pumps, change setpoints, etc.) through the SCADA system to the field.

To optimize and secure the operation of these assets, some pipeline companies are using what is called &quot;Advanced Pipeline Applications&quot;, which are software tools installed on top of the SCADA system, that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection, leak location, batch tracking (liquid lines), pig tracking, composition tracking, predictive modeling, look ahead modeling, and operator training.

==Technology==

===Components===
[[File:Trans-Alaska Pipeline crossing a ridge by Tanana River.jpg|thumb|right|The Trans Alaska Pipeline crossing under the [[Delta River]] and over ridge of the [[Alaska Range]]]]
Pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location. The main elements of a pipeline system are:

;Initial injection station: Known also as &quot;supply&quot; or &quot;inlet&quot; station, is the beginning of the system, where the product is injected into the line. Storage facilities, pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations.

;Compressor/pump stations: [[Pump]]s for liquid pipelines and [[compressors]] for gas pipelines, are located along the line to move the product through the pipeline. The location of these stations is defined by the topography of the terrain, the type of product being transported, or operational conditions of the network.

;Partial delivery station: Known also as &quot;intermediate stations&quot;, these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of the product being transported.

;Block valve station: These are the first line of protection for pipelines. With these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak. Block valve stations are usually located every 20 to {{convert|30|mi|km}}, depending on the type of pipeline. Even though it is not a design rule, it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines. The location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported, the trajectory of the pipeline and/or the operational conditions of the line.

;Regulator station: This is a special type of valve station, where the operator can release some of the pressure from the line. Regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak.

;Final delivery station: Known also as &quot;outlet&quot; stations or terminals, this is where the product will be distributed to the consumer. It could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for gas pipelines.

===Leak detection systems===
Since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country, it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets, and the population and environment where these pipelines run.

Pipeline companies face government regulation, environmental constraints and social situations. Government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation, operator training requirements, pipeline facilities, technology and applications required to ensure operational safety. For example, in the State of Washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of 8 percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less. Social factors also affect the operation of pipelines. Product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies. In this case, the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow, with a high expectation for location accuracy.

Various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines, from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance. The most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is Computational Pipeline Monitoring or CPM. CPM takes information from the field related to pressures, flows, and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported. Once the estimation is completed, the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation, which may be related to a leak.

The [[American Petroleum Institute]] has published several articles related to the performance of CPM in liquids pipelines. The API Publications are:
*RAM 1130 – Computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines
*API 1149 – Pipeline variable uncertainties &amp; their effects on leak detectability

Where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway, it is usually enclosed in a protective casing. This casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the build-up of flammable gases or corrosive substances, and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks. The ''casing vent'', a pipe protruding from the ground, often doubles as a warning marker called a ''casing vent marker''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.consolenergy.com/natural-gas-amp-coal/natural-gas/pipeline-safety.aspx Pipeline Safety] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101537/http://www.consolenergy.com/natural-gas-amp-coal/natural-gas/pipeline-safety.aspx |date=2015-05-18 }}'', CONSOL Energy, accessed 2015-05-13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Pipelines are generally laid underground because temperature is less variable. Because pipelines are usually metal, this helps to reduce the expansion and shrinkage that can occur with weather changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oil and Gas Pipelines|last=Saxon|first=Carina|publisher=Gale|year=2016|isbn=9781410317513|pages=636–639}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a [[pipeline bridge]]. Pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead. Pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as Trans-Alaska-Pipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground.

==Maintenance==
Maintenance of pipelines includes checking [[cathodic protection]] levels for the proper range, surveillance for construction, erosion, or leaks by foot, land vehicle, boat, or air, and running cleaning pigs, when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive.

US pipeline maintenance rules are covered in [[Code of Federal Regulations]](CFR) sections, 49 CFR 192 for natural gas pipelines, and 49 CFR 195 for petroleum liquid pipelines.

==Regulation==
[[File:BlendonWoodsPipeline.JPG|thumb|right|An underground petroleum pipeline running through a park]]
In the US, onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the [[Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration]] (PHMSA). Certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the [[Minerals Management Service]] (MMS). In Canada, pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or, if they cross provincial boundaries or the Canada–US border, by the [[National Energy Board]] (NEB). Government regulations in Canada and the United States require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from [[corrosion]]. Often, the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline [[Industrial coating|coating]] in conjunction with [[cathodic protection]] and technology to monitor the pipeline. Above ground, cathodic protection is not an option. The coating is the only external protection.

==Pipelines and geopolitics==
Pipelines for major energy resources (petroleum and natural gas) are not merely an element of trade. They connect to issues of [[geopolitics]] and [[international security]] as well, and the construction, placement, and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in [[Sovereign state|state]] interests and actions. A notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year 2009, wherein [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|a dispute]] between Russia and [[Ukraine]] ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis. Russian state-owned gas company [[Gazprom]] cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine after talks between it and the Ukrainian government fell through. In addition to cutting off supplies to Ukraine, Russian gas flowing through Ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to [[Southeastern Europe]] and some supplies to [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]]—was cut off, creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on Russian gas as fuel. Russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers, and particularly the [[European Union]], from interfering in its &quot;[[near abroad]]&quot;.

Oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]].

==Hazard identification==
&lt;!-- Hazard identification is the proper wording in risk assessment --&gt;
Because the [[solvent]] fraction of [[dilbit]] typically comprises [[volatile organic compound|volatile]] [[aromatics]] like [[naptha]] and [[benzene]], reasonably rapid carrier [[vaporization]] can be expected to follow an above-ground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a [[viscous]] residue that is slow to migrate. Effective protocols to minimize exposure to [[petrochemical]] vapours are well-established, and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the [[aquifer]] unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier (e.g. a series of torrential downpours).

The introduction of [[benzene]] and other volatile organic compounds (collectively [[BTEX]]) to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak. Particularly if followed by rain, a pipeline breach would result in BTEX [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] and [[chemical equilibrium|equilibration]] of benzene in water, followed by [[percolation]] of the admixture into the aquifer. Benzene can cause many [[benzene#Health effects|health problems]] and is [[carcinogenic]] with EPA [[Maximum Contaminant Level]] (MCL) set at 5 μg/L for [[potable water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Basic Information about Benzene in Drinking Water|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/benzene.cfm|access-date=2013-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220141636/http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/benzene.cfm|archive-date=2013-02-20|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not well studied, single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calabrese|first=EJ|author2=Blain, RB |title=The single exposure carcinogen database: assessing the circumstances under which a single exposure to a carcinogen can cause cancer|journal=Toxicological Sciences|year=1999|volume=50|issue=2|pages=169–85|doi=10.1093/toxsci/50.2.169|pmid=10478853|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the exposure of livestock, mainly cattle, to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues, such as [[neurotoxicity]], fetal damage and fatal poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Pattanayek, M.|author2=DeShields, B.|name-list-style=amp|title=Characterizing Risks to Livestock from Petroleum Hydrocarbons|url=http://ipec.utulsa.edu/Conf2003/Papers/pattanayek_deshields_29.pdf|publisher=Blasland, Bouck, and Lee, Inc.|access-date=2011-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425161929/http://ipec.utulsa.edu/Conf2003/Papers/pattanayek_deshields_29.pdf|archive-date=2012-04-25|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire surface of an above-ground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach. Pooled petroleum is unambiguous, readily spotted, and indicates the location of required repairs. Because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment, gaps between [[sensors]], and data that requires interpretation, small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected

Pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks. Buried pipes draw fewer complaints. They are [[thermal insulation|insulated]] from extremes in [[ambient temperature]], they are shielded from [[ultraviolet rays]], and they are less exposed to [[photodegradation]]. Buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris, [[electrical storms]], [[tornadoes]], [[hurricanes]], [[hail]], and [[acid rain]]. They are protected from nesting birds, [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] mammals, and stray buckshot. Buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage (e.g. [[automobile accidents|automobile collisions]]) and less accessible to [[vandalism|vandals]], [[saboteurs]], and [[terrorists]].

==Exposure==
Previous work&lt;ref name=&quot;stansbury&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Stansbury|first=John|title=Analysis of Frequency, Magnitude and Consequence of Worst-Case Spills From the Proposed Keystone XL Pipeline|url=http://watercenter.unl.edu/downloads/2011-Worst-case-Keystone-spills-report.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117101558/http://watercenter.unl.edu/downloads/2011-Worst-case-Keystone-spills-report.pdf|archive-date=2015-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that a 'worst-case exposure scenario' can be limited to a specific set of conditions. Based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shut-off [[standard operating procedure|SOP]] developed by TransCanada, the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely.&lt;ref name=&quot;potential&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=US State Dept|title=Potential Releases From Project Construction and Operation and Environmental Consequence Analysis|url=http://www.keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/clientsite/keystonexl.nsf/19_KXL_FEIS_Sec_3.13_Potential_Releases.pdf?OpenFileResource|access-date=2 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detection, shutoff, and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene. Therefore, the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the [[detection limit|limit of detection]] and go unnoticed for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name=stansbury/&gt; Leak detection is monitored through a [[SCADA]] system that assesses pressure and volume flow every 5 seconds. A pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the SCADA system (&lt;1.5% flow) could accumulate into a substantive spill.&lt;ref name=potential/&gt; Detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or [[olfactory]] inspection, aerial surveying, or mass-balance inconsistencies.&lt;ref name=potential/&gt; It is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the 14-day inspection interval, however snow cover and location (e.g. remote, deep) could delay detection. Benzene typically makes up 0.1 – 1.0% of oil and will have varying degrees of [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] and dissolution based on environmental factors.

Even with pipeline leak volumes within SCADA detection limits, sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions, or other problems. The [[Enbridge]] Line 6B [[Enbridge oil spill|crude oil pipeline failure]] in [[Marshall, Michigan]] on July 25, 2010 was thought by operators in Edmonton to be from column separation of the [[dilbit]] in that pipeline. The leak in wetlands along the Kalamazoo River was only confirmed 17 hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in Michigan.

===Spill frequency-volume===
Although the [[Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration]] (PHMSA) has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills, TransCanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design, operation, and safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;potential&quot;/&gt; Whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly 10-fold decrease in spill estimates.&lt;ref name=&quot;stansbury&quot;/&gt; Given that the pipeline crosses 247 miles of the Ogallala Aquifer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US State Dept|title=Environmental Analysis: Water Resources|url=http://www.keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/clientsite/keystonexl.nsf/09_KXL_FEIS_Sec_3.3_Water_Resources.pdf?OpenFileResource|access-date=2 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 14.5% of the entire pipeline length, and the 50-year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between 11 – 91 spills,&lt;ref name=&quot;stansbury&quot;/&gt; approximately 1.6 – 13.2 spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer. An estimate of 13.2 spills over the aquifer, each lasting 14 days, results in 184 days of potential exposure over the 50 year lifetime of the pipeline.
In the reduced-scope worst-case exposure scenario, the volume of a pinhole leak at 1.5% of max flow-rate for 14 days has been estimated at 189,000 barrels or 7.9 million gallons of oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;stansbury&quot;/&gt; According to PHMSA's incident database,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=PHMSA|title=Incident Statistics|url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/library/data-stats/incidents|access-date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 0.5% of all spills in the last 10 years were &gt;10,000 barrels.

===Benzene fate and transport===
[[File:Benzene Transport to Groundwater from Oil Spill.pdf|thumb|300px|Scenario for benzene leaching to groundwater]]
Benzene is considered a light [[aromatic hydrocarbon]] with high solubility and high volatility.{{Clarify|reason = Benzene has a solubility of 1.79 g/L in water at 15 °C. Is this considered high?|date = August 2014}} It is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene, so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil (1% weight by volume) would not volatilize before equilibrating with water.&lt;ref name=&quot;stansbury&quot;/&gt;

Using the [[octanol-water partition coefficient]] and a 100-year precipitation event for the area, a worst-case estimate of 75&amp;nbsp;mg/L of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer.&lt;ref name=&quot;stansbury&quot; /&gt; The actual movement of the [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] through [[groundwater]] systems is not well described, although one estimate is that up to 4.9 billion gallons of water in the Ogallala Aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the MCL.&lt;ref name=&quot;stansbury&quot; /&gt; The Final Environmental Impact Statement from the State Department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize.&lt;ref name=&quot;potential&quot; /&gt;

===Previous dilbit spill remediation difficulties===
One of the major concerns about [[dilbit]] is the difficulty in cleaning it up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=12-P13-00027&amp;segmentID=1 &quot;Kalamazoo River Spill Yields Record Fine&quot;], ''[[Living on Earth]]'', July 6, 2012. Lisa Song, a reporter for Inside Climate News, interviewed by Bruce Gellerman. Retrieved 2013-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Enbridge's Line 6B, a 30-inch crude oil pipeline, ruptured in Marshall, Michigan on July 25, 2010, mentioned above, spilled at least 843,000 gallons of dilbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2012/PAR1201.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928113319/https://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2012/PAR1201.pdf |date=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After detection of the leak, booms and vacuum trucks were deployed. Heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams, and carried dilbit 30 miles downstream before the spill was contained. Remediation work collected over 1.1 million gallons of oil and almost 200,000 cubic yards of oil-contaminated sediment and debris from the Kalamazoo River system. However, oil was still being found in affected waters in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/enbridgespill/ &quot;More Work Needed to Clean up Enbridge Oil Spill in Kalamazoo River&quot;], US EPA, October 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers and environmental impacts==

===Compared to other modes===
Fossil fuels can be transported by pipeline, rail, truck, or ship, though natural gas requires compression or liquification to make vehicle transport economical. For transport of crude oil via these four modes, various reports rank pipelines as proportionately causing less human death and property damage than rail and truck, spilling less oil than truck, and having more environmental impact than truck or rail (mostly due to impact on habitat; ship transport impacts marine habitat to a large degree).&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2014/04/26/pick-your-poison-for-crude-pipeline-rail-truck-or-boat/ |title=Pick Your Poison For Crude -- Pipeline, Rail, Truck Or Boat |author=James Conca |date=26 April 2014 |magazine=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents===
{{Main list|List of pipeline accidents}}

Pipelines conveying flammable or explosive material, such as natural gas or oil, pose special safety concerns.
*1965 – A 32-inch gas transmission pipeline, north of Natchitoches, Louisiana, belonging to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline exploded and burned from [[stress corrosion cracking]] failure on March 4, killing 17 people. At least 9 others were injured, and 7 homes 450 feet from the rupture were destroyed. This accident, and others of the era, led then-President Lyndon B. Johnson to call for the formation of a national pipeline safety agency in 1967. The same pipeline had also had an explosion on May 9, 1955, just 930 feet (280 m) from the 1965 failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.gendisasters.com/louisiana/53/natchitoches-la-gas-pipeline-explosion-mar-1965|title=Natchitoches, LA Gas Pipeline Explosion, Mar 1965|access-date=30 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006104655/http://www3.gendisasters.com/louisiana/53/natchitoches-la-gas-pipeline-explosion-mar-1965|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jiJLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6968,2455002&amp;dq=gas+line+blast&amp;hl=en|title= Google News Archive Search|publisher=The Press-Courier|access-date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

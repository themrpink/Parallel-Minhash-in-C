===Stress===
Earlier Egyptian stresses one of the last two syllables. According to some scholars, that is a development from a stage in Proto-Egyptian in which the third-last syllable could be stressed, which was lost as open posttonic syllables lost their vowels: {{IPA|*/ˈχupiraw/}} &gt; {{IPA|*/ˈχupraw/}} 'transformation'.&lt;ref name=&quot;l37&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptological pronunciation===
As a convention, Egyptologists make use of an &quot;Egyptological pronunciation&quot; in English: the consonants are given fixed values, and vowels are inserted according to essentially arbitrary rules. Two consonants, alef and ayin, are generally pronounced {{IPA|/ɑː/}}. Yodh is pronounced {{IPA|/iː/}}, ''w'' {{IPA|/uː/}}. Between other consonants, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is then inserted. Thus, for example, the name of an Egyptian king is most accurately transliterated as ''Rꜥ-ms-sw'' and transcribed as &quot;Rɑmɛssu&quot;; it means &quot;[[Ra]] has Fashioned (literally, 'Borne') Him&quot;.

In [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|i}}, and {{angbr|u}} all represent consonants; for example, the name [[Tutankhamun]] (1341–1323 BC) was written in Egyptian as ''twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn''. Experts have assigned generic sounds to these values as a matter of convenience, which is an artificial pronunciation and should not be mistaken for how Egyptian was ever pronounced at any time. For example, the name ''twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn'' is conventionally pronounced {{IPAc-en|t|uː|t|ən|ˈ|k|ɑː|m|ə|n}} in English, but, in his lifetime, it was likely to be pronounced something like *{{IPA-sem|taˈwaːtij ˈʕaːnaχ jaˈmaːnuw|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Fecht, Gerhard, ''Wortakzent und Silbenstruktur: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der ägyptischen Sprache'', J. J. Augustin, Glückstadt–Hamburg–New York 1960, §§ 112 A. 194, 254 A. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vergote, Jozef, ''Grammaire Copte'', two vols. Peters, Louvain, 1973-1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osing, J. ''Die Nominalbildung des Ägyptischen''. Deutsches archäologisches Institut, Abteilung Kairo (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schenkel, W., ''Zur Rekonstruktion deverbalen Nominalbildung des Ägyptischen'', Harrasowitz, Wiesbaden 1983, pp. 212, 214, 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Vycichl|1983|pp=10, 224, 250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Vycichl|1990|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;, transliterable as ''tawā́tij-ʿā́nakh-ʾamā́n''.

==Morphology==
Egyptian is fairly typical for an Afroasiatic language in that at the heart of its vocabulary is most commonly a root of three consonants, but there are sometimes only two consonants in the root: rꜥ(w) {{IPA-sem|riːʕa|}} &quot;sun&quot; (the {{IPA|[ʕ]}} is thought to have been something like a voiced pharyngeal fricative). Larger roots are also common and can have up to five consonants: ''sḫdḫd'' &quot;be upside-down&quot;.

Vowels and other consonants are added to the root to derive different meanings, as Arabic, Hebrew, and other Afroasiatic languages still do. However, because vowels and sometimes glides are not written in any Egyptian script except Coptic, it can be difficult to reconstruct the actual forms of words. Thus, orthographic {{angbr|stp}} &quot;to choose&quot;, for example, can represent the [[stative]] (whose endings can be left unexpressed), the [[imperfective]] forms or even a [[verbal noun]] (&quot;a choosing&quot;).

===Nouns===
Egyptian [[noun]]s can be masculine or feminine (the latter is indicated, as with other Afroasiatic languages, by adding a ''-t'') and singular or plural (''-w / -wt''), or dual (''-wy / -ty'').

[[Article (grammar)|Article]]s, both definite and indefinite, do not occur until Late Egyptian but are used widely thereafter.

===Pronouns===
Egyptian has three different types of [[personal pronoun]]s: suffix, [[clitic|enclitic]] (called &quot;dependent&quot; by Egyptologists) and independent pronouns. There are also a number of verbal endings added to the [[infinitive]] to form the stative and are regarded by some linguists&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a &quot;fourth&quot; set of personal pronouns. They bear close resemblance to their Semitic counterparts. The three main sets of personal pronouns are as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable Unicode&quot;
|-
!
!Suffix
!Dependent
!Independent
|-
!1st sg.
|''-ı͗''
|''wı͗''
|''ı͗nk''
|-
!2nd sg. m.
|''-k''
|''tw''
|''ntk''
|-
!2nd sg. f.
|''-t''
|''tn''
|''ntt''
|-
!3rd sg. m.
|''-f''
|''sw''
|''ntf''
|-
!3rd sg. f.
|''-s''
|''sy''
|''nts''
|-
!1st pl.
|''-n''
|''n''
|''ı͗nn''
|-
!2nd pl.
|''-tn''
|''tn''
|''nttn''
|-
!3rd pl.
|''-sn''
|''sn''
|''ntsn''
|}

Demonstrative pronouns have separate masculine and feminine singular forms and common plural forms for both genders:

{| class=&quot;wikitable Unicode&quot;
|-
!Mas.
!Fem.
!Plu.
!Meaning
|-
|''pn''
|''tn''
|''nn''
|this, that, these, those
|-
|''pf''
|''tf''
|''nf''
|that, those
|-
|''pw''
|''tw''
|''nw''
|this, that, these, those (archaic)
|-
|''pꜣ''
|''tꜣ''
|''nꜣ''
|this, that, these, those (colloquial [earlier] &amp; Late Egyptian)
|}

Finally are interrogative pronouns. They bear a close resemblance to their Semitic and [[Berber language|Berber]] counterparts:

{| class=&quot;wikitable Unicode&quot;
|-
!Pronoun
!Meaning
!Dependency
|-
|''mı͗''
|who / what
|Dependent
|-
|''ptr''
|who / what
|Independent
|-
|''iḫ''
|what
|Dependent
|-
|''ı͗šst''
|what
|Independent
|-
|''zı͗''
|which
|Independent &amp; Dependent
|}

===Verbs===
Egyptian verbs have finite and non-finite forms.

Finite verbs convey [[Grammatical person|person]], tense/[[Lexical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]]. Each is indicated by a set of [[affix]]al morphemes attached to the verb: the basic conjugation is ''sḏm.f'' &quot;he hears&quot;.

Non-finite verbs occur without a subject and are the infinitive, the [[participle]]s and the negative infinitive, which ''[[Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs]]'' calls &quot;negatival complement&quot;. There are two main tenses/aspects in Egyptian: [[past tense|past]] and temporally-unmarked [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] and [[aorist]] forms. The latter are determined from their [[syntax|syntactic]] context.

===Adjectives===
[[Adjective]]s agree in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and number with the nouns they modify: ''s nfr'' &quot;(the) good man&quot; and ''st nfrt'' &quot;(the) good woman&quot;.

Attributive adjectives in phrases are after the nouns they modify: &quot;(the) great god&quot; (''nṯr ꜥꜣ'').

However, when they are used independently as a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] in an [[adjectival phrase]], as &quot;(the) god (is) great&quot; (''ꜥꜣ nṯr'') (literally, &quot;great (is the) god&quot;), adjectives precede the nouns they modify.

===Prepositions===
While Afroasiatic, Egyptian makes use of [[preposition]]s, more common in English and other Indo-European languages.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|''m''
|&quot;in, as, with, from&quot;
|-
|''n''
|&quot;to, for&quot;
|-
|''r''
|&quot;to, at&quot;
|-
|''ı͗n''
|&quot;by&quot;
|-
|''ḥnꜥ''
|&quot;with&quot;
|-
|''mı͗''
|&quot;like&quot;
|-
|''ḥr''
|&quot;on, upon&quot;
|-
|''ḥꜣ''
|&quot;behind, around&quot;
|-
|''ẖr''
|&quot;under&quot;
|-
|''tp''
|&quot;atop&quot;
|-
|''ḏr''
|&quot;since&quot;
|}

===Adverbs===
Adverbs, in Egyptian, are at the end of a sentence: in ''zı͗.n nṯr ı͗m'' &quot;the god went there&quot;, &quot;there&quot; (''ı͗m'') is the adverb. Here are some other common Egyptian adverbs:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|''ꜥꜣ''
|&quot;here&quot;
|-
|''ṯnı͗''
|&quot;where&quot;
|-
|''zy-nw''
|&quot;when&quot; (lit. &quot;which moment&quot;)
|-
|''mı͗-ı͗ḫ''
|&quot;how&quot; (lit. &quot;like-what&quot;)
|-
|''r-mı͗''
|&quot;why&quot; (lit. &quot;for what&quot;)
|-
|''ḫnt''
|&quot;before&quot;
|}

==Syntax==
Old Egyptian, Classical Egyptian, and Middle Egyptian have [[verb-subject-object]] as the basic [[word order]]. However, that changed in the later stages of the language, including Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic.

The equivalent to &quot;the man opens the door&quot; would be a sentence that would correspond, in the language's earlier stages, to &quot;opens the man the door&quot; (''wn s ꜥꜣ''). The so-called [[status constructus|construct state]] combines two or more nouns to express the [[genitive]], as in Semitic and [[Berber languages]].

The early stages of Egyptian have no articles, but the later forms use ''pꜣ'', ''tꜣ'' and ''nꜣ''. As with other Afroasiatic languages, Egyptian uses two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. It also uses three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural. However, later Egyptian has a tendency to lose the dual as a productive form.

==Legacy==
{{see|Coptic language#Influence on other languages}}

The Egyptian language survived into the early modern period in the form of the [[Coptic language]]. Coptic survived past the 16th century only as an isolated vernacular.

However, in antiquity, Egyptian exerted some influence on [[Classical Greek]], so that a number of Egyptian loanwords into Greek survive into modern usage. Examples include 
''[[:wikt:ebony|ebony]]'' (Egyptian 𓍁𓈖𓏭𓆱 ''hbny'', via Greek and then Latin), 
''[[:wikt:ivory|ivory]]'' (Egyptian ''ꜣbw'', literally &quot;ivory, elephant&quot;),
''[[:wikt:natron|natron]]'' (via Greek),
''[[:wikt:lily|lily]]'' (Coptic ''hlēri'', via Greek),
''[[:wikt:ibis|ibis]]'' (Egyptian ''hbj'', via Greek),
''[[:wikt:oasis|oasis]]'' (Demotic ''wḥj'', via Greek),
perhaps ''[[:wikt:barge|barge]]'' (Greek [[Wikt:βᾶρις|βᾶρις]] ''baris'' &quot;Egyptian boat&quot; from Coptic ⲃⲁⲁⲣⲉ ''baʔrə'' &quot;small boat&quot; from Egyptian [[Wikt:bꜣjr|bꜣjr]] ),
and possibly ''[[:wikt:cat|cat]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Often assumed to represent the precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ (''šau'' &quot;tomcat&quot;) suffixed with feminine ''-t'', but some authorities dispute this, e.g. John Huehnergard, &quot;Qitta: Arabic Cats&quot;, ''Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and of course a number of terms and proper names directly associated with [[Ancient Egypt]], such as
''[[:wikt:pharaoh|pharaoh]]'' (Egyptian 𓉐𓉻 ''pr-ꜥꜣ'', literally &quot;great house&quot;, transmitted via Hebrew and Greek). The [[Name of Egypt|name ''Egypt'']] itself is etymologically identical to that of the ''[[Copts]]'', ultimately from the [[Late Egyptian]] name of [[Memphis (Egypt)|Memphis]], ''Hikuptah'', a continuation of Middle Egyptian ''{{transl|egy|[[wikt:ḥwt-kꜣ-ptḥ|ḥwt-kꜣ-ptḥ]]}}'' &quot;temple of the [[Egyptian soul|ka (soul)]] of [[Ptah]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Hoffmeier|first =James K|title =Rameses of the Exodus narratives is the 13th B.C. Royal Ramesside Residence|journal =[[Trinity Journal (theology)|Trinity Journal]]|page = 1|date = 1 October 2007|url=http://www.galaxie.com/article/13430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of words in [[Biblical Hebrew]] are also traced to Egyptian;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin J. Noonan, [https://www.bibleinterp.com/PDFs/Noonan.pdf &quot;Egyptian Loanwords as Evidence for the Authenticity of the Exodus and Wilderness Traditions&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; apart from &quot;Pharaoh&quot;, most of these have not entered Greek, Latin or English usage.&lt;ref&gt;A possible exception is ''[[behemoth]]'' (of uncertain etymology, possibly from a presumed ''{{lang|egy|*pꜣ-jḥ-mw}}'' &quot;hippopotamus&quot;, but it may also be a native Semitic word).&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s: first subwoofers===
In September 1964, Raymon Dones, of El Cerrito, California, received the first patent for a subwoofer specifically designed to augment omnidirectionally the low frequency range of modern stereo systems (US patent 3150739). Able to reproduce distortion-free low frequencies down to 15 cycles per second (15&amp;nbsp;Hz), a specific objective of Dones's invention was to provide portable sound enclosures capable of high fidelity reproduction of low frequency sound waves without giving an audible indication of the direction from which they emanated. Dones's loudspeaker was marketed in the US under the trade name &quot;The Octavium&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Octavium Product brochure Aladdin Electronics, Inc. Copyright 1965&lt;/ref&gt; from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s. The Octavium was utilized by several recording artists of that era, most notably the [[Grateful Dead]], bassist [[Monk Montgomery]], bassist [[Nathan East]], and the [[Pointer Sisters]]. The Octavium speaker and Dones's subwoofer technology were also utilized, in a few select theaters, to reproduce low pitch frequencies for the 1974 blockbuster movie ''Earthquake''.  During the late 1960s, Dones's Octavium was favorably reviewed by audiophile publications including ''Hi-Fi News'' and ''Audio Magazine''.

Another early subwoofer enclosure made for home and studio use was the separate bass speaker for the Servo Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archibald, Holt 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/988infinity/index.html|title=Infinity IRS Beta loudspeaker|last=Archibald|first=Larry|author2=J.

The SS-1 received very good reviews in 1970 from ''High Fidelity'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archibald, Holt 2005&quot;/&gt;

Another of the early subwoofers was developed during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, the former president of the Miller &amp; Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end [[electrostatic speakers]] had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Levitin, D. J. |title=The Audio Interview: M&amp;K's Ken Kreisel |journal = [[Audio (magazine)|Audio]] |volume = 80 |date=February 1996 |pages = 28–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinity's full range electrostatic speaker system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.

===1970s to 1980s===
The first use of a subwoofer in a recording session was in 1973 for mixing the [[Steely Dan]] album ''[[Pretzel Logic]]'', when [[recording engineer]] [[Roger Nichols (recording engineer)|Roger Nichols]] arranged for Kreisel to bring a prototype of his subwoofer to [[Village Recorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.stereophile.com/interviews/136/ |journal=Stereophile |date=March 1997 |first=Wes |last=Phillips |title=Audio Odyssey: Ken Kreisel of M&amp;K |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further design modifications were made by Kreisel over the next ten years, and in the 1970s and 1980s by engineer [[John P. D'Arcy]]; [[record producer]] [[Daniel Levitin]] served as a [[consultant]] and &quot;[[golden ear]]s&quot; for the design of the [[Audio crossover|crossover network]] (used to partition the frequency spectrum so that the subwoofer would not attempt to reproduce frequencies too high for its effective range, and so that the main speakers would not need to handle frequencies too low for their effective range). In 1976, Kreisel created the first satellite speakers and subwoofer system, named &quot;David and Goliath&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kreiselsound.com/timeline.php |title=KEN KREISEL HISTORIC TIMELINE |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=www.kreiselsound.com |publisher=Kreisel |access-date=31 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subwoofers received a great deal of publicity in 1974 with the movie [[Earthquake (1974 film)|''Earthquake'']], which was released in [[Sensurround]]. Initially installed in 17 U.S. theaters, the Cerwin Vega &quot;Sensurround&quot; system used large subwoofers that were driven by racks of 500 watt amplifiers, triggered by control tones printed on one of the audio tracks on the film. Four of the subwoofers were positioned in front of the audience under (or behind) the film screen and two more were placed together at the rear of the audience on a platform. Powerful noise energy and loud rumbling in the range of 17&amp;nbsp;Hz to 120&amp;nbsp;Hz were generated at the level of 110–120 decibels of [[Sound pressure|sound pressure level]], abbreviated dB(SPL). The new low frequency entertainment method helped the film become a box office success. More Sensurround systems were assembled and installed. By 1976, there were almost 300 Sensurround systems leapfrogging through select theaters. Other films to use the effect include the WW II naval battle epic [[Midway (1976 film)|''Midway'']] in 1976 and [[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|''Rollercoaster'']] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/2004/69/sensurround/about.htm |title=About Sensurround |work=The 70mm Newsletter |publisher=In70mm.com |date=January 26, 2010 |access-date=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209071217/http://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/2004/69/sensurround/about.htm |archive-date=February 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For owners of 33&amp;nbsp;rpm LPs and 45&amp;nbsp;rpm singles, loud ''and'' deep bass was limited by the ability of the [[phonograph record]] stylus to track the groove.&lt;ref name=&quot;aes.org&quot;/&gt; While some hi-fi aficionados had solved the problem by using other playback sources, such as [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape players]] which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature, with the popular introduction of the compact cassette in the late 1960s it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masterclass Professional Learning&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=44 |work=Record-Producer.com |publisher=Masterclass Professional Learning |date=April 12, 2007 |title=Mastering for vinyl vs. mastering for CD |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821055003/http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=44 |archive-date=August 21, 2007 |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s, 12&quot; vinyl singles, which allowed for &quot;more bass volume&quot;, were used to record disco, reggae, dub and hip-hop tracks; dance club DJs played these records in clubs with subwoofers to achieve &quot;physical and emotional&quot; reactions from dancers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krukowski&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/oped/9667-drop-the-bass-a-case-against-subwoofers/ |title=Drop the Bass: A Case Against Subwoofers |last=Krukowski |first=Damon |date=17 June 2015 |website=pitchfork.com |publisher=Pitchfork |access-date=31 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, [[David Mancuso]] hired sound engineer Alex Rosner&lt;ref name=&quot;Brewster, Bill p. 64&quot;&gt;Brewster, Bill; Broughton, Frank. ''The Record Players: DJ Revolutionaries''. Black Cat. p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; to design additional subwoofers for his disco dance events, along with &quot;tweeter arrays&quot; to &quot;boost the treble and bass at opportune moments&quot; at his private, underground parties at [[The Loft (New York City)|The Loft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence, Tim 2009. p. 204&quot;&gt;Lawrence, Tim. &quot;Beyond the Hustle: Seventies Social Dancing, Discotheque Culture and the Emergence of the Contemporary Club Dancer&quot;. In ''Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy Sham, Shake: A Social and Popular Dance Reader'', ed. Julie Malnig. University of Illinois Press, 2009. p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for sub-bass sound reinforcement in the 1970s was driven by the important role of &quot;powerful bass drum&quot; in disco, as compared with rock and pop; to provide this deeper range, a third crossover point from 40&amp;nbsp;Hz to 120&amp;nbsp;Hz (centering on 80&amp;nbsp;Hz) was added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, Adam J. 2010&quot;/&gt; The [[Paradise Garage]] [[discotheque]] in New York City, which operated from 1977 to 1987, had &quot;custom designed 'sub-bass' speakers&quot; developed by Alex Rosner's disciple, sound engineer Richard (&quot;Dick&quot;) Long &lt;ref name=&quot;Brewster, Bill p. 64&quot;/&gt; that were called &quot;Levan Horns&quot; (in honor of resident [[DJ]] [[Larry Levan]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Krukowski&quot;/&gt;

By the end of the 1970s, subwoofers were used in dance venue sound systems to enable the playing of &quot;[b]ass-heavy dance music&quot; that we &quot;do not 'hear' with our ears but with our entire body&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence, Tim 2009. p. 204&quot;/&gt; At the club, Long used four Levan bass horns, one in each corner of the dancefloor, to create a &quot;haptic and tactile quality&quot; in the sub-bass that you could feel in your body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Papenburg, Jens Gerrit 2016. p. 210&quot;&gt;Papenburg, Jens Gerrit. &quot;Enhanced Bass&quot; in ''Sound as Popular Culture: A Research Companion'', edited by Jens Gerrit Papenburg, Holger Schulze. MIT Press, 2016. p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome the lack of sub-bass frequencies on 1970s disco records (sub-bass frequencies below 60&amp;nbsp;Hz were removed during mastering), Long added a DBX 100 &quot;Boom Box&quot; [[Subharmonic synthesizer|subharmonic pitch generator]] into his system to synthesize 25&amp;nbsp;Hz to 50&amp;nbsp;Hz sub-bass from the 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;Hz bass on the records.&lt;ref name=&quot;Papenburg, Jens Gerrit 2016. p. 210&quot;/&gt;

By the later 1970s, disco club sound engineers were using the same large Cerwin Vega Sensurround-style folded horn subwoofers that were used in ''Earthquake'' and similar movies in dance club system installations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, Adam J. 2010&quot;/&gt; In the early 1980s, Long designed a sound system for the [[Warehouse (nightclub)|Warehouse]] dance club, with &quot;huge stacks of subwoofers&quot; which created &quot;deep and intense&quot; bass frequencies that &quot;pound[ed] through your system&quot; and &quot;entire body&quot;, enabling clubgoers to &quot;viscerally experience&quot; the DJs' [[house music]] mixes.&lt;ref&gt;Salkind, Micah.

[[File:Sound System.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A crew sets up a sound system, including large bass bins, in Jamaica in 2009.]]
In Jamaica in the 1970s and 1980s, sound engineers for [[reggae]] [[sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]]s began creating &quot;heavily customized&quot; subwoofer enclosures by adding foam and tuning the cabinets to achieve &quot;rich and articulate speaker output below 100 Hz&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink, Robert 2018. pp. 104–105&quot;&gt;Fink, Robert. &quot;Below 100 Hz: Towards a Musicology of Bass Culture&quot;.

In sound system culture, there are both &quot;low and high bass bins&quot; in &quot;towering piles&quot; that are &quot;delivered in large trucks&quot; and set up by a crew of &quot;box boys&quot;, and then positioned and adjusted by the sound engineer in a process known as &quot;stringing up&quot;, all to create the &quot;sound of reggae music you can literally feel as it comes off these big speakers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/one-love-traditional-sound-systems-stringing-up-in-the-english-countryside-7932228.html |title=One love: Traditional sound systems 'stringing up' in the English countryside |last=Burrell |first=Ian |date=11 July 2012 |website=www.independent.co.uk |publisher=Independent |access-date=1 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound system crews hold '[[sound clash]]' competitions, where each sound system is set up and then the two crews try to outdo each other,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley&quot;&gt;Stanley Niaah, Sonia (2010) ''DanceHall: From Slave Ship to Ghetto'', University of Ottawa Press, {{ISBN|978-0776607368}}, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; both in terms of loudness and the &quot;bass it produced&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.papermag.com/jamaica-sound-clash-culture-2598768982.html?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2|title=A Brief History of Jamaica's Iconic Sound Clash Culture|last=Rasool |first=Amira  |date=24 August 2018 |website=www.papermag.com |publisher=Paper Mag|access-date=9 January 2019 |quote=As much as sound systems and selectors were important, the speaker systems and the bass it produced, is what gave the battle its edge.

Despite criticism of the AM-5 from audio experts, regarding a lack of bass range below 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, an &quot;acoustic hole&quot; in the 120 to 200&amp;nbsp;Hz range and a lack of upper range above 13&amp;nbsp;kHz for the satellites, the AM-5 system represented 30% of the US speaker market in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feinstein&quot;/&gt;

In the 1980s, Origin Acoustics developed the first residential in-wall subwoofer named Composer. It used an aluminum 10&quot; driver and a foam-lined enclosure designed to be mounted directly into wall studs during the construction of a new home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proaudioinc.com/news/news.php?stID=556 |title=Composer In-Wall Subwoofers |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=proaudioinc.com |publisher=Professional Audio |access-date=23 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency response for the Composer is 30&amp;nbsp;Hz to 250&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pacifichifi.com.au/products/origin-acoustics-composer-csub10nce-wall-subwoofer |title=Origin Acoustics Composer CSUB10NCE In-Wall Subwoofer |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=pacifichifi.com |publisher=Pacific HiFi |access-date=23 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s to 2010s===
While in the 1960s and 1970s deep bass speakers were once an exotic commodity owned by audiophiles, by the mid-1990s they were much more popular and widely used, with different sizes and capabilities of sound output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=L.

The dancefloor's sound system was based on Richard Long's design at Paradise Garage. The club spent about £500,000 on a sound system that used Martin Audio components in custom-built cabinets, including twelve 21&quot; 9,500 watt active subwoofers, twelve 18&quot; subwoofers and twelve Martin Audio W8C mid-high speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whathifi.com/features/inside-story-ministry-sound-sound-system |title=The inside story of the Ministry of Sound sound system |last=Cox |first=Joe |date=30 July 2015 |website=www.whathifi.com |publisher=What Hifi |access-date=2 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of the CD made it possible to add more low frequency content to recordings and satisfy a larger number of consumers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masterclass Professional Learning&quot;/&gt; Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osd.rutgers.edu/gs/06papers/Subwoof.pdf |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |first=Matthew |last=Rodriguez |author2=Erika Ross-O'Brien |author3=Kelli Martino |author4=Vanessa Lannaman |author5=Robert Nahas |author6=Joseph Civitello |author7=Christopher Roselle |author8=Rodrigo Colon |title=Experiences Designing and Building A Subwoofer Amplifier |year=2006 |access-date=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803150020/http://www.osd.rutgers.edu/gs/06papers/Subwoof.pdf |archive-date=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2018, some [[electronic dance music]] (EDM) sound systems for venues that play hardcore bass have multiple subwoofer arrays to deal with mid-bass (80–150&amp;nbsp;Hz), bass (40–80&amp;nbsp;Hz), and &quot;[[Sub-bass|infra-bass]]&quot; (20–40&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref&gt;Fink, Robert. &quot;Below 100 Hz: Towards a Musicology of Bass Culture&quot;.

==Construction and features==

===Loudspeaker and enclosure design===
[[File:Speaker-cross-section.svg|thumb|400px|Cross-section of a subwoofer drive unit.]]
Subwoofers use speaker [[Loudspeaker|drivers]] ([[woofer]]s) typically between 8-inch (20&amp;nbsp;cm) and 21-inch (53&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, and single prototype subwoofers as large as 60-inch (152&amp;nbsp;cm) have been fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/incredible-60-inch-subwoofer |title=Incredible 60-inch (152cm) Subwoofer |date=March 3, 2006 |publisher=Techeblog.com |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10&amp;nbsp;cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends on the design of the [[loudspeaker enclosure]], the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25&amp;nbsp;cm, 30&amp;nbsp;cm, 38&amp;nbsp;cm, and 45&amp;nbsp;cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53&amp;nbsp;cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.

The efficiency of a speaker driver is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_0 = \left(\frac{4 \pi^2 F_s^3 V_{as}}{c^3 Q_{es}}\right)\times100\%&lt;/math&gt;

where the variables are [[Thiele/Small]] parameters. Deep low-frequency extension is a common goal for a subwoofer and small box volumes are also considered desirable, to save space and reduce the size for ease of transportation (in the case of sound reinforcement and DJ subwoofers). [[J. Anton Hofmann|Hofmann]]'s &quot;Iron Law&quot; therefore mandates low efficiency under those constraints, and indeed most subwoofers require considerable power, much more than other individual drivers.

So for the example of a sealed speaker box, the box volume to achieve a given ''Q&lt;sub&gt;ts&lt;/sub&gt;'' is proportional to ''V&lt;sub&gt;as&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;V_b = \frac{V_{as}}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{Q_{tc}^2}{Q_{ts}^2}-1&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, a decrease in box volume (i.e., a smaller speaker cabinet ) and the same ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease the efficiency of the subwoofer. Similarly the ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of a speaker is proportional to ''F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;F_c = \frac{(Q_{tc}F_s)}{Q_{ts}}&lt;/math&gt;

As the efficiency is proportional to ''F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, small improvements in low-frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., [[bass reflex]] designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase the efficiency of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.
[[Image:Bass_reflex_spk.PNG|frame|right|[[Bass reflex]] [[Loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]] schematic (cross-section).]]
[[File:Subwoofer cab internal bracing.jpg|thumb|Heavily braced and built subwoofer enclosure.]]

Subwoofers are typically constructed by mounting one or more woofers in a cabinet of medium-density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, fiberglass, aluminum or other stiff materials.  Because of the high air pressure they produce in the cabinet, subwoofer enclosures often require internal bracing to distribute the resulting forces.

Subwoofers have been designed using a number of enclosure approaches: [[bass reflex]] (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more [[passive radiator speaker]]s in the enclosure, [[acoustic suspension]] (sealed enclosure), [[Loudspeaker enclosure#Infinite baffle|infinite baffle]], [[Horn loudspeaker|horn-loaded]], [[Loudspeaker enclosure#Tapped horn|tapped horn]], [[Loudspeaker enclosure#Transmission line|transmission line]] and [[Loudspeaker enclosure#Compound or band-pass|bandpass]]. Each enclosure type has advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency increase, bass extension, cabinet size, distortion, and cost.

Multiple enclosure types may even be combined in a single design, such as in computer audio with the subwoofer design of the [[Labtec]] LCS-2424 (later acquired by [[Logitech]] and used for their Z340/Z540/Z640/Z3/Z4), which is a (primitive) passive radiator bandpass enclosure with a bass reflex dividing chamber.

While not necessarily an enclosure type, [[Isobaric loudspeaker|isobaric]] (such as push-pull) coupled loading of two drivers has sometimes been used in subwoofer products of computer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techgage.com/article/altec_lansing_fx4021/|title=Altec Lansing FX4021|last=Williams|first=Rob|date=2006-10-30|website=Techgage|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; home cinema&lt;ref&gt;https://genesistechnologies.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ID-SW1-BLS-SW1-Datasheet-Induction-Dynamics_GTUK.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and sound reinforcement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vueaudio.com/products/as-418/|title=as-418 Quad 18-inch Isobaric Subwoofer|date=2012-09-11|website=VUE Audiotechnik|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; class, and also DIY versions in automotive applications, to provide relatively deep bass for their size. Self-contained &quot;isobaric-like&quot; driver assemblies have been manufactured since the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tb-speaker.com/products/w3-2108|title=W3-2108 – 3&quot; PP Subwoofer – TB SPEAKER CO., LTD.|website=www.tb-speaker.com|access-date=2020-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.parts-express.com/pedocs/specs/264-955--tang-band-w8-2022-spec-sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.parts-express.com/pedocs/tech-diagrams/Tang%20Band%20RBM%20Subwoofer%20Cutaway.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest subwoofers are typically those designed for desktop multimedia systems. The largest common subwoofer enclosures are those used for concert sound reinforcement systems or dance club sound systems.  An example of a large concert subwoofer enclosure is the 1980s-era Electro-Voice MT-4 &quot;Bass Cube&quot; system, which used four 18-inch (45&amp;nbsp;cm) drivers. An example of a subwoofer that uses a bass horn is the Bassmaxx B-Two, which loads an 18-inch (45&amp;nbsp;cm) driver onto an {{convert|11|ft|adj=on}} long folded horn. Folded horn-type subwoofers can typically produce a deeper range with greater efficiency than the same driver in an enclosure that lacks a horn. However, folded horn cabinets are typically larger and heavier than front-firing enclosures, so folded horns are less commonly used. Some experimental fixed-installation subwoofer horns have been constructed using brick and concrete to produce a very long horn that allows a very deep sub-bass extension.&lt;ref name=Gordon2008/&gt;

Subwoofer output level can be increased by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs necessarily involve tradeoffs and compromises. Hofmann's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume (as in size) and to the cube of its cutoff frequency, that is how low in pitch it will go) applies to subwoofers just as it does to all loudspeakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ldsg.snippets.org/appdx-a.php#HOFMANN |work=DIY Loudspeaker Designer's Selection Guide (the LDSG) |last=Stout |first=Bob |title=Hofmans's Iron Law |date=March 25, 2007 |access-date=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305171316/http://ldsg.snippets.org/appdx-a.php#HOFMANN |archive-date=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a subwoofer enclosure designer aiming at the deepest-pitched bass will probably have to consider using a large enclosure size; a subwoofer enclosure designer instructed to create the smallest possible cabinet (to make transportation easier) will need to compromise how low in pitch their cabinet will go.

===Frequency range and frequency response===
[[File:Final12hw6.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A large subwoofer cabinet used in a home [[hi-fi]] system.]]
The frequency response specification of a speaker describes the range of frequencies or musical tones a speaker can reproduce, measured in [[hertz]] (Hz).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.ecoustics.com/bbs/messages/34579/131062.html |last=Dicomo |first=Paul |title=Understanding Speaker Frequency Response: The Secret Behind The Industry's Most-Cited Spec |publisher=Ecoustics.com |date=April 9, 2005 |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The typical frequency range for a subwoofer is between 20–200&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrutchfieldGlossary&quot;/&gt; Professional concert sound system subwoofers typically operate below 100&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref name=Young2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/in_depth_the_aux_fed_subwoofer_technique_explained/ |title=In-Depth: The Aux-Fed Subwoofer Technique Explained |last=Young |first=Tom |date=December 1, 2008 |work=Study Hall |publisher=ProSoundWeb |pages=1–2 |accessdate=March 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[THX]]-certified systems operate below 80&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=DellaSala/&gt;  Subwoofers vary in terms of the range of pitches that they can reproduce, depending on a number of factors such as the size of the cabinet and the construction and design of the enclosure and driver(s). Specifications of frequency response depend wholly for relevance on an accompanying amplitude value—measurements taken with a wider amplitude tolerance will give any loudspeaker a wider frequency response. For example, the JBL 4688 TCB Subwoofer System, a now-discontinued system which was designed for movie theaters, had a frequency response of 23–350&amp;nbsp;Hz when measured within a 10-decibel boundary (0&amp;nbsp;dB to &amp;minus;10&amp;nbsp;dB) and a narrower frequency response of 28–120&amp;nbsp;Hz when measured within a 6-decibel boundary (±3&amp;nbsp;dB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jblpro.com/pub/obsolete/4688.pdf |publisher=JBL Professional Audio |title=4688 TCB Subwoofer System |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subwoofers also vary in regard to the sound pressure levels achievable and the distortion levels that they produce over their range. Some subwoofers, such as &quot;The Abyss&quot; by [[MartinLogan]] for example, can reproduce pitches down to around 18&amp;nbsp;Hz (which is about the pitch of the lowest rumbling notes on a huge pipe organ with {{convert|32|ft|adj=on}}-16&amp;nbsp;Hz-bass pipes) to 120&amp;nbsp;Hz (±3&amp;nbsp;dB). Nevertheless, even though the Abyss subwoofer can go down to 18&amp;nbsp;Hz, its lowest frequency and maximum SPL with a limit of 10% distortion is 35.5&amp;nbsp;Hz and 79.8&amp;nbsp;dB at 2 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.soundandvision.com/content/martinlogan-feature-powered-speaker-and-abyss-subwoofer-page-3 |journal=Sound and Vision |title=MartinLogan Feature powered speaker and Abyss subwoofer: Test report |last=Butterworth |first=Brent |date=June 2009 |accessdate=April 21, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a person choosing a subwoofer needs to consider more than just the lowest pitch that the subwoofer can reproduce.

===Amplification===
[[File:Aktives Subwoofer Modul.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This picture of the internal components of an active (powered) subwoofer shows the circuitry for the [[power amplifier]].]]
'Active subwoofers' include their own dedicated amplifiers within the cabinet. Some also include user-adjustable [[#Equalization|equalization]] that allows boosted or reduced output at particular frequencies; these vary from a simple &quot;boost&quot; switch, to fully [[parametric equalizer]]s meant for detailed speaker and room correction. Some such systems are even supplied with a calibrated microphone to measure the subwoofer's in-room response, so the automatic equalizer can correct the combination of subwoofer, subwoofer location, and room response to minimize the effects of room modes and improve low-frequency performance.

[[File:Final05jm1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|This rear panel of a powered subwoofer shows the [[heat sink]]s used to cool the [[power amplifier]].]]
'Passive subwoofers' have a subwoofer driver and enclosure, but they do not include an amplifier. They sometimes incorporate internal passive crossovers, with the filter frequency determined at the factory. These are generally used with third-party power amplifiers, taking their inputs from active crossovers earlier in the signal chain. Inexpensive [[Home Theatre in a Box]] packages often come with a passive subwoofer cabinet that is amplified by the multi-channel amplifier. While few high-end [[Home cinema|home-theater]] systems use passive subwoofers, this format is still popular in the professional sound industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jblpro.com/pub/manuals/pssdm_2.pdf |title=JBL Sound System Design Manual, part two |year=1999 |publisher=JBL Professional Audio |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equalization===
[[File:Rear panel of a Polk audio sub-woofer.jpg|thumb|right|220px|This picture of the rear panel of a Polk subwoofer cabinet shows a low-pass filter adjustment knob.]]

Equalization can be used to adjust the in-room response of a subwoofer system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10tenmag.com/best-car-subwoofer/ |last=Corner |first=Ten |work=Ultra Audio |publisher=10TenMag |title=Best Car Subwoofer System |date=July 15, 2016 |accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designers of active subwoofers sometimes include a degree of corrective equalization to compensate for known performance issues (e.g., a steeper than desired low end [[roll-off]] rate). In addition, many amplifiers include an adjustable low-pass filter, which prevents undesired higher frequencies from reaching the subwoofer driver. For example, if a listener's main speakers are usable down to 80&amp;nbsp;Hz, then the subwoofer filter can be set so the subwoofer only works below 80&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=DellaSala/&gt; Typical filters involve some overlap in frequency ranges; a steep 4th-order 24 dB/octave low-pass filter is generally desired for subwoofers in order to minimize the overlap region. The filter section may also include a high-pass &quot;[[infrasound|infrasonic]]&quot; or &quot;subsonic&quot; filter, which prevents the subwoofer driver from attempting to reproduce frequencies below its safe capabilities. Setting an infrasonic filter is important on bass reflex subwoofer cabinets, as the bass reflex design tends to create the risk of cone overexcursion at pitches below those of the port tuning, which can cause distortion and damage the subwoofer driver. For example, in a ported subwoofer enclosure tuned to 30&amp;nbsp;Hz, one may wish to filter out pitches below the tuning frequency; that is, frequencies below 30&amp;nbsp;Hz.

Some systems use parametric equalization in an attempt to correct for room frequency response irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultraaudio.com/equipment/bang_olufsen_beolab_5.htm |last=Messenger |first=Paul |work=Ultra Audio |publisher=Schneider Publishing |title=Bang &amp; Olufsen Beolab 5 Loudspeakers |date=July 15, 2004 |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations, in part because of the resonance (i.e., [[standing wave]]) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etfacoustic.com/basics.html |title=Audio Measurement Basics |year=2000 |first=Doug |last=Plumb |publisher=Acousti Soft Inc. |access-date=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312102439/http://www.etfacoustic.com/basics.html |archive-date=March 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harman.com/EN-US/OurCompany/Technologyleadership/Documents/White%20Papers/multsubs.pdf |first=Todd |last=Welti |publisher=Harman International Industries, Inc |title=Subwoofers: Optimum Number and Locations |date=October 30, 2002 |access-date=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415024620/http://www.harman.com/EN-US/OurCompany/Technologyleadership/Documents/White%20Papers/multsubs.pdf |archive-date=April 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase control===
[[File:Subwoofer downfiring.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The rear panel of a down-firing, active subwoofer cabinet.]]
Changing the relative phase of the subwoofer with respect to the woofers in other speakers may or may not help to minimize unwanted destructive acoustic interference in the frequency region covered by both the subwoofer and the main speakers. It may not help at all frequencies, and may create further problems with frequency response, but even so is generally provided as an adjustment for subwoofer amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sound.whsites.net/pcmm.htm |first=Rod |last=Elliott |publisher=Elliott Sound Products |title=Phase Correction – Myth or Magic |date=March 2, 2004 |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase control circuits may be a simple polarity reversal switch or a more complex continuously variable circuit.

Continuously variable phase control circuits are common in subwoofer amplifiers, and may be found in crossovers and as [[do-it-yourself]] electronics projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sound.whsites.net/project103.htm |first=Rod |last=Elliott |publisher=Elliott Sound Products |title=Subwoofer Phase Controller |date=January 18, 2004 |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul02/articles/subwoofers.asp |journal=Sound on Sound |title=Choosing &amp; Installing a Subwoofer |date=July 2002 |last=Nicholls |first=Mallory |publisher=SOS Publications Group |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audioholics.com/tweaks/get-good-bass/the-marriage-between-the-subwoofer-and-tower-speakers |publisher=Audioholics |first=Gene |last=DellaSala |title=The Marriage Between the Subwoofer and Tower Speakers |date=August 29, 2004 |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.

The subwoofer phase can still be changed by moving the subwoofer closer to or further from the listening position, however this may not be always practical.

===Servo subwoofers===
Some active subwoofers use a servo feedback mechanism based on cone movement that modifies the signal sent to the voice coil. The servo feedback signal is derived from a comparison of the input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based [[accelerometer]] placed on the cone itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rythmikaudio.com/technology.html |publisher=Rythmik Audio |title=Technology |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyrille.pinton.free.fr/electroac/lectures_utiles/asservissement/acceleration/SubServoAccelDoucet.pdf |publisher=Analog Devices |last=Doucet |first=Douglas |author2=Rob Fasani |author3=Peter Hasenkamp |author4=Matthew Senesky |title=Using an Accelerometer to Make an Active Subwoofer |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_11_2/diy-14-rythmik-directservo-subwoofer-4-2004.html |publisher=Home Theater Hi-Fi |last=Calabria |first=Ralph |title=Rythmik Direct Servo Powered Subwoofer Kit |date=April 2004 |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateavmag.com/speakersystems/1204velodyne/ |last=Deutsch |first=Robert |publisher=Ultimate AV |title=Velodyne Digital Drive DD-12 subwoofer |date=December 2004 |access-date=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831095726/http://ultimateavmag.com/speakersystems/1204velodyne/ |archive-date=August 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Servo-controlled subwoofers are not the same as [[Tom Danley]]'s ServoDrive subwoofers, whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven [[servomotor]]. The ServoDrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates [[power compression]], the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil. This feature allows high-power operation for extended periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=11721 |work=AES E-Library |title=A High Efficiency Servo-Motor Driven Subwoofer |last=Danley |first=Thomas J. |author-link1=Tom Danley |author2=Charles A.

==Applications==

===Home audio===
[[File:Subwoofer.jpg|thumb|Basic sealed subwoofer in a residential setting.]]
The use of a subwoofer augments the bass capability of the main speakers, and allows them to be smaller without sacrificing low-frequency capability. A subwoofer does not necessarily provide superior bass performance in comparison to large conventional loudspeakers on ordinary music recordings due to the typical lack of very low frequency content on such sources. However, there are recordings with substantial low-frequency content that most conventional loudspeakers are ill-equipped to handle without the help of a subwoofer, especially at high playback levels, such as music for [[pipe organ]]s with 32' (9.75 meter) bass pipes (16&amp;nbsp;Hz), very large bass drums on symphony orchestra recordings and electronic music with extremely low [[synth bass]] parts, such as [[bass test]]s or [[bass song]]s.

Frequencies which are sufficiently low are not easily [[Sound localization|localized]] by humans, hence many stereo and multichannel audio systems feature only one subwoofer channel and a single subwoofer can be placed off-center without affecting the perceived sound stage, since the sound that it produces will be difficult to localize. The intention in a system with a subwoofer is often to use small main speakers (of which there are two for stereo and five or more for surround sound or movie tracks) and to hide the subwoofer elsewhere (e.g. behind furniture or under a table), or to augment an existing speaker to save it from having to handle woofer-destroying low frequencies at high levels. This effect is possible only if the subwoofer is restricted to quite low frequencies, usually taken to be, say, 100&amp;nbsp;Hz and below—still less localization is possible if restricted to even lower maximum frequencies.  Higher upper limits for the subwoofer (e.g., 125&amp;nbsp;Hz) are much more easily localized, making a single subwoofer impractical. [[Home cinema|Home theatre]] systems typically use one subwoofer cabinet (the &quot;1&quot; in [[5.1 surround sound]]). However, to &quot;improve bass distribution in a room that has multiple seating locations, and prevent &quot;node&quot; or &quot;null points&quot; with weakened bass response, some home cinema enthusiasts use &quot;5.2&quot; or &quot;7.2&quot; surround sound systems with two subwoofer cabinets in the same room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.crutchfield.com/S-qmtko5g1er8/learn/learningcenter/home/speakers_subwoofers.html |title=Home theater subwoofers buying guide How to choose the right one for your surround sound system |last=Crane |first=Kramer |website=www.crutchfield.com |publisher=Crutchfield |access-date= 9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some users add a subwoofer because high levels of low-frequency bass are desired, even beyond what is in the original recording, as in the case of [[house music]] enthusiasts. Thus, subwoofers may be part of a package that includes satellite speakers, may be purchased separately, or may be built into the same cabinet as a conventional speaker system. For instance, some floor-standing tower speakers include a subwoofer driver in the lower portion of the same cabinet. Physical separation of subwoofer and &quot;satellite&quot; speakers not only allows placement in an inconspicuous location, but since [[sub-bass]] frequencies are particularly sensitive to room location (due to room resonances and reverberation 'modes'), the best position for the subwoofer is not likely to be where the &quot;satellite&quot; speakers are located.

For greatest efficiency and best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers can be placed in a corner of the room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long [[wavelength]]; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low-frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it is possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel's speaker is out of phase with another.

The physically separate subwoofer/satellite arrangement, with small satellite speakers and a large subwoofer cabinet that can be hidden behind furniture, has been popularized by multimedia speaker systems such as [[Bose Acoustimass Home Entertainment Systems]], [[Polk Audio]] RM2008 Series and [[Klipsch Audio Technologies]] ProMedia, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polkaudio.com/homeaudio/rm2008/ |publisher=Polk Audio |title=RM Series |access-date=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131132247/http://www.polkaudio.com/homeaudio/rm2008/ |archive-date=January 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.klipsch.com/products/details/promedia-ultra-5-1.aspx |publisher=Klipsch |title=ProMedia Ultra 5.1 |access-date=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305144331/http://www.klipsch.com/products/details/promedia-ultra-5-1.aspx |archive-date=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Low-cost &quot;[[home theater in a box]]&quot; systems advertise their integration and simplicity.
[[File:Subwoofer Genius 2.1 360(2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A small subwoofer cabinet designed for use with a home computer.]]
Particularly among lower cost &quot;[[Home Theater in a Box]]&quot; systems and with &quot;boom boxes&quot;, however, the inclusion of a subwoofer may be little more than a marketing technique. It is unlikely that a small woofer in an inexpensively-built compact plastic cabinet will have better bass performance than well-designed conventional (and typically larger) speakers in a plywood or MDF cabinet. Mere use of the term &quot;subwoofer&quot; is no guarantee of good or extended bass performance. Many multimedia &quot;subwoofers&quot; might better be termed &quot;mid bass cabinets&quot; (60&amp;nbsp;Hz to 160&amp;nbsp;Hz), as they are too small to produce deep bass in the 30&amp;nbsp;Hz to 59&amp;nbsp;Hz range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bestproductspro.com/10-inch-subwoofers/|title=Absolute Best 10-Inch Subwoofers in 2018|date=2018-03-29|work=Best Products Pro|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, poorly-designed systems often leave everything below about 120&amp;nbsp;Hz (or even higher) to the subwoofer, meaning that the subwoofer handles frequencies which the ear can use for sound source localization, thus introducing an undesirable subwoofer &quot;localization effect&quot;.

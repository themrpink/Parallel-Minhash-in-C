This was primarily to maximise the footballer's potential; players tried out every outfield position before finding one that suited them best.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt; Every age group at Ajax played in the same style and formation as the first team – [[Formation (association football)#3.E2.80.934.E2.80.933|3–4–3]] – to allow individuals to slot in without effort when moving up the pyramid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt; Bergkamp &quot;played in every position apart from [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalie]]&quot; and believed he benefited from the experience of playing as a defender, as it helped him &quot;know how they think and how to beat them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt; When he made his debut as a substitute against Roda JC, Bergkamp was positioned on the [[Midfielder#Winger|right wing]], where he remained for three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt;

During his time at Inter Milan, Bergkamp was switched to the position of a main [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], but failed to cooperate with his offensive partner Rubén Sosa, whom he later called &quot;selfish&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, due to his introverted character, he was accused of lacking consistency and leadership skills by the Italian press, and struggled to replicate his previous form during his time with Inter.&lt;ref name=&quot;FourFourTwo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-07/sports/sp-12912_1_world-cup|title=WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS : A Happy 'Kamper : Dutch Forward Bergkamp Feeling More Confident|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|author1=Helene Elliot|date=7 July 1994|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=treccani&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dennis-bergkamp_%28Enciclopedia_dello_Sport%29/|title=BERGKAMP, Dennis|publisher=Treccani.it|language=Italian|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Bergkamp joined Arsenal in 1995, he enjoyed a successful strike partnership with Wright, and in later seasons [[Nicolas Anelka|Anelka]] and Henry, playing in his preferred position as a creative [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/thierry-henry-arsenal-most-premier-league-assists-season-200203-van-nistelrooy-golden-boot |title=Thierry Henry's assist record of 2002/03: how Arsenal's talisman reinvented the Premier League striker |publisher=FourFourTwo |last1=Haugstad |first1=Thore |date=25 October 2019 |accessdate=21 January 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of Overmars in the 1997–98 season enhanced Bergkamp's play, as he was getting more of the ball. Between August and October 1997, he scored seven goals in seven league matches.{{sfn|Palmer|p=81}} A similar rapport developed between him and Ljungberg during the 2001–02 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tele&quot;/&gt;

There, it was a case of two strikers up against four or five hard defenders who would stop at nothing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt; Bergkamp says his aggression often stems from frustration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt;

==Reception==
Bergkamp has received several accolades during his playing career. He twice finished in third place for the [[1993 FIFA World Player of the Year|1993]] and [[1997 FIFA World Player of the Year|1996]] [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award and was named in [[FIFA 100]], a list compiled by footballer [[Pelé]] of the 125 greatest living footballers.&lt;ref name=Fifa100&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/mar/04/newsstory.sport15 |title=The Fifa 100 |date=4 March 2004 |accessdate=15 December 2011 |work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his club career, Bergkamp won two successive [[Dutch Footballer of the Year]] awards in 1991 and 1992 and was the [[Eredivisie#Top scorers|Eredivisie top scorer]] for three consecutive seasons (1990–91 to 1992–93). He was named the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] and [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] in April and May 1998 and made the [[PFA Team of the Year]] for the 1997–98 season. Bergkamp also achieved a unique feat in being voted first, second and third on [[Match of the Day]]'s [[BBC Goal of the Month|Goal of the Month]] competition in August 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Joy of Six: classiest hat-tricks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/11/newsstory.sport9 |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |location=London |date=11 September 2007 |accessdate=18 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his national team, Bergkamp was the top scorer at Euro 1992 and was selected in the [[FIFA World Cup awards#All-Star Team|FIFA World Cup All-Star Team]] for the 1998 World Cup.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In April 2007, Bergkamp was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] by viewers of BBC's ''[[Football Focus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/dennis-bergkand-voted-into-hall-of-fame |title=Dennis Bergkamp voted into Hall of Fame |date=3 September 2007 |accessdate=15 December 2011 |publisher=Arsenal.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603204724/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/dennis-bergkand-voted-into-hall-of-fame |archivedate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he was voted second by Arsenal fans behind Thierry Henry in a list of the ''50 Gunners Greatest Players''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunners' Greatest&quot;/&gt; In February 2014, Arsenal unveiled a statue of Bergkamp outside the Emirates Stadium to honour his time at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenal unveil Dennis Bergkamp statue|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-26303200|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 October 2014|date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Dennis Bergkamp will be erected outside the KNVB headquarters in [[Zeist]], as he has been chosen as the best Dutch international player from 1990 to 2015.

==Coaching career==
Upon retiring, Bergkamp insisted he would not move into coaching. He turned down an offer to scout for Arsenal and instead concentrated on travelling and spending time with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p6sf2 | title=Sportsweek, 06/12/2009 | publisher=[[BBC Radio 5 Live]] | accessdate=30 April 2012 | date=6 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 2008, he began a fast-track coaching diploma for former Dutch international footballers and undertook a trainee role at Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article3716438.ece | title=Dennis Bergkamp ends two-year exile from game | newspaper=[[The Times]] | accessdate=10 April 2008 | location=London | first=Gary | last=Jacob | date=10 April 2008}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ajaxtrainee&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11906_3428268,00.html | title=Bergkamp offered Ajax post | work=[[Sky Sports]] | date=15 April 2008 |accessdate=16 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having completed the Coach Betaald Voetbal course by the [[Royal Dutch Football Association]] (KNVB), Bergkamp was appointed assistant to [[Johan Neeskens]] for the newly formed [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands B team]] on 26 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neeskens to lead Netherlands B team |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ned/news/newsid=766646.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=25 October 2008 |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2008–09 AFC Ajax season|2008–09 season]], Bergkamp returned to Ajax in a formal coaching position with responsibility for the D2 (U12) youth team. Following the promotion of Frank de Boer as manager of Ajax in December 2010, Bergkamp was appointed assistant manager to [[Fred Grim]], dealing with Ajax' flagship A1 (U19) youth team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://english.ajax.nl/News/Archive/Article/Updates-to-youth-teams-training-staff.htm | title=Updates to youth teams' training staff | work=Ajax.nl | date=4 January 2011 | accessdate=30 April 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021190012/http://english.ajax.nl/News/Archive/Article/Updates-to-youth-teams-training-staff.htm | archivedate=21 October 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Bergkamp was named De Boer's assistant at Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Higgins |first1=Marcus |title=Former Arsenal striker Dennis Bergkamp appointed Ajax assistant coach |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/1686/eredivisie/2011/06/29/2552793/former-arsenal-striker-dennis-bergkamp-appointed-ajax |website=goal.com |date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the arrival of [[Peter Bosz]] as the new head coach at Ajax, Bergkamp's role at Ajax slightly changed. He no longer sat on the bench during first-team matches, but instead focused more on field training and on helping youth players reach the first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.ajaxshowtime.com/article/hoofdnieuws/97451/bergkamp-niet-meer-op-de-bank-als-assistent#T3TmUBVsCsilYJOb.97 | title=Bergkamp no longer on assistant's bench | work=Ajaxshowtime.com | date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=10 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He and fellow assistant [[Hennie Spijkerman]] were sacked from their roles in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Ajax sack assistant Dennis Bergkamp in coaching clear-out | work = BBC Sport | date = 21 December 2017 | accessdate = 21 December 2017 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42445727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bergkamp has been married to Henrita Ruizendaal since 16 June 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.anp-archief.nl/page/2246767/nl |title=Historisch Archief Community |date=16 June 1993 |accessdate=15 December 2011 |work=[[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau]] |last=Bastiaanse |first=Arthur |language=Dutch |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426054822/http://www.anp-archief.nl/page/2246767/nl |archivedate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have four children: Estelle Deborah, Mitchel Dennis, Yasmin Naomi and Saffron Rita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1998/09/12/phead.htm |title=Bergkamp's treasure tops all his goals |date=12 September 1998 |accessdate=15 December 2011 |newspaper=Irish Examiner |location=Cork |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050509081143/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1998/09/12/phead.htm |archivedate=9 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vorige.nrc.nl/sport/article1705105.ece|title=Dennis omarmd in zijn eigen wonderland|date=24 July 2006|accessdate=15 December 2011|newspaper=NRC Handelsblad|language=Dutch|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603125813/http://vorige.nrc.nl/sport/article1705105.ece|archivedate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nephew, [[Roland Bergkamp]], currently plays for [[RKC Waalwijk]], having previously played for [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/brighton/9527797.stm |title=Dennis Bergkamp nephew Roland joins Brighton |date=1 July 2011 |accessdate=30 April 2012 |work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks fluent Dutch (his mother tongue), English and Italian.

===Aviophobia===
Bergkamp's nickname is the &quot;Non-[[Flying Dutchman]]&quot; due to his [[fear of flying]]. Contemporary sources believed that this stemmed from incidents with the Netherlands national team at the 1994 World Cup where the engine of the plane cut out during a flight,&lt;ref name = &quot;fear revealed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2280779.stm|title=Bergkamp's fear revealed|date=25 September 2002|accessdate=12 December 2011|work=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt; and when a flight was delayed because a journalist made a joke about having a bomb in his bag.&lt;ref name=&quot;flying&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-bergkamp-admits-to-flying-phobia-1356877.html |title=Bergkamp admits to flying phobia |date=5 October 1996 |accessdate=28 May 2016 |newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2013 autobiography, Bergkamp stated that his phobia was in fact caused by his time at Inter Milan, in which they regularly travelled to away games in small aeroplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wallace |first1=Sam |title=Dennis Bergkamp autobiography reveals rows with Arsene Wenger that marred his latter days at Arsenal |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/dennis-bergkamp-autobiography-reveals-rows-with-arsene-wenger-that-marred-his-latter-days-at-arsenal-8837562.html |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=The Independent |date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergkamp decided he would never fly again but did consider seeking psychiatric help:&lt;blockquote&gt;I've got this problem and I have to live with it. I can't do anything about it, it is a psychological thing and I can't explain it. I have not flown on a plane for two years. The Dutch FA has been sympathetic, so have Arsenal, so far. I am considering psychiatric help. I can't fly. I just freeze. I get panicky. It starts the day before, when I can't sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;flying&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The condition severely limited his ability to play in away matches in European competitions and to travel with the national team. In some cases, he would travel overland by car or train, but the logistics of some matches were such that he would not travel at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;fear revealed&quot;/&gt; In the build-up to Arsenal's Champions League match against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in February 2001, Wenger spoke of his concerns for Bergkamp travelling by train and car, because of the exertions involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/2998733/Wenger-might-quit-Arsenal-over-EU.html|title=Wenger might quit Arsenal over EU|first=Christopher|last=Davies|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 February 2001 |accessdate=12 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

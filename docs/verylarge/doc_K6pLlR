Kate Chopin is an example of a revisionist myth-maker because she revises myth more realistically about marriage and female sexuality of her time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:522&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shurbutt|first=Sylvia Bailey|title=The Can River Characters and Revisionist Mythmaking in the Work of Kate Chopin|journal=The Southern Literary|volume=68|pages=14–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest myth Chopin focused on was the &quot;Victorian notion of women's somewhat anemic sexuality&quot; and [[The Storm (short story)|&quot;The Storm&quot;]] is the best example of Kate Chopin using that myth through a character set on fulfilling her complete sexual potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;:522&quot; /&gt; For instance, in [[The Storm (short story)|&quot;The Storm&quot;]],  portraits of women were revised by Kate Chopin to obtain consummation in roles other than marriage to evince a passionate nature considered inappropriate by conventional, patriarchal standards of Victorian America.&lt;ref name=&quot;:522&quot; /&gt;

Chopin went beyond Maupassant's technique and style to give her writing its own flavor. She had an ability to perceive life and creatively express it. She concentrated on women's lives and their continual struggles to create an identity of their own within the [[Southern United States|Southern]] society of the late nineteenth century. For instance, in &quot;[[The Story of an Hour]]&quot;, Mrs. Mallard allows herself time to reflect after learning of her husband's death. Instead of dreading the lonely years ahead, she stumbles upon another realization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.&lt;ref name=story/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not many writers during the mid- to late 19th century were bold enough to address subjects that Chopin took on. [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], of Emory University, wrote that &quot;Kate was neither a feminist nor a suffragist, she said so. She was nonetheless a woman who took women extremely seriously. She never doubted women's ability to be strong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Kate Chopin: A Re-Awakening''. [https://www.pbs.org/katechopin/interviews.html &quot;Interview: Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, Emory University&quot;]. March 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Kate Chopin's sympathies lay with the individual in the context of his and her personal life and society.

Through her stories, Chopin wrote a kind of autobiography and described her societies; she had grown up in a time when her surroundings included the [[abolitionist]] movements before the [[American Civil War]], and their influence on [[freedmen]] education and rights afterward, as well as the emergence of feminism. Her ideas and descriptions were not reporting, but her stories expressed the reality of her world.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;/&gt;

Chopin took strong interest in her surroundings and wrote about many of her observations. Jane Le Marquand assesses Chopin's writings as a new feminist voice, while other intellectuals recognize it as the voice of an individual who happens to be a woman. Marquand writes, &quot;Chopin undermines patriarchy by endowing the Other, the woman, with an individual identity and a sense of self, a sense of self to which the letters she leaves behind give voice.  The 'official' version of her life, that constructed by the men around her, is challenged and overthrown by the woman of the story.&quot;&lt;ref name=lemarquand/&gt;

Chopin appeared to express her belief in the strength of women. Marquand draws from theories about creative nonfiction in terms of her work. In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, there has to be a nonfictional element, but more often than not the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers. Kate Chopin might have been surprised to know her work has been characterized as feminist in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, just as she had been in her own time to have it described as immoral. Critics tend to regard writers as individuals with larger points of view addressed to factions in society.&lt;ref name=lemarquand/&gt;

=== Early works ===
Kate Chopin began her writing career with her first story published in the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larrabee|first=Denise|title=Chopin, Kate 1850-1904|journal=American Writers, Retrospective Supplement 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.katechopin.org/biography/|title=Kate Chopin Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1890s, Chopin forged a successful writing career, contributing short stories and articles to local publications and literary journals. She also initially wrote a number of short stories such as &quot;A Point at Issue!&quot;, &quot;A No-Account Creole&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Bayou&quot; which were published in various magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt; In 1890, her first novel &quot;At Fault&quot; about a young widow and the sexual constraints of women was published privately.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt; The protagonist demonstrates the initial theme of Kate Chopin's works when she began writing. In 1892, Kate Chopin produced &quot;[[Désirée's Baby]]&quot;, &quot;Ripe Figs&quot;  and &quot;At the 'Cadian Ball&quot; which appeared in ''Two Tales'' that year, and eight of her other stories were published.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt;

The short story &quot;Désirée's Baby&quot; focuses on Kate Chopin's experience with miscegenation and communities of the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]] of color in Louisiana. She came of age when slavery was institutionalized in St. Louis and the South. In Louisiana, there had been communities established of [[free people of color]], especially in New Orleans, where formal arrangements were made between white men and free women of color or enslaved women for [[plaçage]], a kind of common-law marriage. There and in the country, she lived with a society based on the history of slavery and the continuation of plantation life, to a great extent.  Mixed-race people (also known as [[mulattos]]) were numerous in New Orleans and the South. This story addresses the racism of 19th century America; persons who were visibly European-American could be threatened by the revelation of also having African ancestry. Chopin was not afraid to address such issues, which were often suppressed and intentionally ignored. Her character Armand tries to deny this reality, when he refuses to believe that he is of partial black descent, as it threatens his ideas about himself and his status in life. R. R. Foy believed that Chopin's story reached the level of great fiction, in which the only true subject is &quot;human existence in its subtle, complex, true meaning, stripped of the view with which ethical and conventional standards have draped it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Foy, R.R. |title=Chopin's Desiree's Baby|journal=Explicatory|number=49 |year=1991|pages= 222–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story can also be seen from a feminist perspective, where the white wife is unjustly made to suffer for having given birth to a partially black child.

&quot;Desiree's Baby&quot; was first published in an 1893 issue of ''Vogue'' magazine, alongside another of Kate Chopin's short stories, &quot;A Visit to Avoyelles&quot;, under the heading &quot;Character Studies: The Father of Desiree's Baby - The Lover of Mentine.&quot; &quot;A Visit to Avoyelles&quot; typifies the local color writing that Chopin was known for, and is one of her stories that shows a couple in a completely fulfilled marriage. While Doudouce is hoping otherwise, he sees ample evidence that Mentine and Jules' marriage is a happy and fulfilling one, despite the poverty-stricken circumstances that they live in. In contrast, in &quot;Desiree's Baby&quot;, which is much more controversial, due to the topic of miscegenation, portrays a marriage in trouble. The other contrasts to &quot;A Visit to Avoyelles&quot; are very clear, although some are more subtle than others. Unlike Mentine and Jules, Armand and Desiree are rich and own slaves and a plantation. Mentine and Jules' marriage has weathered many hard times, while Armand and Desiree's falls apart at the first sign of trouble. Kate Chopin was very talented at showing various sides of marriages and local people and their lives, making her writing very broad and sweeping in topic, even as she had many common themes in her work.&lt;ref&gt;Gibert, Teresa &quot;Textual, Contextual and Critical Surprises in 'Desiree's Baby'&quot; ''Connotations: A Journal for Critical Debate''. vol. 14.1-3. 2004/2005. pg. 38-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chopin, Kate &quot;A Visit to Avoyelles&quot; ''Bayou Folk'' 1893 pg. 223-229&lt;/ref&gt;

Martha Cutter argues that Kate Chopin demonstrates feminine resistance to patriarchal society through her short stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;:222&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutter|first=Martha|title=Losing the Battle but Winning the War: Resistance to Patriarchal Discourse in Kate Chopin's Short Fiction|url=http://go.galegroup.com.eznvcc.vccs.edu:2048/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CH1420056300&amp;docType=Critical+essay&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=LitRC&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CH1420056300&amp;searchId=R5&amp;userGroupName=viva23470&amp;inPS=true|journal=Legacy: A Journal of American Women Writers|volume=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutter claims that Chopin's resistance can be traced through the timeline of her work, with Chopin becoming more and more understanding of how women can fight back suppression as time progresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:222&quot;/&gt; To demonstrate this, Cutter claims that Chopin's earlier stories, such as &quot;At the 'Cadian Ball,&quot; &quot;Wiser than a God,&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Mobry's Reason&quot; present women who are outright resisting, and are therefore not taken seriously, erased, or called insane. However, in Chopin's later stories, the female characters take on a different voice of resistance, one that is more &quot;covert&quot; and works to undermine patriarchal discourse from within. Cutter exemplifies this idea through the presentation of Chopin's works written after 1894.&lt;ref name=&quot;:222&quot;/&gt; Cutter claims that Chopin wanted to &quot;disrupt patriarchal discourse, without being censored by it.&quot; And to do this, Chopin tried different strategies in her writings: silent women, overly resistant women, women with a &quot;voice covert,&quot; and women who mimic patriarchal discourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;:222&quot;/&gt;

In 1893, she wrote &quot;Madame Célestin's Divorce,&quot; and thirteen of her stories were published. In 1894, &quot;[[The Story of an Hour]]&quot; and &quot;A Respectable woman&quot; were firstly published by ''Vogue''. ''Bayou Folk'', a collection of twenty-three of Chopin's stories, was a success to Kate Chopin in 1894 which was published by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]]. It was the first of her works to gain national attention, and was followed by another collection of short stories, ''A Night in Acadie'' (1897).

=== ''The Awakening'' ===
{{Main|The Awakening (Chopin novel)}}
Published in 1899, her novel ''The Awakening'' is often considered ahead of its time, garnering more negative reviews than positive from contemporary sources. Chopin was discouraged by this criticism, and would turn to writing short stories almost exclusively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.eznvcc.vccs.edu:2048/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;docId=GALE%7CH1420000416&amp;docType=Work+overview%2C+Critical+essay&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=LitRC&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CH1420000416&amp;searchId=R1&amp;userGroupName=viva23470&amp;inPS=true|title=An overview of The Awakening|last=Susan|first=Green|website=Literature Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female characters in ''The Awakening'' went beyond the standards of social norms of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bender|first=Bert|date=September 1991|title=The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and The Descent of Man|journal=American Literature|volume=63|issue=3|pages=459–473|doi=10.2307/2927243|jstor=2927243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mou|first=Xianfeng|title=Kate Chopin's Narrative Techniques and Separate Space in The Awakening|journal=The Southern Literary Journal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist has sexual desires and questions the sanctity of motherhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; 
The novel explores the theme of marital infidelity from the perspective of a wife. The book was widely banned, and fell out of print for several decades before being republished in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; It is now considered a classic of feminist fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Chopin reacted to the negative events happening to her by commenting ironically:&lt;blockquote&gt;I never dreamt of Mrs. Pontellier making such a mess of things and working out her own damnation as she did. If I had had the slightest intimation of such a thing I would have excluded her from the company. But when I found out what she was up to, the play was half over and it was then too late.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Bender, Chopin was intrigued by Darwin's ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Though she agreed with the processes of evolution, Chopin however quarreled with Darwin's theory of sexual selection and the female's role, which can be exemplified in ''The Awakening'', in which Bender argues that Chopin references ''The Descent of Man''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; In his essay, Darwin suggests female inferiority and says that males had &quot;gained the power of selection.&quot; Bender argues that in her writing, Chopin presented women characters that had selective power based on their own sexual desires, not the want of reproduction or love.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Bender argues this through the examples of Edna Pontellier in ''The Awakening,'' Mrs. Baroda in &quot;A Respectable Woman,&quot; and Mrs. Mallard in &quot;The Story of an Hour.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Martha Cutter's article, &quot;The Search for A Feminine Voice in the Works of Kate Chopin,&quot; analyzes the female characters in many of Chopin's stories. Cutter argues that Chopin's opinion of women as being &quot;the invisible and unheard sex&quot; is exemplified through the characterization of Edna in the ''Awakening''. Cutter argues that Chopin's writing was shocking due to its sexual identity and articulation of feminine desire. According to Cutter, Chopin's stories disrupt patriarchal norms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt; Today, The Awakening is said to be one of the five top favourite novels in literature courses all over America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=America Literature|publisher=McDougal Littell|year=2008|isbn=0-618-56866-2|location=United States of America|pages=758}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Reception and legacy ==

=== Legacy ===
Kate Chopin has been credited by some as a pioneer of the early feminist movement even though she did not achieve any literary rewards for her works.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutter|first=Martha|title=The Search for a Feminine Voice in the Works of Kate Chopin|journal=Unruly Tongue: Identity and Voice in American Women's Writing|volume=127|pages=87–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:222&quot;/&gt;

=== Critical reception ===
Kate Chopin wrote the majority of her short stories and novels between the years 1889 - 1904. Altogether, Chopin wrote about a hundred short stories or novels during her time as a fiction writer; her short stories were published in a number of local newspapers including the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Citation|chapter=XII. THE AWAKENING|date=January 31, 1932|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9781512805659|doi=10.9783/9781512805659-015|title=Kate Chopin and Her Creole Stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of her short stories were also published in national Magazines like ''[[The Youth's Companion|Youth's Companion]]'' and ''[[Harper's Young People]]''. ''Bayou Folk'' was especially well reviewed, with Chopin even writing about how she had seen a hundred press notices about it. Those stories were published in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic]]''. People particularly liked how she used local dialects to give her characters a more authentic and relatable feel.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; She also published two novels, ''At Fault'' and ''The Awakening''. Her novels were not well received initially, compared to her short stories. Her 1899 novel ''The Awakening'' was considered to be immoral due to the overt themes of female sexuality, as well as the female protagonist constantly rebuking societal gender roles and norms. There have been rumors that the novel was originally banned, which have since been disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Carol Farley|last2=Toth|first2=Emily|date=December 1991|title=Kate Chopin: A Life of the Author of The Awakening.|journal=American Literature|volume=63|issue=4|pages=755|doi=10.2307/2926892|issn=0002-9831|jstor=2926892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local and national newspapers published mixed reviews of Chopin's novel with one calling it &quot;poison&quot; and &quot;unpleasant&quot;, going on to say it was &quot;too strong a drink for moral babes&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Research guide to American literature.|author=Franklin, Benjamin|date=2010|publisher=Facts On File|isbn=9780816078615|oclc=699681835|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/researchguidetoa0000unse}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another newspaper published a review calling the novel, &quot;A St. Louis Woman Who Has Turned Fame Into Literature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toth|first=Emily|date=July 1999|title=Emily Toth Thanks Kate Chopin|journal=The Women's Review of Books|volume=16|issue=10/11|pages=34|doi=10.2307/4023250|issn=0738-1433|jstor=4023250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of the early reviews for ''The Awakening'' were largely negative. [[Emily Toth]], one of Chopin's most well known biographers, thought she had gone too far with this novel. She argued that the protagonist, Edna, and her blatant sensuality was too much for the male gatekeepers. So much so that publication of her next novel was even cancelled.

It wasn't until [[Per Seyersted]], a Norwegian professor and scholar, rediscovered her almost 70 years later that the general public began to really appreciate her work as essential Feminist and Southern literature from the 19th Century. Seyersted wrote that she &quot;broke new ground in American Literature.&quot; According to Emily Toth, Kate Chopin's work rose in popularity and recognition during the 1970s due to themes of women venturing outside of the constraints set upon them by society, which appealed to people participating in feminist activism and the sexual revolution. She also argues that the works appealed to women in the 1960s, &quot;a time when American women yearned to know about our feisty foremothers&quot;.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt; Academics and scholars began to put Chopin in the same feminist categories as [[Louisa May Alcott]], [[Susan Warner]], and [[Emily Dickinson]]. Parallels between Alcott and Chopin have been drawn to point out how both authors wrote about females who departed from their traditional roles by dreaming of or striving for independence and individual freedoms, also described as a dramatization of a woman's struggle for selfhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winn|first=Harbour|date=1992|title=Echoes of Literary Sisterhood: Louisa May Alcott and Kate Chopin|journal=Studies in American Fiction|volume=20|issue=2|pages=205–208|doi=10.1353/saf.1992.0000|issn=2158-415X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for ''[[Choice Reviews]]'' stated that it was ultimately a struggle doomed to failure because the patriarchal conventions of her society restricted her freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 1, 1994|title=The awakening: a novel of beginnings|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=31|issue=7|pages=31–3638–31–3638|doi=10.5860/choice.31-3638|issn=0009-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Simons felt that this failed struggle was perfectly captured by the ending of the novel, where Edna Pontellier ends her life due to her realization that she cannot truly be both the traditional mother role and have a sense of herself as an individual at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Karen (Spring 1998). &quot;Kate Chopin on the Nature of Things&quot; (PDF). ''The Mississippi Quarterly''. '''51.2''': p243.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation in other media ==
Louisiana [[Public Broadcasting]], under president [[Beth Courtney]], produced a documentary on Chopin's life, ''Kate Chopin: A Reawakening''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/katechopin/program.html|title=Kate Chopin: A Re-Awakening - About the Program|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the penultimate episode of the first season of HBO's ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]],'' set in New Orleans, the teacher Creighton (played by [[John Goodman]]) assigns Kate Chopin's ''The Awakening'' to his freshmen and warns them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want you to take your time with it,&quot; he cautions. &quot;Pay attention to the language itself. The ideas. Don't think in terms of a beginning and an end. Because unlike some plot-driven entertainments, there is no closure in real life. Not really.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/06/treme-as-a-season-ends-so-does-a-life/58120/ &quot;Treme - as a season ends, so does a life&quot;], ''The Atlantic,'' June 2010, accessed 25 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''journalist''' is a person who collects, writes, photographs, processes, edits or comments on [[news]] or other topical [[information]] to the public. A journalist's work is called [[journalism]].

==Roles==
A '''reporter''' is a type of journalist who [[research]]es, writes and reports on information in order to present using [[source (journalism)|sources]]. This may entail conducting [[interview]]s, information-gathering and/or writing articles. Reporters may split their time between working in a [[newsroom]], or from home, and going out to witness events or interviewing people. Reporters may be assigned a specific [[Beat reporting|beat]] or area of coverage.

Depending on context, the term ''journalist'' may include various types of [[editing|editors]], editorial-writers, [[columnist]]s, and visual journalists, such as [[photojournalist]]s (journalists who use the medium of [[photography]]).

Matthew C. Nisbet, who has written on [[science communication]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back+Issues/March-April+2009/Nisbet-full.html |magazine=[[Environment Magazine]] |title=Communicating Climate Change: Why Frames Matter for Public Engagement |first=Matthew C. |last=Nisbet |publisher=[[Heldref Publications]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703075520/http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back+Issues/March-April+2009/Nisbet-full.html |archive-date=3 July 2018 |agency=[[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]] |access-date=9 March 2019 |date=March–April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; has defined a &quot;knowledge journalist&quot; as a [[public intellectual]] who, like [[Walter Lippmann]], [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]], [[Fareed Zakaria]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Michael Pollan]], [[Thomas Friedman]], and [[Andrew Revkin]], sees their role as researching complicated issues of fact or science which most laymen would not have the time or access to [[information]] to research themselves, then communicating an accurate and understandable version to the public as a teacher and policy advisor.&lt;blockquote&gt;In his best-known books, ''Public Opinion'' (1922) and ''The Phantom Public'' (1925), Lippmann argued that most individuals lacked the capacity, time, and motivation to follow and analyze news of the many complex policy questions that troubled society. Nor did they often directly experience most social problems, or have direct access to expert insights. These limitations were made worse by a news media that tended to over-simplify issues and to reinforce [[stereotypes]], partisan viewpoints, and [[prejudices]]. As a consequence, Lippmann believed that the public needed journalists like himself who could serve as expert analysts, guiding “citizens to a deeper understanding of what was really important”. &lt;ref name=&quot;Knowledge journalist&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Nature’s Prophet: Bill McKibben as Journalist, Public Intellectual and Activist |url=http://shorensteincenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/D-78-Nisbet1.pdf |work=Discussion Paper Series #D-78 |publisher=[[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]], School of Communication and the Center for Social Media [[American University]] |access-date=March 8, 2013 |first=Matthew C. |last=Nisbet |page=7 |date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2018, the [[United States Department of Labor|United States Department of Labor's]] Occupational Outlook Handbook reported that employment for the category, &quot;reporters, correspondents and broadcast news analysts,&quot; will decline 9 percent between 2016 and 2026.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Talton |first=Jon |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/occupational-outlook-where-the-big-bucks-are-and-arent/ |title=Occupational outlook: Where the big bucks are — and aren’t |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=31 January 2018 |access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalistic freedom==
Journalists sometimes expose themselves to danger, particularly when reporting in areas of [[armed conflict]] or in states that do not respect the [[freedom of the press]]. [[Organizations]] such as the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] and [[Reporters Without Borders]] publish reports on press freedom and advocate for journalistic freedom. As of November 2011, the Committee to Protect Journalists reports that 887 journalists have been killed worldwide since 1992 by [[murder]] (71%), [[crossfire]] or [[combat]] (17%), or on dangerous assignment (11%). The &quot;ten deadliest countries&quot; for journalists since 1992 have been [[Iraq]] (230 deaths), [[Philippines]] (109), [[Russia]] (77), [[Colombia]] (76), [[Mexico]] (69), [[Algeria]] (61), [[Pakistan]] (59), [[India]] (49), [[Somalia]] (45), [[Brazil]] (31) and [[Sri Lanka]] (30).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/killed/ |title=1337 Journalists Killed |work=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |access-date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee to Protect Journalists also reports that as of December 1, 2010, 145 journalists were jailed worldwide for journalistic activities. Current numbers are even higher. The ten countries with the largest number of currently-imprisoned journalists are [[Turkey]] (95),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Number of Jailed Journalists Nearly Doubles in Turkey |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/04/jailed-journalists-nearly-double-in-turkey.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=5 April 2012 |access-date=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[People's Republic of China|China]] (34), [[Iran]] (34), [[Eritrea]] (17), [[Burma]] (13), [[Uzbekistan]] (6), [[Vietnam]] (5), [[Cuba]] (4), [[Ethiopia]] (4), and [[Sudan]] (3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iran, China drive prison tally to 14-year high |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2010/12/cpj-journalist-prison-census-iran-china-highest-14-years.php |date=December 8, 2010 |work=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |access-date=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from physical harm, journalists are harmed psychologically. This applies especially to war reporters, but their editorial offices at home often do not know how to deal appropriately with the reporters they expose to danger. Hence, a systematic and sustainable way of psychological support for traumatized journalists is strongly needed. However, only little and fragmented support programs exist so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/petra-tabeling-crisis-areas-journalists-are-risk-physical-and-psychological-terms |title=Petra Tabeling: In crisis areas, journalists are at risk in physical and psychological terms. |work=D + C |first=Petra |last=Tabeling |date=24 December 2014 |access-date=9 March 2019 |issue=1.2015 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journalist and source relationship ==
The relationship between a professional journalist and a source can be rather complex, and a source can sometimes have an effect on an article written by the journalist. The article 'A Compromised Fourth Estate' uses Herbert Gans' metaphor to capture their relationship. He uses a dance metaphor, &quot;The Tango,&quot; to illustrate the co-operative nature of their interactions inasmuch as &quot;It takes two to tango&quot;. Herbert suggests that the source often leads, but journalists commonly object to this notion for two reasons:
# It signals source supremacy in news making.
# It offends journalists’ professional culture, which emphasizes independence and editorial autonomy.

The dance metaphor goes on to state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A relationship with sources that is ''too cozy'' is potentially compromising of journalists’ integrity and risks becoming collusive. Journalists have typically favored a more robust, conflict model, based on a crucial assumption that if the media are to function as watchdogs of powerful economic and political interests, journalists must establish their independence of sources or risk the fourth estate being driven by the fifth estate of public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Justin|last2=Williams|first2=Andrew|last3=Franklin|first3=Bob|title=A Compromised Fourth Estate|journal=Journalism Studies|date=6 February 2008|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/14616700701767974|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The worst year on record for journalists ==

According to [[Reporters Without Borders]]' annual report, 2018 was the worst year on record for deadly violence and abuse toward journalists; there was a 15 per cent increase in such killings since 2017, with 80 killed, 348 imprisoned and 60 held hostage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Langford |first=Eleanor |title=2018 was worst year for violence and abuse against journalists, report says |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/12/17/2018-worst-year-violence-abuse-against-journalists-report-says/ |access-date=7 January 2019 |newspaper=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |date=17 December 2018 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WORLDWIDE ROUND-UP of journalists killed, detained, held hostage, or missing in 2018 |url=https://rsf.org/sites/default/files/worldwilde_round-up.pdf |access-date=7 January 2019 |work=[[Reporters Without Borders]] |date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victims included five members of [[George &quot;Bugs&quot; Moran]]'s [[North Side Gang]]. Moran's second in command and brother-in-law [[Albert Kachellek]] (''alias'' James Clark) was killed along with [[Adam Heyer]], the gang's bookkeeper and business manager, [[Albert Weinshank]], who managed several cleaning and dyeing operations for Moran, and gang enforcers [[Frank Gusenberg]] and [[Peter Gusenberg]]. Two collaborators were also shot: [[Reinhardt H. Schwimmer]], a former optician turned gambler and gang associate, and [[John May (gangster)|John May]], an occasional mechanic for the Moran gang. Real Chicago police officers arrived at the scene to find that victim [[Frank Gusenberg]] was still alive. He was taken to the hospital, where doctors stabilized him for a short time and police tried to question him. He had sustained 14 bullet wounds; the police asked him who did it, and he replied, &quot;No one shot me.&quot; He died three hours later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyle&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Valentine's Day Massacre| publisher=Salem Press Encyclopedia| last=Boyle| first=William| year=2015| url=http://0-search.ebscohost.com.dunnlib.simpson.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ers&amp;AN=89316685&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al Capone]] was widely assumed to have been responsible for ordering the murders in an attempt to eliminate Moran. Moran was the last survivor of the North Side gunmen; his succession had come about because his similarly aggressive predecessors [[Vincent Drucci]] and [[Hymie Weiss]] had been killed in the violence that followed the murder of original leader [[Dean O'Banion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bugsmoran.net/northsiders/drucci.html Bugs Moran Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903184250/http://www.bugsmoran.net/northsiders/drucci.html |date=2015-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id111.htm ''My Al Capone Museum''] [http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id111.htm &quot;Vincent 'The Schemer' Drucci&quot;], Mario Gomes, accessed 2/7/14&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors contributed to the timing of the plan to kill Moran. Earlier in the year, North Sider Frank Gusenberg and his brother Peter unsuccessfully attempted to murder [[Jack McGurn]]. The North Side Gang was complicit in the murders of [[Pasqualino Lolordo|Pasqualino &quot;Patsy&quot; Lolordo]] and [[Antonio Lombardo|Antonio &quot;The Scourge&quot; Lombardo]]. Both had been presidents of the [[Unione Siciliana]], the local [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]], and close associates of Capone. Moran and Capone had been vying for control of the lucrative Chicago bootlegging trade. Moran had also been muscling in on a Capone-run [[dog track]] in the Chicago suburbs, and he had taken over several [[Bar|saloons]] that were run by Capone, insisting that they were in his territory.

The plan was to lure Moran to the SMC Cartage warehouse on North Clark Street on February 14, 1929 to kill him and perhaps two or three of his lieutenants. It is usually assumed that the North Siders were lured to the garage with the promise of a stolen, cut-rate shipment of whiskey, supplied by Detroit's [[The Purple Gang|Purple Gang]] which was associated with Capone. The Gusenberg brothers were supposed to drive two empty trucks to [[Detroit]] that day to pick up two loads of stolen Canadian whiskey. All of the victims were dressed in their best clothes, with the exception of John May, as was customary for the North Siders and other gangsters at the time.

Most of the Moran gang arrived at the warehouse by approximately 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., but Moran was not there, having left his Parkway Hotel apartment late. He and fellow gang member [[Ted Newberry]] approached the rear of the warehouse from a side street when they saw a police car approaching the building. They immediately turned and retraced their steps, going to a nearby coffee shop. They encountered gang member Henry Gusenberg on the street and warned him, so he too turned back. North Side Gang member [[Willie Marks]] also spotted the police car on his way to the garage, and he ducked into a doorway and jotted down the license number before leaving the neighborhood.

Capone's lookouts likely mistook one of Moran's men for Moran himself, probably Albert Weinshank, who was the same height and build. The physical similarity between the two men was enhanced by their dress that morning; both happened to be wearing the same color overcoats and hats. Witnesses outside the garage saw a Cadillac sedan pull up to a stop in front of the garage. Four men emerged and walked inside, two of them dressed in police uniform. The two fake police officers carried shotguns and entered the rear portion of the garage, where they found members of Moran's gang and collaborators Reinhart Schwimmer and John May, who was fixing one of the trucks. The fake policemen then ordered the men to line up against the wall. They then signaled to the pair in civilian clothes who had accompanied them. Two of the killers opened fire with [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson sub-machine guns]], one with a 20-round box magazine and the other a 50-round drum. They were thorough, spraying their victims left and right, even continuing to fire after all seven had hit the floor.  Two shotgun blasts afterward all but obliterated the faces of John May and James Clark, according to the coroner's report.

To give the appearance that everything was under control, the men in street clothes came out with their hands up, prodded by the two uniformed policemen. Inside the garage, the only survivors in the warehouse were May's dog &quot;Highball&quot; and Frank Gusenberg — despite 14 bullet wounds. He was still conscious, but he died three hours later, refusing to utter a word about the identities of the killers. The Valentine's Day Massacre set off a public outcry which posed a problem for all mob bosses.&lt;ref&gt;Reppetto, Thomas A. &quot;The &quot;Get Capone&quot; Drive: Print the Legend.&quot; American Mafia: A History of Its Rise to Power.

=== Victims ===
* [[Peter Gusenberg]], a front-line enforcer for the Moran organizations
* [[Frank Gusenberg]], the brother of Peter Gusenberg and also an enforcer
* [[Albert Kachellek]] (alias &quot;James Clark&quot;), Moran's second in command
* Adam Heyer, the bookkeeper and business manager of the Moran gang
* Reinhardt Schwimmer, an optician who had abandoned his practice to gamble on horse racing and associate with the gang
* Albert Weinshank, who managed several cleaning and dyeing operations for Moran; his resemblance to Moran is allegedly what set the massacre in motion before Moran arrived, including the clothes that he was wearing
* John May, an occasional car mechanic for the Moran gang&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Organized Crime in Miami| publisher=Southern Illinois University Press| last=Bash| first=Avi| year=2016| isbn=9781439658840| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8OpDQAAQBAJ&amp;q=seven+dead+john+may+schwimmer+valentine%27s+day+massacre&amp;pg=PT34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
Within days, Capone received a [[summons]] to testify before a Chicago [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] on charges of federal Prohibition violations, but he claimed to be too unwell to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Capone: The Man and the Era, by Laurence Bergreen, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

It was common knowledge that Moran was hijacking Capone's Detroit-based liquor shipments, and police focused their attention on Detroit's predominantly Jewish [[The Purple Gang|Purple Gang]]. Landladies Mrs. Doody and Mrs. Orvidson had taken in three men as roomers ten days before the massacre, and their rooming houses were directly across the street from the North Clark Street garage. They picked out mugshots of Purple Gang members [[George Lewis (gang member)|George Lewis]], [[Eddie Fletcher]], [[Phil Keywell]], and his younger brother [[Harry Keywell|Harry]], but they later wavered in their identification. The police questioned and cleared Fletcher, Lewis, and Harry Keywell. Nevertheless, the Keywell brothers (and by extension the Purple Gang) remained associated with the crime in the years that followed. Many also believed that the police were involved, which may have been the intention of the killers.

On February 22, police were called to the scene of a garage fire on Wood Street where they found a 1927 Cadillac sedan disassembled and partially burned, and they determined that the killers had used the car. They traced the engine number to a Michigan Avenue dealer who had sold the car to a James Morton of Los Angeles. The garage had been rented by a man calling himself Frank Rogers, who gave his address as 1859 West North Avenue. This was the address of the [[Circus Café]] operated by [[Claude Maddox]], a former [[St. Louis]] gangster with ties to the Capone gang, the Purple Gang, and the St. Louis gang, Egan's Rats. Police could not turn up any information about persons named James Morton or Frank Rogers, but they had a definite lead on one of the killers. Just minutes before the killings, a truck driver named [[Elmer Lewis]] had turned a corner a block away from 2122 North Clark and sideswiped a police car. He told police that he stopped immediately but was waved away by the uniformed driver, who was missing a front tooth. [[Board of Education]] president [[H. Wallace Caldwell]] had witnessed the accident, and he gave the same description of the driver. Police were confident that they were describing [[Fred Burke]], a former member of Egan's Rats. Burke and a close companion named [[James Ray (mobster)|James Ray]] were known to wear police uniforms whenever on a robbery spree. Burke was also a fugitive, under indictment for robbery and murder in [[Ohio]]. Police also suggested that Joseph Lolordo could have been one of the killers because of his brother Pasqualino's recent murder by the North Side Gang.

Police then announced that they suspected Capone gunmen [[John Scalise]] and [[Albert Anselmi]], as well as Jack McGurn and [[Frank Rio]], a Capone bodyguard. Police eventually charged McGurn and Scalise with the massacre. Capone murdered John Scalise, Anselmi, and [[Joseph &quot;Hop Toad&quot; Giunta]] in May 1929 after he learned about their plan to kill him. The police dropped the murder charges against Jack McGurn because of a lack of evidence, and he was just charged with a violation of the [[Mann Act]]; he took his girlfriend Louise Rolfe across state lines to marry.&lt;!---hiding this sentence because it makes no sense:  Rolfe was the main witness against him, making her known as the &quot;Blonde Alibi.&quot;---&gt;

The case stagnated until December 14, 1929, when the [[Berrien County, Michigan|Berrien County]], [[Michigan]] Sheriff's Department raided the [[St. Joseph]], Michigan bungalow of &quot;[[Frederick Dane]]&quot;, the registered owner of a vehicle driven by [[Fred &quot;Killer&quot; Burke]]. Burke had been drinking that night, then rear-ended another vehicle and drove off. Patrolman [[Charles Skelly]] pursued, finally forcing him off the road. Skelly hopped onto the running board of Burke's car, but he was shot three times and died of his wounds that night. The car was found wrecked and abandoned just outside St. Joseph and traced to Fred Dane. By this time, police photos confirmed that Dane was in fact Fred Burke, wanted by the Chicago police for his participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.

Police raided Burke's bungalow and found a large trunk containing a bullet-proof vest, almost $320,000 in bonds recently stolen from a [[Wisconsin]] bank, two Thompson submachine guns, pistols, two shotguns, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. St. Joseph authorities immediately notified the Chicago police, who requested both machine guns. They used the new science of [[forensic ballistics]] to identify both weapons as those used in the massacre. They also discovered that one of them had also been used to murder [[New York City|New York]] [[mobster]] [[Frankie Yale]] a year and a half earlier. Unfortunately, no further concrete evidence surfaced in the massacre case. Burke was captured over a year later on a [[Missouri]] farm. The case against him was strongest in connection to the murder of Officer Skelly, so he was tried in Michigan and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 1940.

== Bolton revelations ==

On January 8, 1935, FBI agents surrounded a Chicago apartment building at 3920 North Pine Grove looking for the remaining members of the [[Barker–Karpis gang|Barker Gang]]. A brief shootout erupted, resulting in the death of bank robber [[Russell Gibson]]. Taken into custody were [[Arthur Barker|Doc Barker]], [[Byron Bolton]], and two women. Bolton was a Navy machine-gunner and associate of Egan's Rats, and he had been the valet of Chicago hit man [[Fred Goetz]]. Bolton was privy to many of the Barker Gang's crimes and pinpointed the Florida hideout of [[Ma Barker]] and [[Freddie Barker]], both of whom were killed in a shootout with the FBI a week later. Bolton claimed to have taken part in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre with Goetz, Fred Burke, and several others.

The FBI had no jurisdiction in a state murder case, so they kept Bolton's revelations confidential until the ''[[Chicago American]]'' newspaper reported a second-hand version of his confession. The newspaper declared that the crime had been &quot;solved&quot;, despite being stonewalled by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and the FBI, who did not want any part of the massacre case. Garbled versions of Bolton's story went out in the national media. Bolton, it was reported,{{where|date=February 2019}} claimed that the murder of Bugs Moran had been plotted in October or November 1928 at a [[Couderay, Wisconsin]] resort owned by Fred Goetz. Present at this meeting were Goetz, Al Capone, [[Frank Nitti]], Fred Burke, [[Gus Winkler]], [[Louis Campagna]], Daniel Serritella, William Pacelli, and Bolton. The men stayed two or three weeks, hunting and fishing when they were not planning the murder of their enemies.

Bolton claimed that he and Jimmy Moran were charged with watching the S.M.C. Cartage garage and phoning the signal to the killers at the Circus Café when Bugs Moran arrived at the meeting. Police had found a letter addressed to Bolton in the lookout nest (and possibly a vial of prescription medicine). Bolton guessed that the actual killers had been Burke, Winkeler, Goetz, [[Robert Carey (gangster)|Bob Carey]], Raymond &quot;Crane Neck&quot; Nugent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8633614| title=Raymond Nugent| publisher=Find A grave| date=April 13, 2004| accessdate=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claude Maddox]] (four shooters and two getaway drivers). Bolton gave an account of the massacre different from the one generally told by historians. He claimed that he saw only &quot;plainclothes&quot; men exit the Cadillac and go into the garage. This indicates that a second car was used by the killers. [[George Brichet]] claimed to have seen at least two uniformed men exiting a car in the alley and entering the garage through its rear doors. A [[Peerless Motor Company]] sedan had been found near a Maywood house owned by Claude Maddox in the days after the massacre, and in one of the pockets was an address book belonging to victim Albert Weinshank. Bolton said that he had mistaken one of Moran's men to be Moran, after which he telephoned the signal to the Circus Café. The killers had expected to kill Moran and two or three of his men, but they were unexpectedly confronted with seven men; they simply decided to kill them all and get out fast. Bolton claimed that Capone was furious with him for his mistake and the resulting police pressure and threatened to kill him, only to be dissuaded by Fred Goetz.

His claims were corroborated by Gus Winkeler's widow Georgette in an official FBI statement and in her memoirs, which were published in a four-part series in a true detective magazine during the winter of 1935–36. She revealed that her husband and his friends had formed a special crew used by Capone for high-risk jobs. The mob boss was said to have trusted them implicitly and nicknamed them the &quot;American Boys&quot;. Bolton's statements were also backed up by William Drury, a Chicago detective who had stayed on the massacre case long after everyone else had given up. Bank robber [[Alvin Karpis]] later claimed to have heard secondhand from Ray Nugent about the massacre and that the &quot;American Boys&quot; were paid a collective salary of $2,000 a week plus bonuses. Karpis also claimed that Capone had told him while they were in [[Alcatraz]] together that Goetz had been the actual planner of the massacre.

Despite Byron Bolton's statements, no action was taken by the FBI. All the men whom he named were dead by 1935, with the exception of Burke and Maddox. Bank robber [[Harvey Bailey]] complained in his 1973 autobiography that he and Fred Burke had been drinking beer in [[Calumet City]], [[Illinois]] at the time of the massacre, and the resulting heat forced them to abandon their bank robbing ventures. Historians are still divided on whether or not the &quot;American Boys&quot; committed the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.

== Other suspects ==
Many mobsters have been named as part of the Valentine's Day hit team. Two prime suspects are [[Cosa Nostra]] hit men [[John Scalise]] and [[Albert Anselmi]]. In the days after the massacre, Scalise was heard{{by whom|date=February 2019}} to brag, &quot;I am the most powerful man in Chicago.&quot; [[Unione Siciliana]] president Joseph Guinta had recently elevated him to the position of the Unione's vice-president. Nevertheless, Scalise, Anselmi, and Guinta were found dead on a lonely road near [[Hammond, Indiana|Hammond]], [[Indiana]] on May 8, 1929. Gangland lore has it that Capone had discovered that the pair were planning to betray him. Legend states{{where|date=February 2019}} that Capone produced a baseball bat at the climax of a dinner party thrown in their honor and beat the trio to death.&lt;ref name= Hoffman,Dennis&gt;{{cite book| title=Scarface Al and the Crime Crusaders: Chicago's Private War Against Capone| publisher=Southern Illinois University Press| last=Hoffman| first=Dennis Earl| year=2010| pages=71–89| url=http://0-search.ebscohost.com.dunnlib.simpson.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=e000xna&amp;AN=367961&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;ebv=EB&amp;ppid=pp_Cover_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder weapons ==

Police tested the two [[Thompson submachine gun]]s (serial numbers 2347 and 7580) found in [[Fred Burke]]'s Michigan bungalow and determined that both had been used in the massacre. One of them had also been used in the murder of Brooklyn mob boss [[Frankie Yale]], which confirmed the [[New York Police Department|New York Police Department's]] long-held theory that Burke had been responsible for Yale's death.

Les Farmer, a deputy sheriff in [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]], Illinois, purchased gun number 2347 on November 12, 1924. Marion and the surrounding area were overrun by the warring bootleg factions of the [[Shelton Brothers Gang]] and [[Charlie Birger]]. Farmer had ties with Egan's Rats, based 100 miles away in St. Louis, and the weapon had wound up in Fred Burke's possession by 1927. It is possible that he used this same gun in Detroit's [[Milaflores Massacre]] on March 28, 1927. Chicago sporting goods owner [[Peter von Frantzius]] sold gun number 7580 to a [[Victor Thompson]], also known as Frank V. Thompson, but it wound up with [[James &quot;Bozo&quot; Shupe]], a small-time [[Hoodlum|hood]] from Chicago's West Side who had ties to various members of Capone's outfit. Both guns are still in the possession of the Berrien County, Michigan Sheriff's Department.

'''Ayodhya''' ({{IPA-hns|əˈjoːdʱːjaː|lang|Ayodhya.ogg}}; [[IAST]]: ''{{transl|hns|IAST|Ayodhyā}}'') is a city and the administrative headquarters of [[Faizabad district]] (officially Ayodhya district) of [[Uttar Pradesh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ayodhya.nic.in/about-district/|title=About District {{!}} District Ayodhya – Government of Uttar Pradesh|website=District Ayodhya – Government of Uttar Pradesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares a municipal corporation with its neighbouring twin town of [[Faizabad]].

The city is identified by some with the [[Ayodhya (legendary city)|legendary city of Ayodhya]], and as such, as being the birthplace of Lord [[Rama]] and setting of the epic ''[[Ramayana]]''. The accuracy of this identification is central to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]: modern scholars variously believe that the present-day Ayodhya is same as the legendary Ayodhya, or that the legendary city is a mythical place that came to be identified with the present-day Ayodhya only during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] around the 4th–5th century AD.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The present-day city is identified as the location of Saketa, which was an important city of the [[Kosala]] [[mahajanapada]] in the first millennium BC, and later served as its capital.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} The early Buddhist and Jain canonical texts mention that the religious leaders [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Mahavira]] visited and lived in the city. The Jain texts also describe it as the birthplace of five [[tirthankara]]s namely, [[Rishabhanatha]], [[Ajitanatha]], [[Abhinandananatha]], [[Sumatinath]] and [[Anantnath]], and associate it with the legendary [[chakravarti (Sanskrit term)#Jain tradition|chakravartins]]. From the Gupta period onwards, several sources mention Ayodhya and Saketa as the name of the same city.

Owing to the belief as the birthplace of Rama, Ayodhya (Awadh) has been regarded as one of the seven most important pilgrimage sites ([[Sapta Puri|Saptapuri]]) for Hindus. It is believed that the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|birth spot of Rama]] was marked by a temple, which is said to have been demolished by the orders of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Babur]] and a disputed mosque erected in its place. In 1992, it lead to the [[demolition of the Babri Masjid|demolition]] of Babri mosque by Hindu mobs with the aim to replace it with a temple of Rama. The Ayodhya dispute concerned activism by Hindu groups to rebuild a grand temple of Rama at the site of Janmabhoomi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/ayodhya-verdict-live-updates-sc-ruling-in-ram-mandir-babri-masjid-ayodhya-land-dispute-case-today-hindus-muslim-119110900133_1.html|title=Ayodhya verdict: No place for fear, negativity in 'New India', says PM|last=Team|first=BS Web|website=www.business-standard.com|language=en|access-date=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five judges of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] bench heard the title dispute cases from August to October 2019. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court, headed by [[Chief Justice of India|Chief Justice]] [[Ranjan Gogoi]], vacated the previous decision and ruled that the land belonged to the government per tax records. It further ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give an alternative {{convert|5|acre|ha}} of land to the [[Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board]] to build a mosque to replace the demolished [[Babri Masjid]]. The construction of [[Ram Mandir, Ayodhya|Ram Mandir]] commenced in August 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ayodhya Ram Mandir highlights: Celebration, lamps, fireworks light up the nation as it witnesses a historic day |url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ayodhya-ram-mandir-bhoomi-pujan-live-updates-muhurat-photos-narendra-modi-yogi-adityanath-babri-masjid-ram-mandir-kar-sevak-hindu-temple-ram-janmabhoomi-photo-869583.html |access-date=15 August 2020 |work=Deccan Herald |date=5 August 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and names ==
The word &quot;Ayodhya&quot; is a regularly formed derivation of the [[Sanskrit]] verb ''yudh'', &quot;to fight, to wage war&quot;.  ''Yodhya'' is the future passive participle, meaning &quot;to be fought&quot;; the initial ''a'' is the negative prefix; the whole, therefore, means &quot;not to be fought&quot; or, more idiomatically in English, &quot;invincible&quot;.{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=2}} This meaning is attested by the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', which uses it to refer to the unconquerable city of gods.{{sfn|Bakker, The rise of Ayodhya as a place of pilgrimage|1982|p=103}} The 9th century [[Jain]] poem ''[[Adi Purana]]'' also states that Ayodhya &quot;does not exist by name alone but by the merit&quot; of being unconquerable by enemies. ''Satyopakhyana'' interprets the word slightly differently, stating that it means &quot;that which cannot be conquered by sins&quot; (instead of enemies).{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=4}}

&quot;Saketa&quot; is the older name for the city, attested in Sanskrit, Jain, Sanskrit, Buddhist, Greek and Chinese sources.{{sfn|Lutgendorf, Imagining Ayodhya|1997|p=22}} According to [[Vaman Shivram Apte]], the word &quot;Saketa&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit words ''Saha'' (with) and ''Aketen'' (houses or buildings). The ''Adi Purana'' states that Ayodhya is called Saketa &quot;because of its magnificent buildings which had significant banners as their arms&quot;. {{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=5}} According to [[Hans T. Bakker]], the word may be derived from the roots ''sa'' and ''ketu'' (&quot;with banner&quot;); the variant name ''saketu'' is attested in the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]''.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=12}}

The older name in English was &quot;Oudh&quot; or &quot;Oude&quot;, and the princely state it was the capital of until 1856 is still known as [[Oudh State]].

Ayodhya was stated to be the capital of the ancient [[Kosala]] kingdom in the ''[[Ramayana]]''. Hence it was also referred to as &quot;Kosala&quot;. The ''Adi Purana'' states that Ayodhya is famous as ''su-kośala'' &quot;because of its prosperity and good skill&quot;.{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=5}}

The cities of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] (Thailand), and [[Yogyakarta]] (Indonesia), are named after Ayodhya.

== History ==
[[File:Ayodhya Nagri.jpg|thumb|Gold carving depiction of the legendary Ayodhya at the [[Ajmer Jain temple]]]]

Ancient [[Hindu]] [[Sanskrit]]-language epics, such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' mention a [[Ayodhya (legendary city)|legendary city called Ayodhya]], which was the capital of the legendary [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvaku]] kings of Kosala, including Rama.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7}} Neither these texts, nor the earlier Sanskrit texts such as the [[Vedas]], mention a city called Saketa. Non-religious, non-legendary ancient Sanskrit texts, such as Panini's ''Ashtadhyayi'' and Patanjali's commentary on it, do mention Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7}} The later Buddhist text ''[[Mahavastu]]'' describes Saketa as the seat of the Ikshvaku king Sujata, whose descendants established the [[Shakya]] capital [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=5}}

The earliest of the Buddhist [[Pali canon|Pali-language texts]] and the Jain Prakrit-language texts mention a city called Saketa (Sageya or Saeya in Prakrit) as an important city of the [[Kosala]] [[mahajanapada]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=5–6}} Topographical indications in both Buddhist and Jain texts suggest that Saketa is the same as the present-day Ayodhya.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=2}} For example, according to the ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'' and the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]'', Saketa was located at a distance of six ''[[yojana]]''s from [[Shravasti]]. The ''Vinaya Pitaka'' mentions that a big river was located between the two cities, and the ''[[Sutta Nipata]]'' mentions Saketa as the first halting place on the southward road from Shravasti to [[Pratishthana]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=5}}

Fourth century onwards, multiple texts, including Kalidasa's ''[[Raghuvamsha]]'', mention Ayodhya as another name for Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=6–7}} The later Jain canonical text ''Jambudvipa-Pannati'' describes a city called Viniya (or Vinita) as the birthplace of [[Rishabha|Lord Rishabhanatha]], and associates this city with [[Bharata Chakravartin]]; the ''[[Kalpa Sutra|Kalpa-Sutra]]'' describes Ikkhagabhumi as the birthplace of Rishabhadev. The index on the Jain text ''Paumachariya'' clarifies that Aojjha (Aodhya), Kosala-puri (&quot;Kosala city&quot;), Viniya, and Saeya (Saketa) are synonyms. The post-Canonical Jain texts also mention &quot;Aojjha&quot;; for example, the ''Avassagacurni'' describes it as the principal city of Kosala, while the ''Avassaganijjutti'' names it as the capital of [[King Sagara|Sagara Chakravartin]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=6}} The ''Avassaganijjutti'' implies that Viniya (&quot;Vinia&quot;), Kosalapuri (&quot;Kosalapura&quot;), and Ikkhagabhumi were distinct cities, naming them as the capitals of Abhinamdana, Sumai, and Usabha respectively. Abhayadeva's commentary on the ''Thana Sutta'', another post-canonical text, identifies Saketa, Ayodhya, and Vinita as one city.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=6}}

According to one theory, the legendary Ayodhya city is the same as the historical city of Saketa and the present-day Ayodhya. According to another theory, the legendary Ayodhya is a mythical city,{{sfn|Arya|1990|p=44}} and the name &quot;Ayodhya&quot; came to be used for the Saketa (present-day Ayodhya) only around the fourth century, when a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] emperor (probably [[Skandagupta]]) moved his capital to Saketa, and renamed it to Ayodhya after the legendary city.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Bhagwan Singh Josh]], [[Bipan Chandra]], [[Harbans Mukhia]], [[K.

=== As Saketa ===

Archaeological and literary evidence suggests that the site of present-day Ayodhya had developed into an urban settlement by the 5th or 6th-century BC.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=2}} The site is identified as the location of the ancient Saketa city, which probably emerged as a marketplace located at the junction of the two important roads, the [[Shravasti]]-[[Pratishthana]] north–south road, and the [[Rajagriha]]-[[Varanasi]]-Shravasti-[[Taxila]] east–west road.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=13}} Ancient Buddhist texts, such as ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'', state that Saketa was located in the [[Kosala]] kingdom ruled by [[Prasenajit]] (or Pasenadi; c. 6th–5th century BC), whose capital was located at Shravasti.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=5, 13}} The later Buddhist commentary ''Dhammapada-[[atthakatha]]'' states that the Saketa town was established by merchant Dhananjaya (the father of [[Visakha]]), on the suggestion of king Prasenajit.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=5}} The ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' describes it as one of the six large cities of India.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=5}} The early Buddhist canonical texts mention [[Shravasti]] as the capital of Kosala, but the later texts, such as the Jain texts ''Nayadhammakahao'' and ''Pannavana Suttam'', and the Buddhist [[Jataka]]s, mention Saketa as the capital of Kosala.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=2,5–6}}

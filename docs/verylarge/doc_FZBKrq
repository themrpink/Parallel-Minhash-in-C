Kattowitz gained [[Town privileges|city status]] in 1865 in the Prussian [[Province of Silesia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; The city flourished due to large mineral (especially coal) deposits in the nearby mountains. Extensive city growth and prosperity depended on the coal mining and steel industries, which took off during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The city was inhabited mainly by [[Germans]], [[Silesians]], Jews and [[Poles]]. In 1884, 36 Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] delegates met here, forming the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement. Previously part of the Beuthen district, in 1873 it became the capital of the new [[Kattowitz (district)|Kattowitz district]]. On 1 April 1899, the city was separated from the district, becoming an [[independent city]].

Under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after [[World War I]], the [[Upper Silesia plebiscite]] was organised by the [[League of Nations]]. Though Kattowitz proper voted 22,774 to remain in Germany and 3,900 for Poland,&lt;ref name=Urban&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM2kvVUpCPYC&amp;q=urban+danzig|title=Von Krakau bis Danzig|accessdate=21 March 2009|publisher=Thomas Urban|year=2004|language=German|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024011628/http://books.google.de/books?id=bM2kvVUpCPYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=urban+danzig&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA143,M1|archive-date=24 October 2012|url-status=live|isbn=9783406510823}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was attached to Poland as the larger district voted 66,119 for Poland and 52,992 for Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Documents on British foreign policy, 1919-1939 Great Britain.

During the early stages of [[World War II]] and the [[Invasion of Poland|Poland Campaign]], Katowice was essentially abandoned, as the [[Polish Army]] had to position itself around [[Kraków]]. Under the [[Nazi]] occupation many of the city's historical and iconic monuments were destroyed, most notably the [[Great Synagogue, Katowice|Great Katowice Synagogue]], which was burned to the ground on 4 September 1939. This was followed by the alteration of street names and the introduction of strict rules. Additionally, the use of [[Polish language|Polish]] in public conversations was banned. The German administration was also infamous for organising public executions of civilians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Katowice/Katowice.html|title=Katowice, Poland|accessdate=17 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318003331/http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Katowice/Katowice.html|archivedate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the middle of 1941, most of the Polish and Jewish population was expelled. Eventually, Katowice was occupied by the [[Red Army]] in January 1945. Significant parts of the downtown and inner suburbs were demolished during the occupation. This, however, [[Pabst Plan|cannot be compared]] with [[Warsaw]], where the level of destruction reached 85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/30|title=Historic Centre of Warsaw|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|accessdate=17 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315182313/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/30/|archivedate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the authorities were able to preserve the central district in its prewar character.

The postwar period of Katowice was characterised by the time of heavy industry development in the Upper Silesian region, which helped the city in regaining its status as the most industrialised Polish city and a major administrative centre. As the city developed so briskly, the 1950s marked a significant increase in its population and an influx of migrants from the [[Eastern Borderlands]], the so-called ''Kresy''. The city area began to quickly expand by incorporating the neighbouring communes and counties. However, the thriving industrial city also had a dark period in its short but meaningful history. Most notably, between 7 March 1953 and 10 December 1956, Katowice was called ''Stalinogród'' in honour of [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dziennikzachodni.pl/artykul/3355309,katowice-zniknely-powstal-stalinogrod-to-juz-61-lat,id,t.html|title=Katowice zniknęły.

The following decades were more memorable in the history of Katowice. Regardless of its industrial significance, it started to become an important cultural and educational centre in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1968 the [[University of Silesia]], the largest and most valued college in the area, was founded. Simultaneously the construction of large housing estates began to evolve. Furthermore, many representative structures were erected at that time, including the [[Silesian Insurgents' Monument]] (1967) and [[Spodek]] (1971), which have become familiar landmarks and tourist sights. The 1960s and 1970s saw the evolution of [[modernist architecture]] and [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. Katowice eventually developed into one of the most modernist post-war cities of Poland.

One of the most dramatic events in the history of the city occurred on 16 December 1981. It was then that 9 protesters died (7 were shot dead; 2 died from injury complications) and another 21 were [[Pacification of Wujek|wounded in the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine]]. The [[Milicja Obywatelska|Special Platoon of the Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia]] (''ZOMO'') was responsible for the brutal handling of strikers protesting against [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]]'s declaration of [[Martial Law in Poland|martial law]] and the arrest of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity trade union]] officials. On the 10th anniversary of the event, a memorial was unveiled by the President of Poland [[Lech Wałęsa]].
 
In 1990 the first democratic local elections that took place marked a new period in the city's history. The economy of Katowice has been transforming from the heavy industry of steel and coal mines into &quot;one of the most attractive investment areas for modern economy branches in Central Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silesia-online.com/89,Stalinogrod_-_Post-War_History_.htm|title=Katowice Online – Stalinogrod – Post-War History of Katowice|first=Wirtualny Turysta|last=www.wirtualnyturysta.com|accessdate=15 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113211/http://www.silesia-online.com/89,Stalinogrod_-_Post-War_History_.htm|archivedate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the city's efficient infrastructure, rapid progress in the overall development and an increase in office space has made Katowice a popular venue for conducting business.

Katowice is in the ''Katowice Highlands'', part of the [[Silesian Highlands]], in the eastern part of [[Upper Silesia]], in the central portion of the [[Upper Silesian Coal Basin]]. Katowice is an [[Residential community|urban community]] in the [[Silesian Voivodeship]] in south-west Poland. It is central district of the [[Silesian Metropolis]]—a metropolis with a population of two million. It borders the cities of [[Chorzów]], [[Siemianowice Śląskie]], [[Sosnowiec]], [[Mysłowice]], [[Lędziny]], [[Tychy]], [[Mikołów]], [[Ruda Śląska]] and [[Czeladź]]. It lies between the [[Vistula]] and [[Oder]] rivers. Several rivers flow through the city, the major two being the [[Kłodnica]] and [[Rawa (river)|Rawa]].

At present, the city of Katowice is inhabited mostly by [[Poles]] and ethnic [[Silesians]], but also by several minorities of Germans, [[Czechs]] and [[Moravians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fact-index.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fact-index.com/s/si/silesia.html|title=Silesia|accessdate=16 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301080634/http://www.fact-index.com/s/si/silesia.html|archivedate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also makes the region religiously and culturally diverse. Over the years this diversity has strongly reflected on local architecture such as [[tenement]] housing and state buildings. The recent Polish census showed that the Silesians are the largest ethnic minority in Poland, with Germans being second on the list. Both of these minorities mostly live in the Silesian region. It is, therefore, the most multicultural province and [[Silesian Voivodeship|voivodeship of Poland]].

Prior to the [[Second World War]], Katowice was mainly inhabited by Poles and Germans. The 1905 Silesian demographic census has shown that Germans made up nearly 75% of the total population. Following Germany's defeat in 1945, the large German majority was forced to flee. Most pre-war citizens (excluding Poles) were violently expelled by the new authorities. This resulted in a large group of exiled Silesians living in present-day Germany, creating a new association of ''Landsmannschaft Schlesien''. One of its most notable spokesmen and leaders was the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] politician [[Herbert Hupka]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fact-index.com&quot;/&gt;

During the war, the Nazi occupant committed severe crimes against the local [[Holocaust|Gypsy and Jewish communities]]. Most of them were eventually killed or transported by cattle wagons to [[concentration camps]] such as [[Auschwitz]] for complete extermination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oshpitzin.pl/holocaust/|title=Holocaust – oshpitzin.pl|accessdate=16 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316210702/http://oshpitzin.pl/holocaust/|archivedate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a population drop between 1939 and 1945.

===Conurbation===
Katowice lies in the centre of the largest conurbation in Poland, one of the largest in [[European Union|the European Union]], numbering about 2.7&amp;nbsp;million. The [[Katowice urban area]] consists of about 40 adjacent cities and towns, the whole [[Silesian metropolitan area]] (mostly within the [[Upper Silesian Coal Basin]]) over 50 cities or towns. The [[metropolitan area]] has a population of 5,294,000. In 2006, Katowice and 14 adjacent cities united as the [[Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia|Upper Silesian Metropolis]]. Its population is 2 million and its area is 1,104&amp;nbsp;km². In 2006–2007 the union planned to unite these cities in one city under the name &quot;Silesia&quot;, but this proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|pl}} [http://www.dziennik.pl/Default.aspx?TabId=14&amp;ShowArticleId=24596 dziennik.pl – &quot;17 śląskich miast chce się połączyć w Silesię&quot;, 11 December 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031513/http://www.dziennik.pl/Default.aspx?TabId=14&amp;ShowArticleId=24596 |date=30 September 2007 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

The Katowice conurbation comprises settlements which have evolved because of the mining of metal ores, coal and raw rock materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Post-industrial Cultural Heritage Sites in the Katowice conurbation, Poland|journal=Environmental &amp; Socio-Economic Studies|first=Marzena|last=Lamparska|date=1 June 2013|volume=1|issue=2|pages=36–42|doi=10.1515/environ-2015-0011|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of mining and heavy industry which have developed for the past centuries has resulted in the unique character of the cityscape; its typical aspects are the [[Architecture of Poland|red brick housing estates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staypoland.com/about_katowice.htm|title=Katowice – Tourism – Tourist Information – Katowice, Poland -|first=StayPoland Sp. z|last=o.o.|accessdate=16 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316205004/http://www.staypoland.com/about_katowice.htm|archivedate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed for the poorer working class, factory chimneys, manufacturing plants, power stations and [[quarry|quarries]]. The inhabitants of a large mining community like Katowice, and local administrations within the conurbation, which have only evolved due to mining, are a subject to overall decline after the liquidation of coal mines and factories. This is one of the reasons which led to the development of the service sector, including office spaces, shopping centres and tourism.

Katowice did not originate as a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. The city centre was beginning to form in the mid-19th century when it was part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and had an ethnic German majority. The buildings of the time are decorated in an eclectic style (mostly [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] with elements of [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]]) and elements of [[Art Nouveau]] style ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''secesja''). By the end of the nineteenth century the centre was being referred to as a &quot;little Paris&quot; due to the presence of Parisian-styled [[Tenements|tenement houses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sztuka.net/palio/html.run?_Instance=www.sztuka.net.pl&amp;_PageID=445&amp;_RowID=&amp;newsId=516&amp;categoryId=208&amp;callingPageId=491&amp;_CheckSum=-1381753887|title=Wydawnictwo Muzeum Śląskiego: Lech Szaraniec &quot;Katowice w dawnej i współczesnej fotografii|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522094610/http://www.sztuka.net/palio/html.run?_Instance=www.sztuka.net.pl|archivedate=22 May 2009|access-date=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[Modernism]], especially [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] and [[Bauhaus]] inspired architecture, still coexist with modern office buildings in central Katowice. Between the 1950s and 1980s many socialist apartment blocks were constructed around the inner suburbs. Notable examples from that period include a multipurpose arena complex called ''[[Spodek]]'' and parts of [[Koszutka]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katowice.pjb.co.uk/flying-saucer-arrive-katowice/|title=When did a &quot;Flying Saucer&quot; arrive in Katowice? – Katowice|date=20 October 2016|accessdate=16 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317055204/http://katowice.pjb.co.uk/flying-saucer-arrive-katowice/|archivedate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katowice is one of the few cities in Poland where nearly all architectural styles are present. For instance, the [[Market square in Katowice]] (Polish: ''Rynek Katowicki'') is surrounded by a vast majority of buildings and edifices representing styles such as [[neoclassicism]], [[modernist architecture|modernism]], [[socialist realism]] and [[contemporary architecture|contemporary-modern]]. Some tenements have [[neogothic]] elements, which are an outstanding example of this type in Central and Eastern Europe. The street outlines, especially within the older inner districts, closely resemble the ones in Paris. Representational boulevards and promenades were established despite the city's strong industrial character. These, however, mostly adorned the city center and not working-class outer suburbs.

Unfortunately many old majestic buildings were demolished in the 1950s to make space for monumental modern blocks. Among other reasons for their destruction was the immense architectural detail which once represented the wealth of local industrialists and property owners. This particularly didn't fit in with the [[Polish People's Republic|Socialist-Communist authority]] at the time.

Today, the marketplace and several nearby streets with shopping [[Esplanade|promenade]]s are closed to traffic.

[[File:Katowice - Silesia City Center (2).jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Silesia City Center]] – a large shopping mall in Katowice. Located over former coal mine &quot;Gottwald&quot;]]

Despite relatively small size, Katowice is one of the major industrial, commerce and financial hubs of Poland. 

Katowice enjoys a very strong job market. Despite being 11th city in Poland in terms of population, Katowice is the 7th largest number of employed, with 171,839 full-time positions as of 2019. Katowice is also second only to Warsaw in number of commuters coming from other municipalities to work in the city, at 113,830 commuting to work in Katowice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=tuPolska|title=Przyjezdni pracownicy - Katowice ustępują tylko Warszawie|url=https://www.slaskibiznes.pl/wiadomosci,przyjezdni-pracownicy-katowice-ustepuja-tylko-warszawie,wia5-6-3512.html|access-date=2020-10-13|website=www.slaskibiznes.pl|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment rate in Katowice regularly ranks among the lowest in the country, and as of August 2020 it is the lowest in Poland at 1.5% (3,300 unemployed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=GUS|title=Bezrobotni zarejestrowani i stopa bezrobocia.

Katowice transformed its economy from a heavy industry-based to professional services, education and healthcare. As of 2020, it is classified as global Gamma- city according to [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]], on par with [[Poznań|Poznan]], [[Cleveland]] or [[Bilbao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=GaWC - The World According to GaWC 2020|url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html|access-date=2020-10-13|website=www.lboro.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Industry ===
Since its creation, Katowice's development was tightly connected to heavy industry, especially coal mining, steelworks and machine production. In 1931, 49.5% of inhabitants worked in industry, and 12.5% in coal mining alone. In 1989 industry accounted for 36% of all jobs in the city (112,000 employees). As of 2018, 34,294 people worked in industry in Katowice, 20.4% of total - below the national average. 

The first reported coal mine in Katowice (''Murcki'' coal mine) was established in 1740, and in 1769 construction on ''Emanuelssegen'' mine started. As the demand for coal kept rising in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], further mines were opened: ''Beata'' (1801), ''Ferdinand'' (1823), ''Kleofas'' (1845). Later in 19th and early 20th century additional mines were opened: ''Katowice'', ''Wujek'', ''Eminenz'' (later renamed ''Gottwald'' and merged with ''Kleofas''), ''Wieczorek'', ''Boże Dary'', ''Staszic'' and renewed ''Murcki''. Currently two remain in operation: [[Wujek Coal Mine|''Wujek'']] (scheduled to close in 2021) and ''Murcki-Staszic''. Katowice is also the seat of [[:pl:Polska_Grupa_Górnicza|Polska Grupa Górnicza]], the largest coal mining corporation in Europe. 

Metallurgy was another important part of Katowice's economy. In 1863 a dozen zinc metallurgy facilities were reported in Katowice, with ''Wilhelmina'' (founded in 1834) being the largest. In early 1900s, ''Wilhelmina'' (later renamed ''Huta Metali Niezależnych Szopienice'') was enlarged and became the largest Silesian producer of [[Non-ferrous metal|non-ferrous metals]] and world's largest producer of [[cadmium]]. Two major steelworks existed in the city: ''Huta Baildon'', established in 1823 by the Scottish engineer and industrialist [[John Baildon]] (declared bankruptcy in 2001), and ''Huta Ferrum'', established in 1874 and operating to this date in limited capacity. 

=== Business and commerce ===
Following the collapse of heavy industry in late 20th century, Katowice had to transform its economy towards more modern sectors. As a result, Katowice is a large business, conference and [[trade fair]] center. 

Katowice is headquarters to 18 public companies traded on the [[Warsaw Stock Exchange]], with total market value of PLN 24.2 billion as of 2016, with the largest being [[ING Bank Śląski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kwestarz|first=Piotr|date=2016-02-24|title=Interaktywna mapa ugiełdowienia Polski – sprawdź spółki w swoim mieście|url=https://strefainwestorow.pl/artykuly/20160224/interaktywna-mapa-ugieldowienia-polski-sprawdz-spolki-w-swoim-miescie|access-date=2020-10-13|website=StrefaInwestorow.pl|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2019, 38 companies from Katowice make the list of 2000 largest enterprises in Poland according to [[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]], with largest one being Tauron Polska Energia S.A. (10th place).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Firmy szybsze niż PKB|url=https://www.rp.pl/Lista-2000/312189870-Firmy-szybsze-niz-PKB.html|access-date=2020-10-13|website=www.rp.pl|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, 44,050 companies were registered in Katowice, almost 10% of all companies in the [[Silesian Voivodeship]].

Retail is a very strong sector in Katowice. The city is home to several shopping centers and department stores, with [[Silesia City Center]] and Galeria Katowicka being the largest ones. Silesia City Center, located on a [[Brownfield land|brownfield]] in place of a former coal mine, is the largest shopping center in Poland when number of stores is considered (310 different brands)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=B|first1=Jakub|last2=ura|date=2020-07-03|title=Największe galerie handlowe w Polsce|url=https://portfelpolaka.pl/najwieksze-galerie-handlowe-w-polsce/|access-date=2020-10-13|website=Portfel Polaka|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 7th largest in terms of retail space for rent (86,000 sq. m).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=TOP 10: Największe galerie handlowe w Polsce [FOTOGALERIA]|url=https://www.muratorplus.pl/inwestycje/inwestycje-komercyjne/top-10-najwieksze-galerie-handlowe-w-polsce-fotogaleria-aa-zY5f-6QZY-5D5F.html|access-date=2020-10-13|website=www.muratorplus.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a part of a broader revitalization complex, that features an apartment complex and office space (under construction as of October 2020) as well. 

Katowice is also the seat of ''Katowice [[Special Economic Zone]]'' (Katowicka Specjalna Strefa Ekonomiczna).

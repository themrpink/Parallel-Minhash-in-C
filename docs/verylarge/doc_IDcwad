'''Fritigern''' (fl. 370s) was a [[Thervingi]]an [[Goths|Gothic]] chieftain whose decisive victory at [[Battle of Adrianople|Adrianople]] during the [[Gothic War (376–382)]] led to favourable terms for the Goths when peace was made with [[Gratian]] and [[Theodosius I]] in 382.

==Name==
''Fritigern'' appears in the latinized form ''Fritigernus''.
The [[Gothic name]] is reconstructed as  *''Frithugairns'' &quot;desiring peace&quot;.
The Germanized name under which Fritigern is  honored in the [[Walhalla temple]] (1842) is ''Friediger''.

==Conflicts against Athanaric==

The earliest references to Fritigern concern the period between 
the attack on the [[Thervings|Thervingi]] by [[Valens]]  (367/9) and 
the [[Huns|Hunnic]] raids on the Thervingi (ca. 376). 
In this time, a civil war may have broken out between Fritigern and [[Athanaric]], a prominent Therving ruler. 
The conflict between Fritigern and Athanaric is mentioned by 
[[Socrates Scholasticus]], [[Sozomen]], and [[Zosimus]],&lt;ref&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, ''Church History'', book 4, chapter 33;
Sozomen, ''Church History'', book 6, chapter 37;
Zosimus, ''Historia Nova'', book 4.&lt;/ref&gt; but not by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and [[Philostorgius]].
Before or during this civil war, Fritigern converted to  [[Arianism|Arian Christianity]]. 
Athanaric's [[Gothic persecution of Christians|persecution of Christians]] mentioned by Sozomen, falls into this period.
Athanaric seems to have won this war, as he  later led the Thervingi in battle against the Huns in 376.{{sfn|Heather|2012|pp=159–60}}

According to Socrates, Fritigern and Athanaric were rival leaders of the (Therving) Goths. As this rivalry grew into warfare, Athanaric gained the advantage, and Fritigern asked for Roman aid. The Emperor Valens and the Thracian field army intervened, Valens and Fritigern defeated Athanaric, and Fritigern converted to Christianity, following the same teachings as Valens.&lt;ref&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, ''Church History'', book 4, chapter 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Sozomen follows Socrates' account.&lt;ref&gt;Sozomen, ''Church History'', book 6, chapter 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Zosimus, Athanaric (Athomaricus) was the king of the Goths (Scythians). Sometime after their victory at Adrianople, and after the accession of Theodosius, Fritigern, Alatheus, and Saphrax moved north of the Danube and defeated Athanaric, before returning south of the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, ''Historia Nova'', book 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Danube Crossing==
In 376, the Thervings came under increasing pressure from the [[Huns]], who had already conquered their kinsmen, the [[Greuthungs|Greuthungi]]. 
Fritigern asked Valens to allow the Thervingi to cross the northern Roman border and settle in [[Moesia]] or [[Thracia]], with the Danube River and Roman frontier forts protecting them from the Huns. 
Valens agreed to permit Fritigern's followers to enter the empire. In return, they would be subject to military service, but would be treated the same as other Roman subjects. As it turned out, neither happened.
Meanwhile, Athanaric and many of his followers retreated to [[Caucaland]] (&quot;the Highlands&quot;, presumably the [[The Sub Carpathians|Eastern Carpathians]] and [[Transylvania]]). 

During the autumn of 376, the Romans helped [[Alavivus]] and Fritigern's people cross the Danube and settle in the province of [[Moesia]]. In the winter of 376/7, a famine hit the areas settled by the Thervingi and their appeals for help went unanswered.{{sfn|Gibbon|1880|pp=142–43}} 
The Roman governors of the area, [[Lupicinus (comes rei militaris)|Lupicinus]] and [[Maximus of Moesia|Maximus]], treated them badly. They sold them food only at extremely high prices, which forced many Goths to sell their children as slaves. 
They invited several Thervingi leaders to a feast, in which they killed some and took others hostage. 
Alavivus most likely remained a hostage, but Fritigern was able to escape and he became leader of the Thervingi. Soon he declared war on the Roman Empire.

==War against Valens==
{{main|Gothic War (376–382)}}
Fritigen decisively defeated  [[Lupicinus (comes rei militaris)|Lupicinus]] at the [[Battle of Marcianople]] still in 376. 
The Goths went on to pillage [[Moesia]], and in the course of 377 gained control over most of the neighboring, richer province of [[Thracia]]. 
Valens, recognizing the severity of the situation, sent his general [[Traianus (magister peditum)|Traianus]] and asked for the aid 
of Western emperor [[Gratian]], who sent [[Richomeres]]
and [[Frigeridus (general)|Frigeridus]] to contain the Goths east of the [[Haemus Mons|Haemus]].
At the [[Battle of the Willows]], combined troops of the Western and Eastern Empire barely withstood a larger number of Goths, forcing Fritigern to withdraw into a [[Laager|wagon fort]] to recuperate. 
Valens now sent [[Saturninus (consul 383)|Saturninus]] to support Traianus.
Saturninus and Traianus built a number of fortifications to contain the Gothic camp, hoping to starve them out during the winter of 377/8 and to force them into an open field battle. Fritigern refused to abandon his fort, and instead managed to enlist the support of [[Huns|Hunnic]] and [[Alans|Alanic]] cavalry.
Saturninus could no longer maintain his blockade and was forced to retreat, returning freedom of movement to Fritigern who again took to pillaging the countryside. 
In the summer of 377, the Goths had regained access to the [[Hellespont]] and the Black Sea. They sacked [[Battle of Dibaltum|Dibaltum]]
and [[Augusta Trajana]], forcing Frigiderus to retreat to Illyria.
The Goths now threatened [[Constantinople]] itself, 
and Valens was forced to extract significant forces from the Persian front, granting considerable concessions to the Sassanids.
According to Socrates Scholasticus, the citizens of the capital accused  Valens of neglecting their defense, urging him to confront the invaders.
Valens moved his army to [[Melantias]] on 12 June, and sent 
[[Sebastianus (magister peditum)|Sebastianus]] with an advance force to engage Gothic raiding parties.
Sebastianus successfully destroyed a number of raiding parties, forcing Fritigern to consolidate his forces in the area of [[Cabyle]].
Gratian was detained in the north in his campaign against the [[Alemanni]] ([[Battle of Argentovaria]]), and unable to support Valens, who had been waiting to engage the Goths throughout June and July. When Valens heard that the Goths were moving towards Adrianople, 
he decamped and marched to meet them. 
Around 7 August, Richomeres returned from the Western campaign with the message that Gratian was now approaching.
According to Ammianus, Victor cautioned Valens to wait for Gratian, while Sebastianus urged for an immediate assault.
Fritigern sent envoys with two letters on the night of 8 August
The first letter offered peace and a military alliance in exchange for territory in Thrace. The second letter, addressed privately to Valens, assured that he wished for peace, but asked Valens to remain mobilized so that he, Fritigern, could convince his own people of maintaining the peace.
Valens rejected the proposal and marched to engage the Goths on the following day. Fritigern won a respite by further peace negotiations allowing his allied Greuthungi cavalry to draw near.
In the ensuing [[Battle of Adrianople]], the Goths won a decisive victory.
The Roman army was routed and suffered heavy losses. Valens himself was killed in the aftermath of the battle.
Fritigern besieged the city of Adrianople itself, without success.

The Goths retook control of much of the Balkan peninsula in the aftermath of the battle. The Eastern empire, now without an emperor, feared that the Gothic populations would ally themselves with Fritigern leading to widespread insurgence. Julius, successor to Lupicinus, 
ordered the massacre of all Goths living near the frontier.
By 379, word of the massacres reached the Goths living in the interior provinces, leading to riots in Asia Minor. The Romans reacted by massacring the Goths in the interior provinces as well.

Fritigern continued the war for two years, with mixed success. [[Theodosius I]] succeeded Valens as emperor on 19 January 379. Gratian did  acknowledge Theodosius as his co-emperor and granted him control over the imperial dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia, but he  promptly returned to his northern front to deal with the Alemanni, leaving Theodosius to deal with the Gothic problem.

Theodosius drafted a new army from farmers and mercenaries.
Many attempted to avoid the draft, some mutilating their own thumbs to avoid military service, and Theodosius responded with harsh punishments for deserters, forcing even those who had mutilated themselves into service.
Theodosius' general Modares, a Goth himself, won a minor victory against Fritigern.&lt;ref&gt;Kulikowski, 2006, pp. 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that at this point, the Greuthungi split off the Gothic army and went to [[Diocese of Pannonia|Illyricum]]. The Thervingi under Fritigern moved towards Greece, into [[Diocese of Macedonia|Macedonia and Thessaly]]. Theodosius moved to intercept them, but his army disintegrated from desertions [[Battle of Thessalonica (380)|at Thessalonica]], many of the barbarian mercenaries joining Fritigern.
At this point, Gratian was once again willing to come to aid, and his generals 
[[Arbogast (magister militum)|Arbogast]] and [[Flavius Bauto|Bauto]] successfully drove the Gothis back into Thrace by the summer of 381. 
Peace negotiations were opened, with 
Richomeres and Saturninus conducting the negotiations for the Romans.
Peace was declared on 3 October 382.
Fritigern is not mentioned again in any source after 381, and his fate is uncertain, he may have been killed in the Greek campaign, or he may have been deposed as a condition for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Heather, 2005, pp. 185–186; Kulikowski, 2006, pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victor Lustig''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvɪktoɐ̯ ˈlʊstɪç}}; January 4, 1890 &amp;ndash; March 11, 1947)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biography.com/people/victor-lustig-20657385 | title=Victor Lustig | website = [[Biography.com]] | accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.angelfire.com/pro/hoaxes/VictorLustig.htm | title=Biography of Victor Lustig | work=Hoaxes, Scams, &amp; Con Artists | accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a highly skilled [[confidence trick|con artist]] from [[Austria-Hungary]], who undertook a criminal career that involved conducting scams across Europe and the United States during the early 20th century. Lustig is widely regarded as one of the most notorious con artists of his time, and is infamous for being &quot;the man who sold the [[Eiffel Tower]] twice&quot; and for conducting the &quot;Rumanian Box&quot; scam.

==Early life==
Victor Lustig was born in [[Hostinné]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He was exceptionally gifted at learning throughout his youth, but also proved himself to be a source of trouble. At the age of 19, while taking a break from his studies in [[Paris]], Lustig took to [[gambling]]. During this time he received a scar to the left side of his face from the jealous boyfriend of a woman he consorted with.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lus Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/victor-lustig-20657385|title=Victor Lustig Biography|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon leaving school, Lustig applied both his education and his fluency in several languages to embark on a life of crime, eventually focusing on conducting a variety of [[scam]]s and [[confidence trick|cons]] that provided him with property and money, and which transformed him into a professional [[con man]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RADIO&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.radio.cz/en/article/46320 | title = Victor Lustig - the man who (could have) sold the world | first = Jan | last = Velinger | publisher = [[Radio Prague]] | date = 15 October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Lustig's initial cons were committed on ocean liners sailing between the Atlantic ports of France and [[New York City]];&lt;ref name=&quot;RADIO&quot;/&gt; amongst the schemes he pulled on rich travellers included one in which he posed as a musical producer who sought investment in a non-existent [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. When the services of Trans-Atlantic liners were suspended in the wake of [[World War I]], Lustig found himself in search of new territory to make an income from, and opted to travel to the United States. By this time, he began to earn a level of infamy amongst various law enforcement agencies for the scams he committed, including one he conducted in 1922 in which he conned a bank into giving him money for a portion of [[Liberty bond|bonds]] he was offering for a repossessed property, only to use [[sleight of hand]] to escape with both the money and the bonds.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lus Bio&quot; /&gt;

==&quot;Eiffel Tower&quot; scam==
In 1925, Lustig traveled back to France. While staying in Paris, he chanced upon a newspaper article discussing the problems faced with maintaining the [[Eiffel Tower]], which gave him inspiration for a new con. At the time, the monument had begun to fall into disrepair, and the city was finding it increasingly expensive to maintain and repaint it. Part of the article made a passing comment that overall public opinion on the monument would move towards calls for its removal, which was the key to convincing Lustig that using it as part of his next con would be lucrative.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lus Bio&quot; /&gt; After researching what he needed to help him utilize the information from the article, Lustig set to work preparing the scam, which included hiring a forger to produce fake government [[stationery]] for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lus Tow&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/12809/smooth-operator-how-victor-lustig-sold-eiffel-tower|title=Smooth Operator: How Victor Lustig Sold The Eiffel Tower|date=17 October 2012|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once he was ready, Lustig invited a small group of scrap metal dealers to a confidential meeting at an expensive hotel, whereupon he identified himself to them as the Deputy Director General of the Ministère de Postes et Télégraphes (Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs).&lt;ref name= &quot;Lus Bio&quot; /&gt; In the meeting, he convinced the men that the upkeep of the Eiffel Tower was becoming too much for Paris and that the French government wished to sell it for scrap, but that because such a deal would be controversial and likely spark public outcry, nothing could be disclosed until all the details were thought out. Lustig revealed that he was in charge of selecting the dealer who would receive ownership of the structure, claiming that the group had been selected carefully because of their reputations as &quot;honest businessmen&quot;. His speech included genuine insight about the monument's place in the city and how it did not fit in with the city's other great monuments like the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[cathedral]]s or the [[Arc de Triomphe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lus Tow&quot; /&gt;

During his time with the dealers, Lustig kept watch on who would be the most likely to fall for his scam, and found his mark in André Poisson—an insecure man who wished to rise up amongst the inner circles of the Parisian business community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lus Pois&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2015/01/man-sold-eiffel-tower-twice/|title=THE MAN WHO SOLD THE EIFFEL TOWER|date=14 January 2015|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Poisson showed the keenest interest in purchasing the monument, Lustig decided to focus on him once the dealers sent their bids to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lus Pois&quot; /&gt; Arranging a private meeting with Poisson, Lustig convinced him that he was a corrupt official, claiming that his government position did not give him a generous salary for the lifestyle he wished to enjoy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smoothest&quot;/&gt; Believing the sale of the Eiffel Tower would secure him a place amongst the top businessmen, Poisson agreed to pay a large [[bribery|bribe]] to secure ownership of the Eiffel Tower. However, once Lustig received his bribe and the funds for the monument's &quot;sale&quot; (around 70,000 francs), he soon fled to [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lus Tow&quot; /&gt;

Lustig suspected that when Poisson found out he had been conned, he would be too ashamed and embarrassed to inform the French police of what he had been caught up in, yet despite this belief, he maintained a check on newspapers while in Austria. His suspicions soon proved to be correct when he could find no reference of his con within their pages, and thus he decided to return to Paris later that year to pull off the scheme once more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lus Tow&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smoothest&quot;/&gt; However, when Lustig attempted to con another group of dealers and had managed to find a mark among them willing to buy the Eiffel Tower, the police were informed about the scam and he fled to the U.S. to evade arrest.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lus Bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lus Pois&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smoothest&quot;/&gt;

==The &quot;Rumanian Box&quot; scam==
One of Lustig's most notable scams involved selling unsuspecting marks a box that he claimed was a machine that could duplicate any currency bills that were inserted into it, with the only catch being that the device needed six hours to print an identical copy. Referred to as the &quot;money box&quot; or &quot;Rumanian Box&quot;, the scam involved a specially designed mahogany box, roughly the size of a steamer trunk. The box's design featured two small slots designed to take in bills and the paper to &quot;print&quot; the duplicate on, and a compartment containing a false arrangement of levers and mechanisms that had to be &quot;operated&quot; to make the duplicates.

In order to convince the mark it truly worked, Lustig would ask them to give him a specific denomination of bill (e.g. $100), insert it into his device along with the paper, and then wait with them until the duplicate was made. When it had, Lustig would take the mark with him to a bank to authenticate the note. In reality, the mark would be unaware of the fact that Lustig had concealed a genuine note within the device; the choice of denomination was influenced by what he put into the box beforehand. Once the mark was convinced, Lustig would refuse to sell them the box until they offered him a high price for it. Before it was sold, Lustig would pack the box with additional genuine notes, to buy him time to make a clean escape, before his mark realised they had been conned.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lus Bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smoothest&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lus Pois&quot; /&gt;

One of Lustig's most infamous uses of the device was upon a [[Texas]] sheriff, whom he convinced to buy it for thousands of dollars. Upon realising he had been tricked, the sheriff pursued Lustig to [[Chicago]]. Upon meeting him again, the sheriff was conned into believing that he was not operating the device correctly, and was handed a large sum of cash as compensation, unaware that the money was [[counterfeit currency|counterfeit]]. This counterfeiting would eventually lead to his arrest by American law enforcement officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smoothest&quot;/&gt;

==Later years, capture, &amp; death==
When the [[Great Depression]] hit, Lustig concocted a risky scam aimed at [[Al Capone]], knowing that he faced certain death if his mark realized he was being conned. For Lustig, the scam was not a straight-out con, but one designed to get his target to part with a relatively small amount of cash. Lustig asked Capone to invest $50,000 in a crooked scheme, then kept the money given to him in a [[safe deposit box]] for two months before returning it, claiming the deal had fallen through. Capone got the impression that he was dealing with an honest man. At this point, Lustig told Capone that the failure of the deal meant he had lost all means of supporting himself. He then convinced Capone to give him $5,000 ($1,000, according to other sources&lt;ref name=&quot;Lus Tow&quot;/&gt;) to &quot;tide him over&quot;, as Lustig had originally planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;RADIO&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smoothest&quot;/&gt;

In 1930, Lustig went into a partnership with two men from [[Nebraska]]—pharmacist William Watts and chemist Tom Shaw—to conduct a large scale counterfeiting operation. Both Watts and Shaw engraved the plates that would be used to manufacture the counterfeit dollar bills, while Lustig organised a ring of couriers to distribute the forgeries, ensuring that they were kept in the dark regarding the production of the counterfeits.&lt;ref name=&quot;doremus&quot;/&gt; In short, the operation managed to circulate thousands of dollars of counterfeit money each month for the next five years, nicknamed &quot;Lustig money&quot;, though the increasing amount entering the U.S. economy eventually drew the attention of federal agents.

When Lustig's mistress, Billy May, learnt he was betraying her for Shaw's young mistress, she decided to take revenge and placed an anonymous phone call to the federal authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;doremus&quot;&gt;The Passing Parade - [[John Doremus]]. Evenings with George Illich, [[2CH|Radio 2CH]], 20:40 ADST, 14 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May 1935, Lustig was arrested in New York and charged with counterfeiting. Although he openly admitted to his partners' involvement in the operation, he himself feigned ignorance in the matter. However, Lustig's refusal to disclose information on a key found in his possession proved to be his undoing, as it was later found to open a locker in the [[Times Square]] subway station containing $51,000 in counterfeit bills and the plates with which they had been printed.&lt;ref name= &quot;Smoothest&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine| title=The Smoothest Con Man That Ever Lived | first=Gilbert |last=King| magazine=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]| url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2012/08/the-smoothest-con-man-that-ever-lived/|  date=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day before his trial, Lustig managed to escape from the [[The Tombs|Federal House of Detention]] in New York City by faking illness and using a specially made rope to climb out of the building, but he was recaptured 27 days later in [[Pittsburgh]]. Lustig pleaded guilty at his trial and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison on [[Alcatraz Island]], [[California]] for his original charge, with a further five years for his prison escape. On 9 March 1947, Lustig contracted [[pneumonia]] and was pronounced dead two days later at the [[Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield|Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], [[Missouri]]. On his death certificate his occupation was listed as apprentice salesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = James F. | last1 = Johnson | first2 = Floyd | last2 = Miller | title = The Man Who Sold the Eiffel Tower | date = 1961 | publisher = Doubleday &amp; Company Inc. | pages = 216 | lccn = 61009522  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ten Commandments==
A set of instructions known as the &quot;Ten Commandments for Con Men&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lindskoog, Katherine Ann.; [https://books.google.com/books?id=CEJjuJnu1O4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=psQIV6eg0K&amp;dq=Fakes%2C%20Frauds%20%26%20Other%20Malarkey&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Fakes, Frauds &amp; other malarkey'']&lt;/ref&gt; has been attributed to Lustig:

* Be a patient listener (it is this, not fast talking, that gets a con man his coups). 
* Never look bored. 
* Wait for the other person to reveal any political opinions, then agree with them. 
* Let the other person reveal religious views, then have the same ones. 
* Hint at sex talk, but don't follow it up unless the other person shows a strong interest. 
* Never discuss illness, unless some special concern is shown. 
* Never pry into a person's personal circumstances (they'll tell you all eventually). 
* Never boast - just let your importance be quietly obvious. 
* Never be untidy. 
* Never get drunk.

'''Albert Abrams''' (December 8, 1863 – January 13, 1924) was a controversial American [[physician]], well known during his life for inventing machines, such as the &quot;Oscilloclast&quot; and the &quot;Radioclast&quot;, which he falsely claimed could diagnose and cure almost any disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmaw.org/dr-albert-abrams-controversial-doctor-of-san-francisco/|website=Jewish Museum of the American West | title=Dr. Albert Abrams: Controversial Doctor of San Francisco |access-date=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were challenged from the outset. Towards the end of his life, and again shortly after his death, many of his machines and conclusions were demonstrated to be intentionally deceptive or false.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Rinn|Rinn, Joseph]]. (1950). ''Searchlight on Psychical Research''. Rider and Company. p. 248. &quot;After the death of Dr. Abrams in 1924 it was proved that he was a faker, and that the claims he had made for his &quot;oscilloclast&quot; were absurd. This wonder box, when opened, was found to contain a small motor hooked up to an electric battery that made a purring noise, nothing else.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Albert Abrams was born in [[San Francisco]] December 8, 1863, although other dates have also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=229592 JAMA. 1922;78(14):107–73]. {{doi|10.1001/jama.1922.02640670058034}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 8, 1878, he inscribed at [[Cooper Medical College|Medical College of the Pacific]], worked as an assistant of Prof. Douglass and Prof. Hirschfelder, and got a medical degree on October 30, 1881. Then he went to [[Heidelberg]], Germany, and graduated there in November 1882
&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Albert_Abrams_Curiculum_Vitae,_written_by_himself_in_Heidelberg.jpg Curriculum Vitae, hand-written by Albert Abrams, Heidelberg, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;
before undertaking further studies in London, Berlin, Vienna, and Paris.
According to Wilson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap26/chap26-sect6.html Wilson, Stanford University School of Medicine and the Predecessor Schools: An Historical Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110051905/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap26/chap26-sect6.html |date=2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams was awarded an M.D. by the Cooper College in 1883. He served on the teaching staff of the College for a total of fourteen years: five years (1885–1889) as Demonstrator of Pathology; four years (1890–1893) as Adjunct to the Chair of Clinical Medicine and Demonstrator of Pathology; and five years (1894–1898) as Professor of Pathology.
He was elected vice-president of the California State Medical Society in 1889 and was made president of the San Francisco Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1893. In the beginning of the 1900s he had become a respected expert in neurology. From 1904 he was president of the Emanuel Polyclinic in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;[https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5537721W/Report_on_radionics-science_of_the_future. Russell, Edward, Report on Radionics, (London: Neville Spearman), p. 17]&lt;/ref&gt;
Abrams published numerous books from 1891 to 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL2390254A/Albert_Abrams?sort=old#editions. Albert Abrams, List of published books on openlibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
He died January 13, 1924, from a broncho-pneumonia in San Francisco.

==Practice==
===Heidelberg doctorate claim===
Abrams was accused of fraudulently claiming a medical qualification from the [[University of Heidelberg]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/ History of Stanford medical school and predecessors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214023220/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/ |date=2006-02-14 }} : [http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap26/chap26-sect6.html Chapter 26] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110051905/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap26/chap26-sect6.html |date=2013-11-10 }} Wilson&lt;/ref&gt; However documents from Archive of University Heidelberg confirm that Albert Abrams received a medical degree there on 21 November 1882.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:M.D._Certificate_of_Albert_Abrams_from_Ruprecht-Karls-Universit%C3%A4t_Heidelberg,_21.11.1882.jpg Certificate of Doctors Degree, Albert Abrams, University of Heidelberg, 1882].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Abrams' view, American medicine was dominated by physicians with excessive admiration for German doctors and researchers. In earlier writings, he insulted physicians by calling them &quot;Dr. Hades&quot; or &quot;Dr. Inferior&quot;, by comparing their looks to typhoid and other [[Microorganism|germs]], and by making fun of various abstruse therapies that at the time were considered &quot;scientific&quot; by the medical establishment. In a poem that he wrote on balloon therapy, for instance, the doctors take their patients up in the air but do not know how to bring the balloon down again. The poem ends with the lines: ''But they never came back. That's why we confess / Aëronautic therapy is not a success''.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abrams: ''Transactions of the Antiseptic Club'', E.G. Treat, New York 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spondylotherapy===
Abrams developed a medical technique called spondylotherapy, which was inspired by [[chiropractic]] and [[osteopathy|osteopathic]] ideas. The basic principle is the stimulation of nerves originating from the spinal cord, which can trigger [[reflex]] actions on [[viscera]] or inner organs. The stimulation is performed by controlled concussion with a plexor / [[pleximeter]] combination directly on the [[spinous process]]es, by sinusoidal electric currents or by application of ice. Abrams published the book ''Spondylotherapy'' in several editions between 1910 and 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spondylotherapy |author=Albert Abrams |year=1910 |publisher=Philopolis Press |isbn= |url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL7722659W/Spondylotherapy_Physio_and_Pharmaco-therapy_and_Diagnostic_Methods_Based_on_.. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A simplified version of spondylotherapy was first published by Alva Emeey Gregory, M.D. in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spondylotherapy simplified  |author= Alva Emeey Gregory, M.D. |year=1922 |publisher= Alva Emeey Gregory, M.D. |isbn= |url= https://openlibrary.org/works/OL7759351W/Spondylotherapy_simplified }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic Reactions of Abrams==
{{main|Radionics}}

Abrams promoted an idea that [[electrons]] were the basic element of all life. He called this '''ERA''', for '''Electronic Reactions of Abrams''', and introduced a number of different machines which he claimed were based on these principles.

===The machines===
The Dynomizer looked something like a [[radio]], and Abrams claimed it could diagnose any known [[disease]] from a single drop of [[blood]] or alternatively the subject's handwriting. He performed diagnoses on dried blood samples sent to him on pieces of paper in envelopes through the mail. Apparently Abrams even claimed he could conduct medical practice over the [[telephone]] with his machines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=New Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment|author=Albert Abrams|year=1922|publisher=Physico-Clinical Co|isbn=
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xNOAOd2dAWkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=New+concepts+in+diagnosis+and+treatment
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he could determine [[wikt:personality|personality]] characteristics.

The Dynomizer was big business; by 1918, courses in spondylotherapy and ERA cost $200 (about the same purchasing power as $3,150 in 2014); equipment was leased at about $200 with a monthly $5 charge thereafter. The lessee had to sign a contract stating the device would never be opened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seanet.com/~raines/abrams.html Dr. Albert Abrams and the E.R.A.&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716084138/http://www.seanet.com/~raines/abrams.html|date=2006-07-16}} at www.seanet.com&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams explained that this would disrupt their delicate adjustment, but the rule also served to prevent the Abrams devices from being examined. He then widened his claims to treating the diagnosed diseases. Abrams came up with new and even more impressive gadgets, the &quot;Oscilloclast&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanartifacts.com/smma/abrams/a11.gif Oscilloclast]&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;Radioclast&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.webshots.com/photo/1014428668027916608tHhVZmlhwZ Radioclast]&lt;/ref&gt; which came with tables of [[frequencies]] that were designed to &quot;attack&quot; specific diseases. Clients were told cures required repeated treatments.

Dynomizer operators tended to give alarming diagnoses, involving combinations of such maladies as [[cancer]], [[diabetes]] and [[syphilis]]. Abrams often included a disease called &quot;bovine syphilis,&quot; unknown to other medical practitioners. He claimed the Oscilloclast was capable of defeating most of these diseases, most of the time.

By 1921, there were claimed to be 3,500 practitioners using ERA technology. Conventional medical practitioners were extremely suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GLIxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Albert+Abrams%22+3,500&amp;dq=%22Albert+Abrams%22+3,500&amp;pgis=1 CA: A Journal for Cancer Clinicians, 1950]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Bob DeVries, a product designer for [[Hewlett-Packard]], had a chance to repair an old Oscilloclast (1934). It was owned by a lady, whose father had been a president of Abrams' Electronic Medical Foundation and improver of their devices; she had several such devices and believed that electric therapy to be beneficial, from her own experience. DeVries not only restored the old oscilloclast to working order, but also developed a [[transistor]]ized version for his client, which they called a &quot;Pulsed Oscillator&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hpmemory.org/timeline/bob_devries/some_memories_06.htm#part_06_chapt_14 |title=[Medical consulting using low-level RF treatment].

==Investigation==
The dispute between Abrams and his followers and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) was intensified. Defenders included American radical author [[Upton Sinclair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Upton Sinclair's Story About Dr. Abrams and His Work| newspaper =The Miami News| date =November 25, 1922
| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=um5VAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4265,416343&amp;dq=albert+abrams+healer&amp;hl=en| accessdate =July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the famously credulous Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], the creator of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Resolution of the dispute through the intervention of a scientifically respected third party was pursued. ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine decided to investigate Dr. Abrams' claims. ''Scientific American'' was interested in the matter as readers were writing letters to the editor saying that Abrams' revolutionary machines were one of the greatest inventions of the century and so needed to be discussed in the pages of the magazine.

''Scientific American'' assembled a team of investigators who worked with a senior Abrams associate given the pseudonym &quot;Doctor X&quot;. The investigators developed a series of tests and the magazine asked readers to suggest their own tests. The investigators asked Doctor X to identify six vials containing unknown [[pathogens]]. It seems likely that Doctor X honestly believed in his Abrams machines; in fact, he allowed the ''Scientific American'' investigators to observe his procedure. Doctor X got the contents of all six vials completely wrong. He examined the vials and pointed out that they had labels in red ink, which produced vibrations that confounded the instruments. The investigators gave him the vials again with less offensive labels, and he got the contents wrong again.

The festival was formed in 2015 as a result of public consultation within the town. The first festival was held in 2016. It is organised by Caernarfon Food Festival Group which is made up of local volunteers who hold regular meetings to plan each festival. The festival has a number of supporting groups, including a content group, sponsorship group, technical group, communication group and volunteer group. These groups feed into the main group's monthly meetings. The festival logo was inspired by contributions from pupils at [[Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen]], and designed by Iestyn Lloyd of Cwmni Da. &lt;ref name=&quot;Gwyl Fwyd Caernarfon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;My Llandudno&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myllandudno.co.uk/event/caernarfon-food-festival/|title=My Llandudno, Caernarfon Food Festival }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival has been supported by [[Welsh Government]] through the Food Festival Grant Scheme and was highly commended by Food Awards Wales in 2019. &lt;ref name=&quot;Gwyl Fwyd Caernarfon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://swshi.co.uk/events/2019/5/11/gwyl-fwyd-caernarfon-food-festival-2019|title=Swshi, Gwyl Fwyd Caernarfon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Car parking is provided at the Slate Quay (Cei Llechi) and at other car parks around the town while the [[Welsh Highland Railway]] provides transport from [[Porthmadog]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Post&quot;/&gt; Cycle access is by the cycle tracks along the disused railway lines which include Lôn Las Eifion, which runs from Porthmadog, by-passing [[Penygroes, Gwynedd|Penygroes]], and on to Caernarfon, Lôn Las Menai from [[Felinheli]] to Caernarfon and Lôn Las Peris from [[Llanberis]] to Caernarfon. &lt;ref name=&quot;Gwyl Fwyd Caernarfon&quot;/&gt;

The '''Free Trade Area of the Americas''' ('''FTAA''') was a proposed agreement to eliminate or reduce the [[trade barriers]] among all countries in the [[Americas]], excluding [[Cuba]]. Negotiations to establish the FTAA ended in failure, however, with all parties unable to reach an agreement by the 2005 deadline they had set for themselves.

==History==
In the last round of negotiations, trade ministers from 34 countries met in [[Miami]], Florida, in the United States, in November 2003 to discuss the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ftaa-alca.org/Ministerials/Miami/Miami_e.asp |title= ALCA - FTAA - ZLEA - Ministerial Declaration - Miami 2003 |publisher= Ftaa-alca.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed agreement was an extension of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) between Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Opposing the proposal were [[Cuba]], [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Dominica]], and [[Nicaragua]] (all of which entered the [[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]] in response), and [[Mercosur]] member states.
Discussions have faltered over similar points as the [[Doha Development Round]] of [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) talks; developed nations sought expanded trade in [[Service Sector|services]] and increased [[intellectual property]] rights, while less developed nations sought an end to [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] and free trade in agricultural goods. Similar to the WTO talks, Brazil took a leadership role among the less developed nations, while the United States took a similar role for the developed nations.

===Origins===
Free Trade Area of the Americas began with the [[Summit of the Americas]] in Miami, Florida, on December 11, 1994, but the FTAA came to public attention during the [[Quebec City Summit of the Americas]], held in Canada in 2001, a meeting targeted by massive [[anti-corporatization]] and [[anti-globalization]] protests. The Miami negotiations in 2003 met similar protests, though not as large.

===Disagreements===
In previous negotiations, the United States had pushed for a single comprehensive agreement to reduce trade barriers for goods, while increasing intellectual property protection. Specific intellectual property protections could include [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] style copyright protections similar to the [[U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement]]. Another protection would likely have restricted the importation or cross importation of pharmaceuticals, similar to the proposed agreement between the United States and Canada. Brazil posed a three-track approach that called for a series of bilateral agreements to reduce specific tariffs on goods, a hemispheric pact on [[rules of origin]], and a dispute resolution process Brazil proposed to omit the more controversial issues from the FTA, leaving them to the WTO.

The location of the FTA Secretariat was to have been determined in 2005. The contending cities were: [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], and [[Miami]] in the United States; [[Cancún]] and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] in Mexico; [[Panama City]], Panama; and [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The U.S. city of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] also submitted its candidacy in the early days but subsequently withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftaa-alca.org/tnc/candidate_e.asp |title=ALCA - FTA - ZLEA - Candidate Cities for the Permanent Site of the FTAA Secretariat |publisher=Ftaa-alca.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miami, Panama City and Puebla served successively an interim secretariat headquarters during the negotiation process.

The last summit was held at [[Mar del Plata]], Argentina, in November 2005, but no agreement on FTA was reached. Of the 39 countries present at the negotiations, 20 pledged to meet again in 2006 to resume negotiations, but no meeting took place. The failure of the Mar del Plata summit to establish a comprehensive FTA agenda augured poorly.

===Current status===
{{update|date=July 2016}}
The FTAA missed the targeted deadline of 2005, which followed the stalling of useful negotiations of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article?id=161362709 ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, some governments, most notably the United States, not wanting to lose any chance of hemispheric trade expansion moved in the direction of establishing a series of bilateral trade deals. The leaders however, planned further discussions at the [[6th Summit of the Americas]] in Cartagen, Colombia in 2012, although these discussions did not take place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacklistednews.com/news-1032-0-9-9--.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/ht/d/sp/i/267/pid/267 |title=About AFSC &amp;#124; Friends Service Committee |publisher=Afsc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and opposition==
A vocal critic of the FTAA was Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]], who has described it as an &quot;[[annexation]] plan&quot; and a &quot;tool of [[imperialism]]&quot; for the exploitation of Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;crwflags1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/int-bapa.html |title=Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) |publisher=Crwflags.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a counterproposal to this initiative, Chávez promoted the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]] (''Alianza Bolivariana para las Américas'', ALBA) which emphasizes energy and infrastructure agreements that are gradually extended to other areas finally to include the total economic, political and military integration of the member states.&lt;ref name=&quot;crwflags1&quot;/&gt; [[Evo Morales]] of Bolivia has referred to the U.S.-backed Free Trade Area of the Americas, as &quot;an agreement to legalize the colonization of the Americas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upsidedownworld.org/main/bolivia-archives-31/38-an-interview-with-evo-morales-120803 |title=An Interview with Evo Morales (12/08/03) |publisher=Upsidedownworld.org |date=2005-10-16 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the then presidents of Brazil, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], and Argentina, [[Néstor Kirchner]], have stated that they do not oppose the FTAA but they do demand that the agreement provide for the elimination of U.S. agriculture [[subsidy|subsidies]], the provision of effective access to foreign markets and further consideration towards the needs and sensibilities of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gill |first=Nathan |url=http://www.southernaffairs.org/2008_04_01_archive.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408141442/http://www.southernaffairs.org/2008_04_01_archive.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-04-08 |title=April 2008 |publisher=Southern Affairs |accessdate=2013-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most contentious issues of the treaty proposed by the United States is with concerns to [[patent]]s and [[copyright]]s. Critics claim that if the measures proposed by the United States were implemented and applied this would reduce scientific research in Latin America. On the [[left-wing]] [[Council of Canadians]] web site, Barlow wrote: &quot;This agreement sets enforceable global rules on patents, copyrights and trademark. It has gone far beyond its initial scope of protecting original inventions or cultural products and now permits the practice of patenting plants and animal forms as well as seeds. It promotes the private rights of corporations over local communities and their genetic heritage and traditional medicines&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ratical.org/co-globalize/MBonFTAA.html|title=Council of Canadians: Campaigns: Trade and Investment: Publications: The Free Trade Area of the Americas by Maude Barlow|website=ratical.org|access-date=2020-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the weekend of April 20, 2001, the [[3rd Summit of the Americas]] was a [[Summit (meeting)|summit]] held in [[Quebec City]], Canada. This international meeting was a round of negotiations regarding a proposed FTAA.

==Agreements==
There are currently 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere, stretching from Canada to Chile that still have the FTAA as a long-term goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/blokit/ftaa.htm |title=Free Trade Area of Americas (FTAA) |publisher=Actrav.itcilo.org |date=1997-05-16 |accessdate=2013-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518105444/http://actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/blokit/ftaa.htm |archive-date=2010-05-18 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Implementation of a full multilateral FTAA between all parties could be made possible by enlargement of existing agreements.

The '''pawn''' (♙,♟) is the most numerous [[chess piece|piece]] in the game of [[chess]] and, in most circumstances, also the weakest. It historically represents [[infantry]], or more particularly, armed [[peasant]]s or [[pikemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://j.whyville.net/smmk/whytimes/article?id=5811|title=Chess Pieces and their Meanings|author=Titanic|website=The Whyville Times|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of the {{chessgloss|rank}} immediately in front of the other pieces. (The white pawns start on a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2; the black pawns start on a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7.)

Individual pawns are referred to by the {{chessgloss|file}} on which they stand. For example, one speaks of &quot;White's f-pawn&quot; or &quot;Black's b-pawn&quot;. Alternatively, they can be referred to by the piece which stood on that file at the beginning of the game, e.g. &quot;White's king bishop's pawn&quot; or &quot;Black's queen knight's pawn&quot;. It is also common to refer to a ''{{chessgloss|rook's pawn}}'', meaning any pawn on the a- or h-files, a ''{{chessgloss|knight's pawn}}'' (on the b- or g-files), a ''{{chessgloss|bishop's pawn}}'' (on the c- or f-files), a ''{{chessgloss|queen's pawn}}'' (on the d-file), a ''{{chessgloss|king's pawn}}'' (on the e-file), and a ''{{chessgloss|central pawn}}'' (on the d- or e-files).

==Placement and movement==
Unlike the other pieces, pawns cannot move backwards. Normally a pawn moves by advancing a single square, but the first time a pawn moves, it has the option of advancing two squares. Pawns may not use the initial two-square advance to jump over an occupied square, or to capture. Any piece immediately in front of a pawn, friend or foe, blocks its advance. In the second diagram, the pawn on c4 can move to c5; the pawn on e2 can move to either e3 or e4.

===Capturing===

Unlike other pieces, the pawn does not capture in the same direction that it moves. A pawn captures diagonally forward one square to the left or right (see diagram).

Another unusual rule is the ''[[en passant]]'' capture. It can occur after a pawn advances two squares using its initial two-step move option, and the square passed over is attacked by an enemy pawn. The enemy pawn is entitled to capture the moved pawn &quot;in passing&quot;&amp;nbsp;– as if it had advanced only one square. The capturing pawn moves to the square over which the moved pawn passed (see diagram), and the moved pawn is removed from the board. The option to capture the moved pawn ''en passant'' must be exercised on the move immediately following the double-step pawn advance, or it is lost for the remainder of the game.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld (1996), pp. 124–25. ''en passant''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''En passant'' was added in the 15th century to compensate for the then newly added two-square initial move rule (Hooper &amp; Whyld 1992:124). Without ''en passant'', a pawn on its initial square could safely bypass a square controlled by an advanced enemy pawn. ''En passant'' is the only capture in chess in which the capturing piece does not replace the captured piece on the same square.

===Promotion===
{{main article|Promotion (chess)}}
A pawn that advances all the way to the opposite side of the board (the opposing player's first rank) is ''[[Promotion (chess)|promoted]]'' to another piece of that player's choice: a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. The pawn is immediately (before the opponent's next move) replaced by the new piece. Since it is uncommon for a piece other than a queen to be chosen, promotion is often called &quot;queening&quot;. When some other piece is chosen it is known as ''[[underpromotion]]''. The piece most often selected for underpromotion is a [[knight (chess)|knight]], used to execute a [[checkmate]] or a [[Fork (chess)|fork]] to gain a significant net increase in material. Underpromotion is also used in situations where promoting to a queen would give immediate [[stalemate]]. The choice of promotion is not limited to pieces that have been captured; thus a player could in theory have as many as ten knights, ten bishops, ten rooks or nine queens on the board simultaneously. While this extreme would almost never occur in practice, in game 11 of their 1927 world championship match, [[José Raúl Capablanca]] and [[Alexander Alekhine]] each had two queens in play from move 65 through move 66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1270221 |title=Capablanca vs. Alekhine, 1927, game 11 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some finer sets do include an extra queen of each color, most standard chess sets do not come with additional pieces, so the physical piece used to replace a promoted pawn on the board is usually one that was previously captured. In informal games, when the correct piece is not available, a second queen is often indicated by inverting a previously captured rook, or placing two pawns on the same square. In tournament games however this is not acceptable, and may result in the arbiter ruling that the upturned piece is, in fact, a rook.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Klein, [https://www.chess.com/news/view/controversial-finish-to-canadian-chess-championship-5047 Controversial Finish To Canadian Championship -- Update], chess.com, 12 July, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
{{main article|Pawn structure}}
The ''[[pawn structure]]'', the configuration of pawns on the chessboard, mostly determines the strategic flavor of a game. While other pieces can usually be moved to more favorable positions if they are temporarily badly placed, a poorly positioned pawn is limited in its movement and often cannot be so relocated.

|Locked pawn chains in the [[French Defense]] after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5
}}
Because pawns capture diagonally and can be blocked from moving straight forward, opposing pawns can become locked in diagonal {{chessgloss|pawn chains}} of two or more pawns of each color, where each player controls squares of one color. In the diagram, Black and White have locked their d- and e-pawns.

Here, White has a long-term {{chessgloss|space}} advantage. White will have an easier time than Black in finding good squares for their pieces, particularly with an eye to the {{chessgloss|kingside}}. Black, in contrast, suffers from a {{chessgloss|bad bishop}} on c8, which is prevented by the black pawns from finding a good square or helping out on the kingside. On the other hand, White's central pawns are somewhat {{chessgloss|overextended}} and vulnerable to attack. Black can undermine the white pawn chain with an immediate ...c5 and perhaps a later ...f6.

Pawns on adjacent files can support each other in attack and defense. A pawn which has no friendly pawns in adjacent files is an ''[[isolated pawn]]''. The square in front of an isolated pawn may become an enduring weakness. Any piece placed directly in front not only blocks the advance of that pawn, but cannot be driven away by other pawns.

In the diagram, Black has an isolated pawn on d5. If all the pieces except the kings and pawns were removed, the weakness of that pawn might prove fatal to Black in the [[Chess endgame|endgame]]. In the [[Chess middlegame|middlegame]], however, Black has slightly more freedom of movement than White, and may be able to trade off the isolated pawn before an endgame ensues.

A pawn which cannot be blocked or captured by enemy pawns in its advance to promotion is a ''[[passed pawn]]''. In the diagram, White has a ''protected'' passed pawn on c5 and Black has an ''outside'' passed pawn on h5. Because endgames are often won by the player who can promote a pawn first, having a passed pawn in an endgame can be decisive&amp;nbsp;– especially a protected passed pawn (a passed pawn that is protected by a pawn). In this vein, a pawn ''majority'', a greater number of pawns belonging to one player on one side of the chessboard, is strategically important because it can often be converted into a passed pawn.

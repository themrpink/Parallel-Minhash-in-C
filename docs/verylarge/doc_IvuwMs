== Career ==
[[File:Ashley Judd 2012.jpg|thumb|Judd at an ABC ''[[Missing (2012 TV series)|Missing]]'' event at The Paley Center in April 2012]]
Starting in 1991, Judd appeared as [[Ensign (Star Trek)|Ensign]] [[Robin Lefler]], a [[Starfleet]] officer, in two  episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', &quot;[[Darmok]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Game (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Game]]&quot;. From 1991 to 1994, she had a recurring role as Reed, the daughter of Alex ([[Swoosie Kurtz]]), on the NBC drama ''[[Sisters (U.S. TV series)|Sisters]]''.  

She made her feature film debut with a small role in 1992's ''[[Kuffs]]''.  In 1993, she fought for and was cast in her first starring role playing the title character in [[Victor Nuñez]]'s [[Sundance Film Festival]] Grand Jury Prize dramatic winner ''[[Ruby in Paradise]]''. Convinced that this role would shape the rest of her career, Judd was extremely nervous for the audition, nearly getting into a car accident en route. &quot;From the first three sentences, I knew it was written for me&quot;, she told the ''San Jose Mercury News''.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, Glenn. San Jose Mercury News, November 8, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; She received rave reviews playing Ruby Lee Gissing, a young woman trying to make a new life for herself, and it was this performance that would launch her career as an actress. Nuñez told author James L. Dickerson that the resonance of the character was Judd's creation: &quot;The resonance, those moments, was not contrived. It was just a matter of creating the scene and trusting that it was worth telling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, James L. Ashley Judd:Crying on the Inside, Schirmer Trade Books, 2002, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Oliver Stone]], who had seen her in Nuñez's film, cast Judd in ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'', but her scenes were later cut from the version of the film released theatrically. The following year, she gained further critical acclaim for her role as [[Harvey Keitel]]'s estranged daughter in [[Wayne Wang]]'s ''[[Smoke (film)|Smoke]]'' and also as [[Val Kilmer]]'s wife in [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]'s ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]''. That same year she also played the role of Callie in [[Philip Ridley]]'s dark, adult fairy tale, ''[[The Passion of Darkly Noon]]''. In 1996, she co-starred with [[Mira Sorvino]] as [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Norma Jean and Marilyn]]'', where she recreated the photo shoot for the centerfold for the first issue of ''[[Playboy]]''. The same year she had a supporting role in the court room thriller film ''[[A Time to Kill (1996 film)|A Time to Kill]]'' (1996) which received positive reviews and was a major box office success. By the end of the 1990s, Judd had managed to achieve significant fame and success as a leading actress, after leading roles in several thrillers that performed well at the box office, including ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]]'' in 1997 and 1999's ''[[Double Jeopardy (1999 film)|Double Jeopardy]]''.

In early 2000s she starred in ''[[Where the Heart Is (2000 film)|Where the Heart Is]]'' (2000), ''[[Someone Like You (film)|Someone Like You]]'' (2001), and ''[[High Crimes]]'' (2002).

A disagreement between Judd and Indy race car driver [[Milka Duno]] took place during the 2007 [[2007 IndyCar Series season|IndyCar]] season. After the final race, she stated to the media: &quot;I know this is not very sportsmanlike, but they've got to get the 23 car (Duno) off the track. It's very dangerous. I'm tired of holding my tongue. She shouldn't be out there. When a car is 10 miles [an hour] off the pace, it's not appropriate to be racing.

===Sexual assault===
In October 2015, Judd told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that she had been sexually harassed by a studio mogul, but did not name the person. In October 2017, she said the person was [[Harvey Weinstein]], co-founder of [[Miramax]], and said that the sexual harassment occurred during the filming of ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Niemietz | first=Brian |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/harvey-weinstein-accused-sexual-harassment-ashley-judd-article-1.3543520 |title=Harvey Weinstein admits his behavior has caused women pain after Ashley Judd, others accuse him of harassment |work=[[New York Daily News]] |access-date=October 5, 2017 |date=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Women in the World]] summit in April 2019, while addressing [[Fetal heartbeat bill#Georgia|Georgia's fetal heartbeat bill]] passed in March 2019, Judd discussed being raped three times, one resulting in conception. She stated, &quot;As everyone knows, and I'm very open about it, I'm a three-time rape survivor,&quot; Judd said. &quot;One of the times that I was raped there was conception and I'm very thankful I was able to access safe and legal abortion. Because the rapist, who is a Kentuckian, as am I, and I reside in Tennessee, has paternity rights in Kentucky and Tennessee. I would've had to co-parent with my rapist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;2019-04-13_News&quot;&gt;[https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/ashley-judd-i-would-have-had-to-coparent-with-my-rapist/news-story/98c6ee1bb2735e4ae34e679c897847ee Ashley Judd: 'I would have had to co-parent with my rapist'], Megan Palin, News.com.au, 2019-04-13&lt;/ref&gt;

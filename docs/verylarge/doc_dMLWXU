Some culinary specialties from Bastia and its region:
* ''Sardines au brocciu'': fresh sardines stuffed with Brocciu cheese made from sheep milk;
* ''Baccalà'': from [[cod]]; this dish was long considered the dish of the poor in Corsica because its price was affordable and it kept easily due to being heavily salted.

{{Green politics sidebar|Related}}
The '''environmental movement''' (sometimes referred to as the '''ecology movement'''), also including [[conservation movement|conservation]] and [[green politics]], is a diverse philosophical, social, and [[political movement]] for addressing [[environmental issues]]. [[Environmentalist]]s advocate the [[sustainable]] management of resources and [[stewardship]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] through changes in public policy and [[Behavior change (individual)|individual behavior.]] In its recognition of humanity as a participant in (not enemy of) [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]], the movement is centered on [[ecology]], [[health]], and [[human rights]].

The environmental movement is an international movement, represented by a range of organizations, from enterprises to [[grassroots]] and varies from country to country. Due to its large membership, varying and strong beliefs, and occasionally speculative nature, the environmental movement is not always united in its goals. The movement also encompasses some other movements with a more specific focus, such as the [[climate movement]]. At its broadest, the movement includes private citizens, professionals, [[Religion and environmentalism|religious devotees]], politicians, scientists, [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit organizations]], and individual advocates.

==History==

===Early awareness===
[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|Levels of air pollution rose during the [[Industrial Revolution]], sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century]]
Early interest in the environment was a feature of the [[Romantic movement]] in the early 19th century. The poet [[William Wordsworth]] had travelled extensively in the [[Lake District]] and wrote that it is a &quot;sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wordsworth|first=William|authorlink=William Wordsworth|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_idlAAAAAYAAJ|quote=sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy.|title=A guide through the district of the lakes in the north of England with a description of the scenery, &amp;c. for the use of tourists and residents|edition=5th|location=Kendal, England|publisher=Hudson and Nicholson|year=1835|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_idlAAAAAYAAJ/page/n122 88]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the environmental movement lay in response to increasing levels of [[smoke]] [[pollution]] in the [[atmosphere]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [[history of coal mining|coal consumption]] gave rise to an unprecedented level of [[air pollution]] in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial [[chemical]] discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donora&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/ |title=History of the Clean Air Act |accessdate=2006-02-14 |first=James R. |last=Fleming |author2=Bethany R. Knorr |publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under increasing political pressure from the urban middle-class, the first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's [[Alkali Acts]], passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ([[gaseous]] [[hydrochloric acid]]) given off by the [[Leblanc process]], used to produce [[soda ash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/07/embark-essay-climate-change-pollution-revkin/|title=Climate Change First Became News 30 Years Ago. Why Haven't We Fixed It?|date=2018-06-21|website=Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation movement===
{{Main|Conservation movement}}
[[File:Sir William Schlich07.jpg|thumb|Students from the forestry school at [[Oxford]], on a visit to the forests of Saxony in the year 1892]]
The modern [[conservation movement]] was first manifested in the forests of India, with the practical application of scientific conservation principles. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that the human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many [[Epidemiology|medico-topographical]] reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the [[Institutionalisation|institutionalization]] of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stebbing |first=E.P |author-link=Edward Percy Stebbing |year=1922 |title=The Forests of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cAHAQAAIAAJ |volume=1 |pages=72–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation programme based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|first=Greg|last=Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=9781139434607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the government under [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation programme in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well as the [[United States]]. In 1860, the Department banned the use of [[shifting cultivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=5 November 2007|work=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Francis Cleghorn|Hugh Cleghorn]]'s 1861 manual, ''The forests and gardens of South India'', became the definitive work on the subject and was widely used by forest assistants in the subcontinent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cleghorn&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

[[Dietrich Brandis]] joined the British service in 1856 as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern [[Myanmar|Burma]]. During that time Burma's [[teak]] forests were controlled by militant [[Karen people|Karen]] tribals. He introduced the &quot;taungya&quot; system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=KFS |year=1968 |title=Agro-silviculture (the taungya system) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=44smPw8a594C |volume=Bulletin no. 1 |publisher=University of Ibadan / Dept. of Forestry }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Karen villagers provided labour for clearing, planting, and weeding teak plantations. He formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions. The Imperial Forestry School at [[Dehradun]] was founded by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weil |first1=Benjamin |year=2006 |title=Conservation, Exploitation, and Cultural Change in the Indian Forest Service, 1875–1927 |jstor=3986234 |journal=Environmental History |volume=11| issue =  2 |pages=319–343 |doi=10.1093/envhis/11.2.319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gadgil |first1=Madhav |author-link1=Madhav Gadgil |last2=Guha |first2=Ramachandra |author-link2=Ramachandra Guha |year=1993 |title=This Fissured Land: An Ecological History of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jmr9n7aoRR4C |isbn=9780520082960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of environmental protection societies===
The late 19th century saw the formation of the first wildlife conservation societies.
The zoologist [[Alfred Newton]] published a series of investigations into the ''Desirability of establishing a 'Close-time' for the preservation of indigenous animals'' between 1872 and 1903. His advocacy for legislation to protect animals from hunting during the mating season led to the formation of the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|Plumage League]] (later the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) in 1889.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/milestones.asp |title=Milestones  |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society acted as a [[advocacy group|protest group]] campaigning against the use of [[great crested grebe]] and [[black-legged kittiwake|kittiwake]] skins and feathers in [[fur clothing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes,&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;/&gt; and influenced the passage of the [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act]] in 1869 as the first nature protection law in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author=G.

For most of the century from 1850 to 1950, however, the primary environmental cause was the mitigation of air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke.

[[File:John Ruskin - Portrait - Project Gutenberg eText 17774.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[John Ruskin]] an influential thinker who articulated the Romantic ideal of environmental protection and conservation]]
Systematic and general efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century; it grew out of the amenity movement in Britain in the 1870s, which was a reaction to [[industrialization]], the growth of cities, and worsening air and [[water pollution]]. Starting with the formation of the [[Commons Preservation Society]] in 1865, the movement championed rural preservation against the encroachments of industrialisation. [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Robert Hunter]], solicitor for the society, worked with [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], [[Octavia Hill]], and [[John Ruskin]] to lead a successful campaign to prevent the construction of railways to carry slate from the quarries, which would have ruined the unspoilt valleys of [[Newlands Valley|Newlands]] and [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]]. This success led to the formation of the Lake District Defence Society (later to become The Friends of the Lake District).&lt;ref name=vc&gt;[http://www.visitcumbria.com/rawnsley.htm &quot;Canon Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806070246/http://www.visitcumbria.com/rawnsley.htm |date=6 August 2014 }}, Visitcumbria.com. Retrieved 17 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley agreed to set up a national body to coordinate environmental conservation efforts across the country; the &quot;[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]&quot; was formally inaugurated in 1894.&lt;ref name=t94&gt;&quot;A Proposed National Trust&quot;, ''The Times'', 17 July 1894, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation obtained secure footing through the 1907 National Trust Bill, which gave the trust the status of a statutory corporation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Parliamentary Committees&quot;, ''The Times'', 26 July 1907. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and the bill was passed in August 1907.&lt;ref name=act&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/servlet/file/store5/item740098/version1/National%20Trust%20Acts%201907-1971%20post%20Order%202005.pdf &quot;An Act to incorporate and confer powers upon the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602185018/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/servlet/file/store5/item740098/version1/National%20Trust%20Acts%201907-1971%20post%20Order%202005.pdf |date=2 June 2012 }}, The National Trust.

[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|upright|Original title page of ''[[Walden]]'' by [[Henry David Thoreau]]]]

An early &quot;Back-to-Nature&quot; movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as [[John Ruskin]], [[William Morris]], and [[Edward Carpenter]], who were all against [[consumerism]], [[pollution]] and other activities that were harmful to the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Peter C. (1988). ''Early Green Politics'', Brighton, Harvester Press, pgs. 15–19, and [[Derek Wall|Wall, Derek]], (1994) ''Green History: A Reader.'' London, Routledge, pgs. 9–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns, where sanitation was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical [[Utopia]] and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a ''small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful. We will have no steam engines upon it . . . we will have plenty of flowers and vegetables . . . we will have some music and poetry; the children will learn to dance to it and sing it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/backtolandpastor00mars|url-access=registration|title=Back to the Land: The Pastoral Impulse in England, 1880–1914|first=Jan|last=Marsh|year=1982|publisher=Quartet Books|isbn=9780704322769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical ventures in the establishment of small cooperative farms were even attempted and old rural traditions, without the &quot;taint of manufacture or the canker of artificiality&quot;, were enthusiastically revived, including the [[Morris dance]] and the [[maypole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1983/1215/121523.html|title='Back to nature' movement nothing new – dates back to 1880|journal=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2012-12-17|date=15 December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement in the [[United States]] began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as [[John Muir]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book ''[[Walden]]'', which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in [[Yosemite Valley]] and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form [[Yosemite National Park]] and went on to set up the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism. However, the early movement in the U.S. developed with a contradiction; preservationists like [[John Muir]] wanted land and nature set aside for its own sake, and conservationists, such as [[Gifford Pinchot]] (appointed as the first Chief of the [[US Forest Service]] from 1905 to 1910), wanted to manage natural resources for human use.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were beginning to be made to save the wildlife, particularly the [[American bison]]. The death of the last [[passenger pigeon]] as well as the endangerment of the American bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and popularize their concerns. In 1916, the [[National Park Service]] was founded by U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=National Parks 101|url=https://www.travelchannel.com/interests/national-parks/articles/national-parks-101|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Travel Channel|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneers of the movement called for more efficient and professional management of natural resources. They fought for reform because they believed the destruction of forests, fertile soil, minerals, wildlife, and water resources would lead to the downfall of society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Culture Wars&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Roger|title=Culture wars: an encyclopedia of issues, viewpoints, and voices|url=https://archive.org/details/culturewarsencyc00chap|url-access=limited|year=2010|publisher=M.E.

The U.S movement began to take off after [[World War II]], as people began to recognize the costs of environmental negligence, disease, and the expansion of air and water pollution through the occurrence of several environmental disasters that occurred post-World War II. [[Aldo Leopold]] wrote &quot;[[A Sand County Almanac]]&quot; in the 1940s. He believed in a land ethic that recognized that maintaining the &quot;beauty, integrity, and health of natural systems&quot; as a moral and ethical imperative.

Another major literary force in the promotion of the environmental movement was [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' about declining bird populations due to [[DDT]], an insecticide, pollutant, and man's attempts to control nature through the use of synthetic substances. Her core message for her readers was to identify the complex and fragile ecosystem and the threats facing the population. In 1958, Carson started to work on her last book, with an idea that nature needs human protection. Her influence was radioactive fallout, smog, food additives, and pesticide use. Carson's main focus was on pesticides, which led her to identify nature as fragile and the use of technology dangerous to humans and other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed: 1945 to the present|last=Hunt|first=Michael H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780199371020|location=New York, New York|pages=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1969 and continuing into the 1970s, Illinois-based environmental activist [[James F. Phillips]] engaged in numerous covert anti-pollution campaigns using the pseudonym &quot;the Fox.&quot; His activities included plugging illegal sewage outfall pipes and dumping toxic wastewater produced by a [[U.S. Steel|US Steel]] factory inside the company's Chicago corporate office. Phillips' &quot;ecotage&quot; campaigns attracted considerable media attention and subsequently inspired other direct action protests against environmental destruction.

The first [[Earth Day]] was celebrated on 22 April 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Editors|first=History com|title=The first Earth Day|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-first-earth-day|access-date=2020-06-10|website=HISTORY|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder, former Wisconsin Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]], was inspired to create this day of environmental education and awareness after seeing the oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969. [[Greenpeace]] was created in 1971 as an organization that believed that political advocacy and legislation were ineffective or inefficient solutions and supported non-violent action. 1980 saw the creation of [[Earth First!]], a group with an [[Ecocentrism|ecocentric]] view of the world – believing in equality between the rights of humans to flourish, the rights of all other species to flourish and the rights of life-sustaining systems to flourish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Culture Wars&quot; /&gt;

In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, several events illustrated the magnitude of environmental damage caused by humans. In 1954, a [[hydrogen bomb]] test at [[Bikini Atoll]] exposed the 23-man crew of the Japanese fishing vessel ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon 5]]'' to radioactive fallout. The incident is known as [[Castle Bravo]], the largest thermonuclear device ever detonated by the United States and the first in a series of high-yield thermonuclear weapon design tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowberry|first=Ariana|date=27 February 2014|title=Castle Bravo: The Largest U.S. Nuclear Explosion|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/02/27/castle-bravo-the-largest-u-s-nuclear-explosion/|access-date=2020-06-10|website=Brookings|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the oil tanker {{SS|Torrey Canyon||2}} ran aground off the coast of [[Cornwall]], and in 1969 oil spilled from an offshore well in California's [[Santa Barbara Channel]]. In 1971, the conclusion of a lawsuit in [[Japan]] drew international attention to the effects of decades of [[mercury poisoning]] on the people of [[Minamata]].&lt;ref&gt;Most of the information in this section comes from [[John McCormick (political scientist)|John McCormick]], ''The Global Environmental Movement'', London: John Wiley, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, emerging scientific research drew new attention to existing and hypothetical threats to the environment and humanity. Among them were [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], whose book ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' (1968) revived [[Thomas Malthus|Malthusian]] concerns about the impact of exponential population growth. Biologist [[Barry Commoner]] generated a debate about growth, affluence and &quot;flawed technology.&quot; Additionally, an association of scientists and political leaders known as the [[Club of Rome]] published their report ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972, and drew attention to the growing pressure on natural resources from human activities.

Meanwhile, technological accomplishments such as [[nuclear proliferation]] and photos of the [[Earth]] from [[outer space]] provided both new insights and new reasons for concern over Earth's seemingly small and unique place in the universe.

In 1972, the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] was held in [[Stockholm]], and for the first time united the representatives of multiple governments in discussion relating to the state of the global environment. This conference led directly to the creation of government environmental agencies and the [[UN Environment Program]].

By the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence.  Although it lacked a single co-ordinating organization the [[anti-nuclear movement]]'s efforts gained a great deal of attention, especially in the [[United Kingdom]] and United States.&lt;ref name=eleven&gt;Walker, J. Samuel (2004).

Since the 1970s, public awareness, [[environmental science]]s, [[ecology]], and technology have advanced to include modern focus points like [[ozone]] depletion, [[global warming|global climate change]], [[acid rain]], [[mutation breeding]], [[genetically modified crops]] and [[genetically modified livestock]]. With mutation breeding, crop cultivars were created by exposing seeds to chemicals or radiation. Many of these cultivars are still being used today. Genetically modified plants and animals are said by some environmentalists to be inherently bad because they are unnatural. Others point out the possible benefits of GM crops such as water conservation through corn modified to be less &quot;thirsty&quot; and decreased pesticide use through insect – resistant crops. They also point out that some genetically modified livestock have accelerated growth which means there are shorter production cycles which again results in a more efficient use of feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-31604233|title=Is the world ready for GM animals?|first=Paul|last=Rincon|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=16 August 2018|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides genetically modified crops and livestock, [[synthetic biology]] is also on the rise and environmentalists argue that these also contain risks, if these organisms were ever to end up in nature. This, as unlike with genetically modified organisms, synthetic biology even uses [[base pairs]] that do not exist in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/synthetic_biology_biodiversity_FB15_en.pdf|title=FUTURE BRIEF : Synthetic biology and biodiversity|date=September 2016|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Main|Environmental movement in the United States}}
Beginning in the [[conservation movement]] at the beginning of the 20th century, the contemporary environmental movement's roots can be traced back to [[Murray Bookchin]]'s ''[[Our Synthetic Environment]]'', [[Paul R. Ehrlich]]'s [[The Population Bomb]], and [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]''. American environmentalists have campaigned against [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear power]] in the 1960s and 1970s, [[acid rain]] in the 1980s, [[ozone depletion]] and [[deforestation]] in the 1990s, and most recently [[climate change]] and [[global warming]].

The United States passed many pieces of environmental legislation in the 1970s, such as the [[Clean Water Act]], the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Endangered Species Act]], and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]. These remain as the foundations for current environmental standards.

==Latin America==

After the [[International Environmental Conference in Stockholm]] in 1972 Latin American officials returned with a high hope of growth and protection of the fairly untouched natural resources. Governments spent millions of dollars, and created departments and pollution standards. However, the outcomes have not always been what officials had initially hoped. Activists blame this on growing urban populations and industrial growth. Many Latin American countries have had a large inflow of immigrants that are living in substandard housing. Enforcement of the pollution standards is lax and penalties are minimal; in Venezuela, the largest penalty for violating an environmental law is 50,000 [[Venezuelan bolívar|bolivar]] fine ($3,400) and 3 days in jail. In the 1970s or 1980s, many Latin American countries were transitioning from military dictatorships to democratic governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latin America&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Figdor|first=Carrie|title=Latin America's Environmental Movement Seen as Well-Meaning but Inadequate|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-24/news/mn-10121_1_latin-america|accessdate=20 February 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=24 July 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Brazil came under scrutiny with the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil has a history of little environmental awareness. It has the highest [[biodiversity]] in the world and also the highest amount of habitat destruction. One-third of the world's forests lie in Brazil, and they have the largest river, [[Amazon River|The Amazon]], and the largest rainforest, the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. People have raised funds to create state parks and increase the consciousness of people who have destroyed forests and polluted waterways. They have several organizations that have fronted the environmental movement. The Blue Wave Foundation was created in 1989 and has partnered with advertising companies to promote national education campaigns to keep Brazil's beaches clean. Funatura was created in 1986 and is a wildlife sanctuary program. [[Pro-Natura International]] is a private environmental organization created in 1986.&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooke|first=Elizabeth Heilman|title=As Forests Fall, Environmental Movement Rises in Brazil|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/02/news/as-forests-fall-environmental-movement-rises-in-brazil.html|accessdate=20 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 June 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

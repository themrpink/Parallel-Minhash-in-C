Using vacuum pump oil as the working fluid in a barometer has led to the creation of the new &quot;World's Tallest Barometer&quot; in February 2013. The barometer at Portland State University (PSU) uses doubly distilled vacuum pump oil and has a nominal height of about 12.4&amp;nbsp;m for the oil column height; expected excursions are in the range of ±0.4&amp;nbsp;m over the course of a year. Vacuum pump oil has very low vapour pressure and it is available in a range of densities; the lowest density vacuum oil was chosen for the PSU barometer to maximize the oil column height.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, Stuart (February 10, 2013) [http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2013/02/large_barometer_at_portland_st.html Large barometer at Portland State University could be the tallest in the world]. oregonlive.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aneroid barometers ===
[[File:Modern Aneroid Barometer.jpg|thumb|Aneroid barometer]]

An aneroid barometer is an [[Measuring instrument|instrument]] used for measuring [[pressure]] as a method that does not involve [[liquid]]. Invented in 1844 by French scientist [[Lucien Vidi]],&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite book|author1=Figuier, Louis |author2=Gautier, Émile |title=L'Année scientifique et industrielle|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Cus0AAAAMAAJ|year=1867|publisher=L. Hachette et cie.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Cus0AAAAMAAJ/page/n495 485]–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; the aneroid barometer uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell (capsule), which is made from an [[alloy]] of [[beryllium]] and [[copper]]. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract.  This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed on the face of the aneroid barometer.  Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so a change can be seen. This type of barometer is common in homes and in [[recreational boat]]s. It is also used in [[meteorology]], mostly in [[barograph]]s and as a pressure instrument in [[radiosonde]]s.

==== Barographs ====

{{Main article|Barograph}}

A barograph is a recording aneroid barometer where the changes in atmospheric pressure are recorded on a paper chart.

The principle of the barograph is same as that of the aneroid barometer. Whereas the barometer displays the pressure on a dial, the barograph uses the small movements of the box to transmit by a system of levers to a recording arm that has at its extreme end either a scribe or a pen. A scribe records on smoked foil while a pen records on paper using ink, held in a nib. The recording material is mounted on a cylindrical drum which is rotated slowly by a clock. Commonly, the drum makes one revolution per day, per week, or per month and the rotation rate can often be selected by the user.

[[Microelectromechanical systems]] (or MEMS) barometers are extremely small devices between 1 and 100 micrometres in size (0.001 to 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm). They are created via [[photolithography]] or [[photochemical machining]].

There are many other more unusual types of barometer. From variations on the storm barometer, such as the Collins Patent Table Barometer, to more traditional-looking designs such as Hooke's Otheometer and the Ross Sympiesometer. Some, such as the Shark Oil barometer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barometerworld.co.uk/articles.htm#sharkoil Shark Oil Barometer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720091837/http://www.barometerworld.co.uk/articles.htm#sharkoil |date=July 20, 2011 }} Barometer World.&lt;/ref&gt; work only in a certain temperature range, achieved in warmer climates.

Barometric pressure and the pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) have been used in weather forecasting since the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wbarocx.htm Understanding air pressure.] ''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; When used in combination with wind observations, reasonably accurate short-term forecasts can be made.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wfbarrow.htm Using winds and a barometer to make forecasts.] ''USA Today'' (17 May 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneous barometric readings from across a network of weather stations allow maps of air pressure to be produced, which were the first form of the modern [[weather map]] when created in the 19th century.

If the pressure drop is rapid, a [[Low pressure area|low pressure system]] is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. [[High pressure area|Rapid pressure rises]], such as in the wake of a [[cold front]], are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/eyes/barometer3.htm Applying The Barometer To Weather Watching.] Weather Doctor.&lt;/ref&gt;

With falling air pressure, gases trapped within the coal in deep mines can escape more freely. Thus low pressure increases the risk of [[firedamp]] accumulating. Collieries therefore keep track of the pressure. In the case of the [[Trimdon Grange#Colliery Disaster|Trimdon Grange colliery disaster]] of 1882 the mines inspector drew attention to the records and in the report stated &quot;the conditions of atmosphere and temperature may be taken to have reached a dangerous point&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.dmm.org.uk/reports/3319-01.htm | title = Report on the Explosion which occurred at the Trimdon Grange Colliery on the 16th February 1882 | accessdate = 23 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aneroid barometers are used in [[scuba diving]]. A [[Diving regulator#Submersible pressure gauge (SPG)|submersible pressure gauge]] is used to keep track of the contents of the diver's air tank. Another gauge is used to measure the hydrostatic pressure, usually expressed as a depth of sea water.  Either or both gauges may be replaced with electronic variants or a dive computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Recreational Diving|date=1990|publisher=[[Professional Association of Diving Instructors]]|location=Santa Ana, CA, USA|isbn=978-1-878663-02-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre00prof/page/3 3–96–3–99]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre00prof/page/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compensations ==

=== Temperature ===

The density of mercury will change with increase or decrease in temperature, so a reading must be adjusted for the temperature of the instrument. For this purpose a mercury [[thermometer]] is usually mounted on the instrument. Temperature compensation of an aneroid barometer is accomplished by including a bi-metal element in the mechanical linkages.  Aneroid barometers sold for domestic use typically have no compensation under the assumption that they will be used within a controlled room temperature range.

=== Altitude ===
[[File:NWS Key West office barometer as Hurricane Irma approached.jpg|thumb|A digital barometer with altimeter setting (for correction) displayed]]
As the air pressure decreases at [[altitude]]s above sea level (and increases below sea level) the uncorrected reading of the barometer will depend on its location. The reading is then adjusted to an equivalent sea-level pressure for purposes of reporting. For example, if a barometer located at sea level and under fair weather conditions is moved to an altitude of 1,000 feet (305&amp;nbsp;m), about 1 inch of mercury (~35 hPa) must be added on to the reading. The barometer readings at the two locations should be the same if there are negligible changes in time, horizontal distance, and temperature. If this were not done, there would be a false indication of an approaching storm at the higher elevation.

Aneroid barometers have a mechanical adjustment that allows the equivalent sea level pressure to be read directly and without further adjustment if the instrument is not moved to a different altitude. Setting an aneroid barometer is similar to resetting an [[Clock face|analog clock]] that is not at the correct time. Its dial is rotated so that the current atmospheric pressure from a known accurate and nearby barometer (such as the local [[weather station]]) is displayed. No calculation is needed, as the source barometer reading has already been converted to equivalent sea-level pressure, and this is transferred to the barometer being set—regardless of its altitude. Though somewhat rare, a few aneroid barometers intended for monitoring the weather are calibrated to manually adjust for altitude. In this case, knowing ''either'' the altitude or the current atmospheric pressure would be sufficient for future accurate readings.

The table below shows examples for three locations in the city of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Note the corrected barometer readings are identical, and based on equivalent sea-level pressure. (Assume a temperature of 15&amp;nbsp;°C.)

In 1787, during a scientific expedition on [[Mont Blanc]], [[Horace Bénédict de Saussure|De Saussure]] undertook research and executed physical experiments on the [[Water#States|boiling point of water]] at different heights. He calculated the height at each of his experiments by measuring how long it took an alcohol burner to boil an amount of water, and by these means he determined the height of the mountain to be 4775 metres. (This later turned out to be 32 metres less than the actual height of 4807 metres). For these experiments De Saussure brought specific scientific equipment, such as a barometer and [[thermometer]]. His calculated boiling temperature of water at the top of the mountain was fairly accurate, only off by 0.1 kelvin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicspure.blogspot.com/2020/02/what-is-kelvin-scale-of-temperature.html|title=Kelvin scale in depth|access-date=12 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on his findings, the [[altimeter]] could be developed as a specific application of the barometer. In the mid-19th century, this method was used by explorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M. N. |last1=Berberan-Santos |first2=E.

==Equation==
When atmospheric pressure is measured by a barometer, the pressure is also referred to as the &quot;barometric pressure&quot;. Assume a barometer with a cross-sectional area ''A'', a height ''h'', filled with mercury from the bottom at Point B to the top at Point C. The pressure at the bottom of the barometer, Point B, is equal to the atmospheric pressure. The pressure at the very top, Point C, can be taken as zero because there is only mercury vapour above this point and its pressure is very low relative to the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, one can find the atmospheric pressure using the barometer and this equation:&lt;ref&gt;Cengal, Yunus A. and Boles, Michael A. (2014) ''Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach''. McGraw-Hill Education. {{ISBN|978-0073398174}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|this equation cannot work across the entire range of pressures shown in the table - needs clarification|date=June 2020}}

:P&lt;sub&gt;atm&lt;/sub&gt; = ρgh

where ρ is the density of mercury, g is the gravitational acceleration, and h is the height of the mercury column above the free surface area. The physical dimensions (length of tube and cross-sectional area of the tube) of the barometer itself have no effect on the height of the fluid column in the tube.

In thermodynamic calculations, a commonly used pressure unit is the &quot;standard atmosphere&quot;. This is the pressure resulting from a column of mercury of 760&amp;nbsp;mm in height at 0&amp;nbsp;°C. For the density of mercury, use ρ&lt;sub&gt;Hg&lt;/sub&gt; = 13,595&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and for gravitational acceleration use g = 9.807&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

If water were used (instead of mercury) to meet the standard atmospheric pressure, a water column of roughly 10.3&amp;nbsp;m (33.8&amp;nbsp;ft) would be needed.

'''Biodegradation''' is the breakdown of [[organic matter]] by [[microorganism]]s, such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]].{{efn| The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] defines biodegradation as &quot;degradation caused by enzymatic process resulting from the action of cells&quot; and notes that the definition is &quot;modified to exclude abiotic enzymatic processes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vert M, Doi Y, Hellwich KH, Hess M, Hodge P, Kubisa P, Rinaudo M, Schué F | title=Terminology for biorelated polymers and applications (IUPAC Recommendations 2012) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |year=2012 |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=377–410 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-12-04 | s2cid=98107080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Biodegradation| vauthors = Focht DD | journal = AccessScience |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.422025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
The process of biodegradation can be divided into three stages: biodeterioration, biofragmentation, and [[assimilation (biology)|assimilation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Biodeterioration is sometimes described as a surface-level degradation that modifies the mechanical, physical and chemical properties of the material. This stage occurs when the material is exposed to [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] factors in the outdoor environment and allows for further degradation by weakening the material's structure. Some abiotic factors that influence these initial changes are compression (mechanical), light, temperature and chemicals in the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucas N, Bienaime C, Belloy C, Queneudec M, Silvestre F, Nava-Saucedo JE | title = Polymer biodegradation: mechanisms and estimation techniques | journal = Chemosphere | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 429–42 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18723204 | doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.06.064 | bibcode = 2008Chmsp..73..429L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;While biodeterioration typically occurs as the first stage of biodegradation, it can in some cases be parallel to biofragmentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Muller|first=Rolf-Joachim | editor-first =  Alexander | editor-last = Steinbüchel | name-list-style = vanc | chapter = Biodegradability of Polymers: Regulations and Methods for Testing |title=Biopolymers |publisher=Wiley-VCH |isbn=978-3-527-30290-1 | chapter-url = https://application.wiley-vch.de/books/biopoly/pdf_v10/vol10_19.pdf | doi = 10.1002/3527600035.bpola012 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hueck,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hueck|first=Hans|date=January 1966|title=The biodeterioration of materials as part of hylobiology|journal=Material und Organismen|volume=1|pages=5–34|via=ISSN 00255270}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, defined Biodeterioration as the undesirable action of living organisms on Man's materials, involving such things as breakdown of stone facades of buildings,&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Biodeterioration|last=Allsopp|first=Dennis|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780511617065|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; corrosion of metals by microorganisms or merely the esthetic changes induced on man-made structures by the growth of living organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

Biofragmentation of a [[polymer]] is the [[lytic]] process in which bonds within a polymer are cleaved, generating [[oligomer]]s and [[monomer]]s in its place.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The steps taken to fragment these materials also differ based on the presence of oxygen in the system. The breakdown of materials by microorganisms when oxygen is present is [[aerobic digestion]], and the breakdown of materials when oxygen is not present is [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polimernet.com/Docs/Aerobic%20-%20Anaerobic%20Biodegredation%20en.pdf|title=Aerobic and Anaerobic Biodegradation| work = Fundamentals of Aerobic &amp; Anaerobic Biodegradation Process | publisher = Polimernet Plastik San. Tic. Ltd. Şti. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between these processes is that anaerobic reactions produce [[methane]], while aerobic reactions do not (however, both reactions produce [[carbon dioxide]], [[water]], some type of residue, and a new [[biomass]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edepot.wur.nl/193543|title=Analytical Methods for Monitoring Biodegradation Processes of Environmentally Degradable Polymers|last=Van der Zee|first=Maarten | name-list-style = vanc |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, aerobic digestion typically occurs more rapidly than anaerobic digestion, while anaerobic digestion does a better job reducing the volume and mass of the material.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Due to anaerobic digestion's ability to reduce the volume and mass of [[waste]] materials and produce a natural gas, anaerobic digestion technology is widely used for [[waste management]] systems and as a source of local, renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Klinkner | first = Blake Anthony | name-list-style = vanc | title = Anaerobic Digestion as a Renewable Energy Source and Waste Management Technology: What Must be Done for this Technology to Realize Success in the United States? | url = https://scholarship.law.umassd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=umlr | journal = University of Massachusetts Law Review | volume = 9 | pages = 68–96 | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the assimilation stage, the resulting products from biofragmentation are then integrated into [[microbial cell]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Some of the products from fragmentation are easily transported within the cell by [[membrane carrier]]s. However, others still have to undergo biotransformation reactions to yield products that can then be transported inside the cell. Once inside the cell, the products enter [[catabolic pathway]]s that either lead to the production of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) or elements of the [[anabolism|cells structure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Factors affecting biodegradation rate ==
[[File:Decomposition rates of marine debris items, OWID.svg|thumb|upright=2|Average estimated decomposition times of typical marine debris items. Plastic items are shown in blue.]]
In practice, almost all chemical compounds and materials are subject to biodegradation processes. The significance, however, is in the relative rates of such processes, such as days, weeks, years or centuries. A number of factors determine the rate at which this degradation of organic compounds occurs. Factors include [[light]], [[water]], [[oxygen]] and temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid29972726&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haider T, Völker C, Kramm J, Landfester K, Wurm FR | title = Plastics of the future?

The rate of biodegradation can be measured in a number of ways. [[Respirometry]] tests can be used for [[aerobic microbes]]. First one places a solid waste sample in a container with microorganisms and soil, and then aerates the mixture. Over the course of several days, microorganisms digest the sample bit by bit and produce carbon dioxide – the resulting amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; serves as an indicator of degradation. Biodegradability can also be measured by anaerobic microbes and the amount of methane or alloy that they are able to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Andy | last = Jessop | name-list-style = vanc |url=https://commercialwaste.trade/how-is-biodegradability-measured/ |title=How is biodegradability measured? |date=2015-09-16 |work=Commercial Waste |access-date=2018-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's important to note factors that affect biodegradation rates during product testing to ensure that the results produced are accurate and reliable. Several materials will test as being biodegradable under optimal conditions in a lab for approval but these results may not reflect real world outcomes where factors are more variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Research of the biodegradability of degradable/biodegradable plastic material in various types of environments| vauthors = Adamcova D, Radziemska M, Fronczyk J, Zloch J, Vaverkova MD | journal =  Przegląd Naukowy.

The development and use of accurate standard test methods can help ensure that all plastics that are being produced and commercialized will actually biodegrade in natural environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1995 |editor-last=Scott |editor-first=Gerald |editor2-last=Gilead |editor2-first=Dan | name-list-style = vanc |title=Degradable Polymers | publisher = Dordrecht Springer | location = Netherlands | doi = 10.1007/978-94-011-0571-2 |isbn=978-94-010-4253-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One test that has been developed for this purpose is DINV 54900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Witt U, Yamamoto M, Seeliger U, Müller RJ, Warzelhan V | title = Biodegradable Polymeric Materials-Not the Origin but the Chemical Structure Determines Biodegradability | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 38 | issue = 10 | pages = 1438–1442 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 29711570 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1521-3773(19990517)38:10&lt;1438::aid-anie1438&gt;3.0.co;2-u }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plastics ==
{{Main|Biodegradable plastic#Examples of biodegradable plastics}}

The term Biodegradable Plastics refers to materials that maintain their mechanical strength during practical use but break down into low-weight compounds and non-toxic byproducts after their use.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ikada_2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ikada |first1=Yoshito |last2=Tsuji |first2=Hideto | name-list-style = vanc |date= February 2000 | title = Biodegradable polyesters for medical and ecological applications |journal=Macromolecular Rapid Communications |volume=21|issue=3|pages=117–132 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1521-3927(20000201)21:3&lt;117::aid-marc117&gt;3.0.co;2-x  | url = http://web.mit.edu/course/10/10.569/www/ikadaPEreview.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This breakdown is made possible through an attack of microorganisms on the material, which is typically a non-water-soluble polymer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Such materials can be obtained through chemical synthesis, fermentation by microorganisms, and from chemically modified natural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flieger M, Kantorová M, Prell A, Rezanka T, Votruba J | title = Biodegradable plastics from renewable sources | journal = Folia Microbiologica | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–44 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12744074 | doi = 10.1007/bf02931273 | s2cid = 32800851 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plastics]] biodegrade at highly variable rates.  [[Polyvinylchloride|PVC]]-based plumbing is selected for handling [[sewage]] because PVC resists biodegradation.  Some packaging materials on the other hand are being developed that would degrade readily upon exposure to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kyrikou |first1=Ioanna |last2=Briassoulis |first2=Demetres | name-list-style = vanc |date=12 Apr 2007 |title=Biodegradation of Agricultural Plastic Films: A Critical Review  |journal=Journal of Polymers and the Environment |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=125–150 |doi= 10.1007/s10924-007-0053-8 |s2cid=195331133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[synthetic polymer]]s that biodegrade quickly include [[polycaprolactone]], other [[polyesters]] and aromatic-aliphatic esters, due to their ester bonds being susceptible to attack by water. A prominent example is [[poly-3-hydroxybutyrate]], the renewably derived [[polylactic acid]]. Others are the cellulose-based cellulose acetate and celluloid (cellulose nitrate).

:[[File:Polylactid sceletal.svg|thumb|150px|[[Polylactic acid]] is an example of a plastic that biodegrades quickly.]]
Under [[anaerobic decomposition|low oxygen]] conditions plastics break down more slowly. The breakdown process can be accelerated in specially designed [[compost | compost heap]]. Starch-based plastics will degrade within two to four months in a home compost bin, while polylactic acid is largely undecomposed, requiring higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/33773706.PDF |title= Section 6: Biodegradability of Packaging Waste |publisher=Www3.imperial.ac.uk |access-date=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polycaprolactone and polycaprolactone-starch composites decompose slower, but the starch content accelerates decomposition by leaving behind a porous, high surface area polycaprolactone. Nevertheless, it takes many months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=Chin-San | name-list-style = vanc |title=Physical properties and biodegradability of maleated-polycaprolactone/starch composite |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=January 2003 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=127–134 |doi=10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00393-2 | url = http://www.kyu.edu.tw/93/epaperv6/93-129.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.453.4220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, a bacterium named ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]]'' was found to biodegrade [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].

Many [[plastic producer]]s have gone so far even to say that their plastics are compostable, typically listing [[corn starch]] as an ingredient. However, these claims are questionable because the [[plastics industry]] operates under its own definition of compostable:
:&quot;that which is capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials.&quot; (Ref: [[ASTM]] D 6002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compostable.info/compostable.htm | title = Compostable |publisher=Compostable.info |access-date=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

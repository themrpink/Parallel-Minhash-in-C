[[File:Wilkins Building 1, UCL, London - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Wheeler undertook his BA and MA at University College London (pictured).]]

After passing the [[entrance exam]] on his second attempt, in 1907 Wheeler was awarded a scholarship to read [[classical studies]] at [[University College London]] (UCL), commuting daily from his parental home to the university campus in [[Bloomsbury]], central London.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=623|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=40|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=77}} At UCL, he was taught by the prominent classicist [[A.&amp;nbsp;E. Housman]].{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=624|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=41}} During his undergraduate studies, he became editor of the ''Union Magazine'', for which he produced a number of illustrated cartoons.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=41–42}} Increasingly interested in art, he decided to switch from classical studies to a course at UCL's [[art school]], the [[Slade School of Fine Art]]; he returned to his previous subject after coming to the opinion that – in his words – he never became more than &quot;a conventionally accomplished picture maker&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=624|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=43–44}} This interlude had adversely affected his classical studies, and he received a [[Upper second-class honours|second class]] BA on graduating.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=45}}

Wheeler began studying for a [[Master of Arts]] degree in classical studies, which he attained in 1912.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=624|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=45|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=77}} During this period, he also gained employment as the personal secretary of the UCL Provost [[Gregory Foster]],{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=47}} although he later criticised Foster for transforming the university from &quot;a college in the truly academic sense [into] a hypertrophied monstrosity as little like a college as a plesiosaurus is like a man&quot;.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=40}} It was also at this time of life that he met and began a relationship with [[Tessa Wheeler|Tessa Verney]], a student then studying history at UCL, when they were both serving on the committee of the University College Literary Society.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=47|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=77}}

During his studies, Wheeler had developed his love of archaeology, having joined an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of [[Viroconium Cornoviorum]], a [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] settlement in [[Wroxeter]], in 1913.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=49}} Considering a profession in the discipline, he won a studentship that had been established jointly by the University of London and the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in memory of [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]]. The prominent archaeologist [[Arthur Evans|Sir Arthur Evans]] doubled the amount of money that went with the studentship. Wheeler's proposed project had been to analyse Romano-Rhenish pottery, and with the grant he funded a trip to the [[Rhineland]] in Germany, there studying the Roman pottery housed in local museums; his research into this subject was never published.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=624|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=49–51|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=79}}

At this period, there were very few jobs available within British archaeology; as the later archaeologist [[Stuart Piggott]] related, &quot;the young Wheeler was looking for a professional job where the profession had yet to be created.&quot;{{sfn|Piggott|1977|p=625}} In 1913 Wheeler secured a position as junior investigator for the [[Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (England)|English Royal Commission on Historical Monuments]], who were embarking on a project to assess the state of all structures in the nation that pre-dated 1714. As part of this, he was first sent to [[Stebbing]] in [[Essex]] to assess Late Medieval buildings, although once that was accomplished he focused on studying the Romano-British remains of that county.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1pp=625–626|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=51–52|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=79}} In summer 1914 he married Tessa in a low-key, secular wedding ceremony, before they moved into Wheeler's parental home in Herne Hill.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=626|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=52–53|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3pp=79–80, 82}}

After the United Kingdom's entry into [[World War I]] in 1914, Wheeler [[Recruitment to the British Army during the First World War|volunteered for the armed forces]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=53|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=83}} Although preferring solitary to group activities, Wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed soldiering,{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=626|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=55}} and on 9 November 1914 was commissioned a temporary [[second lieutenant]] in the University of London [[Officers' Training Corps|Officer Training Corps]], serving with its artillery unit as an instructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29045|date=19 January 1915 |page=688 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=53|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=83}} It was during this period, in January 1915, that a son was born to the Wheelers, and named Michael.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=55}} [[Michael Mortimer Wheeler|Michael Wheeler]] was their only child, something that was a social anomaly at the time, although it is unknown if this was by choice or not.{{sfn|Carr|2012|pp=82–83}} In May 1915, Wheeler transferred to the 1st Lowland Brigade of the [[Royal Field Artillery]] ([[Territorial Force]]), and was confirmed in his rank on 1 July, with a promotion to temporary [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] from the same date.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29249|date=3 August 1915 |page=7583 |supp=|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, on 16 July, Wheeler was promoted to temporary [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29288|date=7 September 1915 |page=8964 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this position he was stationed at various bases across Britain, often bringing his wife and child with him; his responsibility was as a battery commander, initially of field guns and later of [[howitzer]]s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1pp=55–56|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=83}}

In October 1917 Wheeler was posted to the 76th Army Field Artillery Brigade, one of the [[Royal Field Artillery]] brigades under the direct control of the [[General Officer Commanding]], [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]]. The brigade was then stationed in Belgium, where it had been engaged in the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] against German troops along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. By now a substantive lieutenant (temporary captain), on 7 October he was appointed second-in-command of an [[artillery battery]] with the acting rank of captain,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30325|date=5 October 1917 |page=10360 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 21 October became commander of a battery with the acting rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30487|date=18 January 1918 |page=1077 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing a major who had been poisoned by [[mustard gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30884|date=3 September 1918 |page=10512 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the Left Group of artillery covering the advancing [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] infantry in the battle.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1pp=56–57|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=83}} Throughout, he maintained correspondences with his wife, his sister Amy, and his parents.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=59|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=85}} After the Allied victory in the battle, the brigade was transferred to Italy.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=60}}

Wheeler and the brigade arrived in Italy on 20 November, and proceeded through the [[Italian Riviera]] to reach [[Caporetto]], where it had been sent to bolster the Italian troops against [[Battle of Caporetto|a German and Austro-Hungarian advance]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=61–63}} As the [[Russian Republic]] removed itself from the war, the German Army refocused its efforts on the Western Front, and so in March 1918 Wheeler's brigade was ordered to leave Italy, getting a train from [[Castelfranco Veneto|Castelfranco]] to [[Rouen|Vieux Rouen]] in France.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=63}} Back on the Western Front, the brigade was assigned to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]], again part of [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|Julian Byng]]'s Third Army, reaching a stable area of the front in April. Here, Wheeler was engaged in artillery fire for several months, before the British went on the offensive in August.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=63–68}} On 24 August, in between the ruined villages of Achiet and [[Sapignies]], he led an expedition which captured two German field guns while under heavy fire from a castle mound; he was later awarded the [[Military Cross]] for this action:{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=69–71}}

{{Quotation|For conspicuous gallantry and initiative. While making a reconnaissance he saw two enemy field guns limbered up without horses within 300 yards of the outpost line.

He did fine work.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31043|date=29 November 1918 |page=14268 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wheeler continued as part of the British forces pushing westward until the German surrender in November 1918,{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=72–73}} receiving a [[mention in dispatches]] on 8 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31080|date=20 December 1918 |page=15032 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not demobilised for several months, instead being stationed at [[Pulheim]] in Germany until March; during this time he wrote up his earlier research on Romano-Rhenish pottery, making use of access to local museums, before returning to London in July 1919.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1pp=73–74|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=86}} Reverting to his permanent rank of lieutenant on 16 September,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31609|date=17 October 1919 |page=12882 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheeler was finally discharged from service on 30 September 1921, retaining the rank of major.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=32521|date=15 November 1921 |page=9141 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===National Museum of Wales: 1919–26===

On returning to London, Wheeler moved into a top-floor flat near [[Gordon Square]] with his wife and child.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=77|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=87}} He returned to working for the Royal Commission, examining and cataloguing the historic structures of Essex.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=77|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=87}} In doing so, he produced his first publication, an [[Scholarly paper|academic paper]] on Colchester's Roman [[Balkerne Gate]] which was published in the ''Transactions of the [[Essex Society for Archaeology and History|Essex Archaeological Society]]'' in 1920.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=78}} He soon followed this with two papers in the ''[[Journal of Roman Studies]]''; the first offered a wider analysis of Roman Colchester, while the latter outlined his discovery of the vaulting for the city's Temple of [[Claudius]] which was destroyed by [[Boudica]]'s revolt. In doing so, he developed a reputation as a Roman archaeologist in Britain.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=78}} He then submitted his research on Romano-Rhenish pots to the University of London, on the basis of which he was awarded his [[Doctor of Letters|Doctorate of Letters]]; thenceforth until his knighthood he styled himself as Dr Wheeler.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=78–79}} He was unsatisfied with his job in the Commission, unhappy that he was receiving less pay and a lower status than he had had in the army, and so began to seek out alternative employment.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=77, 79}}

He obtained a post as the Keeper of Archaeology at the [[National Museum Wales|National Museum of Wales]], a job that also entailed becoming a lecturer in archaeology at the [[University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire]]. Taking up this position, he moved to [[Cardiff]] with his family in August 1920, although he initially disliked the city.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=626|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=79, 83|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=87}} The museum was in disarray; prior to the war, construction had begun on a new purpose-built building to house the collections. This had ceased during the conflict and the edifice was left abandoned during Cardiff's post-war economic slump.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=80}} Wheeler recognised that Wales was very divided regionally, with many Welsh people having little loyalty to Cardiff; thus, he made a point of touring the country, lecturing to local societies about archaeology.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=627|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=84}} According to the later archaeologist Lydia C. Carr, the Wheelers' work for the cause of the museum was part of a wider &quot;cultural-nationalist movement&quot; linked to growing [[Welsh nationalism]] during this period; for instance, the Welsh nationalist party [[Plaid Cymru]] was founded in 1925.{{sfn|Carr|2012|pp=90–91}}

Wheeler was impatient to start excavations, and in July 1921 started a six-week project to excavate at the Roman fort of [[Segontium]]; accompanied by his wife, he used up his holiday to oversee the project. A second season of excavation at the site followed in 1922.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=626|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=85–86|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=96}} Greatly influenced by the writings of the archaeologist [[Augustus Pitt-Rivers]], Wheeler emphasised the need for a strong, developed methodology when undertaking an archaeological excavation, believing in the need for strategic planning, or what he termed &quot;controlled discovery&quot;, with clear objectives in mind for a project.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=81|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2pp=95–96}} Further emphasising the importance of prompt publication of research results, he wrote full seasonal reports for ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'' before publishing a full report, ''Segontium and the Roman Occupation of Wales''.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=86|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=96}} Wheeler was keen on training new generations of archaeologists, and two of the most prominent students to excavate with him at Segontium were [[Victor Erle Nash-Williams|Victor Nash-Williams]] and [[Ian Richmond]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=82}}

Over the field seasons of 1924 and 1925, Wheeler ran excavations of the Roman fort of [[Y Gaer]] near [[Brecon]], a project aided by his wife and two archaeological students, [[Nowell Myres]] and [[Christopher Hawkes]].{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=626|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=90|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3pp=100–102}} During this project, he was visited by the prominent Egyptologist [[Flinders Petrie|Sir Flinders Petrie]] and his wife [[Hilda Petrie]]; Wheeler greatly admired Petrie's emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=91|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=104}} Wheeler published the results of his excavation in ''The Roman Fort Near Brecon''.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=95}} He then began excavations at [[Isca Augusta]], a Roman site in [[Caerleon]], where he focused on revealing the Roman amphitheatre. Intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding, he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the [[middle-market newspaper]] the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. In doing so, he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with [[King Arthur]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1pp=95–96|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2pp=110–114}} In 1925, [[Oxford University Press]] published Wheeler's first book for a general audience, ''Prehistoric and Roman Wales''; he later expressed the opinion that it was not a good book.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=627|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=93}}

In 1924, the Director of the National Museum of Wales, [[William Evans Hoyle]], resigned amid ill health.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=92}} Wheeler applied to take on the role of his replacement, providing supportive testimonials from [[Charles Reed Peers]], [[Robert Carr Bosanquet|Robert Bosanquet]], and [[H. J. Fleure]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=92}} Although he had no prior museum experience, he was successful in his application and was appointed Director.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=626|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=93|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=106}} He then employed a close friend, [[Cyril Fox]], to take on the vacated position of Keeper of Archaeology.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=93–94}} Wheeler's proposed reforms included extending the institution's reach and influence throughout Wales by building affiliations with regional museums, and focusing on fundraising to finance the completion of the new museum premises.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=92}} He obtained a £21,367 donation from the wealthy shipowner [[William Reardon Smith]] and appointed Smith to be the museum's treasurer, and also travelled to [[Whitehall]], London, where he successfully urged the [[British Treasury]] to provide further funding for the museum.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=94}} As a result, construction on the museum's new building was able to continue, and it was officially opened by King [[George V]] in 1927.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=94–95}}

===London Museum: 1926–33===

[[File:Lancaster House London April 2006 032.jpg|thumb|right|Lancaster House, where London Museum was based]]

Upon the retirement of the Keeper of the [[London Museum]], Harmon Oates, Wheeler was invited to fill the vacancy. He had been considering a return to London for some time and eagerly agreed, taking on the post, which was based at [[Lancaster House]] in the [[St James's]] area, in July 1926.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=628|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=99–100|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=107}} In Wales, many felt that Wheeler had simply taken the directorship of the National Museum to advance his own career prospects, and that he had abandoned them when a better offer came along. Wheeler himself disagreed, believing that he had left Fox at the Museum as his obvious successor, and that the reforms he had implemented would therefore continue.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=101}} The position initially provided Wheeler with an annual salary of £600, which resulted in a decline in living standards for his family, who moved into a flat near to [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=107}}

Tessa's biographer L. C. Carr later commented that together, the Wheelers &quot;professionalized the London Museum&quot;.{{sfn|Carr|2012|p=137}} Wheeler expressed his opinion that the museum &quot;had to be cleaned, expurgated, and catalogued; in general, turned from a junk shop into a tolerably rational institution&quot;.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=109}} Focusing on reorganising the exhibits and developing a more efficient method of cataloguing the artefacts, he also authored ''A Short Guide to the Collections'', before using the items in the museum to write three books: ''London and the Vikings'', ''London and the Saxons'', and ''London and the Romans''.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=628|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=109–110}} Upon his arrival, the Treasury allocated the museum an annual budget of £5,000, which Wheeler deemed insufficient for its needs.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=112}} In 1930, Wheeler persuaded them to increase that budget, as he highlighted increasing visitor numbers, publications, and acquisitions, as well as a rise in the number of educational projects. With this additional funding, he was able to employ more staff and increase his own annual salary to £900.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=113}}

Soon after joining the museum, Wheeler was elected to the council of the Society of Antiquaries.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=110}} Through the Society, he became involved in the debate as to who should finance archaeological supervision of building projects in [[Greater London]]; his argument was that the [[City of London Corporation]] should provide the funding, although in 1926 it was agreed that the Society itself would employ a director of excavation based in Lancaster House to take on the position.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=110–112}} Also involved in the largely moribund [[Royal Archaeological Institute]], Wheeler organised its relocation to Lancaster House.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=123–124}} In 1927, Wheeler took on an unpaid lectureship at University College London, where he established a [[graduate diploma]] course on archaeology; one of the first to enroll was Stuart Piggott.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=127–128}} In 1928, Wheeler curated an exhibit at UCL on &quot;Recent Work in British Archaeology&quot;, for which he attracted much press attention.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=127}}

[[File:RomanTheatreVerulamium-PS1.jpg|thumb|left|Wheeler excavated at Verulamium; the city's Roman theatre is depicted.]]

Wheeler was keen to continue archaeological fieldwork outside London, undertaking excavations every year from 1926 to 1939.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=144}} After completing his excavation of the Carlaeon amphitheatre in 1928, he began fieldwork at the Roman settlement and temple in [[Lydney Park]], [[Gloucestershire]], having been invited to do so by the aristocratic landowner, [[Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe|Charles Bathurst]].{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=631|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=145|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3pp=156–160}} It was during these investigations that Wheeler personally discovered the Lydney Hoard of coinage.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1pp=48–49|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=166}} Wheeler and his wife jointly published their excavation report in 1932 as ''Report on the Excavation of the Prehistoric, Roman and Post-Roman Site in Lydney Park, Gloucestershire'',{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=146}} which Piggott noted had &quot;set the pattern&quot; for all Wheeler's future excavation reports.{{sfn|Piggott|1977|pp=631–632}}

From there, Wheeler was invited to direct a Society of Antiquaries excavation at the Roman settlement of [[Verulamium]], which existed on land recently acquired by the Corporation of St Albans. He took on this role for four seasons from 1930 to 1933, before leaving a fifth season of excavation under the control of the archaeologist [[Kathleen Kenyon]] and the architect A. W. G. Lowther.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1pp=149–151, 158–159|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2pp=172–175}} Wheeler enjoyed the opportunity to excavate at a civilian as opposed to military site, and also liked its proximity to his home in London.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=152}} He was particularly interested in searching for a pre-Roman Iron Age [[oppidum]] at the site, noting that the existence of a nearby [[Catuvellauni]] settlement was attested to in both classical texts and numismatic evidence.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1pp=152–155|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=179}} With Wheeler focusing his attention on potential Iron Age evidence, Tessa concentrated on excavating the inside of the city walls; Wheeler had affairs with at least three assistants during the project.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=155–156}} After Tessa wrote two interim reports, the final excavation report was finally published in 1936 as ''Verulamium: A Belgic and Two Roman Cities'', jointly written by Wheeler and his wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=159|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=181}} The report resulted in the first major published criticism of Wheeler, produced by the young archaeologist Nowell Myres in a review for ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]''; although stating that there was much to praise about the work, he critiqued Wheeler's selective excavation, dubious dating, and guesswork. Wheeler responded with a piece in which he defended his work and launched a personal attack on both Myres and Myres's employer, [[Christ Church, Oxford]].{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=634|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=159–162|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3pp=188–189}}

Wheeler had long desired to establish an academic institution devoted to archaeology that could be based in London.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=129}} He hoped that it could become a centre in which to establish the professionalisation of archaeology as a discipline, with systematic training of students in methodological techniques of excavation and conservation and recognised professional standards; in his words, he hoped &quot;to convert archaeology into a discipline worthy of that name in all senses&quot;.{{sfn|Piggott|1977|p=630}} He further described his intention that the Institute should become &quot;a laboratory: a laboratory of archaeological science&quot;.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=6}}
Many archaeologists shared his hopes, and to this end Petrie had donated much of his collection of Near Eastern artefacts to Wheeler, in the hope that it would be included in such an institution.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=129}} Wheeler was later able to persuade the University of London, a federation of institutions across the capital, to support the venture, and both he and Tessa began raising funds from wealthy backers.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=130}} In 1934, the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]] was officially opened, albeit at this point without premises or academic staff; the first students to enroll were Rachel Clay and Barbara Parker, who went on to have careers in the discipline.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=130}} While Wheeler – who was still Keeper of the London Museum – took on the role of Honorary Director of the Institute, he installed the archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon as secretary of the Management Committee, describing her as &quot;a level-headed person, with useful experience&quot;.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=132}} That June, he was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of Saint John]] (OStJ).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=34064|date=26 June 1934 |page=4058 |supp=|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ending his work at Verulamium, Wheeler turned his attention to the late Iron Age hill-fort of [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]] near to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], [[Dorset]], where he excavated for four seasons from 1934 to 1937.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=633|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=162, 172}} Co-directed by Wheeler, Tessa, and the Curator of [[Dorset County Museum]], Charles Drew, the project was carried out under the joint auspices of the Society of Antiquaries and the Dorset Field Club.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=163|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=212}} With around 100 assistants each season, the dig constituted the largest excavation that had been conducted in Britain up to that point, with Wheeler organising weekly meetings with the press to inform them about any discoveries.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=163, 166}} He was keen to emphasise that his workforce consisted of many young people as well as both men and women, thus presenting the image of archaeology as a modern and advanced discipline.{{sfn|Stout|2008|p=218}} According to the later historian Adam Stout, the Maiden Castle excavation was &quot;one of the most famous British archaeological investigations of the twentieth century. It was the classic 'Wheeler dig', both in terms of scale of operations and the publicity which it generated.&quot;{{sfn|Stout|2008|p=217}}

Wheeler's excavation report was published in 1943 as ''Maiden Castle, Dorset''.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=633|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=175|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=235}} The report's publication allowed further criticism to be voiced of Wheeler's approach and interpretations; in his review of the book, the archaeologist [[W. F. Grimes]] criticised the highly selective nature of the excavation, noting that Wheeler had not asked questions regarding the socio-economic issues of the community at Maiden Castle, aspects of past societies that had come to be of increasing interest to British archaeology.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=634|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=175–176|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=236}} Over coming decades, as further excavations were carried out at the site and archaeologists developed a greater knowledge of Iron Age Britain, much of Wheeler's interpretation of the site and its development was shown to be wrong, in particular by the work of the archaeologist Niall Sharples.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1p=177|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=235}}

In 1936, Wheeler embarked on a visit to the [[Near East]], sailing from [[Marseilles]] to [[Port Said]], where he visited the [[Old Kingdom]] tombs of [[Sakkara]]. From there he went via [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] to Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria. During this trip, he visited various archaeological projects, but was dismayed by the quality of their excavations; in particular, he noted that the American-run excavation at [[Tel Megiddo]] was adopting standards that had been rejected in Britain twenty-five years previously.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=133}} He was away for six weeks, and upon his return to Europe discovered that his wife Tessa had died of a [[pulmonary embolism]] after a minor operation on her toe.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1pp=134, 138|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=231}} According to Tessa's biographer, for Wheeler this discovery was &quot;the peak of mental misery, and marked the end of his ability to feel a certain kind of love&quot;.{{sfn|Carr|2012|p=241}} That winter, his father also died.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=139}} By the summer of 1937, he had embarked on a new romance, with a young woman named Mavis de Vere Cole, widow of [[Horace de Vere Cole]], who had first met Wheeler when visiting the Maiden Castle excavations with her then-lover, the painter [[Augustus John]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hawkes|1y=1982|1pp=167, 181–184|2a1=Carr|2y=2012|2p=234}} After she eventually agreed to his repeated requests for marriage, the two were wedded early in 1939 in a ceremony held at [[Caxton Hall]], with a reception at Shelley House.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=190–191}} They proceeded on a [[honeymoon]] to the Middle East.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=192}}

[[File:St John's Lodge, Regent's Park.jpg|left|thumb|250px|St. John's Lodge in Regent's Park, the first building to house the Institute of Archaeology]]

After a search that had taken several years, Wheeler was able to secure a premises for the Institute of Archaeology: [[St John's Lodge, London|St. John's Lodge]] in [[Regent's Park]], central London. Left empty since its use as a hospital during the First World War, the building was owned by the Crown and was controlled by the [[First Commissioner of Works]], [[William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech|William Ormsby-Gore]]; he was very sympathetic to archaeology, and leased the building to the Institute at a low rent.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=628|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=131–132|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3pp=149–150}} The St. John's Lodge premises were officially opened on 29 April 1937. During his speech at the ceremony, the University of London's Vice-Chancellor Charles Reed Peers made it clear that the building was only intended as a temporary home for the Institute, which it was hoped would be able to move to Bloomsbury, the city's academic hub.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=140–141}} In his speech, the university's Chancellor, [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone]], compared the new institution to both the [[Institute of Historical Research]] and the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]].{{sfn|Piggott|1977|p=629}}

Wheeler had also become President of the [[Museums Association]], and in a presidential address given in [[Belfast]] talked on the topic of preserving museum collections in war time, believing that Britain's involvement in a second European conflict was imminent.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=184}} In anticipation of this event, in August 1939 he arranged for the London Museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=193–194}} He was also awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Bristol University]], and at the award ceremony met the Conservative Party politician [[Winston Churchill]], who was then engaged in writing his multi-volume ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]''; Churchill asked Wheeler to aid him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval Britain, to which the latter agreed.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=184}}

After Maiden Castle, Wheeler turned his attention to France, where the archaeological investigation of Iron Age sites had lagged behind developments in Britain. There, he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with the aid of Leslie Scott, beginning with a survey tour of [[Brittany]] in the winter of 1936–37.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1pp=634–635|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=178–179}} After this, Wheeler decided to excavate the oppidum at Camp d'Artus, near [[Huelgoat]], [[Finistère]]. In addition to bringing many British archaeologists to work on the site, he hired six local Breton workmen to assist the project, coming to the belief that the oppidum had been erected by local Iron Age tribes to defend themselves from the Roman invasion led by [[Julius Caesar]]. Meanwhile, Scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at the smaller nearby hill fort of Kercaradec, near [[Quimper]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=181, 184–187}} In July 1939, the project focused its attention on [[Normandy]], with excavations beginning at the Iron Age hill forts of Camp de Canada and [[Duclair]]. They were brought to an abrupt halt in September 1939 as the [[Second World War]] broke out in Europe, and the team evacuated back to Britain.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=192–194}} Wheeler's excavation report, co-written with Katherine Richardson, was eventually published as ''Hill-forts of Northern France'' in 1957.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=635|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=194–195}}

===Second World War: 1939–45===

Wheeler had been expecting and openly hoping for war with [[Nazi Germany]] for a year prior to the outbreak of hostilities; he believed that the United Kingdom's involvement in the conflict would remedy the shame that he thought had been brought upon the country by its signing of the [[Munich Agreement]] in September 1938.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=189}} Volunteering for the armed services, on 18 July 1939 he returned to active service as a major (Special List).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=34660|date=29 August 1939 |page=5925 |supp=|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to assemble the 48th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery at [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], where he set about recruiting volunteers, including his son [[Michael Mortimer Wheeler|Michael]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=196–198}} As the 48th swelled in size, it was converted into the 42nd Mobile Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment in the [[Royal Artillery]], which consisted of four batteries and was led by Wheeler – now promoted to the temporary rank of [[lieutenant-colonel]] (effective 27 January 1940) – as Commanding Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=522f|title=The Quarterly Army List: October 1942 (Part I)|first= |last=|publisher=HM Stationery Office|year=1942|isbn=|subject=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=198, 199}} Given the nickname of &quot;Flash Alf&quot; by those serving under him,{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=635|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=198}} he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from [[influenza]] during training.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=198–199}} Having been appointed secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939 and then director in 1940, he travelled to London to deal with society affairs on various occasions.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=200}} In 1941 Wheeler was awarded a Fellowship of the British Academy.{{sfn|Piggott|1977|p=638}} Cole had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named Clive Entwistle, who lambasted Wheeler as &quot;that whiskered baboon&quot;. When Wheeler discovered Entwistle in bed with his wife, he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in March 1942.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=200–202}}

In the summer of 1941, Wheeler and three of his batteries were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the [[North African Campaign]]. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the [[RMS Empress of Russia|RMS ''Empress of Russia'']]; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, they were forced to travel via the [[Cape of Good Hope]], before taking shore leave in [[Durban]]. There, Wheeler visited the local [[kraal]]s to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=203–205}} The ship docked in [[Aden]], where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=206}} They soon reached the British-controlled [[Suez]], where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the [[Great Bitter Lake]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=207}} There, Wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to [[Jerusalem]], where he visited Petrie on his hospital deathbed.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=207–208}} Back in Egypt, he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington bomber]] on a bombing raid against Axis forces, to better understand what it was like for aircrew to be fired on by an anti-aircraft battery.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=208}}

[[File:Forum leptis magna.JPG|thumb|left|In North Africa, Wheeler sought to preserve archaeological remains, such as those of Leptis Magna (pictured), from being damaged by occupying troops.]]

Serving with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]], Wheeler was present in North Africa when the Axis armies pushed the Allies back to [[El Alamein]]. He was also part of the Allied counter-push, taking part in the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the advance on Axis-held [[Tripoli]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=209–216}} On the way he became concerned that the archaeological sites of North Africa were being threatened both by the fighting and the occupying forces. After the British secured control of Libya, Wheeler visited Tripoli and [[Leptis Magna]], where he found that Roman remains had been damaged and vandalised by British troops; he brought about reforms to prevent this, lecturing to the troops on the importance of preserving archaeology, making many monuments out-of-bounds, and ensuring that the [[Royal Air Force]] changed its plans to construct a radar station in the midst of a Roman settlement.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=635|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=216–218}} Aware that the British were planning to invade and occupy the Italian island of [[Sicily]], he insisted that measures be introduced to preserve the historic and archaeological monuments on the island.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=218}}

Promoted to the acting rank of [[brigadier]] on 1 May 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=522f|title=The Quarterly Army List: December 1946 (Part I)|first= |last=|publisher=HM Stationery Office|year=1946|isbn=|subject=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the German surrender in North Africa, Wheeler was sent to [[Algiers]] where he was part of the staff committee planning [[Allied invasion of Italy|the invasion of Italy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=635|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=219–220}} There, he learned that the [[India Office]] had requested that the army relieve him of his duties to permit him to be appointed Director General of Archaeology in India. Although he had never been to the country, he agreed that he would take the job on the condition that he be permitted to take part in the invasion of Italy first.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=635|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=220–221}} As intended, Wheeler and his 12th Anti-Aircraft Brigade then took part in the invasion of Sicily and then mainland Italy, where they were ordered to use their anti-aircraft guns to protect the [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British 10th Corps]].{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=635|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=122–124}} As the Allies advanced north through Italy, Wheeler spent time in [[Naples]] and then [[Capri]], where he met various aristocrats who had anti-fascist sympathies.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=124–126}}

Wheeler left Italy in November 1943 and returned to London. There, he resigned as the director of the London Museum and focused on organising the Institute of Archaeology, preparing it for its adoption of a new director, [[V. Gordon Childe]], after the war. He also resigned as director of the Society of Antiquaries, but was appointed the group's representative to the newly formed [[Council for British Archaeology]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=226–227}} He developed a relationship with a woman named Kim Collingridge, and asked her to marry him. As she was a devout [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], he officially converted to the religion, something which shocked many of his friends, who believed that he was being dishonest because he did not genuinely believe in the doctrines of the faith.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=227–229}} He then set sail for [[Bombay]] aboard a transport ship, the ''City of Exeter'', in February 1944.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=229}}

===Archaeological Survey of India: 1944–48===

[[File:ArikameduRomanCeramic.jpg|thumb|right|It was Wheeler who discovered evidence for Roman trade links at Arikamedu, as evidenced by ceramics such as this.]]

Wheeler arrived in Bombay in the spring of 1944. There, he was welcomed by the city's governor, [[John Colville, 1st Baron Clydesmuir|John Colville]], before heading by train to [[Delhi]] and then [[Simla, West Bengal|Simla]], where the headquarters of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] were located.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=232–233}} Wheeler had been suggested for the job by [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy of India]], who had been acting on the recommendations of the archaeologist [[Leonard Woolley]], who had authored a report lamenting the state of the archaeological establishment in the British-controlled subcontinent.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1pp=635–636|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=230–231|3a1=Guha|3y=2003a|3pp=4–5}} Wheeler recognised this state of affairs, in a letter to a friend complaining about the lack of finances and equipment, commenting that &quot;We're back in 1850&quot;.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=234}} He initially found much to dislike in India, and in his letters to friends in Britain expressed derogatory and [[racism|racist]] sentiments toward Indians: he stated that &quot;they feed wrongly and think wrongly and live wrongly&amp;nbsp;... I already find myself regarding them as ill-made clockwork toys rather than as human beings, and I find myself bullying them most brutally.&quot;{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=234}} He expelled those staff members whom he deemed too idle, and physically beat others in an attempt to motivate them.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=234}}

From the beginning of his tenure, he sought to distance himself from previous Directors-General and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors.{{sfn|Guha|2003a|pp=6–7}} Assigned with a four-year contract, Wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from Britain, [[Glyn Daniel]] and Stuart Piggott, to aid him in reforming the Archaeological Survey, although they declined the offer.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=233}} He then toured the subcontinent, seeking to meet all of the Survey's staff members.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=235}} He had drawn up a prospectus containing research questions that he wanted the Survey to focus on; these included understanding the period between the Bronze Age [[Indus Valley Civilization]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire]], discerning the socio-cultural background to the [[Vedas]], dating the [[Indo-Aryan migration hypothesis|Aryan invasion]], and establishing a dating system for southern India prior to the sixth century CE.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=636|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=235}} During his time in office he also achieved a 25 per cent budget increase for the Archaeological Survey,{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=245}} and convinced the government to agree to the construction of a [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum of Archaeology]], to be built in New Delhi.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=252}}

In October 1944, he opened his six-month archaeological field school in [[Taxila]], where he instructed various students from across India in the methodologies of the discipline.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=637|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=240}} Wheeler became very fond of his students, with one of them, [[B. B. Lal]], later commenting that &quot;behind the gruff exterior, Sir Mortimer had a very kind and sympathetic heart&quot;.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=241}} Throughout his period in India, his students were some of the only individuals to whom Wheeler warmed; more widely, he was annoyed by what he saw as the idleness, incompetence and corruption of Indian society.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=254}} Initially focusing on the northwest of the subcontinent, Wheeler was particularly fascinated by the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization. On his initial inspection of the Indus Valley sites of [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]], he organised a very brief excavation which revealed fortifications around both settlements.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=236–237}} He later led a more detailed excavation at Harappa, where he exposed further fortifications and established a [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphy]] for the settlement.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=637|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=250–251}}

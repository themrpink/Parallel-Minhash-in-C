==Traditional problems raised concerning reason==
Philosophy is sometimes described as a life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve [[knowledge]] of [[truth]] better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, can be expected to achieve a [[eudaimonia|happy life]] more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).

===Reason versus truth, and &quot;first principles&quot;===
{{See also|Truth|First principle|Nous}}
Since [[classical antiquity|classical]] times a question has remained constant in philosophical debate (which is sometimes seen as a conflict between movements called [[Platonism]] and [[Aristotelianism]]) concerning the role of reason in confirming [[truth]]. People use logic, [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], and [[inductive reasoning|induction]], to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered, according to Aristotle, more certain than sense perceptions on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Example: Aristotle ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D981b 981b]: τὴν ὀνομαζομένην σοφίαν περὶ τὰ πρῶτα αἴτια καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς ὑπολαμβάνουσι πάντες: ὥστε, καθάπερ εἴρηται πρότερον, ὁ μὲν ἔμπειρος τῶν ὁποιανοῦν ἐχόντων αἴσθησιν εἶναι δοκεῖ σοφώτερος, ὁ δὲ τεχνίτης τῶν ἐμπείρων, χειροτέχνου δὲ ἀρχιτέκτων, αἱ δὲ θεωρητικαὶ τῶν ποιητικῶν μᾶλλον. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D981b English]: &quot;...what is called Wisdom is concerned with the primary causes and principles, so that, as has been already stated, the man of experience is held to be wiser than the mere possessors of any power of sensation, the artist than the man of experience, the master craftsman than the artisan; and the speculative sciences to be more learned than the productive.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions, then, our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1009b 1009b] ποῖα οὖν τούτων ἀληθῆ ἢ ψευδῆ, ἄδηλον: οὐθὲν γὰρ μᾶλλον τάδε ἢ τάδε ἀληθῆ, ἀλλ᾽ ὁμοίως. διὸ Δημόκριτός γέ φησιν ἤτοι οὐθὲν εἶναι ἀληθὲς ἢ ἡμῖν γ᾽ ἄδηλον. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1009b English] &quot;Thus it is uncertain which of these impressions are true or false; for one kind is no more true than another, but equally so. And hence Democritus says that either there is no truth or we cannot discover it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

This leads to the question of what types of [[first principles]], or starting points of reasoning, are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions. In Greek, &quot;[[first principles]]&quot; are ''[[Arche|archai]]'', &quot;starting points&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;For example Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D983a 983a]: ἐπεὶ δὲ φανερὸν ὅτι τῶν ἐξ ''ἀρχῆς'' αἰτίων δεῖ λαβεῖν ''ἐπιστήμην'' （τότε γὰρ εἰδέναι φαμὲν ἕκαστον, ὅταν τὴν ''πρώτην'' αἰτίαν οἰώμεθα ''γνωρίζειν''） [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D983a English] &quot;It is clear that we must obtain knowledge of the ''primary'' causes, because it is when we think that we understand its ''primary'' cause that we claim to ''know'' each particular thing.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;Example: ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0053%3Abekker+page%3D1139a 1139b]: ἀμφοτέρων δὴ τῶν ''νοητικῶν'' μορίων ἀλήθεια τὸ ἔργον. καθ᾽ ἃς οὖν μάλιστα ἕξεις ἀληθεύσει ἑκάτερον, αὗται ἀρεταὶ ἀμφοῖν. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1139a English] The attainment of truth is then the function of both the ''intellectual'' parts of the soul. Therefore their respective virtues are those dispositions that will best qualify them to attain truth.&lt;/ref&gt; and Plato&lt;ref&gt;Example: Plato ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0167%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D490b 490b]: μιγεὶς τῷ ὄντι ὄντως, γεννήσας νοῦν καὶ ἀλήθειαν, γνοίη [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0094%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D490b English]: &quot;Consorting with reality really, he would beget intelligence and truth, attain to knowledge&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as ''[[nous]]'' which was close in meaning to ''awareness'' or ''[[consciousness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This quest for the beginnings proceeds through sense perception, reasoning, and what they call ''noesis'', which is literally translated by &quot;understanding&quot; or intellect,&quot; and which we can perhaps translate a little bit more cautiously by &quot;awareness,&quot; an awareness of the mind's eye as distinguished from sensible awareness.&quot; &quot;Progress or Return&quot; in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empiricism]] (sometimes associated with Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;However, the empiricism of Aristotle must certainly be doubted. For example in ''Metaphysics'' 1009b, cited above, he criticizes people who think knowledge might not be possible because, &quot;They say that the impression given through sense-perception is necessarily true; for it is on these grounds that both [[Empedocles]] and Democritus and practically all the rest have become obsessed by such opinions as these.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; but more correctly associated with [[Great Britain|British]] philosophers such as [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]], as well as their ancient equivalents such as [[Democritus]]) asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth. This approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that [[absolute knowledge]] is not attainable. [[Idealism]], (associated with Plato and his school), claims that there is a &quot;higher&quot; reality, from which certain people can directly arrive at truth without needing to rely only upon the senses, and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth.

Philosophers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Maimonides]], [[Aquinas]] and [[Hegel]] are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable—perhaps by dialectic, analysis, or study. In the vision of these thinkers, reason is divine or at least has divine attributes. Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Étienne Gilson]] to try to show that reason and [[revelation]] are compatible. According to Hegel, &quot;...the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of [[History]], is the simple conception of reason; that reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;G.W.F. Hegel [[Lectures on the Philosophy of History|''The Philosophy of History'']], p. 9, Dover Publications Inc., {{ISBN|0-486-20112-0}}; 1st ed. 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 17th century [[rationalist]]s, reason has often been taken to be a [[subjectivity|subjective faculty]], or rather the unaided ability ([[pure reason]]) to form concepts.  For [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], this was associated with [[mathematics]]. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts ([[time]] and [[space]]) that are the conditions of experience. Kant made his argument in opposition to Hume, who denied that reason had any role to play in experience.

===Reason versus emotion or passion===
{{See also|Emotion|Passion (emotion)}}
After Plato and Aristotle,  [[western literature]] often treated reason as being the faculty that trained the passions and appetites.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[Stoic philosophy]] by contrast considered all passions undesirable.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} After the critiques of reason in the early Enlightenment the appetites were rarely discussed or conflated with the passions.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Some Enlightenment camps took after the Stoics to say Reason should oppose Passion rather than order it, while others like the Romantics believed that Passion displaces Reason, as in the maxim &quot;follow your heart&quot;.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Reason has been seen as a slave, or judge, of the passions, notably  in the work of [[David Hume]], and more recently  of [[Freud]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Reasoning which claims that the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called ''[[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Rousseau]] first proposed, in his second ''[[Discourse on Inequality|Discourse]]'', that reason and political life is not natural and possibly harmful to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|chapter=Speech. Imagination, Origins: Rousseau and the Political Animal|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind. What, other than reason and civil society, &quot;best suits his constitution&quot;? Rousseau saw &quot;two principles prior to reason&quot; in human nature. First we hold an intense interest in our own well-being. Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being, especially one like ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rousseau|chapter=Preface|title=Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men or Second Discourse|publisher=Cambridge University Press|editor=Gourevitch|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve. We become dependent upon each other, and on relationships of authority and obedience. This effectively puts the human race into slavery. Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy. According to Velkley, &quot;Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self-correction, most notably the political legislation of the ''[[The Social Contract|Contrat Social]]'' and the moral education in ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Émile]]''. All the same, Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition, that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity.&quot;

This quandary presented by Rousseau led to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil. These therefore are not to be blamed on nature or God. In various ways,  [[German Idealism]] after Kant, and major later figures such [[Nietzsche]], [[Bergson]], [[Husserl]], [[Max Scheler|Scheler]], and [[Heidegger]], remain preoccupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or ''urges'' of ''reason''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|chapter=Freedom, Teleology, and Justification of Reason|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Rousseau and these later writers is also large upon art and politics. Many writers (such as [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]) extol passion and disparage reason. In politics modern [[nationalism]] comes from Rousseau's argument that rationalist [[cosmopolitanism]] brings man ever further from his natural state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter=Rousseau and the Origins of Nationalism|last=Plattner|first=Marc|year=1997|publisher=University of Chicago Press|title=The Legacy of Rousseau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view on reason and emotion was proposed in the 1994 book titled ''[[Descartes' Error]]'' by [[Antonio Damasio]]. In it, Damasio presents the &quot;[[Somatic marker hypothesis|Somatic Marker Hypothesis]]&quot; which states that emotions guide behavior and decision-making. Damasio argues that these somatic markers (known collectively as &quot;gut feelings&quot;) are &quot;intuitive signals&quot; that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone. Damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function.

===Reason versus faith or tradition===
{{Main|Faith|Religion|Tradition}}
There are many religious traditions, some of which are explicitly [[Fideism|fideist]] and others of which claim varying degrees of [[rationalism]]. Secular critics sometimes accuse all religious adherents of irrationality, since they claim such adherents are guilty of ignoring, suppressing, or forbidding some kinds of reasoning concerning some subjects (such as religious dogmas, moral taboos, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The God Delusion|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|year=2008|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=978-0-618-91824-9|edition=Reprint|language=English|quote=Scientists... see the fight for evolution as only one battle in a larger war: a looming war between supernaturalism on the one side and rationality on the other.|url=https://archive.org/details/goddelusion00dawk_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the [[theology|theologies]] and [[religion]]s such as [[Monotheism|classical monotheism]] typically do not claim to be [[irrationality|irrational]], there is often a perceived conflict or tension between [[faith]] and [[tradition]] on the one hand, and reason on the other, as potentially competing sources of [[wisdom]], [[law]] and [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Strauss|title=An Introduction to Political Philosophy|chapter=Progress or Return|first=Leo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|volume= 2|issue=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings |chapter=XVIII Of Faith and Reason, and their distinct Provinces.|origyear=1689|chapter-url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=762&amp;layout=html#chapter_80844|edition=12th|year=1824|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious adherents sometimes respond by arguing that faith and reason can be reconciled, or have different non-overlapping domains, or that critics engage in a similar kind of irrationalism:
* ''Reconciliation'': Philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] argues that there is no real conflict between reason and classical theism because classical theism explains (among other things) why the universe is intelligible and why reason can successfully grasp it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-981209-7|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Signs and Knowledge of God: A New Look at Theistic Arguments|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-966107-7|edition=Reprint|location=Oxford|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Non-overlapping magisteria'': Evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argues that there need not be conflict between reason and religious belief because they are each authoritative in their own domain (or &quot;magisterium&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html|title=Nonoverlapping Magisteria|author=[[Stephen Jay Gould]] |date=1997|website=www.stephenjaygould.org|access-date=2016-04-06|quote=&quot;To say it for all my colleagues and for the umpteenth millionth time (from college bull sessions to learned treatises): science simply cannot (by its legitimate methods) adjudicate the issue of God's possible superintendence of nature.

You then realize that the presence of a creative deity in the universe is clearly a scientific hypothesis. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more momentous hypothesis in all of science.

God could clinch the matter in his favour at any moment by staging a spectacular demonstration of his powers, one that would satisfy the exacting standards of science. Even the infamous Templeton Foundation recognized that God is a scientific hypothesis — by funding double-blind trials to test whether remote prayer would speed the recovery of heart patients. It didn't, of course, although a control group who knew they had been prayed for tended to get worse (how about a class action suit against the Templeton Foundation?)

Some commentators have claimed that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between &quot;unaided&quot; reason and [[faith]] in &quot;[[revelation|revealed]]&quot; truths—figuratively summarized as [[Athens]] and [[Jerusalem]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Athens Met Jerusalem: An Introduction to Classical and Christian Thought|year=2009|publisher=IVP Academic|isbn=978-0-8308-2923-1|edition=58760th|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.amazon.com/Athens-Jerusalem-Lev-Shestov/dp/B0007FM164/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459965696&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=athens+and+jerusalem|title=Athens and Jerusalem|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=950|issue=1|page=17|last=Shestov|first=Lev|date=1968|bibcode=2001NYASA.950...17P|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb02124.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Strauss]] spoke of a &quot;Greater [[Western world|West]]&quot; that included all areas under the influence of the tension between Greek rationalism and [[Abrahamic]] revelation, including the [[Muslim]] lands. He was particularly influenced by the great [[Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosopher]] [[Farabi|Al-Farabi]]. To consider to what extent [[Eastern philosophy]] might have partaken of these important tensions, Strauss thought it best to consider whether [[dharma]] or [[tao]] may be equivalent to [[Nature (philosophy)|Nature]] (by which we mean ''[[physis]]'' in Greek). According to Strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the &quot;discovery or invention of nature&quot; and the &quot;pre-philosophical equivalent of nature&quot; was supplied by &quot;such notions as 'custom' or 'ways{{' &quot;}}, which appear to be ''really universal in all times and places''. The philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding ''archai'' (first principles of knowledge) brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand, and tradition or faith on the other.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Progress or Return&quot; in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is this special history of debate concerning reason and faith in the Islamic, Christian and Jewish traditions, the pursuit of reason is sometimes argued to be compatible with the other practice of other religions of a different nature, such as [[Hinduism]], because they do not define their tenets in such an absolute way.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita'', [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]]: &quot;Hinduism is not just a faith. It is the union of reason and intuition that can not be defined but is only to be experienced.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reason in particular fields of study==

===Reason in political philosophy and ethics===
{{Main|Political Philosophy|Ethics|The Good}}
[[Aristotle]] famously described reason (with language) as a part of [[human nature]], which means that it is best for humans to live &quot;politically&quot; meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small [[city state]] (''polis'' in Greek). For example...
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear, then, that a human being is more of a political [''politikon'' = of the ''polis''] animal [''zōion''] than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds. For nature, as we say, makes nothing in vain, and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech [''logos'']. Voice, of course, serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant; that is why it is also found in other animals, because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other. But speech [''logos''] serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust. For it is a peculiarity of humans, in contrast to the other animals, to have perception of good and bad, just and unjust, and the like; and the community in these things makes a household or city [''polis'']. [...] By nature, then, the drive for such a community exists in everyone, but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness. For as humans are the best of all animals when perfected, so they are the worst when divorced from law and right. The reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons, and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue, but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses. Consequently, if a human being lacks virtue, he is the most unholy and savage thing, and when it comes to sex and food, the worst. But justice is something political [to do with the ''polis''], for right is the arrangement of the political community, and right is discrimination of what is just. ([[Aristotle's Politics]] 1253a 1.2. Peter Simpson's translation, with Greek terms inserted in square brackets.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of human nature being fixed in this way, implied, in other words, that we can define what type of community is always best for people. This argument has remained a central argument in all political, ethical and moral thinking since then, and has become especially controversial since firstly [[Rousseau]]'s Second Discourse, and secondly, the [[Theory of Evolution]]. Already in Aristotle there was an awareness that the ''polis'' had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves. The household came first, and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that, with the first cities being run as if they were still families with Kings acting like fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Politics I.2.1252b15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Friendship]] [''philia''] seems to prevail [in] man and woman according to [[nature]] [''kata phusin'']; for people are by nature [''tēi phusei''] pairing [''sunduastikon''] more than political [''politikon'' = of the ''polis''], in as much as the household [''oikos''] is prior [''proteron'' = earlier] and more necessary than the ''polis'' and making children is more common [''koinoteron''] with the animals. In the other animals, community [''koinōnia''] goes no further than this, but people live together [''sumoikousin''] not only for the sake of making children, but also for the things for life; for from the start the functions [''erga''] are divided, and are different [for] man and woman. Thus they supply each other, putting their own into the common [''eis to koinon'']. It is for these [reasons] that both utility [''chrēsimon''] and pleasure [''hēdu''] seem to be found in this kind of friendship. ([[Nicomachean Ethics]], VIII.12.1162a. Rough literal translation with Greek terms shown in square brackets.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Rousseau]] in his Second Discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse: with reason, language and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems, and that once such cooperation became more important, it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation—often only to defend themselves from each other.

In other words, according to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Theory of Evolution]].

The two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because, according to the Aristotelian theory, a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau, we should even doubt that reason, language and politics are a good thing, as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today. Rousseau's theory, that human nature is malleable rather than fixed, is often taken to imply, for example by [[Karl Marx]], a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.

However, while Rousseau's initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics, including both the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical, in favor of city-states such as [[Geneva]], and [[Arcadia (utopia)|rural living]].

===Psychology===
{{Main|Psychology of reasoning}}
Scientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]]. Psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances.

Assessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is [[Rationality|rational]] or acts rationally. It is a key research question in the [[psychology of reasoning]]. [[Rationality]] is often divided into its respective [[Rationality#Theoretical and practical rationality|theoretical and practical counterparts]].

Experimental cognitive psychologists carry out research on reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as [[Intelligence tests|intelligence]] or [[IQ]] tests, or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the [[Wason test]]).&lt;ref&gt;Manktelow, K.I. 1999. ''Reasoning and Thinking (Cognitive Psychology: Modular Course.)''. Hove, Sussex:Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g., ''If A then B'' and how they make inferences about alternatives, e.g., ''A or else B''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. &amp; Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''. Hillsdale: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations, e.g., ''A is to the left of B'', or ''A happens after B'', and about quantified assertions, e.g., ''All the A are B''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. (2006). ''How we reason''. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and [[counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] situations.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. (2005). ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developmental studies of children's reasoning====
Developmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood. Piaget's [[theory of cognitive development]] was the first complete theory of reasoning development. Subsequently, several alternative theories were proposed, including the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]].&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K.F.M. van Lieshout (Eds.), Life-span developmental psychology (pp. 179–269). London: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neuroscience of reasoning====
The biological functioning of the brain is studied by [[neurophysiologist]]s and [[neuropsychologist]]s. Research in this area includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains, and of damaged or otherwise unusual brains. In addition to carrying out research into reasoning, some psychologists, for example, [[clinical psychologist]]s and [[psychotherapists]] work to alter people's reasoning habits when they are unhelpful.

===Computer science===

====Automated reasoning====
{{Main|Automated reasoning|Computational logic}}
In [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]], scientists study and use [[automated reasoning]] for diverse applications including [[automated theorem proving]] the [[formal semantics of programming languages]], and [[formal specification]] in [[software engineering]].

====Meta-reasoning====
{{Main|Metacognition}}
'''Meta-reasoning'''&lt;!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--&gt; is reasoning about reasoning.  In computer science, a system performs meta-reasoning when it is reasoning about its own operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Meta-reasoning: A Survey |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2002|volume=2408/2002|issue=65|first=Stefania |last=Costantini |doi=10.1007/3-540-45632-5_11 |pages=253–288|isbn=978-3-540-43960-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This requires a programming language capable of [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]], the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour.

===Evolution of reason===
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Capuchin monkeys sharing.jpg|thumb|right|150px| Dan Sperber believes that reasoning in groups is more effective and promotes their evolutionary fitness.]]
A species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about, predict and understand the world. French social and cognitive scientists [[Dan Sperber]] and Hugo Mercier argue that there could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. They point out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs ([[confirmation bias]]). Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective – as demonstrated by the success of projects like [[science]]. They suggest that there are not just individual, but [[group selection]] pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. Their argumentative theory of reasoning claims that reason may have more to do with winning arguments than with the search for the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1017/S0140525X10000968 |pmid = 21447233|url = https://repository.upenn.edu/goldstone/15/| volume = 34| issue = 2| pages = 57–74| last1 = Mercier| first1 = Hugo| last2 = Sperber| first2 = Dan| title = Why Do Humans Reason?

'''Pentaerythritol tetranitrate''' ('''PETN'''), also known as '''PENT''', '''PENTA''', '''TEN''', '''corpent''', or '''penthrite''' (or, rarely and primarily in German, as '''nitropenta'''), is an [[explosive material]]. It is the [[nitrate ester]] of [[pentaerythritol]], and is structurally very similar to [[nitroglycerin]]. Penta refers to the five [[carbon atom]]s of the [[neopentane]] skeleton. PETN is a powerful explosive material with a [[relative effectiveness factor]] of 1.66.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlPETN [Pentaerythritol tetranitrate]&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/explosives-nitrate-petn.htm |title=PETN (Pentaerythritol tetranitrate) |accessdate=March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mixed with a [[plasticizer]], PETN forms a [[plastic explosive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Explosives | encyclopedia = A dictionary of military history and the art of war | last= Childs| first= John | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nEQ7FUAdmc8C&amp;pg=PA231 | format = [[Google Books]] extract | isbn = 978-0-631-16848-5 | year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[RDX]] it is the main ingredient of [[Semtex]].

==History==
Pentaerythritol tetranitrate was first prepared and patented in 1894 by the explosives manufacturer Rheinisch-Westfälische Sprengstoff A.G. of Cologne, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsches Reichspatent 81,664 (1894)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thieme, Bruno [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00541899&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D0541,899.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F0541,899%2526RS%3DPN%2F0541,899&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page &quot;Process of making nitropentaerythrit,&quot;] U.S. patent no. 541,899 (filed:  November 13, 1894 ; issued:  July 2, 1895).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krehl, Peter O. K. (2009) ''History of Shock Waves, Explosions and Impact''. Berlin, Germany: Springer-Verlag. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PmuqCHDC3pwC&amp;pg=PA405#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 405].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urbański, Tadeusz; Ornaf, Władysław and Laverton, Sylvia (1965) ''Chemistry and Technology of Explosives'', vol. 2 (Oxford, England:  Permagon Press. [https://archive.org/stream/ChemistryAndTechnologyOfExplosives-VolumeIi/ChemistryAndTechnologyOfExplosives-VolumeIi-TadeuszUrbanski#page/n183/mode/2up p. 175.]
&lt;/ref&gt; The production of PETN started in 1912, when the improved method of production was patented by the German government. PETN was used by the German Military in {{nowrap|[[World War I]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;German Patent 265,025 (1912)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Die Schiess- und Sprengstoffe|author = Stettbacher, Alfred |place = Leipzig |publisher= Barth|year = 1933| page= 459| edition = 2. völlig umgearb. Aufl. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in the MG FF/M autocannons and many other weapon systems of the Luftwaffe in World War II, specifically in the high explosive [[Mine shell]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Properties==
PETN is practically [[solubility|insoluble]] in water (0.01&amp;nbsp;g/100&amp;nbsp;ml at 50&amp;nbsp;°C), weakly soluble in common nonpolar [[solvent]]s such as [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic hydrocarbon]]s (like gasoline) or [[Carbon tetrachloride|tetrachloromethane]], but soluble in some other organic solvents, particularly in [[acetone]] (about 15&amp;nbsp;g/100&amp;nbsp;g of the solution at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, 55&amp;nbsp;g/100&amp;nbsp;g at 60&amp;nbsp;°C) and [[dimethylformamide]] (40&amp;nbsp;g/100&amp;nbsp;g of the solution at 40&amp;nbsp;°C, 70&amp;nbsp;g/100&amp;nbsp;g at 70&amp;nbsp;°C). PETN forms [[eutectic system|eutectic]] mixtures with some liquid or molten [[aromaticity|aromatic]] [[nitro compound]]s, ''e.g.'' [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) or [[tetryl]]. Due to steric hindrance of the adjacent neopentyl-like moiety, PETN is resistant to attack by many chemical [[reagent]]s; it does not [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] in water at room temperature or in weaker [[alkalinity|alkaline]] [[aqueous solution]]s. Water at 100&amp;nbsp;°C or above causes [[hydrolysis]] to dinitrate; presence of 0.1% [[nitric acid]] accelerates the reaction.

The [[chemical stability]] of PETN is of interest, because of the presence of PETN in aging weapons. A review has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Aging of Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate (PETN) | url = https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/372573.pdf | author = Foltz, M.

[[Gamma radiation]] increases the [[thermal decomposition]] sensitivity of PETN, lowers melting point by few degrees Celsius, and causes swelling of the samples. Like other nitrate esters, the primary [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] mechanism is the loss of [[nitrogen dioxide]]; this reaction is [[autocatalytic]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Studies were performed on [[thermal decomposition]] of PETN.&lt;ref&gt;German, V.N. et al.

Institute of Physics of Explosion,  RFNC-VNIIEF, Sarov, Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

In the environment, PETN undergoes [[biodegradation]]. Some bacteria denitrate PETN to trinitrate and then dinitrate, which is then further degraded.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} PETN has low [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] and low solubility in water, and therefore has low [[bioavailability]] for most organisms. Its [[toxicity]] is relatively low, and its [[transdermal]] absorption also seems to be low.&lt;ref name=army1/&gt; It poses a threat for aquatic [[organism]]s. It can be degraded to pentaerythritol by [[iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es7029703|title=Degradation of Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate (PETN) by Granular Iron|journal=[[Environ. Sci. Technol.]]|year=2008|volume=42|pages=4534–9|pmid=18605582|issue=12|last1=Zhuang|first1=L|last2=Gui|first2=L|last3=Gillham|first3=R. W.|bibcode=2008EnST...42.4534Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

Production is by the reaction of [[pentaerythritol]] with concentrated [[nitric acid]] to form a precipitate which can be recrystallized from acetone to give processable crystals.&lt;ref name = Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a10_143.pub2 | title = Explosives | author = Boileau, Jacques; Fauquignon, Claude; Hueber, Bernard and Meyer, Hans H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations of a method first published in US Patent 2,370,437 by Acken and Vyverberg (1945 to Du Pont) form the basis of all current commercial production.

PETN is manufactured by numerous manufacturers as a powder, or together with [[nitrocellulose]] and [[plasticizer]] as thin plasticized sheets (e.g. [[Primasheet]] 1000 or [[Detasheet]]). PETN residues are easily detectable in hair of people handling it.&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Ron. (December 29, 2009) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126195987401406861 A Primer in PETN – WSJ.com]. ''The Wall Street Journal''.

==Explosive use==

[[File:Pentryt.jpg|thumbnail|Pentaerythritol tetranitrate before crystallization from acetone]]

The most common use of PETN is as an explosive with high [[brisance]]. It is more difficult to detonate than [[primary explosive]]s, so dropping or igniting it will typically not cause an explosion (at [[atmospheric pressure]] it is difficult to ignite and burns relatively slowly), but is more sensitive to shock and friction than other secondary explosives such as TNT or [[tetryl]].&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/us/28explosives.html?ref=us|title=Explosive on Flight 253 Is Among Most Powerful |newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 27, 2009|author=Chang, Kenneth }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under certain conditions a [[deflagration to detonation transition]] can occur.

===Final years at the Boleyn (2005–2016)===

West Ham lost the shootout, but nonetheless gained entry to the following season's [[2006–07 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] as Liverpool had already qualified for the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. In August 2006, West Ham completed a major coup on the last day of the transfer window after completing the signings of [[Carlos Tevez]] and [[Javier Mascherano]].&lt;ref name=&quot;West Ham sign Tevez &amp; Mascherano&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = West Ham sign Tevez &amp; Mascherano

The signings of Mascherano and Tevez were investigated by the Premier League, who were concerned that details of the transfers had been omitted from official records. The club was found guilty and fined £5.5&amp;nbsp;million in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huggins|first1=Trevor|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-westham-fapl/west-ham-given-record-fine-over-transfers-idUKL2744414120070427|title=West Ham given record fine over transfers|work=Reuters|date=27 April 2007|access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, West Ham avoided a points deduction which ultimately became critical in their avoidance of relegation at the end of the [[2006–07 Premier League|2006–07 season]].

In the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08 season]], West Ham remained reasonably consistently in the top half of the league table, with [[Freddie Ljungberg]] in the team, despite a slew of injuries; new signing [[Craig Bellamy]] missed most of the campaign, while [[Kieron Dyer]] was out from August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/7257001.stm | title=Injured Bellamy out for six weeks | work=BBC Sport | date=21 February 2008 | access-date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/happy-returns-making-a-comeback-from-a-lengthy-layoff-2359159.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=2 | title=Happy returns?

It was a five-place improvement on the previous season, and most importantly West Ham were never under any realistic threat of relegation.

After a row with the board over the sale of defenders [[Anton Ferdinand]] and [[George McCartney]] to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], manager Alan Curbishley resigned on 3 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/7596106.stm | title=Curbishley quits as West Ham boss | work=BBC Sport | access-date=7 October 2013 | date=3 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor was former Chelsea striker [[Gianfranco Zola]], who took over on 11 September 2008 to become the club's first non-British manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;zola1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/11/westham.zola|title=West Ham unveil Zola as new manager|date=11 September 2008|work=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=12 September 2008  | first=John | last=Ashdown}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09 season]], West Ham finished ninth, a single place improvement.

Following Manchester United's win in the [[2016 FA Cup Final]], West Ham took their Europa League place and qualified for the third qualifying round of the [[2016–17 UEFA Europa League|2016–17 edition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;europe201617&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2016/May/21-May/Hammers-qualify-for-UEFA-Europa-League | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524190640/http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2016/May/21-May/Hammers-qualify-for-UEFA-Europa-League | url-status=dead | archive-date=24 May 2016 | title=Hammers qualify for UEFA Europa League | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | date=21 May 2016 | access-date=22 May 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the tough [[2016–17 Premier League|first season at the London Stadium]], the team finished 11th, along with having to deal with the departure of star man [[Dimitri Payet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11685/10887457/west-ham-201617-premier-league-season-review|title=West Ham 2016/17 Premier League season review|access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the team suffered a poor start to the following season, taking only two wins in their opening 11 games. Following a 4–1 defeat to Liverpool at home and with the team threatened by relegation, Bilić was sacked on 6 November 2017. He was replaced by former Sunderland boss [[David Moyes]] on a contract till the end of the season. The team battled inconsistent form for the rest of the season but managed to avoid relegation and finish 13th. Moyes was not offered a new contract and left the club on the expiration of it on 16 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2776278-david-moyes-departs-west-ham-after-expiration-of-his-contract|title=David Moyes Departs West Ham After Expiration of His Contract|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2018, the club appointed former [[Manchester City]] boss [[Manuel Pellegrini]] as the new manager on a three-year deal contract.&lt;ref name=WestHamIn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44163423 |title=West Ham: Manuel Pellegrini named new manager at London Stadium |work=BBC Sport |date=22 May 2018 |access-date=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season in charge, the Hammers finished 10th, once again suffering from inconsistent form. However, after a poor first half to the following season, Pellegrini was sacked in December 2019 with the team only one point above the relegation zone. His last game in charge was a 2–1 home loss to Leicester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2019/december/28-december/west-ham-united-statement|title=West Ham United statement &amp;#124; West Ham United|website=www.whufc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by David Moyes, who returned for a second spell in charge a day later.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11685/11897082/west-ham-re-appoint-david-moyes-on-18-month-deal&lt;/ref&gt;

During the end of the 2010s, discontent grew within the club's support over the ownership of the club by [[David Sullivan (businessman)|David Sullivan]], [[David Gold (businessman)|David Gold]]'s ownership of the club.

===Thames Ironworks FC===
The Thames Ironworks Team (1895–1900) used the [[Union Flag]] as its badge.

===Rivet Hammers===
The principal element of the badge is the crossed pair of rivet hammers, tools that were used in the shipbuilding industry. The [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]] and [[Canning Town]] neighbourhoods surrounding the [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] echoed to the sound of hammers; [[steam hammer]]s, sledge hammers and rivet hammers.&lt;ref&gt;The shipbuilding description that follows comes from Brian Belton's book 'The Thames Ironworks' Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Seven large mechanical steam hammers would punch small holes near the edges of the iron plates which would be joined to build the ships. The plates would be put in place and fixed together with rivets by teams of five, three inside the emerging vessel and two outside.
 
Inside the ship one member of the team would heat the rivets till they were white hot and, using ''Iron Fingers'' ([[blacksmith|blacksmith’s]] [[tongs]]), throw them to a second person known as a 'catch-boy' or 'putter-in' who would pick the rivet up and place it the hole, also using tongs. The third person was known as the 'holder-on' and he would then smash the rivet home with a sixteen-pound sledge hammer and then use his sledgehammer to hold the rivet in place while the men on the other side flattened the other end of the rivet.
 
Outside the ship, exposed to the elements, two men with rivet hammers – one right-handed, one left-handed – would hammer the protruding and still glowing rivet flat, so securing one of the many points necessary to link each of the ship's large plates.

The crossed hammers were also incorporated into the coat of arms of the [[County Borough of West Ham]] and those of its successor, the modern [[London Borough of Newham]].&lt;ref&gt;Archived material from LB of Newham website, description of each element of the coat of arms https://web.archive.org/web/20130602073325/http://apps.newham.gov.uk/democracy/civicamb/carms.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tower===
A yellow or white tower was added, intermittently, from the 1950s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;website shows much of the evolution of the badge http://theyflysohigh.co.uk/club-crest/4548286338&lt;/ref&gt; The primary reason for this seems to be to represent ''Anne Boleyn’s Tower'', the most notable feature of [[Green Street House]], an originally Tudor group of buildings which stood next to the [[Boleyn Ground]] until demolished in 1955. [[Green Street House]] was also known as ''Boleyn Castle'' through an association with [[Anne Boleyn]]. The manor was reputedly one of the sites at which [[Henry VIII]] courted his second queen, though there is no documentary evidence to support the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=42741 | title=East Ham: Manors and estates | publisher=University of London &amp; History of Parliament Trust | author=Various | access-date=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of other factors which may have influenced the inclusion of the stylised castle feature, for instance:
* to reflect the contribution made to the club by players of [[Old Castle Swifts]] 
* The imposing towers, rooves and doorway of the Engineering Department of the [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] bore a strong resemblance&lt;ref&gt;link to external image https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/images/0/02/Im1895EnV80-p567.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; to the castle feature in earlier iterations of the badge.
* The first verse of the club's anthem [[I'm forever blowing bubbles]] begins &quot;I'm dreaming dreams, I'm scheming schemes, I'm building castles high&quot;.
* The [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] of the [[Tower of London]] as emblematic of [[East London]]. For hundreds of years, up until 1900, inner [[East London]] had been known as the [[Tower division|Tower Division]],&lt;ref&gt;The London Encyclopaedia, 1983, by Weinreb and Hibbert. The Encyclopaedia describes how the creation of the Tower Division, aka Tower Hamlets, made East London a distinct military unit&lt;/ref&gt; an area which owed military service to the [[Tower of London]]. The (originally whitewashed) [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] was used as insignia for the area, for instance on cap badges of local units of the army.
* In recognition of the ‘West Ham Pals’, the 13th Battalion of the [[Essex Regiment]] which was raised in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] in 1915 and saw extensive action and heavy losses on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the [[World War I]]. The Battalion was formed from volunteers from [[West Ham]] and [[East London]] generally. Their [[battle cry|war cry]] was “Up the Hammers”. The cap badge of the [[Essex Regiment]] was the castle and key of Gibraltar, though the unit made an unsuccessful request to the [[War Office]] that crossed hammers could be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Up the Hammers&quot; The West Ham Battalion in the Great War 1914–1918, by Elliot Taylor andBarney Alston.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The adoption (in 1904) of Boleyn Castle FC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/hilsdon.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013213249/http://eastlondonhistory.com/hilsdon.htm | archive-date=13 October 2007 | title=&quot;Gatling Gun&quot; George Hildson | publisher=Football Lives | author=Colm Kerrigan| isbn=978-0-9530718-0-7| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the club's reserve side when they took over their grounds on the site.

===Shield===
A shield has been used in many iterations of the club badge, and the shape of the 2016 version matches the cross-section on the hull of [[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS Warrior]], the most famous ship built by the Thames Ironworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hopps |first1=Kat |title=How a new West Ham United crest is keeping strong links between the football club and HMS Warrior |url=https://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/heritage/how-a-new-west-ham-united-crest-is-keeping-strong-links-between-the-football-club-and-hms-warrior-1-4346169 |website=Newham Recorder |access-date=19 July 2020 |date=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However examining draughtsman's diagrams&lt;ref&gt;Draughtsman's diagram of the hull of the warrior https://d32ptomnhiuevv.cloudfront.net/en-gb/sites/default/files/product_jackets/Haynes-H6106-page-5_0.jpg {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410072942/https://d32ptomnhiuevv.cloudfront.net/en-gb/sites/default/files/product_jackets/Haynes-H6106-page-5_0.jpg |date=10 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the ship casts doubt on the resemblance between the shield and the ship.

===Iterations===
The crest was redesigned and updated in the late 1990s, featuring a wider yellow castle with fewer cruciform &quot;windows&quot; along with the peaked roofs being removed; the tops of the towers had previously made the castle appear more akin to [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]'s Sleeping Beauty's Castle than a functioning fortress. The designer also altered other details to give a more substantial feel to the iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Ham|url=http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/the-clubs/west-ham|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405014018/http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/the-clubs/west-ham|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 April 2010|publisher=premierskills|access-date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the club rebuilt the west stand of the [[Boleyn Ground]] (construction finished 2001–02) the &quot;castle&quot; from the redesigned badge was incorporated into the structure at the main entrance to the ground. A pair of towers were prominent features of the ground's appearance, both bearing large club badges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Ham|url=http://www.footballbadgesguide.com/West%20Ham.html|publisher=Footballbadgesguide|access-date=3 October 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212837/http://www.footballbadgesguide.com/West%20Ham.html|archive-date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new badge was introduced following the end of the [[2015–16 West Ham United F.C. season|2015–16 season]], when the club moved into the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=West Ham: Hammers fans vote in favour of new club crest|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28261889|access-date=17 July 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It removes the Boleyn Castle due to the club moving away, leaving just the crossed hammers, which the club says is inspired by the crest before and during the career of [[Bobby Moore]]. The word &quot;London&quot; was introduced below to &quot;establish the club firmly on the international stage&quot;, and the more minimalist approach is to give a &quot;strong statement that is instantly West Ham United&quot;. The shape of the crest is that of the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] of {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}, the first [[ironclad warship]] in the [[Royal Navy]], which was built by [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We will always be West Ham United|url=http://www.whufc.com/staticFiles/c2/c2/0,,12562~180930,00.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726193724/http://www.whufc.com/staticFiles/c2/c2/0%2C%2C12562~180930%2C00.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 July 2014|publisher=West Ham United F.C.|access-date=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colours==
The original colours of the team were dark blue, due to [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] chairman [[Arnold Hills]] being a former student of Oxford University (see [[Oxford Blue (colour)|Oxford blue]]). However, the team used a variety of kits including the claret and sky blue house colours of Thames Ironworks, as well as sky blue or white kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kitclassics.co.uk/kits/westham.gif | title=West Ham kits since inception I | publisher=Various sources, image of kits | author=kitclassics.co.uk | access-date=15 August 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625144306/http://www.kitclassics.co.uk/kits/westham.gif| archive-date = 25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/West_Ham_United/West_Ham_United.htm | title=West Ham kits since inception II| publisher=Various sources, images of kits | author=Dave Moor | access-date=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irons permanently adopted claret and blue for home colours in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://theyflysohigh.co.uk/playing-kit-1900-1999/4547927422| title=Playing Kit: West Ham United 1900 to 1999| last=Marsh| first=Steve| website=theyflysohigh.co.uk| access-date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One story suggests that [[Thames Ironworks F.C.|Thames Ironworks]] right-half [[Charlie Dove]] received the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] kit from William Belton, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Belton had been at a fair in [[Birmingham]], close to [[Villa Park]], the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that one of them would win. Belton defeated them and, when they were unable to pay the bet, one of the Villa players who was responsible for washing the team's kit offered a complete team's &quot;football kits&quot; to Belton in payment. The Aston Villa player subsequently reported to his club that the kit was &quot;missing.&quot;{{sfn|Belton|2006|pages=2–4}} This, however, is often disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Myths and Legends |first=Steve |last=Marsh |work=theyflysohigh.co.uk |access-date=16 December 2018 |url= http://theyflysohigh.co.uk/myths-and-legends/4593203735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thames Ironworks, and later West Ham United, retained the claret yoke/blue sleeves design, but also continued to use their previously favoured colours for their away kits.

The team's supporters are famous for their rendition of the chorus of their team's anthem, &quot;[[I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles]]&quot; introduced to the club by former manager Charlie Paynter in the late 1920s. A [[Pears soap]] commercial featuring the curly haired child in the [[John Everett Millais|Millais]]' &quot;[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]&quot; was well known at the time. The child resembled a player, Billy J. &quot;Bubbles&quot; Murray, from local schoolboy team, Park School, where the headmaster was Cornelius Beal. Beal was known locally for his music and rhyme and wrote special words to the tune of &quot;I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles&quot; whenever any player was having a good game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bubbles1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20071017/the-story-of-bubbles_2240257_1193983|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528221016/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20071017/the-story-of-bubbles_2240257_1193983|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 May 2010|title=The Story of Bubbles|publisher=West Ham United F.C.|author=John Helliar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beal was a friend of Paynter, while Murray was a West Ham trialist and played football at schoolboy level with a number of West Ham players such as [[Jim Barrett, Sr.|Jim Barrett]]. Through this contrivance of association the club's fans took it upon themselves to begin singing the popular music hall tune before home games, sometimes reinforced by the presence of a house band requested to play the refrain by Charlie Paynter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bubbles2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/claret/?page_id=3595 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218021240/http://www.whufc.com/claret/?page_id=3595 |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 February 2006 |title=The Story of Bubbles |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |author=John Helliar  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canio to the tune of [[Ottawan]]'s &quot;[[D.I.S.C.O.]]&quot;, or the chant of &quot;Who Let The Potts Out?&quot; to the tune of [[Baha Men]]'s &quot;[[Who Let the Dogs Out?]]&quot; when [[Steve Potts (footballer)|Steve Potts]] could be seen warming up to come on as substitute late on in his career, or &quot;That's Zamora&quot; to the tune of [[Dean Martin]]'s 1953 &quot;[[That's Amore]]&quot; in honour of former striker [[Bobby Zamora]]. Other former players to be serenaded include [[Christian Dailly]] with vastly-altered lyrics to [[Frankie Valli]]'s &quot;[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fanchants.com/football-songs/west_ham-chants/christian-dailly/| title=&quot;Oh Christian Dailly&quot; lyrics | publisher=fanchants.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Cole]] and [[Carlton Cole]] with [[Spandau Ballet]]'s &quot;[[Gold (Spandau Ballet song)|Gold]]&quot; song title sung as &quot;Cole&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/nov/28/sport.arts | title=R Kelly sings the Blues | work=The Guardian | location=London |date=28 November 2005 | access-date=8 October 2013 | author=de Lisle, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luděk Mikloško]].

When the players come onto the pitch, and at other times of celebration, as the song ''I'm forever blowing bubbles'' is being sung, around 60 bubble machines produce copious bubbles that rise high into the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://meninblazers.com/2017/09/22/bubbles/ |title = JW Goes Behind the Bubbles at West Ham United with &quot;Mickey Bubbles&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fans gained national attention after giving a torrid time to [[David Beckham]] in his first away match of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on [[Diego Simeone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/156542.stm |title=Beckham runs gauntlet at West Ham |work=BBC Sport  | date=29 August 1998 | access-date=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with the game, there were claims (and an image taken) that fans, organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy of the player outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in [[South East (London sub region)|South-East London]], the heartland of West Ham's greatest rivals [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckham's every touch of the ball during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/events/1998/worldcup/news/1998/07/14/beckham_safety/|title=Beckham still subject of fans' ire | publisher=CNN – Sports Illustrated | date=19 September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hooliganism===
The origins of West Ham's links with [[Football hooliganism|organised football-related violence]] starts in the 1960s with the establishment of The [[Mile End]] Mob (named after an area of the East End of London).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.casspennant.com/book-aggro.shtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314024542/http://www.casspennant.com/book-aggro.shtml | url-status=dead | archive-date=14 March 2010 | title=Want Some Aggro? | publisher=casspennant.com | access-date=5 October 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s and 1980s (the main era for organised football-related violence), West Ham gained further notoriety for the levels of hooliganism in their fan base and antagonistic behaviour towards both their own and rival fans, and the police. During the 1970s in particular, rival groups of West Ham fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each other at games, most often groups from the neighbouring districts of [[Barking, London|Barking]] and [[Dagenham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CassPennant&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=CONFESSIONS OF A TERRACE LEGEND The fights, the politics, the rival firms: Cass Pennant, notorious founder member of West Ham's InterCity Firm, recalls hooliganism's heyday.|url=http://www.casspennant.com/news.php?8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314030123/http://www.casspennant.com/news.php?8|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 March 2010|publisher=CassPennant|access-date=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inter City Firm]] were one of the first &quot;[[Casual (subculture)|casuals]]&quot;, so called because they avoided police supervision by not wearing football-related clothing and travelled to away matches on regular [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] trains, rather than on the cheap and more tightly policed &quot;football special&quot; charter trains. The group were an infamous West Ham-aligned gang. As the firm's moniker &quot;inter city&quot; suggests violent activities were not confined to local derbies – the hooligans were content to cause trouble at any game, though nearby teams often bore the brunt.&lt;ref name=&quot;CassPennant&quot;/&gt;

The 2005 independent film ''[[Green Street (film)|Green Street]]'' starring [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Charlie Hunnam]] focuses on a firm of West Ham hooligans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=My guilty pleasure: Green Street |last=Hann |first=Michael |work=The Guardian |date=24 March 2014 |access-date=6 January 2019 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/mar/24/my-guilty-pleasure-green-street}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalries===
{{See also|Millwall F.C.–West Ham United F.C. rivalry|London derby|East London derby}}
West Ham have strong rivalries with several other clubs. Most of these are with other London clubs, especially with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in an East versus North London derby&lt;ref name=localrivals&gt;{{cite news|last=Hytner|first=David|title=Scott Parker completes m switch to Tottenham from West Ham|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/31/tottenham-west-ham-scott-parker|access-date=13 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in an East versus West London rivalry. The rivalry between West Ham and Tottenham has been fuelled by players such as [[Michael Carrick]], [[Martin Peters]], [[Paul Allen (footballer)|Paul Allen]], [[Jermain Defoe]] and [[Scott Parker]] leaving the Hammers to join Tottenham. The rivalry deepened with the appointment of former Hammers manager [[Harry Redknapp]] as Tottenham's manager.&lt;ref name=bung&gt;{{cite news|title=Give Harry Redknapp due respect, Frank Lampard Sr tells West Ham fans|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/3660235/Give-Harry-Redknapp-due-respect-Frank-Lampard-Sr-tells-West-Ham-fans-Football.html|access-date=13 November 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=7 December 2008|location=London|first=John|last=Ley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[2006–07 FA Premier League|2006–07 Premier League season]], West Ham have developed a strong rivalry with [[Yorkshire]] club [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] due to the dubious circumstances surrounding the transfer of [[Carlos Tevez]], who helped West Ham avoid relegation at Sheffield United's expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Neil McLeman |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/west-ham-still-owe-sheffield-1269811 |title=West Ham still owe Sheffield United more than m over Carlos Tevez fiasco |work=Daily Mirror|date=19 August 2012 |access-date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox |first=Norman |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/jagielka-intensifies-bitter-rivalry-to-raise-pressure-on-pardew-6153527.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226174931/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/jagielka-intensifies-bitter-rivalry-to-raise-pressure-on-pardew-6153527.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 February 2014 |title=Jagielka intensifies bitter rivalry to raise pressure on Pardew |work=The Independent |date=31 January 2005 |access-date=3 January 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest and fiercest [[Millwall F.C.–West Ham United F.C. rivalry|rivalry]] is with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. The two sides are local rivals, having both formed originally around local companies, with players living in the same localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling [[The Football League|Football League]] while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which [[Isle of Dogs]]-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West Ham fans.&lt;ref name=Rivalry1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/a-rivalry-that-dates-back-to-the-heyday-of-british-shipbuilding-1777732.html |title=A rivalry that dates back to the heyday of British shipbuilding |work=The Independent |location=London |date=27 August 2009 |access-date=26 June 2011  | first=Chris | last=Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry between West Ham and Millwall has involved considerable violence and is one of the most notorious within the world of [[football hooliganism]]. The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the [[2009–10 Football League Cup|2009–10 League Cup]] and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. [[2009 Upton Park riots|Clashes]] between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to half a mile away from the stadium, with serious injuries, including the stabbing of a Millwall supporter, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8221451.stm |title=Violence erupts at London derby |work=BBC News|access-date=25 August 2009 | date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, West Ham were fined after being found guilty of violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8443013.stm| title=West Ham fined £115,000 over violence against Millwall| work=BBC Sport| date=15 January 2010| access-date=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2016, West Ham were based at the [[Boleyn Ground]], commonly known as Upton Park, in [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], East London. The capacity of the Boleyn Ground was 35,016,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/page/StadiumInformation/0,,12562,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110235510/http://www.whufc.com/page/StadiumInformation/0%2C%2C12562%2C00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 November 2007 |title=Stadium Information |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |access-date=29 April 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been West Ham's ground since 1904. Prior to this, in their previous incarnation of [[Thames Ironworks F.C.|Thames Ironworks]], they played at [[Hermit Road]] in [[Canning Town]] and briefly at [[Browning Road]] in [[East Ham]], before moving to the [[Memorial Grounds]] in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]] in 1897. They retained the stadium during their transition to becoming West Ham United and were there for a further four seasons before moving to the Boleyn Ground in 1904.

Former chairman [[Eggert Magnússon]] made clear his ambition for West Ham to move to the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]] after the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold and Sullivan when they assumed control of the club stating that they felt it was a logical move for the Government as it was in the borough of Newham.

In February 2010, however, the British Olympic Minister stated that West Ham would not get the stadium, and it would instead be used for track and field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-ham/7027066/David-Sullivan-admits-West-Ham-buy-out-makes-no-commercial-sense.html |title=David Sullivan admits West Ham buy-out 'makes no commercial sense' |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 January 2010 | location=London | first1=Steve | last1=Wilson | access-date=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 May 2010, West Ham and [[Newham London Borough Council]] submitted a formal plan to the Olympic Park Legacy Company for the use of the Olympic Stadium following the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. The proposal was for a stadium with a capacity of 60,000 which would retain a competition athletics track. The proposal was welcomed by the chairman of UK athletics, Ed Warner, who said, &quot;I think it will feel great as a football stadium and I speak as a football fan as well the chairman of UK Athletics. I think you'd find West Ham would cover the track in the winter season so it wouldn't look like you had a track between you and the pitch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100517/olympic-stadium-proposal-submitted_2236884_2053629 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519131459/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100517/olympic-stadium-proposal-submitted_2236884_2053629 |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 May 2010 |title=Olympic Stadium proposal submitted |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |access-date=18 May 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/8670638.stm |title=UK Athletics boss Ed Warner boosts West Ham's 2012 plan |work=BBC Sport  |date=9 May 2010 |access-date=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

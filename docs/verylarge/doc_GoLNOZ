As noted above, this hypothesis was supported in a statistical analysis of the ''Trichoplax adhaerens'' whole genome sequence in comparison to the whole genome sequences of six other animals and two related non-animal species.&lt;ref name=genome/&gt;

===Eumetazoa hypothesis===
A third hypothesis, based primarily on molecular genetics, views the Placozoa as highly simplified eumetazoans. According to this, ''Trichoplax adhaerens'' is descended from considerably more complex animals that already had muscles and nerve tissues. Both tissue types, as well as the basal lamina of the epithelium, were accordingly lost more recently by radical secondary simplification.

Various studies in this regard so far yield differing results for identifying the exact sister group: in one case the Placozoa would qualify as the nearest relatives of the Cnidaria, while in another they would be a sister group to the Ctenophora, and occasionally they are placed directly next to the Bilateria. Currently, they are typically placed according to the cladogram below:

{{clade|label1=[[Metazoa]]|1=
  {{clade|1=[[Porifera]]|label2=[[Eumetazoa]] / [[Diploblast]]s / [[Epitheliozoa]]
|2={{clade
|1=[[Ctenophora]]
|label2=[[ParaHoxozoa]]
|2={{clade
|1=Placozoa
|label2=[[Planulozoa]]
|2=
       {{clade|[[Cnidaria]]|[[Bilateria]] / [[Bilateria|Triploblasts]]}}
     }}
   }}
  }}
}}

In this cladogram the Epitheliozoa and Eumetazoa are synonyms to each other and to the Diploblasts, and the Ctenophora are basal to them.

An argument raised against the proposed scenario is that it leaves morphological features of the animals completely out of consideration. The extreme degree of simplification that would have to be postulated for the Placozoa in this model, moreover, is known only for parasitic organisms but would be difficult to explain functionally in a free-living species like ''Trichoplax adhaerens''.

This version is supported by statistical analysis of the ''Trichoplax adhaerens'' whole genome sequence in comparison to the whole genome sequences of six other animals and two related non-animal species. However, ctenophora was not included in the analyses, placing the placozoas outside of the sampled Eumetazoans.&lt;ref name=genome/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wallberg|first1=Andreas|last2=Thollesson|first2=Mikael|last3=Farris|first3=James S.|last4=Jondelius|first4=Ulf|date=2004-12-01|title=The phylogenetic position of the comb jellies (Ctenophora) and the importance of taxonomic sampling|journal=Cladistics|language=en|volume=20|issue=6|pages=558–578|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2004.00041.x|s2cid=86185156|issn=1096-0031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Symbion''''' is the name of a [[genus]] of [[Commensalism|commensal]] aquatic animals, less than 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm wide, found living attached to the mouthparts of cold-water lobsters. They have sac-like bodies, and three distinctly different forms in different parts of their two-stage life-cycle. They appear so different from other animals that they were assigned their own, new [[phylum]] '''Cycliophora''' shortly after they were discovered in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18834-zoologger-the-most-bizarre-life-story-on-earth/ |title=Zoologger: The most bizarre life story on Earth? |last=Marshall |first=Michael |date=28 April 2010 |website=New Scientist |access-date=19 November 2018 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;In 1995, Peter Funch and Reinhardt Møbjerg Kristensen, both then at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, discovered an animal so unlike any other that a new phylum – Cycliophora – had to be created just for it.&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first new [[phylum]] of multicelled organism to be discovered since the [[Loricifera]] in 1983.

'''''Symbion''''' was discovered in 1995 by [[Reinhardt Kristensen]] and [[Peter Funch]]&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P. Funch  |author2=R. M.

* the [[European lobster]] (''Homarus gammarus'', host to an as yet unnamed species of ''Symbion'')

The genus is so named because of its [[Commensalism|commensal relationship]] with the lobster (a form of [[symbiosis]]) &amp;ndash; it feeds on the leftovers from the lobster's own meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P. Funch |author2=P. Thor  |author3=M. Obst  |name-list-style=amp |year=2008 |title=Symbiotic relations and feeding biology of ''Symbion pandora'' (Cycliophora) and ''Triticella flava'' (Bryozoa) |journal=[[Vie et Milieu]] |volume=58 |pages=185–188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[genus]] '''''Symbion''''' are peculiar microscopic [[animal]]s, with no obvious close relatives, and which was therefore given its own [[phylum (biology)|phylum]], called '''Cycliophora'''. The phylogenetic position of ''Symbion'' remains unclear: originally the phyla [[Ectoprocta]] and [[Entoprocta]] were considered possible relatives of ''Symbion'', based on structural similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eol.org/pages/1922/details|title=Cycliophorans - Cycliophora - Details - Encyclopedia of Life|website=Encyclopedia of Life|language=en|access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, genetic studies suggest that ''Symbion'' may be more closely related to [[Gnathifera (phylum)|Gnathifera]].

== Description ==
''Symbion pandora'' has a [[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral]], sac-like body with no [[body cavity|coelom]]. There are three basic life stages:

* '''Asexual Feeding Stage''' &amp;ndash; At this stage, ''S. pandora'' is neither male nor female. It has a length of 347&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] and a width of 113&amp;nbsp;μm. On the posterior end of the sac-like body is a stalk with an adhesive disc, which attaches itself to the host. On the anterior end is a ciliated funnel (mouth) and an anus.
* '''Sexual Stage'''
** '''Male''' &amp;ndash; ''S. pandora'' has a length of 84&amp;nbsp;μm and a width of 42&amp;nbsp;μm during this stage. It has no mouth or anus, which signifies the absence of a [[digestive system]]. It also has two reproductive organs.
** '''Female''' &amp;ndash; ''S. pandora'' is the same size as the male in this stage. It does, however, have a digestive system which collapses and reconstitutes itself as a [[larva]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;/&gt;

== Reproduction ==
''Symbion'' reproduce both [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] and sexually, and has a complex reproduction cycle, a strategy evolved to produce as many offspring as possible that can survive and find a new host when the lobster they live on sheds its shell. The asexual individuals are the largest ones. The sexual individuals doesn't eat. During fall they make copies of themselves, where a new individual grows inside the parent body, one offspring at the time. The new offspring attach themselves to an available spot on the lobster, begins to feed and eventually start making new copies of themselves. 
In early winter, the asexual animals starts producing males. When the male is born, it crawls away from the parent and glue itself to another asexual individual. Once attached, the male produce two dwarf males inside its body, which turns into a hollow pouch. Each of the two dwarf males are about hundred times smaller than the asexual individual they are attached to, and their body starts out with about 200 cells, but this number has been reduced to just 47 by the time they reach maturity. 34 of the cells form its nervous system, and three more becomes sensory cells used to help them feel their surroundings. Eight cells becomes mucus glands, which produce mucus that helps them move across the surface. The final two cells form the testes, which make the sperm that fertilize the female’s egg. Most of the cells of the dwarf males also lose their nucleus, and make them shrink to almost half their size, which is an adaptation that allows two mature individuals to fit inside the body of the parent male. Two males increases the chances to fertilize a female. 
By late winter, when the large feeding individuals in the colony have males attached to their bodies, they start making females. Each female has a single egg inside them. When she is about the be born, one of the two dwarf males fertilize her when she comes out. The fertilized female find herself a place on the host's whiskers where she attach herself. Inside her the developing embryo extracts all the nutrients it needs to grow from its mother, and by the time it is ready to be born, all that remains of the mother is an empty husk. This new offspring is a strong swimmer unlike all the other forms in the colony, and those who succeeds in finding a new host will attach themselves to its mouthparts, where it will grow a stomach and mouthparts, morphing into a large, feeding and asexual type, starting the cycle all over again.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/living-mysteries-complex-beast-lurks-lobster-whiskers Living Mysteries: This complex beast lurks on lobster whiskers]&lt;/ref&gt;
The larval stage may be unscientifically referred to as sea worms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''echinoderm''' {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|k|aɪ|n|oʊ|d|ɜr|m}} is any member of the [[phylum]] '''Echinodermata''' {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˌ|k|aɪ|n|oʊ|ˈ|d|ɜr|m|ə|t|ə}} (from [[Ancient Greek]] ἐχῖνος ''echīnos'' &quot;hedgehog&quot; and δέρμα ''derma'' &quot;skin&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;OnlineEtDict&quot;&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=echinoderm|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=echinoderm&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[animal]]s. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) [[radial symmetry]], and include [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[sand dollar]]s, and [[sea cucumber]]s, as well as the [[Crinoid|sea lilies]] or &quot;stone lilies&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/6015/Sea-Lily.html|title=Sea Lily|publisher=Science Encyclopedia|accessdate=2014-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the [[intertidal zone]] to the [[abyssal zone]].
The phylum contains about 7000 living [[species]],&lt;ref name=&quot;adw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Echinodermata.html|title=Animal Diversity Web - Echinodermata|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the second-largest grouping of [[deuterostome]]s (a superphylum), after the [[chordata|chordates]] (which include the [[vertebrate]]s, such as [[bird]]s, [[fish]]es, [[mammal]]s, and [[reptile]]s). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives.

Aside from the hard-to-classify ''[[Arkarua]]'' (a [[Precambrian]] animal with echinoderm-like pentamerous radial symmetry), the first definitive members of the phylum appeared near the start of the [[Cambrian]]. One group of Cambrian echinoderms, the cinctans ([[Homalozoa]]), which are close to the base of the echinoderm origin, have been found to possess external gills used for filter feeding, similar to those possessed by chordates and [[hemichordata|hemichordates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2015-10-simulations-reveal-early-animal.html#nRlv|title=Computer simulations reveal feeding in early animal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The echinoderms are important both ecologically and geologically. Ecologically, there are few other groupings so abundant in the [[Continental shelf|biotic desert]] of the [[deep sea]], as well as shallower oceans. Most echinoderms are able to [[asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]] and [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] tissue, organs, and limbs; in some cases, they can undergo complete regeneration from a single limb. Geologically, the value of echinoderms is in their [[ossification|ossified]] [[skeleton]]s, which are major contributors to many [[limestone]] formations, and can provide valuable clues as to the geological environment. They were the most used species in regenerative research in the 19th and 20th centuries. Further, some scientists hold that the radiation of echinoderms was responsible for the [[Mesozoic Marine Revolution]].

[[File:EarlyEchinoderms NT.jpg|thumb|right|Early echinoderms]]
Along with the [[Chordata|chordates]] and [[Hemichordata|hemichordates]], echinoderms are [[deuterostome]]s, one of the two major divisions of the [[bilaterians, the other being the [[protostome]]s. During the early development of the embryo, in deuterostomes, the [[blastopore]] (the first opening to form) becomes the [[anus]] whereas in the protostomes, it becomes the mouth. In deuterostomes, the mouth develops at a later stage, at the opposite end of the [[blastula]] from the blastopore, and a gut forms connecting the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorit779&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Dorit| first1 = R.

There are a total of about 7,000 [[extant taxon|extant]] species of echinoderm as well as about 13,000 extinct species.&lt;ref name=Tree /&gt; They are found in habitats ranging from shallow intertidal areas to abyssal depths. Two main subdivisions are traditionally recognised: the more familiar [[Motility|motile]] [[Eleutherozoa]], which encompasses the Asteroidea ([[starfish]], 1,745 recent species), Ophiuroidea ([[brittle stars]], 2,300 species), Echinoidea ([[sea urchin]]s and [[sand dollar]]s, 900 species) and Holothuroidea ([[sea cucumber]]s, 1,430 species); and the [[Pelmatozoa]], some of which are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] while others move around. These consist of the Crinoidea ([[feather star]]s and [[Sea lily|sea lilies]], 580 species) and the extinct [[Blastozoa|blastoids]] and [[Paracrinoid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uthicke&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Uthicke, Sven |author2=Schaffelke, Britta |author3=Byrne, Maria |date=1 January 2009 |title=A boom–bust phylum?

It is a disc-like fossil with radial ridges on the rim and a five-pointed central depression marked with radial lines. However, no [[stereom]] or internal structure showing a water vascular system is present and the identification is inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vendian/arkarua.html |title=Vendian Animals: ''Arkarua'' |author=Smith, Dave |date=28 September 2005 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first universally accepted echinoderms appear in the [[Lower Cambrian]] period, asterozoans appeared in the [[Ordovician]] and the crinoids were a dominant group in the [[Paleozoic]].&lt;ref name=Waggoner/&gt; Echinoderms left behind an extensive fossil record.&lt;ref name=Waggoner/&gt; It is hypothesised that the ancestor of all echinoderms was a simple, motile, bilaterally symmetrical animal with a mouth, gut and anus. This ancestral stock adopted an attached mode of life and suspension feeding, and developed radial symmetry as this was more advantageous for such an existence. The larvae of all echinoderms are even now bilaterally symmetrical and all develop radial symmetry at metamorphosis. The starfish and crinoids still attach themselves to the seabed while changing to their adult form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorit793&quot;&gt;Dorit, Walker &amp; Barnes (1991) pp. 792–793&lt;/ref&gt;

The first echinoderms later gave rise to free-moving groups. The evolution of endoskeletal plates with stereom structure and of external ciliary grooves for feeding were early echinoderm developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UCMP Berkeley|first=edu|title=Echinodermata: Morphology|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/echinodermata/echinomm.html|work=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paleozoic echinoderms were globular, attached to the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] and were orientated with their oral surfaces upwards. The fossil echinoderms had [[ambulacral groove]]s extending down the side of the body, fringed on either side by brachioles, structures very similar to the pinnules of a modern crinoid. It seems probable that the mouth-upward orientation is the primitive state and that at some stage, all the classes of echinoderms except the crinoids reversed this to become mouth-downward. Before this happened, the podia probably had a feeding function as they do in the crinoids today. Their locomotor function came later, after the re-orientation of the mouth when the podia were in contact with the substrate for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorit793&quot; /&gt;

==Anatomy and physiology==
Echinoderms evolved from animals with [[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]]. Although adult echinoderms possess [[symmetry (biology)#Animals|pentaradial]], or five-sided, symmetry, echinoderm larvae are [[cilia]]ted, free-swimming organisms that organize in bilateral symmetry which makes them look like embryonic [[chordate]]s. Later, the left side of the body grows at the expense of the right side, which is eventually absorbed. The left side then grows in a [[Pentaradial symmetry#Pentamerism|pentaradially]] symmetric fashion, in which the body is arranged in five parts around a central axis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert873&quot;&gt;Ruppert, Fox &amp; Barnes (2004) p. 873&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[Asterozoa]], there can be a few exceptions from the rule. The starfish genus ''[[Leptasterias]]'' normally have six arms, although five-armed individuals can occur. Also the [[Brisingida]] have six armed species. Amongst the brittle stars, six-armed species such as ''Ophiothela danae'', ''[[Ophiactis savignyi]]'', and ''Ophionotus hexactis'' exists, and ''Ophiacantha vivipara'' often has more than six.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.no/books?id=EtkqDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq=Seven+Ophiacantha+species+are+recorded+from+the&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK5Laq98zYAhUjhqYKHVBzBL4Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Seven%20Ophiacantha%20species%20are%20recorded%20from%20the&amp;f=false Australian Echinoderms: Biology, Ecology and Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Echinoderms exhibit secondary radial symmetry in portions of their body at some stage of life. This, however, is an adaptation to their sessile existence. They developed from other members of the Bilateria and exhibit bilateral symmetry in their larval stage. Many crinoids and some seastars exhibit symmetry in multiples of the basic five, with starfish such as ''[[Labidiaster annulatus]]'' known to possess up to fifty arms, and the [[sea-lily]] ''[[Comaster schlegelii]]'' having two hundred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messing&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nova.edu/ocean/messing/crinoids/4%20Morphology%20crown%20&amp;%20calyx.html |title=Crown and calyx |author=Messing, Charles |work=Charles Messing's Crinoid Pages |accessdate=2012-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193832/http://www.nova.edu/ocean/messing/crinoids/4%20Morphology%20crown%20%26%20calyx.html |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skin and skeleton===

[[File:Crinoid on the reef of Batu Moncho Island.JPG|thumb|right|[[Crinoid]] on a [[coral reef]]]]
Echinoderms have a [[mesoderm]]al skeleton composed of calcareous plates or [[Ossicle (echinoderm)|ossicles]]. Each one of these, even the articulating spine of a sea urchin, is composed mineralogically of a [[crystal]] of [[calcite]]. If solid, these would form a heavy skeleton, so they have a sponge-like porous structure known as stereom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Behrens| first1 = Peter| last2 = Bäuerlein| first2 = Edmund| title = Handbook of Biomineralization: Biomimetic and bioinspired chemistry'| year = 2007| publisher = Wiley-VCH| isbn = 978-3-527-31805-6| page = 393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ossicles may be fused together, as in the [[Test (biology)|test]] of sea urchins, or may articulate with each other as in the arms of sea stars, brittle stars and crinoids. The ossicles may be flat plates or bear external projections in the form of spines, granules or warts and they are supported by a tough [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] (skin). Skeletal elements are also deployed in some specialized ways, such as the &quot;[[Aristotle's lantern]]&quot; mouthparts of sea urchins used for grinding, the supportive stalks of crinoids and the structural &quot;lime ring&quot; of sea cucumbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert873&quot; /&gt;

Despite the robustness of the individual skeletal modules complete skeletons of starfish, brittle stars and crinoids are rare in the fossil record. This is because they quickly disarticulate (disconnect from each other) once the encompassing skin rots away, and in the absence of tissue there is nothing to hold the plates together. The modular construction is a result of the growth system employed by echinoderms, which adds new segments at the centre of the radial limbs, pushing the existing plates outwards and lengthening the arms. Sea urchins on the other hand are often well preserved in chalk beds or limestone. During fossilization, the cavities in the stereom are filled in with calcite that is in crystalline continuity with the surrounding material. On fracturing such rock, distinctive cleavage patterns can be seen and sometimes even the intricate internal and external structure of the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Palaeontology |last=Davies |first=A. Morley |year=1925 |publisher=Thomas Murby  |pages=240–241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The epidermis consists of cells responsible for the support and maintenance of the skeleton, as well as pigment cells, [[mechanoreception|mechanoreceptor]] cells (which detect motion on the animal's surface), and sometimes gland cells which secrete sticky fluids or even [[toxin]]s. The varied and often vivid colours of echinoderms are produced by the action of skin pigment cells. These are produced by a variable combination of coloured pigments, such as the dark [[melanin]], red [[carotinoid]]s, and [[carotene]] proteins, which can be blue, green, or violet. These may be light-sensitive, and as a result many echinoderms change appearance completely as night falls. The reaction can happen quickly – the sea urchin ''[[Centrostephanus longispinus]]'' changes from jet black to grey-brown in just fifty minutes when exposed to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weber, W. |author2=Dambach, M. |date=April 1974 |title=Light-sensitivity of isolated pigment cells of the sea urchin ''Centrostephanus longispinus'' |journal=Cell and Tissue Research |volume=148 |issue=3 |pages=437–440 |doi=10.1007/BF00224270 |pmid=4831958 |s2cid=1669387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of most echinoderms is a special kind of tissue known as [[catch connective tissue]]. This collagenous material can change its mechanical properties in a few seconds or minutes through nervous control rather than by muscular means. This tissue enables a starfish to change from moving flexibly around the seabed to becoming rigid while prying open a [[Bivalvia|bivalve mollusc]] or preventing itself from being extracted from a crevice. Similarly, sea urchins can lock their normally mobile spines rigidly as a defensive mechanism when attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Motokawa, Tatsuo |date=May 1984 |title=Connective tissue catch in echinoderms |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=255–270 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.1984.tb00409.x |s2cid=86391676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The water vascular system===
{{Main|Water vascular system}}
Echinoderms possess a unique water vascular system. This is a network of fluid-filled canals derived from the [[coelom]] (body cavity) that function in gas exchange, feeding, sensory reception and locomotion. This system varies between different classes of echinoderm but typically opens to the exterior through a sieve-like [[madreporite]] on the aboral (upper) surface of the animal. The madreporite is linked to a slender duct, the stone canal, which extends to a ring canal that encircles the mouth or oesophagus. From this, radial canals extend along the arms of asteroids and adjoin the test in the ambulacral areas of echinoids. Short lateral canals branch off the radial canals, each one ending in an ampulla. Part of the ampulla can protrude through a pore (or a pair of pores in sea urchins) to the exterior and is known as a podium or [[tube feet]]. The water vascular system assists with the distribution of nutrients throughout the animal's body and is most obviously expressed in the tube feet which can be extended or contracted by the redistribution of fluid between the foot and the internal sac.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorit791&quot;&gt;Dorit, Walker &amp; Barnes (1991) pp. 780–791&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization of the system is somewhat different in ophiuroids where the madreporite may be on the oral surface and the podia lack suckers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorit785&quot;&gt;Dorit, Walker &amp; Barnes (1991) pp. 784–785&lt;/ref&gt; In holothuroids, the podia may be reduced or absent and the madreporite opens into the body cavity so that the circulating liquid is [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] rather than sea water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorit789&quot;&gt;Dorit, Walker &amp; Barnes (1991) pp. 788–789&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangements in crinoids is similar to asteroids but the tube feet lack suckers and are used to pass food particles captured by the arms towards the central mouth. In the asteroids, the same wafting motion is employed to move the animal across the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorit783&quot;&gt;Dorit, Walker &amp; Barnes (1991) pp. 780–783&lt;/ref&gt; Sea urchins use their feet to prevent the larvae of encrusting organisms from settling on their surfaces; potential settlers are moved to the urchin's mouth and eaten. Some burrowing sea stars extend their elongated dorsal tube feet to the surface of the sand or mud above and use them to absorb oxygen from the [[water column]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert905&quot;&gt;Ruppert, Fox &amp; Barnes (2004) p. 905&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other organs===
Echinoderms possess a simple digestive system which varies according to the animal's diet. Starfish are mostly carnivorous and have a mouth, oesophagus, two-part stomach, intestine and rectum, with the anus located in the centre of the aboral body surface. With a few exceptions, the members of the order [[Paxillosida]] do not possess an anus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.no/books?id=uXxSdaYWPG4C&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Paxillosida+%22The+digestive+system+of+paxillosids+is+rather%22&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJsa-b6IPZAhUSPFAKHRFYArEQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Paxillosida%20%22The%20digestive%20system%20of%20paxillosids%20is%20rather%22&amp;f=false Echinoderm Nutrition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7U4-zUmd2EC&amp;q=%2522Sampling+biodiversity+in+coastal+communities%2522+rigby+shirayama |title=Sampling Biodiversity in Coastal Communities: NaGISA Protocols for Seagrass and Macroalgal Habitats |last1=Rigby |first1=P.

In other species, whole food items such as [[mollusc]]s may be ingested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert885&quot;&gt;Ruppert, Fox &amp; Barnes (2004) p. 885&lt;/ref&gt; Brittle stars have a blind gut with no intestine or anus. They have varying diets and expel [[food waste]] through their mouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert891&quot;&gt;Ruppert, Fox &amp; Barnes (2004) p. 891&lt;/ref&gt; Sea urchins are herbivores and use their specialised mouthparts to graze, tear and chew [[algae]] and sometimes other animal or vegetable material. They have an oesophagus, a large stomach and a rectum with the anus at the apex of the test.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert904&quot;&gt;Ruppert, Fox &amp; Barnes (2004) pp. 902–904&lt;/ref&gt; Sea cucumbers are mostly [[detritivore]]s, sorting through the sediment with their buccal tentacles which are modified tube feet. Sand and mud accompanies their food through their simple gut which has a long coiled intestine and a capacious [[cloaca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert912&quot;&gt;Ruppert, Fox &amp; Barnes (2004) p. 912&lt;/ref&gt; Crinoids are passive [[suspension feeder]]s, catching [[plankton]] with their outstretched arms. Boluses of mucus-trapped food are passed to the mouth which is linked to the anus by a loop consisting of a short oesophagus and longer intestine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert920&quot;&gt;Ruppert, Fox &amp; Barnes (2004) p. 920&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[body cavity|coelomic cavities]] of echinoderms are complex. Aside from the water vascular system, echinoderms have a [[circulatory system|haemal coelom]] (or haemal system, the &quot;haemal&quot; being a misnomer), a perivisceral coelom, a gonadal coelom and often also a perihaemal coelom (or perihaemal system).&lt;ref&gt;J. Moore. ''An Introduction to the Invertebrates'', Cambridge Univ. Press, 2nd ed., 2006, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; During development, echinoderm coelom is divided in metacoel, mesocoel and protocoel (also called somatocoel, hydrocoel and axocoel, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;C. Hickman Jr., L. Roberts, A. Larson. ''Animal Diversity''. Granite Hill Publishers, 2003. p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; The water vascular system, haemal system and perihaemal system form the tubular coelomic system.&lt;ref name=&quot;wbd.etibioinformatics.nl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ns-echinodermata.linnaeus.naturalis.nl/linnaeus_ng/app/views/introduction/topic.php?id=3414&amp;epi=185|title=Macrobenthos of the North Sea - Echinodermata &gt; Introduction|work=etibioinformatics.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echinoderms are an exception having both a coelomic circulatory system (i.e., the water vascular system) and a haemal circulatory system (i.e., the haemal and perihaemal systems).&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Claus. ''Animal Evolution: Interrelationships of the Living Phyla''. 3rd ed. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Haemal and perihaemal systems are derived from the coelom and form an [[open circulatory system|open]] and reduced circulatory system. This usually consists of a central ring and five radial vessels. There is no true [[heart]] and the blood often lacks any respiratory pigment. Gaseous exchange occurs via dermal branchiae or papulae in starfish, genital bursae in brittle stars, peristominal gills in sea urchins and cloacal trees in sea cucumbers. Exchange of gases also takes place through the tube feet. Echinoderms lack specialized excretory (waste disposal) organs and so [[nitrogenous waste]], chiefly in the form of [[ammonia]], diffuses out through the respiratory surfaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorit791&quot; /&gt;

The coelomic fluid contains the [[coelomocyte]]s, or immune cells. There are several types of immune cells, which vary among classes and species. All classes possess a type of [[Phagocytosis|phagocytic]] amebocyte, which engulf invading particles and infected cells, aggregate or clot, and may be involved in [[cytotoxicity]]. These cells are usually larger and granular, and are suggested to be a main line of defense against potential pathogens.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramirez-Gomez|first=Fransisco|date=27 September 2010|title=Echinoderm Immunity|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46817611|journal=Invertebrate Survival Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the class, echinoderms may have spherule cells (for cytotoxicity, inflammation, and anti-bacterial activity), vibratile cells (for coelomic fluid movement and clotting), and crystal cells (potential osmoregulatory cells in sea cucumbers),.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Courtney|date=January 2010|title=Echinoderm Immunity|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51085209|journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|volume=708|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-8059-5_14|pmid=21528703|pages=260–301|isbn=978-1-4419-8058-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coelomocytes also secrete [[Antimicrobial peptides|Anti-Microbial Peptides]] (AMPs) against bacteria, and have a set of [[lectin]]s and [[Complement system|complement proteins]] as part of an innate immune system that is still being characterized.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnlineEtDict&quot; /&gt;

Echinoderms have a simple radial [[nervous system]] that consists of a modified [[nerve net]] consisting of interconnecting neurons with no central [[brain]], although some do possess [[ganglion|ganglia]]. Nerves radiate from central rings around the mouth into each arm or along the body wall; the branches of these nerves coordinate the movements of the organism and the synchronisation of the tube feet. Starfish have sensory cells in the epithelium and have simple [[Ocelli|eyespots]] and touch-sensitive tentacle-like tube feet at the tips of their arms. Sea urchins have no particular sense organs but do have [[statocyst]]s that assist in gravitational orientation, and they have sensory cells in their epidermis, particularly in the tube feet, spines and [[pedicellariae]]. Brittle stars, crinoids and sea cucumbers in general do not have sensory organs but some burrowing sea cucumbers of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Apodida]] have a single statocyst adjoining each radial nerve and some have an eyespot at the base of each tentacle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert929&quot;&gt;Ruppert, Fox &amp; Barnes (2004) pp. 872–929&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gonad]]s occupy much of the body cavities of sea urchins and sea cucumbers, while the less voluminous crinoids, brittle stars and starfish have two gonads in each arm. While the ancestral condition is considered to be the possession of one genital aperture, many organisms have multiple [[gonopore]]s through which eggs or sperm may be released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert929&quot; /&gt;

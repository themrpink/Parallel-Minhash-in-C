In Greece, where there is a smaller version in addition to the regular one, that variety is called Parizaki or Mortadelaki, and in Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and North Macedonia, the product known as ''mortadela'' is widely eaten. 

In Poland, ''mortadela'' slices are sometimes dipped in batter, fried and served with potatoes and salads as a quicker (and cheaper) alternative to traditional [[pork chop]]s{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}.

===Middle East and North Africa===
In several countries, such as Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel, [[halal]] or [[kosher]] mortadella is sold, which is made from chicken, beef, or turkey. The Siniora brand, established in Jerusalem in 1920, is the first in the region, a mortadella with sliced olives, pistachios or pepper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Farmer Jack — a Siniora Sons Inc. Company|url = http://farmerjack.ps/en/|website = farmerjack.ps|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese Al-Taghziah is a famous brand that is sold around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Taghziah|url=http://altaghziah.com/newweb/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular brands in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] are [[Americana Group]] and Halwani Brothers.
It is also popular in Iran, albeit usually made with beef or lamb, and called commonly ''kaalbas'', from Russian ''kolbasa''.

Pork mortadella is sold in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and the UAE.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===United States===
A similar commercial sausage product that omits the cubes of pork fat, called [[Bologna sausage|bologna]], is popular in the United States. A variety that includes olives and pimentos is called [[olive loaf]].

Mortadella is one of the three meats in [[Central Grocery|Central Grocery's]] [[Muffaletta]] Sandwich in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States|USA]] along with Holland ham and Genoa salami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchquarter.com/best-muffulettas-french-quarter-nearby/|title=Best Muffulettas in the French Quarter and Nearby|website=FrenchQuarter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortadella was banned from import into the United States from 1967 to 2000 due to an outbreak of African swine fever in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/13/weekinreview/february-6-12-the-return-of-mortadella.html|title=The Return of Mortadella|date=13 February 2000|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ban was a pivotal part of the plot of the 1971 film [[Lady Liberty (film)|''La mortadella'']] starring [[Sophia Loren]]. The title for the United States release was ''[[Lady Liberty (film)|Lady Liberty]]''.

The ban in the United States was lifted due to the [[Veterinary equivalency|Veterinary Equivalency Agreement]] that allowed countries to export products that had been shown to be disease-free as part of an overall agreement that would allow products deemed safe in the United States to be exported to the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/10/world/bologna-journal-coming-to-a-deli-near-you-a-long-taboo-sausage.html|title=Bologna Journal; Coming to a Deli Near You: A Long-Taboo Sausage|date=10 February 2000|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia and former Soviet Union===
In Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet states, a very similar product is called ''[[Doctor's sausage|doktorskaya kolbasa]]'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Докторская колбаса}}, lit. &quot;doctor's sausage&quot;). However, this product is normally made from mixture of beef and pork (sometimes beef and lamb or chicken for [[Halal|religious]] [[Kosher|reasons]]), and does not include pieces of fat or myrtle; mortadella-style sausages with pieces of fat are called ''lubitelskaya'' and ''stolichnaya''. Instead, it is flavoured with just [[coriander]] and [[nutmeg]] and also traditionally contains eggs and milk, which are usually absent in traditional mortadella. Unlike mortadella, ''doktorskaya kolbasa''  contains lower amounts of fat and is high in proteins.

The name &quot;doctor's sausage&quot; was coined in the Soviet Union in the 1930s to refer to sausages and meat products recommended by doctors to help with undernourishment and stomach problems. During the Soviet era, it was commonly advertised as being nutritious (due to its low fat content) and remained popular throughout former Soviet states to the present day. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/russian-kitchen/329437-doctors-sausage-soviet-russian-kitchen|title=Russian Kitchen - Why the Soviets' favorite bologna was called &quot;doctor's sausage&quot;?|work=Russia Beyond the Headlines}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===East Asia===
''[[Chả lụa]]'' or Vietnamese mortadella is sometimes used as an accompaniment to the Vietnamese dish ''[[bánh cuốn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noodlepie.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/stall_1006_banh.html|title=Stall 1006 - Banh Cuon - noodlepie|work=typepad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manuel I Komnenos''' ({{lang-el|Μανουήλ Α' Κομνηνός}}; 28 November 1118 – 24 September 1180), [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] '''Comnenus''', also called '''Porphyrogennetos''' (&quot;[[born in the purple]]&quot;), was a [[Byzantine emperor]] of the 12th century who reigned over a crucial turning point in the history of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] and the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]]. His reign saw the last flowering of the [[Komnenian restoration]], during which the Byzantine Empire had seen a resurgence of its military and economic power, and had enjoyed a cultural revival.

Eager to restore his empire to its past glories as the superpower of the Mediterranean world, Manuel pursued an energetic and ambitious foreign policy. In the process he made alliances with [[Pope Adrian IV]] and the resurgent [[Latin West|West]]. He invaded the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Kingdom of Sicily]], although unsuccessfully, being the last Eastern Roman Emperor to attempt reconquests in the western [[Mediterranean]]. The passage of the potentially dangerous [[Second Crusade]] through his empire was adroitly managed. Manuel [[#Manuel in Antioch|established a Byzantine protectorate]] over the [[Crusader states]] of [[Outremer]]. Facing [[Muslim]] advances in the [[Holy Land]], he made common cause with the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|participated in a combined invasion]] of [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]]. Manuel reshaped the political maps of the [[Balkans]] and the eastern Mediterranean, placing the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and Outremer under Byzantine [[hegemony]] and campaigning aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east.

However, towards the end of his reign Manuel's achievements in the east were compromised by a serious defeat at [[Battle of Myriokephalon|Myriokephalon]], which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well-defended [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] position. Although the [[Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir|Byzantines recovered]] and Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with Sultan [[Kilij Arslan II]], Myriokephalon proved to be [[Battle of Myriokephalon#Aftermath|the final, unsuccessful effort]] by the empire to recover the interior of [[Anatolia]] from the [[Seljuq dynasty|Turks]].

Called ''ho Megas'' ({{lang|grc|ὁ Μέγας}}, translated as &quot;[[the Great]]&quot;) by the [[Greeks]], Manuel is known to have inspired intense loyalty in those who served him. He also appears as the hero of a history written by his secretary, [[John Kinnamos]], in which every virtue is attributed to him. Manuel, who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders, enjoyed the reputation of &quot;the most blessed emperor of [[Constantinople]]&quot; in parts of the [[Western Christianity|Latin world]] as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;M3&quot;&gt;P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians, however, have been less enthusiastic about him. Some of them assert that the great power he wielded was not his own personal achievement, but that of the [[Komnenos|dynasty]] he represented; they also argue that, since Byzantine imperial power declined catastrophically after Manuel's death, it is only natural to look for the causes of this decline in his reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;M3-4&quot;&gt;P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accession to the throne==
[[Image:BN MS FR 2628 Folio134 Comnenus.png|thumb|left|200px|Death of John II Komnenos, and crowning of Manuel I Komnenos (from the Manuscript of [[William of Tyre]]'s ''Historia'' and ''Old French Continuation'', painted in [[Acre, Israel]], 13th century, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]).]]

Born on 28 November 1118, Manuel Komnenos was the fourth son of [[John II Komnenos]] and [[Irene of Hungary]], so it seemed very unlikely that he would succeed his father.&lt;ref name = &quot;Stone&quot;/&gt; His maternal grandfather was [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|St. Ladislaus]]. Manuel favourably impressed his father by his courage and fortitude during the unsuccessful Siege of [[Neocaesarea]] (1140), against the [[Danishmendid]] Turks. In 1143 John II lay dying as a result of an infected wound; on his deathbed he chose Manuel as his successor, in preference to his elder surviving brother [[Isaac Komnenos (son of John II)|Isaac]]. John cited Manuel's courage and readiness to take advice, in contrast to Isaac's irascibility and unbending pride, as the reasons for his choice. After John died on 8 April 1143, his son, Manuel, was acclaimed emperor by the armies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gib72&quot;&gt;Gibbon, ''The decline and fall of the Roman Empire'', 72&lt;/ref&gt; Yet his succession was by no means assured: with his father's army in the wilds of [[Cilicia]] far from Constantinople, he recognised that it was vital he should return to the capital as soon as possible. He still had to take care of his father's funeral, and tradition demanded he organise the foundation of a monastery on the spot where his father died. Swiftly, he dispatched the ''[[megas domestikos]]'' [[John Axouch]] ahead of him, with orders to arrest his most dangerous potential rival, his brother Isaac, who was living in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]] with instant access to the imperial treasure and regalia. Axouch arrived in the capital even before news of the emperor's death had reached it. He quickly secured the loyalty of the city, and when Manuel entered the capital in August 1143, he was crowned by the new [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarch]], [[Michael II Kourkouas]]. A few days later, with nothing more to fear as his position as emperor was now secure, Manuel ordered the release of Isaac.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGS&quot;&gt;Gibbon, ''The decline and fall of the Roman Empire'', 72&lt;br /&gt;* J. H. Norwich, ''A short history of Byzantium''&lt;br /&gt;* A. Stone, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/mannycom.htm Manuel I Comnenus]&lt;/ref&gt; Then he ordered 2 golden pieces to be given to every householder in Constantinople and 200 pounds of gold (including 200 silver pieces annually) to be given to the Byzantine Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;gold&quot;&gt;J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire that Manuel inherited from his father had undergone great changes since the foundation of Constantinople by [[Constantine I]] eight centuries before. In the time of [[Justinian I]] (527–565), parts of the former Western Roman Empire had been recovered including Italy, Africa and part of Spain. However, the empire had diminished greatly following this. The most obvious change had occurred in the 7th century: the soldiers of [[Islam]] had taken [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)#Middle Ages|Palestine]] and much of [[Syria]] away from the empire irrevocably. They had then swept on westwards into what in the time of Constantine had been the western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]], in North Africa and Spain. In the centuries since, the emperors had ruled over a realm that largely consisted of [[Asia Minor]] in the east, and the Balkans in the west.  In the late 11th century the Byzantine Empire entered a period of marked military and political decline, which had been arrested and largely reversed by the leadership of Manuel's grandfather and father. Yet the empire that Manuel inherited was a polity facing formidable challenges. At the end of the 11th century, the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]] had removed Italy from the control of the Byzantine Emperor. The Seljuk Turks had done the same with central [[Anatolia]]. And in the [[Levant]], a new force had appeared – the [[Crusader states]] – which presented the Byzantine Empire with new challenges. Now, more than at any time during the preceding centuries, the task facing the emperor was daunting indeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLBr&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantium|encyclopedia=Papyros-Larousse-Britannica|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Crusade and Raynald of Châtillon==
{{details|Second Crusade}}

===Prince of Antioch===
[[Image:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|The County of Edessa in the context of the other states of the [[Near East]] in 1135]]
The first test of Manuel's reign came in 1144, when he was faced with a demand by [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]], [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]] for the cession of Cilician territories. However, later that year the crusader [[County of Edessa]] was engulfed by the tide of a resurgent Islamic [[jihad]] under [[Imad ad-Din Atabeg Zengi|Imad ad-Din Zengi]]. Raymond realized that immediate help from the west was out of the question.  With his eastern flank now dangerously exposed to this new threat, there seemed little option but for him to prepare for a humiliating visit to Constantinople. Swallowing his pride, he made the journey north to ask for the protection of the Emperor. After submitting to Manuel, he was promised the support that he had requested, and his allegiance to Byzantium was secured.&lt;ref name=&quot;M173&quot;&gt;J. Cinnamus, ''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus'', 33–35&lt;br /&gt;* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expedition against Konya===
In 1146 Manuel assembled his army at the military base [[Lopadion]] and set out on a [[punitive expedition]] against [[Mesud I|Masud]] the Sultan of [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm|Rûm]], who had been repeatedly violating the frontiers of the Empire in western [[Anatolia]] and [[Cilicia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tread640&quot;&gt;W. Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 640&lt;/ref&gt; There was no attempt at a systematic conquest of territory, but Manuel's army defeated the Turks at [[Afyonkarahisar|Acroënus]], before capturing and destroying the fortified town of [[Philomelion]], removing its remaining Christian population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tread640&quot; /&gt; The Byzantine forces reached Masud's capital, [[Konya]], and ravaged the area around the city, but could not assault its walls. Among Manuel's motives for mounting this razzia there included a wish to be seen in the West as actively espousing the crusading ideal; Kinnamos also attributed to Manuel a desire to show off his martial prowess to his new bride.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cinnamus, ''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus'', 47&lt;br /&gt;* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 42&lt;/ref&gt; While on this campaign Manuel received a letter from [[Louis VII of France]] announcing his intention of leading an army to the relief of the crusader states.&lt;ref&gt;Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of the Crusaders===
[[Image:Arrivée des croisés à Constantinople.jpg|thumb|left|Arrival of the Second Crusade before Constantinople, portrayed in Jean Fouquet's painting from around 1455–1460, ''Arrivée des croisés à Constantinople''.]]

Manuel was prevented from capitalizing on his conquests by events in the Balkans that urgently required his presence. In 1147 he granted a passage through his dominions to two armies of the Second Crusade under [[Conrad III of Germany]] and [[Louis VII of France]]. At this time, there were still members of the Byzantine court who remembered the passage of the [[First Crusade]], a defining event in the collective memory of the age that had fascinated Manuel's aunt, [[Anna Komnene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AC333&quot;&gt;A. Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', 333&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Byzantines feared the Crusade, a view endorsed by the numerous acts of vandalism and theft practiced by the unruly armies as they marched through Byzantine territory. Byzantine troops followed the Crusaders, attempting to police their behaviour, and further troops were assembled in Constantinople, ready to defend the capital against any acts of aggression. This cautious approach was well advised, but still the numerous incidents of covert and open hostility between the Franks and the Greeks on their line of march, for which it seems both sides were to blame,  precipitated conflict between Manuel and his guests. Manuel took the precaution – which his grandfather had not taken – of making repairs to the [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]], and he pressed the two kings for guarantees concerning the security of his territories. Conrad's army was the first to enter the Byzantine territory in the summer of 1147, and it figures more prominently in the Byzantine sources, which imply that it was the more troublesome of the two.{{Cref|a}} Indeed, the contemporary Byzantine historian [[John Kinnamos|Kinnamos]] describes a full-scale [[Battle of Constantinople (1147)|clash]] between a Byzantine force and part of Conrad's army, outside the walls of Constantinople. The Byzantines defeated the Germans and, in Byzantine eyes, this reverse caused Conrad to agree to have his army speedily ferried across to [[Üsküdar|Damalis]] on the Asian shore of the Bosphoros.&lt;ref&gt;Kinnamos, pp. 65–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birkenmeier, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1147, however, the relations between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law [[Bertha of Sulzbach]] he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against [[Roger II of Sicily]].&lt;ref name=&quot;M621&quot;&gt;P. Magdalino, ''The Byzantine Empire'', 621&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, [[Frederick Barbarossa]].{{Cref|b}}

===Cyprus invaded===
[[Image:Image-Manuel-Pope.jpg|thumb|right|Letter by Manuel I Komnenos to [[Pope Eugene III]] on the issue of the crusades ([[Constantinople]], 1146, [[Vatican Secret Archives]]): with this document, the Emperor answers a previous papal letter asking [[Louis VII of France]] to free the [[Holy Land]] and reconquer [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. Manuel answers that he is willing to receive the French army and to support it, but he complains about receiving the letter from an envoy of the [[King of France]] and not from an ambassador sent by the Pope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vat&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Manuel's attention was again drawn to Antioch in 1156, when [[Raynald of Châtillon]], the new Prince of Antioch, claimed that the Byzantine emperor had reneged on his promise to pay him a sum of money and vowed to attack the Byzantine province of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;R238&quot;&gt;P. P. Read, ''The Templars'', 238&lt;/ref&gt; Raynald arrested the governor of the island, John Komnenos, who was a nephew of Manuel, and the general Michael Branas.&lt;ref name=&quot;R239&quot;&gt;P. P. Read, ''The Templars'', 239&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin historian [[William of Tyre]] deplored this act of war against fellow Christians and described the atrocities committed by Raynald's men in considerable detail.&lt;ref&gt;William of Tyre, ''Historia'', XVIII, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/18.html#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt; Having ransacked the island and plundered all its wealth, Raynald's army mutilated the survivors before forcing them to buy back their flocks at exorbitant prices with what little they had left. Thus enriched with enough booty to make Antioch wealthy for years, the invaders boarded their ships and set sail for home.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carole Hillenbrand|C. Hillenbrand]], ''The Imprisonment of Raynald of Châtillon'', 80&lt;br /&gt;* T. F. Madden, ''The New Concise History of the Crusades'', 65&lt;/ref&gt; Raynald also sent some of the mutilated hostages to Constantinople as a vivid demonstration of his disobedience and his contempt for the Byzantine emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;R239&quot; /&gt;

Manuel responded to this outrage in a characteristically energetic way. In the winter of 1158–59, he marched to Cilicia at the head of a huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Thoros II of Armenia|Thoros of Cilicia]], who had participated in the attack on Cyprus.&lt;ref name=&quot;M67&quot;&gt;P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 67&lt;/ref&gt; Thoros fled into the mountains, and Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, Elizabeth; Jeffreys, Michael (2015) &quot;A Constantinopolitan Poet Views Frankish Antioch&quot;.

===Manuel in Antioch===
Meanwhile, news of the advance of the [[Komnenian army|Byzantine army]] soon reached Antioch. Raynald knew that he had no hope of defeating the emperor, and in addition knew that he could not expect any aid from king [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]]. Baldwin did not approve of Raynald's attack on Cyprus, and in any case had already made an agreement with Manuel. Thus isolated and abandoned by his allies, Raynald decided that abject submission was his only hope. He appeared before the Emperor, dressed in a sack with a rope tied around his neck, and begged for forgiveness. Manuel at first ignored the prostrate Raynald, chatting with his courtiers; William of Tyre commented that this ignominious scene continued for so long that all present were &quot;disgusted&quot; by it.&lt;ref&gt;B. Hamilton, ''William of Tyre and the Byzantine Empire'', 226&lt;br /&gt;* William of Tyre, ''Historia'', XVIII, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/18.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Manuel forgave Raynald on condition that he would become a vassal of the Empire, effectively surrendering the independence of Antioch to Byzantium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Principality of Antioch under byzantine protection.png|thumb|left|Antioch under Byzantine protection (1159–1180)]]

Peace having been restored, a grand ceremonial procession was staged on 12 April 1159 for the triumphant entry of the Byzantine army into the city, with Manuel riding through the streets on horseback, while the Prince of Antioch and the [[King of Jerusalem]] followed on foot. Manuel dispensed justice to the citizens and presided over games and tournaments for the crowd. In May, at the head of a united Christian army, he started on the road to Edessa, but he abandoned the campaign when he secured the release by [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], the ruler of [[Syria]], of 6,000 Christian prisoners captured in various battles since the second Crusade.&lt;ref name=Norwich&gt;Z. N. Brooke, ''A History of Europe, from 911 to 1198'', 482&lt;br /&gt;* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 67&lt;br /&gt;* J. H. Norwich, ''A short history of Byzantium''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the glorious end of the expedition, modern scholars argue that Manuel ultimately achieved much less than he had desired in terms of imperial restoration.{{Cref|c}}

Satisfied with his efforts thus far, Manuel headed back to Constantinople. On their way back, his troops were surprised in line of march by the Turks. Despite this, they won a complete victory, routing the enemy army from the field and inflicting heavy losses. In the following year, Manuel drove the Turks out of [[Isauria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;P121&quot;&gt;K. Paparrigopoulos, ''History of the Greek Nation'', Db, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1147 Manuel was faced with war by [[Roger II of Sicily]], whose fleet had captured the Byzantine island of [[Corfu]] and plundered [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Byzantine Corinth|Corinth]]. However, despite being distracted by a [[Cuman]] attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of [[Conrad III of Germany]], and the help of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent [[George of Antioch]] with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nor&quot;&gt;J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 98 and 103&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy for the rest of his reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;M621&quot; /&gt;

Roger died in February 1154 and was succeeded by [[William I of Sicily|William I]], who faced widespread rebellions against his rule in [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Apulia]], leading to the presence of Apulian refugees at the Byzantine court. Conrad's successor, [[Frederick Barbarossa]], launched a campaign against the Normans, but his expedition stalled. These developments encouraged Manuel to take advantage of the multiple instabilities on the [[Italian peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;D122&quot;&gt;J. Duggan, ''The Pope and the Princes'', 122&lt;/ref&gt; He sent [[Michael Palaiologos (general)|Michael Palaiologos]] and [[John Doukas (megas hetaireiarches)|John Doukas]], both of whom held the high imperial rank of ''[[sebastos]]'', with Byzantine troops, ten ships, and large quantities of gold to invade Apulia in 1155.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 114&lt;br /&gt;* J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 112&lt;/ref&gt; The two generals were instructed to enlist the support of Frederick, but he declined because his demoralised army longed to get back north of the Alps as soon as possible.{{Cref|b}} Nevertheless, with the help of disaffected local barons, including Count [[Robert II of Bassunvilla|Robert of Loritello]], Manuel's expedition achieved astonishingly rapid progress as the whole of [[Mezzogiorno|southern Italy]] rose up in rebellion against the Sicilian Crown and the untried William I.&lt;ref name=&quot;M621&quot; /&gt; There followed a string of spectacular successes as numerous strongholds yielded either to force or the lure of gold.&lt;ref name=Norwich /&gt;

===Papal-Byzantine alliance===
The city of [[Bari]], which had been the capital of the Byzantine [[Catapanate of Italy]] for centuries before the arrival of the Normans, opened its gates to the Emperor's army, and the overjoyed citizens tore down the Norman citadel. After the fall of Bari, the cities of [[Trani, Apulia|Trani]], [[Giovinazzo]], [[Andria]], [[Taranto]], and [[Brindisi]] were also captured. William arrived with his army, including 2,000 knights, but was heavily defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;N112-113&quot;&gt;J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by the success, Manuel dreamed of restoration of the Roman Empire, at the cost of union between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], a prospect which would frequently be offered to the Pope during negotiations and plans for alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vas7&quot;&gt;[[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|A. A. Vasiliev]], ''History of the Byzantine Empire'', [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0832/_P1A.HTM VII]&lt;/ref&gt; If there was ever a chance of reuniting the eastern and western churches, and coming to reconciliation with the Pope permanently, this was probably the most favourable moment. The [[Papacy]] was never on good terms with the Normans, except when under duress by the threat of direct military action. Having the &quot;civilised&quot; Byzantines on its southern border was infinitely preferable to the Papacy than having to constantly deal with the troublesome Normans of Sicily. It was in the interest of [[Pope Adrian IV]] to reach a deal if at all possible, since doing so would greatly increase his own influence over the entire Orthodox Christian population. Manuel offered a large sum of money to the Pope for the provision of troops, with the request that the Pope grant the Byzantine emperor lordship of three maritime cities in return for assistance in expelling William from Sicily. Manuel also promised to pay 5,000 pounds of gold to the Pope and the [[Papal Curia|Curia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;W18-2&quot;&gt;William of Tyre, ''Historia'', XVIII, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/18.html#2 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations were hurriedly carried out, and an alliance was formed between Manuel and Hadrian.&lt;ref name=&quot;D122&quot; /&gt;

At this point, just as the war seemed decided in his favour, events turned against Manuel. Byzantine commander Michael Palaiologos alienated allies with his attitude, stalling the campaign as Count [[Robert III of Loritello]] refused to speak to him. Although the two were reconciled, the campaign had lost some of its momentum: Michael was soon recalled to Constantinople, and his loss was a major blow to the campaign. The turning point was the [[Battle of Brindisi (1156)|Battle of Brindisi]], where the Sicilians launched a major counterattack by both land and sea. At the approach of the enemy, the mercenaries that had been hired with Manuel's gold demanded huge increases in their pay. When this was refused, they deserted. Even the local barons started to melt away, and soon John Doukas was left hopelessly outnumbered. The arrival of [[Alexios Komnenos Bryennios]] with some ships failed to retrieve the Byzantine position.{{Cref|d}} The naval battle was decided in favour of the Sicilians, while John Doukas and Alexios Bryennios (along with four Byzantine ships) were captured.&lt;ref name=&quot;B115&quot;&gt;J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 115&lt;br /&gt;* J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 115&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel then sent [[Alexios Axouch]] to [[Ancona]] to raise another army, but by this time William had already retaken all of the Byzantine conquests in Apulia. The defeat at Brindisi put an end to the restored Byzantine reign in Italy; in 1158 the Byzantine army left Italy and never returned again.&lt;ref&gt;J. W.

Vasiliev, ''History of the Byzantine Empire'', [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0832/_P1A.HTM VII]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Nicetas Choniates]] and Kinnamos, the major Byzantine historians of this period, agree, however, that the peace terms Axouch secured from William allowed Manuel to extricate himself from the war with dignity, despite a devastating raid by a Sicilian fleet of 164 ships (carrying 10,000 men) on [[Euboea]] and [[Almyros|Almira]] in 1156.&lt;ref name=&quot;M61J&quot;&gt;J.

===Failure of the Church union===

During the Italian campaign, and afterwards, during the struggle of the Papal Curia with Frederick, Manuel tried to sway the popes with hints of a possible union between the Eastern and Western churches. Although in 1155 Pope Hadrian had expressed his eagerness to prompt the reunion of the churches,{{Cref|e}} hopes for a lasting Papal-Byzantine alliance came up against insuperable problems. [[Pope Adrian IV]] and his successors demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere and sought superiority over the Byzantine Emperor; they were not at all willing to fall into a state of dependence from one emperor to the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vas7&quot; /&gt; Manuel, on the other hand, wanted an official recognition of his secular authority over both East and West.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 114&lt;/ref&gt; Such conditions would not be accepted by either side. Even if a pro-western emperor such as Manuel agreed, the Greek citizens of the empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort, as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the pope. In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman Church and his cordial relations with all the popes, Manuel was never honoured with the title of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|augustus]]'' by the popes. And although he twice sent embassies to [[Pope Alexander III]] (in 1167 and 1169) offering to reunite the Greek and Latin churches, Alexander refused, under pretext of the troubles that would follow union.&lt;ref name=&quot;AGB&quot;&gt;Abbé Guettée, ''The Papacy'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20040322110754/http://www.geocities.com/trvalentine/orthodox/guettee10.html Chapter VII]&lt;br /&gt;* J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 114&lt;/ref&gt;

The final results of the Italian campaign were limited in terms of the advantages gained by the Empire. The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting the Emperor as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came to terms with the Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel's reign. The Empire's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of what money and diplomacy alone could achieve. The expense of Manuel's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal (probably more than 2,160,000 ''hyperpyra'' or 30,000 pounds of gold), and yet it produced only limited solid gains.&lt;ref name=&quot;B116&quot;&gt;J.

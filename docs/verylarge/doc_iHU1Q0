===Amin and the Soviet intervention: 1979===
[[File:Hafizullah Amin.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Hafizullah Amin|Amin]] ruled Afghanistan for 104 days]]

While [[Hafizullah Amin|Amin]] and [[Nur Muhammad Taraki|Taraki]] had a very close relationship at the beginning, the relationship soon deteriorated. Amin who had helped to create a [[personality cult]] centered on Taraki, soon became disgusted with the shape it took and with Taraki, who had begun to believe in his own brilliance. Taraki began dismissing Amin's suggestions, fostering in Amin a deep sense of resentment. As their relationship turned increasingly sour, a power struggle developed between them for control over the [[Afghan Army]].{{sfn|Misdaq|2006|p=122}} Following the [[1979 Herat uprising]], the Revolutionary Council and the [[Politburo of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Politburo]] established the [[Homeland Higher Defence Council]]. Taraki was elected its chairman, while Amin became its deputy. Amin's appointment, and the acquisition of the Council of Ministers chairmanship, was not a step further up the ladder as one might assume; due to constitutional reforms, Amin's new offices were more or less powerless.{{sfn|Misdaq|2006|p=123}} There was a failed assassination attempt led by the Gang of Four, which consisted of Watanjar, [[Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy]], [[Sherjan Mazdoryar]] and [[Assadullah Sarwari]]. This assassination attempt prompted Amin to conspire against Taraki,{{sfn|Misdaq|2006|p=125}} and when Taraki returned from a trip to [[Havana]],{{sfn|Misdaq|2006|p=123–124}} he was ousted, and later suffocated on Amin's orders.{{sfn|Misdaq|2006|p=125}}

During his short stay in power (104 days), Amin became committed to establishing a [[collective leadership]]. When Taraki was ousted, Amin promised &quot;from now on there will be no [[Autocracy|one-man government]] ...&quot;{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA192 192]}}'&lt;ref&gt;https://newleftreview.org/issues/I119/articles/fred-halliday-the-war-and-revolution-in-afghanistan The War and Revolution in Afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet intervention]], the PDPA executed between 1,000 and 7,000 people, mostly at [[Pul-e-Charkhi prison]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Valentino2005FinalSolutions|Valentino (2005) ''Final solutions'']] p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert D., ''Soldiers of God: With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan and Pakistan'', New York, Vintage Departures, (2001), p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4756480.stm Kabul's prison of death] [[BBC]], 27 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The total number arrested during Taraki's and Amin's rule combined, lays somewhere in between 17,000 and 25,000.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA273 273]}} Amin was not liked by the Afghan people. During his rule, opposition to the [[communist regime]] increased, and the government lost control over the countryside. The state of the [[Afghan military]] deteriorated under Amin; due to desertions the number of military personnel in the Afghan army decreased from 100,000, in the immediate aftermath of the Saur Revolution, to somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. Another problem was that the KGB had penetrated the PDPA, the military and the government bureaucracy.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA160 160]}} While his position in Afghanistan was becoming more perilous by the day, his enemies who were exiled in the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]], were agitating for his removal. [[Babrak Karmal]], the Parchamite leader, met several leading Eastern Bloc figures during this period, and [[Mohammad Aslam Watanjar]], [[Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy]] and [[Assadullah Sarwari]] wanted to exact revenge on Amin.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA160 160–161]}}

{{History of Afghanistan}}

Meantime in the Soviet Union, the Special Commission of the Politburo on Afghanistan which consisted of [[Yuri Andropov]], [[Andrei Gromyko]], [[Dmitriy Ustinov]] and [[Boris Ponomarev]] wanted to end the impression that the Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policies.{{sfn|Tripathi|Falk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDf8p060_JgC&amp;pg=PA54 54]}} Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, telling [[Leonid Brezhnev]] that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capability to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to amass a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal.{{sfn|Tripathi|Falk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDf8p060_JgC&amp;pg=PA55 55]}} The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated [[Operation Storm-333]] (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.{{sfn|Camp|2012|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yMmx1m_ZCqEC&amp;pg=PA12 12–13]}}

Amin remained trustful of the Soviet Union until the very end, despite the deterioration of official relations with the Soviet Union. When the Afghan intelligence service handed Amin a report that the Soviet Union would invade the country, and topple him, Amin claimed the report was a product of [[imperialism]]. His view can be explained by the fact that the Soviet Union, after several months, decided to send troops into Afghanistan.{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGG-x_tuNUcC&amp;pg=PA1009 1009]}} Contrary to normal Western beliefs, Amin was informed of the Soviet decision to send troops into Afghanistan.{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGG-x_tuNUcC&amp;pg=PA1017 1017]}} Amin was killed by Soviet forces on 27 December 1979.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=99}}

===The Karmal Era: 1979–1986===
Karmal ascended to power following Amin's assassination.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=99}} On 27 December [[Radio Kabul]] broadcast Karmal's pre-recorded speech, which stated &quot;Today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed, his accomplices – the primitive executioners, usurpers and murderers of tens of thousand of our fellow countrymen – fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters, children and old people ...&quot; On 1 January [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], and [[Alexei Kosygin]], the Soviet [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]], congratulated Karmal on his &quot;election&quot; as leader, before any Afghan state or party organ had elected him to anything.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|pp=103–104}}

When he came to power, Karmal promised an end to executions, the establishment of democratic institutions and free elections, the creation of a constitution, the legalisation of parties other than the PDPA, and respect for individual and personal property. Prisoners incarcerated under the two previous governments would be freed in a general amnesty. He even promised that a coalition government was going to be established, which was not going to espouse [[socialism]]. At the same time, he told the Afghan people that he had negotiated with the Soviet Union to give economic, military and political assistance. Even if Karmal indeed wanted all this, it would be impossible to put it into practice in the presence of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|H. Kakar|M. Kakar|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QyTmFj5tUGsC&amp;pg=PA71 71]}} Most Afghans mistrusted the government at this time. Many still remembered that Karmal had said he would protect private capital in 1978, a promise later proven to be a lie.{{sfn|H. Kakar|M. Kakar|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QyTmFj5tUGsC&amp;pg=PA71 71–72] }}

When a political solution failed, the Afghan government and the Soviet military decided to solve the conflict militarily. The change from a political to a military solution came gradually. It began in January 1981: Karmal doubled wages for military personnel, issued several promotions, and one general and thirteen colonels were decorated. The draft age was lowered, the obligatory length of military duty was extended, and the age for reservists was increased to thirty-five years of age. In June, [[Assadullah Sarwari]] lost his seat in the PDPA Politburo, and in his place were appointed [[Mohammad Aslam Watanjar]], a former tank commander and the then [[Ministry of Communications (Afghanistan)|Minister of Communications]], [[Major General]] [[Mohammad Rafi (politician)|Mohammad Rafi]], the [[Ministry of Defence (Afghanistan)|Minister of Defence]] and [[KHAD]] Chairman [[Mohammad Najibullah]]. These measures were introduced due to the collapse of the army; before the invasion the army could field 100,000 troops, after the invasion only 25,000. Desertion was pandemic, and the recruitment campaigns for young people often led them to flee to the opposition.{{sfn|Weiner|Banuazizi|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&amp;pg=PA47 47]}} To better organise the military, seven military zones were established each with its own Defence Council. The Defence Council was established at the national, provincial and district level to devolve powers to the local PDPA.{{sfn|Weiner|Banuazizi|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&amp;pg=PA48 48]}} It is estimated that the Afghan government spent as much as 40 percent of government revenue on defence.{{sfn|Staff writer|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=e5Az1lGCJwQC&amp;pg=PA86 86]}}

Karmal was forced to resign from his post as PDPA General Secretary in May 1985, due to increasing pressure from the Soviet leadership. In his post as PDPA General Secretary he was succeeded by Najibullah, the former [[KHAD|Minister of State Security]].{{sfn|Kalinovsky|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rf1Yg2SGLQgC&amp;pg=PA97 97]}} He continued to have influence in the upper echelons of the party and state, until he was forced to resign from his post of Revolutionary Council Chairman in November 1986. Karmal was succeeded by [[Haji Mohammad Chamkani]], who was not a member of the PDPA.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a0Mp1AHpp0gC&amp;pg=PA152 151–152]}}

===Najibullah and the Soviet withdrawal: 1986–1989===
In September 1986 the National Compromise Commission (NCC) was established on the orders of Najibullah. The NCC's goal was to contact [[counter-revolutionaries]] &quot;in order to complete the [[Saur Revolution]] in its new phase.&quot; An estimated 40,000 rebels were contacted by the government. At the end of 1986, Najibullah called for a six-month ceasefire and talks between the various opposition forces, as part of his policy of [[National Reconciliation]]. The discussions, if fruitful, would have led to the establishment of a coalition government and be the end of the PDPA's monopoly on power. The programme failed, but the government was able to recruit disillusioned mujahideen fighters as government militias.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a0Mp1AHpp0gC&amp;pg=PA152 152]}} The National Reconciliation did lead an increasing number of urban dwellers to support his rule, and to the stabilisation of the Afghan defence forces.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a0Mp1AHpp0gC&amp;pg=PA153 153]}}

While Najibullah may have been the ''[[de jure]]'' leader of Afghanistan, Soviet advisers still did most of the work after Najibullah took power. As Gorbachev remarked &quot;We're still doing everything ourselves [...]. That's all our people know how to do. They've tied Najibullah hand and foot.&quot;{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA276 276]}} [[Fikryat Tabeev]], the [[Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan]], was accused of acting like a Governor General by Gorbachev, and he was recalled from Afghanistan in July 1986. But while Gorbachev called for the end of Soviet management of Afghanistan, he could not resist doing some managing himself. At a Soviet Politburo meeting, Gorbachev said, &quot;It's difficult to build a new building out of old material [...] I hope to God that we haven't made a mistake with Najibullah.&quot;{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA276 276]}} As time would prove, Najibullah's aims were the opposite of the Soviet Union's; Najibullah was opposed to a Soviet withdrawal, the Soviet Union wanted a withdrawal. This was understandable, since the Afghan military was on the brink of dissolution. Najibullah thought his only means of survival was to retain the Soviet presence.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA276 276]}} In July 1986 six Soviet regiments, up to 15,000 troops, were withdrawn from Afghanistan. The aim of this early withdrawal was, according to Gorbachev, to show the world that the Soviet leadership was serious about leaving Afghanistan.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA277 277]}} The Soviets told the United States Government that they were planning to withdraw, but the United States Government didn't believe it. When Gorbachev met with [[Ronald Reagan]] during his visit the United States, Reagan called, bizarrely, for the dissolution of the Afghan army.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA280 280]}}

On 14 April the Afghan and Pakistani governments signed the 1988 [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]], and the Soviet Union and the United States signed as guarantors; the treaty specifically stated that the Soviet military had to withdraw from Afghanistan by 15 February 1989.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA281 281]}} During a Politburo meeting [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] said &quot;We will leave the country in a deplorable situation&quot;,{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA282 282]}} and talked further about economic collapse, and the need to keep at least 10,000 to 15,000 troops in Afghanistan. [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], the [[KGB Chairman]], supported this position. This stance, if implemented, would be a betrayal of the Geneva Accords just signed.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA282 282]}} Najibullah was against any type of Soviet withdrawal.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA286 286]}} A few Soviet troops remained after the Soviet withdrawal; for instance, parachutists who protected the Soviet embassy staff, military advisors and [[special forces]] and reconnaissance troops still operated in the &quot;outlying provinces&quot;, especially along the Afghan–Soviet border.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA294 294]}}

===The fall: 1989–1992===
Pakistan, under [[Zia ul-Haq]], continued to support the mujahideen even though it was a contravention of the Geneva Accords. At the beginning most observers expected the Najibullah government to collapse immediately, and to be replaced with an Islamic fundamentalist government. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] stated in a report, that the new government would be ambivalent, or even worse hostile, towards the United States. Almost immediately after the Soviet withdrawal, the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1989–1992)#Battle of Jalalabad|Battle of Jalalabad]] was fought between Afghan government forces and the [[mujahideen]]; the government forces, to the surprise of many, repulsed the attack and won the battle.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA296 296]}} This trend would not continue, and by the summer of 1990, the Afghan government forces were on the defensive again. By the beginning of 1991, the government controlled only 10 percent of Afghanistan, the eleven-year [[Siege of Khost]] had ended in a mujahideen victory and the morale of the Afghan military finally collapsed. It didn't help that the Soviet Union was falling apart itself;{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA299 299]}} hundreds of millions of dollars of yearly economic aid to Najibullah's government from Moscow dried up.{{sfn|Lavigne|1992|page=68}}

In March, Najibullah offered his government's immediate resignation, and following an agreement with the [[United Nations]] (UN), his government was replaced by an interim government. In mid-April Najibullah accepted a UN plan to hand power to a seven-man council. A few days later, on 14 April, Najibullah was forced to resign on the orders of the Watan Party, because of the loss of Bagram airbase and the town of [[Charikar]]. [[Abdul Rahim Hatef]] became acting head of state following Najibullah's resignation.{{sfn|Staff writer|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=e5Az1lGCJwQC&amp;pg=PA66 66]}} Najibullah, not long before Kabul's fall, appealed to the UN for amnesty, which he was granted. But Najibullah was hindered by [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] from escaping; instead, Najibullah sought haven in the local UN headquarters in Kabul.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA301 301]}} The [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|war in Afghanistan]] did not end with Najibullah's ouster, and continues until today.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQQKejG3qUC&amp;pg=PA302 302–303]}}

==Politics==

===Political system===
The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan described the [[Saur Revolution]] as a democratic revolution signifying &quot;a victory of the honourable working people of Afghanistan&quot; and the &quot;manifestation of the real will and interests of workers, peasants and toilers.&quot;{{sfn|Kamali|1985|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ksC-BL2WivUC&amp;pg=PA62]}} While the idea of moving Afghanistan toward socialism was proclaimed, completing the task was seen as an arduous road. Thus, Afghanistan's foreign minister commented that Afghanistan was a democratic but not yet socialist republic, while a member of the [[Politburo of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] predicted that &quot;Afghanistan will not see socialism in my lifetime&quot; in an interview with a [[United Kingdom|British]] journalist in 1981.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA63 63]}}

Afghanistan was considered by the Soviet Union as a state with a socialist orientation.{{sfn|Saikal|Maley|1989|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KWsqVYSBTYIC&amp;pg=PA106 106]}} The Soviets, in mid-1979, initially proclaimed Afghanistan as not merely a progressive ally, but a fully fledged member of the socialist community of nations. In contrast, later Soviet rhetoric invariably referred to the Saur Revolution as a democratic turn, but stopped short of recognizing a socialist society.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA105 105]}}

Under [[Hafizullah Amin]], a commission working on a new constitution was established. There were 65 members of this commission, and they came from all walks of life.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA94 94]}} Due to his death, his constitution was never finished. In April 1980, under [[Babrak Karmal]], the [[Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] were made law.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA107 107–108]}} The constitution was devoid of any references to [[socialism]] or [[communism]], and instead laid emphasis on independence, [[Islam]] and [[liberal democracy]]. Religion was to be respected, the exception being when religion threatened the security of society. The Fundamental Principles were, in many ways, similar to [[Mohammad Daoud Khan]]'s [[1977 Afghan Constitution|1977 constitution]]. While official ideology was de-emphasized, the PDPA did not lose its monopoly on power, and the [[Revolutionary Council (Afghanistan)|Revolutionary Council]] continued to be ruled through its Presidium, the majority of Presidium members were from the PDPA Politburo. The Karmal government was &quot;a new evolutionary phase of the great [[Saur Revolution]].&quot;{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA108 108]}} The Fundamental Principles was not implemented in practice, and it was replaced by the [[1987 Afghan Constitution|1987 constitution]] under [[Muhammad Najibullah]]. Islamic principles were embedded in the 1987 constitution. For instance, Article 2 of the constitution stated that [[Islam]] was the [[state religion]], and Article 73 stated that the head of state had to be born into a Muslim Afghan family. In 1990, the 1987 constitution was amended to state that Afghanistan was an [[Islamic republic]], and the last references to [[communism]] were removed.{{sfn|Yassari|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CMGfLzYWeW4C&amp;pg=PA15 15]}} Article 1 of the amended constitution said that Afghanistan was an &quot;independent, unitary and Islamic state.&quot;{{sfn|Otto|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ep7cX3ma0sC&amp;pg=PA289 289]}}

The 1987 constitution liberalized the political landscape in areas under government control. Political parties could be established as long as they opposed [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]], [[neo-colonialism]], [[Zionism]], [[racial discrimination]], [[apartheid]] and [[fascism]]. The Revolutionary Council was abolished, and replaced by the [[National Assembly of Afghanistan]], a democratically elected parliament.{{sfn|Giustozzi|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz5NzJtg48kC&amp;pg=PA161 161]}} The government announced its willingness to share power, and form a coalition government. The new parliament was [[bicameral]], and consisted of a Senate (Sena) and a House of Representatives ([[Wolesi Jirga]]). The president was to be indirectly elected to a 7-year term.{{sfn|Staff writer|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=e5Az1lGCJwQC&amp;pg=PA65 65]}} A [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1988|parliamentary election was held in 1988]]. The PDPA won 46 seats in the House of Representatives and controlled the government with support from the [[National Front (Afghanistan)|National Front]], which won 45 seats, and from various newly recognized left-wing parties, which had won a total of 24 seats. Although the election was boycotted by the [[Mujahideen]], the government left 50 of the 234 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as a small number of seats in the Senate, vacant in the hope that the guerillas would end their armed struggle and participate in the government. The only armed opposition party to make peace with the government was [[Hizbollah (Afghanistan)|Hizbollah]], a small [[Shi'a]] party not to be confused with the bigger party in Iran.{{sfn|Giustozzi|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz5NzJtg48kC&amp;pg=PA161 161]}}

The [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Council of Ministers]] was the Afghan cabinet, and its chairman was the head of government. It was the most important government body in PDPA Afghanistan, and it ran the governmental ministries.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=58}} The Council of Ministers was responsible to the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council, and after the adoption if the 1987 constitution, to the President and House of Representatives. There seems to have been a deliberate power-sharing between the two bodies; few Presidium members were ministers.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=59}} It was the PDPA (perhaps with the involvement of the Soviets) which appointed and decided the membership of the Council of Ministers.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|pp=60–61}} An Afghan dissident who had previously worked in the office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers reported that all topics up for discussion in the Council of Ministers had to be approved by the Soviets.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=288}} Under Karmal, the Khalqist's were purged and replaced by the Parcham majority in the Council of Ministers. Of the 24 members of the Council of Ministers under Karmal's chairmanship, only four were Khalqists.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|pp=65–66}}

====The PDPA====
{{main|People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan}}
[[File:Emblem of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.svg|thumb|The emblem of the PDPA]]
The PDPA constitution was written during the party's First Congress in 1965. The constitution regulated all party activities, and modelled itself after the [[Leninism|Leninist party model]]; the party was based on the principles of [[democratic centralism]]. [[Marxism–Leninism]] was the party's official ideology.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA170 170]}} In theory, the [[Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|Central Committee]] ruled Afghanistan by electing the members to the [[Revolutionary Council (Afghanistan)|Revolutionary Council]], [[Secretariat of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|Secretariat]] and the [[Politburo of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|Politburo]], the key decision-making bodies of state and party.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA62 62]}} After the Soviet intervention, the powers of the PDPA decreased because of the government's increased unpopularity amongst the masses. Soviet advisers took over nearly all aspects of Afghan administration – according to critics, the Afghans became the advisors and the Soviet became the advised. The Soviet intervention had forced Karmal upon the party and state. While trying to portray the new government as a [[Khalq]]–[[Parcham]] coalition, most members (the majority of whom were Khalqists), saw through the lies.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA99 99–100]}} At the time of the Parchamite takeover of the state and party, an estimated 80 percent of military officers were Khalqists.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA100 100]}}

In the party's history, only two congresses were held; the founding congress in 1965 and the Second Congress in June 1990, which transformed the PDPA into the Watan Party,{{sfn|Raciopi|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jiUic1s7djMC&amp;pg=PA161 161]}} which has survived to this today in the shape of the [[Democratic Watan Party]]. The Second Congress renamed the party, and tried to revitalise it by admitting to past mistakes and evolving ideologically. The policy of [[national reconciliation]] was given a major ideologically role, since the party now looked for a peaceful solution to the conflict. [[Class struggle]] was still emphasised. The party also decided to support, and further develop the [[market economy]] in Afghanistan.{{sfn|Raciopi|1994|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jiUic1s7djMC&amp;pg=PA161 161–162]}}

=====Factions=====
* The Khalq faction was the more militant of the two. It was more revolutionary, and believed in a purer form of Marxism–Leninism than did the Parcham.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA38 38]}} Following the Soviet intervention, the Khalqi leadership of Taraki and Amin had been all but driven out. But, several low and middle level functionaries were still present in the PDPA, and they still formed a majority within the armed forces; the Khalq faction still managed to create a sense of cohesion. While still believing in Marxism–Leninism, many of them were infuriated at the Soviet intervention, and the Soviet's pro-Parchamite policies.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA111 111]}} Taraki, in a speech, said &quot;We will defend our non-aligned policy and independence with all valour. We will not give even an inch of soil to anyone and we will not be dictated in our foreign policy [nor] will we accept anybody's orders in this regard.&quot; While it was not clear, who Taraki was pointing at, the Soviet Union was the only country which Afghanistan neighbored which had the strength to occupy the country.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA85 85]}}

* The Parcham faction was the more moderate of the two, and was steadfastly pro-Soviet. This position would hurt its popularity when it came to power following the Soviet intervention. Before the [[Saur Revolution]], the Parcham faction had been the Soviets' favored faction.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA55 55]}} Following the Parchamites' seizure of power with Soviet assistance, party discipline was breaking down because of the Khalq–Parcham feud. After the PDPA government had ordered the replacement of seven Khalqist officers with Parchamites, the seven officers sent the intended replacements back. While the Parchamite government gave up trying to take over the armed forces, it did announce the execution of 13 officials who had worked for Amin. These executions led to three failed Khalqist coups in June, July and October 1980.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA112 112]}} The Western press, during the anti-Parchamite purge of 1979, referred to the Parcham faction as &quot;moderate socialist intellectuals&quot;.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA86 86]}}

Throughout PDPA history there were also other factions, such as the [[Guruh-i Kar|Kar faction]] led by [[Dastagir Panjsheri]], who later became a Khalqist, and [[Settam-e-Melli]] formed and led by [[Tahir Badakhshi]].{{sfn|Arnold|1983|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA39 39–40]}} The Settam-e-Melli was a part of the insurgency against the PDPA regime. In 1979 a Settam-e-Melli group killed [[Adolph Dubs]], the [[United States Ambassador to Afghanistan]].{{sfn|Girardet|1985|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1c0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA114 114]}} Ideologically Settam-e-Melli was very close to the Khalqist faction, but Settam-e-Melli opposed what they saw as the Khalq faction's &quot;Pashtun chauvinism.&quot;{{sfn|Weiner|Banuazizi|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&amp;pg=PA71 71]}} Settam-e-Melli followed the ideology of [[Maoism]].{{sfn|Christensen|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7LKS93lbSM0C&amp;pg=PA24 24]}} When Karmal ascended to power, the Settamites relationship with the government improved, mostly due to Karmal's former good relationship with Badakhshi,{{sfn|Dorronsoro|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3DOuOSYR4PcC&amp;pg=PA185 185]}} who was killed by government forces in 1979.{{sfn|H.

===National Front===
{{main|National Front (Afghanistan)}}
Karmal had first mentioned the possibility of establishing a &quot;broad national front&quot; in March 1980, but given the situation the country was in, the campaign for the establishment of such an organisation began only in January 1981. A &quot;spontaneous&quot; demonstration in support of establishing such an organisation was held that month. The first pre-front institution to be established was a tribal Jirgah in May 1981 by the [[Ministry of Tribal Affairs (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Tribal Affairs]].{{sfn|Giustozzi|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz5NzJtg48kC&amp;pg=PA142 142]}} This jirgah later became a member of the front.{{sfn|Giustozzi|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz5NzJtg48kC&amp;pg=PA142 142–143]}} The National Fatherland Front (NFF) held its founding congress in June 1981,{{sfn|Weiner|Banuazizi|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&amp;pg=PA46 46]}} after being postponed on several occasions. The founding congress, which was planned to last four days, lasted only one.{{sfn|Giustozzi|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz5NzJtg48kC&amp;pg=PA143 143]}} Within one month of its founding, 27 senior members had been assassinated by the [[mujahideen]]. Due to this, the organisation took time to establish itself; its first Provincial Committee was established in November, and its first jirgah in December. It was not until 1983 that the NFF became an active, and important organisation.{{sfn|Giustozzi|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz5NzJtg48kC&amp;pg=PA143 143]}} The aim of the NFF was to establish a pro-PDPA organisation for those who did not support the PDPA ideologically.{{sfn|Giustozzi|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz5NzJtg48kC&amp;pg=PA142 142]}}

Its first leader was [[Salah Mohammad Zeary]], a prominent politician within the PDPA. Zeary's selection had wider implications: the PDPA dominated all NFF activities. Officially, the NFF had amassed 700,000 members after its founding, which later increased to one million. The majority of its members were already members of affiliated organisations, such as the [[Afghan Women's Council|Women's Council]], the [[Democratic Youth Organisation]] and the trade unions, all of which were controlled by the PDPA. The membership numbers were in any case inflated: actually in 1984 the NFF had 67,000 members, and in 1986 its membership peaked at 112,209. In 1985 Zeary stepped down as NFF leader, and was succeeded by [[Abdul Rahim Hatef]], who was not a member of the PDPA.{{sfn|Giustozzi|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz5NzJtg48kC&amp;pg=PA143 143]}} The ascension of Hatef proved more successful, and in 1985–86 the NFF succeeded in recruiting several &quot;good Muslims&quot;.{{sfn|Giustozzi|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz5NzJtg48kC&amp;pg=PA143 143–144]}} The NFF was renamed the National Front in 1987.{{sfn|Adamec|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tp5IrLhWbTkC&amp;pg=PT528 528]}}

On 19 October 1978 the PDPA government introduced a new flag, a red flag with a yellow seal, and it was similar to the flags of the [[Soviet Central Asia]]n republics.{{sfn|Edwards|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=biOdjgEO-IcC&amp;pg=PA30 30]}} The new flag stirred popular resentment, many Afghans saw it as proof of the PDPA government's secular nature.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA133 133]}} It was shown to the public for the first time in an official rally in Kabul.{{sfn|Runion|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aZk9XzqCFGUC&amp;pg=PA106 106]}} The red flag introduced under Taraki was replaced in 1980, shortly after the Soviet intervention, to the more traditional colours black, red and green.

Taraki's Government initiated a [[land reform]] on 1 January 1979, which attempted to limit the amount of land a family could own. Those whose landholdings exceeded the limit saw their property requisitioned by the government without compensation. The Afghan leadership believed the reform would meet with popular approval among the rural population while weakening the power of the [[bourgeoisie]]. The reform was declared complete in mid-1979 and the government proclaimed that 665,000 hectares (approximately 1,632,500 acres) had been redistributed. The government also declared that only 40,000 families, or 4 percent of the population, had been negatively affected by the land reform.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA315 315]}}

Contrary to government expectations the reform was neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests plummeted and the reform itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA315 315]}} When Taraki realized the degree of popular dissatisfaction with the reform he quickly abandoned the policy.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|pp=315–316}} However, the land reform was gradually implemented under the later Karmal administration, although the proportion of land area affected by the reform is unclear.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=316}}

During the civil war, and the ensuing [[Soviet–Afghan War]], most of the country's infrastructure was destroyed, and normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afghanistans.com/Information/Economy/default.htm |title=Economy |publisher=Afghanistan.com |accessdate=1 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205010307/http://www.afghanistans.com/information/Economy/default.htm |archivedate=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gross national product]] (GNP) fell substantially during Karmal's rule because of the conflict; trade and transport were disrupted along with the loss of labor and capital. In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3 billion [[Afghan afghani]]s, a drop from 159,7 billion in 1978. [[GNP per capita]] decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The most dominant form of economic activity was the [[Agriculture in Afghanistan|agricultural sector]]. Agriculture accounted for 63 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 1981; 56 percent of the labour force worked in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 percent of GDP in 1982, and employed 10 percent of the labour force. All industrial enterprises were [[government-owned]]. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 percent of GDP in 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The [[balance of payments]], which had improved in the pre-communist administration of [[Muhammad Daoud Khan]]; the surplus decreased and became a deficit by 1982, which reached minus $US70.3 million. The only economic activity that grew substantially during Karmal's rule was [[export]] and [[import]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/country.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011106230711/http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/country.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 November 2001 |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |publisher=[[Illinois Institute of Technology]] |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Najibullah continued Karmal's economic policies. The augmenting of links with the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the Soviet Union continued, as did bilateral trade. He also encouraged the development of the private sector in industry. The [[Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan]], which was introduced in January 1986, continued until March 1991, one month before the government's fall. According to the plan, the economy, which had grown less than 2 percent annually until 1985, would grow 25 percent under the plan. Industry would grow 28 percent, agriculture 14–16 percent, domestic trade by 150 percent and foreign trade by 15 percent. None of these predictions were successful, and economic growth continued at 2%. {{sfn|Staff writer|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=e5Az1lGCJwQC&amp;pg=PA83 83]}} The [[1990 Afghan constitution|1990 constitution]] gave attention to the [[private sector]]. Article 20 covered the establishment of private firms, and Article 25 encouraged [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] in the private sector.{{sfn|Otto|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ep7cX3ma0sC&amp;pg=PA289 289]}}

==Military==

===Command and officer corps===
The army's chain of command began with the Supreme Commander, who also held the posts of PDPA General Secretary and head of state. The [[order of precedence]] continued with the [[Ministry of Defence (Afghanistan)|Minister of National Defence]], the Deputy Minister of National Defence, Chief of the General Staff, Chief of Army Operations, Air and Air Defence Commander and ended with the Chief of Intelligence.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA187 187]}}

Of the 8,000 strong officer corps in 1978, between 600 and 800 were [[communist]]s. An estimated 40 to 45 percent of these officers were educated in the Soviet Union, and of them, between 5 and 10 percent were members of the PDPA or communists.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA181 181]}} By the time of the Soviet intervention, the officer corps had decreased to 1,100 members. This decrease can be explained by the number of purges centered on the armed forces. The purge of the military began immediately after the PDPA took power. According to Mohammad Ayub Osmani, an officer who defected to the enemy, of the 282 Afghan officers who attended the [[Malinovsky Military Academy of Armored Forces]] in Moscow, an estimated 126 were executed by the authorities. Most of the officer corps, during the Soviet war and the ensuing civil war, were new recruits.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA182 182]}} The majority of officers were Khalqists, but after the Parchamites' ascension to power, Khalqists held no position of significance. The Parchamites, who were the minority, held the positions of power. Of the 1,100 large officer corps, only an estimated 200 were party members. According to [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan communist)|Abdul Qadir]], one-fifth of military personnel were party members, which meant that, if the military stood at 47,000, 9,000 were members of the PDPA. This number was, according to J. Bruce Amtstutz, an exaggeration.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA182 182]}}

The strength of the army was greatly weakened during the early stages of PDPA rule. One of the main reasons for the small size was that the Soviet military were afraid the Afghan army would defect ''[[en masse]]'' to the enemy if total personnel increased. There were several sympathisers of the [[mujahideen]] within the military.{{sfn|Isby|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k86jifnA3oYC&amp;pg=PA18 18]}} Even so, there were several elite units under the command of the Afghan army, for instance, the 26th Airborne Battalion, 444th, 37th and 38th Commando Brigades. The 26th Airborne Battalion proved politically unreliable, and in 1980 they initiated a rebellion against the PDPA government. The Commando Brigades were, in contrast, considered reliable and were used as mobile strike forces until they sustained excessive casualties. After sustaining these casualties the Commando Brigades were turned into battalions.{{sfn|Isby|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k86jifnA3oYC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}

Most soldiers were recruited for a three-year term, later extended to four-year terms in 1984. Each year, the Afghan army lost an estimated 15,000 soldiers, 10,000 from desertion and 5,000 from casualties sustained in battle.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA181 181]}} Everyone between 19 and 39 was eligible for conscription, the only exceptions were certain party members, or party members in certain tasks, Afghans who studied abroad, mostly in the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the Soviet Union, and one-child families or low earners. Unfortunately for the government, most people tried to evade conscription. So the government was forced to send army or police gangs to [[Impressment|recruit]] civilians to service. Even so, some people carried fake papers so they could evade conscription.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA183 183]}} A side effect of the lack of recruits was that veterans were forced into longer service, or re-recruited. Of the 60 people who graduated from [[Kabul University]] in 1982, (few male Afghans attended Kabul University between 1980 and 1983), 15 of them fled to [[Pakistan]] or began working for the mujahideen.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA183 183–184]}} The army's approach to conscription was [[carrot-and-stick]]. This policy was partially successful, and each year the government managed to induce 10,000 to 18,000 into the army. A general amnesty was announced in 1980 to army draft deserters from previous administrations. In 1982, students who served in the military, and graduated 10th grade in high school, would pass 11th and 12th grade and be given a scholarship. People who were conscripted after the 12th grade, could, after military service, attend whichever higher education facility they wanted. To stop army desertions, soldiers were quickly promoted to higher ranks.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA183 183]}}

The army consisted of 14 divisions, of these 11 were infantry and another three were armored, which were part of three military corps. While an infantry division was supposed to be composed of 4,000 to 8,000 men, between 1980 and 1983 a division normally mustered between 2,000 and 2,500. The strength of armored divisions in contrast were maintained, and stood at 4,000. During the Soviet war, the Afghan army used light weapons, and used neglected equipment. During the counter-insurgency, heavy equipment, tanks and artillery were most of the time, but not always, used and fired by Soviet soldiers. A problem faced the Afghan government, and the Soviet military—the degeneration of training for new military recruits; new recruits were being rushed into service, because the Afghan government and the Soviet military feared a total collapse of the government.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA188 188]}}

====Air Force====
As with the army, the majority of officers in the Air Force were Khalqists, but Parchamites held all the senior positions.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA182 182]}} Many in the Afghan Air Force were given education and training in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA312 312]}} The Air Force had throughout its history always been smaller than the Army.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA181 181]}} The majority of Air Force personnel were not considered politically reliable to fly strike missions against the mujahideen.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA186 186]}} Following the Soviet intervention, the Soviets grounded the Air Force. Afghans were not allowed in security zones at Afghan airports by the Soviets. Afghans were generally not allowed to fly the airplanes of the Afghan Air Force, but the Soviets could.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA184 184]}} Afghan helicopters were assigned to tasks considered non-sensitive by the Soviets, and the majority of Air Force personnel were not told about missions beforehand, because the Soviets were afraid that they would contact the enemy. In Afghan helicopter flights a Soviet adviser was always present, and commanded the Afghan pilot who flew the helicopter.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA184 184–185]}}

Although the Air Force could deploy 150 fixed-wing aircraft and 30 helicopters, the majority of airplanes and helicopters were grounded, due to maintenance issues or limited availability of crews. Among the fixed-wing aircraft in use were [[MiG-17]] and [[MiG-21]] fighters, [[Su-7]] and [[Su-17]] fighter-bombers, [[Ilyushin Il-18|IL-18]] and [[Ilyushin Il-28|IL-28]] bombers and [[An-2]], [[An-24]] and [[An-26]] transport aircraft. [[Mil Mi-2|MI-2]], [[Mil Mi-4|MI-4]], [[Mil Mi-8|MI-8]] and [[MI-24]] helicopters were used by the Air Force. Other Soviet equipment and weapons were used by the government. The Czech [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39]] jet trainers were the only non-Soviet equipment.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA186 186]}}

====Paramilitary====
The [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Interior]], a Khalqist stronghold, controlled the [[Sarandoy]], or officially, the &quot;Defenders of the Revolution&quot;, which was a militarized [[Gendarmerie]] force. The [[Ministry of Tribes and Frontiers (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Tribes and Frontiers]] controlled, until 1983 under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence, the frontier troops and the tribal militia.{{sfn|Isby|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k86jifnA3oYC&amp;pg=PA20 20]}} According to the Afghan government, the militia mustered an estimated 20,000 males. Those who worked in the Sarandoy were paid 162 dollars a month, a wage which was higher than that of Deputy Minister of National Defence before the [[Saur Revolution]]. However, there was a problem; the militia was even less disciplined and effective than the Afghan army. Several journalists from the [[First World]] reported that the government militia collaborated with the [[mujahideen]].{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA189 189]}}

==Demographics==

===Education===
{{further|Education in Afghanistan}}
During communist rule, the PDPA government reformed the education system; education was stressed for both sexes, and widespread literacy programmes were set up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa11/011/1999/en/ WOMEN IN AFGHANISTAN: Pawns in men's power struggles]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1988, women made up 40 percent of the doctors and 60 percent of the teachers at Kabul University; 440,000 female students were enrolled in different educational institutions and 80,000 more in literacy programs.&lt;ref&gt;Racist Scapegoating of Muslim Women - Down with Quebec's Niqab Ban!, Spartacist Canada, Summer 2010, No. 165&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quote|date=September 2019}}{{better source|date=September 2019}} Despite improvements, large percentage of the population remained illiterate.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Beginning with the Soviet intervention in 1979, successive wars virtually destroyed the nation's education system.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Most teachers fled during the wars to neighboring countries.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf Afghanistan country profile].

===Refugees===
{{main|Afghan refugees}}
Afghan refugees are Afghanistan nationals who have fled their country as a result of the ongoing [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan conflict]]. About six million people have fled the country, most to neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, making it the largest producer of refugees in the world.&lt;ref name= &quot;BBC News p. &quot;&gt;{{harvnb|BBC News|2013|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

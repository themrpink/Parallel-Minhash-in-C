[[File:Поляков - Тронная речь Николая II во время открытия I государственной думы в Зимнем дворце.jpg|thumb|Speech by Emperor Nicholas II on the opening of the [[First State Duma]] of the Russian Empire, 27 April 1906]]
The attacks on the Duma were not confined to its legislative powers.  By the time the Duma opened, it was missing crucial support from its populace, thanks in no small part to the government's return to Pre-Manifesto levels of suppression.  The Soviets were forced to lay low for a long time, while the [[zemstvos]] turned against the Duma when the issue of land appropriation came up.   The issue of land appropriation was the most contentious of the Duma's appeals.  The Duma proposed that the government distribute its treasury, &quot;monastic and imperial lands&quot;, and seize private estates as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; The Duma, in fact, was preparing to alienate some of its more affluent supporters, a decision that left the assembly without the necessary political power to be efficient.

Nicholas II remained wary of having to share power with reform-minded bureaucrats.  When the pendulum in 1906 elections swung to the left, Nicholas immediately ordered the Duma's dissolution just after 73 days.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sixsmith, Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East, pages 173&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to further squeeze the life out of the assembly, he appointed a tougher prime minister in [[Petr Stolypin]] as the liberal Witte's replacement.  Much to Nicholas's chagrin, Stolypin attempted to bring about acts of reform (land reform), while retaining measures favorable to the regime (stepping up the number of executions of revolutionaries).  After the revolution subsided, he was able to bring economic growth back to Russia's industries, a period which lasted until 1914.  But Stolypin's efforts did nothing to prevent the collapse of the monarchy, nor seemed to satisfy the conservatives.  Stolypin died from a bullet wound by a revolutionary, [[Dmitry Bogrov]], on 5 September 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sixsmith, Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East, pages 174&lt;/ref&gt;

===October Manifesto===

Even after Bloody Sunday and defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, Nicholas II had been slow to offer a meaningful solution to the social and political crisis.  At this point, he became more concerned with his personal affairs such as the illness of his son, whose struggle with [[haemophilia]] was overseen by [[Rasputin]]. Nicholas also refused to believe that the population was demanding changes in the autocratic regime, seeing &quot;public opinion&quot; as mainly the &quot;intelligentsia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sixsmith, ''Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East'', pages 171&lt;/ref&gt; and believing himself to be the patronly 'father figure' to the Russian people. [[Sergei Witte]], the minister of Russia, frustratingly argued with the Tsar that an immediate implementation of reforms was needed to retain order in the country.  It was only after the Revolution started picking up steam that Nicholas was forced to make concessions by writing the October Manifesto.

Issued on 17 October 1905, the Manifesto stated that the government would grant the population reforms such as the right to vote and to convene in assemblies.  Its main provisions were:
# The granting of the population &quot;inviolable personal rights&quot; including freedom of conscience, speech, and assemblage
# Giving the population who were previously cut off from doing so participation in the newly formed Duma
# Ensuring that no law would be passed without the consent of the Imperial Duma.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sixsmith, Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East, pages 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite what seemed to be a moment for celebration for Russia's population and the reformists, the Manifesto was rife with problems.  Aside from the absence of the word &quot;constitution&quot;, one issue with the manifesto was its timing.   By October 1905, Nicholas was already dealing with a revolution.  Another problem surfaced in the conscience of Nicholas himself:  Witte said in 1911 that the manifesto was written only to get the pressure off the monarch's back, that it was not a &quot;voluntary act&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kropotkin |first = G. M. |date = Spring 2008 |title = The Ruling Bureaucracy and the &quot;New Order&quot; of Russian Statehood After the Manifesto of 17 October 1905 |journal =  Russian Studies in History|volume = 46 |issue = 4 |pages = 6–33 |doi = 10.2753/RSH1061-1983460401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the writers hoped that the Manifesto would sow discord into &quot;the camp of the autocracy’s enemies&quot; and bring order back to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Kropotkin, ''The Ruling Bureaucracy and the &quot;New Order&quot; of Russian Statehood'', pages 9&lt;/ref&gt;

One immediate effect it did have, for a while, was the start of the Days of Freedom, a six-week period from 17 October to early December.  This period witnessed an unprecedented level of freedom on all publications—revolutionary papers, brochures, etc.—even though the tsar officially retained the power to censor provocative material.  This opportunity allowed the press to address the tsar, and government officials, in a harsh, critical tone previously unheard of.  The freedom of speech also opened the floodgates for meetings and organized political parties.  In Moscow alone, over 400 meetings took place in the first four weeks.  Some of the political parties that came out of these meetings were the [[Constitutional Democrats]] (Kadets), [[Social Democrats]], [[Socialist Revolutionaries]], [[Octobrists]], and the far-rightist Union of Russian People.&lt;ref&gt;Nader Sohrabi, ''Historicizing Revolutions'', page 1407&lt;/ref&gt;

Among all the groups that benefited most from the Days of Freedoms were the labor unions.  In fact, the Days of Freedom witnessed unionization in the history of the Russian Empire at its apex.  At least 67 unions were established in Moscow, as well as 58 in St. Petersburg; the majority of both combined were formed in November 1905 alone.  For the [[Soviets]], it was a watershed period of time: nearly 50 of the unions in St. Petersburg came under Soviet control, while in Moscow, the Soviets had around 80000 members.  This large sector of power allowed the Soviets enough clout to form their own militias.  In St. Petersburg alone, the Soviets claimed around 6,000 armed members with the purpose of protecting the meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Nader Sohrabi, ''Historicizing Revolutions'', pages 1407–1408&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps empowered in their newfound window of opportunity, the St. Petersburg Soviets, along with other socialist parties, called for armed struggles against the Tsarist government, a war call that no doubt alarmed the government.  Not only were the workers motivated, but the Days of Freedom also had an earthquake-like effect on the peasant collective as well.  Seeing an opening in the autocracy's waning authority thanks to the Manifesto, the peasants, with a political organization, took to the streets in revolt.  In response, the government exerted its forces in campaigns to subdue and repress both the peasants and the workers.  Consequences were now in full force: with a pretext in their hands, the government spent the month of December 1905 regaining the level of authority once lost to [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;Nader Sohrabi, ''Historicizing Revolutions'', pages 1409&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, the writers of the October Manifesto were caught off guard by the surge in revolts.  One of the main reasons for writing the October Manifesto bordered on the government's &quot;fear of the revolutionary movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;G.M. Kropotkin pages 23&quot;&gt;G. M. Kropotkin, The Ruling Bureaucracy and the &quot;New Order&quot; of Russian Statehood, pages 23&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many officials believed this fear was practically the sole reason for the Manifesto's creation in the first place.  Among those more scared was [[Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov]], governor general of [[St. Petersburg]] and deputy minister of the interior.  Trepov urged Nicholas II to stick to the principles in the Manifesto, for &quot;every retreat&amp;nbsp;... would be hazardous to the dynasty&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;G.M. Kropotkin pages 23&quot;/&gt;

===Russian Constitution of 1906===
The [[Russian Constitution of 1906]] was published on the eve of the convocation of the First Duma. The new Fundamental Law was enacted to institute promises of the October Manifesto as well as add new reforms. The Tsar was confirmed as absolute leader, with complete control of the executive, foreign policy, church, and the armed forces. The structure of the Duma was changed, becoming a lower chamber below the Council of Ministers, and was half-elected, half-appointed by the Tsar. Legislations had to be approved by the Duma, the Council, and the Tsar to become law. The Fundamental State Laws were the &quot;culmination of the whole sequence of events set in motion in October 1905 and which consolidated the new ''status quo''&quot;. The introduction of The Russian Constitution of 1906 was not simply an institution of the October Manifesto. The introduction of the constitution states (and thus emphasizes) the following:
* The Russian State is one and indivisible.
* The [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], while comprising an inseparable part of the Russian State, is governed in its internal affairs by special decrees based on special legislation.
* The Russian language is the common language of the state, and its use is compulsory in the army, the navy and all state and public institutions. The use of local (regional) languages and dialects in state and public institutions are determined by special legislation.

The Constitution did not mention any of the provisions of the October Manifesto. While it did enact the provisions laid out previously, its sole purpose seems again to be the propaganda for the monarchy and to simply not fall back on prior promises. The provisions and the new constitutional monarchy did not satisfy Russians and Lenin. The Constitution lasted until the fall of the empire in 1917.

== Rise of political violence ==
The years 1904 and 1907 saw a decline of mass movements, strikes and protests, and a rise of overt political violence. Combat groups such as the [[SR Combat Organization]] carried out many assassinations targeting civil servants and police, and robberies. Between 1906 and 1909, revolutionaries killed 7,293 people, of whom 2,640 were officials, and wounded 8,061.&lt;ref&gt;Galina Mikhaĭlovna Ivanova, Carol Apollonio Flath and Donald J. Raleigh, ''Labour camp socialism: the Gulag in the Soviet totalitarian system'' (2000), p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Notable victims included:
* [[Nikolai Bobrikov]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Governor-General of Finland]]. Killed {{OldStyleDate|30 June|1904|17 June}} in [[Helsinki]].
* [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]]&amp;nbsp;– Minister of Interior. Killed {{OldStyleDate|10 August|1904|28 July}} in [[Saint Petersburg]].

* [[Aleksey Ignatyev]]&amp;nbsp;– Killed {{OldStyleDate|22 December|1906|9 December}}.

== Repression ==
The years of revolution were marked by a dramatic rise in the numbers of death sentences and executions. Different figures on the number of executions were compared by Senator [[Nikolai Tagantsev]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.edu.ru/script/cntSource.asp?cntID=100066404 Article Death penalty in Russia.]&lt;/ref&gt; and are listed in the table.

== Ivanovo Soviet ==
[[Ivanovo|Ivanovo Voznesensk]] was known as the 'Russian Manchester' for its textile mills. In 1905, its local revolutionaries were overwhelmingly [[Bolshevik]]. It was the first Bolshevik branch in which workers outnumbered intellectuals.
* 11 May 1905: The 'Group', the revolutionary leadership, called for the workers at all the textile mills to strike.
* 12 May: The strike begins. Strike leaders meet in the local woods.
* 13 May: 40,000 workers assemble before the Administration Building to give Svirskii, the regional factory inspector, a list of demands.
* 14 May: Workers' delegates are elected. Svirskii had suggested they do so, as he wanted people to negotiate with.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Schwarz, ''The Russian Revolution of 1905,'' pages 135–7 335–8&lt;/ref&gt; A mass meeting is held in Administration Square. Svirskii tells them the mill owners will not meet their demands but will negotiate with elected mill delegates, who will be immune to prosecution, according to the governor.
* 15 May: Svirskii tells the strikers they can negotiate only about each factory in turn, but they can hold elections wherever. The strikers elect delegates to represent each mill while they are still out in the streets.  Later the delegates elect a chairman.
* 17 May: The meetings are moved to the bank of the [[Talka River]], on suggestion by the police chief.
* 27 May: The delegates' meeting house is closed.
* 3 June: [[Cossacks]] break up a workers' meeting, arresting over 20 men. Workers start sabotaging telephone wires and burn down a mill.
* 9 June: The police chief resigns.
* 12 June: All prisoners are released. Most mill owners flee to Moscow. Neither side gives in.
* 27 June: Workers agree to stop striking 1 July.

== Finland ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Finnish Civil War]] --&gt;
[[Image:Demonstration Pietarsaari 1905.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators in [[Jakobstad]]]]
In the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]] organised the [[general strike]] of 1905 ({{OldStyleDate|12–19 November||30 October&amp;nbsp;– 6 November}}). The [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] were formed, led by captain [[Johan Kock]]. During the general strike, the ''[[Red Declaration]]'', written by Finnish politician and journalist [[Yrjö Mäkelin]], was published in ''[[Tampere]],'' demanding dissolution of the [[Senate of Finland]], universal suffrage, [[Freedom (political)|political freedoms]], and abolition of censorship. [[Leo Mechelin]], leader of the constitutionalists, crafted the ''November Manifesto'': the revolution resulted in the abolition of the [[Diet of Finland]] and of the four [[Estates of the realm|Estates]], and to the creation of the modern [[Parliament of Finland]]. It also resulted in a temporary halt to the [[Russification of Finland|Russification policy]] that Russia had started in 1899.

On {{OldStyleDate|12 August|1906|30 July}}, Russian artillerymen and military engineers [[Sveaborg Rebellion|rose in revolt]] in the fortress of [[Sveaborg]] (later called [[Suomenlinna]]), Helsinki. The Finnish Red Guards supported the [[Sveaborg Rebellion]] with a general strike, but the mutiny was quelled within 60 hours by loyal troops and ships of the [[Baltic Fleet]].

== Estonia ==
&lt;!--[[File:Tallinn Monument to the Revolution of 1905.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Monument to the victims of the Revolution in Tallinn]]--&gt;
In the [[Governorate of Estonia]], Estonians called for [[freedom of the press]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], for universal suffrage, and for national autonomy. On {{OldStyleDate|29 October||16 October}}, the Russian army opened fire in a meeting on a street market in [[Tallinn]] in which about 8 000-10 000 people participated, killing 94 and injuring over 200. The October Manifesto was supported in Estonia and the [[Estonian flag]] was displayed publicly for the first time. [[Jaan Tõnisson]] used the new political freedoms to widen the rights of Estonians by establishing the first Estonian political party – ''National Progress Party''.

Another, more radical political organisation, the ''Estonian Social Democratic Workers' Union'' was founded as well. The moderate supporters of Tõnisson and the more radical supporters of [[Jaan Teemant]] could not agree about how to continue with the revolution, and only agreed that both wanted to limit the rights of [[Baltic Germans]] and to end Russification. The radical views were publicly welcomed and in December 1905, martial law was declared in Tallinn. A total of 160 manors were looted, resulting in ca. 400 workers and peasants being killed by the army. Estonian gains from the revolution were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.

== Latvia ==
[[File:Two Struggling Soldiers memorial in Riga (8228844765).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Bloody Sunday Monument in Riga on the [[Daugava]]]]
Following the shooting of demonstrators in St. Petersburg, a wide-scale general strike began in [[Riga]]. On {{OldStyleDate|26 January||13 January}}, Russian army troops opened fire on demonstrators killing 73 and injuring 200 people. During the middle of 1905, the focus of revolutionary events moved to the countryside with mass meetings and demonstrations. 470 new parish administrative bodies were elected in 94% of the parishes in Latvia. The Congress of Parish Representatives was held in Riga in November. In autumn 1905, armed conflict between the [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] nobility and the Latvian peasants began in the rural areas of [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]] and [[Governorate of Courland|Courland]]. In Courland, the peasants seized or surrounded several towns. In Livonia, the fighters controlled the Rūjiena-Pärnu railway line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Bleiere |first = Daina |author2 = Ilgvars Butulis |author3 = Antonijs Zunda |author4 = Aivars Stranga |author5 = Inesis Feldmanis |title = History of Latvia : the 20th century. |publisher = [[Jumava (publisher)|Jumava]] |location = [[Riga]] |page = 68 |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-9984-38-038-4 |oclc = 70240317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Martial law was declared in Courland in August 1905, and in Livonia in late November. Special punitive expeditions were dispatched in mid-December to suppress the movement. They executed 1170 people without trial or investigation and burned 300 peasant homes. Thousands were exiled to [[Siberia]]. Many Latvian intellectuals only escaped by fleeing to Western Europe or USA. In 1906, the revolutionary movement gradually subsided.

'''Jules Henri Poincaré''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|p|w|æ̃|k|ɑr|eɪ}}&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Poincaré}}&lt;/ref&gt; [US: stress final syllable], {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ʁi pwɛ̃kaʁe|lang|Fr-Henri Poincaré.ogg}};&lt;ref name=&quot;forvo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forvo.com/word/poincar%C3%A9/ |title=Poincaré pronunciation: How to pronounce Poincaré in French |website=forvo.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pronouncekiwi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pronouncekiwi.com/Henri%20Poincaré |title=How To Pronounce Henri Poincaré |website=pronouncekiwi.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 29 April 1854&amp;nbsp;– 17 July 1912) was a French [[mathematician]], [[theoretical physicist]], [[engineer]], and [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]]. He is often described as a [[polymath]], and in mathematics as &quot;The Last Universalist&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=J. M. | last1=Ginoux | first2=C. | last2=Gerini | title=Henri Poincaré: A Biography Through the Daily Papers | publisher=World Scientific | date=2013 | isbn=978-981-4556-61-3 | doi=10.1142/8956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime.

As a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions to [[Pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[celestial mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hadamard, Jacques|authorlink=Jacques Hadamard|title=The early scientific work of Henri Poincaré|journal=The Rice Institute Pamphlet|date=July 1922|volume=9|issue=3|pages=111–183|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100592035}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his research on the [[three-body problem]], Poincaré became the first person to discover a chaotic [[deterministic system]] which laid the foundations of modern [[chaos theory]]. He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of [[topology]].

Poincaré made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the [[Lorentz transformations]] in their modern symmetrical form. Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to [[Hendrik Lorentz]] in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of [[Maxwell's equations]], an important step in the formulation of the theory of [[special relativity]]. In 1905, Poincaré first proposed [[gravitational wave]]s (''ondes gravifiques'') emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations.

The [[Poincaré group]] used in physics and mathematics was named after him.

Early in the 20th century he formulated the [[Poincaré conjecture]] that became over time one of the famous [[unsolved problems in mathematics]] until it was solved in 2002–2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]].

==Life==
Poincaré was born on 29 April 1854 in Cité Ducale neighborhood, [[Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle]], into an influential French family.&lt;ref&gt;Belliver, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; His father Léon Poincaré (1828–1892) was a professor of medicine at the [[University of Nancy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sagaret, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; His younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher [[Émile Boutroux]]. Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, [[Raymond Poincaré]], a fellow member of the [[Académie française]], who would serve as President of France from 1913 to 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEP&quot;&gt;[http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/p/poincare.htm The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Jules Henri Poincaré article by Mauro Murzi&amp;nbsp;– Retrieved November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
[[File:Henri Poincaré maison natale Nancy plaque.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Plaque on the birthplace of Henri Poincaré at house number 117 on the Grande Rue in the city of Nancy]]

During his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with [[diphtheria]] and received special instruction from his mother, Eugénie Launois (1830–1897).

In 1862, Henri entered the Lycée in [[Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Nancy]] (now renamed the {{ill|Lycée Henri-Poincaré|fr}} in his honour, along with [[Henri Poincaré University]], also in Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lycée and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a &quot;monster of mathematics&quot; and he won first prizes in the [[concours général]], a competition between the top pupils from all the Lycées across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as &quot;average at best&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Carl, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the Lycée in 1871 with a bachelor's degree in letters and sciences.

During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, he served alongside his father in the Ambulance Corps.

Poincaré entered the [[École Polytechnique]] as the top qualifier in 1873 and graduated in 1875. There he studied mathematics as a student of [[Charles Hermite]], continuing to excel and publishing his first paper (''Démonstration nouvelle des propriétés de l'indicatrice d'une surface'') in 1874. From November 1875 to June 1878 he studied at the [[École des Mines]], while continuing the study of mathematics in addition to the mining engineering syllabus, and received the degree of ordinary mining engineer in March 1879.&lt;ref&gt;F. Verhulst&lt;/ref&gt;

As a graduate of the École des Mines, he joined the [[Corps des Mines]] as an inspector for the [[Vesoul]] region in northeast France. He was on the scene of a mining disaster at [[Magny-lès-Jussey|Magny]] in August 1879 in which 18 miners died. He carried out the official investigation into the accident in a characteristically thorough and humane way.

At the same time, Poincaré was preparing for his [[Doctorate in Science]] in mathematics under the supervision of Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis was in the field of [[differential equations]]. It was named ''Sur les propriétés des fonctions définies par les équations aux différences partielles''. Poincaré devised a new way of studying the properties of these equations. He not only faced the question of determining the integral of such equations, but also was the first person to study their general geometric properties. He realised that they could be used to model the behaviour of multiple bodies in free motion within the [[solar system]]. Poincaré graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1879.

===First scientific achievements===
After receiving his degree, Poincaré began teaching as junior lecturer in mathematics at the [[Caen University|University of Caen]] in Normandy (in December 1879). At the same time he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of [[automorphic function]]s.

There, in [[Caen]], he met his future wife, Louise Poulain d'Andecy and on 20 April 1881, they married. Together they had four children: Jeanne (born 1887), Yvonne (born 1889), Henriette (born 1891), and Léon (born 1893).

Poincaré immediately established himself among the greatest mathematicians of Europe, attracting the attention of many prominent mathematicians. In 1881 Poincaré was invited to take a teaching position at the Faculty of Sciences of the [[University of Paris]]; he accepted the invitation. During the years of 1883 to 1897, he taught mathematical analysis in [[École Polytechnique]].

In 1881–1882, Poincaré created a new branch of mathematics: [[qualitative theory of differential equations]]. He showed how it is possible to derive the most important information about the behavior of a family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in [[celestial mechanics]] and [[mathematical physics]].

===Career===
He never fully abandoned his mining career to mathematics. He worked at the [[Ministry of Public Services]] as an engineer in charge of northern railway development from 1881 to 1885. He eventually became chief engineer of the Corps de Mines in 1893 and inspector general in 1910.

Beginning in 1881 and for the rest of his career, he taught at the University of Paris (the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]). He was initially appointed as the ''maître de conférences d'analyse'' (associate professor of analysis).&lt;ref&gt;Sageret, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he held the chairs of Physical and Experimental Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Theory of Probability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Laurent|last= Mazliak|chapter= Poincaré’s Odds |title = Poincaré 1912-2012 : Poincaré Seminar 2012|editor1-first= B.|editor1-last= Duplantier |editor2-first= V.|editor2-last= Rivasseau|volume = 67 |series = Progress in Mathematical Physics|publisher = Springer|isbn = 9783034808347|location = Basel|page = 150|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=njNpBQAAQBAJ|date= 14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Celestial Mechanics and Astronomy.

In 1887, at the young age of 32, Poincaré was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He became its president in 1906, and was elected to the [[Académie française]] on 5 March 1908.

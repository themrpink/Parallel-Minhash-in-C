==Origins==
[[File:Smoky Mtn View.jpg|thumb|500px|[[Great Smoky Mountains]]]]
Anthropologists and historians have two main theories of Cherokee origins. One is that the Cherokee, an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking people, are relative latecomers to Southern [[Appalachia]], who may have migrated in late prehistoric times from northern areas around the Great Lakes, the traditional territory of the  ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' nations and other Iroquoian-speaking peoples. Another theory is that the Cherokee had been in the Southeast for thousands of years and that proto-Iroquoian developed here.

James Mooney in the late 19th century recorded conversations with elders who recounted an oral tradition of the Cherokee people migrating south from the [[Great Lakes]] region in ancient times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mooney 1900 393&quot;/&gt; They may have moved south and settled or coalesced at the sites of [[mound]]s built by the peoples of the earlier Woodland and [[Mississippian culture]] periods. 

The people of the Connestee culture period are believed to be ancestors of the historic Cherokee, and occupied what is now western North Carolina in the Middle Woodland period, circa 200 to 600 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/08/21/answer-man-did-cherokee-live-biltmore-estate-lands-early-settlers/581792001/|title=Answer Man: Did the Cherokee live on Biltmore Estate lands? Early settlers?|last=Boyle|first=John|work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]|date=August 21, 2017|access-date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Need additional sources - a local newspaper is not the place for establishing such technical data based on archeological evidence. --&gt;

Other ancestors of the Cherokee are considered to be part of the later [[Pisgah Phase]] of Southern Appalachia, which lasted from circa 1000 to 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant and Fogelson, 132&lt;/ref&gt; There is a consensus among most specialists in Southeast archeology and anthropology about these dates. But Finger says that ancestors of the Cherokee people lived in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee for a far longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Finger, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the late [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] and [[Woodland Period]], Native Americans in the region began to cultivate plants such as [[Iva annua|marsh elder]], [[Chenopodium berlandieri|lambsquarters]], [[Amaranthus palmeri|pigweed]], [[Helianthus annuus|sunflowers]], and some native [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. People created new art forms such as [[shell gorget]]s, adopted new technologies, and developed an elaborate cycle of religious ceremonies.

During the Mississippian culture-period (800 to 1500 CE), local women developed a new variety of maize (corn) called eastern [[flint corn]]. It closely resembled modern corn and produced larger crops. The successful cultivation of corn surpluses allowed the rise of larger, more complex chiefdoms consisting of several villages and concentrated populations during this period. Corn became celebrated among numerous peoples in religious ceremonies, especially the [[Green Corn Ceremony]].

In the 19th century, European-American settlers mistakenly attributed several prehistoric Mississippian culture period sites in Georgia to the Cherokee, including [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]] mounds. However, other evidence{{Clarify|date=February 2019}} shows that the Cherokee did not reach this part of Georgia until the late 18th century and could not have built these mounds. But they also considered them sacred and preserved them.

==Early culture==
Much of what is known about pre-18th-century Native American cultures has come from records of Spanish expeditions. The earliest ones of the mid-16th-century encountered peoples of the [[Mississippian culture]] era, who were ancestral to tribes that emerged in the Southeast, such as the Cherokee, [[Muscogee]], [[Cheraw]], and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]]. Specifically in 1540-41, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through present-day South Carolina, proceeding into western North Carolina and what is considered Cherokee country. The Spanish recorded a ''Chalaque'' people as living around the [[Keowee River]], where western North Carolina, South Carolina, and northeastern Georgia meet. The Cherokee consider this area to be part of their homelands, which also extended into southeastern Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further west, De Soto's expedition visited villages in present-day northwestern Georgia, recording them as ruled at the time by the [[Coosa chiefdom]]. This is believed to be a chiefdom ancestral to the [[Muscogee Creek people]], who developed as a Muskogean-speaking people with a distinct  culture.&lt;ref name=NGE&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-573 &quot;Late Prehistoric/Early Historic Chiefdoms (ca. A.D. 1300-1850)&quot;]. ''New Georgia Encyclopedia''. Retrieved July 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1566, the [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] expedition traveled from the present-day South Carolina coast into its interior, and into North Carolina and southeastern Tennessee. He recorded meeting Cherokee-speaking peoples while staying at the [[Joara]] chiefdom (north of present-day [[Morganton, North Carolina]]. He wintered over at Joara, building Fort San Juan there in 1567. His expedition proceeded into the interior, noting villages near modern [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] and other places that are part of the Cherokee homelands. According to anthropologist [[Charles M. Hudson]], the Pardo expedition recorded encounters with [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean]]-speaking peoples at [[Chiaha]] in southeastern modern Tennessee. 

English-speaking historians had a limited understanding of early historic Native American cultures in the Southeast because such Spanish accounts became overlooked and were not translated into English until the 20th century. In addition, because English colonists predominated in the Southeast and competed with the Spanish, they discounted Spanish sources for some time in their construction of history of the area.

Linguistic studies have been another way for researchers to study the development of people and their cultures. Unlike most other Native American tribes in the American Southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee and [[Tuscarora people]] spoke [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian languages]]. Since the [[Great Lakes]] region was the territory of most Iroquoian-language speakers, scholars have theorized that both the Cherokee and Tuscarora migrated south from that region. The Cherokee [[oral history]] tradition supports their migration from the Great Lakes. 

Linguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting they had migrated long ago. Scholars posit a split between the groups in the distant past, perhaps 3500–3800 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;mooney&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mooney | first = James | authorlink = James Mooney | title = Myths of the Cherokee | origyear = 1900 | year = 1995 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | isbn = 0-486-28907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glottochronology]] studies suggest the split occurred between about 1,500 and 1,800 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Glottochronology from: Lounsbury, Floyd (1961), and Mithun, Marianne (1981), cited in [http://www.famsi.org/research/hopkins/SouthEastUSLanguages.pdf Nicholas A. Hopkins, ''The Native Languages of the Southeastern United States''].&lt;/ref&gt; The Cherokee say that the ancient settlement of ''[[Kituwa]]'' on the [[Tuckasegee River]] as their original settlement in the Southeast. It was formerly adjacent to and is now part of [[Qualla Boundary]] (the base of the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]]) in North Carolina.&lt;ref name=&quot;mooney&quot;/&gt;

According to Thomas Whyte, who posits that proto-Iroguoian developed in Appalachia, the Cherokee and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] broke off in the Southeast from the major group of Iroquoian speakers who migrated north to the Great Lakes area. There a succession of Iroquoian-speaking tribes were encountered by Europeans in historic times. 

===Other sources of early Cherokee history===
In the 1830s, the American writer [[John Howard Payne]] visited the Cherokee then based in Georgia, and recounted what they shared about pre-19th-century Cherokee culture and society. For instance, the Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional two-part societal structure. A &quot;white&quot; organization of elders represented the seven [[clans]]. As Payne recounted, this group, which was [[hereditary]] and priestly, was responsible for religious activities, such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the &quot;red&quot; organization, was responsible for warfare. The Cherokee considered warfare a polluting activity. After warfare, the warriors required purification by the priestly class before participants could reintegrate into normal village life. This hierarchy had disappeared long before the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Researchers have debated the reasons for the change. Some historians believe the decline in priestly power originated with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the ''[[Ani-kutani]]''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Irwina-1992&quot;&gt;Irwin 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnography|Ethnographer]] [[James Mooney]], who studied and talked with the Cherokee in the late 1880s, was the first to trace the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that Mooney was studying the people in the late 1880s, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irwina-1992&quot;/&gt;

Another major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the ''didanvwisgi'' ({{lang|chr|ᏗᏓᏅᏫᏍᎩ}}), Cherokee [[medicine man|medicine men]], after [[Sequoyah]]'s creation of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] in the 1820s. Initially only the ''didanvwisgi'' learned to write and read such materials, which were considered extremely powerful in a spiritual sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irwina-1992&quot;/&gt; Later, the syllabary and writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people.

==History==
{{Main|Cherokee history}}

===17th century: English contact===
In 1657, there was a disturbance in [[Virginia Colony]] as the ''Rechahecrians'' or ''Rickahockans'', as well as the Siouan ''[[Manahoac]]'' and ''[[Nahyssan]]'', broke through the frontier and settled near the Falls of the James River, near present-day [[Richmond, Virginia]].  The following year, a combined force of English and [[Pamunkey]] drove the newcomers away.  The identity of the ''Rechahecrians'' has been much debated.  Historians noted the name closely resembled that recorded for the ''Eriechronon'' or ''Erielhonan'', commonly known as the [[Erie tribe]], another Iroquoian-speaking people based south of the Great Lakes in present-day northern Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/2016/1/21/316430/Lost-Nation-of-the-Erie-Part-1.aspx|title=Lost Nation of the Erie Part 1|website=www.chattanoogan.com|date=January 21, 2016|first=Chuck|last=Hamilton|access-date=April 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123232302/http://www.chattanoogan.com/2016/1/21/316430/Lost-Nation-of-the-Erie-Part-1.aspx|archive-date=January 23, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This Iroquoian people had been driven away from the southern shore of [[Lake Erie]] in 1654 by the powerful [[Iroquois]] Five Nations, who were seeking more hunting grounds to support their dominance in the beaver fur trade.  The [[anthropologist]] Martin Smith theorized some remnants of the tribe migrated to Virginia after the wars ([[#refSmith1987|1986:131–32]]), later becoming known as the [[Westo]] to English in the Carolina colony. A few historians suggest this tribe was Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;Conley, ''A Cherokee Encyclopedia'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginian traders developed a small-scale trading system with the Cherokee in the Piedmont before the end of the 17th century; the earliest recorded Virginia trader to live among the Cherokee was Cornelius Dougherty or Dority, in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, ''Myths of the Cherokee'' p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Preston Summers, 1903, ''History of Southwest Virginia, 1746–1786'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Cherokee military history}}
The Cherokee gave sanctuary to a band of [[Shawnee]] in the 1660s. But from 1710 to 1715 the Cherokee and [[Chickasaw]] allied with the British, and fought the Shawnee, who were allied with French colonists, forcing the Shawnee to move northward.&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Rozema, ''Footsteps of the Cherokees'' (1995), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cherokee fought with the [[Yamasee]], [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]], and British in late 1712 and early 1713 against the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] in the Second [[Tuscarora War]]. The Tuscarora War marked the beginning of a British-Cherokee relationship that, despite breaking down on occasion, remained strong for much of the 18th century. With the growth of the [[deerskin trade]], the Cherokee were considered valuable trading partners, since deer skins from the cooler country of their mountain hunting-grounds were of a better quality than those supplied by the lowland coastal tribes, who were neighbors of the English colonists.

In January 1716, Cherokee murdered a delegation of [[Muscogee Creek]] leaders at the town of [[Tugaloo (Cherokee town)|Tugaloo]], marking their entry into the [[Yamasee War]].  It ended in 1717 with peace treaties between the colony of [[South Carolina]] and the Creek.  Hostility and sporadic raids between the Cherokee and Creek continued for decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;oatis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Oatis |first=Steven J. |title=A Colonial Complex: South Carolina's Frontiers in the Era of the Yamasee War, 1680–1730 |location=Lincoln |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8032-3575-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These raids came to a head at the [[Battle of Taliwa]] in 1755, present-day [[Ball Ground, Georgia]], with the defeat of the Muscogee.

In 1721, the Cherokee ceded lands in South Carolina. In 1730, at [[Nikwasi]], a former Mississippian culture site, a Scots adventurer, Sir [[Alexander Cuming]], crowned [[Moytoy of Tellico]] as &quot;Emperor&quot; of the Cherokee.  Moytoy agreed to recognize King [[George II of Great Britain]] as the Cherokee protector.  Cuming arranged to take seven prominent Cherokee, including ''[[Attakullakulla]]'',  to [[London]], England.  There the Cherokee delegation signed the [[Cherokee treaties|Treaty of Whitehall]] with the British.  Moytoy's son, [[Amouskositte|Amo-sgasite]] (Dreadful Water), attempted to succeed him as &quot;Emperor&quot; in 1741, but the Cherokee elected their own leader, [[Conocotocko I|Conocotocko]] (Old Hop) of [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]].&lt;ref name=ecc&gt;Brown, John P.

Political power among the Cherokee remained decentralized, and towns acted autonomously.  In 1735 the Cherokee were estimated to have sixty-four towns and villages, and 6,000 fighting men.  In 1738 and 1739 [[smallpox]] epidemics broke out among the Cherokee, who had no natural immunity to the new infectious disease.  Nearly half their population died within a year.  Hundreds of other Cherokee committed [[suicide]] due to their losses and disfigurement from the disease.
[[File:Three Cherokee.jpg|thumb|250px|right|After the [[Anglo-Cherokee War]], bitterness remained between the two groups. In 1765, [[Henry Timberlake]] took three of the former Cherokee adversaries to London to help cement the newly declared friendship.]]

American colonist [[Henry Timberlake]] described the Cherokee people as he saw them in 1761:

{{quote|The Cherokees are of a middle stature, of an olive colour, tho' generally painted, and their skins stained with gun-powder, pricked into it in very pretty figures. The hair of their head is shaved, tho' many of the old people have it plucked out by the roots, except a patch on the hinder part of the head, about twice the bigness of a crown-piece, which is ornamented with beads, feathers, [[wampum]], stained deers hair, and such like baubles. The ears are slit and stretched to an enormous size, putting the person who undergoes the operation to incredible pain, being unable to lie on either side for nearly forty days. To remedy this, they generally slit but one at a time; so soon as the patient can bear it, they wound round with wire to expand them, and are adorned with silver pendants and rings, which they likewise wear at the nose. This custom does not belong originally to the Cherokees, but taken by them from the Shawnese, or other northern nations.

They that can afford it wear a collar of wampum, which are beads cut out of clam-shells, a silver breast-plate, and bracelets on their arms and wrists of the same metal, a bit of cloth over their private parts, a shirt of the English make, a sort of cloth-boots, and [[moccasins|mockasons]] ([[sic]]), which are shoes of a make peculiar to the Americans, ornamented with porcupine-quills; a large mantle or match-coat thrown over all complete their dress at home ...&lt;ref name=Timberlake&gt;{{cite web|last=Timberlake|first=Henry|title=Memoirs of Henry Timberlake|publisher=London 1765, pp. 49-51}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1753 to 1755, battles broke out between the Cherokee and Muscogee over disputed hunting grounds in [[North Georgia]]. The Cherokee were victorious in the [[Battle of Taliwa]].  British soldiers built forts in Cherokee country to defend against the French in the [[Seven Years' War]], which was fought across Europe and was called the [[French and Indian War]] on the North American front. These included [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudoun]] near Chota.  In 1756 the Cherokee were allies of the British in the French and Indian War.  Serious misunderstandings arose quickly between the two allies, resulting in the 1760 [[Anglo-Cherokee War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rozema, pp. 17–23&quot;&gt;Rozema, pp. 17–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

King George III's [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] forbade British settlements west of the Appalachian crest, as his government tried to afford some protection from colonial encroachment to the Cherokee and other tribes.  The Crown found the ruling difficult to enforce with colonists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rozema, pp. 17–23&quot;/&gt;

In 1771–1772, North Carolinian settlers squatted on Cherokee lands in Tennessee, forming the [[Watauga Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/98/entry &quot;Watauga Association&quot;], ''North Carolina History Project.'' . Retrieved September 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Boone]] and his party tried to settle in Kentucky, but the Shawnee, [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Mingo]], and some Cherokee attacked a scouting and forage party that included Boone's son.  The American Indians used this territory as a hunting ground by right of conquest; it had hardly been inhabited for years.  The conflict in Kentucky sparked the beginning of what was known as [[Dunmore's War]] (1773–1774).

In 1776, allied with the Shawnee led by [[Cornstalk]], Cherokee attacked settlers in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina in the [[Cherokee–American wars#The Second Cherokee War|Second Cherokee War]]. [[Overhill Cherokee]] [[Nancy Ward]], [[Dragging Canoe]]'s cousin, warned settlers of impending attacks. Provincial militias retaliated, destroying more than 50 Cherokee towns. North Carolina militia in 1776 and 1780 invaded and destroyed the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill towns]]. In 1777, surviving Cherokee town leaders signed treaties with the new states.

[[Dragging Canoe]] and his band settled along [[Chickamauga Creek]] near present-day [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where they established 11 new towns. [[Chickamauga Town]] was his headquarters and the colonists tended to call his entire band the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chickamauga]] to distinguish them from other Cherokee. From here he fought a [[Cherokee–American wars|guerrilla war]] against settlers, which lasted from 1776 to 1794. These are known informally as the Cherokee–American wars, but this is not an historians' term.  The first Treaty of [[Tellico Blockhouse]], signed November 7, 1794, finally brought peace between the Cherokee and Americans, who had achieved independence from the British Crown. In 1805, the Cherokee ceded their lands between the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck rivers]] (i.e. the [[Cumberland Plateau]]) to [[Tennessee]].

====Scots (and other Europeans) among the Cherokee in the 18th century====
The traders and British government agents dealing with the southern tribes in general, and the Cherokee in particular, were nearly all of Scottish ancestry, with many documented as being from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. A few were Scots-Irish, English, French, and German (see [[Scottish Indian trade]]).  Many of these men married women from their host peoples and remained after the fighting had ended. Some had mixed-race children who would later become significant leaders among the Five Civilized Tribes of the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]].&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, James. ''History, Myths, and Scared Formulas of the Cherokee'', p. 83. (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1900).&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable traders, agents, and refugee Tories among the Cherokee included [[John Stuart (loyalist)|John Stuart]], Henry Stuart, Alexander Cameron, John McDonald, John Joseph Vann (father of [[James Vann]]), Daniel Ross (father of [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]]), John Walker Sr., John McLemore (father of Bob), William Buchanan, John Watts (father of [[John Watts (Cherokee chief)|John Watts Jr.]]), [[Chisholm Tavern (Knoxville)|John D. Chisholm]], John Benge (father of [[Bob Benge]]), Thomas Brown, [[John Rogers (Cherokee chief)|John Rogers]] (Welsh), John Gunter (German, founder of Gunter's Landing), [[James Adair (historian)|James Adair]] (Irish), William Thorpe (English), and Peter Hildebrand (German), among many others. Some attained the honorary status of minor chiefs and/or members of significant delegations.

By contrast, a large portion of the settlers encroaching on the Native American territories were [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], Irish from [[Ulster]] who were of Scottish descent and had been part of the English plantation of northern Ireland. They also tended to support the Revolution. But in the back country, there were also Scots-Irish who were Loyalists, such as [[Simon Girty]].

===19th century===
====Acculturation====
The Cherokee lands between the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] rivers were remote enough from white settlers to remain independent after the [[Cherokee–American wars]].  The [[deerskin trade]] was no longer feasible on their greatly reduced lands, and over the next several decades, the people of the fledgling [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] began to build a new society modeled on the white Southern United States.
[[File:Major ridge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Major Ridge in 1834, from ''[[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]]''.]]

[[George Washington]] sought to 'civilize' Southeastern American Indians, through programs overseen by the [[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]].  He encouraged the Cherokee to abandon their communal land-tenure and settle on individual farmsteads, which was facilitated by the destruction of many American Indian towns during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The [[deerskin trade]] brought [[white-tailed deer]] to the brink of extinction, and as pigs and cattle were introduced, they became the principal sources of meat.  The government supplied the tribes with [[spinning wheel]]s and cotton-seed, and men were taught to fence and plow the land, in contrast to their traditional division in which crop cultivation was woman's labor.  Americans instructed the women in weaving.  Eventually Hawkins helped them set up smithys, gristmills and cotton plantations.

The Cherokee organized a national government under Principal Chiefs [[Little Turkey]] (1788–1801), [[Black Fox (Cherokee chief)|Black Fox]] (1801–1811), and [[Pathkiller]] (1811–1827), all former warriors of [[Dragging Canoe]].  The 'Cherokee triumvirate' of [[James Vann]] and his protégés [[Major Ridge|The Ridge]] and [[Charles R. Hicks]] advocated acculturation, formal education, and modern methods of farming.  In 1801 they invited [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries from [[North Carolina]] to teach Christianity and the 'arts of civilized life.'  The Moravians and later [[Congregationalist]] missionaries ran boarding schools, and a select few students were educated at the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] school in [[Connecticut]].

In 1806 a [[Federal Road (Cherokee lands)|Federal Road]] from [[Savannah, Georgia]] to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] was built through Cherokee land. Chief [[James Vann]] opened a tavern, inn and ferry across the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] and built a [[Chief Vann House Historic Site|cotton-plantation]] on a spur of the road from [[Athens, Georgia]] to [[Nashville]].  His son [[Joseph Vann|'Rich Joe' Vann]] developed the plantation to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}, cultivated by 150 slaves.  He exported cotton to England, and owned a [[steamboat]] on the [[Tennessee River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2726&amp;hl=y |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Chief Vann House |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=September 23, 2005 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cherokee allied with the U.S. against the nativist and pro-British [[Red Stick]] faction of the Upper Creek in the [[Creek War]] during the [[War of 1812]]. Cherokee warriors led by [[Major Ridge]] played a major role in General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. Major Ridge moved his family to [[Rome, Georgia]], where he built a [[Chieftains (Rome, Georgia)|substantial house]], developed a large plantation and ran a ferry on the [[Oostanaula River]].  Although he never learned English, he sent his son and nephews to New England to be educated in mission schools. His interpreter and protégé Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], the descendant of several generations of Cherokee women and Scots fur-traders, built a plantation and operated a trading firm and a ferry at Ross' Landing ([[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]). During this period, divisions arose between the acculturated elite and the great majority of Cherokee, who clung to traditional ways of life.

Around 1809 [[Sequoyah]] began developing a written form of the Cherokee language. He spoke no English, but his experiences as a silversmith dealing regularly with white settlers, and as a warrior at Horseshoe Bend, convinced him the Cherokee needed to develop writing. In 1821, he introduced [[Cherokee syllabary]], the first written syllabic form of an American Indian language outside of [[Mesoamerican scripts|Central America]].  Initially his innovation was opposed by both Cherokee traditionalists and white missionaries, who sought to encourage the use of English. When Sequoyah taught children to read and write with the syllabary, he reached the adults. By the 1820s, the Cherokee had a higher rate of literacy than the whites around them in Georgia.

In 1819, the Cherokee began holding council meetings at New Town, at the headwaters of the [[Oostanaula River|Oostanaula]] (near present-day [[Calhoun, Georgia]]). In November 1825, New Town became the capital of the Cherokee Nation, and was renamed [[New Echota]], after the [[Overhill Cherokee]] principal town of [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/ang/New_Echota_Historic_Site |title=New Echota Historic Site |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequoyah's syllabary was adopted. They had developed a police force, a judicial system, and a National Committee.

In 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a Constitution modeled on the United States, with executive, legislative and judicial branches and a system of checks and balances. The two-tiered legislature was led by Major Ridge and his son [[John Ridge]]. Convinced the tribe's survival required English-speaking leaders who could negotiate with the U.S., the legislature appointed [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] as Principal Chief. A printing press was established at New Echota by the [[Vermont]] missionary [[Samuel Worcester]] and Major Ridge's nephew [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], who had taken the name of his [[Elias Boudinot|white benefactor]], a leader of the [[Continental Congress]] and [[New Jersey]] Congressman. They translated the Bible into [[Cherokee syllabary]].  Boudinot published the first edition of the bilingual '[[Cherokee Phoenix]],' the first American Indian newspaper, in February 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-611&amp;hl=y |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Cherokee Phoenix |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=August 28, 2002 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the final removal to present-day Oklahoma, many Cherokees relocated to present-day [[Arkansas]], [[Missouri]] and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Rollings (1992) pp. 187, 230–255.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1775 and 1786 the Cherokee, along with people of other nations such as the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]], began voluntarily settling along the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and [[Red River of the South|Red River]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rollings (1992) pp. 187, 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802, the federal government promised to extinguish Indian titles to lands claimed by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in return for Georgia's cession of the western lands that became [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]]. To convince the Cherokee to move voluntarily in 1815, the US government established a Cherokee Reservation in Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Charles Russell.

Retrieved September 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The reservation boundaries extended from north of the [[Arkansas River]] to the southern bank of the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]]. [[The Bowl (Cherokee chief)|Di'wali]] (The Bowl), [[Sequoyah]], Spring Frog and Tatsi (Dutch) and their bands settled there. These Cherokees became known as &quot;Old Settlers.&quot;

The Cherokee, eventually, migrated as far north as the [[Missouri Bootheel]] by 1816.  They lived interspersed among the [[Delaware Nation|Delawares]] and [[Shawnee]]s of that area.&lt;ref&gt;Doublass (1912) pp. 40–2&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cherokee in [[Missouri Territory]] increased rapidly in population, from 1,000 to 6,000 over the next year (1816–1817), according to reports by Governor [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;Rollings (1992) p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased conflicts with the [[Osage Nation]] led to the [[Battle of Claremore Mound]] and the eventual establishment of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] between Cherokee and Osage communities.&lt;ref&gt;Rollings (1992) pp. 239–40.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Treaty of St. Louis (1825)]], the Osage were made to &quot;cede and relinquish to the United States, all their right, title, interest, and claim, to lands lying within the State of Missouri and Territory of Arkansas{{nbsp}}...&quot; to make room for the Cherokee and the ''Mashcoux'', [[Muscogee Creek]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rollings (1992) pp. 254–5, Doublass (1912) p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the winter of 1838, Cherokee and Creek living in the Missouri and Arkansas areas petitioned the War Department to remove the Osage from the area.&lt;ref&gt;Rollings (1992) pp. 280–1&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Cherokee traditionalists led by [[The Bowl (Cherokee chief)|''Di'wali'']] moved to [[Spanish Texas]] in 1819. Settling near [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]], they were welcomed by Mexican authorities as potential allies against Anglo-American colonists. The [[Texas Cherokees]] were mostly neutral during the [[Texas War of Independence]].  In 1836, they signed a treaty with Texas President [[Sam Houston]], an adopted member of the Cherokee tribe. His successor [[Mirabeau Lamar]] sent militia to evict them in 1839.

==Early life==

=== Family ===
Rosenberg was born on 12 January 1893 in [[Reval]], now [[Tallinn]] (the capital of modern [[Estonia]]), then in the [[Governorate of Estonia]] ([[Russian Empire]]). His mother Elfriede (née Siré), who had [[French people|French]] and German ancestry, was the daughter of Louise Rosalie (née Fabricius), born near [[Lihula|Leal]] (modern [[Lihula]], Estonia) in 1842, and of the railway official Friedrich August Siré, born in [[Saint Petersburg|Saint-Petersburg]] (Russian Empire) in 1843.{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|p=6}}{{Sfn|Hiio|2018|p=}} Born in the same city in 1868 and confirmed in Reval at 17 in 1885, Elfriede Siré married Woldemar Wilhelm Rosenberg, a wealthy merchant from Reval, in the [[Lutheran Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul]] (St-Petersburg) in 1886.{{Sfn|Hiio|2018|p=}} His paternal grandfather, Martin Rosenberg, was a master shoemaker and elder of his [[guild]]. Born in [[Riga]] in 1820, and probably partly of [[Latvians|Latvian]] descent, he had moved to Reval in the 1850s where he met Julie Elisabeth Stramm, born in [[Juuru|Jörden]] (Estonia) in 1835. The two married in the German St. Nicholas parish of Reval in 1856.{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|p=6}}{{Sfn|Hiio|2018|p=}} Several deaths occurred in Rosenberg's family when he was a young child. His mother died only two months after his birth, at 24 in 1893, his paternal grandfather died in 1896, and his father died at 42 in 1904 after a long illness.{{Sfn|Piper|2015|p=21}}{{Sfn|Hiio|2018|p=}}

The [[Hungarian-Jewish]] journalist Franz Szell, who was apparently residing in [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]], [[Prussia]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], spent a year researching in [[Latvia]]n and [[Estonia]]n archives before publishing an open letter in 1936, with copies to [[Hermann Göring]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], Foreign Minister [[Konstantin von Neurath]] and others, accusing Rosenberg of having &quot;no drop of German blood&quot; flowing in his veins. Szell wrote that among Rosenberg's ancestors were only &quot;Latvians, Jews, Mongols, and French.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Staff (March 2008) [http://www.aim25.com/cats/104/8539.htm &quot;Szell, Franz (fl 1936-1937): correspondence regarding Alfred Rosenberg&quot; (catalog entry)] Wiener Library Quote: &quot;Franz Szell, an exiled Hungarian journalist apparently resident in Tilsit, Lithuania spent more than a year in the archives in Latvia and Estonia researching Alfred Rosenberg's family history with a view to publishing the open letter, 936/1.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his open letter, Szell was deported by Lithuanian authorities on 15 September 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (5 September 1936) [http://www.jta.org/1936/09/16/archive/lithuania-deports-writer-who-called-nazi-chief-non-aryan &quot;Lithuania Deports Writer Who Called Nazi Chief 'non-aryan'&quot;] ''[[Jewish Telegraph Agency]]''&lt;/ref&gt; His claims were repeated in the 15 September 1937 issue of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gugenberger, Edouard (2002) ''Boten der Apokalypse.

=== Education and early career ===
The young Rosenberg graduated from the Petri-Realschule (currently Tallinna Reaalkool) and went on to study architecture at the [[Riga Polytechnical Institute]] and engineering at [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University|Moscow's Highest Technical School]]&lt;ref name=&quot;zeno&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeno.org/Geschichte/M/Der+N%C3%BCrnberger+Proze%C3%9F/Hauptverhandlungen/Einhundertachter+Tag.+Montag,+15.+April+1946/Nachmittagssitzung |title=Der Nürnberger Prozeß, Hauptverhandlungen, Einhundertachter Tag.

During his stays at home in Reval, he attended the art studio of the famed painter [[Ants Laikmaa]], but even though he showed promise, there are no records that he ever exhibited.

During the [[German occupation of Estonia during World War I|German occupation]] in 1918, Rosenberg served as a teacher at the [[Gustav Adolf Gymnasium]]. He gave his first speech on [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Marxism]] on 30 November, at the [[House of the Blackheads (Tallinn)|House of the Blackheads]], after the outbreak of the [[Estonian War of Independence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapo&quot;&gt;Pekka Erelt [http://ekspress.delfi.ee/kuum/kapo-luuras-natsijuhi-alfred-rosenbergi-jarele?id=64991850 Kapo luuras natsijuhi Alfred Rosenbergi järele] [[Eesti Ekspress]]&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to Germany with the retreating imperial army, along with [[Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter|Max Scheubner-Richter]], who served as something of a mentor to Rosenberg and to his ideology. Arriving in [[Munich]], he contributed to [[Dietrich Eckart]]'s publication, the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' (''Ethnic/Nationalist Observer''). By this time, he was both an [[antisemite]] – influenced by [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]]'s book ''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]'', one of the key proto-Nazi books of [[racial theory]] &amp;ndash; and an [[Anti-communism|anti-Bolshevik]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans 2004 178–179&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J | author-link = Richard J.

==Nazi party==

In 1923, after the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]], Hitler, who had been imprisoned for [[treason]], appointed Rosenberg as the leader of the Nazi movement, a position he held until Hitler's release. Hitler remarked privately in later years that his choice of Rosenberg, whom he regarded as weak and lazy, was strategic; Hitler did not want the temporary leader of the Nazis to become too popular or hungry for power, because a person with either of those two qualities might not want to cede the party leadership after Hitler's release. However, at the time of the appointment Hitler had no reason to believe that he would soon be released, and Rosenberg had not appeared weak, so this may have been Hitler reading back into history his dissatisfaction with Rosenberg for the job he did.{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|pp=42–43}}

In 1929 Rosenberg founded the [[Militant League for German Culture]]. He later formed the &quot;[[Institute for Study of the Jewish Question|Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question]]&quot;, the first branch of a projected [[Advanced School of the NSDAP]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Grimsted&quot;&gt;Grimsted, Patricia Kennedy (2005). &quot;Roads to Ratibor: Library and archival plunder by the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg.&quot; ''Holocaust and Genocide Studies'', vol. 19, no. 3. pp. 390-458; here: p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMB&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.jmberlin.de/raub-und-restitution/en/glossar_i.php Institut zur Erforschung der Judenfrage (IEJ)]&quot; In: ''Glossary''.

He became a [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] Deputy in 1930 and published his book on [[Master race|racial theory]] ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' (''Der Mythus des 20.

&lt;/ref&gt; and disapproved of its pseudo-religious tone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans 2004 178–179&quot;/&gt;

Rosenberg helped convince Hitler, whose early speeches focused on revenge against France and Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Clu5vSF3IIYC&amp;q=ian+kershaw+hitler+beerhall+agitator&amp;pg=PR10-IA25|title=Hitler|last=Kershaw|first=Ian|date=2013-03-07|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-0-14-190959-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that communism was a serious threat to Germany. &quot;[[Jewish-Bolshevism]]&quot; became an ideological target for Nazism during the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans 2004 178–179&quot;/&gt;

In Rome during November 1932 Rosenberg participated in the [[Volta Conference]] about Europe. British historian [[Sir Charles Petrie]] met him there and regarded him with great distaste; Petrie was a Catholic and strongly objected to Rosenberg's anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks at His World'' (London, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1972), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, once Hitler had become Chancellor, Rosenberg was named leader of the [[NSDAP Office of Foreign Affairs|Nazi Party's Foreign Policy Office]] in April, and on 2 June 1933 he was named a Reichsleiter, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party.&lt;ref&gt;Orlow, Dietrich (1973) ''The History of the Nazi Party: 1933-1945'' Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: University of Pittsburgh Press. p.74. {{ISBN|0-822-93253-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another event of 1933 was Rosenberg's visit to Britain, intended to give the impression that the Nazis would not be a threat and to encourage links between the new regime and the [[British Empire]]. It was a notable failure. When Rosenberg laid a wreath bearing a [[swastika]] at [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate slashed it and later threw it in the [[Thames]] and was fined 40 shillings for willful damage at Bow Street magistrate’s court.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dr. Rosenberg's Wreath.&quot; Times [London, England] 12 May 1933: 11.

==Racial theories==
{{Nazism sidebar}}
As the Nazi Party's chief racial theorist, Rosenberg oversaw the construction of a human racial &quot;ladder&quot; that justified Hitler's racial and ethnic policies. Rosenberg built on the works of [[Arthur de Gobineau]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Madison Grant]] and the [[Klansman]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]] as well as on the beliefs of Hitler. Rosenberg placed Blacks and Jews at the very bottom of the ladder, while at the very top stood the &quot;[[Aryan]]&quot; race. Rosenberg promoted the [[Nordic theory]] which regarded Nordics as the &quot;[[master race]]&quot;,&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;No people of Europe is racially homogeneous, also Germany is not. According to the latest research, we accept five races all of which reveal perceptibly different types. But it is beyond question that the true culture bearer for Europe has been in the first place the Nordic race. Great heroes, artists and founders of states have grown from this blood.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.576&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Though Rosenberg does not use the word &quot;master race&quot;. He uses the word &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; (i.e. ruling people) twice in his book ''The Myth'', first referring to the [[Amorite]]s (saying that [[Archibald Sayce|Sayce]] described them as fair skinned and blue eyed) and secondly quoting [[Victor Wallace Germains]]' description of the English in &quot;The Truth about Kitchener&quot;. (&quot;The Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot;) - Pages 26, 660 - 1930&lt;/ref&gt; superior to all others, including to other Aryans (Indo-Europeans). He was also influenced by the [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory]] promoted by the Catholic [[counter-revolutionary]] tradition, such as the book ''Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens'' (1869) by [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]], which he translated into German under the title ''The Eternal Jew''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg got the racial term ''[[Untermensch]]'' from the title of Stoddard's 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man'', which had been adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;

Rosenberg reshaped Nazi racial policy over the years, but it always consisted of Aryan supremacy, extreme German nationalism and rabid antisemitism. Rosenberg also outspokenly opposed [[homosexuality]] – notably in his pamphlet &quot;Der Sumpf&quot; (&quot;The Swamp&quot;, 1927). He viewed homosexuality as a hindrance to the expansion of the Nordic population.

Rosenberg's attitude towards [[Slav]]s was flexible and depended on the particular nation involved.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;The Czechs, for their part, were stratified by race into a Nordic-Slavic nobility, and lower orders of an Alpine Dinaric stamp, thus displaying that type which the modern Czech so plainly embodies.&quot; Page 108, &quot;The one eyed maniacal Ziska of Trocnow, whose head in the Prague National Museum shows him to have been an eastern hither Asiatic type, was the first expression of this totally destructive Taborite movement, which the Czechs must thank for the extermination of the last remaining Germanic powers active within them, as well as the repression of all that was truly Slavic.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;The entire east is diversified throughout; one will need to speak here of the Russian character, of the Germanised peoples of Finland, Estonia and Lithuania, whereat also Poland has developed its clearly outlined individuality.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.643&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the ideology of &quot;[[Drang nach Osten]]&quot; (&quot;Drive to the East&quot;), Rosenberg saw his mission as the conquest and colonization of the Slavic East.&lt;ref&gt;''Oświęcim, 1940–1945: przewodnik po muzeum'', Kazimierz Smoleń, Państwowe Muzeum w Oświęcimiu, 1978, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metapolitics: from Wagner and the German Romantics to Hitler, page 221, Peter Viereck, Transaction Publishers 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts'' Rosenberg describes Russian Slavs as being overwhelmed by Bolshevism.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Alfred Rosenberg, Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts: Eine Wertung der seelischgeistigen Gestaltungskämpfe unserer Zeit, München: Hoheneichen, 1930, here p.214: In the year 1917, Russian Man finally disintegrated. He fell into two parts. The Nordic Russian blood gave up the struggle, the eastern Mongolian, powerfully stirred up, summoned Chinese and desert peoples to its aid, Jews and Armenians pushed forward to leadership, and the Kalmuch Tartar [[Lenin]] became master. The demonry of this blood directed itself instinctively against everything which outwardly still had some honest effect, looked manly and Nordic, like a living reproach against a type of man whom Lothrop Stoddard described as &quot;subhuman&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Ukrainians, he favoured setting up a buffer state to ease pressure on the German eastern frontier, while agreeing with the notion of the exploitation of Russia for the benefit of Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russian Liberation Movement page 30&quot;&gt;Andreyev, Caterine (1990)
''Vlasov and the Russian Liberation Movement: Soviet Reality and Émigré Theories'' London: Cambridge University Press. p.30. {{ISBN|0521389607}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Rosenberg was in favour of collaboration with the East Slavs against Bolshevism and offering them national independence unlike other Nazis such as Hitler and Himmler who dismissed such ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Ulrich (1997) ''Hitler's Foreign Workers: Enforced Foreign Labor in Germany Under the Third Reich'' London: Cambridge University Press. pp.260–261 {{ISBN|0521470005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hertstein, Robert Edwin (1979) ''The war that Hitler won: Goebbels and the Nazi media campaign'', UK: Hamish Hamilton. p.364 {{ISBN|0241100917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious theories==
Rosenberg argued for a new &quot;religion of the blood&quot;, based on the supposed innate promptings of the Nordic soul to defend its noble character against racial and cultural degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, 1972, s. 85&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that this had been embodied in early [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] religions, notably ancient European ([[Celtic tribes|Celtic]], [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]]) [[paganism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic Hinduism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

In his 1920 book ''Immorality in the Talmud'', Rosenberg identified Jews with the Antichrist.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;The hate of Jesus combined with an unfathomable lack of understanding for Jesus that is showing in the works of today's Jewry almost without disguise and culminates in the systematic Jewish bolshevik persecution of Christianity in Russia goes back almost 2000 years. The personality of Christ was the strongest storm against Jewish being, which the Jew has always felt and known and only Christian uber-tolerance could deem it possible to build a bridge. There can be no peace between Christ and the Antichrist; there can only be a winner.&quot;&lt;br&gt; Original in German: &quot;Der Haß, verbunden mit abgrundtiefer Verständnislosigkeit der Person Jesu gegenüber, der in den Erzeugnissen der heutigen Juden kaum mehr verhüllt zum Ausdruck kommt und in den planmäßigen Christenverfolgungen seitens der jüdischen bolschewistischen Machthaber in Rußland seinen Höhepunkt erreicht hat, dieser Haß dauert jetzt bald 2000 Jahre unverändert fort. Die Persönlichkeit Christi ist der stärkste Ansturm gegen jüdisches Wesen; das hat der Jude von jeher gefühlt und gewußt, einzig christliche Übertoleranz könnte glauben, hier eine Brücke schlagen zu können. Frieden kann es zwischen Christ und Antichrist nicht geben; es siegt entweder der eine oder der andere.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Rosenberg, Alfred (1943) [1920] ''Unmoral im Talmud''. Franz Eher Verlag, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected Christianity for its universality, for its doctrine of [[original sin]] (at least for Germans who he declared on one occasion were born noble), and for its teachings on the [[immortality of the soul]],{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|pp=84–85}} saying, &quot;indeed, absorbing Christianity enfeebled a people.&quot;{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|p=92}} Publicly, Rosenberg affected to deplore Christianity's degeneration owing to Jewish influence.{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|p=85}}  Following Chamberlain's ideas, he condemned what he called &quot;negative Christianity&quot; (the orthodox beliefs of Protestant and Catholic churches), arguing instead for a so-called [[positive Christianity|&quot;positive&quot; Christianity]]&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;From the description of Jesus one can select very different features. His personality often makes its appearance as soft and pitying, then, again, bluff and rough. But it is always supported by inward fire. It was in the interest of the Roman church, with its lust for power, to represent subservient humility as the essence of Christ in order to create as many servants as possible for this motivated 'ideal'. To correct this representation is a further ineradicable requirement of the German movement for renewal. Jesus appears to us today as self-confident lord in the best and highest sense of the word.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p. 604&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;For this reason Jesus, in spite of all Christian churches, signifies a pivotal point in our history. He became the god of the Europeans, yet, not seldom did he appear in a repellent distortion.&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the concentrated feeling of personality which built Gothic cathedrals and inspired a [[w:Rembrandt|Rembrandt]] portrait penetrated more clearly into the consciousness of the general public, a new wave of culture would begin. But the prerequisite for this is the overcoming of the former statutory values of the 'Christian' churches.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p. 391&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; based on Chamberlain's argument that Jesus was a member of an Indo-European, Nordic enclave resident in ancient [[Galilee]] who struggled against Judaism.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg quotes Dr. Emil Jung referring to statements by the Syrian Christian preacher [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephraem]] (4th century): &quot;Jesus' mother was a Danaite woman (that is, someone born in Dan), and he had a Latin as father. Ephraem sees this to be not unhonorable and adds: 'Jesus thus derived his ancestry from two of the greatest and most famous nations, namely, from the Syrians on the maternal side and from the Romans on the paternal.'&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot;'' (1930), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;Herder once demanded that the religion dedicated to Jesus should become a religion of Jesus. This was what Chamberlain strove for. A completely free man who disposed inwardly over the entire culture of our times, he has shown the deepest sensitivity for the superhuman simplicity of Christ. He represented Jesus as what he had once appeared to be: a mediator between man and god.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot;'' (1930), p. 623&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, in his work explicating the Nazi intellectual belief system, ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', Rosenberg cryptically alludes to and lauds the early Christian heretic [[Marcionism|Marcion]] (who rejected the Old Testament as well as the notion of Christ as the Jewish Messiah) and the Manichaean-inspired, &quot;Aryo-Iranian&quot; [[Cathari]], as being the more authentic interpreters of Christianity versus historically dominant Judaeo-Christianity;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;It is characteristic of Roman Christianity that where possible it eliminates the personality of its founder, in order to put in its place the church structure of a rulership by priests.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; moreover these ancient, externally Christian metaphysical forms were more &quot;organically compatible with the Nordic sense of the spiritual and the Nordic 'blood-soul'.&quot; For Rosenberg, the anti-intellectual, religious [[doctrine]] was inseparable&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;The ancient Germanic idea of god is likewise inconceivable without spiritual freedom. Jesus also spoke of the kingdom of heaven within us. The strength of spiritual search already shows itself in the world wanderer, Odin, and can be seen in the seeker and believer, [[Meister Eckhart|Eckehart]], and we see it in all great men from [[Martin Luther|Luther]] to [[Paul de Lagarde|Lagarde]]. This soul also lived within the venerable [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomas of Aquinas]]&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; and in the majority of the occidental fathers of the church.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; from serving the interests of the Nordic race, connecting the individual to his racial nature.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote:&quot;A keen observer has correctly remarked that the Jesus child of the Sistine Madonna is &quot;frankly heroic&quot; in gaze and posture (Wölfflin). That is aptly expressed except that the fundamental ground is lacking as to why the allegedly Jewish family had a heroic look to it. Here, only composition and color distribution, not &quot;inwardness&quot; and &quot;dedication&quot;, are determining. These are the prerequisites to the success of a formative will, once again, the racial ideal of beauty. To see in place of the light-brown haired, light skinned Jesus child a blue black, woolly haired, brown skinned Jew boy would be an impossibility. Equally, we cannot think of a Jewish Mother of God next to the holy, even if the latter had the &quot;noble face&quot; of an Offenbach or Disraeli.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg stated that &quot;The general ideas of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman]] and of the Protestant churches are negative Christianity and do not, therefore, accord with our (German) soul.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Churchmen to Hitler | date=10 August 1936 | work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762289,00.html?promoid=googlep |access-date= 14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;The Jewish idea of the &quot;slave of god&quot;, one who receives mercy from an arbitrary, absolutist god, has thus passed over to Rome and Wittenberg, and can be attributed to Paul as the actual creator of this doctrine, which is to say that our churches are not Christian but Pauline. Jesus unquestionably praised the One-Being with god. This was his redemption, his goal. He did not preach a condescending granting of mercy from an almighty being in the face of which even the greatest human soul represented a pure nothingness. This doctrine of mercy is naturally very welcome to every church. With such misinterpretation the church and its leaders appear as the &quot;representatives of god&quot;. Consequently, they could acquire power by granting mercy through their magic hands.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; His support for Luther as a great German figure was always ambivalent.{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|pp=87–88}}&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;Now we may certainly also say that the love of Jesus Christ has been the love of one who is conscious of his aristocracy of soul and of his strong personality. Jesus sacrificed himself as a master, not as a servant ... And also Martin Luther knew only too well, what he said, when shortly before his death he wrote 'These three words, free – Christian – German, are to the pope and the Roman court nothing but mere poison, death, devil and hell. They can neither suffer, see nor hear them. Nothing else will come of it, that is certain.'&quot; (''Against the papacy donated by the devil in Rome'', 1645) ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p. 622&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;In all seriousness, the Cosmic God was said to be identical with the dubious spiritual assertions of the Old Testament! Hebrew polytheism was elevated to a model of monotheism, and no deeper knowledge had come to Lutheran theology from the original magnificent Aryan-Persian idea of the world and the cosmic comprehension of God. In addition there appeared the revering of Paul, an original sin of protestantism, against which [[Paul de Lagarde|Lagarde]], as is known, attacked by the entire official theology of his day, fought in vain.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: &quot;However richly talented, however powerful and surpassing in forms it was, until the present, we have still not created a religious form worthy of us: neither [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] nor [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] are founders of a religion for us.&quot; ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II Rosenberg outlined the future envisioned by the Hitler government for religion in Germany, with a thirty-point program for the future of the German churches. Among its articles:

* the National Reich Church of Germany would claim exclusive control over all churches
* publication of the Bible would cease
* crucifixes, Bibles and saints were to be removed from altars
* ''Mein Kampf'' would be placed on altars as &quot;to the German nation and therefore to God the most sacred book&quot;
* the Christian Cross would be removed from all churches and replaced with the swastika.&lt;ref name=&quot;William L. Shirer p240&quot;/&gt;

==Wartime activities==

In 1940 Rosenberg was made head of the ''[[Hohe Schule der NSDAP|Hohe Schule]]'' (literally &quot;high school&quot;, but the German phrase refers to a college), the Centre of National Socialist Ideological and Educational Research, out of which the ''[[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]]'' (Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce) developed for the purpose of [[Nazi plunder|looting art and cultural goods]]. The ERR were especially active in Paris in looting art stolen from famous Jewish families such as the [[Rothschilds]] and that of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. [[Hermann Göring]] used the ERR to collect art for his own personal gratification.&lt;ref&gt;Löhr, Hanns Christian (2018): '' Kunst als Waffe – Der Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg, Ideologie und Kunstraub im „Dritten Reich“'', Gebr. Mann, p. 38 ff. {{ISBN|978-3-7861-2806-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He created a &quot;Special Task Force for Music&quot; (''Sonderstab Musik'') to collect the best [[musical instrument]]s and scores for use in a university to be built in Hitler's home town of [[Linz]], [[Austria]]. The orders given to the ''Sonderstab Musik'' were to loot all forms of Jewish property in Germany and of those found in any country taken over by the German army, and any musical instruments or scores were to be immediately shipped to [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Vries, Willem de (2000): Kunstraub im Westen, Alfred Rosenberg und der ''Sonderstab Musik'', S.Fischer Verlag. {{ISBN|3-596-14768-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories===
Following [[Operation Barbarossa|the invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], Rosenberg was appointed head of the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]] (''Reichsministerium für die besetzten Ostgebiete'') on 17 July 1941. [[Alfred Meyer]] served as his deputy and represented him at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. Another official of the Ministry, [[Georg Leibbrandt]], also attended the conference, at Rosenberg's request.

Rosenberg had presented Hitler with his plan for the organization of the conquered Eastern territories, suggesting the establishment of new administrative districts, to replace the previously [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-controlled territories with new [[Reichskommissar]]iats. These would be:

* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]]'' ([[Baltic countries]] and [[Belarus]]),
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]]'' ([[Ukraine]] and nearest territories),
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Kaukasus]]'' ([[Caucasus]] area),
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Moskau|Moskau]]'' (Moscow metropolitan area and the rest of nearest Russian European areas)

[[File:Alfred Rosenberg's office from 1942.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Former Nazi Ministry for Occupied Eastern Territories, Berlin (2014)]]

Although Rosenberg regarded all the Soviet peoples as subhumans for their communist beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;[[David Irving|Irving, David]] (1996) ''Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich'', London: Focal Point. p. 769. {{ISBN|1872197132}}&lt;/ref&gt; such suggestions were intended to encourage certain non-[[Russia]]n nationalism and to promote German interests for the benefit of future [[Aryan race|Aryan]] generations, in accord with geopolitical &quot;[[Lebensraum]] im Osten&quot; plans. They would provide a buffer against Soviet expansion in preparation for the total eradication of Communism and [[Bolshevism]] by decisive pre-emptive military action.

Following these plans, when [[Wehrmacht]] forces invaded Soviet-controlled territory, they immediately implemented the first of the proposed Reichskommissariats of [[Ostland]] and [[Ukraine]], under the leadership of [[Hinrich Lohse]] and [[Erich Koch]], respectively. The organization of these administrative territories led to conflict between Rosenberg and the [[SS]] over the treatment of [[Slavs]] under German occupation. As Nazi Germany's chief racial theorist, Rosenberg considered Slavs, though lesser than Germans, to be Aryan. Rosenberg often complained to Hitler and Himmler about the treatment of non-Jewish occupied peoples.&lt;ref name = &quot;kev&quot;&gt;Kevin P. Spicer, ''Antisemitism, Christian ambivalence, and the Holocaust'', Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, Indiana University Press, 2007, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the creation of buffer satellite states made out of Greater Finland, Baltica, Ukraine, and Caucasus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russian Liberation Movement page 30&quot;/&gt;

In an 18 November 1941 [[press conference]] speaking about the Jewish Question, he said:
{{quote|Some six million Jews still live in the East, and this question can only be solved by a biological extermination of the whole of Jewry in Europe. The Jewish Question will only be solved for Germany when the last Jew has left German territory, and for Europe when not a single Jew stands on the European continent as far as the Urals... And to this end it is necessary to force them beyond the Urals or otherwise bring about their eradication.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Longerich, Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews, p.289&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the [[Nuremberg trials]] he said he was ignorant of the [[Holocaust]], despite the fact that Leibbrandt and Meyer were present at the [[Wannsee conference]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishvirtuallibrary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Leibbrandt.html|title=Georg Leibbrandt &amp;#124; Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime propaganda efforts===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0168, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg|thumb|150px|Photograph by [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]], 1941]]

Since the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] intended to impose the [[New Order (political system)|New Order]], it was essentially a war of conquest. German propaganda efforts designed to win over Russian opinion were, at best, patchy and inconsistent. Alfred Rosenberg was one of the few in the Nazi hierarchy who advocated a policy designed to encourage [[anti-Communist]] opinion among the population of the occupied territories. His interest here was mainly in the non-Russian areas such as Ukraine and the Baltic States; however, supporters of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] were somewhat able to win him over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.feldgrau.com/WW2-German-Wehrmacht-Russian-Volunteers/ Russian Volunteers in the Wehrmacht]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst other things, Rosenberg issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms (''[[kolkhoz]]''). He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming and restoring family farms for those willing to collaborate with the occupiers. But decollectivisation conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and [[Hermann Göring]] demanded that the collective farms be retained, save for a change of name. Hitler himself denounced the redistribution of land as &quot;stupid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Leonid Grenkevich, ''The Soviet Partisan Movement, 1941–1945: A Critical Historiographical Analysis'', Routledge, New York, 1999, pp. 169–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were numerous German armed forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') posters asking for assistance in the ''Bandenkrieg,'' the war against the [[Soviet partisans]], though, once again, German policy had the effect of adding to their problems. Posters for &quot;volunteer&quot; labour, with inscriptions such as &quot;Come work with us to shorten the war&quot;, hid the appalling realities faced by [[OST-Arbeiter|Russian workers in Germany]]. Many people joined the partisans rather than risk being sent to an unknown fate in the west.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Another of Rosenberg's initiatives, the &quot;Free Caucasus&quot; campaign, was rather more successful, attracting various nationalities into the so-called Eastern Legion (''[[Ostlegionen]]''), though in the end this made little difference in the outcome of the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].

He was sentenced to death and executed with other condemned co-defendants at Nuremberg Prison on the morning of [[Nuremberg executions|16 October 1946]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ushmm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10007070 |title=International Military Tribunal: The Defendants |publisher=ushmm.org|access-date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body, like those of the other nine executed men and that of [[Hermann Göring]], was cremated at [[Ostfriedhof (Munich)]] and the ashes were scattered in the river [[Isar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Throughout the trial, it was agreed that Rosenberg had a decisive role in shaping Nazi philosophy and ideology. Examples include: his book ''[[Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', which was published in 1930, where he incited hatred against &quot;[[Liberal Imperialists|Liberal Imperialism]]&quot; and &quot;Bolshevik [[Marxism]]&quot;; furthering the influence of the &quot;[[Lebensraum]]&quot; idea in Germany during the war; facilitating the persecution of Christian churches and the Jews in particular; and opposition to the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Treaty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uwe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/Rosenberg.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000829090723/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/Rosenberg.htm |archive-date=29 August 2000 |url-status=dead |title=Alfred Rosenberg Nuremberg Charges |access-date=16 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tercer-reich.com/politicos/los-argumentos-de-la-defensa-de-alfred-rosenberg-y-fritz-sauckel-en-los-juicios-de-nuremberg/ Rosenberg case for the defense at Nuremberg trials] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223104156/http://www.tercer-reich.com/politicos/los-argumentos-de-la-defensa-de-alfred-rosenberg-y-fritz-sauckel-en-los-juicios-de-nuremberg/ |date=23 February 2011 }} (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joseph Kingsbury-Smith, who covered the executions for the [[International News Service]], Rosenberg was the only condemned man who, when asked at the gallows if he had any [[last statement]] to make, replied with only one word: &quot;No&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Kingsbury |title=The Execution of Nazi War Criminals |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/NurembergNews10_16_46.html |access-date=17 November 2019 |agency=International News Service |date=16 October 1946 |location=Nuremberg Gaol, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi policy and Rosenberg's views==
Hitler was a leader oriented towards practical politics, whereas, for Rosenberg, religion and philosophy were key and he was the most culturally influential within the party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steigmann-Gall2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Steigmann-Gall|title=The Holy Reich: Nazi conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RreXLeUG_AIC&amp;pg=PA91|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82371-5|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several accounts of the time before the Nazi ascension to power speak of Hitler as being a mouthpiece for Rosenberg's views, and he clearly exerted a great deal of intellectual influence.{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|p=45}}

The question of Rosenberg's influence in the Nazi Party is controversial. He was perceived as lacking the charisma and political skills of the other Nazi leaders, and was somewhat isolated. In some of his speeches Hitler appeared to be close to Rosenberg's views, rejecting traditional Christianity as a religion based on Jewish culture, preferring an ethnically and culturally pure &quot;Race&quot; whose destiny was supposed to be assigned to the German people by &quot;Providence&quot;. In others, he adhered to the Nazi Party line, which advocated a &quot;positive Christianity&quot;.

After Hitler's assumption of power he moved to reassure the Protestant and Catholic churches that the party was not intending to reinstitute [[Germanic paganism]]. He placed himself in the position of being the man to save Positive Christianity from utter destruction at the hands of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|atheistic antitheist Communist]]s of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9SBndd4Jc0QC|title=The 'Hitler Myth': Image and Reality in the Third Reich|author=Kershaw, Ian|year= 2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
|page= 109|isbn= 0-19-280206-2|oclc = 47063365
|quote = Hitler's evident ability to simulate, even to potentially critical Church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity was crucial to the mediation of such an image to the church-going public by influential members of both major denominations. It was the reason why church-going Christians, so often encouraged by their 'opinion-leaders' in the Church hierarchies, were frequently able to exclude Hitler from their condemnation of the anti-Christian Party radicals, continuing to see in him the last hope of protecting Christianity from Bolshevism.
|author-link= Ian Kershaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially true immediately before and after the elections of 1932; Hitler wanted to appear non-threatening to major Christian faiths and consolidate his power.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Furthermore, Hitler felt that Catholic–Protestant infighting had been a major factor in weakening the German state and allowing its dominance by foreign powers.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Some Nazi leaders, such as [[Martin Bormann]], were [[anti-Christian]] and sympathetic to Rosenberg.&lt;ref&gt;Stiegmann-Gall, Richard, ''The Holy Reich'', CUP, pp. 243–5&lt;/ref&gt; Once in power, Hitler and most Nazi leaders sought to unify the Christian denominations in favor of &quot;positive Christianity&quot;. Hitler privately condemned mystical and pseudoreligious interests as &quot;nonsense&quot;.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=141,212}} However, he and [[Joseph Goebbels]] agreed that after the ''[[Endsieg]]'' (Final Victory) the [[Protestant Reich Church|Reich Church]] should be pressed into evolving into a German [[social evolutionism|social evolutionist]] organisation proclaiming the cult of race, blood and battle, instead of [[Redemption (religious)|Redemption]] and the [[Ten Commandments]] of [[Moses]], which they deemed outdated and Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Hürten, H. &quot;'Endlösung' für den Katholizismus? Das nationalsozialistische Regime und seine Zukunftspläne gegenüber der Kirche,&quot; in: ''[[Stimmen der Zeit]]'', 203 (1985) pp. 534–546&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinrich Himmler]]'s views were among the closest to Rosenberg's, and their estrangement was perhaps created by Himmler's abilities to put into action what Rosenberg had only written. Also, while Rosenberg thought Christianity should be allowed to die out, Himmler actively set out to create countering pagan rituals.{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|p=119}}

Lieutenant Colonel William Harold Dunn (1898–1955) wrote a medical and psychiatric report on him in prison to evaluate him as a suicide risk: &lt;blockquote&gt;He gave the impression of clinging to his own theories in a fanatical and unyielding fashion and to have been little influenced by the unfolding during the trial of the cruelty and crimes of the party.{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|p=219}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Summarizing the unresolved conflict between the personal views of Rosenberg and the pragmatism of the Nazi elite:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ruthless pursuit of Nazi aims turned out to mean not, as Rosenberg had hoped, the permeation of German life with the new ideology; it meant concentration of the combined resources of party and state on [[total war]].{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|p=160}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Family life==
Rosenberg was married twice.  In 1915, he married [[:et:Hilda Leesmann|Hilda Leesmann]], an ethnic [[Estonians|Estonian]]; they divorced in 1923. Two years later, in 1925 he married Hedwig Kramer,{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|p=52}} to whom he remained wed until his execution by the Allies. He and Kramer had two children: a son who died in [[infancy]] and a daughter, Irene, who was born in 1930.{{Sfn|Cecil|1972|pp=52–53}}

During the [[Nuremberg trials]], Rosenberg's handwritten diary was translated by [[Harry Fiss]], Chief of Documentation for the American prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countytimes.com/news/morris-resident-was-translator-during-nuremberg-war-trials/article_da2d658c-6b30-5c99-b726-3805aded2468.html |title=Morris Resident Was Translator During Nuremberg War Trials |last=Tragakiss |first=Tamara |date=23 November 2005 |website=The Litchfield County Times |publisher=Hearst Media Services Connecticut |access-date=31 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its use in evidence during the Nuremberg trials, the diary went missing, along with other material which had been given to the prosecutor [[Robert Kempner]] (1899–1993).&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Charles | last = Fenyvesi | title = Mysteries of the Lost (and Found) Nazi Diaries | date = 14 June 2012 | work = National Geographic }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recovered in Lewiston, N.Y., on 13 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wkbw.com/news/Federal-Officials-Reveal-Diary-of-High-Level-Nazi-Leader-Found-in-WNY-211415701.html Federal Officials Reveal Diary of High-Level Nazi Leader Found in WNY]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015151512/http://www.wkbw.com/news/Federal-Officials-Reveal-Diary-of-High-Level-Nazi-Leader-Found-in-WNY-211415701.html |date=15 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Written on 425 loose-leaf pages, with entries dating from 1936 through 1944, it is now the property of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] (USHMM) in Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo&quot;/&gt; Henry Mayer, the museum's senior archivist, and the son of a Holocaust survivor, was able to access the material and while &quot;not given enough time to read [the] diary entry from beginning to end,&quot; he &quot;could see that Rosenberg focused on certain subjects, including brutality against Jews and other ethnic groups and forcing the civilian population of occupied Russia to serve Germany.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo&quot;/&gt; Meyer also noted Rosenberg's &quot;hostile comments about Nazi leaders,&quot; which he described as &quot;unvarnished.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo&quot;/&gt; While some parts of the manuscript had been previously published, the majority had been lost for decades. Former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent [[Robert King Wittman]], who helped track down the diary, said, &quot;there is no place in the diary where we have Rosenberg or Hitler saying the Jews should be exterminated, all it said was 'move them out of Europe'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT31mar16&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/books/tracking-an-elusive-diary-from-hitlers-inner-circle.html | title=Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle | work=The New York Times| date=31 March 2016 | access-date=3 April 2016 | author=Kovaleski, Serge F. | pages=C1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' said of the search for the missing manuscript that &quot;the tangled journey of the diary could itself be the subject of a television mini-series.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|title=Diary of a Hitler Aide Resurfaces After a Hunt That Lasted Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/world/europe/diary-of-a-hitler-aide-resurfaces-after-a-hunt-that-lasted-years.html?_r=0|access-date=15 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Encontrado el diario de un confidente de Hitler |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20130610/54375860192/encontrado-diario-confidente-hitler.html | agency = Reuters | location =Barcelona, Spain | date = 10 June 2013 | work= [[La Vanguardia]] | language = es |trans-title=Found the diary of a confidant of Hitler| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131014030133/http://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20130610/54375860192/encontrado-diario-confidente-hitler.html| archive-date = 14 October 2013 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

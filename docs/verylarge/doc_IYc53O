Another model is the FEELS model developed by Xie Bangxiu and deployed successfully in China. &quot;FEELS&quot; stands for five things in curriculum and education: Flexible-goals, Engaged-learner, Embodied-knowledge, Learning-through-interactions, and Supportive-teacher.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;FEELS: A Constructive Postmodern Approach To Curriculum and Education&quot;, Xie Bangxiu, JesusJazzBuddhism.org, accessed 5 December 2013, http://www.jesusjazzbuddhism.org/feels.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102202438/http://www.jesusjazzbuddhism.org/feels.html |date=2 November 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for understanding and evaluating educational curriculum under the assumption that the purpose of education is to &quot;help a person become whole.&quot; This work is in part the product of cooperation between Chinese government organizations and the Institute for the Postmodern Development of China.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.vancouversun&quot; /&gt;

Whitehead's philosophy of education has also found institutional support in Canada, where the [[University of Saskatchewan]] created a Process Philosophy Research Unit and sponsored several conferences on process philosophy and education.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;International Conferences – University of Saskatchewan&quot;, University of Saskatchewan, accessed 5 December 2013, https://www.usask.ca/usppru/international-conferences.php.&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Woodhouse at the University of Saskatchewan remains a strong proponent of Whiteheadian education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usask.ca/education/profiles/woodhouse/index.php &quot;Dr. Howard Woodhouse&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507014657/http://www.usask.ca/education/profiles/woodhouse/index.php |date=7 May 2016 }}, University of Saskatchewan, accessed 5 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Three recent books which further develop Whitehead's philosophy of education include: ''Modes of Learning: Whitehead's Metaphysics and the Stages of Education'' (2012) by George Allan; ''The Adventure of Education: Process Philosophers on Learning, Teaching, and Research'' (2009) by Adam Scarfe; and &quot;Educating for an Ecological Civilization: Interdisciplinary, Experiential, and Relational Learning&quot; (2017) edited by Marcus Ford and Stephen Rowe. &quot;Beyond the Modern University: Toward a Constructive Postmodern University,&quot; (2002) is another text that explores the importance of Whitehead's metaphysics for thinking about higher education.

===Business administration===
Whitehead has had some influence on philosophy of [[business administration]] and [[organizational theory]].  This has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events (as opposed to static things) within organizations through an &quot;organization studies&quot; discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak' and 'strong' process perspectives from a number of philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Tor Hernes, ''A Process Theory of Organization'' (Oxford University Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and [[Panpsychism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialist]] stance towards [[management]] is Mark Dibben,&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Dibben and [[John B. Cobb Jr.]], &quot;Special Focus: Process Thought and Organization Studies,&quot; in ''Process Studies 32'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; who works in what he calls &quot;applied process thought&quot; to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the [[social science]]s through the lens of [[Process philosophy|process metaphysics]]. For Dibben, this allows &quot;a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing, as opposed to occasional – and thoroughly passive – happening.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mark Dibben – School of Management – University of Tasmania, Australia&quot;, last modified 16 July 2013, University of Tasmania, accessed 21 November 2013, http://www.utas.edu.au/business-and-economics/people/profiles/accounting/Mark-Dibben {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213231701/http://www.utas.edu.au/business-and-economics/people/profiles/accounting/Mark-Dibben |date=13 December 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dibben has published two books on applied process thought, ''[https://www.academia.edu/6359574/Mark_Dibben_and_Thomas_Kelly_eds._Applied_Process_Thought_I_Initial_Explorations_in_Theory_and_Research_2008 Applied Process Thought I: Initial Explorations in Theory and Research]'' (2008), and ''[https://www.academia.edu/6359614/Mark_Dibben_and_Rebecca_Newton_eds._Applied_Process_Thought_II_Following_a_Trail_Ablaze_2009 Applied Process Thought II: Following a Trail Ablaze]'' (2009), as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and [[business ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dibben, &quot;Exploring the Processual Nature of Trust and Cooperation in Organisations: A Whiteheadian Analysis,&quot; in ''[[Philosophy of Management]] 4'' (2004): 25-39; Mark Dibben, &quot;Organisations and Organising: Understanding and Applying Whitehead’s Processual Account,&quot; in ''[[Philosophy of Management]] 7'' (2009); Cristina Neesham and Mark Dibben, &quot;The Social Value of Business: Lessons from Political Economy and Process Philosophy,&quot; in ''Applied Ethics: Remembering Patrick Primeaux'' (Research in Ethical Issues in Organizations, Volume 8), ed. Michael Schwartz and Howard Harris (Emerald Group Publishing Limited, 2012): 63-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Stout and Carrie M. Staton have also written recently on the mutual influence of Whitehead and [[Mary Parker Follett]], a pioneer in the fields of organizational theory and [[organizational behavior]].  Stout and Staton see both Whitehead and Follett as sharing an [[ontology]] that &quot;understands becoming as a relational process; difference as being related, yet unique; and the purpose of becoming as harmonizing difference.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Stout &amp; Carrie M. Staton, &quot;The Ontology of Process Philosophy in Follett's Administrative Theory&quot; ''Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis'' 33 (2011): 268.&lt;/ref&gt; This connection is further analyzed by Stout and Jeannine M. Love in ''Integrative Process: Follettian Thinking from Ontology to Administration''&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Stout &amp; Jeannine M. Love, ''Integrative Process: Follettian Thinking from Ontology to Administration'', (Anoka, MN: Process Century Press 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political views ===
Whitehead's political views sometimes appear to be [[libertarian]] without the label. He wrote:{{quote|Now the intercourse between individuals and between social groups takes one of two forms, force or persuasion. [[Commerce]] is the great example of intercourse by way of persuasion. [[War]], [[slavery]], and governmental compulsion exemplify the reign of force.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Ideas'' p. 105, 1933 edition; p. 83, 1967 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
On the other hand, many Whitehead scholars read his work as providing a philosophical foundation for the social liberalism of the [[Social liberalism|New Liberal]] movement that was prominent throughout Whitehead's adult life. Morris wrote that &quot;... there is good reason for claiming that Whitehead shared the social and political ideals of the new liberals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Randall C., ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 51: 75-92. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trams are a major form of [[Transport in Melbourne|public transport]] in [[Melbourne]], the capital city of the [[States of Australia|state]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. As of May 2017, the Melbourne tramway network consists of {{Convert|250|km|mi|abbr=off}} of double track, 493 trams, [[List of Melbourne tram routes|24 routes]], and 1,763 [[tram stop]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;YT facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yarratrams.com.au/about-us/who-we-are/facts-figures/ | work=[[Yarra Trams]] | title=Facts &amp; Figures | accessdate=13 October 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529000558/http://www.yarratrams.com.au/about-us/who-we-are/facts-figures/ | archive-date=29 May 2014 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is the largest operational urban tram network in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yarratrams.com.au/facts-figures|title=Facts &amp; figures – Yarra Trams|website=yarratrams.com.au|access-date=2019-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trams are the second most used form of public transport in overall boardings in Melbourne after the [[Railways in Melbourne|commuter railway network]], with a total of 206 million passenger trips in 2017&amp;ndash;18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Transport Victoria Annual Report 2017–18|url=https://static.ptv.vic.gov.au/PTV/PTV%20docs/AnnualReport/1537917277/2017-18-Annual-Report-accessible-version.pdf|publisher=Public Transport Victoria|accessdate=3 October 2018|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trams have operated continuously in Melbourne since 1885 (the horse tram line in [[Fairfield, Victoria|Fairfield]] opened in 1884, but was at best an irregular service). Since then they have become a distinctive part of Melbourne's character and feature in tourism and travel advertising. [[Melbourne cable tramway system|Melbourne's cable tram system]] opened in 1885, and expanded to one of the largest in the world, with {{convert|75|km|mi|1|abbr=off}} of double track. The first electric tram line opened in 1889, but closed only a few years later in 1896. In 1906 electric tram systems were opened in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] and [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], marking the start of continuous operation of Melbourne's electric trams.

Victoria's public transport system was reorganised in 1983 and saw the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board absorbed into the [[Metropolitan Transit Authority (Victoria)|Metropolitan Transit Authority]], which was in turn absorbed by the [[Public Transport Corporation]] in 1989. The network has been operated under contract since the commencement of franchising, following the privatisation of the Public Transport Corporation in 1999. The current private operator contracted to run Melbourne's tram system is [[Keolis Downer]], trading as [[Yarra Trams]].

Ticketing, public information and patronage promotion are undertaken by Victoria's public transport body, [[Public Transport Victoria]]. The multi-modal integrated ticketing system, [[myki]], currently operates across the tram network.

At some Melbourne intersections (most within the CBD), motor vehicles are required to perform a [[hook turn]], a manoeuvre designed to give trams priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/SafetyAndRules/RoadRules/Turning.htm | work=[[Vicroads]] | title=Turning | accessdate=10 October 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115100718/http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/SafetyAndRules/RoadRules/Turning.htm | archive-date=15 November 2011 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; To further improve tram speeds on congested Melbourne streets, trams also have priority in road usage, with specially fitted [[traffic lights]] and exclusive lanes being provided either at all times or in peak times, as well as other measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Moreinfoandservices/PublicTransport/TramProjects/ThinkTramProgram.htm | work=[[Vicroads]] | title=Think Tram Program | accessdate=19 October 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114222417/http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Moreinfoandservices/PublicTransport/TramProjects/ThinkTramProgram.htm | archivedate=14 November 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Moreinfoandservices/PublicTransport/TramProjects/TramPriorityAndSafety.htm | work=[[Vicroads]] | title=Tram priority &amp; safety | accessdate=19 October 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114222655/http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Moreinfoandservices/PublicTransport/TramProjects/TramPriorityAndSafety.htm | archive-date=14 November 2011 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of trams in Melbourne}}

===Horse trams===
Melbourne's first tram was a [[horse tram]] from [[Fairfield railway station, Melbourne|Fairfield railway station]] to a real estate development in [[Thornbury, Victoria|Thornbury]]; it opened on 20 December 1884, and was closed by 1890. Seven horse tramlines operated in Melbourne, three were built by the [[Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company]] (MTOC), while the other four were built by different private companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooves and iron: Melbourne's horse trams&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/horse.htm |title=Hooves and iron: Melbourne's horse trams |author=Russell Jones |year=2003 |work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MTOC's three lines fed their cable tram system: [[Victoria Bridge, Melbourne|Victoria Bridge]] cable tram terminus to Kew ([[Boroondara Cemetery]]), opened in 1887 and closed in 1915 after its sale to [[City of Kew|Kew Council]] for conversion to a [[Prahran &amp; Malvern Tramways Trust]] electric line; [[Hawthorn Bridge]] cable tram terminus to Auburn Road, via Burwood Road, Power Street and Riversdale Road, opened in 1890 and closed on 31 January 1916 after being sold to the [[Hawthorn Tramways Trust]] for conversion to electric traction; and the Zoo line, from the [[Royal Parade, Melbourne|Royal Parade]] cable line to [[Melbourne Zoo|Melbourne Zoological Gardens]], opened on 10 March 1890 and closed in November 1923. The Zoo line was Melbourne's last horse tram and the only line still in operation at the formation of the [[Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board]] (MMTB), however it was destroyed by fire during the [[1923 Victorian Police strike|1923 police strike]]; the MMTB took the decision not to reopen it, thus ending Melbourne's horse tram era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooves and iron: Melbourne's horse trams&quot;/&gt;

===Cable trams===

[[File:Melbourne cable tram 1905.jpg|thumb|left|Cable tram (dummy and trailer)&lt;br /&gt;in Lonsdale Street, circa 1905]]
Melbourne's cable tram system has its origins in the MTOC, started by Francis Boardman Clapp in 1877, with a view to operate a Melbourne tram system. After some initial resistance, he successfully lobbied the government who passed the Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company Act 1883 on 10 October 1883, granting the company the right to operate a [[cable car (railway)|cable tram]] system in Melbourne. Although several lines were originally intended to be horse trams, and the MTOC did operate three horse tram lines on the edges of the system, the core of the system was built as cable trams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francis Boardman Clapp: transport entrepreneur&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/clapp.htm |title=Francis Boardman Clapp: transport entrepreneur |author=Russell Jones |year=2002 |work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company Limited&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tramway.org.au/runningjournal/rj_vol9_no3.pdf |title=The Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company Limited |date=June 1972 |work=[[Running Journal]] Vol9 No3 |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=10 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512234645/http://www.tramway.org.au/runningjournal/rj_vol9_no3.pdf |archivedate=12 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act established the Melbourne Tramways Trust (MTT), which was made up of the 12 municipalities that the MTOC system would serve. The MTT was responsible for the construction of tracks and engine house, while the MTOC built the depots, offices and arranged for the delivery or construction of the rolling stock. The MTT granted a lease to operate the system until 1 July 1916 to the MTOC, with the MTOC paying 4.5% interest on the debts incurred by the MTT in building the system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francis Boardman Clapp: transport entrepreneur&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company Limited&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Melbourne’s first cable tram.jpg|thumb|Melbourne's first cable tram service on 11 November 1885]]
The first cable tram line opened on 11 November 1885, running from [[Bourke Street]] to [[Hawthorn Bridge]], along [[Spencer Street]], [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders Street]], Wellington Parade and Bridge Road, with the last line opening on 27 October 1891. At its height the cable system was one of the largest in the world, with {{convert|75|km}} of double track, 1200 gripcars and trailers and 17 routes covering (103.2 route km or 64.12 route miles).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company Limited&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melbourne's cable trams&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railpage.org.au/tram/cable.html |title=Melbourne's cable trams |author=David Hoadley |date=8 January 1996 |work=Trams of Australia |accessdate=10 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121202914/http://www.railpage.org.au/tram/cable.html |archive-date=21 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 February 1890, the Northcote tramway was opened by the Clifton Hill to Northcote &amp; Preston Tramway Company. This was Melbourne's only non-MTOC cable tram, built by local land speculators and was operated as an independent line, feeding the Clifton Hill line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/northcote.htm  |title=Northcote: the on again, off again cable tramway |work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot |author=Russell Jones |year=2004 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lease expired on 1 July 1916, all the assets of the MTT and MTOC cable network were taken over by the Melbourne Tramways Board (MTB).&lt;ref name=&quot;Francis Boardman Clapp: transport entrepreneur&quot;/&gt; The MMTB was formed on 1 November 1919, taking over the MTB cable tram network, with the Northcote tramway and the tramway trusts transferred to the MMTB on 20 February 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;YT-Trams in Melbourne&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yarratrams.com.au/about-us/our-history/trams-in-melbourne/ | work=[[Yarra Trams]] | title=Trams in Melbourne | accessdate=26 January 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927162949/http://www.yarratrams.com.au/about-us/our-history/trams-in-melbourne/ | archive-date=27 September 2016 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The early days&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yarratrams.com.au/about-us/our-history/tramway-milestones/the-early-days/ | work=[[Yarra Trams]] | title=The early days | accessdate=26 January 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318134537/http://www.yarratrams.com.au/about-us/our-history/tramway-milestones/the-early-days/ | archive-date=18 March 2012 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1924 the cable tram lines were progressively converted to electric trams, or abandoned in favour of buses, with the last Melbourne cable tram operating on 26 October 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;YT-Trams in Melbourne&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://corp.ptv.vic.gov.au/managing-victoria-s-public-transport-network/history-and-heritage/early-history-of-public-transport/ | work=[[Public Transport Victoria]] | title=Early history of public transport | accessdate=9 July 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807063057/http://corp.ptv.vic.gov.au/managing-victoria-s-public-transport-network/history-and-heritage/early-history-of-public-transport/ | archive-date=7 August 2012 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First electric trams===
[[File:Box Hill to Doncaster tram.jpg|thumb|left|[[Box Hill, Victoria|Box Hill]] to [[Doncaster, Victoria|Doncaster]] tram]]
The first electric tram in Melbourne was built in 1889 by the Box Hill and Doncaster Tramway Company Limited—an enterprise formed by a group of land developers—and ran from [[Box Hill railway station, Melbourne|Box Hill railway station]] along what is now Station Street and Tram Road to [[Doncaster, Victoria|Doncaster]], using equipment left over from the Centennial International Exhibition of 1888 at the [[Royal Exhibition Building]]. The venture was marred with disputes and operational problems, and ultimately failed, with the service ceasing in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/boxhill.htm |title=Australia's first electric tram: the Box Hill to Doncaster tramway |author=Robert Green |date=October 1989 |work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this venture failed, electric trams returned on 5 May 1906, with the opening of the [[Victorian Railways#Other functions|Victorian Railways Electric Street Railway]] from [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] to [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], and was followed on 11 October 1906 with the opening of the [[List of defunct utility companies in Victoria, Australia#The North Melbourne Electric Tramways and Lighting Company|North Melbourne Electric Tramway &amp; Lighting Company]] (NMETL) system, which opened two lines from the cable tram terminus at Flemington Bridge to [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]] and Saltwater River (now [[Maribyrnong River]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;The early days&quot;/&gt;

====Victorian Railways Electric Street Railways====
[[File:Two Victorian Railway trams.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Victorian Railways]] trams]]
The [[Victorian Railways]] line came about when [[Thomas Bent|Sir Thomas Bent]] became [[Premier of Victoria|Premier]]. A corrupt politician and leading land boomer, he stood to benefit from construction of the line, through the increased value of his large land holdings in the area, and pushed through the legislation to enable to building of the line by the VR in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/bent.htm |title=Bent by name, Bent by nature |author=Russell Jones |year=2003 |work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VR tram was called a &quot;Street Railway&quot; and was built using the Victorian Railways {{Track gauge|5ft3in}} [[broad gauge]] instead of the cable tramway [[standard gauge]] of {{Track gauge|impsg}}, and connected it with the [[St Kilda railway station]], which would allow trams to be moved along the St Kilda railway line for servicing at [[Jolimont Yard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VR electric street railways&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/vrtram.htm |title=VR electric street railways  |author=Russell Jones |year=2003 |work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line was opened in two stages, from St Kilda railway station to Middle Brighton on 5 May 1906 and to Brighton Beach terminus on 22 December 1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;The early days&quot;/&gt;

A fire at the Elwood tram depot on 7 March 1907 destroyed the depot and all the trams. Services resumed on 17 March 1907 using four [[Sydney C-Class Tram|C-class trams]] and three [[Sydney D-Class Tram|D-class trams]] from [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney]], which were altered to run on VR trucks salvaged from the fire. These trams sufficed until [[Newport Workshops]] built 14 new trams. The St Kilda to Brighton Beach Electric Street Railway closed on 28 February 1959 and was replaced by buses.&lt;ref name=&quot;VR electric street railways&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tramway.org.au/reflections.php?p=vr_tramway_reminisences |title=V.R.

VR opened a second, standard gauge, electric tramway from [[Sandringham railway station]] to [[Black Rock, Victoria|Black Rock]] on 10 March 1919, it was extended to [[Beaumaris, Victoria|Beaumaris]] on 2 September 1926. The service was withdrawn on 5 November 1956 and replaced with buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tramway.org.au/reflections.php?p=the_sandringham_tramway |title=The Sandringham Tramway |author=Arthur Stone |date=October–November 1969 |work=[[Tramway Museum Society of Victoria|TMSV]] Running Journal |accessdate=3 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706130417/http://www.tramway.org.au/reflections.php?p=the_sandringham_tramway |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://localhistory.kingston.vic.gov.au/htm/article/237.htm |work=[[City of Kingston]] |title=Did You Know?: Trams | accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of defunct utility companies in Victoria, Australia#The North Melbourne Electric Tramways and Lighting Company|North Melbourne Electric Tramway &amp; Lighting Company]] (NMETL) was an electricity and tramway company that operated from 1906 to 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;A brief history of the North Melbourne Electric Tramway &amp; Lighting Company &quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/nmetl.htm |title=A brief history of the North Melbourne Electric Tramway &amp; Lighting Company  |author= Russell Jones |year=2005 |work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tramway section was taken over by the MMTB on 1 August 1922 and the electricity section taken over by the [[State Electricity Commission of Victoria]] in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;Between the Wars&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yarratrams.com.au/about-us/our-history/tramway-milestones/between-the-wars/ |work=[[Yarra Trams]] |title=Between the Wars |accessdate=26 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102235108/http://www.yarratrams.com.au/about-us/our-history/tramway-milestones/between-the-wars/ |archive-date=2 November 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.access.prov.vic.gov.au/public/component/daPublicBaseContainer?component=daViewAgency&amp;entityId=1002# |work=[[Public Record Office Victoria]] |title=State Electricity Commission of Victoria (previously known as the Electricity Commissioners) |accessdate=4 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006194727/http://www.access.prov.vic.gov.au/public/component/daPublicBaseContainer?component=daViewAgency&amp;entityId=1002 |archivedate=6 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victorian Government of Sir Thomas Bent approved an application by Mr Morgan to build a tramway system in the Essendon area on 29 March 1904, with a poll of ratepayers overwhelming supporting the proposition on 29 July 1904 (2874 votes to 146). Mr Morgan transferred the concession to the NMETL, which had been formed to build the system and provide electricity to the area. Under the concession the NMETL was to construct a tramway and provide electricity within the municipalities of Essendon and Flemington for 30 years, it also mandated a service at least every 20 minutes and had provisions for the undertaking to become property of the municipalities involved earlier than the prescribed 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Brief History of...

The NMETL bought land on [[Mount Alexander Road]] for its offices, car barn and power house, with the foundation stone laid by the Mayors of Essendon and Flemington on 24 May 1905, and the first rail laid a month later by Premier Bent. The system opened on 11 October 1906 operating two routes from Flemington Bridge—one to Essendon via Mount Alexander Road, [[Pascoe Vale Road]], Fletcher Street and onto Mount Alexander Road again (with a short branch line along Puckle Street), and the second to Saltwater River via Mount Alexander Road, Victoria Street, Racecourse Road, Epsom Road, Union Road and Maribyrnong Road. The system was approximately {{convert|7|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} and was operated by 25 motor cars and 10 trailers.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Brief History of...

===The tramway trusts===

Due to demand for better public transport in Melbourne's inner suburbs of Prahran and Malvern the [[Prahran &amp; Malvern Tramways Trust]] Act 1907 was enacted. Councillor [[Alexander Cameron (tramways administrator)|Alex Cameron]] of Malvern, who led the push for a municipal tramway service, was elected chairman of the trust by both Malvern and Prahran councils. Construction began on its first tram line in 1909 with the first passenger service commencing on 30 May 1910. Using overhead wires to feed electricity to the trams, the network continued to expand greatly and profitably.&lt;ref name=mmtb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/pmtt.htm |title=Steady as she goes: the Prahran &amp; Malvern Tramways Trust |author= Russell Jones |year=2008 |work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alex Cameron: father of Melbourne's electric trams&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/cameron.htm |title=Alex Cameron: father of Melbourne's electric trams |author= Russell Jones |year=2009 |work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the region covered by the PMTT was extended and, thus, representatives of the [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] and [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]] councils were also included on the board. In 1916 [[Camberwell, Victoria|Camberwell]] council representatives were also included.

Following the PMTT, the following municipal trusts were formed:
*[[Hawthorn Tramways Trust]] – 1914 (Municipalities of [[City of Melbourne|Melbourne]], [[City of Richmond|Richmond]], [[City of Camberwell|Camberwell]] &amp; [[City of Hawthorn|Hawthorn]])
*[[Melbourne, Brunswick &amp; Coburg Tramways Trust]] – 1916 (Municipalities of [[City of Brunswick|Brunswick]], [[City of Coburg|Coburg]] &amp; [[City of Melbourne|Melbourne]])
*[[Fitzroy, Northcote &amp; Preston Tramways Trust]] – in process of construction when taken over in 1920 (Municipalities of [[City of Fitzroy|Fitzroy]], [[City of Northcote|Northcote]] &amp; [[City of Preston (Victoria)|Preston]])
*Footscray Tramway Trust – in process of construction when taken over in 1920  (Municipality of [[City of Footscray|Footscray]])

===Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board===

The Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) was formed in July 1919 to take control of Melbourne's cable tram network, six of the seven electric tramway companies, and the last horse tram. By 1940, all cable and horse tram lines had been abandoned or converted to either electric tram or bus operation.

Alex Cameron was its full-time chairman.&lt;ref name=mmtb/&gt; The tramway network had both cable and electric traction and had been constructed by different bodies without any uniform system. Under Cameron, the MMTB brought these systems under its control, extending the electric lines, and converting the existing cable-system to electric traction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alex Cameron: father of Melbourne's electric trams&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070534b.htm |title=Cameron, Alexander (1864–1940) |author=Kathleen Thomson |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To solve operational and maintenance problem the MMTB introduced in 1923 the iconic [[W-class Melbourne tram|W-class tram]] and phased out the other models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board W Class No 380&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/trams/mmtb380.htm |work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot |title=Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board W Class No 380 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Preston Workshops]] were constructed about this time to manufacture and maintain the new tram fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vines2011&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/heritage/publications-and-research/thematic-and-typological-studies/tram-heritage-study |title=Vines, G. 2010 ''Melbourne Tramway Heritage Study'', report to Heritage Victoria |access-date=8 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501135113/http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/heritage/publications-and-research/thematic-and-typological-studies/tram-heritage-study |archive-date=1 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1923 Alex Cameron went overseas to investigate traffic problems. He returned next year confirmed in his long-held opinions that electric trams were superior to buses and that overhead wires were preferable to the underground conduit (cable) system. Alex Cameron remained chairman there until 1935. He died a few years later in 1940, the same year the last of the cable tram services in Melbourne ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alex Cameron: father of Melbourne's electric trams&quot;/&gt;

The MMTB generated further patronage by developing the enormous [[Wattle Park, Melbourne|Wattle Park]] in the 1920s and 1930s, it had inherited Wattle Park from the Hawthorn Tramways Trust with the HTTs takeover by the MMTB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/wattlepk.htm |title=Wattle Park: a tramway tradition |author=Russell Jones |year=2003 |work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II other Australian cities began to replace their trams with buses. However, in Melbourne, the Bourke Street buses were replaced by trams in 1955, and new lines opened to [[Preston, Victoria|East Preston]] and [[Brunswick East]].

Melbourne's tram usage peaked at 260 million trips in 1949, before dropping sharply to 200 million the following year in 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;TDIA&quot;&gt;Transport Demand Information Atlas, Vol 1&lt;/ref&gt; However usage defied the trend and bounced back in 1951, but began a gradual decline in usage which would continue until 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;TDIA&quot; /&gt; During the same period bus use also went into decline and buses have never proved as popular with passengers as trams at any time in Melbourne's history.

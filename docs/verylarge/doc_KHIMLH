Repeal and replacement of Obamacare (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) was a centerpiece of McCain's 2016 re-election campaign, and in July 2017 he said, &quot;Have no doubt: Congress must replace Obamacare, which has hit Arizonans with some of the highest premium increases in the nation and left 14 of Arizona's 15 counties with only one provider option on the exchanges this year.&quot; He added that he supports affordable and quality health care, but objected that the pending Senate bill did not do enough to shield the [[Medicaid]] system in Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;Nowicki, Dan.

In response to the death of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]], who died of organ failure while in government custody, McCain said that &quot;this is only the latest example of Communist China's assault on human rights, democracy, and freedom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump praises Xi soon after death of Chinese dissident |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/13/trump-praises-xi-soon-after-death-of-chinese-dissident.html |publisher=CNBC |date=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, McCain praised President Trump's decision to decertify Iran's compliance with the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) while not yet withdrawing the U.S. from the agreement, saying that the Obama-era policy failed &quot;to meet the multifaceted threat Iran poses.

At the [[70th Primetime Emmy Awards]], McCain was recognized in the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment, right before [[Aretha Franklin]].

The non-partisan ''[[National Journal]]'' rates a Senator's votes by what percentage of the Senate voted more liberally than him or her, and what percentage more conservatively, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006 (as reported in the 2008 ''[[Almanac of American Politics]]''), McCain's average ratings were as follows: economic policy: 59&amp;nbsp;percent conservative and 41&amp;nbsp;percent liberal; social policy: 54&amp;nbsp;percent conservative and 38&amp;nbsp;percent liberal; and foreign policy: 56&amp;nbsp;percent conservative and 43&amp;nbsp;percent liberal.&lt;ref name=&quot;aap-08&quot;&gt;[[Michael Barone (pundit)|Barone, Michael]] and [[Richard E.

Columnists such as Robert Robb and [[Matthew Continetti]] used a formulation devised by [[William F.

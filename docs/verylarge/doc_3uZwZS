[[File:QE2 bow 15 October 2008.jpg|thumb|''QE2'' bow name, October 2008]]
The name of the liner as it appears on the bow and stern is ''Queen Elizabeth 2'', with upper- and lower-case lettering and an [[Arabic numeral]] 2 as opposed to the [[Roman numeral]] II distinguishing her from the monarch; it is commonly pronounced in speech as ''Queen Elizabeth Two''.&lt;ref name=&quot;UGArchiveShip736&quot;&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after launching, the name was shortened in common use as ''QE2''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShipsandCruiseQE2Birthday&quot;/&gt;

===Background===
''Queen Mary'', in 1934, and ''Queen Elizabeth'', in 1938, were both named by and for contemporary spouses of reigning monarchs: [[Mary of Teck]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirror10Nov08lastvoyage&quot;/&gt; These two previous Cunarders both had capitalised bow names, as ''QUEEN MARY'' and ''QUEEN ELIZABETH''.

Cunard practice at the time of naming ''QE2'' was to re-use the existing name of [[Cunard Line#Former ships|its former ships]], for example, launching the {{RMS|Mauretania|1938|2}} in 1938 after the previous {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}} was scrapped in 1935.

The original ''Queen Elizabeth'' was still in service with Cunard when ''QE2'' was launched in 1967, although she was retired and sold before ''QE2'' entered revenue service with Cunard in 1969.

The addition of a &quot;2&quot; in this manner was unknown at the time, but it was not unknown for Roman numerals to denote ships in service with the same name. Two non-Cunard ships were named ''Queen Mary II'': a Clyde steamer, and ''Mauretania II'', a Southampton steamer of Red Funnel, since the Cunard ships already had the names without Roman numerals.

===Launch===
As was Cunard practice at the time, the name of the liner was not to be publicly revealed until the launch.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatOceanLinersQE2page&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; various explanations of events occur.

These state that, as at the launch ceremony, an envelope and card were also held in New York in case of transmission failure, and when opened the card was found to read the name Queen Elizabeth, and that the decision to add &quot;The Second&quot; to the name was an alteration by the Queen. The book quotes the Cunard chairman [[Sir Basil Smallpeice]]&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE SPELLING! SMALLPEICE IS CORRECT--&gt; as saying &quot;The ''Queen Mary'' [named] after her Grandmother, the ''Queen Elizabeth'' after her mother, and now this magnificent ship after herself.&quot;

Following the unexpected addition of ''the Second'' by the Queen, the book attributes the use of upper and lower case lettering and a numeric ''2''&amp;nbsp;– rather than a [[Roman numerals|Roman]] ''II''&amp;nbsp;– to the decision by Cunard to use a more modern typeface to suit the style of the 1960s. The book also surmises that the naming of the liner after the reigning monarch, in the form Queen Elizabeth II, was potentially offensive to some Scots, as the title of Queen Elizabeth II (of the United Kingdom) relates to the lineage of the throne of England (the Tudor monarch [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] having reigned only in England).

===Ron Warwick, former captain===
In a later account by Ronald Warwick, who was the son of William &quot;Bil&quot; Warwick and the first master of ''QE2'', Warwick junior (himself later in his Cunard career a [[Captain (nautical)|master]] of the ''QE2'' and latterly the first captain of ''[[RMS Queen Mary 2|QM2]]'') supports the account that the Queen initiated the surprise move of naming the liner after herself rather than simply Queen Elizabeth as had originally been planned (the name having been made vacant by the retirement of the current liner before the new one was commissioned).&lt;ref name=&quot;RonaldWarwick3rdEditionp60&quot;&gt;Warwick junior is currently involved with ''QE2'' in Dubai and Cape Town on behalf of Nakheel.

 |quote = There was no question what Sir Basil and the Cunard board desired. The name was discussed with Lord Adeane, the queen's private secretary, and it was decided simply to ask that the new ship be named Queen Elizabeth, because by the time of her commissioning, both of the earlier Queens would be withdrawn from service and she could assume the name vacated by one of her predecessors ... Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II moved to the front of the launching platform and was handed an envelope by John Rannie with the name of the ship inside. This was a tradition because many years before someone purportedly had forgotten the name of a ship about to be launched. The envelope remained unopened as the queen stepped forward and uttered the words, &quot;I name this ship the Queen Elizabeth the Second. May God Bless her and all who sail in her&quot; ... Sir Basil {{sic|hide=y|Smallpeice}}&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE SPELLING! SMALLPEICE IS CORRECT--&gt; was overjoyed at the sovereign's alteration of the name. (paragraph reference his autobiography {{ISBN|0-906393-10-8}}) He could not have been more delighted with having the third of the great royal Cunarders named in this manner. The decision promptly was made to style the giant liner ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' using the numeral two to differentiate the ship from the sovereign.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The name had been given to the Queen in a sealed envelope which she didn't open. The book, referencing his autobiography, states that the Cunard chairman Sir Basil {{sic|hide=y|Smallpeice}}&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE SPELLING! SMALLPEICE IS CORRECT--&gt; was delighted with this development, it being in keeping with the previous Queen liners, and the 2 was added by Cunard for differentiation of the ship while still denoting it was named after the Queen.

===Cunard website===
From at least 2002 the official Cunard website stated that &quot;The new ship is not named after the Queen but is simply the second ship to bear the name&amp;nbsp;– hence the use of the Arabic 2 in her name, rather than the Roman II used by the Queen&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;CunardWebsiteQE2First30YearsArchive16June2002&quot;&gt;

[[File:Sopwith Camel - Season Premiere Airshow 2018 (42058141172).jpg|thumb|[[First World War]] [[Sopwith Camel]] biplane]]
A '''biplane''' is a [[fixed-wing aircraft]] with two main [[wing]]s stacked one above the other. The first powered, controlled [[aeroplane]] to fly, the [[Wright Flyer]], used a biplane wing arrangement, as did many aircraft in the early years of [[aviation]]. While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane, it produces more [[drag (aerodynamics)|drag]] than a [[monoplane]] wing. Improved structural techniques, better materials and higher speeds made the biplane configuration obsolete for most purposes by the late 1930s.

Biplanes offer several advantages over conventional [[cantilever]] monoplane designs: they permit lighter wing structures, low wing loading and smaller span for a given wing area. However, interference between the airflow over each wing increases drag substantially, and biplanes generally need extensive bracing, which causes additional drag.

Biplanes are distinguished from [[tandem wing]] arrangements, where the wings are placed forward and aft, instead of above and below.

The term is also occasionally used in [[biology]], to describe the [[wing]]s of some [[Flying and gliding animals|flying animals]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Hang Glider 1920s.jpg|thumb|1920s biplane hang glider]]
In a biplane aircraft, two wings are placed one above the other. Each provides part of the lift, although they are not able to produce twice as much lift as a single wing of similar size and shape because the upper and the lower are working on nearly the same portion of the atmosphere and thus interfere with each other's behaviour. For example, in a wing of [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] 6, and a wing separation distance of one [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] length, the biplane configuration will only produce about 20 percent more lift than a single wing of the same [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]].&lt;ref name=Dommasch&gt;Dommasch, 1961, p.?&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower wing is usually attached to the [[fuselage]], while the upper wing is raised above the fuselage with an arrangement of [[cabane strut]]s, although other arrangements have been used. Either or both of the main wings can support [[aileron]]s, while flaps are more usually positioned on the lower wing. Bracing is nearly always added between the upper and lower wings, in the form of [[interplane strut]]s positioned symmetrically on either side of the fuselage and bracing wires to keep the structure from flexing, where the wings are not themselves [[cantilever]] structures.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
[[File:Antonov an2 ha-mkf arp.jpg|thumb|Soviet [[Antonov An-2]] biplane from the 1940s]]
The primary advantage of the biplane over a [[monoplane]] is its ability to combine greater stiffness with lower weight. Stiffness requires structural depth and where early monoplanes had to have this provided with external bracing, the biplane naturally has a deep structure and is therefore easier to make both light and strong. Rigging wires on non-cantilevered monoplanes are at a much sharper angle, thus providing less tension to ensure stiffness of the outer wing. On a biplane, since the angles are closer to the ideal of being in direct line with the forces being opposed, the overall structure can then be made stiffer. Because of the reduced stiffness, wire braced monoplanes often had multiple sets of flying and landing wires where a biplane could easily be built with one bay, with one set of landing and flying wires. The extra drag from the wires was not enough to offset the aerodynamic disadvantages from having two airfoils interfering with each other however. Strut braced monoplanes were tried but none of them were successful, not least due to the drag from the number of struts used.

The structural forces acting on the spars of a biplane wing tend to be lower as they are divided between four spars rather than two, so the wing can use less material to obtain the same overall strength and is therefore lighter. A given area of wing also tends to be shorter, reducing bending moments on the spars, which then allow them to be more lightly built as well.&lt;ref&gt;Berriman, 1913, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; The biplane does however need extra struts to maintain the gap between the wings, which add both weight and drag. 

The low power supplied by the engines available in the first years of aviation limited aeroplanes to fairly low speeds. This required an even lower [[Stall (fluid dynamics)|stalling]] speed, which in turn required a low [[wing loading]], combining both large wing area with light weight. Obtaining a large enough wing area without the wings being long, and thus dangerously flexible was more readily accomplished with a biplane.

The smaller biplane wing allows greater [[Aerobatics|maneuverability]]. Following World War One, this helped extend the era of the biplane and, despite the performance disadvantages, military aircraft were among the last to abandon biplanes. Specialist sports [[aerobatics|aerobatic]] biplanes are still made in small numbers.

Biplanes suffer aerodynamic interference between the two planes when the high pressure air under the top wing and the low pressure air above the lower wing cancel each other out. This means that a biplane does not in practice obtain twice the lift of the similarly-sized monoplane. The farther apart the wings are spaced the less the interference, but the spacing struts must be longer, and the gap must be extremely large to reduce it appreciably. Given the low speed and power of early aircraft, the drag penalty of the wires and struts and the mutual interference of airflows were relatively minor and acceptable factors. 

As engine power and speeds rose late in [[World War One]], thick cantilever wings with inherently lower drag and higher wing loading became practical, which in turn made monoplanes more attractive as it helped solve the structural problems associated with monoplanes, but offered little improvement for biplanes.

=== Stagger ===
[[File:Fleet 16B (C-FPFF).jpg|thumb|Wing stagger on a [[Fleet Finch]] primary trainer]]
The default design for a biplane has the wings positioned directly one above the other. Moving the upper wing forward relative to the lower one is called [[Stagger (aviation)|positive stagger]] or, more often, simply stagger. It can increase lift and reduce drag by reducing the aerodynamic interference effects between the two wings by a small degree, but more often was used to improve access to the cockpit. Many biplanes have staggered wings. Common examples include the [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]], [[Bücker Bü 131|Bücker Bü 131 Jungmann]] and [[Travel Air 2000]].

Alternatively, the lower wing can instead be moved ahead of the upper wing, giving negative stagger, and similar benefits. This is usually done in a given design for structural reasons, or to improve visibility. Examples of negative stagger include the [[Sopwith Dolphin]], [[Breguet 14]] and [[Beechcraft Staggerwing]]. However, positive (forward) stagger is much more common.

=== Bays ===
The space enclosed by a set of [[interplane strut]]s is called a ''bay'' (much as [[Bay (architecture)|the architectural form]] is used), hence a biplane or triplane with one set of such struts connecting the wings on each side of the aircraft is a ''single-bay biplane''. 
This provided sufficient strength for smaller aircraft such as the [[First World War]]-era [[Fokker D.VII]] fighter and the [[Second World War]] [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]] basic trainer.

The larger two-seat [[Curtiss JN-4]] Jenny is a ''two bay biplane'', the extra bay being necessary as overlong bays are prone to flexing and can fail. The [[SPAD S.XIII]] fighter, while appearing to be a two bay biplane, has only one bay, but has the midpoints of the rigging braced with additional struts; however, these are not structurally contiguous from top to bottom wing. The [[Sopwith 1½ Strutter]] has a W shape cabane, however as it does not connect the wings to each other, it does not add to the number of bays.

Large transport and [[Bomber|bombing]] biplanes often needed still more bays to provide sufficient strength. These are sometimes referred to as ''multi-bay biplanes''. A small number of biplanes, such as the [[Zeppelin-Lindau D.I]] have no interplane struts and are referred to as being ''strutless''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Rigging ===
{{main|Bracing (aeronautics)#Rigging}}
Because most biplanes do not have [[cantilever]] structures, they require rigging wires to maintain their rigidity. Early aircraft used simple wire (either braided or plain), however during the First World War, the British [[Royal Aircraft Factory]] developed airfoil section wire named RAFwire in an effort to both increase the strength and reduce the drag. 
Four types of wires are used in the biplane wing structure. Drag wires inside the wings prevent the wings from being folded back against the fuselage, running inside a wing bay from the forward inboard corner to the rear outboard corner.&lt;ref name=GunstonP210&gt;Gunston, 2004, p.210&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-drag wires prevent the wings from moving forward when the aircraft stops and run the opposite direction to the drag wires.&lt;ref name=GunstonP51&gt;Gunston, 2004, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are usually hidden within the wings, and if the structure is sufficiently stiff otherwise, may be omitted in some designs. Indeed many early aircraft relied on the fabric covering of the wing to provide this rigidity, until higher speeds and forces made this inadequate. 
Externally, lift wires prevent the wings from folding up, and run from the underside of the outer wing to the lower wing root.&lt;ref name=GunstonP382&gt;Gunston, 2004, p.382&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, landing wires prevent the wings from sagging, and resist the forces when an aircraft is landing, and run from the upper wing centre section to outboard on the lower wings.&lt;ref name=GunstonP375&gt;Gunston, 2004, p.375&lt;/ref&gt; Additional drag and anti-drag wires may be used to brace the cabane struts which connect the fuselage to the wings, and interplane struts, which connect the upper and lower wings together.

===Sesquiplane===
[[File:Early Nieuport 17 climbing (cropped).jpg|thumb|The much smaller lower wing is apparent in this photo of a [[Nieuport 17]]]]
The '''sesquiplane''' is a type of  biplane where one wing (usually the lower) is significantly smaller than the other.&lt;ref&gt;Wragg, 1974, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunston&gt;Gunston, 2009, p.606&lt;/ref&gt; The word literally means &quot;one-and-a-half wings.&quot; The arrangement can reduce [[Drag (physics)#Aerodynamics|drag]] and weight while retaining the biplane's structural advantages. Typically one wing has a significantly shorter span, although some designs keep the upper and lower spans nearly equal while reducing the lower [[chord (aircraft)|chord]]. Examples include the series of [[Nieuport]] military aircraft — from the [[Nieuport 10]] through to the [[Nieuport 27]] which formed the backbone of the Allied air forces from 1915 until 1917, and which were widely copied. The [[Albatros D.III]] and [[Albatros D.V|D.V]], which copied the general layout from Nieuport similarly provided the backbone of the German forces.
Between the wars in Europe, the [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 42]]/[[Nieuport-Delage NiD 52|52]]/[[Nieuport-Delage NiD 62|62]] series, [[Fokker C.V]]d &amp; e, and [[Potez 25]] sesquiplanes served in many air forces, while the [[Waco Custom Cabin series]] proved to be a popular general aviation aircraft. The [[Saro Windhover]] was a sesquiplane with the upper wing smaller than the lower, a much rarer configuration than the reverse.

Stacking of wing planes was suggested by [[Sir George Cayley]] in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. D. Ackroyd; &quot;Sir George Cayley: The Invention of the Aeroplane near Scarborough at the Time of Trafalgar&quot;, Journal of Aeronautical History, Paper No. 2011/6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hiram Maxim]] adopted the idea for his steam-powered test rig, which lifted off but was held down by safety rails, in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Wragg, p.206&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Lilienthal]] designed and flew two different biplane [[hang glider]]s in 1895,&lt;ref&gt; Schwipps, Werner. ''Die Flugzeuge von Otto Lilienthal.  Technik - Dokumentation - Rekonstruktion. (The airplanes of Otto Lilienthal. Technique - Documentation - Reconstruction)''. Otto-Lilienthal-Museum Anklam, 2016. {{ISBN|978-3-941681-88-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; though he is better known for his monoplanes.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;[http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/ewright.htm &quot;From Lilienthal to the Wrights.&quot;] ''Otto Lilienthal Museum.''  Retrieved: 8 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1896 a group of young men in the United States, led by [[Octave Chanute]], were flying [[hang glider]]s including biplanes and concluded that the externally braced biplane offered better prospects for powered flight than the monoplane. The ''[[Wright Flyer]]'' biplane of 1903 became the first successful powered aeroplane.

Throughout the pioneer years, both biplanes and monoplanes were common, but by the outbreak of the [[First World War]] biplanes had gained favour after several monoplane structural failures resulted in the [[Royal Flying Corps|RFC's]] &quot;Monoplane Ban&quot; when all monoplanes in military service were grounded, while the French also withdrew most monoplanes from combat roles and relegated them to training.
During the period from 1914 to 1925 most new aircraft were biplanes but from 1917, the Germans began experimenting with a new generation of monoplanes such as the [[Fokker D.VIII]] that might have ended the biplane's advantages earlier had the war not ended when it had. The French meanwhile had the [[Morane-Saulnier AI]] strut braced [[parasol monoplane]] in service. [[Sesquiplane]] types, which were biplanes with abbreviated lower wings such as the French [[Nieuport 17]] and German [[Albatros D.III]], offered lower drag than a conventional biplane while being stronger than a monoplane.
 
As the available engine-power and speed increased, the drag penalty of external bracing increasingly limited aircraft performance. To fly faster, it would be necessary to reduce external bracing to create an aerodynamically clean design. Early cantilever designs were too weak or too heavy. The 1917 [[Junkers J.I]] sesquiplane utilized [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] aluminum for all flying surfaces, with a minimum of struts, but it was slow. The 1918 [[Zeppelin-Lindau D.I]] fighter was an all-metal stressed-skin [[monocoque]] fully cantilevered biplane but was too late to enter service.

By the 1930s biplanes had reached their performance limits, and monoplanes become increasingly predominant, particularly in continental Europe where monoplanes had been increasingly common from the end of [[World War I]]. At the start of [[World War II]], several air forces still had biplane combat aircraft in front line service but they were no longer competitive, and most were used in niche roles, such as training or shipboard operation, until shortly after the end of the war. The British [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplane, the Italian [[Fiat CR.42]] and Soviet [[I-153]] sesquiplane fighters were all still operational after 1939.&lt;ref name=Coggins&gt;Coggins, 2000, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_polikarpov_I-153.html Polikarpov I-153 Chaika (Seagull)]&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Heinkel He 50]] and the Soviet [[Polikarpov Po-2]] were both used in the night [[ground attack]] role throughout  the Second World War, with the latter soldiering on until the [[Korean War]]. 
[[File:stearman.e75.g-bswc.longshot.arp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing-Stearman Model 75]] PT-13D biplane trainer from the 30s and 40s]]
The British [[Fleet Air Arm]] flew [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from its aircraft carriers in the [[anti-submarine warfare]] role until the end of the war because they could operate from the decks of small [[escort carrier]]s. 

Later biplane [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]]s included the [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]] in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] and others and the [[Stampe SV.4]], which saw service postwar in the French and Belgian Air Forces. The [[Stearman PT-13]] was widely used by the [[USAAF]] and the US Navy operated the [[Naval Aircraft Factory N3N]]. In later civilian use in the US, the Stearman became particularly associated with stunt flying such as [[wing-walking]], and with crop dusting, where its compactness worked well at low levels, where it had to dodge obstacles.

[[File:Flight Po-2 RA-1945g (4723729033).jpg|thumb|[[Polikarpov Po-2]], of which over 20,000 were built by the Soviet Union]]
Modern biplane designs still exist in specialist roles such as [[aerobatics]] and [[agricultural aircraft]] with the competition aerobatics role and format for such a biplane well-defined by the mid-1930s by the [[Udet U 12 Flamingo]] and [[Waco Taperwing]]. The [[Pitts Special]] dominated aerobatics for many years after World War II and is still in production.

The vast majority of biplane designs have been fitted with [[reciprocating engine]]s. Exceptions include the [[Antonov An-3]] and [[WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor]], fitted with [[turboprop]] and [[turbofan]] engines respectively. Some older biplane designs, such as the [[Grumman Ag Cat]] are available in upgraded versions with turboprop engines.

The two most produced biplane designs were the 1913 British [[Avro 504]] of which 11,303 were built, and the 1928 Soviet [[Polikarpov Po-2]] of which over 20,000 were built, with the Po-2 being the direct replacement for the Soviet copy of the Avro 504. Both were widely used as trainers.

Trento was awarded the title of [[Alpine Town of the Year]] 2004.

The city often ranks highly among Italian cities for [[quality of life]], [[standard of living]], and [[business opportunity|business and job opportunities]], being ranked 5th in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/speciali/qvita_2017_dati/home.shtml |title=Qualità della vita |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |accessdate=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trento is also one of the nation's wealthiest and most prosperous cities, with its [[Trentino|province]] being one of the richest in Italy, with a [[GDP per capita]] of €31,200 and a [[GDP]] (nominal) of €16.563&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STAT-14-29_en.pdf GDP per capita in the EU in 2011: seven capital regions among the ten most prosperous]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
The township of Trento encompasses the city centre as well as many suburbs of extremely varied geographical and population conditions (from the industrial suburb of Gardolo, just north of the city, to tiny mountain hamlets on Monte Bondone). Various distinctive suburbs still retain their traditional identity of rural or mountain villages.

Trento lies in a wide [[glacial valley]] known as the [[Adige|Adige valley]], just south of the [[Dolomite Mountains]], where the Fersina River and [[Avisio River|Avisio]] rivers join the [[Adige|Adige River]] (the second longest river in Italy). River Adige is one of the three primary south-flowing Alpine rivers; its broadly curving course alongside Trento was straightened in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1940:215, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The valley is surrounded by mountains, including Vigolana ({{convert|2,150|m|ft|abbr=on}}), Monte Bondone ({{convert|2,181|m|ft|abbr=on}}), [[Paganella]] ({{convert|2,124|m|ft|abbr=on}}), Marzola ({{convert|1,747|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Monte Calisio]] ({{convert|1,096|m|ft|abbr=on}}). Nearby lakes include [[Lake Caldonazzo]], Lake Levico, [[Lake Garda]] and Lake Toblino.

The origins of this city on the river track to [[Bolzano]] and the low Alpine passes of [[Brenner Pass|Brenner]] and the [[Reschen Pass]]&lt;ref&gt;Griffith Taylor, &quot;Trento to the Reschen Pass: A Cultural Traverse of the Adige Corridor&quot;, ''Geographical Review'' '''30'''.2 (April 1940:215–237), &quot;The site and evolution of the town of Trento&quot;, pp 220-.&lt;/ref&gt; over the Alps are disputed. Some scholars maintain it was a [[Rhaetia]]n settlement: the Adige area was however influenced by neighbouring populations, including the [[Adriatic Veneti|(Adriatic) Veneti]], the [[Etruscans]] and the [[Gaul]]s (a [[Celt]]ic people). According to other theories, the latter did instead found the city during the 4th century BC.

Trento was conquered by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the 1st century BC, after several clashes with the Rhaetian tribes. Before the Romans, Trento was a Celtic village. [[Julius Caesar]] re-founded it as a Roman municipality when [[Lex Roscia|Rome extended citizenship]] to the part of Cisalpine Gaul north of the River Po.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cooley|first=Alison E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bChcCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA285|title=A Companion to Roman Italy|date=2016-01-05|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-99311-8|pages=285|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ando|first1=Clifford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4ElDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127|title=Ancient States and Infrastructural Power: Europe, Asia, and America|last2=Richardson|first2=Seth|date=2017-05-26|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-9417-0|pages=127|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the name derives from ''Trent'', which is a tribute to the Celtic god of the waters (because of the river Adige).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The Romans gave their settlement the name ''Tridentum'' and is a tribute to the Roman god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] (Tri Dentum, meaning 'Three Teeth' because of the three hills that surround the city: the ''Doss Trent'', ''Sant'Agata'' and ''San Rocco''). The Latin name is the source of the adjective &quot;tridentine&quot;. On the old city hall, a [[Latin]] inscription is still visible: &quot;''Montes argentum mihi dant nomenque Tridentum''&quot; (&quot;Mountains give me silver and the name of Trento&quot;), attributed to Fra' Bartolomeo da Trento (died in 1251). Tridentum became an important stop on the [[Roman road]] that led from [[Verona]] to [[Innsbruck]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1940:221.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the independent bishopric of Trento was conquered by [[Ostrogoths]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Lombards]] and [[Franks]], finally becoming part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1027, Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] created the [[Prince-Bishops of Trento]], who wielded both temporal and religious powers. In the following centuries, however, the sovereignty was divided between the [[Bishopric of Trent]] and the [[County of Tyrol]] (from 1363 part of the Habsburg monarchy). Around 1200, Trento became a mining center of some significance: silver was mined from the Monte Calisio – Khalisperg, and Prince-Bishop [[Federico Wanga]] issued the first mining code of the alpine region.

In the 14th century, the region of Trento was part of Austria. The dukes of [[Austria]] ([[Habsburg]] Family) were also the counts of [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and dominated the region for six centuries (1918).

A dark episode in the history of Trento was the Trento [[blood libel]]. When a 3-year-old Christian boy, Simonino, later known as [[Simon of Trent]], disappeared in 1475 on the eve of [[Good Friday]], the city's small Jewish community was accused of killing him and draining his blood for Jewish ritual purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;iht.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/04/arts/conway.php|publisher=iht.com|title=The New York Times – Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight Jews were tortured and burned at the stake, and their families forced to convert to Christianity. The bishop of Trento, Johannes Hinderbach, had Simonino canonized and published the first book printed in Trento, ''&quot;Story of a Christian Child Murdered at Trento&quot;'', embellished with 12 woodcuts.&lt;ref name=&quot;iht.com&quot;/&gt; In a governmental ceremony in the 1990s, Trento apologized to the Jewish community for this dark episode and unveiled a plaque commemorating the formal apology.

[[File:Council of Trent.JPG|thumb|right|[[Council of Trent]]]]
In the 16th century, Trento became notable for the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) which gave rise to the [[Counter-Reformation]]. The adjective ''Tridentine'' (as in &quot;Tridentine Mass&quot;) literally means pertaining to Trento, but can also refer to that specific event. Among the notable prince-bishops of this time were [[Bernardo Clesio]] (who governed the city from 1514 to 1539, and managed to steer the Council to Trento) and [[Cristoforo Madruzzo]] (who governed from 1539 to 1567), both able European politicians and Renaissance [[humanism|humanists]], who greatly expanded and embellished the city.

During this period, and as an expression of this Humanism, Trento was also known as the site of a [[Jewish]] printing press. In 1558 Cardinal Madruzzo granted the privilege of printing [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Rabbinic literature|books]] to Joseph Ottolengo, a German [[rabbi]]. The actual printer was [[Jacob Marcaria]], a local physician; after his death in 1562, the activity of the press of Riva di Trento ceased. Altogether, 34 works were published in the period from 1558 to 1562, most of them bearing the coat of arms of Madruzzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=314&amp;letter=R |title=Riva Di Trento |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince-bishops governed Trento until the Napoleonic era, when it changed hands among various states. Under the [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss|reorganization of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1802, the Bishopric was secularized and annexed to the [[Habsburg]] territories. The [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] in 1805 ceded Trento to [[Bavaria]], and the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] four years later gave it to Napoleon's [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]].

The population staged armed resistance to French domination. The resistance leader was [[Andreas Hofer]]. During his youth, he lived in Italian Tyrol, where he learned the [[Italian language]]. When Hofer recovered Trento for the Austrians (1809), he was welcomed with enthusiasm by the population of Trento. Approximately 4,000 Trentinian volunteers (''Sìzzeri'' or ''Schützen'') died in battle against the French and Bavarian troops. In 1810, Hofer was captured and brought to [[Mantua]], and was shot by French soldiers on the express order of Napoleon.

With Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Trento was again annexed by the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Empire]]. Church government was finally extinguished, and Trento was henceforth governed by the secular administration of [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]. In the following decades, Trento experienced a modernization of administration and economy with the first railroad in the Adige valley opening in 1859.  The entire Mediterranean basin was at risk of malaria, a factor that affected the entire Italian peninsula and this Alpine region was not spared. Even Tuscany was particularly hard hit; malaria existed far inland into the Veneto area, reaching the Italian Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 3340992 | pmid=22550561 | doi=10.4084/MJHID.2012.016 | volume=4 | title=Short history of malaria and its eradication in Italy with short notes on the fight against the infection in the mediterranean basin | year=2012 | journal=Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis | page=e2012016 | author=Majori, G| issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1918 to 1940, government figures show Italy's malaria deaths decreased by 96%, due to the efforts of the Rockefeller Foundation and Italy's own malaria experts, who themselves were international leaders in malariology.&lt;ref&gt;http://rockarch.org/publications/resrep/hall.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th century, Trento and [[Trieste]], cities with ethnic Italian majorities still belonging to the Austrians, became icons of the Italian [[irredentist]] movement. [[Benito Mussolini]] briefly joined the staff of a local newspaper in 1909, but left Trento because they could not create an anti-Austrian group. There was dissatisfaction with the lack of provincial autonomy and the failure to establish a university for the region. Feelings of loyalty were focused on the 'father-figure' emperor, not for Austria.  
[[File:Il Mausoleo di Cesare Battisti, a Trento.jpg|left|thumb|Mausoleum of [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]]]]
The nationalist cause led Italy into [[World War I]]. Damiano Chiesa and the deputy in the Austrian parliament [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]] were two well-known local irredentists who had joined the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]] to fight against Austria-Hungary with the aim of bringing the territory of Trento into the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. The two men were taken prisoners at the nearby southern front. They were put on trial for high treason and executed in the courtyard of [[Castello del Buonconsiglio]].

The region was greatly affected during the war, and some of its fiercest battles were fought on the surrounding mountains in the southernmost regions and the southeast. Of a population of just less than 400,000 in the province, 55,000 men served in the Imperial and Royal Army of whom 11,000 died. Most served on the Galician front; 700 served with the Italian Army. After [[World War I]], Trento and its Italian-speaking province, along with [[Bolzano]] (Bozen) and the part of Tyrol that stretched south of the Alpine watershed (which was primarily [[German language|German]]-speaking), were annexed by Italy.

In July 1943 Mussolini was removed as Prime Minister when the allies invaded Sicily. Italy surrendered to the Allies, and declared war on Germany. German troops promptly invaded northern Italy and the provinces of Trento, [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]] and [[South Tyrol]] became part of the [[Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills]], annexed to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Some German-speakers wanted revenge upon Italian-speakers living in the area, but were mostly prevented by the occupying German troops, who still considered Mussolini head of the [[Italian Social Republic]] and wanted to preserve good relations with the Italians. From November 1944 to April 1945, Trento was bombed as part of the so-called &quot;Battle of the Brenner&quot;. War supplies from Germany to support the [[Gothic Line]] were for the most part routed via the rail line through the Brenner Pass. Over 6,849 sorties were flown by the Allies over targets from [[Verona]] to the [[Brenner Pass]], with 10,267 tons of bombs dropped. Parts of the city were hit by the Allied bombings, including the church of S. Maria Maggiore, the Church of the Annunciation and several bridges over the [[Adige]] river. In spite of the bombings, most of the medieval and renaissance city center was spared. It was finally liberated on 3 May 1945.

In 1947, Trento became the host of the [[Rally Stella Alpina]].

Since the 1950s, the region has enjoyed prosperous growth, thanks in part to its special autonomy from the central Italian government.

On 4 August 2015, the cathedral tower caught fire by &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot;. The clock stopped at 10:50 AM, a matter of minutes after the fire began.

In 2020, Trento was listed as the most sustainable city in Italy, according to the Smart City Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smartgreenpost.com/2020/03/03/smart-city-index-2020-trento-is-the-most-sustainable-city-in-italy/|title=Smart City Index 2020, Trento is the most sustainable city in Italy {{!}} SmartGreen Post {{!}} news from the environment|last=Vincenti|first=Piera|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
[[File:Pergola trentino.JPG|thumb|left|Vineyard in Trento]]The city owes much of its unique economy to its position along the main communication route between Italy and Northern Europe and to the Adige river which, prior to its diversion in the mid-19th century, ran through the center of the city. The Adige river was formerly a navigable river and one of the main commercial routes in the Alps. The original course of the river is now covered by the Via Torre Vanga, Via Torre Verde and the Via Alessandro Manzoni.

===Economy Festival Trento===
The Economy Festival (Festival dell’Economia di Trento) was brought into being in 2006 in order to enable and facilitate discussions between economists and a broad public. The aim of this festival is to put economic terminology across to everyone. The Festival dell’Economia di Trento takes place every year at the end of May on the historic Palazzi of the old town in Trento. 
Well known economists explain and interpret current economic issues, both from an economic-scientific as well as from a social and entrepreneurial viewpoint. In the course of recent years, numerous economic scholars and managers such as Sir [[Anthony Atkinson]], [[Fan Gang]], [[Zygmunt Bauman]] and the Nobel Prize winner [[Gary Becker]] took an active part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trentino.com/en/highlights/tradition-and-culture/economy-festival-trento/|title=Economy Festival Trento|publisher=trentino.com|accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
===Government===
{{See also|List of mayors of Trento}}
Trento is governed by the City Council of Trento. Voters elect directly 40 councilors and the Mayor of Trento every five years. The current Mayor of Trento is [[Franco Ianeselli]], elected for the first time on 21 September 2020. Ianeselli, a former trade unionist, was elected as a left-leaning independent with the support of a wide coalition of parties of both the left (such as Europa Verde) and the Catholic centre (like Partito Autonomista Trentino Tirolese and Insieme per Trento). When determining the composition of his Giunta (the equivalent of a City Cabinet), Ianeselli selected seven members of the City Council: Monica Baggia, Elisabetta Bozzarelli, Mariachiara Franzoia, Chiara Maule, Salvatore Panetta, Roberto Stanchina, and Paolo Zanella. However, in late November 2020 it became clear that Paolo Zanella would leave his position as a member of the Giunta to fill a vacancy in one of the 35 seats of the legislative assembly of the Trentino province, upon the resignation of Paolo Ghezzi. As of November 23, 2020, mayor Ianeselli has yet to announce who Zanella's successor will be.

===Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino===
In 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of [[Tyrol]] and the Italian autonomous provinces of [[South Tyrol]] and [[Trentino]] by recognizing the creation of the [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]].

== Main sights ==
[[File:Museo Diocesano Tridentino.jpg|thumb|right|[[Trento Cathedral|Duomo]]]]

[[File:Palazzo pretorio di Trento.jpg|thumb|right|Palazzo pretorio]]
Although off the beaten path of mass tourism, Trento offers rather interesting monuments. Its architecture has a unique feel, with both Italian Renaissance and Roman influences. The city center is small, and most Late-Medieval and Renaissance buildings have been restored to their original pastel colours and wooden balconies. Part of the medieval city walls is still visible in Piazza Fiera, along with a circular tower. Once, these walls encircled the entire city and were connected to the Castello del Buonconsiglio.
The main monuments of the city include:
* '''''[[Trento Cathedral|Duomo]]''''' (Cathedral of [[Saint Vigilius]]), a Romanesque-Gothic cathedral of the twelfth-thirteenth century, built on top of a late-Roman basilica (viewable in an underground crypt).
* '''''Piazza Duomo''''', on the side of the cathedral, with frescoed Renaissance buildings and the Late Baroque Fountain of Neptune (''Fontana di Nettuno'') built in 1767–1768.
* '''[[Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Trento|Church of Santa Maria Maggiore]]''' (1520), site of the preparatory congregations of the Third Council of Trent (April 1562 – December 1563). It was built for Bishop [[Bernardo Clesio]] by the architect Antonio Medaglia in Renaissance-Gothic style. The façade has a notable 16th-century portal, while the interior has works by [[Giambettino Cignaroli]] and [[Gian Battista Moroni|Moroni]].
* '''''Castello del Buonconsiglio''''' ('''[[Buonconsiglio Castle]]'''), which includes a museum and the notable Torre dell'Aquila, with a cycle of fine Gothic frescoes depicting the months, commissioned by the prince-bishop Georg von Lichtenstein.
* '''Church of San Pietro''' (12th century) It has a neo-Gothic façade added in 1848–1850.
* '''Church of Sant'Apollinare''', erected in the 13th century at the feet of the Doss Trento hill.
* '''Church of San Lorenzo''' (12th century). It has a Romanesque apse.
* '''''Torre Verde''''' ('''Green Tower'''), along the former transit path of the [[Adige]] river, is said to be where persons executed in the name of the Prince-Bishop were deposited in the river.
* '''''[[Palazzo delle Albere]]''''' ('''Palace of the Trees'''), a Renaissance villa next to the Adige river built around 1550 by the Madruzzo family, now hosting a modern art museum.
* '''''Palazzo Pretorio''''', next to the Duomo, of the 12th century, with a bell tower (''Torre Civica'') of the thirteenth century (it now hosts a collection of baroque paintings of religious themes). It was the main Bishops' residence until the mid-13th century.
* '''''[[Palazzo Salvadori]]''''' (1515).
* '''''Palazzo Geremia''''' (late 15th century). It has a Renaissance exterior and Gothic interiors.
* '''''Palazzo Lodron''''', built during the Council of Trent. The interior has a large fresco cycle.
* Various underground remains of the streets and villas of the Roman city (in Via Prepositura and Piazza Cesare Battisti).

Trento also sports [[modernist]] architecture, including the train station and the central post office, both by rationalist architect [[Angiolo Mazzoni]]. In particular, the train station (1934–36) is considered a landmark building of Italian railways architecture and combines many varieties of local stone with the most advanced building materials of the time: glass, reinforced concrete, metal. The post office was once decorated with colored windows by [[Fortunato Depero]], but these were destroyed during bombings in World War II. Other buildings of that time include the Grand Hotel (by G. Lorenzi) with some guest rooms furnished with futurist furniture by Depero, and the &quot;R. Sanzio&quot; Primary School built in 1931–34 and designed by [[Adalberto Libera]].

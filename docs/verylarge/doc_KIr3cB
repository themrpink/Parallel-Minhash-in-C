It used the [[cuneiform script]], which was originally used to write the unrelated, and also extinct, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] (which is a [[language isolate]]). Akkadian is named after the city of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], a major centre of Mesopotamian civilization during the [[Akkadian Empire]] (c. 2334–2154 BC).

The mutual influence between Sumerian and Akkadian had led scholars to describe the languages as a ''[[Sprachbund]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] US|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akkadian proper names were first attested in Sumerian texts from around the mid 3rd-millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/3139/1/PAGE_31%2D71.pdf] Andrew George, &quot;Babylonian and Assyrian: A History of Akkadian&quot;, In: Postgate, J. N., (ed.), ''Languages of Iraq, Ancient and Modern''. London: British School of Archaeology in Iraq, pp. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; 
From about the 25th or 24th century BC, texts fully written in Akkadian begin to appear. 
By the 10th century BC, two variant forms of the language were in use in Assyria and Babylonia, known as '''Assyrian''' and '''Babylonian''' respectively.
The bulk of preserved material is from this later period, corresponding to the Near Eastern [[Iron Age]]. In total, hundreds of thousands of texts and text fragments have been excavated, covering a vast textual tradition of mythological narrative, legal texts, scientific works, correspondence, political and military events, and many other examples. 

Akkadian (in its Assyrian and Babylonian varieties) was the native language of the Mesopotamian empires ([[Akkadian Empire]], [[Old Assyrian Empire]], [[Babylonia]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire]]) throughout the later Bronze Age, and Akkadian became the [[lingua franca]] of much of the Ancient [[Near East]] by the time of the [[Bronze Age collapse]] c 1150 BC. Its decline began in the Iron Age,   during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], by about the 8th century BC ([[Tiglath-Pileser III]]), 
in favour of [[Old Aramaic language|Old Aramaic]].  By the [[Hellenistic period]], the language was largely confined to scholars and priests working in temples in Assyria and Babylonia. The last known Akkadian cuneiform document dates from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geller |first1=Markham Judah |title=The Last Wedge |journal=Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und Vorderasiatische Archäologie |date=1997 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=43–95 |doi=10.1515/zava.1997.87.1.43|s2cid=161968187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akkadian is a [[fusional language]] with [[grammatical case]]; and like all Semitic languages, Akkadian uses the system of [[Semitic root|consonantal roots]]. The [[Kültepe texts]], which were written in Old Assyrian, include [[Hittite language|Hittite]] loanwords and names, which constitute the oldest record of any [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]].&lt;ref&gt;E.

Akkadian belongs with the other [[Semitic languages]] in the [[Near East]]ern branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages]], a family native to the [[Middle East]], [[Arabian Peninsula]], the [[Horn of Africa]], parts of [[Anatolia]], [[North Africa]], [[Malta]], [[Canary Islands]] and parts of [[West Africa]] ([[Hausa language|Hausa]]). Akkadian and its successor Aramaic, however, are only ever attested in Mesopotamia and the Near East.

Within the Near Eastern Semitic languages, Akkadian forms an [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] subgroup (with [[Eblaite language|Eblaite]]). This group distinguishes itself from the Northwest and South Semitic languages by its [[subject–object–verb]] word order, while the other Semitic languages usually have either a [[verb–subject–object]] or [[subject–verb–object]] order.

Additionally Akkadian is the only Semitic language to use the [[preposition and postposition|preposition]]s ''ina'' and ''ana'' ([[locative case]], English ''in''/''on''/''with'', and [[dative case|dative]]-locative case, ''for''/''to'', respectively). Other Semitic languages like [[Arabic]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] have the prepositions ''bi/bə'' and ''li/lə'' (locative and dative, respectively). The origin of the Akkadian spatial prepositions is unknown.

In contrast to most other Semitic languages, Akkadian has only one non-sibilant [[fricative consonant|fricative]]: '''ḫ''' {{IPA|[x]}}. Akkadian lost both the [[glottal consonant|glottal]] and [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] fricatives, which are characteristic of the other Semitic languages. Until the Old Babylonian period, the Akkadian [[sibilant]]s were exclusively [[affricate consonant|affricated]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==History and writing==

===Writing===
{{Main|Akkadian cuneiform}}
[[Image:AkkadischLand.png|200px|thumb|[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform writing]] (Neoassyrian script)&lt;br /&gt;(1 = Logogram (LG) &quot;mix&quot;/syllabogram (SG) ''{{IPA|ḫi}}'',&lt;br /&gt;2 = LG &quot;moat&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;3 = SG ''{{IPA|aʾ}}'',&lt;br /&gt;4 = SG ''{{IPA|aḫ}}, {{IPA|eḫ}}, {{IPA|iḫ}}, {{IPA|uḫ}}'',&lt;br /&gt;5 = SG ''kam'',&lt;br /&gt;6 = SG ''im'',&lt;br /&gt;7 = SG ''bir'')]]
Old Akkadian is preserved on clay tablets dating back to c. 2500 BC. It was written using [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]], a script adopted from the Sumerians using wedge-shaped symbols pressed in wet clay. As employed by Akkadian scribes, the adapted cuneiform script could represent either (a) [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[logogram]]s (''i.e.'', picture-based characters representing entire words), (b) Sumerian syllables, (c) Akkadian syllables, or (d) [[phonetic complement]]s. However, in Akkadian the script practically became a fully fledged [[Syllabary|syllabic script]], and the original [[Logogram|logographic]] nature of cuneiform became secondary, though logograms for frequent words such as 'god' and 'temple' continued to be used. For this reason, the sign ''AN'' can on the one hand be a logogram for the word ''ilum'' ('god') and on the other signify the god [[Anu]] or even the syllable ''-an-''. Additionally, this sign was used as a [[determinative]] for divine names.

Another peculiarity of Akkadian cuneiform is that many signs do not have a well-defined phonetic value. Certain signs, such as ''{{transl|sem|AḪ}}'', do not distinguish between the different [[vowel]] qualities. Nor is there any coordination in the other direction; the syllable ''{{transl|sem|-ša-}}'', for example, is rendered by the sign ''{{transl|sem|ŠA}}'', but also by the sign ''{{transl|sem|NĪĜ}}''. Both of these are often used for the same syllable in the same text.

Cuneiform was in many ways unsuited to Akkadian: among its flaws was its inability to represent important [[phonemes]] in Semitic, including a [[glottal stop]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeals]], and [[emphatic consonant]]s. In addition, cuneiform was a [[syllabary]] writing system—i.e., a consonant plus vowel comprised one writing unit—frequently inappropriate for a Semitic language made up of [[Triliteral|triconsonantal root]]s (i.e., three consonants plus any vowels).

===Development===
Akkadian is divided into several [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] based on [[geography]] and [[historical period]]:&lt;ref&gt;Caplice, p.5 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Old Akkadian, 2500–1950 BC
*Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian, 1950–1530 BC
*Middle Babylonian and Middle Assyrian, 1530–1000 BC
*Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian, 1000–600 BC
*Late Babylonian, 600 BC–100 AD

One of the earliest known Akkadian inscriptions was found on a bowl at [[Ur]], addressed to the very early pre-Sargonic king Meskiagnunna of Ur (c. 2485–2450 BC) by his queen Gan-saman, who is thought to have been from Akkad.&lt;ref name=Bertman_94&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bertman|first1=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-019-518364-1|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1C4NKp4zgIQC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Akkadian Empire]], established by [[Sargon of Akkad]], introduced the Akkadian language (the &quot;language of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]&quot;) as a written language, adapting [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] cuneiform orthography for the purpose. During the [[Middle Bronze Age]] (Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian period), the language virtually displaced Sumerian, which is assumed to have been extinct as a living language by the 18th century BC.

Old Akkadian, which was used until the end of the 3rd millennium BC, differed from both Babylonian and Assyrian, and was displaced by these dialects. By the 21st century BC Babylonian and Assyrian, which were to become the primary dialects, were easily distinguishable. Old Babylonian, along with the closely related dialect [[Mari, Syria|Mariotic]], is clearly more innovative than the Old Assyrian dialect and the more distantly related [[Eblaite language]]. For this reason, forms like ''lu-prus'' ('I will decide') were first encountered in Old Babylonian instead of the older ''la-prus''. While generally more archaic, Assyrian developed certain innovations as well, such as the &quot;Assyrian [[vowel harmony]]&quot;. Eblaite was even more so, retaining a productive [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] and a [[relative pronoun]] declined in case, number and gender. Both of these had already disappeared in Old Akkadian. Over 20,000 cuneiform tablets in Old Akkadian have been recovered from the [[Kültepe]] site in [[Anatolia]]. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use both of [[cuneiform]] and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Veenhof, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri V, Turk Tarih Kurumu, 2010, {{ISBN|978-975-16-2235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Babylonian was the language of king [[Hammurabi]] and his [[Code of Hammurabi|code]], which is one of the oldest collections of laws in the world. (see [[Code of Ur-Nammu]].) The Middle Babylonian (or Assyrian) period started in the 16th century BC. The division is marked by the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion of Babylonia around 1550 BC. The Kassites, who reigned for 300 years, gave up their own language in favor of Akkadian, but they had little influence on the language. At its apogee, Middle Babylonian was the written language of diplomacy of the entire [[Ancient Near East]], including Egypt. During this period, a large number of loan words were included in the language from [[Northwest Semitic languages]] and [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]; however, the use of these words was confined to the fringes of the Akkadian-speaking territory.

Middle Assyrian served as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in much of the [[Ancient Near East]] of the [[Late Bronze Age]] ([[Amarna Period]]). During the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], Neo-Assyrian began to turn into a chancellery language, being marginalized by [[Old Aramaic]]. Under the [[Achaemenids]], Aramaic continued to prosper, but Assyrian continued its decline. The language's final demise came about during the [[Hellenistic period]] when it was further marginalized by [[Koine Greek]], even though Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use in literary tradition well into [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] times. The latest known text in cuneiform Babylonian is an astronomical almanac dated to 79/80 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hunger |first1=Hermann |last2=de Jong |first2=Teije |title=Almanac W22340a From Uruk: The Latest Datable Cuneiform Tablet |journal=Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und vorderasiatische Archäologie |date=30 January 2014 |volume=104 |issue=2 |doi=10.1515/za-2014-0015|s2cid=163700758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the latest cuneiform texts are almost entirely written in Sumerian logograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=C.

[[File:Cuneiform script.jpg|thumb|An Akkadian inscription]]
Old Assyrian developed as well during the second millennium BC, but because it was a purely popular language &amp;mdash; kings wrote in Babylonian &amp;mdash; few long texts are preserved. From 1500 BC onwards, the language is termed Middle Assyrian.

During the first millennium BC, Akkadian progressively lost its status as a ''lingua franca''. In the beginning, from around 1000 BC, Akkadian and [[Aramaic]] were of equal status, as can be seen in the number of copied texts: clay tablets were written in Akkadian, while scribes writing on papyrus and leather used Aramaic. From this period on, one speaks of [[Neo-Babylonian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian]]. Neo-Assyrian received an upswing in popularity in the 10th century BC when the Assyrian kingdom became a major power with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], but texts written 'exclusively' in Neo-Assyrian disappear within 10 years of [[Nineveh]]'s destruction in 612 BC. The dominance of the Neo-Assyrian Empire under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] over [[Aram-Damascus]] in the middle of the 8th century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a ''lingua franca''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sejongjul.org/archive/view_article?pid=jul-5-1-1|title=Aramaic as a Lingua Franca During the Persian Empire (538-333 B.C.E.)|last1=Bae|first1=Chul-hyun|date=2004|journal=Journal of Universal Language|volume=5|pages=1–20|doi=10.22425/jul.2004.5.1.1|access-date=2018-12-20|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the empire, rather than it being eclipsed by Akkadian.

After the end of the Mesopotamian kingdoms, which were conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], Akkadian (which existed solely in the form of Late Babylonian) disappeared as a popular language. However, the language was still used in its written form; and even after the Greek invasion under [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BC, Akkadian was still a contender as a written language, but spoken Akkadian was likely extinct by this time, or at least rarely used.  The last positively identified Akkadian text comes from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;John Huehnergard &amp; Christopher Woods, 2004 &quot;Akkadian and Eblaite&quot;, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages'', pg. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akkadian language began to be rediscovered when [[Carsten Niebuhr]] in 1767 was able to make extensive copies of cuneiform texts and published them in Denmark. The deciphering of the texts started immediately, and bilinguals, in particular [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]-Akkadian bilinguals, were of great help. Since the texts contained several royal names, isolated signs could be identified, and were presented in 1802 by [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]]. By this time it was already evident that Akkadian was a Semitic language, and the final breakthrough in deciphering the language came from [[Edward Hincks]], [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] and [[Jules Oppert]] in the middle of the 19th century.  The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago recently completed a 21-volume dictionary of the Akkadian language, which is available commercially and [http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/assyrian-dictionary-oriental-institute-university-chicago-cad online].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13715296 | title=Dictionary 90 years in the making| work=BBC News| date=2011-06-14| last1=Hebblethwaite| first1=Cordelia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialects===
The following table summarises the dialects of Akkadian identified with certainty so far.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 |+ Known Akkadian dialects
 ! Dialect !! Location
 |-
 | Assyrian || Northern Mesopotamia
 |-
 | Babylonian || Central and Southern Mesopotamia
 |-
 | Mariotic || Central Euphrates (in and around the city of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]])
 |-
 | Tell Beydar || Northern Syria (in and around [[Tell Beydar]])
 |}

Some researchers (such as W. Sommerfeld 2003) believe that the Old Akkadian variant used in the older texts is not an ancestor of the later Assyrian and Babylonian dialects, but rather a separate dialect that was replaced by these two dialects and which died out early.

[[Eblaite language|Eblaite]], formerly thought of as yet another Akkadian dialect, is now generally considered a separate East Semitic language.

==Phonetics and phonology==
{{anchor|Phonology}}
Because Akkadian as a spoken language is extinct and no contemporary descriptions of the pronunciation are known, little can be said with certainty about the [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] of Akkadian. Some conclusions can be made, however, due to the relationship to the other [[Semitic language]]s and variant spellings of Akkadian words.

===Consonants===

The following table gives the [[consonant]] sounds distinguished in the Akkadian use of cuneiform, with the presumed pronunciation in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription according to Huehnergard and Woods,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; which most closely corresponds to recent reconstructions of [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic phonology]]. The parenthesised symbol following is the transcription used in the literature, in the cases where that symbol is different from the phonetic symbol. This transcription has been suggested for all Semitic languages by the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft]] (DMG), and is therefore known as ''DMG-Umschrift''.

=== Reconstruction ===

Akkadian emphatic consonants are typically reconstructed as [[Ejective consonant|ejectives]], which are thought to be the oldest realization of emphatics across the Semitic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Semitic Languages|last1 = Hetzron|first1 = Robert|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One piece of evidence for this is that Akkadian shows a development known as [[Geers' law]], where one of two emphatic consonants dissimilates to the corresponding non-emphatic consonant. For the sibilants, traditionally /š/ has been held to be postalveolar {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, and /s/, /z/, /{{transl|sem|ṣ}}/ analyzed as fricatives; but attested [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilations]] in Akkadian suggest otherwise.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kogan, Leonid (2011). &quot;Proto-Semitic Phonetics and Phonology&quot;. In Semitic languages: an international handbook, Stefan Weninger, ed. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when the possessive suffix ''-šu'' is added to the root ''awat'' ('word'), it is written ''awassu'' ('his word') even though ''šš'' would be expected. The most straightforward interpretation of this shift from ''tš'' to ''ss'' is that /s, ṣ/ form a pair of voiceless alveolar affricates {{IPA|[t͡s t͡sʼ]}}, *š is a voiceless alveolar fricative {{IPA|[s]}}, and *z is a voiced alveolar affricate or fricative {{IPA|[d͡z~z]}}. The assimilation is then [awat+su] &gt; {{IPA|[awatt͡su]}}. In this vein, an alternative transcription of *š is *s̠, with the macron below indicating a soft (lenis) articulation in Semitic transcription. Other interpretations are possible, however. {{IPA|[ʃ]}} could have been assimilated to the preceding {{IPA|[t]}}, yielding {{IPA|[ts]}}, which would later have been simplified to {{IPA|[ss]}}.

The phoneme /r/ has traditionally been interpreted as a trill but its pattern of alternation with /{{transl|ar|DIN|ḫ}}/ suggests it was a velar (or uvular) fricative. In the Hellenistic period, Akkadian /r/ was transcribed using the Greek ρ, indicating it was pronounced similarly as an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|alveolar trill]] (though Greeks may also have perceived a [[uvular trill]] as ρ).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Descent from Proto-Semitic ===
Several [[Proto-Semitic]] phonemes are lost in Akkadian. The Proto-Semitic glottal stop {{transl|sem|[[Aleph (letter)|*ʾ]]}}, as well as the fricatives {{transl|sem|[[Ayin|*ʿ]]}}, {{transl|sem|[[He (letter)|*h]]}}, {{transl|sem|[[Heth (letter)|*ḥ]]}} are lost as consonants, either by sound change or orthographically, but they gave rise to the vowel quality ''e'' not exhibited in Proto-Semitic. The [[voiceless lateral fricatives]] ({{transl|sem|[[Śawt|*ś]], [[Ḍād|*ṣ́]]}}) merged with the sibilants as in [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]], leaving 19 consonantal phonemes. Old Akkadian preserved the /*ś/ phoneme longest but it eventually merged with [[Shin (letter)|/*š/]], beginning in the [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A descriptive grammar of Sumerian|url = https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/16107|website = openaccess.leidenuniv.nl|accessdate = 2015-11-20|first1 = Jagersma, Abraham|last1 = Hendrik|page = 46|date = 2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table shows Proto-Semitic phonemes and their correspondences among Akkadian, [[Modern Standard Arabic]] and [[Tiberian Hebrew]]:

The existence of a back mid-vowel {{IPA|/o/}} has been proposed, but the cuneiform writing gives no good proof for this.&lt;ref&gt;Sabatino Moscati et al. &quot;An Introduction to Comparative Grammar of Semitic Languages Phonology and Morphology&quot;. (section on vowels and semi-vowels)&lt;/ref&gt; There is limited contrast between different u-signs in lexical texts, but this scribal differentiation may reflect the superimposition of the Sumerian phonological system (for which an /o/ phoneme has also been proposed), rather than a separate phoneme in Akkadian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Akkadian and Eblaite|url = https://www.academia.edu/6933497|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-19|last = Huehnergard &amp; Woods|page = 233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All consonants and [[vowel]]s appear in long and short forms. Long consonants are represented in writing as double consonants, and long vowels are written with a macron (ā, ē, ī, ū). This distinction is [[phoneme|phonemic]], and is used in the grammar, for example ''iprusu'' ('that he decided') versus ''iprusū'' ('they decided').

===Stress===
The [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] patterns of Akkadian are disputed, with some authors claiming that nothing is known of the topic. There are however certain points of reference, such as the rule of vowel syncope, and some forms in the cuneiform that might represent the stressing of certain vowels; however, attempts at identifying a rule for stress have so far been unsuccessful.

Huenergard (2005:3-4) claims that stress in Akkadian is completely predictable. In his syllable typology there are three syllable weights: ''light'' (V, CV); ''heavy'' (CVC, CV̄, CV̂), and ''superheavy'' (CV̂C). If the last syllable is superheavy, it is stressed, otherwise the rightmost heavy non-final syllable is stressed. If a word contains only light syllables, the first syllable is stressed.

A rule of Akkadian phonology is that certain short (and probably unstressed) vowels are dropped. The rule is that the last vowel of a succession of syllables that end in a short vowel is dropped, for example the declinational root of the verbal adjective of a root PRS is ''PaRiS-''. Thus the masculine singular nominative is ''PaRS-um'' (&lt; ''*PaRiS-um'') but the feminine singular nominative is ''PaRiStum'' (&lt; ''*PaRiS-at-um''). Additionally there is a general tendency of syncope of short vowels in the later stages of Akkadian.

===Morphology===

====Consonantal root====
Most roots of the Akkadian language consist of three consonants (called the radicals), but some roots are composed of four consonants (so-called quadriradicals). The radicals are occasionally represented in transcription in upper-case letters, for example ''PRS'' (to decide). Between and around these radicals various [[infix]]es, [[suffix]]es and [[prefix]]es, having word generating or grammatical functions, are inserted. The resulting consonant-vowel pattern differentiates the original meaning of the root. Also, the middle radical can be geminated, which is represented by a doubled consonant in transcription (and sometimes in the cuneiform writing itself).

The consonants ''{{IPA|ʔ}}'', ''{{IPA|w}}'', ''{{IPA|j}}'' and ''{{IPA|n}}'' are termed &quot;weak radicals&quot; and roots containing these radicals give rise to irregular forms.

==== Case, number and gender ====
Formally, Akkadian has three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and three cases ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Genitive case|genitive]]). However, even in the earlier stages of the language, the dual number is vestigial, and its use is largely confined to natural pairs (eyes, ears, etc.), and adjectives are never found in the dual. In the dual and plural, the accusative and genitive are merged into a single [[oblique case]].

Akkadian, unlike [[Arabic language|Arabic]],has only &quot;sound&quot; plurals formed by means of a plural ending (i.e. no [[broken plurals]] formed by changing the word stem). As in all Semitic languages, some masculine nouns take the prototypically feminine plural ending (''-āt'').

The nouns ''šarrum'' (king) and ''šarratum'' (queen) and the adjective ''dannum'' (strong) will serve to illustrate the case system of Akkadian.

==Responsibilities==
The [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] (DoN) consists of two [[United States Uniformed Services|Uniformed Services]]: the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The US Navy |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/leadership/secnav_resp.asp |accessdate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secretary of the Navy is responsible for, and has statutory authority ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|5013}}) to &quot;conduct all the affairs of the Department of the Navy&quot;, i.e. as its [[chief executive officer]], subject to the limits of the law, and the directions of the [[President of the United States|President]] and the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. In effect, all authority within the Navy and Marine Corps, unless specifically exempted by law, is derivative of the authority vested in the secretary of the Navy.

Specifically enumerated responsibilities of the SECNAV in the before-mentioned section are: recruiting, organizing, supplying, equipping, training, mobilizing, and demobilizing. The Secretary also oversees the construction, outfitting, and repair of naval ships, equipment, and facilities. SECNAV is responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies and programs that are consistent with the national security policies and objectives established by the President or the Secretary of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US CODE: Title 10,5013. Secretary of the Navy |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5013- |accessdate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Navy Biographies – The Honorable Donald C. Winter |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/bio.asp?bioID=325 |accessdate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secretary of the Navy is a member of the [[Defense Acquisition Board]] (DAB), chaired by the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics]]. Furthermore, the Secretary has several statutory responsibilities under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) with respect to the administration of the military justice system for the Navy &amp; the Marine Corps, including the authority to convene general courts-martial and to commute sentences.

The principal military advisers to the SECNAV are the two service chiefs of the naval services: for matters regarding the Navy the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO), and for matters regarding the Marine Corps the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] (CMC). The CNO and the Commandant act as the principal executive agents of the SECNAV within their respective services to implement the orders of the Secretary.

===Navy Regulations===
The [[United States Navy Regulations]] is the principal regulatory document of the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]], and all changes to it must be approved by the secretary of the Navy.

===U.S. Coast Guard===
Whenever the [[United States Coast Guard]] operates as a service within the Department of the Navy, the secretary of the Navy has the same powers and duties with respect to the Coast Guard as the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Department of the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US CODE: Title 10,5013a. Secretary of the Navy: powers with respect to Coast Guard |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5013a- |accessdate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Navy Secretariat==
The '''Office of the Secretary of the Navy''', also known within DoD as the ''Navy Secretariat'' or simply just as the ''Secretariat'' in a DoN setting, is the immediate headquarters staff that supports the Secretary in discharging his duties. The principal officials of the Secretariat include the [[under secretary of the Navy]] (the Secretary's principal civilian deputy), the [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy|assistant secretaries of the Navy]] (ASN), the [[general counsel of the Department of the Navy]], the [[judge advocate general of the Navy]] (JAG), the Naval inspector general (NIG), the chief of Legislative Affairs, and the [[chief of naval research]]. The Office of the Secretary of the Navy has sole responsibility within the Department of the Navy for acquisition, auditing, financial and information management, legislative affairs, public affairs, research, and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US CODE: Title 10,5014. Office of the Secretary of the Navy |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5014- |accessdate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[chief of naval operations]] and the [[commandant of the Marine Corps]] have their own separate staffs, the ''[[Office of the Chief of Naval Operations]]'' (also known by its acronym OPNAV) and ''[[Headquarters Marine Corps]]''.

The '''United States Attorney General''' ('''AG''') is the head of the [[United States Department of Justice]], the chief lawyer of the [[federal government of the United States]], and a member of the [[Cabinet of the United States]].

Under the [[Appointments Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], the officeholder is nominated through the power of appointment by the [[President of the United States]], then appointed with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate]]. The Attorney General is supported by the Office of the Attorney General, which includes executive staff and several deputies.

The 85th and current United States Attorney General is [[William P. Barr]], appointed by [[Donald J. Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/william-barr-confirmed.html|title=Senate Confirms William Barr as Attorney General |last=Fandos|first=Nicholas|date=2019-02-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-02-14|last2=Benner|first2=Katie|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|United States Department of Justice#History}}
[[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] which, among other things, established the Office of the Attorney General. The original duties of this officer were &quot;to prosecute and conduct all suits in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in which the United States shall be concerned, and to give his advice and opinion upon [[questions of law]] when required by the president of the United States, or when requested by the heads of any of the departments&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judiciary Act of 1789]], section 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these duties have since been transferred to the [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] and the [[White House Counsel]].

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] was established in 1870 to support the attorneys general in the discharge of their responsibilities.

The attorney general, the [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|secretary of the treasury]], and the [[United States Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]] are generally regarded as the four most important [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] officials in the United States because of the size and importance of their respective departments.&lt;ref&gt;''Cabinets and Counselors: The President and the Executive Branch'' (1997). [[Congressional Quarterly]]. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title &quot;Attorney General&quot; is an example of a noun (''attorney'') followed by a [[postpositive adjective]] (''general'').&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herz|first=Michael|date=2002|title=Washington, Patton, Schwarzkopf and ... Ashcroft?|url=https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/concomm/771|journal=Constitutional Commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;General&quot; is a description of the type of attorney, not a title or rank in itself ([[General officer|as it would be in the military]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Even though the attorney general (and the similarly titled [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]]) is often referred to as &quot;General&quot; or &quot;General [last name]&quot; by senior government officials, this is considered incorrect in standard [[American English]] usage.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abovethelaw.com/career-files/lawprose-lesson-116-whats-the-plural-form-of-attorney-general-and-what-is-the-plural-possessive/|title=LawProse Lesson #116: What’s the plural form of attorney general? And what is the plural possessive?|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|website=Above the Law|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, the correct American English plural form is &quot;attorneys general&quot; rather than &quot;attorney generals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

==Presidential transition==
It is the practice for the attorney general, along with the other Cabinet secretaries and high-level [[Political appointments in the United States|political appointees of the president]], to tender a resignation with effect on the [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]] (January 20) of a new president. The [[Deputy Attorney General of the United States|deputy attorney general]] is also expected to tender a resignation, but is commonly requested to stay on and act as Attorney General pending the [[Advice and consent#United States|confirmation by the Senate]] of the new attorney general.

For example, on the inauguration of President [[Donald Trump]] on January 20, 2017, the then-Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] left her position, so the then-Deputy Attorney General [[Sally Yates]], who had also tendered her resignation, was asked to stay on to serve as Acting Attorney General until the confirmation of the new attorney general [[Jeff Sessions]], who had been nominated for the office in November 2016 by then-[[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Donald Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-us-attorneys-233740|title=Trump will allow U.S. attorneys to stay past Friday |last=Gerstein |first=Josh |website=POLITICO |language=en|access-date=2019-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Unusually for a transitional acting appointment, Yates was dismissed and replaced with another Acting Attorney General before Sessions was confirmed because she refused to defend an [[executive order]] of the incoming administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/meet-the-acting-attorney-general-fired-by-trump-and-accused-of-betraying-the-justice-department/2017/01/30/05d4478c-e750-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html|title=Who is Sally Yates?

The word ''dysphemism'' was composed from the [[Greek language|Greek]] elements ''dys'' δύς &quot;mis-&quot; and ''pheme'' φήμη &quot;speech, voice, reputation&quot; in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1972, [https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/58899 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Related terms include ''malphemism'' (from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] ''malus'' &quot;bad&quot;), and ''cacophemism'' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kakos'' κακός &quot;bad&quot;).

== Usage ==
A dysphemism is a [[Markedness|marked]] form which expresses a speaker's view or attitude towards the listener or group. 

== Types ==

=== Synecdoche ===
One kind of dysphemism is [[Synecdoche|synecdochic]], where a part is used to represent the whole,&lt;ref name=&quot;E &amp; D&quot; /&gt; such as  &quot;What an asshole.&quot;

=== Dysphemistic epithets ===
Animal names are frequently used as dysphemistic epithets. By using one, the speaker offends the listener by targeting their humanity. Examples include &quot;bitch&quot;, &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;chicken&quot;, &quot;weasel&quot;, &quot;sheep&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;, and &quot;rat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rawson 1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rawson|first=Hugh|title=Wicked words: a treasury of curses, insults, put-downs, and other formerly unprintable terms from Anglo-Saxon times to the present|year=1989|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-57334-2|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/h00hugh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name dysphemism ===
When a person uses another's name rather than an appropriate kinship term or title of address.{{Clarify|reason=incomplete sentence|date=March 2015}} The speaker uses a more casual or lower style than is appropriate given the social context.
* &quot;Peter, what are you doing?&quot; (rather than &quot;Dad&quot;/&quot;Father&quot;)
* &quot;How are you doing, Bill?&quot; (rather than &quot;Uncle Bill&quot;)

(Many languages, to a greater extent than in English, use different forms to indicate respect, and thus provide more scope for such dysphemism and require care by non-native speakers to avoid causing offence by unintentional dysphemism.)

This use of language may not constitute dysphemism if the choice of words used by the speaker is welcomed by the listener, such as a father who prefers being called by his given name as opposed to &quot;Dad&quot;/&quot;Father&quot;. In that case it would appeal to the listener's positive face rather than damage it, and would thus not be a dysphemism.

Similarly, being more formal with someone than expected may be a type of dysphemism. For example, if a child usually calls their father &quot;dad&quot; or &quot;papa,&quot; calling him &quot;father&quot; may be a way of offending or antagonizing him, by implying that he is merely his role, not someone the child is close with. Similarly if a child usually called &quot;Billy&quot; is addressed by a parent as &quot;William&quot;.

Dysphemism may also be indicated by the disuse or substitution of someone's name or title. For instance, someone named Teresa who made overstated claims for a company-paid trip could be described as &quot;the little witch who charmed the boss into approving that phony expense report&quot;.

Anger or dissatisfaction with the listener (or group of people) may compel a speaker to use a name dysphemism or term of address dysphemism.&lt;ref name=&quot;E &amp; D&quot; /&gt;

=== Cross-cultural dysphemism ===
Various [[slang]] terms that are dysphemistic in one culture may not be if they hold a different meaning in another culture. For instance, the word &quot;fag&quot; when used in American English is typically a [[Faggot (slang)|slur against gay men]]. However, in British English, the word &quot;fag&quot; is usually an inoffensive term used to refer to a cigarette, or, previously, a [[Fagging|junior boy who serves a senior boy]] in a British public school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Fag|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fag|work=The American Heritage Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the word &quot;fanny&quot; when used in American English is a euphemism for one's buttocks, so benign that children use it. However, in British, Australian, New Zealand, and South African English, the word &quot;fanny&quot; is slang for vulva, and is considered to be vulgar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Fanny|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fanny|work=The American Heritage Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

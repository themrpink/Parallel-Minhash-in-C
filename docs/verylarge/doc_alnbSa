Shanghai's rickshaw industry began in 1874 with 1,000 rickshaws imported from Japan. By 1914 there were 9,718 vehicles. The pullers were a large group of the city's working poor: 100,000 men pulled rickshaws by the early 1940s, up from 62,000 in the mid-1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | url=https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha/page/65 | url-access=registration | author=Hanchao Lu | publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha/page/65 65–66, 68] | isbn=0520215648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrary to coolies in Beijing, those in Shanghai mostly come from rural areas out of the city. With the destitution of their land, they poured into the city with their family. As the number of coolies rose up sharply, however, the number of rickshaw remained at 20,000 in Shanghai. Except private coolies, those for public work had to take turns, and thus their average income diminished to $9 per month. Therefore, many coolies worked in the factory and ran the rickshaw after work. However, many coolies were optimistic about life. They were satisfied about their income and dreamed of purchasing their own rickshaws and sending their kids to schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | url=https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha | url-access=registration | author=Hanchao Lu |publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha/page/68 68–81] |isbn=0520215648 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this low income, many coolies would not give customers a clear idea of standard price and thus charge higher at any chance they had. In response to this phenomenon, hotels would provide the distance to various streets and the price charged.&lt;ref&gt;Darwent, Charles Ewart.

Rickshaws were first imported to Hong Kong from Japan in 1880. They were a popular form of transport for many years, peaking at more than 3,000 in the 1920s. However, their popularity waned after [[World War II]]. No new licenses for rickshaws have been issued since 1975, and only a few old men—three as of 2017&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.td.gov.hk/mini_site/atd/2018/en/section3_t_10.html] Vehicle Licensing during - 2008-2017&lt;/ref&gt;—still hold a license.

Around 1880, rickshaws appeared in India, first in [[Shimla|Simla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Imperial Simla: the political culture of the Raj | author=Pamela Kanwar | edition=2| publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2003 | page=176 | isbn=0195667212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century it was introduced in [[Kolkata]] (Calcutta), India and in 1914 was a conveyance for hire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren p. 14&quot; /&gt;

In 1992, it was estimated that over 30,000 rickshaws were operating in the city, all but 6,000 of them illegally, lacking a license (no new licenses have been issued since 1945).  The large majority of rickshaw pullers rent their rickshaws for a few dollars per shift.  They live cheaply in hostels, trying to save money to send home. (Eide, 1993) Each ''dera'', a mixture of a garage, repair shop, and dormitory, has a ''sardar'' that manages it. Pullers often pay around 100 [[Indian rupee|rupees]] (around $2.50 United States dollars) per month to live in a ''dera''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trillin101to104&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Trillin |first=Calvin |date=April 2008 |title=Last Days of the Rickshaw |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/04/kolkata-rickshaws/calvin-trillin-text |magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |volume=213 |issue=4 |pages=101–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Muslim]] pullers often share housing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trillin100&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Trillin |first=Calvin |date=April 2008 |title=Last Days of the Rickshaw |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/04/kolkata-rickshaws/calvin-trillin-text |magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |volume=213 |issue=4 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pullers sleep in the streets in their rickshaws.

Motor vehicles are banned in the [[Eco-Sensitive Zone|Eco-sensitive zone]] area of [[Matheran]], [[India]], a tourist hill station near [[Mumbai]] so man-pulled rickshaws are still one of the major forms of transport there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Admin|title=Matheran: Smallest, peaceful &amp; vehicle-free hill station|url=http://www.indiapost.com/matheran-smallest-peaceful-vehicle-free-hill-station/|work=India Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, the Communist government of [[West Bengal]] announced plans to completely ban pulled rickshaws, resulting in protests and strikes of the pullers.&lt;ref&gt;WebIndia, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the chief minister of West Bengal, [[Buddhadeb Bhattacharya]], announced that pulled rickshaws would be banned and that rickshaw pullers would be rehabilitated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trillin97&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Trillin |first=Calvin |date=April 2008 |title=Last Days of the Rickshaw |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/04/kolkata-rickshaws/calvin-trillin-text |magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |volume=213 |issue=4 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Calvin Trillin of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' stated in a 2008 article that the city government has not decided how rickshaw drivers would be rehabilitated, nor has it settled on a date regarding when the government would decide.

====Japan====
There are several theories about the [[rickshaw|invention of the rickshaw]]. Japan historian Seidensticker wrote of the theories:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Though the origins of the rickshaw are not entirely clear, they seem to be Japanese, and of Tokyo specifically. The most widely accepted theory offers the name of three inventors, and gives 1869 as the date of invention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lu p. 348&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | url=https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha | url-access=registration | publisher=University of California Press | author=Hanchao Lu | year=1999 | location=1999 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha/page/348 348] | isbn=0520215648}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rickshaw's popularity in Japan declined by the 1930s with the advent of automated forms of transportation, like automobiles and trains. After World War II, when gasoline and automobiles were scarce, they made a temporary come-back. The rickshaw tradition has stayed alive in [[Kyoto]] and Tokyo's [[geisha]] districts&lt;ref name=&quot;De Mente p. 95&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Bizarre and the Wondrous from the Land of the Rising Sun! | publisher=Cultural-Insight Books | author=Boye De Mente | year=2010 | isbn=978-1456424756 | editor=Demetra De Ment | pages=95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Powerhouse /&gt; only for tourists as well as in other tourist places.

      <text bytes="8367" xml:space="preserve">'''Edmund Clerihew Bentley''' (10 July 1875 – 30 March 1956), who generally published under the names '''E. C. Bentley''' or '''E. Clerihew Bentley''', was a popular English novelist and humorist, and inventor of the [[clerihew]], an irregular form of humorous verse on biographical topics.

==Biography==
Bentley was born in [[London]] and educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] and [[Merton College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;Cohen, Nancy. &quot;Bentley, Edmund Clerihew (E. C.)&quot; In Gale, Steven H., ed. (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-fDkzVH1cC&amp;pg=PA138 ''Encyclopedia of British Humorists: Geoffrey Chaucer to John Cleese''], pp. 138–42. Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[John Edmund Bentley]], was professionally a civil servant but was also a rugby union international having played in the first ever international match for England against Scotland in 1871. Bentley worked as a journalist on several newspapers, including the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} He also worked for the imperialist weekly called ''[[The Outlook (British magazine)|The Outlook]]'' during the editorship of [[James Louis Garvin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fleet Street Stir |newspaper=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer |date=28 February 1942 |page=4 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/19420228/124/0004 |publisher=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |accessdate=2014-08-06}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first published collection of poetry, titled ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905),&lt;ref name=bentley&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|year=1905|title=Biography for Beginners|isbn=978-1-4437-5315-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; popularized the clerihew form; it was followed by two other collections, ''More Biography'' (1929) and ''Baseless Biography'' (1939).&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; His detective novel ''[[Trent's Last Case]]'' (1913)&lt;ref&gt;''Trent's Last Case,'' {{ISBN|978-0-7551-0327-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; was much praised, numbering [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] among its admirers, and with its labyrinthine and mystifying plotting can be seen as the first truly modern mystery. It was adapted as a [[Trent's Last Case (1920 film)|film in 1920]], [[Trent's Last Case (1929 film)|1929]], and [[Trent's Last Case (1952 film)|1952]]. The success of the work inspired him, after 23 years, to write a sequel, ''[[Trent's Own Case]]'' (1936). There was also a book of Trent short stories, ''Trent Intervenes'' (1938).

From 1936 until 1949 Bentley was president of the [[Detection Club]]. He contributed to two crime stories for the club's radio serials broadcast in 1930 and 1931,&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bruce (2014). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gwxWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 ''Jolly Good Detecting: Humor in English Crime Fiction of the Golden Age''], p. 75. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  which were published in 1983 as ''[[The Scoop and Behind The Screen]]''. In 1950 he contributed the introduction to a [[Constable &amp; Robinson|Constable &amp; Co]] omnibus edition of [[Damon Runyon|Damon Runyon's]] &quot;stories of the bandits of Broadway&quot;, which was republished by [[Penguin Books]] in 1990 as ''On Broadway''.

He died in 1956 in London at the age of 80. His son [[Nicolas Bentley]] was an illustrator.

Phonographic recordings of his work &quot;Recordings for the Blind&quot; are heard in the film ''[[Places in the Heart]]'', by the character Mr. Will.

[[G. K. Chesterton]] dedicated his popular detective novel on anarchist terrorism, ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'', to Edmund Clerihew Bentley, a school friend.&lt;ref&gt;Stapleton, Julia (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=VD0aCiNb8rcC&amp;pg=PA15 ''Christianity, Patriotism, and Nationhood: The England of G. K. Chesterton''], p. 15. Lexington Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he is best known for his crime fiction and clerihews, Bentley also wrote at least one science fiction short story. This is the recently re-discovered &quot;Flying Visit&quot;, published in the [London] ''[[Evening Standard]]'' on 31 March 1953.

{{History of printing}}

'''Inkjet printing''' is a type of [[computer printing]] that recreates a [[digital image]] by propelling droplets of ink onto paper and plastic substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ink-jet|title=Ink-jet – Definition of ink-jet by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inkjet printers are the most commonly used type of printer,&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-1&quot; /&gt; and range from small inexpensive consumer models to expensive professional machines.

The concept of inkjet printing originated in the 20th century, and the technology was first extensively developed in the early 1950s. The world first inkjet printer was invented by Ichiro Endo, who worked for Canon in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.1ink.com/blog/the-history-of-printing/|title=The History of Printing|website=1ink.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1970s, inkjet printers that could [[Digital printing|reproduce digital images]] generated by computers were developed, mainly by [[Epson]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]]. In the worldwide consumer market, four manufacturers account for the majority of inkjet printer sales: Canon, HP, Epson and [[Brother Industries|Brother]].

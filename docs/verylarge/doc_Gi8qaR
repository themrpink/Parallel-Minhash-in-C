'''Vincent Anthony Guaraldi''' {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|r|æ|l|d|i}} (July 17, 1928&amp;nbsp;– February 6, 1976), born '''Vincent Anthony Dellaglio''', was an American [[jazz]] pianist noted for his innovative compositions and arrangements and for composing music for animated television adaptations of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip including their signature melody, &quot;[[Linus and Lucy]]&quot; and the holiday standard, &quot;[[Christmas Time Is Here]]&quot;. He is also known for his performances on piano as a member of [[Cal Tjader]]'s 1950s ensembles and for his own solo career. His 1962 composition &quot;[[Cast Your Fate to the Wind]]&quot; became a radio hit and won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1963 for [[Grammy Award for Best Original Jazz Composition|Best Original Jazz Composition]].

== Early career and Grammy Award ==
Guaraldi was born in San Francisco's [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] area, a place that became very important to his blossoming musical career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bang | first = Derrick | title = Vince Guaraldi at the Piano | year = 2012 | publisher = McFarland | location = [[Jefferson, North Carolina]] (U.S.) | isbn = 978-0-7864-5902-5 | url = http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-5902-5 | access-date = December 12, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120406085911/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-5902-5 | archive-date = April 6, 2012 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last name changed to &quot;Guaraldi&quot; after his mother, Carmella (née Marcellino; 1908-1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qstIu-I9N-sC&amp;q=carmella%20guaraldi&amp;pg=PP1|title = Vince Guaraldi at the Piano|isbn = 9780786490745|last1 = Bang|first1 = Derrick|date = January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; divorced his biological father (whose last name was Dellaglio) and married Tony Guaraldi, who adopted the boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;iITALY_20101224&quot; /&gt; His maternal uncle was musician, singer, and whistler [[Muzzy Marcellino]]. He graduated from [[Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco)|Lincoln High School]], attended [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]], and served in the [[United States Army]] as a cook in the [[Korean War]].

Guaraldi's first recording was made in November 1953 with [[Cal Tjader]] and was released early in 1954. The 10-inch [[LP record]] was called ''The Cal Tjader Trio'', and included &quot;Chopsticks Mambo&quot;, &quot;Vibra-Tharpe&quot;, and &quot;Lullaby of the Leaves&quot;. By 1955, Guaraldi had his own trio with [[Eddie Duran]] and Dean Reilly. He then reunited with Tjader in June 1956 and was an integral part of two bands that the vibraphonist assembled. The first band played mainly straight jazz and included Al Torre (drums), [[Eugene Wright]] (bass) and Luis Kant (congas and bongos). The second band was formed in the spring of 1958 and included [[Al McKibbon]] (bass), [[Mongo Santamaría]] (congas and bongos) and [[Willie Bobo]] (drums and timbales). Reed men [[Paul Horn (musician)|Paul Horn]] and Jose &quot;Chombo&quot; Silva were also added to the group for certain live performances and recordings.

Guaraldi left the group early in 1959 to pursue his own projects full-time. He might have remained a well-respected but minor jazz figure had he not written an original number to fill out his covers of Antonio Carlos Jobim/Luis Bonfá tunes on his 1962 album, ''[[Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus]]'', inspired by the French/Brazilian film ''[[Black Orpheus]]''. [[Fantasy Records]] released &quot;Samba de Orpheus&quot; as a single, trying to catch the building [[bossa nova]] wave, but it was destined to sink without a trace when radio DJs began flipping it over and playing the B-side, Guaraldi's &quot;[[Cast Your Fate to the Wind]]&quot;. A gentle, likeable tune, it stood out from everything else on the airwaves and became a grass-roots hit and won the Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Original Jazz Composition|Best Original Jazz Composition]]. While &quot;Cast Your Fate to the Wind&quot; by Guaraldi achieved modest chart success as a single in 1963, a cover version two years later by British group [[Sounds Orchestral]] cracked the Billboard top 10 (in the spring of 1965). Guaraldi never minded taking requests to play it when he appeared live. &quot;It's like signing the back of a check&quot;, he once remarked. When asked by ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' jazz critic [[Ralph J. Gleason]] if he felt like he sold out with the song, Guaraldi responded, &quot;I feel I bought in.&quot;&lt;ref name=keyboard/&gt;&lt;ref name=alljazzThomas/&gt;

Guaraldi also did not think highly of his piano skills, saying once, &quot;I don't think I'm a great piano player, but I would like to have people like me, to play pretty tunes and reach the audience. And I hope some of those tunes will become standards. I want to write standards, not just hits.&quot;&lt;ref name=BangPeanuts&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.fivecentsplease.org/dpb/pccbio.html | title = Vince Guaraldi: He worked for more than Peanuts | last = Bang | first = Derrick |website= fivecentsplease.org | publisher= Derrick Bang, Scott McGuire |access-date= 10 August 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guaraldi then recorded an album called ''[[Vince Guaraldi, Bola Sete and Friends]]'' with guitarist [[Bola Sete]], Fred Marshall (bass) and Jerry Granelli (drums). This began a period of collaboration between Guaraldi and Sete where Guaraldi began experimenting with bossa nova-influenced music as well as with the electric piano. This experimentation may have led to the loss of Fred Marshall, who left the group in 1964 citing &quot;personal differences&quot; after Guaraldi purportedly threw a cup of coffee at Marshall during the 17th Berkeley Jazz Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Downbeat: Vince Guaraldi Trio Takes A Permanent Coffee Break | journal = [[DownBeat]] | pages = 9 | date = August 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this time, Guaraldi was invited to compose a &quot;jazz mass&quot; with the Eucharist chorus of San Francisco's [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco|Grace Cathedral]]. Utilizing his Latin influences from his bossa nova days with Sete, Guaraldi composed a number of pieces with waltz tempos and jazz standards. The performance was recorded on May 21, 1965, and released that September as ''[[At Grace Cathedral]]''.&lt;ref name=BangPeanuts/&gt;

Guaraldi's relationship with Fantasy Records began to sour by late 1965 after it was learned he was receiving only five percent of every record sale while Fantasy retained the remaining 95 percent. He sued in April 1966 in an effort to sever all relationships with the label; Fantasy promptly countersued.&lt;ref name=Bangtimeline&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.fivecentsplease.org/dpb/VinceGuaralditimeline.html | title = Vince Guaraldi Timeline | last = Bang | first = Derrick |website= fivecentsplease.org | publisher= Derrick Bang, Scott McGuire |access-date= 25 June 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasy executive [[Saul Zaentz]] became president in 1967, eventually buying the company from original owners the Weiss brothers in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ycEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=%22saul+zaentz%22+%2B+1967+%2B+billboard&amp;pg=PA3 |title=7 Distributors Take Control Of Fantasy; Zaentz at Helm |magazine=Billboard |volume=79 |number=40 |date=7 October 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of Fantasy Records to Zaentz resulted in both Guaraldi and the label dismissing the twin lawsuits, leaving Guaraldi a free agent.&lt;ref name=Bangtimeline/&gt; His final album for the label, ''[[Live at El Matador]]'', had been released in October 1966. 35 years after Guaraldi's death, Fantasy Records and its parent company [[Concord Music]] were sued by Guaraldi's children for engaging in &quot;a system&quot; of &quot;serving false and deceptive statements while underreporting units sold and underpaying royalties.&quot; Their lawsuit, filed in December 2011, claimed a private accountant uncovered a discrepancy of at least $2 million for the years 2005–2010 alone. When asked if the alleged wrongdoing goes back decades further, the Guaraldi family's attorney Alan Neigher responded, &quot;Well, we hope it does.&quot;&lt;ref name=return&gt;{{cite news | first = Joe | last = Eskenazi | title = &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; and Lawsuits: Guaraldi Heirs Sue for Royalties | work = [[SF Weekly]] | date = January 11, 2012 | url = https://www.sfweekly.com/news/linus-and-lucy-and-lawsuits-guaraldi-heirs-sue-for-royalties/ | access-date = 24 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of flux with Fantasy in 1967, Guaraldi formed his own record label, D&amp;D (named after his children, David and Dia), and released his only album on the label in December 1967, ''[[Vince Guaraldi with the San Francisco Boys Chorus]]''.&lt;ref name=Bangtimeline/&gt;

== Compositions for Charles Schulz's ''Peanuts'' ==
[[File:Peanuts gang.png|thumb|250px|left|Guaraldi composed music scores for the first sixteen ''Peanuts'' television specials plus one feature film and was responsible for their signature theme, &quot;[[Linus and Lucy]]&quot;]]In 1963, while searching for music to accompany a planned ''Peanuts'' documentary entitled ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1963 film)|A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]'', television producer [[Lee Mendelson]] heard &quot;Cast Your Fate to the Wind&quot; on the radio while driving home from a meeting with ''Peanuts'' creator [[Charles M. Schulz]].&lt;ref name=Schudel&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schudel |first1=Matt |title=Charlie Brown,' an Evergreen Treat |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/08/AR2006120800317.html |access-date=21 December 2019 |work=The Washington Post |publisher=The Washington Post Company |date=10 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendelson then contacted Ralph J. Gleason, who put him in touch with Guaraldi. Mendelson offered Guaraldi the job of composing several jazz scores for the documentary, which Guaraldi gladly accepted.&lt;ref name=BangLiner&gt;Bang, Derrick. [http://www.kritzerland.com/KR_Charlie_Brown_Notes.pdf Liner notes for ''A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' (2017); Kritzerland, Inc.] Retrieved 7 May 2020&lt;/ref&gt; Within several weeks, Mendelson received a call from an excited Guaraldi who wanted to play a piece of music he had just written. Mendelson, not wanting his first exposure to the new music to be marred by the poor audio qualities of a telephone, suggested coming over to Guaraldi’s studio. Guaraldi enthusiastically refused, saying &quot;I’ve got to play this for someone right now or I’ll explode!&quot; He then begun playing the yet-untitled &quot;[[Linus and Lucy]]&quot; for Mendelson, who agreed the song was perfect for Schulz’s ''Peanuts'' characters.&lt;ref name=BangLiner/&gt;

The documentary soundtrack, entitled ''[[Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]'', was recorded by Guaraldi's current trio (with bassist [[Monty Budwig]] and drummer [[Colin Bailey (drummer)|Colin Bailey]]) in October 1964 and released in December of that year. Although the documentary was ultimately shelved due to Mendelson's inability to secure sponsorship, Schulz and Mendelson retained Guaraldi for the upcoming ''Peanuts'' Christmas special, ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' (1965). The [[A Charlie Brown Christmas (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] was recorded by the Vince Guaraldi Trio, this time featuring  drummer [[Jerry Granelli]] and bassist Fred Marshall, and contained the songs &quot;[[Christmas Time Is Here]]&quot;, &quot;Skating&quot; and &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot;. Both the seasonal television special and accompanying soundtrack were very successful.&lt;ref name=linerPumpkin/&gt;

Derrick Bang, Guaraldi historian and author of ''Vince Guaraldi at the Piano'', commented that, &quot;the importance of ''Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown'' and its successor, the score to the Christmas special, cannot be overstated; rarely has an entertainment icon been so quickly—and firmly—welded to a musical composition...indeed, to an entire body of work from one individual. Guaraldi defined the ''Peanuts'' sound, and it's just as true today as it was in the 1960s. The compositions themselves are uniformly sparkling; it's as if the jazz pianist and his trio were waiting for this precise inspiration.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bang/&gt;

All involved with the project initially regarded the stunning success of ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' as something of a one-time fluke, but the second official ''Peanuts'' television special—''[[Charlie Brown's All Stars!]]''—was televised in June 1966 to similarly high ratings and acclaim.&lt;ref name=linerPumpkin/&gt; It was at this point that Schulz, Mendelson and animator [[Bill Melendez]] focused on creating another holiday blockbuster in the vein of ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'', eventually titled ''[[It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown]]''. Guaraldi spent most of summer 1966 composing cues for the Halloween-themed special, strongly encouraging Mendelson to consider making &quot;Linus and Lucy,&quot; which had been featured prominently in the Christmas special, the unofficial ''Peanuts'' theme. Guaraldi did not include the song in the music score for ''Charlie Brown's All Stars!'' and worked to correct that oversight by featuring it throughout ''It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown''.&lt;ref name=linerPumpkin/&gt; Melendez responded to Guaraldi's suggestion by beginning the special with a lengthy [[cold open]] sequence sans dialogue, employing only music and sound effects to convey Linus and Lucy's search for a pumpkin. Guaraldi recorded a fresh version of &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; for the opening sequence as a sextet, featuring Budwig and Bailey, as well as trumpeter [[Mannie Klein|Emmanuel Klein]], guitarist John Gray, and flautist [[Ronnie Lang]]. Lang's flute counterpoint was featured throughout the new version of &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot;, resulting in the song ultimately becoming the ''Peanuts'' franchise signature melody.&lt;ref name=linerPumpkin&gt;Bang, Derrick; Liner notes from ''[[It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown: Music from the Soundtrack]]'' (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

Guaraldi went on to compose scores for thirteen additional ''Peanuts'' television specials, as well as the 1969 feature film ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]''.&lt;ref name=Schudel/&gt; Despite the wealth of ''Peanuts'' material Guaraldi recorded, only ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' and ''A Boy Named Charlie Brown'' (both the unaired documentary and feature film) received official soundtrack releases during his lifetime.

&quot;I have always felt that one of the key elements that made ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' was the music,&quot; said Mendelson in 2010. &quot;It gave it a contemporary sound that appealed to all ages. Although Vince had never scored anything else and although I was basically a documentary film maker at the time, we started to work together on the cues because we both loved jazz and we both played the piano. So he would bring in the material for each scene and we would go over it scene by scene. Most of the time, the music worked perfectly. But there were times we would either not use something or use it somewhere else. We went through this same process on all sixteen shows. Although there was always some left over music, most of the time what he wrote and performed is what went on the air.&quot;&lt;ref name=liner/&gt;

==Later years==
Guaraldi's final three albums released during his lifetime were recorded for [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] after spending nearly two years trying to extricate himself from [[Fantasy Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic&quot;&gt;{{AllMusic | class= album | id= mw0003178168 | title= ''The Complete Warner Bros.–Seven Arts Recordings'' | first= Thom | last= Jurek | accessdate = 19 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner signed Guaraldi to a three-record deal in early 1968, insisting that his inaugural release consist of ''Peanuts'' material. This was done in part to fill the void left by a lack of soundtrack albums to accompany the successful television specials, ''[[Charlie Brown's All Stars!]]'', ''[[It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown]]'', ''[[You're in Love, Charlie Brown]]'' and ''[[He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown]]''. Guaraldi responded with new renditions of eight of his most popular scores from those programs on his first release, ''[[Oh Good Grief!]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic&quot;/&gt;

Guaraldi was then given complete artistic control over his sophomore, self-produced Warner effort, ''[[The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi]]'', resulting in an unfocused and overindulgent album that was not well received by both critics and consumers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot; /&gt; At Warner's insistence, arranger [[Shorty Rogers]] was recruited to produce Guaraldi's final album, ''[[Alma-Ville]]''. Though deemed a focused improvement over the previous album, Warner did not promote the album, ultimately choosing to not retain Guaraldi at the end of their three-record deal. Both ''The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi'' and ''Alma-Ville'' gradually fell into obscurity, while ''Oh Good Grief!'' remained a steady seller due to the perpetual popularity of the ''Peanuts'' franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot; /&gt;

After working on the soundtrack for the ''Peanuts'' feature film ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown (soundtrack)#A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]'', Guaraldi ceased releasing any new material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot; /&gt; In his review of ''[[The Complete Warner Bros.–Seven Arts Recordings]]'', ''The Recoup'' critic Joseph Kyle lamented, &quot;frustrated and unable to secure a record deal, he spent the remainder of his life as a live performer, recording more soundtrack material, and banking on the goodwill his ''Peanuts'' compositions earned him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Joseph | last = Kyle |title= Vince Guaraldi: The Complete Warner Bros.–Seven Arts Recordings (Omnivore) |work= therecoup.com|date= October 3, 2018 |url = https://therecoup.com/2018/10/03/vince-guaraldi-the-complete-warner-bros-seven-arts-recordings-omnivore/ | access-date = 19 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guaraldi's sound also evolved into a more fusion jazz/rock sound, as he largely traded the piano for [[List of Hammond organs#Tonewheel organs|Hammond B-3]] and [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes]] electric keyboards. His live performances included musicians who specialized in funk and soul as well as traditional jazz.&lt;ref name=aajazz/&gt; Posthumous releases ''[[Oaxaca (album)|Oaxaca]]'' (recorded in 1971) and ''[[Live on the Air]]'' (recorded in February 1974) feature live performances recorded during this period of transition.&lt;ref name=aajazz&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.allaboutjazz.com/oaxaca-vince-guaraldi-self-produced-review-by-david-rickert.php |title= Vince Guaraldi: ''Oaxaca'' |last= Rickert |first= David |date= November 18, 2004 |website= allaboutjazz.com |publisher= All About Jazz |access-date= 7 May 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt;

All ''Peanuts'' soundtracks scored after ''[[Play It Again, Charlie Brown#Music score|Play It Again, Charlie Brown]]'' (1971) feature Guaraldi favoring electric keyboards over traditional piano as well. ''[[You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown#Music score|You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown]]'' (1975), Guaraldi's penultimate music score, fused his fusion jazz style with the funk, disco and pop music that was popular at the time coupled with the use of the [[ARP String Ensemble]] synthesizer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt;

Guaraldi biographer and historian Derrick Bang put the musician's later years in perspective, saying, &quot;As jazz clubs were closing in the 1960s, with the advent of [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]]—a development that put many jazz musicians out of work—Guaraldi embraced the enemy, adjusting his style and approach to include electric keyboards. By the mid-'70s, he had become a respected veteran in what remained of the declining Northern California jazz club scene.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fivecentsplease.org/dpb/guaraldi.html |title= Jazz Impressions of Vince Guaraldi |last= Bang |first=Derrick |website= fivecentsplease.org |publisher= Derrick Bang, Scott McGuire  |access-date= 6 July 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of wealth Guaraldi accumulated from his perpetual ''Peanuts'' scoring opportunities plus royalties from previous work allowed him to live comfortably in [[Mill Valley, California]]. His desire to continually perform at small, local clubs was not due to financial necessity but because he wanted it like that. The monumental success garnered from his ''Peanuts'' work resulted in lucrative offers coming in from all over the U.S., all of which he declined. &quot;Once the ''Peanuts'' music became famous, Vince could have gone out and done a whole lot more,&quot; Mendelson said. &quot;But he was very provincial; he loved San Francisco, and he liked hanging out and playing at the local clubs. He never branched out from there; he never really wanted to. He'd get offers, but he'd tell me, 'I just want to do this; I'm having a good time, and I'm satisfied with it'.&quot; Eddie Duran concurred, saying, &quot;he did talk at times about moving to Los Angeles, but I think he really dug staying in the area, because he was sure of himself. When you're sure of where you are as an artist, you don't seek to go other places and prove it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt;

== Death and impact==
Guaraldi died suddenly at age 47 on February 6, 1976,&lt;ref name=jzpvgdaafs&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=95MzAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5750%2C3338075 |newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel |location=California |agency=UPI |title=Jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi dies at age 47 |date=February 9, 1976 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; after suffering a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. The evening before, he had dined at Mendelson's home and was reportedly not feeling well, complaining of indigestion-like chest discomfort. &quot;He was about to do his first cruise. He'd be able to play ''Peanuts'' music on the ship, and he was excited about that. We talked about the cruise and the ''Peanuts'' shows, and I said that I didn't know what the next one would be yet, but that we wouldn't start until he got back. But he also said he wasn't feeling well, and had gone to see the doctor. The doctor thought Vince might have a [[diaphragmatic hernia]], and that they might have to deal with it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt; 

The following morning, on February 6, Guaraldi awoke with a bad cold and remained in bed throughout the day. That afternoon, Guaraldi finished recording the soundtrack for ''[[It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown]]'' at [[Wally Heider Studios]] with bassist Seward McCain and drummer Jim Zimmerman. &quot;We had just come back from a concert we did up in the mountain,&quot; recalled Zimmerman, &quot;and Vince had been skiing, and up there carrying on like nothing was bothering him. But once we were back in the studio, he started complaining that his stomach was bothering him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt;

That evening, after concluding the first set at Butterfield's Nightclub in [[Menlo Park, California]], with his interpretation of the Beatles' &quot;[[Eleanor Rigby]]&quot;, Guaraldi and Zimmerman returned to the room in which they were staying that weekend at the adjacent Red Cottage Inn, to relax before the next set. Zimmerman commented, &quot;Vince was feeling sick to his stomach. He got up to go to the bathroom...and went down on the floor. I tried to bring him around but wasn't successful. It happened so fast.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt; McCain commented, &quot;Vince headed for the bathroom but never made it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saberpoint.blogspot.com/2009/02/searching-for-answers-death-of-vince.html &quot;Searching for Answers: the Death of Vince Guaraldi, February 7, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; When Vince fell and hit the floor, Jim [Zimmerman] got me. We went back and tried to revive him, but it didn't work.&quot;&lt;ref name=keyboard&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bob Doerschuk | date = July 1981 | title = Vince Guaraldi: Remembering the Man Behind 'Cast Your Fate to the Wind'| url = http://www.georgewinston.com/userfiles/files/Vince%20Guaraldi%20-%20Keyboard%20Magazine.pdf | journal = [[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]] | pages = 12–19 | access-date = 3 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guaraldi was rushed to [[Stanford University Medical Center|Stanford Hospital]] where he was pronounced dead on arrival at 11:07 P.M.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite news | title = Jazz Artist Guaraldi Succumbs | work = San Mateo Times | date = February 7, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official cause of death was certified as &quot;acute myocardial infarction, due to or as a consequence of coronary arteriosclerosis with [[thrombosis]] and generalized [[arteriosclerosis]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt; 

Pianist George DeQuattro recalled years later, &quot;I saw him about a week before he passed away. Vince seemed really fine. But he had seen a doctor because he had stomach problems, and was feeling ill and tired. The doctor told him it might just be [[Peptic ulcer disease|ulcers]], and prescribed some dumb medicine and told him to forget about it. But it wasn't that, and it's really a shame. That would never happen today.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt; In his 2012 biography, ''Vince Guaraldi at the Piano'', author Derrick Bang wrote, &quot;as time passed, Guaraldi's friends, family and colleagues would begin to wonder if a [[Abdominal aortic aneurysm|stomach aneurysm]]—or something else—had played a role in that heart attack,&quot; adding that Guaraldi's &quot;complaint of a painful stomach ache clearly hadn't been taken seriously enough.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt;

Guaraldi's death was a blow to his friends, family and colleagues. &quot;It was totally unexpected,&quot; said Mendelson.&lt;ref name=Making/&gt; &quot;The day before the funeral, Carmella [Guaraldi's mother] called and said that they wanted to use the ''Peanuts'' music. I said, oh, God, I don't think that's a good idea. I begged her not to do it, but she was a strong woman. And they did play it, and I just fell apart; everybody broke up. She was sitting right behind me. I guess it was the right thing to do, but that made the funeral very hard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt; It was not an easy day; he was so young. It was one of the saddest days of my life.&quot;&lt;ref name=Making/&gt; ''Peanuts'' animator [[Bill Melendez|Bill Meléndez]] added, &quot;He was a real good guy and we miss him.&quot;&lt;ref name=Making&gt;{{cite book | last = Mendelson|  first = Lee | author-link = Lee Mendelson | author2 = Bill Melendez | title = A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition | publisher = [[HarperCollins]] | year = 2000 | pages = 91 | isbn = 0-0622-7214-4 | url = https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062272140/a-charlie-brown-christmas/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;I was in New York, and [[Vince Lateano]] told me,&quot; said drummer [[Mike Clark (jazz musician)|Mike Clark]] in 2010. &quot;It was the last thing I could think of, that Guaraldi would die. It blew my mind. I'm still saddened, when I think of him, because he was such an ''energized'' person, and he seemed to have an endless supply of good fortune. It seemed everything he touched turned into money or opportunity. I simply couldn't believe it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt;

Rev. Charles Gompertz, who invited Guaraldi to [[At Grace Cathedral|perform at Grace Cathedral]] in 1965, commented in 1981, &quot;I think part of Vince's problem was that he never really took very good care of himself. He stayed out late, he smoked, and he did a whole lot of things. He tried everything. I mean, when skateboards first came out, he was the first kid on his block to get one, only as a kid he happened to be about 30. He pushed himself to the limit, whether musically or physically. He saw himself as a very youthful person, but he didn't do any of the physical things you have to do to prepare yourself to live like that.&quot; His mother Carmella Guaraldi added, &quot;When it happened down at Butterfield's, when the end finally came, he went the way he would have wanted to go, with the piano.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=keyboard/&gt;

Guaraldi is buried at [[Holy Cross Cemetery (Colma, California)|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Colma, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt;

==Personal==
Guaraldi married high school girlfriend Shirley Moskowitz on February 1, 1953. She initially filed for divorce on April 21, 1966, citing &quot;extreme cruelty.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bangtimeline/&gt; Their divorce was not finalized until December 8, 1970.&lt;ref name=marinIJ&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.marinij.com/2012/05/25/lib-at-large-new-biography-focuses-on-marins-unsung-jazzman-guaraldi/ |newspaper= [[Marin Independent Journal]] |last= Liberatore | first = Paul |title= New biography focuses on Marin's unsung jazzman Guaraldi |date= May 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The union produced two children: David Anthony Guaraldi (b. August 11, 1955) and Dia Lisa (b. February 16, 1960).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot; /&gt; Guaraldi also had a long-term affair with Gretchen Katamay, with whom he appeared on the cover of his 1964 album, ''[[The Latin Side of Vince Guaraldi]]''.&lt;ref name=marinIJ/&gt;

== Legacy ==
A book-length biography of Guaraldi was published in March 2012. ''Vince Guaraldi at the Piano'', by author and Guaraldi archivist Derrick Bang, chronicles Guaraldi's career and role in the Northern California jazz scene, and also includes a complete discography and filmography, as well as an appendix of quotations from Guaraldi's former sidemen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot; /&gt;

Jazz musician [[David Benoit (musician)|David Benoit]] has often credited Guaraldi and the ''Charlie Brown Christmas'' soundtrack for his interest in jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Benoit |first1=David |title=About |url=https://benoit.com/about-david/ |website=David Benoit website |access-date=21 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Benoit recorded a cover of Guaraldi's &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; for an album called ''[[This Side Up (David Benoit album)|This Side Up]]'', which enjoyed considerable radio airplay and helped launch the [[Smooth jazz|smooth jazz]] genre. He released &quot;Cast Your Fate to the Wind&quot; on the album ''[[Waiting for Spring]]'' in 1989.

Pianist [[George Winston]] released a Guaraldi tribute album in 1996 titled ''[[Linus and Lucy – The Music of Vince Guaraldi]]''.&lt;ref name=pphtgua&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w6lJAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6164%2C1041315 |newspaper=Bangor Daily News |location=Maine |last=McGarrigle |first=Dale |title=Pianist pays homage to Guaraldi |date=October 19, 1996 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pcfwust&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gJcyAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5049%2C2541825 |newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World |location=Kansas |agency=The Mag |last=Biles |first=Jan |title=Pianist casts fate with unique style |date=September 5, 1996 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ptpcomp&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=10scAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5077%2C1755183 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |agency=(Kansas City Star) |last=Beauchamp |first=Lane |title=Pianist tackles 'Peanuts' composer |date=September 12, 1996 |page=8B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winston performed many ''Peanuts'' songs that had not been released by Guaraldi. &quot;I love his melodies and his [[chord progression]]s&quot;, Winston said of Guaraldi. &quot;He has a really personal way of doing [[Voicing (music)|voicings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first= Tina |last= Maples |title= Music Just Happens To Winston |newspaper= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | date= November 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; His music is part of our culture and we know it even if we don’t know Vince. He had three bags: the Latin, the ''Peanuts'', and the impressionistic 'Cast Your Fate to the Wind' stuff. And those three bags are all his.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://concord.com/artist/vince-guaraldi/ Vince Guaraldi at ''concord.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; The album was very successful, leading Winston to record a follow-up, titled ''[[Love Will Come – The Music of Vince Guaraldi, Volume 2]]'', released in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgewinston.com/recent-projects.php|title=Recent Projects at George Winston official website|website=Georgewinston.com|access-date=July 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205185344/http://georgewinston.com/recent-projects.php|archive-date=February 5, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

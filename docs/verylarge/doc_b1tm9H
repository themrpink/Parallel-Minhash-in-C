Piracy in the Caribbean declined for the next several decades after 1730, but by the 1810s many pirates roamed the waters though they were not as bold or successful as their predecessors. The most successful pirates of the era were [[Jean Lafitte]] and [[Roberto Cofresi]]. Lafitte is considered by many to be the last [[buccaneer]] due to his army of pirates and fleet of pirate ships which held bases in and around the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Lafitte and his men participated in the [[War of 1812]] [[Battle of New Orleans (1815)|battle of New Orleans]]. Cofresi's base was in [[Mona Island]], Puerto Rico, from where he disrupted the commerce throughout the region. He became the last major target of the international anti-piracy operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wombwell |first=A.

The elimination of piracy from European waters expanded to the Caribbean in the 18th century, West Africa and North America by the 1710s and by the 1720s even the [[Indian Ocean]] was a difficult location for pirates to operate.

England began to strongly turn against piracy at the turn of the 18th century, as it was increasingly damaging to the country's economic and commercial prospects in the region. The [[Piracy Act 1698|Piracy Act of 1698]] for the &quot;more effectual suppression of Piracy&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''William III, 1698–99: An Act for the more effectual suppression of Piracy''. [Chapter VII. Rot. Parl. 11 Gul. III. p. 2. n. 5.]', Statutes of the Realm: volume 7: 1695–1701 (1820), pp. 590–94. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=46966. Date accessed: February 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; made it easier to capture, try and convict pirates by lawfully enabling acts of piracy to be &quot;examined, inquired of, tried, heard and determined, and adjudged in any place at sea, or upon the land, in any of his Majesty's islands, plantations, colonies, dominions, forts, or factories.&quot; This effectively enabled admirals to hold a court session to hear the trials of pirates in any place they deemed necessary, rather than requiring that the trial be held in England. Commissioners of these vice-admiralty courts were also vested with &quot;full power and authority&quot; to issue warrants, summon the necessary witnesses, and &quot;to do all thing necessary for the hearing and final determination of any case of piracy, robbery, or felony.&quot; These new and faster trials provided no legal representation for the pirates; and ultimately led in this era to the execution of 600 pirates, which represented approximately 10 percent of the pirates active at the time in the Caribbean region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Max 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boot |first=Max |author-link=Max Boot |title=Pirates, Then and Now |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=88 |number=4 |year=2009 |pages=94–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being an accessory to piracy was also criminalised under the statute.

Piracy saw a brief resurgence between the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 and around 1720, as many unemployed seafarers took to piracy as a way to make ends meet when a surplus of sailors after the war led to a decline in wages and working conditions. At the same time, one of the terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] that ended the war gave to Great Britain's [[Royal African Company]] and other British slavers a thirty-year asiento, or contract, to furnish African slaves to the Spanish colonies, providing British merchants and smugglers potential inroads into the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America and leading to an economic revival for the whole region. This revived Caribbean trade provided rich new pickings for a wave of piracy. Also contributing to the increase of Caribbean piracy at this time was Spain's breakup of the English logwood settlement at [[Campeche]] and the attractions of a freshly sunken silver fleet off the southern Bahamas in 1715. Fears over the rising levels of crime and piracy, political discontent, concern over crowd behaviour at public punishments, and an increased determination by [[Parliament of Great Britain|parliament]] to suppress piracy, resulted in the [[Piracy Act 1717|Piracy Act of 1717]] and of [[Piracy Act 1721|1721]]. These established a seven-year [[penal transportation]] to [[North America]] as a possible punishment for those convicted of lesser felonies, or as a possible sentence that [[capital punishment]] might be commuted to by royal [[pardon]].

After 1720, piracy in the classic sense became extremely rare as increasingly effective anti-piracy measures were taken by the Royal Navy making it impossible for any pirate to pursue an effective career for long. By 1718, the British Royal Navy had approximately 124 vessels and 214 by 1815; a big increase from the two vessels England had possessed in 1670.&lt;ref name=&quot;Max 2009&quot;/&gt; British Royal Navy warships tirelessly hunted down pirate vessels, and almost always won these engagements.

Many pirates did not surrender and were killed at the point of capture; notorious pirate Edward Teach, or &quot;Blackbeard&quot;, was hunted down by [[Lieutenant]] Robert Maynard at [[Cape Lookout National Seashore|Ocracoke Inlet]] off the coast of [[North Carolina]] on November 22, 1718 and killed. His flagship was a captured French slave ship known originally as &quot;La Concorde&quot;, he renamed the frigate ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''. Captain [[Chaloner Ogle]] of HMS ''Swallow'' cornered Bartholomew Roberts in 1722 at Cape Lopez, and a fatal broadside from the Swallow killed the pirate captain instantly. Roberts' death shocked the pirate world, as well as the Royal Navy. The local merchants and civilians had thought him invincible, and some considered him a hero.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pike1876&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pike|first=Luke Owen|title=A History of Crime in England: From the accession of Henry VII to the present time|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorycrimein03pikegoog|year=1876|publisher=Smith, Elder &amp; Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/ahistorycrimein03pikegoog/page/n286 266]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts' death was seen by many historians as the end of the Golden Age of Piracy. Also crucial to the end of this era of piracy was the loss of the pirates' last Caribbean safe haven at Nassau.

In the early 19th century, piracy along the East and Gulf Coasts of North America as well as in the Caribbean increased again. Jean Lafitte was just one of hundreds of pirates operating in American and Caribbean waters between the years of 1820 and 1835. The United States Navy repeatedly engaged pirates in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and in the Mediterranean. Cofresí's ''El Mosquito'' was disabled in [[Capture of the El Mosquito|a collaboration]] between Spain and the United States. After fleeing for hours, he was ambushed and captured inland. The United States landed shore parties on several islands in the Caribbean in pursuit of pirates; Cuba was a major haven. By the 1830s piracy had died out again, and the navies of the region focused on the slave trade.

About the time of the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1846, the United States Navy had grown strong and numerous enough to eliminate the pirate threat in the West Indies. By the 1830s, ships had begun to convert to steam propulsion, so the [[Age of Sail]] and the classical idea of pirates in the Caribbean ended. Privateering, similar to piracy, continued as an asset in war for a few more decades and proved to be of some importance during the naval campaigns of the [[American Civil War]].

Privateering would remain a tool of European states until the mid-19th century's [[Declaration of Paris]]. But [[letters of marque]] were given out much more sparingly by governments and were terminated as soon as conflicts ended. The idea of &quot;no peace beyond the Line&quot; was a relic that had no meaning by the more settled late 18th and early 19th centuries.

===North America===
[[File:Dan Seavey around 1920.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Seavey]] was a pirate on the [[Great Lakes]] in the early 20th century.]]

Piracy on the east coast of North America first became common in the early seventeenth century, as English privateers discharged after the end of the [[Anglo-Spanish_War_(1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War]] (1585-1604) turned to piracy.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Malcolm Senior, [https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/34506574/544142.pdf An Investigation of the Activities and Importance of English Pirates, 1603-40] (University of Bristol, PhD thesis, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clive Senior, ''A Nation of Pirates: English Piracy in its Heyday'' (Newton Abbot, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous and successful of these early pirates was [[Peter Easton]].

[[River pirate|River piracy]], in late 18th-mid-19th century America, was primarily concentrated along the [[Ohio River]] and [[Mississippi River]] valleys. In 1803, at [[Grand Tower, Illinois|Tower Rock]], the [[U.S. Army]] [[cavalry|dragoons]], possibly, from the frontier army post up river at [[Fort Kaskaskia State Historic Site|Fort Kaskaskia]], on the [[Illinois]] side opposite St. Louis, raided and drove out the river pirates.

[[Stack Island (Mississippi River)|Stack Island]] was also associated with river pirates and [[counterfeit money|counterfeiters]] in the late 1790s. In 1809, the last major river pirate activity took place, on the Upper Mississippi River, and river piracy in this area came to an abrupt end, when a group of [[flatboat]]men raided the island, wiping out the river pirates. From 1790 to 1834, [[Cave-In-Rock, Illinois|Cave-In-Rock]] was the principal [[outlaw]] lair and headquarters of river pirate activity in the Ohio River region, from which [[Samuel Mason]] led a gang of river pirates on the Ohio River.

River piracy continued on the lower Mississippi River, from the early 1800s to the mid-1830s, declining as a result of direct military action and local [[law enforcement]] and [[vigilante|regulator-vigilante]] groups that uprooted and swept out pockets of outlaw resistance.

[[Dan Seavey|&quot;Roaring&quot; Dan Seavey]] was a pirate active in the early 1900s on the Great Lakes.

Pirates had a system of hierarchy on board their ships determining how captured money was distributed. However, pirates were more [[egalitarian]] than any other area of employment at the time. In fact, pirate [[quartermaster]]s were a counterbalance to the captain and had the power to veto his orders. The majority of plunder was in the form of cargo and ship's equipment, with medicines the most highly prized. A vessel's doctor's chest would be worth anywhere from £300 to £400, or around $470,000 in today's values. Jewels were common plunder but not popular, as they were hard to sell, and pirates, unlike the public of today, had little concept of their value. There is one case recorded where a pirate was given a large diamond worth a great deal more than the value of the handful of small diamonds given to his crewmates as a share. He felt cheated and had it broken up to match what they received.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vallar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cindyvallar.com/treasure.html|title=Treasure|access-date=April 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spanish dollar|Spanish pieces of eight]] minted in Mexico or Seville were the standard trade currency in the American colonies. However, every colony still used the monetary units of pounds, shillings, and pence for bookkeeping while Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese money were all standard mediums of exchange as British law prohibited the export of British silver coinage. Until the exchange rates were standardised in the late 18th century each colony legislated its own different exchange rates. In England, 1 piece of eight was worth 4s 3d while it was worth 8s in New York, 7s 6d in [[Pennsylvania]] and 6s 8d in [[Virginia]]. One 18th-century English shilling was worth around $58 in modern currency, so a piece of eight could be worth anywhere from $246 to $465. As such, the value of pirate plunder could vary considerably, depending on who recorded it and where.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hudsonrivervalley.net/AMERICANBOOK/18.html|title=The Hudson River Valley Institute|access-date=April 20, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302075626/http://www.hudsonrivervalley.net/AMERICANBOOK/18.html|archive-date=March 2, 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCurrency/CurrencyIntros/IntroValue.html|title=University of Notre Dame|access-date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary seamen received a part of the plunder at the captain's discretion but usually a single share. On average, a pirate could expect the equivalent of a year's wages as his share from each ship captured while the crew of the most successful pirates would often each receive a share valued at around £1,000 ($1.17&amp;nbsp;million) at least once in their career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vallar&quot;/&gt; One of the larger amounts taken from a single ship was that by captain Thomas Tew from an Indian merchantman in 1692. Each ordinary seaman on his ship received a share worth £3,000 ($3.5&amp;nbsp;million), with officers receiving proportionally larger amounts as per the agreed shares, with Tew himself receiving 2½ shares. It is known there were actions with multiple ships captured where a single share was worth almost double this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vallar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gosse&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last= Gosse|first= Philip |title= The Pirates' Who's Who|publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC|year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4346-3302-6}} p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, an ordinary seamen in the Royal Navy received 19s per month to be paid in a lump sum at the end of a tour of duty, which was around half the rate paid in the [[Merchant Navy]]. However, corrupt officers would often &quot;tax&quot; their crews' wage to supplement their own, and the Royal Navy of the day was infamous for its reluctance to pay. From this wage, 6d per month was deducted for the maintenance of [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]], with similar amounts deducted for the [[Chatham Chest]], the chaplain and [[surgeon]]. Six months' pay was withheld to discourage desertion. That this was insufficient incentive is revealed in a report on proposed changes to the RN [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] wrote in 1803; he noted that since 1793 more than 42,000 sailors had deserted. Roughly half of all RN crews were [[Impressment|pressganged]] and these not only received lower wages than volunteers but were shackled while the vessel was docked and were never permitted to go ashore until released from service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last= Hill|first= J.R. |title= The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002 |isbn=0-19-860527-7}} p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Royal Navy suffered from many morale issues, it answered the question of prize money via the 'Cruizers and Convoys' Act of 1708 which handed over the share previously gained by the Crown to the captors of the ship. Technically it was still possible for the Crown to get the money or a portion of it but this rarely happened. The process of condemnation of a captured vessel and its cargo and men was given to the High Court of the Admiralty and this was the process which remained in force with minor changes throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

Even the flag officer's share was not quite straightforward; he would only get the full one-eighth if he had no junior flag officer beneath him. If this was the case then he would get a third share. If he had more than one then he would take one half while the rest was shared out equally.

There was a great deal of money to be made in this way. The record breaker was the capture of the [[Spanish frigate Hermione|Spanish frigate ''Hermione'']], which was carrying treasure in 1762. The value of this was so great that each individual seaman netted £485 ($1.4&amp;nbsp;million in 2008 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ Current value] is based on the average annual income for the respective years.&lt;/ref&gt; The two captains responsible, Evans and Pownall, received £65,000 each ($188.4&amp;nbsp;million). In January 1807 the frigate ''Caroline'' took the Spanish ''San Rafael'', which brought in £52,000 for her captain, Peter Rainier (who had been only a midshipman some thirteen months before). All through the wars there are examples of this kind of luck falling on captains. Another famous 'capture' was that of the Spanish frigates ''Thetis'' and ''Santa Brigada'', which were loaded with gold [[Coin|specie]]. They were taken by four British frigates who shared the money, each captain receiving £40,730. Each lieutenant got £5,091, the Warrant Officer group, £2,468, the midshipmen £791 and the individual seamen £182.

It should also be noted that it was usually only the frigates which took prizes; the ships of the line were far too ponderous to be able to chase and capture the smaller ships which generally carried treasure. Nelson always bemoaned that he had done badly out of prize money and even as a flag officer received little. This was not that he had a bad command of captains but rather that British mastery of the seas was so complete that few enemy ships dared to sail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavyprize.htm Nelson and His Navy – Prize Money] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621024038/http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavyprize.htm |date=June 21, 2008 }} Historical Maritime Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loot===
[[File:Whydah-gold.jpg|thumb|right|Pirate treasure looted by [[Samuel Bellamy]] and recovered from the wreck of the ''Whydah''; exhibit at the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]], 2010]]
Even though pirates raided many ships, few, if any, buried their treasure. Often, the &quot;treasure&quot; that was stolen was food, water, alcohol, weapons, or clothing. Other things they stole were household items like bits of soap and gear like rope and anchors, or sometimes they would keep the ship they captured (either to sell off or keep because it was better than their ship). Such items were likely to be needed immediately, rather than saved for future trade. For this reason, there was no need for the pirates to bury these goods. Pirates tended to kill few people aboard the ships they captured; usually they would kill no one if the ship surrendered, because if it became known that pirates took no prisoners, their victims would fight to the last breath and make victory both very difficult and costly in lives.  In contrast, ships would quickly surrender if they knew they would be spared. In one well-documented case 300 heavily armed soldiers on a ship attacked by Thomas Tew surrendered after a brief battle with none of Tew's 40-man crew being injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://piratesofamerica.com/Pirates_of_America/Thomas_Tew.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927040642/http://piratesofamerica.com/Pirates_of_America/Thomas_Tew.html|url-status=dead|title=Piratesofamerica.com|archive-date=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punishment===
[[File:Henszlein.jpg|thumb|A contemporary flyer depicting the [[public execution]] of 16th-century pirate [[Klein Henszlein]] and his crew in 1573]]
During the 17th and 18th centuries, once pirates were caught, justice was meted out in a summary fashion, and many ended their lives by &quot;dancing the hempen jig&quot;, a euphemism for [[hanging]]. Public execution was a form of entertainment at the time, and people came out to watch them as they would to a sporting event today. Newspapers reported details such as condemned men's last words, the prayers said by the priests, and descriptions of their final moments in the gallows. In England most of these executions took place at [[Execution Dock]] on the [[River Thames]] in London.

In the cases of more famous prisoners, usually captains, their punishments extended beyond death. Their bodies were enclosed in [[gibbeting|iron cages (gibbet)]] (for which they were measured before their execution) and left to swing in the air until the flesh rotted off them- a process that could take as long as two years. The bodies of captains such as William &quot;Captain&quot; Kidd, Charles Vane, [[William Fly]], and [[Jack Rackham|Jack Rackham (&quot;Calico Jack&quot;)]] were all treated this way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pirates by John Matthews&quot;&gt;Pirates by John Matthews&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of women===
{{Main|Women in piracy}}

While piracy was predominantly a male occupation throughout history, a minority of pirates were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pantherbay.com/bio_womenpirates.php|title=Were there really women pirates?|website=www.pantherbay.com|access-date=November 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428233752/http://www.pantherbay.com/bio_womenpirates.php|archive-date=April 28, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pirates did not allow women onto their ships very often. Additionally, women were often regarded as bad luck among pirates. It was feared that the male members of the crew would argue and fight over the women. On many ships, women (as well as young boys) were prohibited by the [[Pirate code|ship's contract]], which all crew members were required to sign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pennell&quot;&gt;Pennell, C.

Because of the resistance to allowing women on board, many female pirates did not identify themselves as such. Anne Bonny, for example, dressed and acted as a man while on Captain Calico Jack's ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pennell&quot;/&gt;{{rp|285}} She and [[Mary Read]], another female pirate, are often identified as being unique in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011|editor-last=Stock|editor-first=Jennifer|title=Life Aboard Ship in the Golden Age of Piracy|url=http://link.galegroup.com/GVRL?sid=GVRL&amp;xid=68fa0fbc|journal=Pirates Through the Ages Reference Library|volume=2|pages=117–135}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible many women dressed as men during the Golden Age of Piracy, in an effort to take advantage of the many rights, privileges, and freedoms that were exclusive to men.

===Democracy among Caribbean pirates===
{{See also|Pirate code|distribution of justice}}
Unlike traditional Western societies of the time, many Caribbean pirate crews of European descent operated as limited [[democracy|democracies]]. Pirate communities were some of the first to instate a system of checks and balances similar to the one used by the present-day United States and many other countries. The first record of such a government aboard a pirate sloop dates to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Leeson, Peter T.  &quot;An-arrghchy: The Law and Economics of Pirate Organization.&quot;  Journal of Political Economy 115, no. 6 (2007): 1049–1094. pg 1066 [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/526403 University of Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pirate Code===
As recorded by Captain Charles Johnson regarding the articles of Bartholomew Roberts.
{{bq|1=&lt;nowiki /&gt;
#Every man shall have an equal vote in affairs of moment. He shall have an equal title to the fresh provisions or strong liquors at any time seized, and shall use them at pleasure unless a scarcity may make it necessary for the common good that a retrenchment may be voted.
#Every man shall be called fairly in turn by the list on board of prizes, because over and above their proper share, they are allowed a shift of clothes. But if they defraud the company to the value of even one dollar in plate, jewels or money, they shall be [[marooning|marooned]]. If any man rob another he shall have his nose and ears slit, and be put ashore where he shall be sure to encounter hardships.
#None shall game for money either with dice or cards.
#The lights and candles should be put out at eight at night, and if any of the crew desire to drink after that hour they shall sit upon the open deck without lights.
#Each man shall keep his piece, cutlass and pistols at all times clean and ready for action.
#No boy or woman to be allowed amongst them. If any man shall be found seducing any of the latter sex and carrying her to sea in disguise he shall suffer death.
#He that shall desert the ship or his quarters in time of battle shall be punished by death or marooning.
#None shall strike another on board the ship, but every man's quarrel shall be ended on shore by sword or pistol in this manner. At the word of command from the quartermaster, each man being previously placed back to back, shall turn and fire immediately. If any man do not, the quartermaster shall knock the piece out of his hand. If both miss their aim they shall take to their cutlasses, and he that draw the first blood shall be declared the victor.
#No man shall talk of breaking up their way of living till each has a share of 1,000. Every man who shall become a cripple or lose a limb in the service shall have 800 pieces of eight from the common stock and for lesser hurts proportionately.
#The captain and the quartermaster shall each receive two shares of a prize, the master gunner and [[boatswain]], one and one half shares, all other officers one and one quarter, and private gentlemen of fortune one share each.

==Known pirate shipwrecks==
To date, the following identifiable pirate [[shipwrecks]] have been discovered:

*''[[Whydah Gally]]'' (discovered in 1984), a former slave ship seized on its maiden voyage from Africa by the pirate captain [[Black Sam Bellamy|&quot;Black Sam&quot; Bellamy]]. The wreck was found off the coast of [[Cape Cod]], Massachusetts, buried under {{convert|10|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|50|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} feet of sand, in depths ranging from {{convert|16|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} feet deep, spread for four miles, parallel to the Cape's easternmost coast. With the discovery of the ship's bell in 1985 and a small brass placard in 2013, both inscribed with the ship's name and maiden voyage date, the ''Whydah'' is the only fully authenticated Golden Age pirate shipwreck ever discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commonwealth of Massachusetts v.

*''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' (discovered in 1996), the flagship of the infamous pirate [[Blackbeard]]. He used the ship for less than a year, but it was an effective tool in his prize-taking. In June 1718, Blackbeard ran the ship aground at Topsail Inlet, now known as Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina.

==Privateers==
{{Main|Privateer}}
[[File:Rekonstruierter Schaedel.jpg|thumb|upright|Modern reconstruction of skull alleged to have belonged to 14th century pirate [[Klaus Störtebeker]]. He was the leader of the privateer guild [[Victual Brothers]], who later turned to piracy and roamed European seas.]]
A '''privateer''' or '''corsair''' used similar methods to a pirate, but acted under orders of the state while in possession of a commission or [[letter of marque]] and reprisal from a government or monarch authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation. For example, the [[United States Constitution]] of 1787 specifically authorized [[United States Congress|Congress]] to issue letters of marque and reprisal. The letter of marque and reprisal was recognized by international convention and meant that a privateer could not technically be charged with piracy while attacking the targets named in his commission. This nicety of law did not always save the individuals concerned, however, since whether one was considered a pirate or a legally operating privateer often depended on whose custody the individual found himself in—that of the country that had issued the commission, or that of the object of attack. Spanish authorities were known to execute foreign privateers with their letters of marque hung around their necks to emphasize Spain's rejection of such defenses. Furthermore, many privateers exceeded the bounds of their letters of marque by attacking nations with which their sovereign was at peace (Thomas Tew and William Kidd are notable alleged examples), and thus made themselves liable to conviction for piracy. However, a letter of marque did provide some cover for such pirates, as plunder seized from neutral or friendly shipping could be passed off later as taken from enemy merchants.

The famous Barbary Corsairs of the Mediterranean, authorized by the Ottoman Empire, were privateers, as were the Maltese Corsairs, who were authorized by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]], and the [[Dunkirkers]] in the service of the [[Spanish Empire]]. In the years 1626–1634 alone, the Dunkirk privateers captured 1,499 ships, and sank another 336.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gbU8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA229 The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 4, The Decline of Spain and the Thirty Years' War, 1609–48/49]''&quot;.

Privateers constituted a large proportion of the total military force at sea during the 17th and 18th centuries. During the [[Nine Years War]], the French adopted a policy of strongly encouraging privateers ([[French corsairs]]), including the famous [[Jean Bart]], to attack English and Dutch shipping. England lost roughly 4,000 merchant ships during the war.&lt;ref name=Privateer&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj11n1/cj11n1-8.pdf Privateering and the Private Production of Naval Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031211221516/http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj11n1/cj11n1-8.pdf |date=December 11, 2003 }}, ''Gary M.

Privateering lost international sanction under the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law|Declaration of Paris]] in 1856.

==Commerce raiders==
{{See also|Ruse de guerre}}
A wartime activity similar to piracy involves disguised [[warship]]s called [https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/commerce-raiders commerce raiders] or [[merchant raider]]s, which attack enemy shipping commerce, approaching by stealth and then opening fire. Commerce raiders operated successfully during the American Revolution.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} During the American Civil War, the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] sent out several commerce raiders, the most famous of which was the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} During World War I and World War II, Germany also made use of these tactics, both in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and Indian Oceans. Since commissioned naval vessels were openly used, these commerce raiders should not be considered even privateers, much less pirates—although the opposing combatants were vocal in denouncing them as such.

Seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue (with estimated worldwide losses of US$16&amp;nbsp;billion per year),&lt;ref name=&quot;foreignaffairs.org&quot;/&gt; particularly in the waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, off the Somali coast, and also in the [[Strait of Malacca]] and Singapore, which are used by over 50,000 commercial ships a year. In the Gulf of Guinea, maritime piracy has also led to pressure on offshore oil and gas production, providing security for offshore installations and supply vessels is often paid for by oil companies rather than the respective governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Nigeria, Angola and beyond – unlocking offshore potential requires a safe environment | url=https://www.academia.edu/9519102 | access-date=September 27, 2015 | work=Ship&amp;Offshore | first=Dirk | last=Siebels | date=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= U.S. Navy warships exchange gunfire with suspected pirates off Somali coast | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002874180_websomalia19.html?syndication=rss | access-date=January 18, 2007 | work=The Seattle Times | first=Jim | last=Krane | date=March 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the emergence of piracy off the coast of Somalia spurred a multi-national effort led by the United States to patrol the waters near the [[Horn of Africa]].

[[File:Somalian Piracy Threat Map 2010.png|thumb|left|Map showing the extent of Somali pirate attacks on shipping vessels between 2005 and 2010.]]

Modern pirates favor small boats and taking advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels. They also use large vessels to supply the smaller attack/boarding vessels. Modern pirates can be successful because a large amount of international commerce occurs via shipping. Major shipping routes take cargo ships through narrow bodies of water such as the [[Gulf of Aden]] and the Strait of Malacca making them vulnerable to be overtaken and boarded by small [[motorboat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2008/03/080303_pirates_prog2.shtml BBC Piracy documentary].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~ar120/somalia.html Piracy at Somalian coasts].&lt;/ref&gt; Other active areas include the [[South China Sea]] and the [[Niger Delta]]. As usage increases, many of these ships have to lower cruising speeds to allow for navigation and traffic control, making them prime targets for piracy.

Also, pirates often operate in regions of poor developing or struggling countries with small or nonexistent navies and large [[trade route]]s. Pirates sometimes evade capture by sailing into waters controlled by their pursuer's enemies. With the end of the [[Cold War]], navies have decreased in size and patrol less frequently, while trade has increased, making organized piracy far easier. Modern pirates are sometimes linked with organized-crime syndicates, but often are small individual groups.

The [[International Maritime Bureau]] (IMB) maintains statistics regarding pirate attacks dating back to 1995. Their records indicate hostage-taking overwhelmingly dominates the types of violence against seafarers. For example, in 2006, there were 239 attacks, 77 crew members were kidnapped and 188 taken hostage but only 15 of the pirate attacks resulted in murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securitymanagement.com/article/eastern-inscrutability-piracy-high-seas Security Management:Piracy on the high seas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103062657/http://www.securitymanagement.com/article/eastern-inscrutability-piracy-high-seas |date=January 3, 2008 }}. Retrieved October 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the attacks rose by 10 percent to 263 attacks. There was a 35 percent increase on reported attacks involving guns. Crew members that were injured numbered 64 compared to just 17 in 2006.&lt;ref name=ICC_piracy_report&gt;[http://www.icc-ccs.org/main/news.php?newsid=102 ICC Commercial Crime Services: IBM Piracy Report 2007].

Stanton had many educational opportunities as a young child. Their neighbor, Reverend Simon Hosack, taught her Greek and mathematics. Edward Bayard, her brother-in-law and Eleazar's former classmate at Union College, taught her philosophy and horsemanship. Her father brought her law books to study so she could participate in debates with his law clerks at the dinner table.  She wanted to go to college, but no colleges at that time accepted female students.  Moreover, her father initially decided she did not need further education.  He eventually agreed to enroll her in the [[Troy Female Seminary]] in [[Troy, New York]], which was founded and run by [[Emma Willard]].&lt;ref name=Griffith-8/&gt;

In her memoirs, Stanton said that during her student days in Troy she was greatly disturbed by a six-week religious revival conducted by [[Charles Grandison Finney]], an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] preacher and central figure in the [[Christian revival|revivalist]] movement. His preaching, combined with the [[Calvinistic]] [[Presbyterianism]] of her childhood, terrified her with the possibility of her own [[damnation]]: &quot;Fear of judgment seized my soul. Visions of the lost haunted my dreams. Mental anguish prostrated my health.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, ''Eighty Years &amp; More'', [https://archive.org/details/eightyyearsandm00stangoog/page/n59/mode/2up  p. 43]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Stanton credited her father and brother-in-law with convincing her to disregard Finney's warnings. She said they took her on a six-week trip to [[Niagara Falls]] during which she read works of rational philosophers who restored her reason and sense of balance.  Lori D. Ginzberg, one of Stanton's biographers, says there are problems with this story.  For one thing, Finney did not preach for six weeks in Troy while Stanton was there.  Ginzberg suspects that Stanton embellished a childhood memory to underline her belief that women harm themselves by falling under the spell of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
 [[File:ElizabethCadyStanton.jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her daughter, Harriot]] 

As a young woman, Stanton traveled often to the home of her cousin, [[Gerrit Smith]], who also lived in upstate New York.  His views were very different from those of her conservative father.  Smith was an abolitionist and a member of the &quot;[[Secret Six]]&quot;, a group of men who financed [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]] in an effort to spark an armed uprising of enslaved African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  At Smith's home, she met [[Henry Brewster Stanton]], a prominent abolitionist agent. Despite her father's reservations, the couple married in 1840, omitting the word &quot;obey&quot; from the marriage ceremony. Stanton later wrote, &quot;I obstinately refused to obey one with whom I supposed I was entering into an equal relation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, ''Eighty Years &amp; More'', [https://archive.org/details/eightyyearsandm00stangoog/page/n93/mode/2up p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt;  
While uncommon, this practice was not unheard of; Quakers had been omitting &quot;obey&quot; from the marriage ceremony for some time.&lt;ref&gt;McMIllen, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;
Stanton took her husband's surname as part of her own, signing herself Elizabeth Cady Stanton or E. Cady Stanton, but not Mrs. Henry B. Stanton. 

Soon after returning from their European honeymoon, the Stantons moved into the Cady household in Johnstown. Henry Stanton studied law under his father-in-law until 1843, when the Stantons moved to [[Boston]] (Chelsea), Massachusetts, where Henry joined a law firm. While living in Boston, Elizabeth enjoyed the social, political, and intellectual stimulation that came with a constant round of abolitionist gatherings. Here, she was influenced by such people as [[Frederick Douglass]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, ''Eighty Years &amp; More'', 
[https://archive.org/details/eightyyearsandm00stangoog/page/n149/mode/2up p. 127]&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1847, the Stantons moved to [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], New York, in the [[Finger Lakes]] region. [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton House (Seneca Falls, New York)|Their house]], which is now a part of the [[Women's Rights National Historical Park]], was purchased for them by Elizabeth's father.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p.110–111&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Elizabeth Cady Stanton House with plaque 2013.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton House (Seneca Falls, New York)|Stanton house in Seneca Falls]]]]

The couple had seven children.  At that time, child-bearing was considered to be a subject that should be handled with great delicacy.  Stanton took a different approach, raising a flag in front of her house after giving birth, a red flag for a boy and a white one for a girl.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; One of her daughters, [[Harriot Stanton Blatch]], became, like her mother, a leader of the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]]. Because of the spacing of their children's births, one historian has concluded that the Stantons must have used birth control methods.  Stanton herself said her children were conceived by what she called &quot;voluntary motherhood.&quot; In an era when it was commonly held that a wife must submit to her husband's sexual demands, Stanton believed that women should have command over their sexual relationships and [[childbirth|childbearing]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker, pp. 106–108&lt;/ref&gt;  She also said, however, that &quot;a healthy woman has as much passion as a man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Baker, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;!-- [[File:ElizabethCadyStanton-1848-Daniel-Henry.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1848 with two of her three sons]] --&gt;

Stanton encouraged both her sons and daughters to pursue a broad range of interests, activities, and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, pp. 109–113&lt;/ref&gt; She was remembered by her daughter Margaret as being &quot;cheerful, sunny and indulgent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;  She enjoyed motherhood and running a large household, but she found herself unsatisfied and even depressed by the lack of intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, ''Eighty Years &amp; More'', [https://archive.org/details/eightyyearsandm00stangoog/page/n169/mode/2up  pp. 146–148]&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the 1850s, Henry's work as a lawyer and politician kept him away from home for nearly 10 months out of every year. This frustrated Elizabeth when the children were small, because it made it difficult for her to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern continued in later years, with husband and wife living apart more often than together, maintaining separate households for several years.  Their marriage, which lasted 47 years, ended with Henry Stanton's death in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Henry and Elizabeth were staunch abolitionists, but Henry, like Elizabeth's father, disagreed with the idea of female suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; One biographer described Henry as, &quot;at best a halfhearted 'women's rights man'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Early activism==
=== World Anti-Slavery Convention ===
[[File:Mott Lucretia Painting Kyle 1841.jpg|thumb|[[Lucretia Mott]]]]
While on their honeymoon in England in 1840, the Stantons attended the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London.  Elizabeth was appalled by the convention's male delegates, who voted to prevent women from participating even if they had been appointed as delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. The men required the women to sit in a separate section, hidden by curtains from the convention's proceedings.  [[William Lloyd Garrison]], a prominent American abolitionist and supporter of women's rights who arrived after the vote had been taken, refused to sit with the men and sat with the women instead.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, pp. 72– 75&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lucretia Mott]], a [[Quaker]] minister, abolitionist and women's rights advocate, was one of the women who had been sent as a delegate.  Although Mott was much older than Stanton, they quickly bonded in an enduring friendship, with Stanton eagerly learning from the more experienced activist. While in London, Stanton heard Mott preach in a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] chapel, the first time Stanton had heard a woman give a sermon or even speak in public.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
Stanton later gave credit to this convention for focusing her interests on women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seneca Falls Convention===

An accumulation of experiences was having an effect on Stanton. The London convention had been a turning point in her life.  Her study of law books had convinced her that legal changes were necessary to overcome gender inequities.  She had personal experience of the stultifying role of women as wives and housekeepers. She said, &quot;the wearied, anxious look of the majority of women, impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular.&quot;&lt;ref name=80-years-148&gt;Stanton, ''Eighty Years and More'', [https://archive.org/details/eightyyearsandm00stangoog/page/n171/mode/2up p. 148]&lt;/ref&gt;  This knowledge, however, did not immediately lead to action.  Relatively isolated from other social reformers and fully occupied with household duties, she was at a loss as to how she could engage in social reform.
  
In the summer of 1848, Lucretia Mott traveled from Pennsylvania to attend a Quaker meeting near the Stanton's home.  Stanton was invited to visit with Mott and three other progressive Quaker women.  Finding herself in sympathetic company, Stanton said she poured out her &quot;long-accumulating discontent, with such vehemence and indignation that I stirred myself, as well as the rest of the party, to do and dare anything.&quot;&lt;ref name=80-years-148/&gt;  The gathered women agreed to organize a women's rights convention in Seneca Falls a few days later, while Mott was still in the area.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanton was the primary author of the convention's [[Declaration of Rights and Sentiments]],&lt;ref&gt; Dubois, The Elizabeth Cady Stanton – Susan B. Anthony Reader, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; which was modeled on the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]].  Its list of grievances included the wrongful denial of women's right to vote, signaling Stanton's intent to generate a discussion of women's suffrage at the convention. This was a highly controversial idea at the time but not an entirely new one.  Her cousin [[Gerrit Smith]], no stranger to radical ideas himself, had called for women's suffrage shortly before at the [[Liberty League]] convention in Buffalo.   When Henry Stanton saw the inclusion of woman suffrage in the document, he told his wife that she was acting in a way that would turn the proceedings into a farce. Lucretia Mott, the main speaker, was also disturbed by the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IV6rt59asF8C&amp;pg=PA193 pp. 193–195]&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 300 women and men attended the two-day [[Seneca Falls Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Women's Rights National Historical Park, National Park Service, [https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture  &quot;All Men and Women Are Created Equal&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In her first address to a large audience, Stanton explained the purpose of the gathering and the importance of women's rights.  Following a speech by Mott, Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments, which the attendees were invited to sign.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, pp. 90–01.  Griffith says on p. 41 that Stanton had earlier spoken to a smaller group of women on temperance and women's rights.&lt;/ref&gt; Next came the resolutions, all of which the convention adopted unanimously except for the ninth, which read, &quot;it is the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves the sacred right of the elective franchise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ginzberg, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a vigorous debate, this resolution was adopted only after [[Frederick Douglass]], an abolitionist leader who had formerly been enslaved, gave it his strong support.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Frederick Douglass (1840s).jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Douglass]]

Stanton's sister Harriet attended the convention and signed its Declaration of Sentiments.  Her husband, however, made her remove her signature.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this was a local convention organized on short notice, its controversial nature ensured that it was widely noted in the press, with articles appearing in newspapers in New York City, Philadelphia and many other places.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;  The Seneca Falls Convention is now recognized as an historic event, the first convention to be called for the purpose of  discussing women's rights. The convention's [[Declaration of Sentiments]] became &quot;the single most important factor in spreading news of the women's rights movement around the country in 1848 and into the future&quot;, according to Judith Wellman, a historian of the convention.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IV6rt59asF8C&amp;pg=PA192 p. 192]&lt;/ref&gt; The convention initiated the use of women's rights conventions as organizing tools for the early women's movement.  By the time of the second [[National Women's Rights Convention#1851 in Worcester| National Women's Rights Convention]] in 1851, the demand for women's right to vote had become a central tenet of the [[Feminism in the United States|United States women's rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Mari Jo and Paul Buhle, ''The Concise History of Woman Suffrage'', 1978, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ukXENIk2uSkC&amp;pg=PA90 p. 90]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|Rochester Women's Rights Convention]] was held in [[Rochester, New York]] two weeks later, organized by local women who had attended the one in Seneca Falls.  Both Stanton and Mott spoke at this convention. The convention in Seneca Falls had been chaired by [[James Mott]], the husband of Lucretia Mott.  The Rochester convention was chaired by a woman, [[Abigail Bush]], another historic first.  Many people were disturbed by the idea of a woman chairing a convention of both men and women. How, for example, might people react if a woman ruled a man out of order?  Stanton herself spoke in opposition to the election of a woman as the chair of this convention, although she later acknowledged her mistake and apologized for her action.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] was organized in 1850, Stanton was unable to attend because she was pregnant.  Instead, she sent a letter to the convention that outlined the movement's goals.  Thereafter it became a tradition to open national women's rights conventions with a letter by Stanton, who not did participate in person in a national convention until 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 65.  Stanton's sister Catherine Wilkeson signed the Call to the 1850 convention, according to Ginzberg, p. 220, footnote 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnership with Susan B. Anthony===
While visiting Seneca Falls in 1851, [[Susan B. Anthony]] was introduced to Stanton by [[Amelia Bloomer]], a mutual friend and a supporter of women's rights. Anthony, who was five years younger than Stanton, came from a Quaker family that was active in reform movements.  Anthony and Stanton soon became close friends and co-workers, forming a relationship that was a turning point in their lives and of great importance to the women's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The two women had complementary skills. Anthony excelled at organizing, while Stanton had an aptitude for intellectual matters and writing. Stanton later said, &quot;In writing we did better work together than either could alone. While she is slow and analytical in composition, I am rapid and synthetic.  I am the better writer, she the better critic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in McMillen, pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthony deferred to Stanton in many ways throughout their years of work together, not accepting an office in any organization that would place her above Stanton.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;  In their letters, they referred to one another as &quot;Susan&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Stanton&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Susan B Anthony c1855.png|left|thumb|Susan B. Anthony]]
Because Stanton was homebound with seven children while Anthony was unmarried and free to travel, Anthony assisted Stanton by supervising her children while Stanton wrote.  
Among other things, this allowed Stanton to write speeches for Anthony to give.&lt;ref name=Griffith-74&gt;Griffith, [https://archive.org/details/inherownright00elis/page/74 p. 74]&lt;/ref&gt;
One of Anthony's biographers said, &quot;Susan became one of the family and was almost another mother to Mrs. Stanton's children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;  One of Stanton's biographers said, &quot;Stanton provided the ideas, rhetoric, and strategy; Anthony delivered the speeches, circulated petitions, and rented the halls. Anthony prodded and Stanton produced.&quot;&lt;ref name=Griffith-74/&gt;  Stanton's husband said, &quot;Susan stirred the puddings, Elizabeth stirred up Susan, and then Susan stirs up the world!&quot;&lt;ref name=Griffith-74/&gt;  Stanton herself said, &quot;I forged the thunderbolts, she fired them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Eighty Years and More'',  [https://archive.org/details/eightyyearsandm00stangoog/page/n190 p. 165].&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1854, Anthony and Stanton &quot;had perfected a collaboration that made the New York State movement the most sophisticated in the country&quot;, according to [[Ann D. Gordon]], a professor of women's history.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Vol 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dBs4CO1DsF4C&amp;pg=PR30 p. xxx]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Stantons moved from Seneca Falls to New York City in 1861, a room was set aside for Anthony in every house they lived in. One of Stanton's biographers estimated that, over her lifetime, Stanton spent more time with Anthony than with any other adult, including her own husband.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, [https://archive.org/details/inherownright00elis/page/224 pp. 108, 224]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship was not without its strains, especially as Anthony could not match Stanton's charm and charisma.  In 1871, Anthony said, &quot;whoever goes into a parlor or before an audience with that woman does it at the cost of a fearful overshadowing, a price which I have paid for the last ten years, and that cheerfully, because I felt that our cause was most profited by her being seen and heard, and my best work was making the way clear for her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Vol 1,
 [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n465/mode/2up p. 396]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperance activity===
Excessive consumption of alcohol was a severe social problem during this period, one that began to diminish only in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;  Many activists considered [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] to be a women's rights issue because of laws that gave husbands complete control of the family and its finances. The law provided almost no recourse to a woman with a drunken husband, even if his condition left the family destitute and he was abusive to her and their children. If she managed to obtain a divorce, which was difficult to do, he could easily end up with sole guardianship of their children.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&amp;pg=PA58 p. 58]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, Anthony was elected as a delegate to the New York state temperance convention.  When she tried to participate in the discussion, the chairman stopped her, saying that women delegates were there only to listen and learn.  Years later, Anthony observed, &quot;No advanced step taken by women has been so bitterly contested as that of speaking in public. For nothing which they have attempted, not even to secure the suffrage, have they been so abused, condemned and antagonized.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Susan B. Anthony, &quot;Fifty Years of Work for Woman&quot; ''Independent'', 52 (February 15, 1900), pp. 414–17, as quoted in [[Lynn Sherr|Sherr, Lynn]], ''Failure Is Impossible: Susan B. Anthony in Her Own Words'', Random House, New York, 1995, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;
Anthony and other women walked out and announced their intention to organize a women's temperance convention.  Later that year, about five hundred women met in Rochester and created the Women's State Temperance Society, with Stanton as president and Anthony as state agent.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n113/mode/2up, pp. 64–68].&lt;/ref&gt;  This leadership arrangement, with Stanton in the public role as president and Anthony as the energetic force behind the scenes, was characteristic of the organizations they founded in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In her first public speech since 1848, Stanton delivered the convention's keynote address, one that antagonized religious conservatives.  She called for drunkenness to be legal grounds for divorce at a time when many conservatives opposed divorce for any reason.  She appealed for wives of drunkard husbands to take control of their marital relations, saying, &quot;Let no woman remain in relation of wife with the confirmed drunkard. Let no drunkard be the father of her children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n115/mode/2up, p. 67]&lt;/ref&gt;  She attacked the religious establishment, calling for women to donate their money to the poor instead of to the &quot;education of young men for the ministry, for the building up a theological aristocracy and gorgeous temples to the unknown God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n117/mode/2up, p. 68]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the organization's convention the following year, conservatives voted Stanton out as president, whereupon she and Anthony resigned from the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n143/mode/2up, pp. 92–95]&lt;/ref&gt; Temperance was not a significant reform activity for Stanton afterwards, although she continued to use local temperance societies in the early 1850s as conduits for advocating women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; She regularly wrote articles for ''[[The Lily (newspaper)|The Lily]]'', a monthly temperance newspaper that she helped transform into one that reported news of the women's rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, ''The Elizabeth Cady Stanton – Susan B. Anthony Reader'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote for [[The Una]], a women's rights periodical edited by [[Paulina Wright Davis]], and for the [[New York Tribune]], a daily newspaper edited by [[Horace Greeley]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Married Women's Property Act===

The status of married women at that time was defined by the doctrine of [[coverture]], by which wives were placed under the protection and control of their husbands.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg-17&gt;Ginzberg, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
In the words of [[William Blackstone]]'s authoritative ''Commentaries'', &quot;By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wellman, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;  The husband of a married woman became the owner of any property she brought into a marriage.  She could not sign contracts, operate a business in her own name, or retain custody of their children in the event of a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ginzberg-17/&gt;

In 1836, the New York legislature began considering a Married Women's Property Act, with women's rights advocate [[Ernestine Rose]] an early supporter who circulated petitions in its favor.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanton's father supported this reform. Having no sons to pass his considerable wealth to, he was faced with the prospect of having it eventually pass to the control of his daughters' husbands.  Stanton circulated petitions and lobbied legislators in favor of the proposed law as early as 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  

The law eventually passed in 1848.  It allowed a married woman to retain the property that she possessed before the marriage or acquired during the marriage, and it protected her property from her husband's creditors.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Enacted shortly before the Seneca Falls Convention, it indirectly strengthened the women's rights movement by increasing the ability of women to act independently.&lt;ref name=Griffith-100&gt;Griffith, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;  By weakening the traditional belief that husbands spoke for their wives, it assisted many of the reforms that Stanton championed, such as the right of women to speak in public and to vote.

In 1853, Susan B. Anthony organized a petition campaign in New York state for an improved property rights law for married women.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n155/mode/2up pp. 104, 122–28]&lt;/ref&gt;
As part of the presentation of these petitions to the legislature, Stanton spoke in 1854 to a joint session of the Judiciary Committee, arguing that voting rights were needed to enable women to protect their newly won property rights.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, Stanton spoke again to the Judiciary Committee, this time before a large audience in the assembly chamber, arguing that women's suffrage was the only real protection for married women, their children and their material assets.&lt;ref name=Griffith-100/&gt;   She pointed to similarities in the legal status of woman and slaves, saying, &quot;The prejudice against color, of which we hear so much, is no stronger than that against sex. It is produced by the same cause, and manifested very much in the same way. The negro's skin and the woman's sex are both prima facie evidence that they were intended to be in subjection to the white Saxon man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://awpc.cattcenter.iastate.edu/2017/03/21/a-slaves-appeal-1860/ ''Address to Judiciary Committee of the New York State Legislature''], from the web site of the Catt Center at Iowa State University&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature passed the improved law in 1860.

===Dress reform===

[[File:Bloomers.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Bloomers (clothing)|Bloomer]] dress]]
In 1851, [[Elizabeth Smith Miller]], Stanton's cousin, brought a new style of dress to the upstate New York area.  Unlike traditional floor-length dresses, it consisted of pantaloons worn under a knee-length dress.  [[Amelia Bloomer]], Stanton's friend and neighbor, publicized the attire in ''[[The Lily (newspaper)|The Lily]]'', a monthly magazine that she published.  Thereafter it was popularly known as the &quot;Bloomer&quot; dress, or just &quot;[[Bloomers]]&quot;. It was soon adopted by many female reform activists despite harsh ridicule from traditionalists, who considered the idea of women wearing any sort of trousers as a threat to the social order.  To Stanton, it solved the problem of climbing stairs with a baby in one hand, a candle in the other, and somehow also lifting the skirt of a long dress to avoid tripping.  Stanton wore &quot;Bloomers&quot; for two years, abandoning the attire only after it became clear that the controversy it created was distracting people from the campaign for women's rights.  Other women's rights activists eventually did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 64, 71, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce reform===
Stanton had already antagonized traditionalists in 1852 at the women's temperance convention by advocating a woman's right to divorce a drunken husband.  In an hour-long speech at the [[National Women's Rights Convention#1860 in New York |Tenth National Women's Rights Convention]] in 1860, she went further, generating a heated debate that took up an entire session.&lt;ref name=Griffith-101-104&gt;Griffith, pp. 101–104&lt;/ref&gt;  She cited tragic examples of unhealthy marriages, suggesting that some marriages amounted to &quot;legalized prostitution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, ''History of Woman Suffrage'' Vol 1, [https://archive.org/details/historyofwomansu01stanuoft/page/718/mode/2up p. 719]&lt;/ref&gt;  She challenged both the sentimental and the religious views of marriage, defining marriage as a civil contract subject to the same restrictions of any other contract.  If a marriage did not produce the expected happiness, she said, then it would be a duty to end it.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;
Strong opposition to her speech was voiced in the ensuing discussion.  Abolitionist leader [[Wendell Phillips]], arguing that divorce was not a women's rights issue because it affected both women and men equally, said the subject was out of order and tried unsuccessfully to have it removed from the record.&lt;ref name=Griffith-101-104/&gt;

In later years on the lecture circuit, Stanton's speech on divorce was one of her most popular, drawing audiences of up to 1200 people.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;
In an 1890 essay entitled &quot;Divorce versus Domestic Warfare&quot;, Stanton opposed calls by some women activists for stricter divorce laws, saying, &quot;The rapidly increasing number of divorces, far from showing a lower state of morals, proves exactly the reverse. Woman is in a transition period from slavery to freedom, and she will not accept the conditions and married life that she has heretofore meekly endured.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Quoted in DuBois, ''Woman Suffrage and Women's Rights'',  p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolitionist activity===

In 1860 Stanton published a pamphlet called ''The Slaves Appeal'' written from what she imagined to be the viewpoint of a female slave.&lt;ref name=venet-27&gt;Venet, p. 27.  Confusingly, the Catt Center at Iowa State University reprints under the title [https://awpc.cattcenter.iastate.edu/2017/03/21/a-slaves-appeal-1860/ ''A Slaves Appeal''] Stanton's speech to the New York Assembly in that same year, in which she compares the situation of women in some ways to slavery.&lt;/ref&gt;
The fictional speaker uses vivid religious language (&quot;Men and women of New York, the God of thunder speaks through you&quot;)&lt;ref name=slaves-appeal&gt;Elizabeth Cady Stanton, [https://archive.org/details/slavesappeal00stan/mode/2up ''The Slaves Appeal''], 1860, Weed, Parsons and Company, Printers; Albany, New York&lt;/ref&gt; that expresses religious views very different from those that Stanton herself held.  The speaker describes the horrors of slavery, saying, &quot;The trembling girl for whom thou didst pay a price but yesterday in a New Orleans market, is not thy lawful wife. Foul and damning, both to the master and the slave, is this wholesale violation of the immutable laws of God.&quot;&lt;ref name=slaves-appeal/&gt; The pamphlet called for defiance of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Federal Fugitive Slave Act]], and it included petitions to be used for opposing the practice of hunting escaped slaves.&lt;ref name=venet-27/&gt;

In 1861, Anthony organized a tour of abolitionist lecturers in upstate New York that included Stanton and several other speakers. The tour began in January just after [[South Carolina]] had seceded from the union but before other states had seceded and before the outbreak of war. In her speech, Stanton said that South Carolina was like a willful son whose behavior jeopardized the whole family and that the best course of action was to let it secede.  The lecture meetings were repeatedly disrupted by mobs operating under the belief that abolitionist activity was causing southern states to secede. Stanton was not able to participate some of the lectures because she had to return home to her children.&lt;ref&gt;Venet, pp. 26–29, 32&lt;/ref&gt;  At her husband's urging, she left the lecture tour because of the persistent threat of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's Loyal National League==

In 1863, Anthony moved into the Stantons' house in New York City and the two women began organizing the [[Women's Loyal National League]] to campaign for an amendment to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] that would abolish slavery.  Stanton became president of the new organization and Anthony was secretary.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg-108-110&gt;Ginzberg, pp. 108–110&lt;/ref&gt;
It was the first national women's political organization in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/not-for-ourselves-alone/biography|title=Biography|author=Judith E. Harper|work=Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony|publisher=Public Broadcasting System|access-date=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the largest petition drive in the nation's history up to that time, the League collected nearly 400,000 signatures to abolish slavery, representing approximately one out of every twenty-four adults in the Northern states.&lt;ref&gt;Venet, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PfE0ULar1JgC&amp;pg=PA148 p. 148]. The League was called by several variations of its name, including the Women's National Loyal League.&lt;/ref&gt;
The petition drive significantly assisted the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which ended slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
The League disbanded in 1864 after it became clear that the amendment would be approved.&lt;ref&gt;Harper (1899), [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n297/mode/2up p. 238]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although its purpose was the abolition of slavery, the League made it clear that it also stood for political equality for women, approving a resolution at its founding convention that called for equal rights for all citizens regardless of race or sex.&lt;ref&gt;Venet, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  The League indirectly advanced the cause of women's rights in several ways. Stanton pointedly reminded the public that petitioning was the only political tool available to women at a time when only men were allowed to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Venet, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PfE0ULar1JgC&amp;pg=PA116 pp. 105, 116]&lt;/ref&gt;
The success of the League's petition drive demonstrated the value of formal organization to the women's movement, which had traditionally resisted being anything other than loosely organized up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&amp;pg=PA105 p. 105]&lt;/ref&gt;
Its 5000 members constituted a widespread network of women activists who gained experience that helped create a pool of talent for future forms of social activism, including suffrage.&lt;ref&gt; Venet, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PfE0ULar1JgC&amp;pg=PA1 pp. 1, 122]&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanton and Anthony emerged from this endeavor with significant national reputations.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg-108-110/&gt;   

==American Equal Rights Association==

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Stanton and Anthony became alarmed at reports that the proposed [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution| Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which would provide citizenship for African Americans, would also for the first time introduce the word &quot;male&quot; into the constitution. Stanton said, &quot;if that word 'male' be inserted, it will take us a century at least to get it out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Stanton to Gerrit Smith, January 1, 1866, quoted in DuBois, ''Feminism &amp; Suffrage'', [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/61 p. 61]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Petition of E. Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucy Stone, and others (1865).jpg|thumb|left|A petition to Congress for a women's suffrage amendment signed by Stanton, Anthony, [[Lucy Stone]], [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]], [[Ernestine Rose]], and other leading women's rights activists]]

Organizing opposition to this development required preparation because the women's movement had become largely inactive during the Civil War.  In January 1866, Stanton and Anthony sent out petitions calling for a constitutional amendment providing for women's suffrage, with Stanton's name at the top of the list of signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, ''History of Woman Suffrage'', Vol II, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/90/mode/2up pp. 91, 97]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.archives.gov/id/306684 A Petition For Universal Suffrage], at the U.S. National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;
Stanton and Anthony organized the Eleventh [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in May, 1866, the first since the Civil War began.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, ''History of Woman Suffrage'', Vol II, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/152/mode/2up pp. 152–53]&lt;/ref&gt;
The convention voted to transform itself into the [[American Equal Rights Association]] (AERA), whose purpose was to campaign for the equal rights of all citizens regardless of race or sex, especially the right of suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, ''History of Woman Suffrage'', Vol II, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/170/mode/2up pp. 171–72]&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton was offered the post of president but declined in a favor of [[Lucretia Mott]].  Other officers included Stanton as first vice president, Anthony as a corresponding secretary, [[Frederick Douglass]] as a vice president, and [[Lucy Stone]] as a member of the executive committee.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, ''History of Woman Suffrage'', Vol II, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/174/mode/2up p. 174]&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanton provided hospitality for some of the attendees at this convention.  [[Sojourner Truth]], an abolitionist and women's rights activist who had formerly been enslaved, stayed at Stanton's house&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; as, of course, did Anthony.

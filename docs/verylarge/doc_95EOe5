Cecil appears as a character in the novels ''I, Elizabeth'' by [[Rosalind Miles]], ''The Virgin's Lover'' and ''The Other Queen'' by [[Philippa Gregory]], and is a prominent secondary character in several books by [[Bertrice Small]]. He is a prominent character in ''Legacy'', a novel of Elizabeth I by Susan Kay. He also appears prominently in the alternative history ''Ruled Britannia'', by [[Harry Turtledove]], in which he and his son Sir Robert Cecil are conspirators and patrons of William Shakespeare in an attempt to restore Elizabeth to power after a successful Spanish invasion and conquest of England. In addition, he is portrayed as a young man in [[Lamentation (novel)|''Lamentation'']] by [[C. J. Sansom]]. Burghley also appears in the espionage novels of [[Valerie Anand|Fiona Buckley]], featuring Elizabeth I's half-sister, Ursula Blanchard.

[[Guy Pearce]] portrays Cecil in the 2018 historical drama ''[[Mary Queen of Scots (2018 film)|Mary Queen of Scots]]'', directed by [[Josie Rourke]], which also stars [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Mary, Queen of Scots and [[Margot Robbie]] as Elizabeth I.

The 'Elizabethan class' [[Airspeed Ambassador]] G-ALZU of [[British European Airways|BEA]] that crashed in 1958 in the [[Munich air disaster]], was named ''Lord Burghley''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/6/newsid_2535000/2535961.stm|title=1958: United players killed in air disaster|date=6 February 1958|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/gallery/munich-air-disaster-5110362|title=Munich Air Disaster|first=Paul|last=McConnell|date=5 February 2015|website=mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clemens August of Bavaria''' ({{lang-de|Clemens August von Bayern}}) (17 August 1700 – 6 February 1761) was a member of the [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty of [[Bavaria]] and [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]].

==Biography==
Clemens August (Clementus Augustus) was born in [[Brussels]], the son of Elector [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian II Emanuel]] of Bavaria and [[Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska]] and the grandson of King [[John III Sobieski]] of [[Poland]]. His family was split during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and was for many years under house arrest in [[Austria]]; only in 1715 did the family become re-united.  

His uncle [[Joseph Clemens of Bavaria|Joseph Clemens]], [[Prince-elector|Elector]] and [[Archbishop of Cologne]], saw to it that Clemens August received several appointments in [[Altötting]], the [[Diocese of Regensburg]], and at the [[Berchtesgaden Provostry|Prince-Provostry of Berchtesgaden]], and he soon received [[papal]] confirmation as Bishop of Regensburg, and later of [[Archdiocese of Cologne|Cologne]].

As Archbishop of Cologne, he was one of the Electors, a [[Prince-Bishop of Münster]], [[Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim|Hildesheim]], and [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück|Osnabrück]], and a [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the [[Teutonic Order]].

Clemens August, who mostly sided with the [[Austria]]n [[Habsburg-Lorraine]] side during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], personally crowned his brother [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VII]] emperor at [[Frankfurt]] in 1742. After Charles's death in 1745, Clemens August then again leaned toward Austria. Over time, Clemens August changed more frequently the alliances, as of Allied of Austria or France, also under the influence of his frequently changing First Ministers and high donations.

He died in [[Festung Ehrenbreitstein]] in 1761. In March 1761, shortly after his death, [[Pope Clement XIII]] rejected the succession of Clemens August's brother Cardinal [[John Theodore of Bavaria]] as Archbishop and Prince-Elector of Cologne since the pope entertained some doubt on John Theodore's &quot;moral conduct&quot;. This was the end of the reign of the Wittelsbach in Cologne after 178 years of continuous rule. In his will, Clemens August donated only to his successor as Elector and the court chamber of the Electorate of Cologne, but not the Elector of Bavaria. His nephew [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian III. Joseph]] then tried to challenge the will before the [[Reichskammergericht|Supreme Court of Appeal]], however, this failed on 23 January 1767.

==Cultural legacy==
[[Image:Clemenswerth1.jpg|thumb|left|Clemenswerth Palace near [[Sögel]] built as a hunting lodge for Clemens August]]
Clemens August patronised the arts; among others he ordered to build the [[Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Brühl|palaces of Augustusburg and Falkenlust]] in [[Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia]], listed on the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO cultural world heritage list]], and the church of [[St Michael in Berg am Laim (München)|St Michael in Berg am Laim]] in [[Munich]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s Flemish grandfather became a musician in Bonn during the reign of Clemens August.

==Illegitimate children==
Clemens August and his mistress Mechthild Brion had a daughter:
* Anna Marie zu Löwenfeld (1735–1783) who married Franz Ludwig, Count of Holnstein (1723–1780), son of Clemens August's brother [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor]]

[[File:09541jfGuadalupe Cloverleaf Interchange J P Rizal Cembo Station Mandaluyong Makati Cityfvf 06.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This picture illustrates a variety of transportation systems: public transportation; private road use; and rail]]
'''Transport economics''' is a branch of economics founded in 1959 by American economist [[John R. Meyer]] that deals with the [[resource allocation|allocation of resources]] within the transport sector. It has strong links to civil engineering. Transport economics differs from some other branches of economics in that the assumption of a spaceless, instantaneous economy does not hold. People and goods flow over networks at certain speeds.  Demands peak.  Advance ticket purchase is often induced by lower fares.  The networks themselves may or may not be competitive. A single trip (the final good, in the consumer's eyes) may require the bundling of services provided by several firms, agencies and modes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civilengineerbuddy.com/transportation-economics-an-introduction-transportation-engineering/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although transport systems follow the same [[supply and demand]] theory as other industries, the complications of [[network effect]]s and choices between dissimilar goods (e.g. car and bus travel) make estimating the demand for transportation facilities difficult. The development of models to estimate the likely choices between the goods involved in transport decisions ([[discrete choice]] models) led to the development of an important branch of [[econometrics]], as well as a Nobel Prize for [[Daniel McFadden]].

In transport, [[Demand (economics)|demand]] can be measured in number of journeys made or in total distance traveled across all journeys (e.g. [[passenger-kilometer]]s for public transport or vehicle-kilometers of travel (VKT) for [[private transport]]). [[Supply (economics)|Supply]] is considered to be a measure of capacity. The price of the good (travel) is measured using the [[generalised cost]] of travel, which includes both money and time expenditure.

The effect of increases in supply (i.e. capacity) are of particular interest in transport economics (see [[induced demand]]), as the potential environmental consequences are significant (see ''externalities'' below).

== Externalities ==
In addition to providing benefits to their users, transport networks impose both [[positive externalities|positive]] and [[negative externalities]] on non-users. The consideration of these externalities – particularly the negative ones – is a part of transport economics.

Positive externalities of transport networks may include the ability to provide [[emergency services]], increases in land value, and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration benefits]]. Negative externalities are wide-ranging and may include local air pollution, [[noise pollution]], [[light pollution]], [[traffic safety|safety hazards]], [[:wikt:severance|community severance]] and [[traffic congestion|congestion]]. The contribution of transport systems to potentially hazardous [[climate change]] is a significant negative externality which is difficult to evaluate quantitatively, making it difficult (but not impossible) to include in transport economics-based research and analysis.

Congestion is considered a negative [[externality]] by economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Small | first = Kenneth A. | last2 = José A. Gomez-Ibañez | year = 1998 | title = Road Pricing for Congestion Management: The Transition from Theory to Policy| publisher = The University of California Transportation Center, University of California at Berkeley| pages = 213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An externality occurs when a transaction causes costs or benefits to third party, often, although not necessarily, from the use of a [[Public good (economics)|public good]]. For example, manufacturing or transportation cause air pollution imposing costs on others when making use of public air.

=== Traffic congestion ===
{{main|Traffic congestion}}
[[File:I-80 Eastshore Fwy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Typical traffic congestion in an urban freeway. Shown here is [[Interstate 80|I-80]] [[Eastshore Freeway]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California.]]

Traffic congestion is a negative externality caused by various factors. A 2005 American study stated that there are seven root causes of congestion, and gives the following summary of their contributions: bottlenecks 40%, traffic incidents 25%, bad weather 15%, work zones 10%, poor signal timing 5%, and special events/other 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traffic Congestion and Reliability: Trends and Advanced Strategies for Congestion Mitigation|date=1 September 2005|url=http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestion_report/congestion_report_05.pdf|publisher=U.S. Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the transport economics community, [[congestion pricing]] is considered to be an appropriate mechanism to deal with this problem (i.e. to internalise the externality) by allocating scarce roadway capacity to users. Capacity expansion is also a potential mechanism to deal with traffic congestion, but is often undesirable (particularly in urban areas) and sometimes has questionable benefits (see [[induced demand]]). [[William Vickrey]], winner of the 1996 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]] for his work on &quot;[[moral hazard]]&quot;, is considered one of the fathers of congestion pricing, as he first proposed it for the [[New York City Subway]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= Vickrey, William | year=1992|url=http://www.vtpi.org/vickrey.htm|title= Principles of Efficient Congestion Pricing|accessdate=2008-02-26|publisher = Victoria Transport Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the road transportation arena these theories were extended by [[Maurice Allais]], a fellow Nobel prize winner &quot;for his pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources&quot;, [[Gabriel Roth (economist)|Gabriel Roth]] who was instrumental in the first designs and upon whose [[World Bank]] recommendation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Walters | first = A. A. | year = 1968 | title = The Economics of Road User Charges| publisher = World Bank Staff Occasional Papers Number Five, Chapter VII, Washington, D.C. pp. 191–217| isbn = 978-0-8018-0653-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first system was put in place in Singapore. [[Reuben Smeed]], the deputy director of the [[Transport Research Laboratory|Transport and Road Research Laboratory]] was also a pioneer in this field, and his ideas were presented to the British government in what is known as the [[Smeed Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smeed |first=R.J. |year=1964 |title=Road pricing: the economic and technical possibilities |url=https://archive.org/details/op1265810-1001 |publisher=HMSO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congestion is not limited to road networks; the negative externality imposed by congestion is also important in busy public transport networks as well as crowded pedestrian areas, e.g. on the London Underground on a weekday or any urban train station, at peak times. There is the classical excess in demand compared to supply. This is because at peak times there is a large demand for trains, since people want to go home (i.e., a derived demand). However, space on the platforms and on the trains is limited and small compared to the demand for it. As a result, there are crowds of people outside the train doors and in the train station corridors. This increases delays for commuters, which can often cause a rise in stress or other problems.

Congestion pricing is an [[Pareto efficiency|efficiency pricing]] strategy that requires the users to pay more for that public good, thus increasing the welfare gain or net benefit for society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Button | first = Kenneth J. | year = 1993 | title = op. cit| pages = 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Small, Kenneth A. |author2=Verhoef, Erik T. | title = op. cit| year = 2007| pages = 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congestion pricing is one of a number of alternative [[Supply and demand|demand side]] (as opposed to [[supply side]]) strategies offered by economists to address congestion.&lt;ref name=&quot;prm_winter_1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Congestion Control and Demand Management |author1=Sheldon G.

From 2008 to 2011, [[Milan]] had a traffic charge scheme, [[Ecopass]], that exempted higher emission standard vehicles ([[Euro IV]]) and other [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/automobiles/27GREEN.html  | title=Toll Discounts for Going Green  | author = Ken Belson | date=27 January 2008 | newspaper =The New York Times  | accessdate=2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7167992.stm  | title=Milan introduces traffic charge  | date=2 March 2008 | work = BBC News | accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.nysun.com/article/68854  | title= Milan Introduces Congestion Charge To Cut Pollution | author = Marco Bertacche | date=3 January 2008 | newspaper = The New York Sun | accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later replaced by a more conventional [[congestion pricing]] scheme, [[Milan Area C|Area C]]. 

Even the transport economists who advocate congestion pricing have anticipated several practical limitations, concerns and controversial issues regarding the actual implementation of this policy. As summarized by noted regional planner [[Robert Cervero]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cervero | first = Robert | authorlink=Robert Cervero|year = 1998 | title = The Transit Metropolis | publisher = Island Press, Washington, D.C. | isbn = 1-55963-591-6  &lt;!--&quot;Setting the prices right&quot;--&gt;| pages = 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;True social-cost pricing of metropolitan travel has proven to be a theoretical ideal that so far has eluded real-world implementation. The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists, few people are in favor of considerably higher charges for peak-period travel. Middle-class motorists often complain they already pay too much in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars, and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury. In the United States, few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing in fear of reprisal from their constituents... Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy, pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered. It is for all these reasons that peak-periord pricing remains a pipe dream in the minds of many.&quot;

==== Road space rationing ====
{{main|Road space rationing}}
[[File:Traffic jam Sao Paulo 09 2006 30.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Traffic congestion persists in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], despite no-drive days based on license numbers.]]

Transport economists consider [[road space rationing]] an alternative to congestion pricing, but road space rationing is considered more equitable, as the restrictions force all drivers to reduce auto travel, while congestion pricing restrains less those who can afford paying the congestion charge. Nevertheless, high-income users can avoid the restrictions by owning a second car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Victoria Transport Policy Institute| url=http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm33.htm |title=Vehicle Restrictions. Limiting Automobile Travel at Certain Times and Places |publisher= TDM Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-04-09|language= }} See Equity Impacts section&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, congestion pricing (unlike rationing) acts &quot;to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evinced by users' willingness to pay for the resource&quot;. While some &quot;opponents of congestion pricing fear that tolled roads will be used only by people with high income. But preliminary evidence suggests that the new toll lanes in California are used by people of all income groups. The ability to get somewhere fast and reliably is valued in a variety of circumstances. Not everyone will need or want to incur a toll on a daily basis, but on occasions when getting somewhere quickly is necessary, the option of paying to save time is valuable to people at all income levels.&quot; Road space rationing based on license numbers has been implemented in cities such as [[Athens]] (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leda.ils.nrw.de/database/measures/meas0205.htm|title=LEDA Measure: License plate based traffic restrictions, Athens, Greece|publisher=LEDA database|accessdate=2008-04-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227030125/http://www.leda.ils.nrw.de/database/measures/meas0205.htm|archivedate=27 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[México City]] (1989), [[São Paulo]] (1997), [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]], [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], La Paz (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boliviahoy.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3150 | title=Los choferes públicos acataron la restricción | date=7 January 2003 | newspaper=La Prensa | accessdate=2008-04-09 | language=Spanish | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213053528/http://www.boliviahoy.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3150 | archive-date=13 December 2006 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolivia]], and [[San José de Costa Rica|San José]] (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2005/agosto/03/pais0.html | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515152117/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2005/agosto/03/pais0.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=15 May 2016 | title=Hoy empieza restricción para autos en centro de San José | author=Ángela Ávalos | date=3 August 2005 | newspaper=La Nación | accessdate=2008-04-08 | language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/abril/12/pais2.html | title=Evaluarán restricción vehicular en capital | author=Mercedes Agüero | date=12 April 2006 | newspaper=La Nación | accessdate=2008-04-08 | language=Spanish | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919101624/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/abril/12/pais2.html | archivedate=19 September 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Costa Rica]].

==== Tradable mobility credits ====
A more acceptable policy on automobile travel restrictions, proposed by transport economists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Verhoef E, [[Peter Nijkamp|Nijkamp P]], Rietveld P | url = http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=b240527 | year = 1997 | title = Tradeable permits: their potential in the regulation of road transport externalities | publisher = Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 24(4) 527–548 |accessdate=2008-04-11  |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid inequality and revenue allocation issues, is to implement a [[rationing]] of peak period travel but through revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This concept is similar to the existing system of [[emissions trading]] of [[carbon credit]]s, proposed by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to curb [[greenhouse emissions]]. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, will have the option to use the local government-issued mobility rights or congestion credits for themselves, or to trade or sell them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond the personal quota. This trading system will allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0967-070X(01)00024-5     |title=Making urban road pricing acceptable and effective: Searching for quality and equity in urban mobility |year=2001 |last1=Viegas |first1=José M. |journal=Transport Policy |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=289–294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.tra.2005.02.014     |title=Credit-based congestion pricing: A policy proposal and the public's response |year=2005 |last1=Kockelman |first1=Kara M. |last2=Kalmanje |first2=Sukumar |journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice |volume=39 |issue=7–9 |pages=671–690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding and financing ==
[[File:Corridor Capacity and Infrastructure Costs.png|thumb|Corridor Capacity and Infrastructure Costs]]
Methods of funding and financing transport network maintenance, improvement and expansion are debated extensively and form part of the transport economics field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business models for transport infrastructure assets?

Funding issues relate to the ways in which money is raised for the supply of transport capacity. Taxation and [[user fees]] are the main methods of fund-raising. Taxation may be general (e.g. [[income tax]]), local (e.g. [[sales tax]] or [[land value tax]]) or variable (e.g. [[fuel tax]]), and user fees may be tolls, congestion charges or fares). The method of funding often attracts strong political and public debate.

Financing issues relate to the way in which these funds are used to pay for the supply of transport. Loans, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], [[public–private partnership]]s and concessions are all methods of financing transport investment.

== Regulation and competition ==
Regulation of the supply of transport capacity relates to both safety regulation and [[regulatory economics|economic regulation]]. Transport economics considers issues of the economic regulation of the supply of transport, particularly in relation to whether transport services and networks are provided by the public sector, by the private sector, or a mixture of both.

Transport networks and services can take on any combination of regulated/deregulated and public/private provision. For example, bus services in the UK outside London are provided by both the public and private sectors in a deregulated economic environment (where no-one specifies which services are to be provided, so the provision of services is influenced by the [[Market (economics)|market]]), whereas bus services within London are provided by the private sector in a regulated economic environment (where the public sector specifies the services to be provided and the private sector competes for the right to supply those services – i.e. [[franchising]]).

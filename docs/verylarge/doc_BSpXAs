==Taxonomy==
The Thunnini tribe is a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]] comprising 15 species in five [[genera]]:
:* family [[Scombridae]]
:** '''tribe Thunnini: tunas'''
:*** genus ''[[Allothunnus]]:'' slender tunas
:*** genus ''[[Auxis]]:'' frigate tunas
:*** genus ''[[Euthynnus]]:'' little tunas
:*** genus ''[[Katsuwonus]]:'' skipjack tunas
:*** genus ''[[Thunnus]]:'' albacores and true tunas
:**** [[subgenus]] ''Thunnus ([[Thunnus (subgenus)|Thunnus]])'': bluefin group
:**** subgenus ''Thunnus ([[Neothunnus (subgenus)|Neothunnus]])'': yellowfin group

The [[cladogram]] is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between [[taxa]], and is read left-to-right as if on a timeline. The following cladogram illustrates the relationship between the tunas and other tribes of the family Scombridae.  For example, the cladogram illustrates that the [[skipjack tuna]]s are more closely related to the [[true tuna]]s than are the [[slender tuna]]s (the most primitive of the tunas), and that the next nearest relatives of the tunas are the [[bonito]]s of the tribe Sardini.&lt;ref name=Graham2004/&gt;

===True tuna species===
[[File:Tuna Relative Sizes.jpg|thumb|Relative sizes of various tunas, with the [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] (top) at about {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} in this sample]]
The &quot;true&quot; tunas are those that belong to the genus ''Thunnus''.  Until recently, it was thought that there were seven ''Thunnus'' species, and that [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] and [[Pacific bluefin tuna]] were [[subspecies]] of a single species. In 1999, Collette established that based on both molecular and morphological considerations, they are in fact distinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Collette |first=B.B. |conference=5th Indo-Pacific Fish Conference: Nouméa, New Caledonia, 3–8 November 1997 |editor=Séret, B. |editor2=Sire, J.Y. |title=Mackerels, molecules, and morphology|year=1999|publisher=Société Française d'Ichtyologie [u.a.] |book-title=Proceedings |location=Paris|isbn=978-2-9507330-5-4 |pages=149–164 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0cWAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanaka2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tanaka |first1=Y. |first2=K. |last2=Satoh |first3=M. |last3=Iwahashi |first4=H. |last4=Yamada |title=Growth-dependent recruitment of Pacific bluefin tuna ''Thunnus orientalis'' in the northwestern Pacific Ocean |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |year=2006 |volume=319 |pages=225–235 |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=18108521 |doi=10.3354/meps319225|bibcode=2006MEPS..319..225T |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genus ''Thunnus'' is further classified into two [[subgenera]]: ''Thunnus ([[Thunnus (subgenus)|Thunnus]])'' (the bluefin group), and ''Thunnus ([[Neothunnus (subgenus)|Neothunnus]])'' (the yellowfin group).

[[File:Thunnus obesus (Bigeye tuna) diagram cropped.GIF|thumb|[[Bigeye tuna]] ''Thunnus obesus'' showing finlets and keels. Finlets are found between the last dorsal and/or anal fin and the caudal fin. They are rayless and non-retractable.&lt;br/&gt;Drawing by Dr Tony Ayling]]

===Description===
The tuna is a sleek and streamlined fish, adapted for speed.  It has two closely spaced [[dorsal fins]] on its back; The first is &quot;depressible&quot;&amp;nbsp;– it can be laid down, flush, in a groove that runs along its back. Seven to 10 yellow [[Pterygiophore|finlet]]s run from the dorsal fins to the tail, which is lunate&amp;nbsp;– curved like a crescent moon&amp;nbsp;– and tapered to pointy tips. The [[caudal peduncle]], to which the tail is attached, is quite thin, with three stabilizing horizontal [[Homocercal|keel]]s on each side. The tuna's dorsal side is generally a metallic dark blue, while the ventral side, or underside, is silvery or whitish, for [[camouflage]].&lt;ref name=RISeaGrant&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibbs |first=E. |title=Fact Sheet: Tuna #P1412 |url=http://seagrant.gso.uri.edu/factsheets/tuna.html |publisher=Rhode Island Sea Grant |access-date=20 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712070954/http://seagrant.gso.uri.edu/factsheets/tuna.html |archive-date=July 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiology===
''Thunnus'' are widely but sparsely distributed throughout the oceans of the world, generally in tropical and temperate waters at [[latitude]]s ranging between about [[45th parallel north|45° north]] and [[45th parallel south|south]] of the equator.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISSF&quot;/&gt; All tunas are able to maintain the temperature of certain parts of their body above the temperature of ambient seawater. For example, bluefin can maintain a core body temperature of {{Convert|25|-|33|C|F}}, in water as cold as {{Convert|6|C|F}}.

Tunas achieve [[endothermy]] by conserving the heat generated through normal [[metabolism]]. In all tunas, the heart operates at [[ambient temperature]], as it receives cooled blood, and coronary circulation is directly from the [[gills]].&lt;ref name=SERCA2/&gt; The ''[[rete mirabile]]'' (&quot;wonderful net&quot;), the intertwining of veins and arteries in the body's periphery, allows nearly all of the metabolic heat from [[venous blood]]&lt;!-- NOT arterial --&gt; to be &quot;re-claimed&quot; and transferred to the [[arterial blood]]&lt;!-- NOT venous --&gt; via a [[counter-current exchange]] system, thus mitigating the effects of surface cooling.&lt;ref name=Cech1984&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cech |first1=J.J. |last2=Laurs |first2=R.M. |last3=Graham |first3=J.B. |year=1984 |title=Temperature-induced changes in blood gas equilibria in the albacore, ''Thunnus alalunga'', a warm-bodied tuna |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=21–34 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/109/1/21.full.pdf|quote=Oxygenated blood that has just reached thermal equilibrium with ambient sea water in the gills enters the rete on the arterial side, while warmed, deoxygenated, and carbon dioxide-laden blood enters on the venous end. In the rete, countercurrent flow and the high surface area contact between the two blood supplies facilitate the transfer of nearly all of the metabolic heat in the venous blood to arterial blood, thus conserving muscle temperature. After exiting the rete, arterial blood continues to the red muscle capillary beds, and cooled venous blood flows to the gills where carbon dioxide is excreted and oxygen is loaded. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the tuna to elevate the temperatures of the highly-[[aerobic respiration|aerobic]] tissues of the skeletal muscles, eyes and brain,&lt;ref name=muscletemp/&gt;&lt;ref name=SERCA2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landeira-Fernandez |first1=A.M. |last2=Morrissette |first2=J.M. |last3=Blank |first3=J.M. |last4=Block |first4=B.A. |title=Temperature dependence of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (SERCA2) in the ventricles of tuna and mackerel|journal=American Journal of Physiology.

Also unlike most fish, which have white flesh, the muscle tissue of tuna ranges from pink to dark red. The red [[Myotome|myotomal]] muscles derive their color from [[myoglobin]], an oxygen-binding molecule, which tuna express in quantities far higher than most other fish.  The oxygen-rich blood further enables energy delivery to their muscles.&lt;ref name=muscletemp/&gt;

For powerful swimming animals like [[dolphin]]s and tuna, [[cavitation]] may be detrimental, because it limits their maximum swimming speed.&lt;ref name=speedlimit&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iosilevskii|first1=G|last2=Weihs|first2=D|title=Speed limits on swimming of fishes and cetaceans|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|date=6 March 2008|volume=5|issue=20|pages=329–338|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1073|pmid=17580289|quote=Lacking pain receptors on their caudal fins, scombrids may temporarily cross the cavitation limit, and cavitation-induced damage has been observed (Kishinouye 1923); on the other hand, delphinids probably cannot cross it without pain (Lang 1966)|pmc=2607394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if they have the power to swim faster, dolphins may have to restrict their speed, because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are too painful. Cavitation also slows tuna, but for a different reason. Unlike dolphins, these fish do not feel the bubbles, because they have bony fins without nerve endings. Nevertheless, they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins that limits their speed. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.&lt;ref name=speedlimit/&gt;

===Commercial fishing===
Tuna is an important [[commercial fishing|commercial fish]]. The [[International Seafood Sustainability Foundation]] (ISSF) compiled a detailed scientific report on the state of global tuna stocks in 2009, which includes regular updates.  According to the ISSF, the most important species for commercial and recreational tuna fisheries are yellowfin (''Thunnus albacares''), bigeye (''T. obesus''), bluefin (''T. thynnus'', ''T. orientalis'', and ''T. macoyii''), albacore (''T. alalunga''), and skipjack (''Katsuwonus pelamis'').&lt;ref name=&quot;ISSF&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Based on catches from 2007, the report states:

{{quote|Between 1940 and the mid-1960s, the annual world catch of the five principal market species of tunas rose from about 300 thousand tons to about 1 million tons, most of it taken by hook and line. With the development of [[Seine fishing|purse-seine]] nets, now the predominant gear, catches have risen to more than 4 million tons annually during the last few years. Of these catches, about 68 percent are from the Pacific Ocean, 22 percent from the Indian Ocean, and the remaining 10 percent from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Skipjack makes up about 60 percent of the catch, followed by yellowfin (24 percent), bigeye (10 percent), albacore (5 percent), and bluefin the remainder. Purse-seines take about 62 percent of the world production, longline about 14 percent, pole and line about 11 percent, and a variety of other gears the remainder.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISSF&quot;/&gt;}}
The Australian government alleged in 2006 that [[Japan]] had illegally [[overfished]] southern bluefin by taking 12,000 to 20,000 tonnes per year instead of the agreed upon 6,000 tonnes; the value of such overfishing would be as much as US$2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-10-16/bluefin-tuna-plundering-catches-up-with-japan/1286956 |last=Bradford |first=Gillian |title=Bluefin Tuna Plundering Catches Up With Japan |publisher=ABC News |date=October 16, 2006 |access-date=11 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such overfishing has severely damaged bluefin stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/28/AR2009112801066.html |last=Eilperin |first=Juliet |title=Global approach now favored for marine conservation |newspaper=Washington Post |date=November 29, 2009 |access-date=11 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], &quot;Japan's huge appetite for tuna will take the most sought-after stocks to the brink of commercial [[extinction]] unless fisheries agree on more rigid quotas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In November 2011, a different record was set when a fisherman in [[Massachusetts]] caught an {{convert|881|lb|kg|abbr=on}} tuna. It was captured inadvertently using a dragnet. Due to the laws and restrictions on tuna fishing in the United States, federal authorities impounded the fish because it was not caught with a rod and reel. Because of the tuna's deteriorated condition as a result of the trawl net, the fish sold for just under $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/man-catches-881-pound-tuna-seized-feds-194650751.html |title=Man catches 881-pound tuna, seized by feds &amp;#124; The Sideshow&amp;nbsp;– Yahoo!

Besides for edible purposes, many tuna species are caught frequently as game, often for recreation or for contests in which money is awarded based on weight. Larger specimens are notorious for putting up a fight while hooked, and have been known to injure people who try to catch them, as well as damage their equipment.

===Association with whaling===
In 2005, [[Nauru]], defending its vote from Australian criticism at that year's meeting of the [[International Whaling Commission]], argued that some [[whale]] species have the potential to devastate Nauru's tuna stocks, and that Nauru's food security and economy relies heavily on fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dorney |first=Sean |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-06-28/nauru-defends-whaling-vote/2046680 |title=Nauru defends whaling vote. 28/06/2005. ABC News Online |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2005-06-28 |access-date=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Nauru does not permit [[whaling]] in its own waters and does not allow other fishing vessels to take or intentionally interact with marine mammals in its Exclusive Economic Zone. In 2010 and 2011, Nauru supported Australian proposals&lt;ref name=Aus_PS_mammal&gt;{{cite web|last=Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission |title=Australia Proposals to Address the Impact of Purse Seine Fishing Activity on Cetaceans |url=http://wcpfc.int/system/files/documents/meetings/regular-sessions-commission/eighth-regular-session/delegation-proposals-and-paper/WCPFC8-2011-DP-15B-%28Rev-2%29-Australia-Proposals-Address-Impact-Purse-Seine-Fishing-Activity-Cetaceans.pdf |publisher=WCPFC |access-date=11 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101065208/http://wcpfc.int/system/files/documents/meetings/regular-sessions-commission/eighth-regular-session/delegation-proposals-and-paper/WCPFC8-2011-DP-15B-%28Rev-2%29-Australia-Proposals-Address-Impact-Purse-Seine-Fishing-Activity-Cetaceans.pdf |archive-date=November 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a western Pacific-wide ban on tuna purse-seining in the vicinity of marine mammals&amp;nbsp;– a measure which was agreed by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission at its eighth meeting in March 2012.

===Association with dolphins===
[[Dolphin]]s swim beside several tuna species. These include yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean, but not [[albacore]]. Tuna schools are believed to associate themselves with dolphins for protection against sharks, which are tuna [[predator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/border/ensenada.html |title=ENSENADA: El Puerto del Atun |publisher=Journalism.berkeley.edu |access-date=2010-09-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524134557/http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/border/ensenada.html |archive-date=2010-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial fishing vessels used to exploit this association by searching for dolphin pods. Vessels would encircle the pod with nets to catch the tuna beneath,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolphin-safe tuna|publisher=Whale and Dolphin Conservation|url=http://www.wdcs-na.org/text/story_details.php?select=308|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927135421/http://www.wdcs-na.org/text/story_details.php?select=308|archive-date=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the nets were prone to entangling dolphins, injuring or killing them. Public outcry and new government regulations, which are now monitored by [[NOAA]] have led to more &quot;dolphin friendly&quot; methods, now generally involving lines rather than nets. However, there are neither universal independent inspection programs nor verification of &quot;dolphin safeness&quot;, so these protections are not absolute. According to [[Consumers Union]], the resulting lack of accountability means claims of tuna that is &quot;[[Dolphin safe label|dolphin safe]]&quot; should be given little credence.

Fishery practices have changed to be dolphin friendly, which has caused greater [[bycatch]] including [[shark]]s, [[turtle]]s and other [[oceanic fish]]. Fishermen no longer follow dolphins, but concentrate their fisheries around floating objects such as [[fish aggregation device]]s, also known as FADs, which attract large populations of other organisms. Measures taken thus far to satisfy the public demand to protect dolphins can be potentially damaging to other species as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Southern Fried Science| title=The ecological disaster that is dolphin safe tuna |url=http://southernfriedscientist.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/the-ecological-disaster-that-is-dolphin-safe-tuna/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquaculture===
Increasing quantities of high-grade tuna caught at sea are reared in net pens and fed bait fish. In Australia, former fishermen raise [[southern bluefin tuna]] (''Thunnus maccoyii'') and another bluefin species.&lt;ref name=doolette&gt;{{cite journal

==As food==
===Fresh and frozen===
The fresh or frozen flesh of tuna is widely regarded as a delicacy in most areas where it is shipped, being prepared in a variety of ways for the sake of achieving specific flavors or textures. One way that fresh tuna is served is in [[sushi]]. When served as a [[steak]], the meat of [[Tuna#Taxonomy|most species]] is known for its thickness and tough texture. In the U.K., supermarkets began flying in fresh tuna steaks in the late 1990s, which helped to increase the popularity of using fresh tuna in cooking; by 2009, celebrity chefs regularly featured fresh tuna in salads, wraps, and char-grilled dishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/how-tuna-conquered-the-world-1700127.html |title=How Tuna Conquered the World |last=Hickman |first=Martin |date=9 June 2009 |website=www.independent.co.uk |publisher=The Independent |access-date=30 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh bluefin tuna is considered a &quot;cultural institution in Japan and there is still an enormous demand for this delicacy&quot; at restaurants.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;
&lt;gallery class=&quot;center&quot; heights=&quot;85px&quot;&gt; However, tuna consumption increases the risk of getting cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/project/Tuna-causes-cancer|title=Tuna causes cancer|website=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canned===
{{See also|Canned fish#Tuna}}
[[File:Canned and packaged tuna on supermarket shelves.jpg|thumb|right|Canned tuna on sale at a supermarket|alt=Small cans on grocery shelves|275x275px]]

[[Canned fish|Canned]] tuna was first produced in Australia in 1903, and quickly became popular.&lt;ref name=Choice2004&gt;[[Choice magazine|Choice]]: Jan/Feb 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuna is canned in edible [[Vegetable oil|oil]]s, in [[brine]], in water, and in various sauces. Tuna may be processed and labeled as &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;chunked&quot; (&quot;chunk&quot;) or &quot;flaked&quot;. When tuna is canned and packaged for sale, the product is sometimes called '''tuna fish''' (U.S.), a [[calque]] (loan translation) from the [[German language|German]] ''[[wikt:Thunfisch|Thunfisch]]''.

In the United States, 52% of canned tuna is used for [[Tuna sandwich|sandwich]]es; 22% for [[tuna salad]]s; and 15% for [[tuna casserole]]s and dried, prepackaged [[meal kit]]s, such as [[General Mills]]'s [[Hamburger Helper|Tuna Helper]] line.&lt;ref name=&quot;modernmarvels&quot;&gt;&quot;Tuna&quot;. ''Modern Marvels'', 4 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Other canned tuna dishes include [[tuna melt]]s (a type of sandwich where the tuna is mixed with mayonnaise and served on bread with cheese melted on top); [[salade niçoise]] (a salad made of tuna, olives, green beans, potatoes, hard-boiled eggs and anchovy dressing); and tuna burgers (served on buns).

In some markets, depending upon the color of the flesh of the tuna species, the can is marked as &quot;light&quot; or &quot;white&quot; meat, with &quot;light&quot; meaning a greyish pink color and &quot;white&quot; meaning a light pink color. In the United States, only [[albacore]] can legally be sold in canned form as &quot;white meat tuna&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Richard.  ''Tuna: A Love Story.'' New York: Random House, 2009, p. 119. {{ISBN|0-307-38710-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other countries, [[Yellowfin tuna|yellowfin]] is also acceptable. While in the early 1980s canned tuna in Australia was most likely [[Southern bluefin tuna|southern bluefin]], {{As of|2003|lc=on}} it was usually yellowfin, [[Skipjack tuna|skipjack]], or [[tongol]] (labelled &quot;northern bluefin&quot; or &quot;longtail&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Choice2004&quot; /&gt;

As tunas are often caught far from where they are processed, poor interim conservation can lead to spoilage. Tuna is typically [[gutted]] by hand, and later precooked for prescribed times of 45 minutes to three hours. The fish are then cleaned and [[Fish fillet|fillet]]ed, canned (and sealed), with the dark lateral blood meat often separately canned for [[pet food]] ([[Cat food|cat]] or [[Dog food|dog]]).  The sealed can is then heated under pressure (called &quot;[[Pressure cooking|retort cooking]]&quot;) for 2–4 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The international standard sets the maximum histamine level at 200 milligrams per kilogram. An Australian study of 53 varieties of unflavored canned tuna found none to exceed the safe histamine level, although some had &quot;off&quot; flavors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choice2004&quot; /&gt;

Australian standards once required cans of tuna to contain at least 51% tuna, but those regulations were dropped in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choice2003&quot;&gt;[[Choice magazine|Choice]], August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=104101&amp;catId=100406&amp;tid=100008&amp;p=2&amp;title=Test:+Canned+tuna+(archived) Test: Canned tuna (archived) Canned or conned?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801143345/http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=104101&amp;catId=100406&amp;tid=100008&amp;p=2&amp;title=Test%3A+Canned+tuna+%28archived%29 |date=August 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining weight is usually oil or water.

===Mercury and health===

A 2010 tuna fishery assessment report, released in January 2012 by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, supported this finding, recommending that all tuna fishing should be reduced or limited to current levels and that limits on skipjack fishing be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

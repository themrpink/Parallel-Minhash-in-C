The books are printed in small format. Bruna considers it important that his audience feels that his books are there for them, not for their parents. Most Miffy books have an advisory reading level of age 4 to 8 years.

Bruna's books have now been translated into more than 50 different languages, and over 85 million copies have been sold all over the world.&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt; It’s also translated in dialects, including in [[Zeelandic]] by [[Engel Reinhoudt]].&lt;ref name=auto&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://myprivacy.dpgmedia.net/?siteKey=T95VvHnpH6PXut6j&amp;callbackUrl=https%3a%2f%2fwww.pzc.nl%2fprivacy-gate%2faccept%3fredirectUri%3d%252fbevelanden%252fzanger-en-dialectschrijver-engel-reinhoudt-overleden%257ea1611928%252f%253freferrer%253dhttps%253a%252f%252fen.wikipedia.org%252f|title= Zanger en dialectschrijver Engel Reinhoudt overleden |website=PZC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Bruna has won many awards for his books, such as the Golden Brush in 1990, for ''Boris Bear'' and the Silver Brush for ''Miffy In The Tent'' in 1996. In 1997, he was awarded the Silver Slate for ''Dear Grandma Bunny'', a book where Miffy's Grandmother was sick and died.

The other characters that appear in the books are her family: Miffy's parents, her Grandma and Grandpa, her Auntie Alice, and 'Uncle Brian,' a family friend, who appears in ''Miffy Goes Flying''. A new brother or sister for Miffy is introduced in ''Miffy And The New Baby''. She also has many friends, Boris and Barbara Bear, who first appeared in 1989 and are boyfriend and girlfriend, Poppy Pig, who appeared in 1977, and her niece Grunty, Snuffy, who appeared in 1969, and other bunnies such as Aggie and Melanie.

Miffy was designed as a children's book character, but the design is now used on many other things like clothes, stationery, toys, glasses, household items etc.

In the early 1990s, an image of Miffy holding an [[adjustable spanner]] coyly behind her back appeared on flyers produced by people taking [[direct action]] against the [[UK]] government's road building program. This unauthorised use of the character spread&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthfirst.org.uk/actionreports/node/2879 |title=Miffed by Miffy, Earth First! Action Reports |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Af7lwZpl?url=http://www.earthfirst.org.uk/actionreports/node/2879 |archive-date=2012-09-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Miffy became a [[mascot]] for groups involved in radical ecological direct action.

Miffy appeared in her first TV show in 1992, called ''Dick Bruna's Miffy Storybook Classics: The Original Series''. Each episode was traditionally animated and ran for approximately five minutes. The show aired in the Netherlands on [[Katholieke Radio Omroep|KRO]], in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], in [[Canada]] on [[TVOntario]] in [[Australia]] on [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]], and in the [[United States]] on Cartoon Network's Small World block with VHS releases from Geneon USA, episodes of the show were later included as Bonus Features on [[Miffy and Friends]] DVDs.

From 2002 to 2008, ''[[Miffy and Friends]]'' aired on children's television channels such as [[Treehouse TV|Treehouse]] in Canada, and [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] in the U.S. It then moved to public television. The show added several new characters, such as Melanie's African family and the family of Boris' and Barbara's common cousin, Umik. The series was produced by Pedri Animation BV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pedri-animation.com |title=Pedri Animation homepage |author= |work= |publisher=Pedri-animation.com |accessdate=|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Dutch stop-motion animation company. It was voiced simply by a feminine storytelling narrator.

Miffy is sometimes assumed to be a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] character, because [[Sanrio]]'s [[Hello Kitty]], introduced in 1974, is rendered using a similar line style. The Miffy brand is popular in [[Japan]], with strong sales of Japanese-made Miffy merchandise. In an interview for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Bruna expressed his dislike for Hello Kitty. &quot;'That,' he says darkly, 'is a copy [of Miffy], I think. I don't like that at all. I always think, &quot;No, don't do that. Try to make something that you think of yourself&quot;.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3557810/Dick-Bruna-creator-of-the-Miffy-books-talks-about-his-life-and-work.html |title=Dick Bruna, creator of the Miffy books, talks about his life and work |date=July 31, 2008 |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=18 September 2010 |location=London |first=H. |last=Harrod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, on August 26, 2010, Mercis BV, representing Bruna, brought suit against Sanrio with the claim that one of Hello Kitty's companion characters, a rabbit named Cathy, infringes on the copyright and trademark of Miffy.&lt;ref name=miffysuit&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.sanrio.co.jp/rs/english/corporate/ir/detail/20101104.pdf | title=Announcement of Provisional Disposition Order Against Sanrio | publisher=Sanrio Company, Ltd. | date=November 4, 2010 | accessdate=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, 2010, a Dutch court ruled against Sanrio and ordered the company to stop marketing Cathy products in [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=miffysuit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Kollewe | first=J. | title=Miffy biffs Cathy in Kitty copycat case | newspaper=The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/04/cathy-infringes-miffy-copyright-case | accessdate=May 16, 2011 | location=London | date=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Dawson | first=C. |author2=K.

In Bruna's hometown, [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], there is a square named after Nijntje, the Nijntjepleintje (lit: Little Nijntje Square, to retain the rhyme) and in 2006, the [[Centraal Museum]] opened a permanent exhibition, the ''dick bruna huis'' (Dick Bruna house).&lt;ref&gt;[http://centraalmuseum.nl/en/visit/locations/dick-bruna-house/ ''dick bruna huis''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420070814/http://centraalmuseum.nl/en/visit/locations/dick-bruna-house/ |date=2015-04-20 }} Centraal Museum, Utrecht.&lt;!--PLEASE LEAVE THIS IN LOWER CASE! check reference for explanation--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Miffy celebrated her fiftieth birthday in 2005. This was marked in cities across the globe, for example, at the [[Manchester Art Gallery]] in England. She also serves a &quot;celebrity character spokesperson&quot; for [[Unicef]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/news/press/2007_03_16.html |title=Miffy exhibition comes to Edinburgh |date=March 16, 2007 |publisher=[[National Library of Scotland]] |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711114730/http://www.nls.uk/news/press/2007_03_16.html |archivedate=July 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miffy's namesakes include a new species of [[Psocoptera|booklouse]] from [[Peru]]. The insect was given the scientific name ''Trichadenotecnum miffy'' in 2008, because its epiproct, an appendage on its abdomen, resembles a small rabbit.&lt;ref name=booklouse&gt;Yoshizawa, K., et al. (2008).

(pg. 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Bruna announced his retirement; the rights to the Miffy character will not be sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nltimes.nl/2014/07/30/nijntje-creator-dick-bruna-retires/ | title=Nijntje creator Dick Bruna retires | work=NLTimes | date=30 July 2014 | accessdate=31 July 2014 | author=Zech, Maxime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tonya Maxene Price''' (née '''Harding'''; born November 12, 1970) is a former American [[figure skating|figure skater]], retired boxer, and reality television personality. Born in [[Portland, Oregon]], Harding was raised primarily by her mother, who enrolled her in ice skating lessons beginning at four years old. Harding spent much of her early life training, eventually dropping out of high school to devote her time to the sport. After climbing the ranks in the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] between 1986 and 1989, Harding won the 1989 [[Skate America]] competition. She had been the 1991 and 1994 U.S. champion before being stripped of her 1994 title, and 1991 [[1991 World Figure Skating Championships|World silver medalist]]. In 1991, she earned distinction as being the first American woman to successfully land a triple [[Axel jump|Axel]] in competition, and the second woman to do so in history (behind [[Midori Ito]]). Harding is a two-time Olympian and a two-time Skate America Champion.

In January 1994, Harding became embroiled in controversy when her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, orchestrated [[1994 Cobo Arena attack|an attack]] on her fellow U.S. skating rival [[Nancy Kerrigan]]. Both women then competed in the February [[1994 Winter Olympics]], where Kerrigan won the silver medal and Harding finished eighth. On March 16, 1994, Harding accepted a [[plea bargain]] in which she pleaded guilty to [[obstruction of justice|conspiracy to hinder prosecution]]. As a result of her involvement in the assault on Kerrigan, the [[U.S. Figure Skating|United States Figure Skating Association]] banned her for life on June 30, 1994.

In the early 2000s, Harding competed as a [[Women's boxing|professional boxer]], and her life had been the subject of numerous films, documentaries, books, and academic studies. In 2014, two [[television documentary|television documentaries]] were produced about Harding's life and skating career (''Nancy &amp; Tonya'' and ''The Price of Gold'') and aired within two months of each other – inspiring [[Steven Rogers (screenwriter)|Steven Rogers]] to write the 2017 film ''[[I, Tonya|I,&amp;nbsp;Tonya]]'', starring [[Margot Robbie]] as Harding. In 2018, she was a contestant on [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 26)|season 26]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', finishing in third place.

During her youth, Harding also hunted, drag raced, and learned automotive mechanics from her father. He held various odd jobs including managing apartments, driving a truck, and working at a bait-and-tackle store – yet was often [[Underemployment|underemployed]] due to poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://time.com/5045902/tonya-harding-nancy-kerrigan-1994/|title=Tonya Harding's World might have been Nothing Like Nancy Kerrigan's|last=Rothman|first=Lily|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|location=New York City|date=Dec 8, 2017|access-date=July 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719033759/http://time.com/5045902/tonya-harding-nancy-kerrigan-1994/|archive-date=July 19, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaVona struggled to support the family while working as a waitress, and hand-sewed her daughter's skating costumes as they could not afford to purchase them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-poisoned-ice-vol-41-no-3/|title=Poisoned Ice|last1=Plummer|first1=William|last2=Reed|first2=Susan|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=January 24, 1994|access-date=July 7, 2018|number=3|volume=41|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707202146/https://people.com/archive/cover-story-poisoned-ice-vol-41-no-3/|archive-date=July 7, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding's parents divorced after 19 years of marriage in 1987, when she was 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RiUDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|first2=Tonya|last2=Harding|title=Tonya Tapes|date=2008|page=40|publisher=World Audience|location=New York City|isbn=9781544627809|quote=[My parents] divorced in 1987.

Harding claimed she was frequently abused by her mother. She stated that by the time she was seven years old, physical and psychological abuse had become a regular part of her life.

== Skating career ==
Harding trained as a figure skater throughout her youth with coach Diane Rawlinson. In the mid-1980s, she began working her way up the competitive skating ladder. She placed sixth at the 1986 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, fifth in 1987 and 1988, and third in 1989. After competing in the February [[1989 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|1989 Nationals Championship]], Harding began training with Dody Teachman as her coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hersh&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-03-04/sports/9201200938_1_diane-rawlinson-dody-teachman-tonya-harding|title=Skater Changes Coaches, Again|first=Phil|last=Hersh|work=Chicago Tribune|date=March 4, 1992|access-date=August 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805233735/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-03-04/sports/9201200938_1_diane-rawlinson-dody-teachman-tonya-harding|archive-date=August 5, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RiUDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse |last2=Harding|title=Tonya Tapes|year=2008|page=26|isbn=9781544627809|access-date=August 3, 2018|quote=Who was your coach...through your amateur years? *'Diane...then Dody Teachman was my other coach – when I came into my 18 year old teenage years thinking I knew everything...'*}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then won the October [[1989 Skate America]] competition, and was considered a strong contender at the February [[1990 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]].

Harding's breakthrough year came in 1991 when, at the [[1991 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]], she completed her first [[triple Axel]] in competition on February 16 – the first American woman to execute the jump.&lt;ref name=nyt910312&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/sports/figure-skating-a-triple-axel-with-rippling-effects.html |title=A Triple Axel With Rippling Effects |first=Michael |last=Janofsky |work=The New York Times |date=March 12, 1991 |access-date=December 22, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171226224921/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/sports/figure-skating-a-triple-axel-with-rippling-effects.html |archive-date=December 26, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; She landed seven triple jumps in the long program including the triple Axel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/10/magazine/power-skating.html|title=Power Skating|last=Lubarsky|first=Jared|date=March 10, 1991|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616191555/https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/10/magazine/power-skating.html|archive-date=June 16, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She won the 1991 U.S. Ladies' Singles title with the event's first 6.0 technical merit score since [[Janet Lynn]]'s 1973 performance at the U.S. Championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;  She won the long program when seven of the nine judges gave her first place, and in doing so won the whole competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1991/02/17/hardings-7-triples-nail-us-title-put-skating-world-in-whirl/3e847b63-6d16-4c13-b197-9fed67677fdf/?noredirect=on|title=Harding's Seven Triples Nail U.S. Title, Put Skating World in a Whirl|last=Brennan|first=Christine|date=February 17, 1991|work=The Washington Post|access-date=June 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She scored eight 5.9s and one 6.0 for technical merit and six 5.9s, one 5.8 and two 5.7s for composition and style.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  At the March 1991 World Championships, an international event, she again completed the triple Axel.

* The first woman to complete a triple Axel in the short program
* The first woman to successfully execute two triple Axels in a single competition
* The first ever to complete a triple Axel in combination (with the double [[toe loop]])

Despite these record-breaking performances, after 1991, Harding was never again able to successfully complete the triple Axel in competition; her competitive results began to decline.

The immediate aftermath of the attack was recorded on a news camera and broadcast around the world. The assailant was Shane Stant, contracted to break her right leg; he turned himself in to Phoenix [[FBI]] on January 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;anatomy of plot&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;heldin&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/history/timeline/articles/time_011594.htm|first=William|last=Hamilton|title=Three Held in Assault on Kerrigan|work=The Washington Post|date=Jan 15, 1994|access-date=August 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316112130/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/history/timeline/articles/time_011594.htm|archive-date=March 16, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/15/sports/third-suspect-arrested-by-fbi-in-the-attack-on-olympic-skater.html|first=Micheal|last=Janofsky|title=Third Suspect Arrested by F.B.I.

In 1663 and 1664, Hooke produced his microscopy observations, subsequently collated in ''[[Micrographia]]'' in 1665.

On 20 March 1664, Hooke succeeded Arthur Dacres as [[Gresham Professor of Geometry]].  Hooke received the degree of &quot;Doctor of Physic&quot; in December 1691.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = De Milt, Clara | title = Robert Hooke, Chemist | journal = Journal of Chemical Education |date=November 1939 | volume = 16 | pages = 503–510| doi = 10.1021/ed016p503|bibcode = 1939JChEd..16..503D| issue = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hooke and Newcomen===
There is a widely reported but seemingly incorrect story that Dr Hooke corresponded with [[Thomas Newcomen]] in connection with Newcomen's invention of the [[steam engine]]. This story was discussed by Rhys Jenkins, a past President of the Newcomen Society, in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;“The Heat Engine Idea in the Seventeenth Century” Rhys Jenkins, Paper read to the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents, 21 October 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins traced the origin of the story to an article &quot;Steam Engines&quot; by Dr. [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]] (1739–1805) in the third edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica”, which says ''There are to be found among Hooke's papers, in the possession of the Royal Society, some notes of observations, for the use of Newcomen, his countryman, on [[Denis Papin|Papin]]'s boasted method of transmitting to a great distance the action of an mill by means of pipes'', and that Hooke had dissuaded Newcomen from erecting a machine on this principle. Jenkins points out a number of errors in Robison's article, and questions whether the correspondent might in fact have been Newton, whom Hooke is known to have corresponded with, the name being misread as Newcomen. A search by Mr. H W Dickinson of Hooke's papers held by the Royal Society, which had been bound together in the middle of the 18th century, i.e. before Robison's time, and carefully preserved since, revealed no trace of any correspondence between Hooke and Newcomen. Jenkins concluded ''... this story must be omitted from the history of the steam engine, at any rate until documentary evidence is forthcoming.''

In the intervening years since 1936 no such evidence has been found, but the story persists. For instance, in a book published in 2011 it is said that ''in a letter dated 1703 Hooke did suggest that Newcomen use condensing steam to drive the piston.''&lt;ref&gt;

==Personality and disputes==
Reputedly,{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Hooke was a staunch friend and ally. In his early training at [[Wadham College]], he was among ardent [[royalist]]s, particularly [[Christopher Wren]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Yet allegedly,{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Hooke was also proud, and often annoyed by intellectual competitors. Hooke contended that [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] had leaked details of Hooke's [[anchor escapement|watch escapement]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Otherwise, Hooke guarded his own ideas and used [[ciphers]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

On the other hand, as the Royal Society's curator of experiments, Hooke was tasked to demonstrate many ideas sent in to the Society. Some evidence suggests that Hooke subsequently assumed credit for some of these ideas.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Yet in this period of immense scientific progress, numerous ideas were developed in multiple places roughly simultaneously. Immensely busy, Hook let many of his own ideas remain undeveloped, although others he patented.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Perhaps more significantly, Hooke and [[Isaac Newton]] disputed over credit for certain breakthroughs in physical science, including gravitation, astronomy, and optics.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} After Hooke's death, Newton questioned his legacy. And as the Royal Society's president, Newton allegedly destroyed or failed to preserve the only known portrait of Hooke.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} In the 20th century, researchers [[Robert Gunther]] and Margaret 'Espinasse revived Hooke's legacy, establishing Hooke among the most influential scientists of his time.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the 2003 Hooke meeting at the University of Oxford: {{cite web| title = Robert Hooke Day at Christ Church, Oxford | url = http://hooke.chem.ox.ac.uk/ | accessdate = 23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Espinasse1956 /&gt;

None of this should distract from Hooke's inventiveness, his remarkable experimental facility, and his capacity for hard work. His ideas about gravitation, and his claim of priority for the inverse square law, are outlined below.  He was granted a large number of patents for inventions and refinements in the fields of elasticity, optics, and barometry. The Royal Society's Hooke papers, rediscovered in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/4854554.stm | title=Auction deal saves £1m manuscript | work = BBC News | date=  28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (after disappearing when Newton took over) may open up a modern reassessment.

[[File:Louse diagram, Micrographia, Robert Hooke, 1667.jpg|thumb|upright|Engraving of a [[louse]] from Hooke's ''[[Micrographia]]'']]
Much has been written about the unpleasant side of Hooke's personality, starting with comments by his first biographer, Richard Waller, that Hooke was &quot;in person, but despicable&quot; and &quot;melancholy, mistrustful, and jealous.&quot;&lt;ref name=Waller/&gt; Waller's comments influenced other writers for well over two centuries, so that a picture of Hooke as a disgruntled, selfish, anti-social curmudgeon dominates many older books and articles.  For example, Arthur Berry said that Hooke &quot;claimed credit for most of the scientific discoveries of the time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Berry | first = Arthur | title = A Short History of Astronomy | publisher = John Murray | location = London | year = 1898 | page = 221}}- See also the reprint published by Dover in 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan wrote that Hooke was &quot;positively unscrupulous&quot; and possessing an &quot;uneasy apprehensive vanity&quot; in dealings with Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sullivan | first = J. W. N. | title = Isaac Newton 1642–1727 | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York  | year = 1938 | pages = 35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel used the phrase &quot;cantankerous, envious, vengeful&quot; in his description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Manuel | first = Frank E. | title = A Portrait of Isaac Newton | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1968 | page = 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; More described Hooke having both a &quot;cynical temperament&quot; and a &quot;caustic tongue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = More | first = Louis Trenchard | title = Isaac Newton  | publisher = Charles Schribner's Sons | location = New York | year = 1934 | pages = 94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrade was more sympathetic, but still used the adjectives &quot;difficult&quot;, &quot;suspicious&quot;, and &quot;irritable&quot; in describing Hooke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Andrarde | first = E. N. De C. | title = Isaac Newton  | publisher = Chanticleer Press | location = New York  | year = 1950 | pages = 56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of Hooke's diary in 1935&lt;ref name=Robinson1935&gt;{{Cite book| first = Robert | last = Hooke | editor-last = Robinson | editor-first = H. W. | editor2-last = Adams | editor2-first = W. | title = The Diary of Robert Hooke, M.A., M.D., F.R.S., 1672–1680 | year = 1935 | place = London | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis }}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed other sides of the man that 'Espinasse, in particular, has detailed carefully.  She writes that &quot;the picture which is usually painted of Hooke as a morose and envious recluse is completely false.&quot;&lt;ref name=Espinasse1956&gt;{{Cite book| last = 'Espinasse | first = Margaret | title = Robert Hooke | publisher = William Heinemann Ltd. | year = 1956 | location = London | page = 106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke interacted with noted craftsmen such as [[Thomas Tompion]], the clockmaker, and Christopher Cocks (Cox), an instrument maker.  Hooke often met [[Christopher Wren]], with whom he shared many interests, and had a lasting friendship with [[John Aubrey]].  Hooke's diaries also make frequent reference to meetings at coffeehouses and taverns, and to dinners with Robert Boyle.  He took tea on many occasions with his lab assistant, Harry Hunt.  Within his family, Hooke took both a niece and a cousin into his home, teaching them mathematics.

Robert Hooke spent his life largely on the Isle of Wight, at Oxford, and in London.  He never married, but his diary records that he had sexual relations with his niece, Grace, and several of his housekeepers. He at one point records that one of these housekeepers gave birth to a girl, but doesn't note the paternity of the child.&lt;ref name=Robinson1935 /&gt;  On 3 March 1703, Hooke died in London, and a chest containing £8,000 in money and gold was found in his room at [[Gresham College]].{{efn|About £{{inflation|UK|8000|1703|r=-3|fmt=c}} today.}} Although he had talked of leaving a generous bequest to the Royal Society which would have given his name to a library, laboratory and lectures, no will was found and the money passed to an illiterate cousin, Elizabeth Stephens.{{sfn|Inwood|2002|pp=1,2}}  He was buried at [[St Helen's Bishopsgate]], but the precise location of his grave is unknown.

==Science==
[[File:HookeFlea01.jpg|thumb|Hooke's drawing of a [[flea]]]]

===Mechanics===
In 1660, Hooke discovered [[Hooke's law|the law]] of [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] which bears his name and which describes the linear variation of [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] with extension in an [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic]] spring.  He first described this discovery in the anagram &quot;ceiiinosssttuv&quot;, whose solution he published in 1678&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hooke, ''De Potentia Restitutiva, or of Spring. Explaining the Power of Springing Bodies'', London, 1678.&lt;/ref&gt; as &quot;Ut tensio, sic vis&quot; meaning &quot;As the extension, so the force.&quot;  Hooke's work on elasticity culminated, for practical purposes, in his development of the [[balance spring]] or hairspring, which for the first time enabled a portable timepiece&amp;nbsp;– a watch&amp;nbsp;– to keep time with reasonable accuracy.  A bitter dispute between Hooke and [[Christiaan Huygens]] on the priority of this invention was to continue for centuries after the death of both; but a note dated 23 June 1670 in the Hooke Folio (see ''External links'' below), describing a demonstration of a balance-controlled watch before the Royal Society, has been held to favour Hooke's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapps.qmul.ac.uk/cell/Hooke/hooke_folio.php?id=80&amp;option=both |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120718125416/http://webapps.qmul.ac.uk/cell/Hooke/hooke_folio.php?id=80&amp;option=both |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 July 2012 |title=Hooke Folio Online |publisher=Webapps.qmul.ac.uk |access-date=10 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RobertHookeMicrographia1665.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cell structure of [[Cork (material)|cork]] by Hooke]]
It is interesting{{to whom|date=July 2018}} from a twentieth-century vantage point that Hooke first announced his law of elasticity as an [[anagram]].  This was a method sometimes used by scientists, such as Hooke, Huygens, [[Galileo]], and others, to establish priority for a discovery without revealing details.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Hooke became Curator of Experiments in 1662 to the newly founded Royal Society, and took responsibility for experiments performed at its weekly meetings.  This was a position he held for over 40 years.  While this position kept him in the thick of science in Britain and beyond, it also led to some heated arguments with other scientists, such as Huygens (see above) and particularly with [[Isaac Newton]] and the Royal Society's [[Henry Oldenburg]].  In 1664 Hooke also was appointed Professor of [[Geometry]] at [[Gresham College]] in London and Cutlerian Lecturer in Mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = 'Espinasse | first = Margaret | title = Robert Hooke | publisher = William Heinemann Ltd. | year = 1956 | location = London | page = 187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 1680, Hooke observed the [[Cymatics|nodal patterns]] associated with the [[normal mode|modes of vibration]] of glass plates. He ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with flour, and saw the nodal patterns emerge.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;[http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/html/chladni.html Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514140121/http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/html/chladni.html |date=14 May 2011 }}, [http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/about/index.html Institute for Learning Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111135833/http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/about/index.html |date=11 November 2007 }}, [[Columbia University]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Scientists'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 101, {{ISBN|7810802259}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In acoustics, in 1681 he showed the Royal Society that musical tones could be generated from spinning brass cogs cut with teeth in particular proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline |last=Greated |first=Clive |title=Robert Hooke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravitation===
While many of his contemporaries believed in the [[aether theories|aether]] as a medium for transmitting attraction or repulsion between separated celestial bodies, Hooke argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in ''[[Micrographia]]'' (1665). Hooke's 1666 [[Royal Society]] lecture on gravity added two further principles: that all bodies move in straight lines till deflected by some force and that the attractive force is stronger for closer bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Birch, ''The History of the Royal Society of London'', … (London, England:  1756), vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lWEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 68–73]; see especially pages 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dugald Stewart]] quoted Hooke's own words on his system of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Dugald (1877) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OAwRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA304 ''Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind''], T. &amp; T. Clark, Vol. 2, Ch. 2, Section 4.2 (pp. 304 ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I will explain,&quot; says Hooke, in a communication to the Royal Society in 1666, &quot;a system of the world very different from any yet received. It is founded on the following positions. 1. That all the heavenly bodies have not only a gravitation of their parts to their own proper centre, but that they also mutually attract each other within their spheres of action. 2. That all bodies having a simple motion, will continue to move in a straight line, unless continually deflected from it by some extraneous force, causing them to describe a circle, an ellipse, or some other curve. 3. That this attraction is so much the greater as the bodies are nearer. As to the proportion in which those forces diminish by an increase of distance, I own I have not discovered it....&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hooke's 1670 Gresham lecture explained that gravitation applied to &quot;all celestial bodies&quot; and added the principles that the gravitating power decreases with distance and that in the absence of any such power bodies move in straight lines.

Hooke published his ideas about the &quot;System of the World&quot; again in somewhat developed form in 1674, as an addition to &quot;An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations&quot;.&lt;ref name=attempt&gt;Hooke's 1674 statement in &quot;An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations&quot;, is available in [http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView/ECHOzogiLib?mode=imagepath&amp;url=/mpiwg/online/permanent/library/XXTBUC3U/pageimg online facsimile here].&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions between the Sun and planets, in a way that increased with nearness to the attracting body.

Hooke's statements up to 1674 made no mention, however, that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions.  Hooke's gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke also did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration.  On these two aspects, Hooke stated in 1674: &quot;Now what these several degrees [of gravitational attraction] are I have not yet experimentally verified&quot; (indicating that he did not yet know what law the gravitation might follow); and as to his whole proposal: &quot;This I only hint at present&quot;, &quot;having my self many other things in hand which I would first compleat, and therefore cannot so well attend it&quot; (i.e. &quot;prosecuting this Inquiry&quot;).&lt;ref name=attempt /&gt;

In November 1679, Hooke initiated a remarkable exchange of letters with Newton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iliffe, Rob |title=Newton:A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8KyKP1T-sYC&amp;pg=PT140|year= 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-157902-8|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of which the full text is now published).&lt;ref name=167986letters&gt;Turnbull, H W (ed.) (1960), ''Correspondence of Isaac Newton'', Vol. 2 (1676–1687), Cambridge University Press, giving the Hooke-Newton correspondence (of November 1679 to January 1679/80) at pp. 297–314, and the 1686 correspondence over Hooke's priority claim at pp. 431–448.&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke's ostensible purpose was to tell Newton that Hooke had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, H W (ed.) (1960), ''Correspondence of Isaac Newton'', Vol. 2 (1676–1687), Cambridge University Press, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke therefore wanted to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others; and as if to whet Newton's interest, he asked what Newton thought about various matters, giving a whole list, mentioning &quot;compounding the celestial motions of the planetts of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body&quot;, and &quot;my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse&quot;, and then a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions (which Hooke described at length), and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys, the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge, and other items.   Newton's reply offered &quot;a fansy of my own&quot; about a terrestrial experiment (not a proposal about celestial motions) which might detect the Earth's motion, by the use of a body first suspended in air and then dropped to let it fall.  The main point was to indicate how Newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the Earth's motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical, but he went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid Earth had not been in the way (on a spiral path to the centre). Hooke disagreed with Newton's idea of how the body would continue to move.{{efn|Several commentators{{who|date=November 2018}} have followed Hooke in calling Newton's spiral path mistaken, or even a 'blunder', but there are also the facts: (a) that Hooke left out of account Newton's specific statement that the motion resulted from dropping &quot;a heavy body suspended in the Air&quot; (i.e. a resisting medium), see Newton to Hooke, 28 November 1679, document #236 at p. 301, 'Correspondence' vol. 2 cited above, and compare Hooke's report to the Royal Society on 11 December 1679 where Hooke reported the matter &quot;supposing no resistance&quot;, see D Gjertsen, 'Newton Handbook' (1986), at p. 259; and (b) that Hooke's reply of 9 December 1679 to Newton considered the cases of motion both with and without air resistance: The resistance-free path was what Hooke called an 'elliptueid'; but a line in Hooke's diagram showing the path for his case of air resistance was, though elongated, also another inward-spiralling path ending at the Earth's centre: Hooke wrote &quot;where the Medium ... has a power of impeding and destroying its motion the curve in which it would move would be some what like the Line AIKLMNOP &amp;c and ... would terminate in the center C&quot;. Hooke's path including air resistance was therefore to this extent like Newton's (see 'Correspondence' vol.2, cited above, at pp. 304–306, document #237, with accompanying figure). The diagrams are also online: see Wilson, p. 241, showing Newton's 1679 diagram with spiral,&lt;ref&gt;R. Taton, C. Wilson, Michael Hoskin (eds), ''Planetary Astronomy from the Renaissance to the Rise of Astrophysics, Part A, Tycho Brahe to Newton'',Cambridge University Press 2003, {{ISBN|9780521542050}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA241 page 241]&lt;/ref&gt; and extract of his letter; also Wilson, p. 242 showing Hooke's 1679 diagram including two paths, closed curve and spiral.&lt;ref&gt;R. Taton, C. Wilson, Michael Hoskin (eds), ''Planetary Astronomy from the Renaissance to the Rise of Astrophysics, Part A, Tycho Brahe to Newton'',Cambridge University Press 2003, {{ISBN|9780521542050}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA242 page 242]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton pointed out in his later correspondence over the priority claim that the descent in a spiral &quot;is true in a resisting medium such as our air is&quot;, see 'Correspondence', vol. 2 cited above, at p. 433, document #286.}} A short further correspondence developed, and towards the end of it Hooke, writing on 6 January 1679|80 to Newton, communicated his &quot;supposition ... that the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the Distance from the Center Reciprocall, and Consequently that the Velocity will be in a subduplicate proportion to the Attraction and Consequently as Kepler Supposes Reciprocall to the Distance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See p. 309 in 'Correspondence of Isaac Newton', Vol. 2 cited above, at document #239.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hooke's inference about the velocity was actually incorrect)&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1686, when the first book of Newton's ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was presented to the Royal Society, Hooke claimed that he had given Newton the &quot;notion&quot; of &quot;the rule of the decrease of Gravity, being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the Center&quot;.  At the same time (according to [[Edmond Halley]]'s contemporary report) Hooke agreed that &quot;the Demonstration of the Curves generated therby&quot; was wholly Newton's.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

A recent assessment about the early history of the inverse square law is that &quot;by the late 1660s,&quot; the assumption of an &quot;inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gal, Ofer (2002) ''Meanest foundations and nobler superstructures: Hooke, Newton and the 'Compounding of the Celestiall Motions of the Planetts'', Springer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0nKYlXxIemoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA9 p. 9], {{ISBN|1402007329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton himself had shown in the 1660s that for planetary motion under a circular assumption, force in the radial direction had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whiteside, D T |title=The pre-history of the 'Principia' from 1664 to 1686|jstor=531520|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1991.0002 |journal= Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 45|issue=1|year=1991|pages =11–61 (13–20)|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton, faced in May 1686 with Hooke's claim on the inverse square law, denied that Hooke was to be credited as author of the idea, giving reasons including the citation of prior work by others before Hooke.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt; Newton also firmly claimed that even if it had happened that he had first heard of the inverse square proportion from Hooke, which it had not, he would still have some rights to it in view of his mathematical developments and demonstrations, which enabled observations to be relied on as evidence of its accuracy, while Hooke, without mathematical demonstrations and evidence in favour of the supposition, could only guess (according to Newton) that it was approximately valid &quot;at great distances from the center&quot;.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

On the other hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all editions of the ''Principia'', that Hooke (but not exclusively Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system.  Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 1729 English translation of the 'Principia', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66 p. 66].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, but that did not mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: &quot;yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things &amp; for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it.&quot;&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

One of the contrasts between the two men was that Newton was primarily a pioneer in mathematical analysis and its applications as well as optical experimentation, while Hooke was a creative experimenter of such great range, that it is not surprising to find that he left some of his ideas, such as those about gravitation, undeveloped.  This in turn makes it understandable how in 1759, decades after the deaths of both Newton and Hooke, [[Alexis Clairaut]], mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, made his assessment after reviewing what Hooke had published on gravitation.  &quot;One must not think that this idea ... of Hooke diminishes Newton's glory&quot;, Clairaut wrote; &quot;The example of Hooke&quot; serves &quot;to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The second extract is quoted and translated in W.W. Rouse Ball, &quot;An Essay on Newton's 'Principia'&quot; (London and New York: Macmillan, 1893), at p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original statements by Clairaut (in French) are found (with orthography here as in the original) in &quot;Explication abregée du systême du monde, et explication des principaux phénomenes astronomiques tirée des Principes de M. Newton&quot; (1759), at Introduction (section IX), p. 6: &quot;Il ne faut pas croire que cette idée ... de Hook diminue la gloire de M. Newton&quot;, [and] &quot;L'exemple de Hook&quot; [serves] &quot;à faire voir quelle distance il y a entre une vérité entrevue &amp; une vérité démontrée&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horology===
Hooke made tremendously important contributions to the science of timekeeping, being intimately involved in the advances of his time; the introduction of the pendulum as a better regulator for clocks, the balance spring to improve the timekeeping of watches, and the proposal that a precise timekeeper could be used to find the longitude at sea.

====Anchor escapement====
[[File:Anchor Escapement.png|thumb|upright|[[Anchor escapement]]]]

In 1655, according to his autobiographical notes, Hooke began to acquaint himself with astronomy, through the good offices of John Ward.  Hooke applied himself to the improvement of the [[pendulum]] and in 1657 or 1658, he began to improve on pendulum mechanisms, studying the work of [[Giovanni Riccioli]], and going on to study both gravitation and the mechanics of timekeeping.

Henry Sully, writing in Paris in 1717, described the [[anchor escapement]] as ''an admirable invention of which Dr. Hooke, formerly professor of geometry in Gresham College at London, was the inventor.''&lt;ref&gt;Sully, H and Le Roy, J (1737) ''Regle artificielle des tems'', G. Dupuis, Paris, ch. 1, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Derham]] also attributes it to Hooke.&lt;ref&gt;Derham, William (1734) ''The artificial clock maker'', James, John and Paul Knapton. at the Crown, in Ludgate Street., p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke recorded that he conceived of a way to determine [[longitude]] (then a critical problem for navigation), and with the help of Boyle and others he attempted to patent it.  In the process, Hooke demonstrated a pocket-watch of his own devising, fitted with a [[coil spring]] attached to the arbour of the balance.  Hooke's ultimate failure to secure sufficiently lucrative terms for the exploitation of this idea resulted in its being shelved, and evidently caused him to become more jealous of his inventions.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Hooke developed the [[balance spring]] independently of and at least 5 years before [[Christiaan Huygens]],&lt;ref&gt;Ian Sample, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/09/science.research &quot;Eureka! Lost manuscript found in cupboard&quot;], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who published his own work in ''Journal de Scavans'' in February 1675.

===Microscopy===
[[File:Hooke Microscope-03000276-FIG-4.jpg|thumb|upright|Hooke's microscope]]
Hooke's 1665 book ''[[Micrographia]]'', describing observations with [[microscope]]s and [[telescope]]s, as well as original work in [[biology]], contains the earliest of an observed microorganism, a microfungus ''[[Mucor]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;  Hooke coined the term ''[[cell (biology)|cell]]'', suggesting plant structure's resemblance to [[honeycomb]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooke|first1=Robert|title=Micrographia: Or Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses, with Observations and Inquiries Thereupon|date=1665|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0486495644|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DYXk_9XX38C&amp;q=Micrographia+honeycomb&amp;pg=PA113|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hand-crafted, leather and gold-tooled microscope he used to make the observations for ''Micrographia'', originally constructed by Christopher White in London, is on display at the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine]] in [[Maryland]].

''Micrographia'' also contains Hooke's, or perhaps Boyle and Hooke's, ideas on combustion.  Hooke's experiments led him to conclude that combustion involves a substance that is mixed with air, a statement with which modern scientists would agree, but that was not understood widely, if at all, in the seventeenth century.  Hooke went on to conclude that respiration also involves a specific component of the air.&lt;ref&gt;See particularly Observation 16 of ''Micrographia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Partington even goes so far as to claim that if &quot;Hooke had continued his experiments on combustion it is probable that he would have discovered [[oxygen]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Partington, J. P. | title = A Short History of Chemistry | year = 1951 | edition = 2nd| publisher = Macmillan and Company | location = London | pages = 78–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palaeontology===
[[File:Moon Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|upright|Drawings of the [[Moon]] and the [[Pleiades]] from Hooke's ''[[Micrographia]]'']]
One of the observations in ''Micrographia'' was of [[petrified wood|fossil wood]], the microscopic structure of which he compared to ordinary wood. This led him to conclude that fossilised objects like petrified wood and fossil shells, such as [[Ammonites]], were the remains of living things that had been soaked in petrifying water laden with minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudwick|first=Martin J.S.|authorlink=Martin J. S. Rudwick|title=The Meaning of Fossils|year=1976|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke believed that such fossils provided reliable clues to the past history of life on Earth, and, despite the objections of contemporary naturalists like [[John Ray]] who found the concept of [[extinction]] theologically unacceptable, that in some cases they might represent species that had become extinct through some geological disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|authorlink=Peter J. Bowler|title=The Earth Encompassed|year=1992|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]] wrote the following in his [[q:Charles Lyell#Principles of geology (1832) Vol.1|''Principles of Geology'']] (1832).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke M.D.,'... appeared in 1705, containing 'A Discourse of Earthquakes'... His treatise... is the most philosophical production of that age, in regard to the causes of former changes in the organic and inorganic kingdoms of nature. 'However trivial a thing,' he says, 'a rotten shell may appear to some, yet these monuments of nature are more certain tokens of antiquity than coins or medals, since the best of those may be counterfeited or made by art and design, as may also books, manuscripts, and inscriptions, as all the learned are now sufficiently satisfied has often been actually practised,' &amp;c.; 'and though it must be granted that it is very difficult to read them and to raise a chronology out of them, and to state the intervals of the time wherein such or such catastrophes and mutations have happened, yet it is not impossible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Astronomy===
[[File:Saturn Robert Hooke 1666.jpg|thumb|left|Hooke noted the shadows (a and b) cast by both the globe and the rings on each other in this drawing of [[Saturn]].]]

One of the more-challenging problems tackled by Hooke was the measurement of the distance to a star (other than the Sun).  The star chosen was [[Gamma Draconis]] and the method to be used was [[parallax]] determination.  After several months of observing, in 1669, Hooke believed that the desired result had been achieved.  It is now known that Hooke's equipment was far too imprecise to allow the measurement to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Hirshfeld, Alan W. | title = Parallax, The Race to Measure the Cosmos | isbn = 978-0716737117 | year = 2001 | publisher = W.

Hooke's activities in astronomy extended beyond the study of stellar distance.  His ''Micrographia'' contains illustrations of the [[Pleiades]] star cluster as well as of [[lunar craters]].  He performed experiments to study how such craters might have formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Ashbrook, Joseph |isbn=978-0521106047| title = The Astronomical Scrapbook | year = 1984 | place = Cambridge, Massachusetts | publisher = Sky Publishing Corporation | pages = 240–241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke also was an early observer of the [[rings of Saturn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Alexander, A.

===Memory===
A lesser-known contribution, however one of the first of its kind, was Hooke's scientific model of human [[memory]].  Hooke in a 1682 lecture to the Royal Society proposed a mechanistic model of human memory, which would bear little resemblance to the mainly philosophical models before it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Singer, B. R. |year=1979|title=Robert Hooke on memory: Association and time perception (I)|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 31|pages= 115–131|jstor=531553|pmid=11609928|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1976.0003|issue=1|s2cid=21409461}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model addressed the components of encoding, memory capacity, repetition, retrieval, and forgetting&amp;nbsp;–  some with surprising modern accuracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hintzman, D. L. 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hintzman, D. L. |year=2003|title=Robert Hooke's model of memory|journal= Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|pmid=12747488|volume= 10|pages= 3–14|doi=10.3758/BF03196465|issue=1|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work, overlooked for nearly 200 years, shared a variety of similarities with [[Richard Semon]]'s work of 1919/1923, both assuming memories were physical and located in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Semon, R. (1923). Mnemic psychology (B. Duffy, Trans.). London: George Allen &amp; Unwin. (Original work published 1919)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, D. L. (2001).

L. 2003&quot;/&gt; This lecture would be published posthumously in 1705 as the memory model was unusually placed in a series of works on the nature of light.  It has been speculated that this work saw little review as the printing was done in small batches in a post-Newtonian age of science and was most likely deemed out of date by the time it was published.  Further interfering with its success was contemporary memory psychologists' rejection of immaterial souls, which Hooke invoked to some degree in regards to the processes of attention, encoding and retrieval.

Hooke was Surveyor to the City of London and chief assistant to [[Christopher Wren]], in which capacity he helped Wren rebuild London after the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] in 1666, and also worked on the design of London's [[Monument to the Great Fire of London|Monument to the fire]], the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]], [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House in Bloomsbury]], and the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] (which became known as 'Bedlam').  Other buildings designed by Hooke include The [[Royal College of Physicians]] (1679), [[Ragley Hall]] in Warwickshire, [[Ramsbury Manor]] in Wiltshire&lt;ref&gt;Inwood, Stephen (28 February 2011). The Man Who Knew Too Much (Kindle Location 8290). Macmillan Publishers UK. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and the parish church of [[Church of St Mary Magdalene, Willen|St Mary Magdalene]] at [[Willen]] in Milton Keynes, [[History of Buckinghamshire|Buckinghamshire]].  Hooke's collaboration with [[Christopher Wren]] also included [[St Paul's Cathedral]], whose dome uses a method of construction conceived by Hooke. Hooke also participated in the design of the [[Pepys Library]], which held the manuscripts of [[Samuel Pepys]]' diaries, the most frequently cited eyewitness account of the Great Fire of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Magdalene Described|first=R.|last=Hyam|publisher=Crampton &amp; Sons Ltd.|location=Sawston, Cambridgeshire, U.K.|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke and Wren both being keen astronomers, the Monument was designed to serve a scientific function as a [[telescope]] for observing [[Transit (astronomy)|transits]], though Hooke's characteristically precise measurements after completion showed that the movement of the column in the wind made it unusable for this purpose. The legacy of this can be observed in the construction of the [[spiral staircase]], which has no central column, and in the observation chamber which remains in place below ground level.

In the reconstruction after the Great Fire, Hooke proposed redesigning London's streets on a grid pattern with wide boulevards and arteries, a pattern subsequently used in the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|renovation of Paris]], Liverpool, and many American cities.  This proposal was thwarted by arguments over property rights, as property owners were surreptitiously shifting their boundaries.  Hooke was in demand to settle many of these disputes, due to his competence as a surveyor and his tact as an arbitrator.

For an extensive study of Hooke's architectural work, see the book by Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Cooper | first = Michael | title = A More Beautiful City: Robert Hooke and the Rebuilding of London after the Great Fire | publisher = Sutton Publishing Ltd. | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-7509-2959-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Likenesses==
[[File:Jan Baptist van Helmont portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait thought for a time to be Hooke, but almost certainly [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]]]]
No authenticated portrait of Robert Hooke exists. This situation has sometimes been attributed to the heated conflicts between Hooke and Newton, although Hooke's biographer Allan Chapman rejects as a myth the claims that Newton or his acolytes deliberately destroyed Hooke's portrait. German antiquarian and scholar [[Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach]] visited the Royal Society in 1710 and his account of his visit specifically mentions him being shown the portraits of 'Boyle and Hoock' (which were said to be good likenesses), but while Boyle's portrait survives, Hooke's has evidently been lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;rod.beavon.clara.net&quot;&gt;[http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/leonardo.htm Allan Chapman, &quot;England's Leonardo: Robert Hooke (1635–1703) and the art of experiment in Restoration England&quot;, lecture from 'Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain', 67, 239–275 (1996), also given at Westminster School as the 1997 Sir Henry Tizard Memorial Lecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030235901/http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/leonardo.htm |date=30 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hooke's time, the Royal Society met at Gresham College, but within a few months of Hooke's death Newton became the Society's president and plans were laid for a new meeting place.  When the move to new quarters finally was made a few years later, in 1710, Hooke's Royal Society portrait went missing, and has yet to be found.

Two contemporary written descriptions of Hooke's appearance have survived. The first was recorded by his close friend [[John Aubrey]], who described Hooke in middle age and at the height of his creative powers:

{{quote|He is but of midling stature, something crooked, pale faced, and his face but little below, but his head is lardge, his eie full and popping, and not quick; a grey eie. He haz a delicate head of haire, browne, and of an excellent moist curle. He is and ever was temperate and moderate in dyet, etc.}}

The second is a rather unflattering description of Hooke as an old man, written by Richard Waller:

{{quote|As to his Person he was but despicable, being very crooked, tho' I have heard from himself, and others, that he was strait till about 16 Years of Age when he first grew awry, by frequent practising, with a Turn-Lath ... He was always very pale and lean, and laterly nothing but Skin and Bone, with a Meagre Aspect, his Eyes grey and full, with a sharp ingenious Look whilst younger; his nose but thin, of a moderate height and length; his Mouth meanly wide, and upper lip thin; his Chin sharp, and Forehead large; his Head of a middle size. He wore his own Hair of a dark Brown colour, very long and hanging neglected over his Face uncut and lank...&lt;ref name=&quot;rod.beavon.clara.net&quot;/&gt;}}

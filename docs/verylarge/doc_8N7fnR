'''Clark County''' is located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 1,951,269, with an estimated population of 2,266,715 in 2019.&lt;ref name=QF&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/PEPANNRES/0500000US32003|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|title=American Factfinder|accessdate=April 24, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213114552/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/PEPANNRES/0500000US32003|archive-date=February 13, 2020|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the county population resides in the Las Vegas Census County Divisions, which hold 1,771,945 people as of the 2010 Census, across 476 square miles (1,233&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nevada: 2010, Summary Population and Housing Characteristics; 2010 Census of Population and Housing |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-1-30.pdf |website=United States Census Bureau |publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration |accessdate=9 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is by far the most populous county in [[Nevada]], accounting for 7% of the state's land area but 74% of the state's population – thus making Nevada one of the most centralized states in the United States.

==History==
[[Las Vegas]], the state's most populous city, has been the [[county seat]] since its establishment. The county was formed by the [[Nevada Legislature]] by splitting off a portion of [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Lincoln County]] on February 5, 1909,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lasvegassun.com/news/2009/jan/04/year-history-county-turns-100/ Las Vegas Sun, January 4, 2009]; Joseph Nathan Kane, ''The American Counties'' (4th Ed.), (The Scarecrow Press, 1983), pp. 479-480&lt;/ref&gt; and was organized on July 1, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Nevada|last=Squires|first=C. P.|publisher=Nevada's Online State News Journal|page=801|url=http://www.nevadaobserver.com/History%20Of%20Clark%20County%20(1912).htm|accessdate=July 25, 2009|editor=Sam P. Davis|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720033737/http://www.nevadaobserver.com/History%20Of%20Clark%20County%20%281912%29.htm|archive-date=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Las Vegas Valley (landform)|Las Vegas Valley]], a {{convert|600|sqmi|abbr=on}} basin, includes Las Vegas and other major cities and communities such as [[North Las Vegas]], [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]], and the [[unincorporated community]] of [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]].

Originally part of the Mexican Territory of [[Alta California]], the Clark County lands were first traversed by American beaver trappers. Word of their journeys inspired the New Mexican merchant [[Antonio Armijo]] in 1829 to establish the first route for mule trains and herds of livestock from [[New Mexico|Nuevo Mexico]] to Alta California through the area, along the [[Virgin River|Virgin]] and [[Colorado River]]s. Called the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)#Armijo Route|Armijo Route]] of the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]], the route was later modified into the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)#Main Route|Main Route]] by the passing merchants, trappers, drovers, Ute raiders and settlers over the years by moving to a more direct route. In Clark County it was northward away from the Colorado to a series of creeks, waterholes and springs like those at [[Las Vegas]], to which [[John C. Frémont]] added [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)#Frémont's Cutoff|Frémont's Cutoff]] on his return from California to Utah in 1844.

What is now Clark County was acquired by the United States during the [[Mexican–American War]], becoming part of the northwestern corner of [[New Mexico Territory]]. In 1847, [[Jefferson Hunt]] and other [[Mormon Battalion]] members returning to [[Salt Lake City]] from [[Los Angeles]] pioneered a wagon route through the County that became the [[Mormon Road]]. In 1849, this road became known as the &quot;Southern Route&quot;, the winter route of the [[California Trail]] from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles during the [[California Gold Rush]]. By the mid 1850s, the route now known as the Salt Lake Road in California, and the California Road in [[Utah Territory]], was a wagon trade route between the two. In the mid 1850s, Mormons established a settlement at [[Las Vegas]]. In the 1860s, Mormon colonies were established along the Virgin and [[Muddy River (Nevada)|Muddy River]]s.

All of the county was part of [[Mohave County, Arizona|Mohave County]], [[Arizona Territory]], when that Territory was formed in 1863, before Nevada became a state. In 1865, it became part of [[Pah-Ute County, Arizona Territory]]. The part of Pah-Ute County north and west of the Colorado River was assigned to the new State of Nevada in 1866, however Arizona territory fought the division until 1871. Pah-Ute County became part of Lincoln County and the westernmost part, the southernmost part of [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]].

Clark County was named for [[William A. Clark]], a [[Montana]] copper magnate and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pitts|first1=Stanley Thomas|title=An Unjust Legacy: A Critical Study of the Political Campaigns of William Andrews Clark, 1888-1901|date=May 2006|publisher=M.S. thesis|location=University of North Texas|pages=205|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc5251/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark was largely responsible for construction of the [[Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad]] through the area, contributing to the region's early development. Clark County is a major tourist destination, with 150,000 hotel rooms. The [[Las Vegas Strip]], home to most of the hotel-casinos known to many around the world, is not within the City of Las Vegas city limits, but in unincorporated Paradise. It is, however, in the [[Las Vegas Valley]].

Clark County is coextensive with the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Statistical Area|Las Vegas MSA]], a [[metropolitan statistical area]] designated by the [[Office of Management and Budget]] and used by the [[United States Census Bureau]] and other agencies for statistical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro_general/List4.txt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209034353/http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro_general/List4.txt|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 9, 2006|title= Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Components, December 2005, with codes|accessdate=March 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Kyle Canyon Big Falls 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Kyle Canyon in the [[Mount Charleston Wilderness]] ]]
The [[Colorado River (US)|Colorado River]] forms the county's southeastern boundary, with [[Hoover Dam]] forming [[Lake Mead]] along much of its length. The [[List of U.S. states by elevation|lowest point]] in the state of Nevada is on the Colorado River just south of [[Laughlin, Nevada|Laughlin]] in Clark County, where it flows out of Nevada into [[California]]  and [[Arizona]]. Greater Las Vegas is a tectonic valley, surrounded by four mountain ranges, with nearby [[Mount Charleston]] being the highest elevation at {{convert|11918|ft|abbr=on}}, located to the northwest. Other than the forests on Mount Charleston, the geography in Clark County is a desert. Creosote bushes are the main native vegetation, and the mountains are mostly rocky with little vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Clark+County,+NV/@35.9247456,-116.0937367,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80b8d6496837aa1d:0x3317d403aa5236f8!8m2!3d36.0795613!4d-115.094045 ''Clark County NV''  Google Maps (accessed 10 February 2019)]&lt;/ref&gt; The terrain slopes to the south and east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.daftlogic.com/sandbox-google-maps-find-altitude.htm |title=&quot;Find an Altitude&quot;  Google Maps (accessed 10 February 2019) |access-date=February 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521043409/https://www.daftlogic.com/sandbox-google-maps-find-altitude.htm |archive-date=May 21, 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The county has an area of {{convert|8061|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|7891|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|169|sqmi}} (2.1%) is water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_32.txt|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=December 20, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental factors===
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2009}}
Clark County has a [[biodiversity|diverse]] [[desert]] [[flora]] and [[fauna]], including higher elevation mountain areas, the desert floor and the [[Colorado River]]/[[Lake Mead]] ecosystems. Variations in diurnal temperature as well as seasonal swings in temperature create demanding adaptation elements on the [[species]] of this county. [[Human overpopulation|Population expansion]], especially since 1970, has placed additional pressure on species in the area.

Correspondingly [[air quality]] levels prior to the 1960s were in a favorable range, but the proliferation of automobiles with the human population expansion created circumstances where some Federal Air Quality Standards began to be violated in the 1980s.

To plan for the wave of development forecast by 1980, Clark County embarked on a regional Environmental Impact Assessment funded by a Federal Section 208 program, with [[Sedway Cooke]] conducting the planning work and Earth Metrics performing environmental analysis. This endeavor projected population growth, land use changes and environmental impacts.

To prevent the loss of federal funds due to unacceptable dust levels in the Las Vegas valley, in 2003 the Nevada Air Quality Management division (under direction of Clark County officials) created the massive [[Dusty the Dusthole|&quot;Don't Be a Dusthole&quot;]] campaign. The campaign successfully raised awareness of dust pollution in the Las Vegas valley, quantifiably reducing pollutants and preserving ongoing federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Jan-04-Thu-2007/news/11774909.html|title=News – Dusty the Dusthole successful|publisher=Reviewjournal.com|accessdate=May 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324101925/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Jan-04-Thu-2007/news/11774909.html|archive-date=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apex Landfill]], at {{convert|2200|acre|abbr=on}} is the nation's largest landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Schoenmann|author-link=Joe Schoenmann|title=Official calls for sort reform|url=http://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/dec/17/official-calls-sort-reform/|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=December 17, 2008|accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republic Services]] owns and operates the landfill.

===Earthquake hazards===
Nevada is the third most seismically active state in the U.S. (after Alaska and California); the United States Geological Survey has estimated that over the next 50 years, Clark County has a 10–20% chance of a M6.0 or greater earthquake occurring within {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} of Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.nbmg.unr.edu/Public/freedownloads/misc/Presentations/earthquakes/lossestimationmodeling23feb06.pdf|title=Loss-Estimation Modeling of Earthquake Scenarios for Each County in Nevada Using HAZUS-MH|date=February 23, 2006|website=Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology|publisher=Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology/University of Nevada, Reno|access-date=March 27, 2016|quote=&quot;Probability of an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or greater occurring within 50 km in 50 years (from USGS probabilistic seismic hazard analysis) 10–20% chance for Las Vegas area, magnitude 6&quot; (p. 65)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clarkcountygovernmentcenter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Clark County Government Center]] in Las Vegas with the [[World Market Center]] temporary buildings in background]]
The [[Clark County Commission]] consists of seven members who are elected to serve staggered four-year terms in biennial [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] elections. The commission members elect a chairman, who chairs their meetings. A hired county manager handles day-to-day operations under direction of the commission. The county's [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] towns also have appointed boards that provide advice to the commission.

The county operates out of the [[Clark County Government Center]] in the City of Las Vegas. The building is unusual in shape, and includes an outdoor [[amphitheater]] for concerts and other events.

The [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]] provides most law enforcement services in the county, including operation of the county's central jail, the [[Clark County Detention Center]] (CCDC). The present department was created in 1973 when the Clark County Sheriff's Department merged with the Las Vegas Police Department.

Other entities with police forces include [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], the [[Clark County School District Police Department|Clark County School District]], and cities such as [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]], [[Mesquite, Nevada|Mesquite]], [[Boulder City, Nevada|Boulder City]] and [[North Las Vegas, Nevada|North Las Vegas]]. The Clark County Park Police is responsible for all of the parks operated by the county and some selected special venues, such as the Clark County Amphitheater, Clark County Archery Range, and the Desert Rose Golf Course.

The Regional Justice Center replaced the Clark County Courthouse in 2005, and is about 3 blocks from downtown Fremont Street, at 200 Lewis Avenue.

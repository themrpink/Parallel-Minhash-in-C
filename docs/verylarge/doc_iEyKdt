On 9–10 September 1943, the German [[Wehrmacht]] occupied northern and central Italy. Hitler appointed Mussolini head of a fascist puppet state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] or Salò Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Sarfatti (2006), 180&lt;/ref&gt; Pound called it the &quot;Republic of Utopia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2013), 144&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officers began concentrating Jews in transit camps before deporting them to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarfatti (2006), 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In October and November 1943 the Germans began concentrating Jews in transit camps in major cities, including Florence, Genoa, Milan, Rome, and Trieste. According to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], &quot;these operations had limited success, due in part to advance warning given to the Jews by Italian authorities and the Vatican, and in part to the unwillingness of many non-Jewish Italians, including Salò police authorities, to participate in or facilitate the roundups.&amp;nbsp;... In all, the Germans deported 8,564 Jews from Italy, Italian-occupied France, and the islands of Rhodes and Kos, most of them to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. 1,009 returned. In addition, the Germans shot 196 Jews in Italy proper, nearly half of these at the [[Ardeatine massacre|Ardeatine Caves]] in March 1944. Another approximately 100 died in the police transit camps or in prisons or police custody through Italy. More than 40,000 Jews survived [[the Holocaust in Italy]].&quot;&lt;ref name=USHMM&gt;[https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/italy &quot;Italy&quot;]. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Of the first group of 1,034 Jews to arrive in Auschwitz from Rome on 23 October 1943, 839 were gassed.&lt;ref&gt;Kubica (1988), 416; Czech (2000), 187–188&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome when the German occupation began, Pound headed north to [[Gais, South Tyrol|Gais]], on foot and by train, to visit his daughter, a journey of about {{convert|450|mile}}.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 627&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to his daughter, it was during this visit that Pound first told her he had a wife in Rapallo and a son in England.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 272–273; Carpenter (1988), 628–629; Moody (2015), 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;}} On or around 23 November 1943, he met [[Fernando Mezzasoma]], the new Minister of Popular Culture, in [[Salò]]. Pound wrote to Dorothy from Salò asking if she could obtain a radio confiscated from the Jews to give to Rudge, so that Rudge could help with his work.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2015), 72&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1 December 1943 Pound began writing scripts for the state's new radio station.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 632–633; Tytell (1987), 274&lt;/ref&gt; The following day he suggested to [[Alessandro Pavolini]], secretary of the [[Republican Fascist Party]], that book stores be legally obliged to showcase certain books, including ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (1903), a hoax document purporting to be a Jewish plan to dominate the world. &quot;The arrest of Jews will create a wave of useless mercy,&quot; Pound wrote, &quot;thus the need to disseminate the Protocols. The intellectuals are capable of a passion more durable than emotional, but they need to understand the reasons for a conflict.&quot;&lt;ref name=Feldman2013p159&gt;Feldman (2013), 159; Moody (2015), 74&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 January 1945, in a script called &quot;Corpses of Course&quot; for the program ''Jerry's Front Calling'', Pound wrote: &quot;Why shouldn't there be one grand beano; wiping out Sieff and Kuhn and Loeb and Guggenheim and Stinkenfinger and the rest of the nazal bleaters?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2013), 159&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1944 the German military, trying to secure the coast against the Allies, forced the Pounds to evacuate their seafront apartment in Rapallo. From then until the end of the war, the couple lived with Rudge in her home above Rapallo at Sant' Ambrogio.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2015), 85&lt;/ref&gt; There were food shortages, no coffee, and no newspapers, telephones, or letters.&lt;ref name=Tytell1987p272&gt;Tytell (1987), 272&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rudge, Ezra and Dorothy would spend their nights listening to the [[BBC World Service|BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;Conover (2001), 154;  Moody (2015), 86&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the radio scripts, Pound was writing for the newspaper ''Il Popolo di Alessandria''. He wanted to write for the more reputable ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' in Milan, but the editor regarded his Italian as &quot;incomprehensible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2015), 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini and his mistress, [[Clara Petacci]], were shot by Italian [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] on 28 April 1945. Their bodies were displayed in the [[Piazzale Loreto]] in Milan, abused by the crowd, then left hanging upside down.&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth (2003), ix&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Thus Ben and la Clara ''a Milano'' / by the heels at Milano&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Canto LXXIV&quot;, Pound (2003b), 3, lines 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May armed partisans arrived at Rudge's home to find Pound alone. He picked up the Confucian text ''[[Four Books and Five Classics|Four Books]]'' and a Chinese–English dictionary and was taken to their headquarters in [[Zoagli]],&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth (2003), ix; Moody (2015), 100&lt;/ref&gt; then at his request to the U.S. [[Counterintelligence Corps (United States Army)|Counter Intelligence Corps]] headquarters in [[Genoa]], where he was interrogated by FBI agent Frank L. Amprin.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 276; Sieburth (2003), x&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound asked to send a cable to [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] to help negotiate a &quot;just peace&quot; with Japan. He wanted to make a final broadcast called &quot;Ashes of Europe Calling&quot;, in which he would recommend not only peace with Japan, but American management of Italy, the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, and leniency toward Germany. His requests were denied and the script was forwarded to [[J. Edgar Hoover]].&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth (2003), x&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later Amprin removed over 7,000 letters, articles and other documents from Rudge's home as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 276; Sieburth (2003), xii&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 May, the day [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany surrendered]], Pound gave the Americans a further statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not anti-Semitic, and I distinguish between the Jewish usurer and the Jew who does an honest day's work for a living.{{pb}} Hitler and Mussolini were simple men from the country. I think that Hitler was a Saint, and wanted nothing for himself. I think that he was fooled into anti-Semitism and it ruined him. That was his mistake. When you see the &quot;mess&quot; that Italy gets into by bumping off Mussolini, you will see why someone could believe in some of his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2013), 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later that day he told an American reporter, Edd Johnson, that Hitler was &quot;a Jeanne d'Arc&amp;nbsp;... Like many martyrs, he held extreme views&quot;. Mussolini was &quot;a very human, imperfect character who lost his head&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1945); Sieburth (2003), xi; Moody (2007), 113–114&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May he was transferred to the United States Army Disciplinary Training Center north of Pisa, where he was placed in one of the camp's {{convert|6|by|6|ft|m|adj=on}} outdoor steel cages, with tar paper covers, lit up at night by floodlights. Engineers reinforced his cage the night before he arrived in case fascist sympathizers tried to break him out.&lt;ref name=Tytell1987p277&gt;Tytell (1987), 277&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound lived in isolation in the heat, sleeping on the concrete, denied exercise and communication, apart from daily access to the chaplain.&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth (2003), xiii&lt;/ref&gt; After three weeks, he stopped eating.&lt;ref name=Tytell1987p277/&gt; He recorded what seemed to be a breakdown in &quot;Canto LXXX&quot;, where [[Odysseus]] is saved from drowning by [[Leucothea]]: &quot;hast'ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness, / when the raft broke and the waters went over me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pound (1996), 533; Sieburth (2003), xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week. On 14 and 15 June he was examined by psychiatrists, after which he was transferred to his own tent.&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth (2003), xiv&lt;/ref&gt; He began to write, drafting what became known as ''[[The Pisan Cantos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth (2003), xv&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of two sheets of toilet paper showing the first ten lines of &quot;Canto LXXIV&quot; in pencil suggests he started it while in the cage.&lt;ref&gt;Kimpel and Eaves (1981), 474; Sieburth (2003), frontispiece; Moody (2015), 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound arrived back in Washington, D.C. on 18 November 1945, two days before the start of the [[Nuremberg trials]].&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 284&lt;/ref&gt; Lt. Col. P. V.

They found him &quot;abnormally [[Grandiosity|grandiose]]&amp;nbsp;... expansive and exuberant in manner, exhibiting [[pressure of speech]], [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|discursiveness]] and [[Distraction|distractibility]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2015), 177–178&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth psychiatrist appointed by Pound's lawyer initially thought he was a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]], which would have made him fit to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;Torrey (1992), 193 and 317, n.&amp;nbsp;54, citing &quot;FBI interview with Dr. Wendell Muncie, February 20, 1956, in the FBI file on Pound&quot;; Moody (2015), 179&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 1945, as case no. 58,102, he was transferred to Howard Hall, St. Elizabeths' maximum security ward, where he was held in a single cell with peepholes.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2015), 192&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors were admitted to the waiting room for 15 minutes at a time, while patients wandered around screaming.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 294; Moody (2015), 194&lt;/ref&gt; A hearing on 13 February 1946 concluded that he was of &quot;unsound mind&quot;; he shouted in court: &quot;I never did believe in Fascism, God damn it; I am opposed to Fascism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2015), 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Pound's lawyer, [[Julien Cornell]], requested his release at a hearing in January 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/07/obituaries/julien-cornell-83-the-defense-lawyer-in-ezra-pound-case.html &quot;Julien Cornell, 83, The Defense Lawyer In Ezra Pound Case&quot;].

[[James Laughlin]] of [[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]] had Cantos LXXIV–LXXXIV, known as ''The Pisan Cantos'', ready for publication in 1946 and gave Pound an advance copy,&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 293&lt;/ref&gt; but Laughlin held back, waiting for the right time to publish. A group of Pound's friends—T.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Eliot, E.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Cummings, [[W. H. Auden]], Allen Tate, and [[Joseph Cornell]]—met Laughlin in June 1948 to discuss how to get Pound released. They planned to have him awarded the first [[Bollingen Prize]], a new national poetry award with $1,000 prize money donated by the [[Mellon family]].&lt;ref name=Tytell302&gt;Tytell (1987), 302&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards committee consisted of 15 fellows of the [[Library of Congress]], including several of Pound's supporters, such as Eliot, Tate, Conrad Aiken, [[Katherine Anne Porter]], and [[Theodore Spencer]].{{efn|The Associated Press reported the list of judges as [[Conrad Aiken]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Louise Bogan]], [[Katherine Garrison Chapin]], [[T. S.

Also on the list were [[Leonie Adams]], the Library of Congress's poetry consultant, and [[Theodore Spencer]], who died on 18 January 1949, just before the award was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/02/20/84196391.pdf &quot;Pound, in Mental Clinic, Wins Prize for Poetry Penned in Treason Cell&quot;].

There was uproar.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 792&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' quoted critics who said that poetry cannot &quot;convert words into maggots that eat at human dignity and still be good poetry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Canto Controversy&quot;.

===Diagnosis===
During a case conference at St. Elizabeths on 28 January 1946, six psychiatrists had concluded that Pound suffered from [[psychopathic personality disorder]] but was not [[Psychosis|psychotic]]. Present during the meeting, he decided to lie on the floor while the psychiatrists interviewed him.&lt;ref&gt;Torrey (1992), 202–204&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 the American Psychiatric Association published its first ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-1), and St. Elizabeths began diagnosing patients according to its definitions. In July 1953 a psychiatrist added to Pound's notes that he probably suffered from [[narcissistic personality disorder]]. The main feature of Pound's personality, he wrote, was his &quot;profound, incredible, over-weaning narcissism&quot;. A [[personality disorder]], unlike conditions that give rise to psychosis, is not regarded as a [[mental illness]], and the diagnosis would have made Pound fit to stand trial. On 31 May 1955, at the request of the hospital's superintendent Winfred Overholser, the diagnosis was changed to &quot;psychotic disorder, undifferentiated&quot;, which is classified as mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Torrey (1992), 248–249&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, after his release from St. Elizabeths, Pound was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name=Rossi2008pp145-146/&gt;

===Mullins and Kasper===
While in St. Elizabeths, Pound would often decline to talk to psychiatrists with names he deemed Jewish (he called psychiatrists &quot;kikiatrists&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Cohassey (2014), 142&lt;/ref&gt; and he apparently told [[Charles Olson]]: &quot;I was a Zionist in Italy, but now I'm for pogroms, after what I've experienced in here (SLiz).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Olson (1991), 93&lt;/ref&gt; He advised visitors to read the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', and he referred to any visitor he happened not to like as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 303–304&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1953 he wrote to [[Olivia Rossetti Agresti]] that Hitler was &quot;bit by dirty Jew mania for World Domination, as yu used to point out/ this WORST of German diseases was got from yr/ idiolized and filthy biblical bastards. Adolf clear on the baccilus of kikism/ that is on nearly all the other poisons.[sic] but failed to get a vaccine against that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tryphonopoulous and Surette (1998), 131–132; Kimpel and Eaves (1983), 50&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pound struck up a friendship with [[Eustace Mullins]], apparently associated with the Aryan League of America and author of the 1961 biography ''This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound''.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 304; Wilhelm (1994), 286, 306&lt;/ref&gt; Even more damaging was his friendship with [[John Kasper]], a [[Ku Klux Klan]] member who, after ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (a 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision mandating racial desegregation in public schools), set up a [[Citizens' Council]] chapter, the Seaboard White Citizens' Council in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 306; Barnhisel (1998), 283; Marsh (2015), 93&lt;/ref&gt; Members had to be white, supportive of racial segregation, and believers in the divinity of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh (2015), 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; Kasper wrote to Pound after admiring him at university, and the two became friends.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 306&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 Kasper opened a far-right bookstore, &quot;Make it New&quot;, at 169 [[Bleecker Street]], [[Greenwich Village]],&lt;ref&gt;Swift (2017), 198&lt;/ref&gt; that displayed Pound's work in the window.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 307; Hickman (2005), 127&lt;/ref&gt; With Pound's cooperation, he and another Pound admirer, T. David Horton, set up Square Dollar Series, a publishing imprint that reprinted Pound's books and others he approved of.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 307; Barnhisel (1998), 276ff; Moody (2015), 295&lt;/ref&gt;

It became increasingly clear that Pound was schooling Kasper in the latter's pro-segregation activism.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 308&lt;/ref&gt; In January and February 1957 the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' ran a series of articles on their relationship, after which the FBI began photographing Pound's visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Barnhisel (1998), 287–288; Moody (2017), 378&lt;/ref&gt; One article alleged that some of Kasper's pamphlets had, as [[John Tytell]] put it, &quot;a distinctly Poundian ring&quot; to them.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 306; {{cite news |last1=Bird |first1=Robert S. |title=Pound's Ideology Permeates Kasper Speeches, Writing |work=The Nashville Banner |agency=New York Herald Tribune News Service |date=31 January 1957 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For example, one flier was modeled on the 1914 ''[[Blast (magazine)|Blast]]'' manifesto: &quot;JAIL [[NAACP]], alien, unclean, unchristian / BLAST irrelevant ungodly LEADERS&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 306&lt;/ref&gt;}} Kasper was jailed in 1956 over a speech he made in Clinton, Tennessee,&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 308; [https://www.nytimes.com/1957/06/02/archives/jail-term-upheld-for-bias-leader-kasper-foe-of-integration-loses.html &quot;Jail term upheld for bias leader&quot;].

Between late 1955 and early 1957,&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 442–443&lt;/ref&gt; Pound wrote at least 80 unsigned or pseudonymous articles—&quot;often ugly&quot;, Swift notes—for the ''New Times'' of Melbourne, a newspaper connected to the [[Douglas Credit Party|social-credit]] movement. Noel Stock, one of Pound's correspondents and early biographers, worked for the paper and published Pound's articles there.&lt;ref&gt;Swift (2017), 27, 199; Stock (1970), xiii, 443&lt;/ref&gt; A 24-year-old radio reporter at the time, Stock first wrote to Pound in hospital after reading ''The Pisan Cantos''.&lt;ref name=Carpenter1988p815&gt;Carpenter (1988), 815&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the ''New Times'' in April 1956, Pound wrote: &quot;Our Victorian forebears would have been greatly scandalized at the idea that one might not be free to study inherited racial characteristics,&quot; and &quot;Some races are retentive, mainly of the least desirable bits of their barbaric past.&quot; There was a &quot;Jewish-Communist plot&quot;, which he compared to syphilis. Equality was dismissed as &quot;anti-biological nonsense&quot;.&lt;ref name=Swift2017p200/&gt; &quot;There were no gas ovens in Italy&quot;, he wrote in April 1956; a month later he referred to the &quot;fuss about Hitler&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Swift (2017), 218&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August 1956: &quot;It is perfectly well known that the fuss about 'de-segregation' in the United States has been started by Jews.&quot; Instead, America needed &quot;race pride&quot;.&lt;ref name=Swift2017p200&gt;Swift (2017), 200&lt;/ref&gt; Using pseudonyms, he sent his articles directly to Stock, so that the newspaper's editor may not have realized they had all been written by Pound. Stock sent Pound copies of the published articles, which he would distribute to his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 443&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed similar material to other publications, including ''Edge'',&lt;ref&gt;Swift (2017), 199&lt;/ref&gt; which Stock founded in October 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), xiii, 443&lt;/ref&gt; Stock called ''Edge'' the magazine of the &quot;international Poundian underground&quot;.&lt;ref name=Carpenter1988p815/&gt;

===Release===
[[File:Ernest-Hemingway-1954-in-Cuba.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Ernest Hemingway]], 1954]]

Pound's friends continued to try to get him out of St. Elizabeths. In 1948, in an effort to present his radio broadcasts as harmless, Olga Rudge self-published six of them (on cultural topics only) as ''[[If This Be Treason]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 786; Gill (2005), 155&lt;/ref&gt; She visited him twice, in 1952 and 1955, but could not convince him to be more assertive about his release.&lt;ref name=Tytell1987p305&gt;Tytell (1987), 305&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 she had written to Hemingway to complain that Pound's friends had not done enough. Hemingway and Rudge did not like each other.&lt;ref name=Cohassey2014p147&gt;Cohassey (2014), 147&lt;/ref&gt; He told Dorothy in 1951 that &quot;the person who makes least sense&amp;nbsp;...in all this is Olga Rudge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2003), 742&lt;/ref&gt; In what John Cohassey called a &quot;controlled, teeth-gritting response&quot;, Hemingway replied to Rudge that he would pardon Pound if he could, but that Pound had &quot;made the rather serious mistake of being a traitor to his country, and temporarily he must lie in the bed he made&quot;. He ended by saying &quot;To be even more blunt, I have always loved Dorothy, and still do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cohassey (2014), 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, shortly after he won the [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1954, Hemingway told ''Time'' magazine: &quot;I believe this would be a good year to release poets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Books: An American Storyteller&quot;. ''Time'' magazine, 13 December 1954, [http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,935439-6,00.html 6/11]&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Archibald MacLeish]] asked him in June 1957 to write a letter on Pound's behalf. Hemingway believed Pound would not stop making inappropriate statements and friendships, but he signed MacLeish's letter anyway and pledged $1,500 to be handed to Pound upon his release.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2000), 305&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for the ''Paris Review'' in early 1958, Hemingway said that Pound should be released and Kasper jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Plimpton (1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several publications began campaigning in 1957. ''Le Figaro'' published an appeal titled &quot;The Lunatic at St Elizabeths&quot;. ''The New Republic'', ''Esquire'', and ''The Nation'' followed suit. ''The Nation'' argued that Pound was a &quot;sick and vicious old man&quot;, but that he had rights.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 322&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 MacLeish hired [[Thurman Arnold]], a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee, to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment. Overholser, the hospital's superintendent, supported the application with an affidavit stating Pound was permanently and incurably insane, and that confinement served no therapeutic purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 325; Lewis (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was heard on 18 April 1958 by Chief Judge [[Bolitha Laws]], who had committed Pound to St. Elizabeths in 1945. The Justice Department did not oppose the motion,&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 325–326&lt;/ref&gt; and Pound was discharged on 7 May.&lt;ref name=Swift2017p27&gt;Swift (2017), 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound and Dorothy arrived in Naples on the ''Christoforo Columbo'' on 9 July 1958, where Pound was photographed giving a [[Roman salute#Italy|fascist salute]] to the waiting press.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 848&lt;/ref&gt; When asked when he had been released from the mental hospital, he replied: &quot;I never was.

''The New York Times'', 10 July 1958&lt;/ref&gt; They were accompanied by a young teacher Pound had met in hospital, Marcella Spann, ostensibly acting as his secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 305, 327–328&lt;; Carpenter (1988), 848&lt;/ref&gt; Disembarking at Genoa, the group arrived three days later at [[Schloss Brunnenburg]], near [[Merano]] in [[South Tyrol]], to live with Mary,&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 848; Moody (2015), xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt; where Pound met his grandchildren for the first time.&lt;ref name=Tytell328&gt;Tytell (1987), 328&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The women soon fell out; &quot;Canto CXIII&quot; may have alluded to it: &quot;Pride, jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pound (1996), 807; Tytell (1987), 331&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to the United States in October 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 332; Stoicheff (1995), 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--say more about Spann--&gt;

By December 1959 Pound was mired in depression.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 347&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writer Michael Reck, who visited him several times at St. Elizabeths,&lt;ref name=Reck1986&gt;Reck (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Pound was a changed man; he said little and called his work &quot;worthless&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reck (1968), 27&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1960 interview in Rome with [[Donald Hall]] for ''Paris Review'', he said: &quot;You—find me—in fragments.&quot; He paced up and down during the three days it took to complete the interview, never finishing a sentence, bursting with energy one minute, then sagging, and at one point seemed about to collapse. Hall said it was clear that he &quot;doubted the value of everything he had done in his life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/dGcB8 Hall (1962)]; Tytell (1987), 333&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tirol Brunnenburg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|In 1958 Ezra and Dorothy lived with Mary at [[Schloss Brunnenburg]].]]

Those close to him thought he was suffering from dementia, and in mid-1960 he spent time in a clinic when his weight dropped. He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary tract infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga Rudge, first in Rapallo then in Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar.&lt;ref name=Tytell1987p334&gt;Tytell (1987), 334–335&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 Pound attended a meeting in Rome in honor of [[Oswald Mosley]], who was visiting Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Redman (2001), 260&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to [[John Tytell]] and [[Humphrey Carpenter]], he was photographed on [[May Day]] at the head of a [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] [[Italian Social Movement|Movimento Sociale Italiano]] parade of 500 men.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 334–335; Carpenter (1988), 873–874&lt;/ref&gt; This did not happen, according to [[Tim Redman]] and A. David Moody, and no such photograph has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2015), 424&lt;/ref&gt;}} His health continued to decline, and his friends were dying: Wyndham Lewis in 1957, Ernest Hemingway in 1961 (Hemingway shot himself), E. E. Cummings in 1962, William Carlos Williams in 1963, T. S. Eliot in 1965.&lt;ref name=Tytell1987p335&gt;Tytell (1987), 335&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi: &quot;I spoil everything I touch.&amp;nbsp;... All my life I believed I knew nothing, yes, knew nothing. And so words became devoid of meaning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 335&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Eliot's funeral in London and visited [[W. B. Yeats]]' widow in Dublin (Yeats died in 1939). 

In 1966 he was admitted to the [[University of Genoa|Genoa School of Medicine]]'s psychiatric hospital for an evaluation after prostate surgery. His notes said he had [[psychomotor retardation]], insomnia, depression, and he believed he had been &quot;contaminated by microbes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi (2008), 144&lt;/ref&gt; According to a psychiatrist who treated him, Pound had previously been treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. This time he was given [[imipramine]] and responded well. The doctors diagnosed [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name=Rossi2008pp145-146&gt;Rossi (2008), 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he attended the opening of an exhibition in New York featuring his blue-inked version of Eliot's ''The Waste Land''.&lt;ref name=Nadel2007p18&gt;Nadel (2007), 18&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to Hamilton College and received a standing ovation.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 337&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting Ginsberg, Reck, and Russell===
[[File:Allen Ginsberg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=photograph|[[Allen Ginsberg]], 1978]]
In the restaurant of the Pensione Cici in Venice in 1967,&lt;ref name=Reck1986/&gt; Pound told [[Allen Ginsberg]], Michael Reck, and [[Peter Russell (poet)|Peter Russell]] that his poems were &quot;a lot of double talk&quot; and made no sense, and that his writing was &quot;a mess&quot;, &quot;stupid and ignorant all the way through&quot;. Reck wrote about the meeting in ''[[Evergreen Review]]'' the following year. &quot;At seventy I realized that instead of being a lunatic, I was a moron,&quot; Pound reportedly said. He &quot;looked very morose&quot; and barely spoke: &quot;There is nothing harder than conversing with Pound nowadays,&quot; Reck wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Reck (1968), 28–29, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound offered a carefully worded rejection of his antisemitism, according to Reck. When Ginsberg reassured Pound that he had &quot;shown us the way&quot;, he is said to have replied: &quot;Any good I've done has been spoiled by bad intentions—the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things.&quot; Reck continued: &quot;Then very slowly, with emphasis, surely conscious of Ginsberg's being Jewish: 'But the worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-Semitism.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reck (1968), 29; Carpenter (1988), 898–899&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In 1988 [[Christopher Ricks]] took issue with Pound's use of the word ''mistake'', which he wrote was &quot;scarcely commensurate with the political and spiritual monstrosity&quot; of Pound's antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Ricks (1988), 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Julius]] argued in 1995 that Pound's use of the term ''suburban'' was the result of &quot;an arrogance that broods on the descent from an ideal of greatness rather than on the injury which that descent did to others&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Julius (1995), 185.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Death===
[[File:Gravesite of Ezra Pound &amp; Olga Rudge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=photograph|left|The graves of Pound and Olga Rudge on the [[Isola di San Michele]]]]

Shortly before his death in 1972, an [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] committee, which included his publisher James Laughlin, proposed that Pound be awarded the [[Emerson-Thoreau Medal]]. After a storm of protest, the academy's council opposed it by 13 to 9.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 337–338; Carpenter (1988), 908&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreword of a Faber &amp; Faber volume of his prose, he wrote in July: &quot;In sentences referring to groups or races 'they' should be used with great care. re USURY: / I was out of focus, taking a symptom for a cause. / The cause is AVARICE.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 909&lt;/ref&gt;

On his 87th birthday, on 30 October 1972, he was too weak to leave his bedroom. The next night he was admitted to the San Giovanni e Paolo Civil Hospital in Venice, where he died in his sleep on 1 November of &quot;sudden [[intestinal blockage|blockage of the intestine]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 910&lt;/ref&gt; Alerted by telegram, Dorothy Pound, who was living in a care home near Cambridge, England, requested a Protestant funeral in Venice. Telegrams were sent via American embassies in Rome and London, and the consulate in Milan, but Rudge would not change the plans she had already made for the morning of 3 November. Omar Pound flew to Venice as soon as he could, with Peter du Sautoy of Faber &amp; Faber, but he arrived too late.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2015), 487–488; Swift (2017), 244&lt;/ref&gt; Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed Pound's body to Venice's municipal cemetery, [[Isola di San Michele]], where after a Protestant service he was buried, near [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], with other non-Italian Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 339; Carpenter (1988), 911; Cohassey (2014), 162; [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/11/02/79477128.pdf &quot;Ezra Pound Dies in Venice at Age of 87&quot;]. ''The New York Times'', 2 November 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hugh Kenner]], Pound had wanted to be buried in Idaho with his bust by [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] on his grave.&lt;ref&gt;Kenner (1973), 259; Carpenter (1988), 911&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Pound died in England the following year, aged 87.

After the Bollingen Prize in 1949, Pound's friends made every effort to rehabiliate him.&lt;ref&gt;Barnhisel (1998), 273–274; Erkkila (2011), xlvii&lt;/ref&gt; James Laughlin's [[New Directions Publishing]] published his ''Selected Poems'', with an introduction by Eliot, and a censored selection of ''The Cantos''. [[Ralph Fletcher Seymour]] published ''Patria Mia'' (written around 1912) to show that Pound was an American patriot.&lt;ref name=Erkila2011pxlvii/&gt; In advertisements, magazine articles, and critical introductions, Pound's friends and publishers attributed his antisemitism and fascism to mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Barnhisel (1998), 273–274&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary scholar Betsy Erkkila writes that no one was more important to Pound's rehabilitation than [[Hugh Kenner]],&lt;ref name=Erkkila2001pxlviii&gt;Erkkila (2011), xlviii&lt;/ref&gt; who was introduced to Pound by [[Marshall McLuhan]] in St. Elizabeths in May 1948, when Kenner was 25.&lt;ref&gt;Tremblay (1998), 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; Kenner's ''The Poetry of Ezra Pound'' (1951) adopted a [[New Criticism|New Critical]] approach, where all that mattered was the work itself.&lt;ref&gt;Erkkila (2011), xliii&lt;/ref&gt;

New Directions and [[Faber &amp; Faber]] published ''Ezra Pound: Translations'' in 1953, introduced by Kenner, and the following year ''Literary Essays of Ezra Pound'', introduced by Eliot.&lt;ref name=Erkila2011pxlvii&gt;Erkkila (2011), xlvii&lt;/ref&gt; The first PhD dissertation on Pound was completed in 1948, and by 1970 there were around ten a year.

He included in this approach Caroll F. Terrell's ''Paideuma: A Journal Devoted to Ezra Pound Scholarship'',&lt;ref name=Surette2005&gt;Surette and Tryphonopoulos (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1972 and edited by Kenner and [[Eva Hesse]],&lt;ref name=Erkkila2001pxlviii/&gt;{{efn|From 2001 ''Paideuma'' began publishing material about modernist poetry in general, not only Pound.&lt;ref&gt;Erkkila (2011), lvi–lvii&lt;/ref&gt;}} and Terrell's two-volume ''A Companion to the Cantos of Ezra Pound'' (1980–1984).&lt;ref name=Surette2005/&gt; In 1971 Terrell founded the [[National Poetry Foundation]] to focus on Pound, and organized conferences on Pound in 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1990.&lt;ref name=Terrellobit&gt;[https://obituaries.bowdoin.edu/carroll-franklin-terrell-38/ &quot;Carroll Franklin Terrell '38&quot;].

Following [[Eustace Mullins]]' biography, ''This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound'' (1961), was ''Life of Ezra Pound'' (1970) by Noel Stock. A former reporter, Stock was one of the publishers of Pound's newspaper articles in the 1950s, including his antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (2010), 162; Swift (2017), 199&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Bush's ''The Genesis of Ezra Pound's Cantos'' (1976) became the first critical study of ''The Cantos''.&lt;ref name=Nadel2001p12&gt;Nadel (2001), 12&lt;/ref&gt; Several significant biographies appeared in the 1980s: J.

A. David Moody's three-volume ''Ezra Pound: Poet'' (2007–2015) combines biography with literary criticism.&lt;ref name=Nadel2010bp162&gt;Nadel (2010), 162–165&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies that examine Pound's relationships with the [[Far-right politics|far right]] include Robert Casillo's ''The Genealogy of Demons'' (1988); [[Tim Redman]]'s ''Ezra Pound and Italian Fascism'' (1999); Leon Surette's ''Pound in Purgatory'' (1999);&lt;ref&gt;Coats (2009), 81&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Feldman (historian)|Matthew Feldman]]'s ''Ezra Pound's Fascist Propaganda, 1935–45'' (2013); and Alec Marsh's ''John Kasper and Ezra Pound'' (2015).

Much of Pound's legacy lies in his advancement of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century, particularly between 1910 and 1925.&lt;ref name=Menand2008&gt;[https://archive.is/Wf7h0 Menand (2008)]; [https://archive.is/wdhEk Montgomery (1972)]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Eliot, Joyce, Lewis, Frost, Williams, Hemingway, H.D., Aldington, and Aiken, he befriended and helped Cummings, Bunting, Ford, [[Marianne Moore]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Margaret C.

[[File:Hieratic Head of Ezra Pound 01 (brightened).jpg|thumb|Ezra Pound in marble by [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] (1914)]]
Beyond this, his legacy is mixed. He was a strong lyricist with an &quot;ear&quot; for words;&lt;ref&gt;Ingham (2001), 236–237&lt;/ref&gt; his ''Times'' obituary said he had a &quot;faultless sense of [[cadence]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=LondonTimesobit/&gt; According to [[Ira Nadel]], he &quot;overturned poetic meter, literary style, and the state of the long poem&quot;. Nadel cited the importance of Pound's editing of ''The Waste Land'', the publication of ''Ulysses'', and his role in developing of Imagism.&lt;ref name=Nadel2005pix&gt;Nadel (2005), ix&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Witemeyer argued that Imagism was &quot;probably the most important single movement&quot; in 20th-century English-language poetry, because it affected all the leading poets of Pound's generation and the two generations after him.&lt;ref&gt;Witemeyer (2001), 48&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hugh Kenner]] in 1951, although no great contemporary writer was less read than Pound, there was no one who could &quot;over and over again appeal more surely, through sheer beauty of language&quot; to people who would otherwise rather talk about poets than read them.&lt;ref&gt;Kenner (1951), 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Against this, [[Robert Conquest]] argued in 1979 that critics were responsible for having promoted Pound despite his &quot;minimal talent&quot;, which was &quot;grossly exaggerated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Conquest (1979), 236&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;This is an accusation less against the fantastic arrogance of Pound&quot;, he wrote, &quot;than against the narrow-minded obscurantism of the departments of English and the critical establishment who have set up a system of apologetics which the slyest Jesuit of the seventeenth century would have baulked at.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Conquest (1979), 243&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Samuel Putnam]], those who respected Pound's poetry were less likely to respect his prose or work as a critic.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam (1947), 141&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 1773, eleven years after first meeting [[James Boswell|Boswell]], Johnson set out to visit his friend in Scotland, and to begin &quot;a journey to the western islands of Scotland&quot;, as Johnson's 1775 account of their travels would put it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was intended to discuss the social problems and struggles that affected the Scottish people, but it also praised many of the unique facets of Scottish society, such as a school in Edinburgh for the deaf and mute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Johnson used the work to enter into the dispute over the authenticity of [[James Macpherson|James Macpherson's]] [[Ossian]] poems, claiming they could not have been translations of ancient Scottish literature on the grounds that &quot;in those times nothing had been written in the Earse [i.e. Scots Gaelic] language&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1970|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were heated exchanges between the two, and according to one of Johnson's letters, MacPherson threatened physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wain|1974|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell's account of their journey, ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' (1786), was a preliminary step toward his later biography, ''[[Life of Johnson|The Life of Samuel Johnson]]''. Included were various quotations and descriptions of events, including anecdotes such as Johnson swinging a [[Basket-hilted sword|broadsword]] while wearing Scottish garb, or dancing a Highland jig.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=468–469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1770s, Johnson, who had tended to be an opponent of the government early in life, published a series of pamphlets in favour of various government policies. In 1770 he produced ''The False Alarm'', a political pamphlet attacking [[John Wilkes]]. In 1771, his ''Thoughts on the Late Transactions Respecting Falkland's Islands'' cautioned against war with Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=443–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1774 he printed ''The Patriot'', a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. On the evening of 7 April 1775, he made the famous statement, &quot;Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; This line was not, as widely believed, about patriotism in general, but what Johnson considered to be the false use of the term &quot;patriotism&quot; by [[John Wilkes]] and his supporters. Johnson opposed &quot;self-professed Patriots&quot; in general, but valued what he considered &quot;true&quot; patriotism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffin p. 21&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffin|2005|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last of these pamphlets, ''Taxation No Tyranny'' (1775), was a defence of the [[Coercive Acts]] and a response to the [[Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress|Declaration of Rights]] of the [[First Continental Congress]], which protested against [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson argued that in emigrating to America, colonists had &quot;voluntarily resigned the power of voting&quot;, but they still retained &quot;[[virtual representation]]&quot; in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights, Johnson suggested that the Americans had no more right to govern themselves than the [[Cornish people|Cornish]], and asked &quot;How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the [[Slavery in the colonial United States|drivers of negroes]]?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Samuel, TAXATION NO TYRANNY; An answer to the resolutions and address of the American congress (1775)&lt;/ref&gt; If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament, said Johnson, they could move to England and purchase an estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ammerman|1974|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson denounced English supporters of American separatists as &quot;traitors to this country&quot;, and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but he felt confident that it would end with &quot;English superiority and American obedience&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DeMaria|1994|pp=252–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years before, Johnson had stated that the [[French and Indian War]] was a conflict between &quot;two robbers&quot; of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands, and that neither deserved to live there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 328&quot; /&gt; After the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]], marking the colonists' victory over the British, Johnson became &quot;deeply disturbed&quot; with the &quot;state of this kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffin|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Mr Thrale's death was a very essential loss to Johnson, who, although he did not foresee all that afterwards happened, was sufficiently convinced that the comforts which Mr Thrale's family afforded him, would now in great measure cease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell p. 273&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p= 273}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Boswell's ''Life of Samuel Johnson''}}

On 3 May 1777, while Johnson was trying to save [[William Dodd (clergyman)|Reverend William Dodd]] from execution, he wrote to Boswell that he was busy preparing a &quot;little Lives&quot; and &quot;little Prefaces, to a little edition of the English Poets&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Davies, William Strahan and Thomas Cadell had asked Johnson to create this final major work, the ''[[Lives of the English Poets]]'', for which he asked 200 guineas, an amount significantly less than the price he could have demanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 526&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lives'', which were critical as well as biographical studies, appeared as prefaces to selections of each poet's work, and they were longer and more detailed than originally expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=527}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was finished in March 1781 and the whole collection was published in six volumes. As Johnson justified in the advertisement for the work, &quot;my purpose was only to have allotted to every Poet an Advertisement, like those which we find in the French Miscellanies, containing a few dates and a general character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clingham|1997|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was unable to enjoy this success because [[Henry Thrale]], the dear friend with whom he lived, died on 4 April 1781.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=546–547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life changed quickly for Johnson when [[Hester Thrale]] became romantically involved with the Italian singing teacher Gabriel Mario Piozzi, which forced Johnson to change his previous lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=557,&amp;nbsp;561}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning home and then travelling for a short period, Johnson received word that his friend and tenant [[Robert Levet]], had died on 17 January 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was shocked by the death of Levet, who had resided at Johnson's London home since 1762.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXHv5EClgZgC&amp;q=wakefield+levett&amp;pg=PA231|title= The Samuel Johnson Encyclopedia|author=Rogers, Pat|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location= Westport, CT|year=1996|isbn=978-0-313-29411-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards Johnson caught a cold that developed into bronchitis and lasted for several months. His health was further complicated by &quot;feeling forlorn and lonely&quot; over Levet's death, and by the deaths of his friend [[Thomas Lawrence (physician)|Thomas Lawrence]] and his housekeeper Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|2008|pp=501–502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hester Thrale.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Grandly dressed woman, seated, with her daughter kneeling on her right|[[Hester Thrale]] and her daughter Queeney]]

Although he had recovered his health by August, he experienced emotional trauma when he was given word that Hester Thrale would sell the residence that Johnson shared with the family. What hurt Johnson most was the possibility that he would be left without her constant company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 566&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Months later, on 6 October 1782, Johnson attended church for the final time in his life, to say goodbye to his former residence and life. The walk to the church strained him, but he managed the journey unaccompanied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 569&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he wrote a prayer for the Thrale family:

{{quote|To thy fatherly protection, O Lord, I commend this family. Bless, guide, and defend them, that they may pass through this world, as finally to enjoy in thy presence everlasting happiness, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hester Thrale did not completely abandon Johnson, and asked him to accompany the family on a trip to [[Brighton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 569&quot; /&gt; He agreed, and was with them from 7 October to 20 November 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=570}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, his health began to fail, and he was left alone after [[James Boswell|Boswell's]] visit on 29 May 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 1783, Johnson's poor circulation resulted in a stroke&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiltshire|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote to his neighbour, Edmund Allen, that he had lost the ability to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two doctors were brought in to aid Johnson; he regained his ability to speak two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson feared that he was dying, and wrote:

{{quote|The black dog I hope always to resist, and in time to drive, though I am deprived of almost all those that used to help me. The neighbourhood is impoverished. I had once Richardson and Lawrence in my reach. Mrs. Allen is dead. My house has lost Levet, a man who took interest in everything, and therefore ready at conversation. Mrs. Williams is so weak that she can be a companion no longer. When I rise my breakfast is solitary, the black dog waits to share it, from breakfast to dinner he continues barking, except that Dr. Brocklesby for a little keeps him at a distance. Dinner with a sick woman you may venture to suppose not much better than solitary. After dinner, what remains but to count the clock, and hope for that sleep which I can scarce expect. Night comes at last, and some hours of restlessness and confusion bring me again to a day of solitude. What shall exclude the black dog from an habitation like this?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
By this time he was sick and [[gout|gout-ridden]]. He had surgery for gout, and his remaining friends, including novelist [[Frances Burney|Fanny Burney]] (the daughter of Charles Burney), came to keep him company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.73&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was confined to his room from 14 December 1783 to 21 April 1784.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.74&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His health began to improve by May 1784, and he travelled to Oxford with Boswell on 5 May 1784.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.74&quot; /&gt; By July, many of Johnson's friends were either dead or gone; Boswell had left for Scotland and Hester Thrale had become engaged to Piozzi. With no one to visit, Johnson expressed a desire to die in London and arrived there on 16 November 1784. On 25 November 1784, he allowed Burney to visit him and expressed an interest to her that he should leave London; he soon left for [[Islington]], to George Strahan's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final moments were filled with mental anguish and delusions; when his physician, Thomas Warren, visited and asked him if he were feeling better, Johnson burst out with: &quot;No, Sir; you cannot conceive with what acceleration I advance towards death.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.78&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=A few days before his death, he had asked Sir John Hawkins, one of his executors, where he should be buried; and on being answered, &quot;Doubtless, in Westminster Abbey,&quot; seemed to feel a satisfaction, very natural to a Poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Boswell's ''Life of Samuel Johnson''}}

Many visitors came to see Johnson as he lay sick in bed, but he preferred only Langton's company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.78&quot; /&gt; Burney waited for word of Johnson's condition, along with Windham, Strahan, Hoole, Cruikshank, Des Moulins and Barber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.79&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December 1784, Johnson met with two others: a young woman, Miss Morris, whom Johnson blessed, and Francesco Sastres, an Italian teacher, who was given some of Johnson's final words: &quot;''Iam Moriturus''&quot; (&quot;I who am about to die&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 599&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards he fell into a coma, and died at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.79&quot; /&gt;

Langton waited until 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to tell the others, which led to John Hawkins' becoming pale and overcome with &quot;an agony of mind&quot;, along with Seward and Hoole describing Johnson's death as &quot;the most awful sight&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|1897|p=160 (Vol. 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell remarked, &quot;My feeling was just one large expanse of Stupor&amp;nbsp;... I could not believe it. My imagination was not convinced.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 599&quot; /&gt; [[William Gerard Hamilton]] joined in and stated, &quot;He has made a chasm, which not only nothing can fill up, but which ''nothing has a tendency to fill up''. –Johnson is dead.– Let us go to the next best: There is nobody; –''no man can be said to put you in mind of Johnson''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.79&quot; /&gt;

He was buried on 20 December 1784 at [[Westminster Abbey]] with an inscription that reads:
:Samuel Johnson, [[LL.D.]]
:''Obiit XIII die Decembris,''
:''Anno Domini''
:M.DCC.LXXXIV.

== Literary criticism ==
{{Main|Samuel Johnson's literary criticism}}

[[File:Vanity of Human Wishes.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Vanity of Human Wishes'' (1749) title page]]

Johnson's works, especially his ''Lives of the Poets'' series, describe various features of excellent writing. He believed that the best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposefully archaic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|1982|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose [[blank verse]] he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary [[Thomas Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's ''Lycidas'' were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his smaller poetic works, Johnson relied on short lines and filled his work with a feeling of empathy, which possibly influenced [[Housman]]'s poetic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=31, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''London'', his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his second imitation, ''The Vanity of Human Wishes'', is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo and the muses, inflicting penance on Dr Pomposo, round Parnassus' (Samuel Johnson) by James Gillray.jpg|left|thumb|A caricature of Johnson by [[James Gillray]] mocking him for his literary criticism; he is shown doing penance for [[Apollo]] and the [[Muse]]s with [[Mount Parnassus]] in the background.]]
When it came to biography, Johnson disagreed with [[Plutarch]]'s use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that could be viewed as tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of ''Rambler'' 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus in his ''Lives of the Poets'' he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in ''Idler'' 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's thoughts on biography and on poetry coalesced in his understanding of what would make a good critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism. This was especially true of his ''Dictionary'' of which he wrote: &quot;I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, ''for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism, or elegance of style''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a smaller edition of his ''Dictionary'' became the standard household dictionary, Johnson's original ''Dictionary'' was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from what he considered to be the most important literary fields: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotations and usages were all compared and carefully studied in the ''Dictionary'' so that a reader could understand what words in literary works meant in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plays of Shakespeare title page.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=&quot;&quot;|''Plays of William Shakespeare'' (1773 expanded edition) title page]]
Johnson did not attempt to create schools of theories to analyse the aesthetics of literature. Instead, he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language: &quot;If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such as we speak and hear every hour without observing them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green p. 141&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works on Shakespeare were devoted not merely to Shakespeare, but to understanding literature as a whole; in his ''Preface'' to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the [[classical unities]] and argues that drama should be faithful to life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene p. 142&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|1982|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it, 'I refute it ''thus''.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell p. 122&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Boswell's ''Life of Samuel Johnson''}}

Johnson was a devout, conservative [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and a compassionate man who supported a number of poor friends under his own roof, even when unable to fully provide for himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate Achievement p. 36&quot; /&gt; Johnson's Christian morality permeated his works, and he would write on moral topics with such authority and in such a trusting manner that, Walter Jackson Bate claims, &quot;no other moralist in history excels or even begins to rival him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Johnson's moral writings do not contain, as [[Donald Greene]] points out, &quot;a predetermined and authori&lt;!-- quote --&gt;zed pattern of 'good behav&lt;!-- quote --&gt;ior{{' &quot;}}, even though Johnson does emphasise certain kinds of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not let his own faith prejudice him against others, and had respect for those of other denominations who demonstrated a commitment to Christ's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Johnson respected [[John Milton]]'s poetry, he could not tolerate Milton's Puritan and Republican beliefs, feeling that they were contrary to England and Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 537&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=537}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an opponent of slavery on moral grounds, and once proposed a toast to the &quot;next rebellion of the negroes in the West Indies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside his beliefs concerning humanity, Johnson is also known for his love of cats,&lt;ref name=&quot;Skargon&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Skargon|1999|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially his own two cats, [[Hodge (cat)|Hodge]] and Lily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skargon&quot; /&gt; Boswell wrote, &quot;I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was also known as a staunch [[Tory]]; he admitted to sympathies for the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause during his younger years but, by the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], he came to accept the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Hanoverian Succession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 537&quot; /&gt; It was Boswell who gave people the impression that Johnson was an &quot;arch-conservative&quot;, and it was Boswell, more than anyone else, who determined how Johnson would be seen by people years later. However, Boswell was not around for two of Johnson's most politically active periods: during Walpole's control over British Parliament and during the Seven Years' War. Although Boswell was present with Johnson during the 1770s and describes four major pamphlets written by Johnson, he neglects to discuss them because he is more interested in their travels to Scotland. This is compounded by the fact that Boswell held an opinion contradictory to two of these pamphlets, ''The False Alarm'' and ''Taxation No Tyranny'', and so attacks Johnson's views in his biography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|2000|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Life of Samuel Johnson'' Boswell referred to Johnson as 'Dr. Johnson' so often that he would always be known as such, even though he hated being called such. Boswell's emphasis on Johnson's later years shows him too often as merely an old man discoursing in a tavern to a circle of admirers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Boswell, a Scotsman, was a close companion and friend to Johnson during many important times of his life, like many of his fellow Englishmen Johnson had a reputation for despising Scotland and its people. Even during their journey together through Scotland, Johnson &quot;exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1995|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hester Thrale, in summarising Johnson's nationalistic views and his anti-Scottish prejudice, said: &quot;We all know how well he loved to abuse the Scotch, &amp; indeed to be abused by them in return.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Piozzi|1951|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
{{Main|Samuel Johnson's health}}
Johnson had several health problems, including childhood [[scrofula|tuberculous scrofula]] resulting in deep facial scarring, deafness in one ear and blindness in one eye, [[gout]], [[testicular cancer]], and a stroke in his final year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had [[pulmonary fibrosis]] along with [[cardiac failure]] probably due to [[hypertension]], a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and [[Tourette syndrome]].

There are many accounts of Johnson suffering from bouts of depression and what Johnson thought might be madness. As Walter Jackson Bate puts it, &quot;one of the ironies of literary history is that its most compelling and authoritative symbol of common sense—of the strong, imaginative grasp of concrete reality—should have begun his adult life, at the age of twenty, in a state of such intense anxiety and bewildered despair that, at least from his own point of view, it seemed the onset of actual insanity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1955|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome these feelings, Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities, but this did not seem to help. Taylor said that Johnson &quot;at one time strongly entertained thoughts of suicide&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 116&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell claimed that Johnson &quot;felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible melancholia, with perpetual irritation, fretfulness, and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and despair, which made existence misery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 117&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johnson 1769.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Reynolds' 1769 portrait depicting Johnson's &quot;odd gesticulations&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Early on, when Johnson was unable to pay off his debts, he began to work with professional writers and identified his own situation with theirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pittock p. 159&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pittock|2004|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Johnson witnessed [[Christopher Smart]]'s decline into &quot;penury and the madhouse&quot;, and feared that he might share the same fate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pittock p. 159&quot; /&gt; Hester Thrale Piozzi claimed, in a discussion on Smart's mental state, that Johnson was her &quot;friend who feared an apple should intoxicate him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keymer p. 186&quot; /&gt; To her, what separated Johnson from others who were placed in asylums for madness—like Christopher Smart—was his ability to keep his concerns and emotions to himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keymer p. 186&quot; /&gt;

Two hundred years after Johnson's death, the posthumous diagnosis of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stern|Burza|Robertson|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of Tourette syndrome|condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime]], but Boswell describes Johnson [[Societal and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome#Samuel Johnson|displaying signs of Tourette syndrome]], including [[tic]]s and other involuntary movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearce p. 396&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearce|1994|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray p. 1610&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Murray|1979|p=1610}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Boswell &quot;he commonly held his head to one side&amp;nbsp;... moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand&amp;nbsp;... [H]e made various sounds&quot; like &quot;a half whistle&quot; or &quot;as if clucking like a hen&quot;, and &quot;... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a whale.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibbert p. 203&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1971|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to &quot;perform his gesticulations&quot; at the threshold of a house or in doorways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1971|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: &quot;From bad habit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibbert p. 203&quot; /&gt; The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McHenry|1967|pp=152–168}} and {{Harvnb|Wiltshire|1991|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tourette syndrome researcher [[Arthur K. Shapiro]] described Johnson as &quot;the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|1978|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details provided by the writings of Boswell, Hester Thrale, and others reinforce the diagnosis, with one paper concluding:

{{quote|[Johnson] also displayed many of the obsessional-compulsive traits and rituals which are associated with this syndrome&amp;nbsp;... It may be thought that without this illness Dr Johnson's remarkable literary achievements, the great dictionary, his philosophical deliberations and his conversations may never have happened; and Boswell, the author of the greatest of biographies would have been unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearce p. 398&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearce|1994|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Legacy ==
[[File:Samuel Johnson Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Dr Johnson erected in 1838 opposite the house where he was born at Lichfield's Market Square. There are also statues of him in London and Uttoxeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/issue_pdf/frontmatter_pdf/s11-IV/88.pdf|title=Notes and Queries – Oxford Academic|website=OUP Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Johnson was, in the words of Steven Lynn, &quot;more than a well-known writer and scholar&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynn|1997|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was a celebrity for the activities and the state of his health in his later years were constantly reported in various journals and newspapers, and when there was nothing to report, something was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynn|1997|pp=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bate, &quot;Johnson loved biography,&quot; and he &quot;changed the whole course of biography for the modern world. One by-product was the most famous single work of biographical art in the whole of literature, Boswell's ''Life of Johnson'', and there were many other memoirs and biographies of a similar kind written on Johnson after his death.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Batexix&quot; /&gt; These [[List of contemporary accounts of Samuel Johnson's life|accounts of his life]] include [[Thomas Tyers]]'s ''[[A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson]]'' (1784);&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|1897|p=335 (Vol. 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell's ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' (1785); [[Hester Thrale]]'s ''[[Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson]]'', which drew on entries from [[Thraliana|her diary]] and other notes;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloom|1998|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hawkins (author)|John Hawkins]]'s ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson (Hawkins book)|Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', the first full-length biography of Johnson;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davis|1961|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1792, [[Arthur Murphy (writer)|Arthur Murphy]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Life and Genius of Samuel Johnson]]'', which replaced Hawkins's biography as the introduction to a collection of Johnson's ''Works''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|1897|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important source was Fanny Burney, who described Johnson as &quot;the acknowledged Head of Literature in this kingdom&quot; and kept a diary containing details missing from other biographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2000|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, Boswell's portrayal of Johnson is the work best known to general readers. Although critics like Donald Greene argue about its status as a true biography, the work became successful as Boswell and his friends promoted it at the expense of the many other works on Johnson's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In criticism, Johnson had a lasting influence, although not everyone viewed him favourably. Some, like [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]], regarded Johnson as an [[Savant syndrome|idiot savant]] who produced some respectable works, and others, like the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poets]], were completely opposed to Johnson's views on poetry and literature, especially with regard to [[John Milton|Milton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn p. 245&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynn|1997|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of their contemporaries disagreed: [[Stendhal]]'s ''Racine et Shakespeare'' is based in part on Johnson's views of Shakespeare,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene p. 142&quot; /&gt; and Johnson influenced [[Jane Austen]]'s writing style and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grundy|1997|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Johnson's works came into favour, and [[Matthew Arnold]], in his ''Six Chief Lives from Johnson's &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;'', considered the ''Lives'' of Milton, [[John Dryden|Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], and [[Thomas Gray|Gray]] as &quot;points which stand as so many natural centres, and by returning to which we can always find our way again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arnold|1972|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than a century after his death, literary critics such as [[George Birkbeck Norman Hill|G. Birkbeck Hill]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] came to regard Johnson as a serious critic. They began to study Johnson's works with an increasing focus on the critical analysis found in his edition of Shakespeare and ''Lives of the Poets''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn p. 245&quot; /&gt; [[Yvor Winters]] claimed that &quot;A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winters p. 240&quot; /&gt; [[F. R. Leavis]] agreed and, on Johnson's criticism, said, &quot;When we read him we know, beyond question, that we have here a powerful and distinguished mind operating at first hand upon literature. This, we can say with emphatic conviction, really ''is'' criticism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|1950|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Wilson]] claimed that &quot;The ''Lives of the Poets'' and the prefaces and commentary on Shakespeare are among the most brilliant and the most acute documents in the whole range of English criticism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winters p. 240&quot; /&gt;

The critic [[Harold Bloom]] placed Johnson's work firmly within the [[Western canon]], describing him as &quot;unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him&amp;nbsp;... Bate in the finest insight on Johnson I know, emphasised that no other writer is so obsessed by the realisation that the mind is an ''activity'', one that will turn to destructiveness of the self or of others unless it is directed to labour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloom|1995|pp=183, 200}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is no wonder that his philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of [[literary theory]] during the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Samuel Johnson by Joseph Nollekens 1777.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Johnson by [[Joseph Nollekens]], 1777.]]
There are many societies formed around and dedicated to the study and enjoyment of Samuel Johnson's life and works. On the bicentennial of Johnson's death in 1984, Oxford University held a week-long conference featuring 50 papers, and the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] held an exhibit of &quot;Johnsonian portraits and other memorabilia&quot;. The London ''[[The Times|Times]]'' and ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' produced parodies of Johnson's style for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[BBC Four]] television channel started the [[Samuel Johnson Prize]], an award for non-fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/books/features/samueljohnson/|title=Samuel Johnson Prize 2008|publisher=BBC |accessdate=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Half of Johnson's surviving correspondence, together with some of his manuscripts, editions of his books, paintings and other items associated with him are in the Donald and [[Mary Eccles, Viscountess Eccles|Mary Hyde]] Collection of Dr. Samuel Johnson, housed at [[Houghton Library]] at [[Harvard University]] since 2003. Materials in the collection may be accessed through the Houghton Reading Room. The collection includes drafts of his ''Plan for a Dictionary'', documents associated with Hester Thrale Piozzi and James Boswell (including corrected proofs of his ''Life of Johnson'') and a teapot owned by Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton/collections/hyde.cfm|title=The Donald and Mary Hyde Collection of Dr. Samuel Johnson and Early Modern Books and Manuscripts|publisher=Harvard College Library|accessdate=10 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224190409/http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton/collections/hyde.cfm#|archive-date=24 December 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

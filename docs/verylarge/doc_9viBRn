'''''Led Zeppelin III''''' is the third [[studio album]] by the English [[rock music|rock]] band [[Led Zeppelin]], released in October 1970. It showed a progression from straightforward rock towards [[folk music|folk]] and acoustic music.

While hard rock influences were still present, such as on &quot;[[Immigrant Song]]&quot;, acoustic-based songs such as &quot;[[The Maid Freed from the Gallows#Led Zeppelin version|Gallows Pole]]&quot; and &quot;[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]&quot; showed Led Zeppelin were capable of playing different styles successfully. The band wrote most of the material themselves, but as with prior records, included two songs that were re-interpretations of earlier works: &quot;Gallows Pole&quot;, based on a traditional English folk song, by way of American singer [[Fred Gerlach]]; and &quot;Hats Off to (Roy) Harper&quot;, a reworking of a blues song by [[Bukka White]].

The acoustic material developed from a songwriting session between band members [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]] at [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage in Wales, which influenced the musical direction. The songs were recorded in three locations. Much of the work was done at [[Headley Grange]], a country house, using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]. Additional sessions were held in more traditional recording studios, such as [[Sarm West Studios|Island Studios]] and [[Olympic Studios]] in London. As with the prior album, the band eschewed the use of guest musicians, with all music performed by band members Page (guitars), Plant (vocals), [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass, keyboards), and [[John Bonham]] (drums). The range of instruments played by the band was greatly enhanced on this album, with Jones especially emerging as a talented multi-instrumentalist, playing a wide range of keyboard and stringed instruments, including various [[synthesizer]]s, [[mandolin]] and [[double bass]], in addition to his usual bass guitar. As with prior albums, Page served as producer on the album, with mixing done by [[Andy Johns]] and [[Terry Manning]].

The album was one of the most anticipated of 1970, and its shipping date was held up by the intricate inner sleeve design based around a [[volvelle]], with numerous images visible through holes in the outer cover. It was an immediate commercial success upon release and topped the UK and US charts. Although critics were typically confused over the change in musical style and gave the album a mixed response, ''Led Zeppelin III'' has since been acknowledged as representing an important milestone in the band's history and a turning point in their music.

==Background==
[[File:Bron-y-aur - geograph.org.uk - 21107 (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|right|Three songs on ''Led Zeppelin III'' were written by [[Jimmy Page|Page]] and [[Robert Plant|Plant]] while holidaying in [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Phil Sutcliffe|title=Back to Nature|journal=Q Magazine Special Led Zeppelin Edition|date=2003|page= 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By 1970, Led Zeppelin had achieved commercial success in both the UK and the US with their first two albums. They were determined to have a proper break, having recorded most of ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' in various locations while on tour, financing the sessions with the album sales and tour receipts.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Following an exhausting [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour Spring 1970|concert tour of North America]] that spring, lead singer [[Robert Plant]] recommended to guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]] that they should retreat to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], an 18th-century cottage in [[Snowdonia]], Wales, on a hilltop overlooking the [[River Dyfi|Dyfi Valley]], {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} north of the market town [[Machynlleth]]. Plant had spent holidays there with his family.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|McParland|2018|p=29}}

This remote setting had no running water or electric power, which encouraged a slight change of musical direction for the band towards an emphasis on acoustic arrangements.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|Welch|1994|pp=52, 55}} Page later explained that the tranquillity of Bron-Yr-Aur stood in sharp contrast to the continual touring of 1969, affecting the overall tone of the songwriting and dominance of acoustic guitars.&lt;ref name=Schulps&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Schulps|url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp|title=Interview with Jimmy Page|publisher=[[Trouser Press]]|date=October 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; His playing was influenced by folk guitarists [[Davey Graham]] and [[Bert Jansch]], who regularly used alternative guitar tunings. Plant also recalled the band were &quot;obsessed with change&quot; and enjoyed listening to [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]].&lt;ref name=williamson&gt;{{cite journal|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|authorlink=Nigel Williamson|title=Good Times...Bad Times|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=May 2005|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band specifically wanted a change in direction, to show they could play any style of music they wanted.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=96}}

==Recording==
The first recording sessions for ''Led Zeppelin III'' took place at [[Olympic Studios]] in November 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}} A press statement from manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] said the group were recording a non-album track to be released as a single, but this was ultimately abandoned. Further sessions took place towards the end of the year, in between touring, before the decision was made to stop working and take a break at Bron-Yr-Aur.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=74}} After preparing material for the album there, Page and Plant were joined by drummer [[John Bonham]] and bassist/keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] at [[Headley Grange]], a mansion in [[East Hampshire]], to rehearse the songs. The rural atmosphere gave a relaxed feel to the sessions, and the band found it to be a more enjoyable environment in which to develop songs than a studio in the city.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}

The album was recorded between May and June 1970 at Headley Grange (using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]) and at Olympic, with further recording at Island Records' [[Basing Street Studios]] in [[Notting Hill]] the following month. Mixing took place at Ardent Studios, [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], in August 1970, partway through the group's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour Summer 1970|sixth American concert tour]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=76}} The album was produced by Page and engineered by [[Andy Johns]] and [[Terry Manning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Led Zeppelin III|publisher=Atlantic Records|id=K50002|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page had first met Manning when the latter's band, [[Lawson and Four More]], had supported Page's old band [[the Yardbirds]] in 1966. Manning had been to several Led Zeppelin shows, and this led to Page asking him to engineer the new album.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=77}}

==Songs==
''Led Zeppelin III'' marked a change in focus for the band, from late 1960s hard rock to a [[psychedelic folk]] and [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sound.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} These styles had been present to a lesser degree on the band's first two releases, such as &quot;[[Babe I'm Gonna Leave You]]&quot; and &quot;[[Ramble On]]&quot;, from the first and second albums, respectively. However, on this album, the group used more acoustic arrangements, and they would remain prominent to various degrees in the group's later releases.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=73,75}} With ''Led Zeppelin III'', the group's songwriting dynamic also changed, from Page's domination of the first two albums towards a more democratic situation in which all four group members contributed their own compositions and ideas.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Plant wrote all of the lyrics, with the exception of &quot;Tangerine&quot;.&lt;ref name=MM70/&gt;

===Side one===
&quot;[[Immigrant Song]]&quot; was written about the [[Viking invasions of England]] and inspired by a [[Led Zeppelin Tour of Iceland, Bath and Germany, Summer 1970|short tour of Iceland]] in June 1970. It was released as a single in the US and became a top 20 hit. It was the opening song for the band's appearance at the [[Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music]] and at subsequent gigs for the next two years.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} It was popularised in the 2003 movie ''[[School of Rock]]'', after [[Jack Black]] made a short video with fans asking for permission for its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/led-zeppelin-allow-song-to-be-used-in-school-of-rock-movie/|title=LED ZEPPELIN Allow Song To Be Used In 'School Of Rock' Movie|website=Blabbermouth|date=8 September 2003|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page clarified that the song's opening is a combination of a voice and echo feedback.&lt;ref name=MM70&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/led-zeppelin-page-on-zeppelin-iii|title=Led Zeppelin: Page on Zeppelin III|first=Chris|last=Welch|work=Melody Maker|date=24 October 1970|via=[[Rock's Backpages]]|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Friends&quot; is an acoustic track that uses a [[C6 tuning]] on guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/magazine/50-greatest-led-zeppelin-songs|title=The 50 Greatest Led Zeppelin Songs|first=Jimmy|last=Brown|magazine=Guitar World|date=9 January 2015|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Alfred|2010|p=3}} Page explained: &quot;I played a [[Harmony Company|Harmony]] acoustic tuned to C–A–C–G–C–E on 'Friends'{{nbsp}}... It's a C [type] tuning, but not a [typical] C tuning. I made it up.&quot;{{sfn|Alfred|2010|p=3}}  The song includes a [[string section]] arranged by Jones, which Page had wanted to achieve an Indian style of sound.&lt;ref name=MM70/&gt; The song was re-recorded as an experimental arrangement with the Bombay Orchestra in March 1972, along with &quot;Four Sticks&quot; from the following untitled album, commonly known as ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' (1971).{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=49–50}} That arrangement appeared on the 2015 reissue of the retrospective album ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/passage-to-india-the-true-story-of-zeppelin-s-secret-bombay-sessions|title=Led Zeppelin in India: the true story behind the secret Bombay sessions|work=Louder|date=23 July 2015|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song segues into &quot;Celebration Day&quot; via a [[Moog synthesiser]] drone.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=49–50}}

&quot;[[Since I've Been Loving You]]&quot; was one of the first songs to be written for the album, in late 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} It is a blues song in the key of [[C minor]], featuring Jones on [[Hammond organ]] and bass pedals, simultaneously.&lt;ref name=MM70/&gt; The song became a live performance staple for the band throughout the rest of their career, replacing &quot;[[I Can't Quit You Baby]]&quot; from the [[Led Zeppelin (album)|first album]] as the band's slow blues showcase, with Page's guitar solo featured on both the recorded version and in the band's live show.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=47,50}}

&quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; was written by Bonham, who came up with the idea for the riffs that run through the track. The introduction was used to open live versions of &quot;[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]&quot; (from ''Led Zeppelin IV'') and Bonham's drum solo on the 1977 US tour.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}

===Side two===
&quot;[[The Maid Freed from the Gallows#Led Zeppelin version|Gallows Pole]]&quot; is an updated arrangement of a traditional folk song called &quot;[[The Maid Freed from the Gallows]]&quot;, inspired by a version recorded by [[Fred Gerlach]]. Page played a variety of acoustic and electric guitars and banjo, while Jones played mandolin as well as bass.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}} It was reworked by Page and Plant for their 1994 album ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r207800/review|title=''No Quarter'': Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded – Review|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|website=AllMusic|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Tangerine (Led Zeppelin song)|Tangerine]]&quot; was written by Page in 1968, when the Yardbirds were still together. The track features [[pedal steel guitar]] as well as acoustic. It was added to the group's live acoustic set in 1971 and performed regularly into the following year. It was then revived as a four-part harmony arrangement in 1975.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}

&quot;[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]&quot; had the original title of &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot;. It was written in Bron-Yr-Aur about the problems two people faced in a relationship and the clashes with their families. The song became a staple part of the group's acoustic set throughout the 1970s and was played at the Bath Festival, where Led Zeppelin performed acoustically for the first time in the UK.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=72}} Page thought highly of Plant's lyrics and considered it a breakthrough in their development as a songwriting team.&lt;ref name=RS2006&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Mikal |title=The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin |journal=Rolling Stone |issue=1006 |date=10 August 2006 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-long-shadow-of-led-zeppelin-184055/ |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair had gone for a walk and, on their return, sat down by a ravine with a tape recorder, where Page started to play the tune, to which Plant improvised a verse.&lt;ref name=MM70/&gt;

&quot;[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]&quot; was originally called &quot;Jennings Farm Blues&quot; and recorded as an electric arrangement, at the end of 1969. It was subsequently reworked as an acoustic number and featured Bonham playing spoons. The closing track, &quot;Hats Off to (Roy) Harper&quot;, was based on the [[Bukka White]] blues song &quot;[[Shake 'Em On Down]]&quot; and named as a tribute to their friend and folk singer, [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]].

==Packaging and artwork==
[[File:Led Zeppelin III volvelle .jpg|alt=|thumb|The volvelle used on the front cover]]

''Led Zeppelin III'''s original [[vinyl record|vinyl]] edition was packaged in a gatefold sleeve with an innovative cover, designed by [[Zacron]], a multi-media artist whom Page had met in 1963 whilst Zacron was a student at [[Kingston College of Art]].{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=77}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zacron.com/view-item.asp?iid=4 |title=Zacron – Led Zeppelin III Rock album cover, strictly limited world edition plus 50 a/p's signed by Zacron Gallery |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117131508/https://www.zacron.com/view-item.asp?iid=4 |archivedate=17 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zacron subsequently graduated from the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and became a lecturer at the [[University of Leeds]]. Page asked him if he would help design a sleeve for the album and, on 24 January 1970, Zacron met the band at their gig at his university and agreed to do the cover. That spring, he met the band members individually and took a series of photos of each of them, which would be put into a collage.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=77–78}}

The cover and interior gatefold art consisted of a surreal collection of seemingly random images on a white background, many of them connected thematically with flight or aviation. Behind the front cover was a rotatable laminated card disc, or [[volvelle]], covered with more images, including photos of the band members, which showed through holes in the cover; moving an image into place behind one hole would usually bring one or two others into place behind other holes.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=78}} The back cover was a composite shot of the best photographs from the photography sessions. Zacron chose the images because he wanted to &quot;show them as the giant force they were in music&quot;.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=78}} In France, this album was released with a different album cover, simply showing a photo of the four band members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Led Zeppelin III|publisher=Atlantic Records|id=940 051|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zacron later said that, upon his completion of the artwork, Page telephoned him while he was in New York to express his satisfaction with the results, saying, &quot;I think it is fantastic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Hats Off to Zacron&quot;, [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'', December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later thought the artwork was unsatisfactory because of working to a deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Brad |last1=Tolinski |first2=Greg |last2=Di Bendetto |title=Light and Shade|journal=Guitar World|date=January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Led Zeppelin III'' was one of the most anticipated albums of 1970, and advance orders in the US alone were close to the million mark. The volvelle-designed sleeve held up production and caused a two-month delay.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} In the run-up to release, the group bought a full page advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' magazine at the end of September, which simply said, &quot;Thank you for making us the world's number one band.&quot;{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} The album was released in the US on 5 October, then in the UK on 23 October. It immediately topped the British charts.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=79}}

Although the band's expanding musical boundaries were greeted warmly by some, detractors attacked the heavier tracks as being mindless noise. In a review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', critic [[Lester Bangs]] praised &quot;That's the Way&quot; as &quot;beautiful and genuinely moving&quot;, while characterising the band's heavier songs as crude and little differentiated from each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS #71&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bangs |first1=Lester |authorlink=Lester Bangs|date=26 November 1970 |title=Records: Led Zeppelin III |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=71 |page=34 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others criticised the acoustic material for imitating the music of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]], which Page disputed, as the group had featured that style on their previous albums.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=96}}&lt;ref name=cameroncrowe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cameroncrowe.com/journalism/articles/crowe_eyesandears_journalism_led.html |title=Cameron Crowe interview Led Zeppelin |accessdate=7 November 2007 |date=18 March 1975 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024124033/http://www.cameroncrowe.com/journalism/articles/crowe_eyesandears_journalism_led.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Page has also said that the negative press given to the third album affected him so much that he did not give press interviews for 18 months after its release, adding that the criticism was one of the reasons why the following album contained no written information on it at all.&lt;ref name = Schulps /&gt; He later came to believe that journalists had little time to listen to the material and were simply looking for &quot;the new '[[Whole Lotta Love]]'&quot; instead of appreciating the material on its own merits.&lt;ref name=williamson2&gt;{{cite journal|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|title=Forget the Myths|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=May 2005|page=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A positive review came from [[Robert Christgau]], who originally assigned it an A-minus grade and wrote in his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; review for ''[[The Village Voice]]'': &quot;I have always approved theoretically of Led Zep's concept, and now the group has finally whipped it into shape. It's amazing to realize that Robert Plant's vocals can convey that same overbearing power when Page plays acoustic, as he does to great effect on several cuts here. No drum solos, either. Heavy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=7 January 1971|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg15.php|title=Consumer Guide (15)|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Led Zeppelin III'' was a [[wikt:transatlantic|trans-Atlantic]] number one hit. In the UK, it reached No.&amp;nbsp;1 on 7 November 1970 and remained on the chart for 40 weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/led%20zeppelin%20iii/|title=Led Zeppelin III|website=Official Charts|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=94}} In the US, it entered the chart at No.&amp;nbsp;3 on 24 October &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_gSkEAAAAMBAJ|quote=led zeppelin III.|title=Top LPs|journal=Billboard|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_gSkEAAAAMBAJ/page/n73 74]|date=24 October 1970|accessdate=27 August 2018|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached No.&amp;nbsp;1 the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uSkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=%22led+zeppelin+III%22&amp;pg=PA43|title=Top LPs|journal=Billboard|page=50|date=31 October 1970|accessdate=27 August 2018|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained on the chart for 19 weeks and was certified Gold on 8 October 1970.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=95}} However, following the lukewarm, if not confused and sometimes dismissive reception from critics, sales lagged after this initial peak.&lt;ref name=RS2006 /&gt;

Despite mostly indifferent reviews and lower sales than Led Zeppelin's previous two albums, ''Led Zeppelin III'''s reputation has recovered over time. The [[RIAA]] certified the album 2 times platinum in 1990, and 6 times platinum in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;ar=Led+Zeppelin&amp;ti=Led+Zeppelin+III#search_section|title=LED ZEPPELIN III search results|publisher=RIAA official website|at=If necessary, click Advanced, then click Format, then select Album, then click SEARCH}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 reissue of the album helped itself get back into the ''Billboard'' Top 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6656593/led-zeppelin-top-10-return-billboard-200 |title= Led Zeppelin Heading Back to the Top 10, Again|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |date=6 August 2015 |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the group's [[Led Zeppelin (album)#2014 reissue|self-titled debut album]] and their second album, ''[[Led Zeppelin II#2014 reissue|Led Zeppelin II]]'', the album was remastered and reissued on 2 June 2014. The reissue comes in six formats: a standard CD edition; a deluxe two-CD edition; a standard LP version; a deluxe two-LP version; a super deluxe two-CD plus two-LP version with a hardback book; and as high-resolution, 24-bit/96k digital downloads. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material containing alternative takes, backing tracks and the previously unreleased songs &quot;Bathroom Sound&quot;, &quot;[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp#&quot;Jennings Farm Blues&quot;|Jennings Farm Blues]]&quot; and &quot;Key to the Highway/Trouble in Mind&quot;. The LP versions replicate the original volvelle sleeve design. The reissue was released with an inverted colour version of the original album's artwork as its bonus disc's cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=13 March 2014|url=http://www.mojo4music.com/12781/led-zeppelin-remasters-arrive-last/|title=Led Zeppelin Remasters Arrive At Last|website=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reissue was met with widespread critical acclaim. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 98, based on 10 reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt; The bonus disc was hailed by ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' journalist Mark Richardson as &quot;easily the best&quot; of the three reissues.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitchfork&quot;/&gt; In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[David Fricke]] wrote of highlights in the bonus disc: {{&quot;'}}Jennings Farm Blues', an electric run at the folk gallop 'Bron-Y-Aur Stomp', shows Zeppelin exploring options, and the medley 'Keys to the Highway/Trouble in Mind', by Page and Plant, feels like a deep-blues breath before the next rush forward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS2014&quot;/&gt;

Water temperature changes of more than 1–2&amp;nbsp;°C (1.8–3.6&amp;nbsp;°F) or [[salinity]] changes can kill some species of coral. Under such environmental stresses, corals expel their [[Symbiodinium]]; without them coral tissues reveal the white of their skeletons, an event known as [[coral bleaching]].&lt;ref name=Hoegh&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hoegh-Guldberg, O. | title=Climate change, coral bleaching and the future of the world's coral reefs | journal=Marine and Freshwater Research | year=1999 | pages=839–66 | volume=50 | issue=8 | url=http://www.reef.edu.au/ohg/res-pic/HG%20papers/Hoegh-Guldberg%201999.pdf | doi=10.1071/MF99078 | author-link=Ove Hoegh-Guldberg (biologist) | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426010443/http://www.reef.edu.au/ohg/res-pic/HG%20papers/Hoegh-Guldberg%201999.pdf | archive-date=2012-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection===
{{Main|Coral reef protection}}

Marine Protected Areas, [[Biosphere reserves]], [[marine park]]s, [[national monument]]s [[world heritage]] status, [[Fisheries management|fishery management]] and [[habitat (ecology)|habitat protection]] can protect reefs from anthropogenic damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Phoenix Rising |magazine=National Geographic Magazine |date=January 2011 |access-date=April 30, 2011

Many governments now prohibit removal of coral from reefs, and inform coastal residents about reef protection and ecology. While local action such as habitat restoration and herbivore protection can reduce local damage, the longer-term threats of acidification, temperature change and sea-level rise remain a challenge.&lt;ref name=cra10/&gt;

=== Coral Health ===
To assess the threat level of coral, scientists developed a coral imbalance ratio, Log(Average abundance of disease associated taxa / Average abundance of healthy associated taxa). The lower the ratio the healthier the microbial community is. This ratio was developed after the microbial mucus of coral was collected and studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Health and Disease Signatures of the Coral Microbiome • iBiology|url=https://www.ibiology.org/microbiology/coral-microbiome/|website=iBiology|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to humans==
Local economies near major coral reefs benefit from an abundance of fish and other marine creatures as a food source. Reefs also provide recreational [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkeling]] tourism. These activities can damage coral but international projects such as [[Green Fins]] that encourage dive and snorkel centres to follow a Code of Conduct have been proven to mitigate these risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hunt |first1=Chloe V. |last2=Harvey |first2=James J. |last3=Miller |first3=Anne |last4=Johnson |first4=Vivienne |last5=Phongsuwan |first5=Niphon |year=2013 |title=The Green Fins approach for monitoring and promoting environmentally sustainable scuba diving operations in South East Asia |journal=Ocean &amp; Coastal Management |volume=78 |pages=35–44 |doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2013.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shoreline protection===

Increasing sea temperatures in tropical regions (~1 degree C) the last century have caused major coral bleaching, death, and therefore shrinking coral populations since although they are able to adapt and acclimate, it is uncertain if this evolutionary process will happen quickly enough to prevent major reduction of their numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoegh-Guldberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hoegh-Guldberg O. | title=Climate change, coral bleaching and the future of the world's coral reefs | journal=Marine and Freshwater Research | year=1999 | pages=839–99 | volume=50 | issue=8 | doi=10.1071/mf99078| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Geochemistry ====
Corals are shallow, colonial organisms that integrate oxygen and trace elements into their skeletal [[aragonite]] ([[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]] of [[calcite]]) crystalline structures as they grow. Geochemical anomalies within the crystalline structures of corals represent functions of temperature, salinity and oxygen isotopic composition. Such geochemical analysis can help with climate modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilbourne|first1=K.

The comparison of coral strontium/calcium minimums with sea surface temperature maximums, data recorded from [http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/gcos_wgsp/Timeseries/Nino34/ NINO 3.4 SSTA], time can be correlated to coral strontium/calcium and [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] variations. To confirm accuracy of the annual relationship between Sr/Ca and [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] variations, a perceptible association to annual coral growth rings confirms the age conversion. [[Geochronology]] is established by the blending of Sr/Ca data, growth rings, and [[Stable isotope ratio|stable isotope]] data. [[El Nino-Southern Oscillation|El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)]] is directly related to climate fluctuations that influence coral [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] ratio from local salinity variations associated with the position of the [[South Pacific convergence zone|South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ)]] and can be used for [[El Niño Southern Oscillation|ENSO]] modeling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ren, L. 2002&quot;/&gt;

Climate research on live coral species is limited to a few studied species. Studying ''[[Porites]]'' coral provides a stable foundation for geochemical interpretations that is much simpler to physically extract data in comparison to ''[[Platygyra]]'' species where the complexity of ''[[Platygyra]]'' species skeletal structure creates difficulty when physically sampled, which happens to be one of the only multidecadal living coral records used for coral [[paleoclimate]] modeling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukas, R. 1991&quot;/&gt;

The saltwater fishkeeping hobby has expanded, over recent years, to include [[Reef aquarium|reef tanks]], fish tanks that include large amounts of [[live rock]] on which coral is allowed to grow and spread.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advancedaquarist.com/2011/1/corals Aquarium Corals: Collection and Aquarium Husbandry of Northeast Pacific Non-Photosynthetic Cnidaria].

Saltaquarium.about.com. Retrieved on 2016-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to appear neat and clean.

The most popular kind of coral kept is [[soft coral]], especially [[zoanthid]]s and mushroom corals, which are especially easy to grow and propagate in a wide variety of conditions, because they originate in enclosed parts of reefs where water conditions vary and lighting may be less reliable and direct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marinebio.org/oceans/coral-reefs.asp Coral Reefs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121160400/http://marinebio.org/oceans/coral-reefs.asp |date=2013-01-21 }}.

[[File:Diverse torture instruments.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|A variety of real and fictitious torture instruments. Many, including the large [[Iron Maiden of Nuremberg]], were never used for torture.]]

'''Torture''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''tortus'': to twist, to torment) is the act of deliberately inflicting severe physical or psychological [[suffering]] on someone by another as a punishment or in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or force some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a [[mens rea|knowing and intentional act]]; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict suffering or pain, without a specific intent to do so, are not typically considered torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/23038/9-insane-torture-techniques |title = 9 Insane Torture Techniques|date = 19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals, groups, and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day, and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or longer. Reasons for torture can include [[punishment]], [[revenge]], [[extortion]], [[persuasion]], political [[re-education]], [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[coercion]] of the victim or a third party, [[interrogation]] to extract information or a [[confession]] irrespective of whether it is [[false confession|false]], or simply the [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.losangelescriminallawyer.pro/california-penal-code-section-206-pc-torture.html | title=California Penal Code Section 206 PC: Torture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.shouselaw.com/torture.html |title = Penal Code 206 – the crime of &quot;Torture&quot; in California law}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, some forms of torture are designed to inflict [[Psychological torture|psychological pain]] or leave as little physical injury or evidence as possible while achieving the same psychological devastation. The torturer may or may not kill or injure the victim, but torture may result in a [[murder|deliberate death]] and serves as a form of [[capital punishment]]. Depending on the aim, even a form of torture that is intentionally fatal may be prolonged to allow the victim to suffer as long as possible (such as [[half-hanging]]). In other cases, the torturer may be indifferent to the condition of the victim.

Although torture is sanctioned by some states, it is prohibited under [[international law]] and the [[domestic laws]] of most countries. Although widely illegal and reviled, there is an ongoing debate as to what exactly is and is not legally defined as torture. It is a serious violation of [[human rights]], and is declared to be unacceptable (but not illegal) by Article 5 of the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and the [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in [[armed conflicts]], whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited for the signatories of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], which has 163 state parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title= United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical, and information obtained by torture is far less reliable than that obtained by other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/014/2005/en |title=Torture and Ill-Treatment in the 'War on Terror' |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=22 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=general/&gt;&lt;ref name=reckoning/&gt; Despite these findings and international conventions, organizations that monitor abuses of human rights (e.g., [[Amnesty International]], the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], [[Freedom from Torture]], etc.) report widespread use condoned by states in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]] [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol10/001/2005/en/ Report 2005]  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070317170847/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/2af-summary-eng Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some of them openly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amnesty08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |title=Report 08: At a Glance |year=2008 |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202906/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |archivedate = 8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

===International level===

====UN Convention Against Torture====
The [[United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], which is currently in force since 26 June 1987, provides a broad definition of torture. Article 1.1 of the UN Convention Against Torture reads:
{{blockquote|For the purpose of this Convention, the term &quot;torture&quot; means any act by which severe [[pain]] or [[suffering]], whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him, or a third person, information or a [[Confession (law)|confession]], punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or [[intimidating]] or [[Coercion|coercing]] him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a [[public official]] or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm|title=A/RES/39/46. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|website=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition was restricted to apply only to nations and to government-sponsored torture and clearly limits the torture to that perpetrated, directly or indirectly, by those acting in an official capacity, such as [[government agency|government personnel]], [[law enforcement officers|law enforcement personnel]], [[medical personnel]], [[military personnel]], or [[politicians]]. It appears to exclude:
# torture perpetrated by [[gang]]s, [[hate group]]s, [[rebellion|rebel]]s, or [[terrorist]]s who ignore national or international mandates;
# random violence during war; and
# punishment allowed by national laws, even if the punishment uses techniques similar to those used by torturers such as [[mutilation]], [[flagellation|whipping]], or [[corporal punishment]] when practiced as [[criminal justice|lawful punishment]]. Some professionals in the torture rehabilitation field believe that this definition is too restrictive and that the definition of politically motivated torture should be broadened to include all acts of organized violence.&lt;ref&gt;James Jaranson, &quot;The Science and Politics of Rehabilitating Torture Survivors,&quot; in ''Caring for Victims of Torture,'' edited by Michael K. Popkin, Amer Psychiatric Pub Inc.1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Declaration of Tokyo====

An even broader definition was used in the 1975 [[Declaration of Tokyo]] regarding the participation of medical professionals in acts of torture:

:For the purpose of this Declaration, torture is defined as the deliberate, systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of any authority, to force another person to yield information, to make a confession, or for any other reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html World Medical Association, ''Declaration of Tokyo,'' 1975.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218203758/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html |date=18 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition includes torture as part of [[domestic violence]] or ritualistic abuse, as well as in criminal activities.

====Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court====
The [[Rome Statute]] is the [[treaty]] that set up the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). The treaty was adopted at a diplomatic conference in Rome on 17 July 1998 and went into effect on 1 July 2002. The Rome Statute provides the simplest definition of torture regarding the prosecution of [[war criminals]] by the International Criminal Court. Paragraph 1 under Article 7(e) of the Rome Statute provides that:

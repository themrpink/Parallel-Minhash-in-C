The [[Agriculture Act 1920]] provided for farm labourers to receive a minimum wage while the state continued to guarantee the prices of farm produce until 1921.

The [[National Health Insurance Act 1920]] increased insurance benefits, and eligibility for pensions was extended to more people.  The means limit for pensions was raised by about two-thirds, immigrants and their wives were allowed to receive pensions after living in Britain for ten years, and the imprisonment and &quot;failure to work&quot; disqualifications for receiving pensions were abolished.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The Blind Persons Act 1920 reduced the pension age for blind people from 70 to 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rnib.org.uk/nb-online/timeline|title=From 1917 to 2017: NB magazine's 100 years of eye health and sight loss|date=31 March 2017|publisher=RNIB|access-date=11 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old age pensions were nearly doubled (from £26 5s to £47 5s a year),&lt;ref name = &quot;Pugh1988p139&quot;/&gt; efforts were made to help returning soldiers find employment, and the [[Whitley Councils]] of employees and employers set up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pugh1988p119&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pugh|first=Martin|author-link=Martin Pugh (historian)|title=Lloyd George|series=Profiles in Power|year=1988|publisher=Longman|location=London and New York|isbn=0582552680|page=119|chapter=The Government of National Efficiency 1916-1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== What was the cost? ====
The reforming efforts of the Coalition Government were such that, according to the historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]], its achievements were greater than those of the pre-war Liberal governments; however, the reform programme was substantially rolled back by the [[Geddes Axe]], which cut public expenditure by £76&amp;nbsp;million, including substantial cuts to education,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pugh1988p142143&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pugh|first=Martin|author-link=Martin Pugh (historian)|title=Lloyd George|series=Profiles in Power|year=1988|publisher=Longman|location=London and New York|isbn=0582552680|pages=142–143|chapter=The Failure of the Centre Party 1918-1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abolished the Agricultural Wages Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hattersley|first=Roy|author-link=Roy Hattersley|title=David Lloyd George: The Great Outsider|year=2010|publisher=Little, Brown|location=London|isbn=9781408700976|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781408700976/page/529 529]|chapter=The Perils of Peace|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781408700976|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ireland ====
The armed insurrection by Irish republicans, known as the [[Easter Rising]], took place in [[Dublin]] during Easter Week, 1916.  The government responded with harsh repression; key leaders were quickly executed. The mostly Catholic Irish nationalists then underwent a dramatic change of mood, and shifted to demand vengeance and independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeffrey M. Shaw|author2=Timothy J.

Lloyd George presided over the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] which partitioned Ireland into [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] in May 1921 during the [[Anglo-Irish War]]. Lloyd George famously declared of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] that &quot;We have murder by the throat!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wrigley|first=Chris|title=Lloyd George|series=Historical Association Studies|year=1992|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford|isbn=0631166084|page=106|chapter=A Fit World and a Fit Land to Live in?}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he soon afterwards began negotiations with IRA leaders to recognise their authority and to end a bloody conflict. This culminated in the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] signed in December 1921 with Irish leaders. Under it Southern Ireland, representing over a fifth of the United Kingdom's territory, seceded in 1922 to form the [[Irish Free State]].

==== Foreign policy crises ====
[[File:2211-lloyd-george.jpg|thumb|Lloyd George in 1922]]
A series of foreign policy crises gave Lloyd George his last opportunity to hold national and international leadership. Everything went wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul W. Doerr|title=British Foreign Policy, 1919–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zumqs15aTfwC&amp;pg=PA58|year=1998|publisher=Manchester UP|pages=55–61|isbn=9780719046728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[League of Nations]] got off to a slow start and was largely ineffective. The Treaty of Versailles had set up a series of temporary organisations, composed of delegations from key powers, to ensure the successful application of the Treaty. The system worked poorly. The assembly of ambassadors was repeatedly overruled and became a nonentity.  Most of the commissions were deeply divided and unable to either make decisions or convince the interested parties to carry them out. The most important commission was on Reparations, and France seized full control of it.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Marks, ''The Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe, 1918–1933'' (2nd ed. 2003)  pp 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Poincaré]], president of France, was intensely anti-German, was unrelenting in his demands for huge reparations, and was repeatedly challenged by Germany. France finally invaded western Germany, and Berlin responded by imposing a runaway inflation that seriously damaged the German economy and also damaged the French economy.&lt;ref&gt;Carl-Ludwig Holtfrerich, '' The German Inflation 1914–1923: Causes and Effects in International Perspective'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2013) p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, after refusing to ratify the League in 1920, almost completely disassociated itself from it. In 1921, the U.S. set up its own international programme for world disarmament that led to the successful [[Washington Naval Conference]], leaving only a minor role for Britain. As the reparations crisis escalated, the United States seized control of it too, with the [[Dawes Plan]] of 1924 by which American banks loaned large sums to Germany, which paid reparations to the Allies, who in turn paid off their war loans to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, ''The Illusion of Peace'', pp 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Lloyd George successfully concluded the [[Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement]]. Despite much effort he was unable to negotiate full diplomatic relations, as the Russians rejected all repayment of Tsarist era debts, and Conservatives in Britain grew exceedingly wary of the communist threat to European stability. Indeed, [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Wilson]], the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, worried that Lloyd George had become &quot;a traitor &amp; a Bolshevist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrosbyReconstruction&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Crosby|first=Travis L.|title=The Unknown Lloyd George|year=2014|publisher=I. B. Tauris|location=London &amp; New York|isbn=9781780764856|chapter=13: Reconstruction and Resistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|276-279}} Lloyd George in 1922 set about to make himself master of peace in the world, especially through the [[Genoa Conference]] that he expected would rival Paris of 1919 in visibility, and restore his reputation. Poincaré and the French demanded a military alliance that was far beyond what the British would accept. Germany and Russia made their own [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|agreement at Rapallo]] which wrecked the Genoa conference.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, ''The Illusion of Peace'', p 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Lloyd George decided to support Greece in a war against Turkey. This led to the [[Chanak Crisis]] when the Dominions, with the exception of Newfoundland and New Zealand, rejected the British policy and refused to support the proposed war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Kenneth O.|author-link=Kenneth O.

====Domestic crises====
The more conservative wing of the Unionist Party had no intention of introducing reforms, which led to three years of frustrated fighting within the coalition both between the National Liberals and the Unionists and between factions within the Conservatives themselves. Many Conservatives were angered by the granting of independence to the Irish Free State and by [[Edwin Montagu]]'s moves towards [[Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms|limited self-government for India]], while a [[Depression of 1920–21|sharp economic downturn]] and [[Triple Alliance (1914)#The Post-War Triple Alliance|wave of strikes]] in 1921 damaged Lloyd George's credibility. A scandal erupted in 1922 when it became known that Lloyd George had awarded honours and titles, such as baronetcies, to rich businessmen in return for cash in the range of £10,000 and more, via [[Maundy Gregory]]. A major attack on his corruption in the [[House of Lords]] followed, resulting in the [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925]]. Other complaints were that the Cabinet contained too many Scots, too few men from Oxbridge and the great public schools, too many businessmen, and too few gentlemen.&lt;ref name = &quot;CrosbyTo Straighten&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Travis L.| last = Crosby|title=The Unknown David Lloyd George: A Statesman in Conflict|chapter = To Straighten Ragged Edges|year=2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|location = London |isbn=978-1-78076-485-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|330–331}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Kenneth O.|author-link=Kenneth O.

==== Fall from power 1922 ====

The coalition was dealt its final blow in October 1922. The Conservatives felt let down by France over the [[Chanak Crisis]], with Bonar Law telling France, &quot;We cannot act alone as the policeman of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Boyce| author-link = Robert Boyce | title=The Great Interwar Crisis and the Collapse of Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3qHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|page=125|isbn=9780230280762}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative leader, [[Austen Chamberlain]], summoned a [[Carlton Club meeting, 19 October 1922|meeting of Conservative members of parliament]] at the [[Carlton Club]] to discuss their attitude to the Coalition in the forthcoming election. Chamberlain and most Conservative leaders supported Lloyd George; however, the rank and file rejected the coalition. The main attack came from [[Stanley Baldwin]], then President of the Board of Trade, who spoke of Lloyd George as a &quot;dynamic force&quot; who would break the Conservative Party. They sealed Lloyd George's fate on 19 October 1922 by voting in favour of the motion to end the coalition and fight the election &quot;as an independent party, with its own leader and its own programme.&quot; Lloyd George submitted his resignation to the King that afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Ramsden | 1998 | p=244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Peter|title=Lloyd George|year=1975|publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins Ltd|location=London|isbn=0214200493|page=584|chapter=The Man at the Top, 1918-1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal reunion ===
[[File:David Lloyd George - Project Gutenberg eText 15306.jpg|thumb|left | upright | David Lloyd George]]
Throughout the 1920s Lloyd George remained highly visible in politics; predictions that he would return to power were common, but it never happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|author-link=John Campbell (biographer)|title=Lloyd George: The Goat in the Wilderness 1922–1931|year=1977|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|isbn=0224012967|pages=3–11|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; He still controlled a large fund (thought to have been between £1m and £3m, or £50m–£150m at 2015 prices) from his investments in newspaper ownership and from his sale of titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Koss | 1985 | pp=259–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php|title=Measuring Worth – Measures of worth, inflation rates, saving calculator, relative value, worth of a dollar, worth of a pound, purchasing power, gold prices, GDP, history of wages, average wage|website=www.measuringworth.com|access-date=30 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331194822/https://measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php|archive-date=31 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]], he resolved his dispute with Asquith, allowing the Liberals to run a united ticket against [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s policy of protective tariffs. Baldwin both feared and despised Lloyd George, and one of his aims was to keep him out of power. He later claimed that he had adopted tariffs, which cost the Conservatives their majority, out of concern that Lloyd George was about to do so on his return from a tour of North America. Although there was press speculation at the time that Lloyd George would do so (or adopt [[US-style Prohibition]] to appeal to [[Representation of the People Act 1918|newly enfranchised]] women voters), there is no evidence that this was his intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|author-link=John Campbell (biographer)|title=Lloyd George: The Goat in the Wilderness 1922–1931|year=1977|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|isbn=0224012967|pages=47–48|chapter=The Aftermath of Coalition 1922-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asquith and Lloyd George reached agreement on 13 November 1923 and issued a joint Free Trade manifesto, followed by a more general one. Lloyd George agreed to contribute £100,000 (in the event he claimed to have contributed £160,000 including help given to individual candidates; Liberal HQ put the number at £90,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Koss | 1985 | pp=261–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Lloyd George, realising that Liberal defeat was inevitable and keen to take control of the party himself, spent only £60,000.&lt;ref name = RowlandGenuinely&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Peter|title=Lloyd George|year=1975|publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins|location=London|isbn=0214200493|chapter=Genuinely Seeking Work, 1922-1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|631}} At the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]], Baldwin won a clear victory. Despite having a large majority, he appointed the leading coalitionists such as Austen Chamberlain and Lord Birkenhead (and former Liberal [[Winston Churchill]]) to senior cabinet places, to discourage any restoration of the 1916–1922 coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Charmley | 1995 | pp=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal leader ===
[[File:Vera &amp; Chaim Weizmann, Herbert Samuel, Lloyd George, Ethel Snowden, Philip Snowden.jpeg|thumb | 230px | [[Vera Weizmann]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], [[Herbert Samuel]], Lloyd George, [[Ethel Snowden]], and [[Philip Snowden]]]]The disastrous election result in 1924 left the Liberals as a weak third party in British politics, with just over 40 MPs. Although Asquith, who had again lost his seat and was created an [[Earl of Oxford and Asquith|Earl]], remained Liberal leader, Lloyd George was elected chairman of the Liberal MPs by 26 votes to 7. [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] and his followers were still loyal to Asquith (after 1931 Simon would lead a breakaway [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberal Party]], which eventually merged with the Conservatives) whilst [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]] led a separate radical group within the Parliamentary Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Koss | 1985 | pp=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd George was now mainly interested in the reform of land ownership, but had only been permitted to put a brief paragraph about it in the hastily drafted 1924 Liberal manifesto. In the autumn of 1925, despite the hostility of [[Charles Hobhouse]], Runciman and [[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|Alfred Mond]], he began an independent campaign, soon to become &quot;The Land and the Nation&quot; (the ''Green Book'', first of a series of policy papers produced by Lloyd George in the late 1920s). Asquith rebuked him, but was ignored, and they reached an agreement in principle on 2 December, then together they presented Lloyd George's plans to the [[National Liberal Federation]] on 26 February 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Koss | 1985 | pp=267, 272–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Jenkins | 1964 | pp=513–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Shadow Cabinet, including Lloyd George, unequivocally backed Baldwin's handling of the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike]] on 3 May, but Lloyd George then wrote an article for the American press more sympathetic to the strikers, and did not attend the Shadow Cabinet on 10 May, sending his apologies on &quot;policy grounds&quot;. Asquith sent him a public letter (20 May) rebuking him for not attending the meeting to discuss his opinions with colleagues in private. Lloyd George's letter of 10 May had not been published, making it appear that Asquith had fired the first shot, and Lloyd George sent a public reply, moderate in tone (the journalist [[C. P. Scott]] helped him draft it), on 25 May. In late May, the executive of the National Liberal Federation convened to plan the agenda for the following month's conference. 16 were pro Asquith and 8 pro Lloyd George; they planned a motion expressing confidence in Asquith, but another option was also proposed to seek Asquith's opinion first, and also general feeling of regret at having been forced to choose between Asquith and Lloyd George. Asquith then wrote another public letter (1 June) stating that he regarded Lloyd George's behaviour as tantamount to resignation, the same as if a Cabinet Minister had refused to abide by the principle of collective responsibility. Twelve leading Liberals wrote in Asquith's support to ''The Times'' (1 June); however, Lloyd George had more support in the wider party than among the grandees: the London Liberal Candidates' Association (3 June) defied its officers and expressed its dismay at the split, effectively supporting Lloyd George, and on 8 June the Liberal MPs voted 20:10 urging a reconciliation. Asquith had planned to launch a fightback at the National Liberal Federation in Weston-Super-Mare, but on 12 June, five days before the conference was due to start, he suffered a stroke which put him out of action for three months. Lloyd George was given a rapturous welcome. Asquith resigned as party leader in October, dying in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Koss | 1985 | pp=276–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Jenkins | 1964 | pp=514–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Liberal leader at last, Lloyd George used his fund to finance candidates and put forward innovative ideas for public works to reduce unemployment, detailed in works such as ''[[Britain's Industrial Future]]'' (known as the ''Yellow Book''), and ''We Can Conquer Unemployment'' (known as the ''Orange Book''). [[Charles Masterman]], a member of the commission which prepared ''Britain's Industrial Future'', wrote: &quot;When Lloyd George came back to the party, ideas came back to the party&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MastermanLabour&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Masterman|first=Lucy|author-link=Lucy Masterman|title=C. F. G. Masterman A Biography|year=1968|publisher=Frank Cass and Co Ltd|location=London|chapter=13: 1924. Labour Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345–346}} Lloyd George was helped by [[John Maynard Keynes]] to write ''We Can Conquer Unemployment'', setting out economic policies to solve unemployment. In 1927, Lloyd George gave £300,000 and an annual grant of between £30,000 and £40,000 for the operations of the Liberal headquarters. He also gave £2,000 per annum to the parliamentary party until 1931.&lt;ref name = &quot;JonesInOppo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Jones (civil servant)|title=Lloyd George|year=1951|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|chapter=VII: In Opposition 1923–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223–224}}&lt;ref name = RowlandGenuinely/&gt;{{rp|630}} Even with the money the results at the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] were disappointing. The Liberals increased their support only to 60 or so seats, while Labour became the largest party for the first time. Once again, the Liberals ended up supporting a minority Labour government. In 1929, Lloyd George became [[Father of the House (United Kingdom)|Father of the House]] (longest-serving member of the Commons), an honorific position without power.

=== Marginalised ===
In 1931, an illness prevented his joining the [[UK National Government|National Government]] when it was formed. Later when the National Government called a General Election he tried to pull the Liberal Party out of it but succeeded in taking only a few followers, most of whom were related to him; the main Liberal Party remained in the coalition for a year longer, under the leadership of [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]]. By the 1930s Lloyd George was on the margins of British politics, although still intermittently in the public eye and publishing his ''War Memoirs''. Lloyd George was President of the London Welsh Trust, which runs the [[London Welsh Centre]], Gray's Inn Road, from 1934 until 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.londonwelsh.org/archives/1796 | title=Our Former Presidents: London Welsh Centre | publisher=[[London Welsh Centre]] | access-date=4 February 2011 | work=[[London Welsh Centre]] website | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025944/http://www.londonwelsh.org/archives/1796 | archive-date=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lloyd George's &quot;New Deal&quot; ===
[[File:LloydGeorgeEn1932.jpeg|thumb|Lloyd George in 1932]]
In January 1935 Lloyd George announced a programme of economic reform, called &quot;Lloyd George's New Deal&quot; after the American [[New Deal]]. This [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynesian]] economic programme was essentially the same as that of 1929. MacDonald requested that he put his case before the Cabinet. In March, Lloyd George submitted a 100-page memorandum (published as ''Organizing Prosperity: A Scheme of National Reconstruction'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd George|first=David|title=Organizing Prosperity: A Scheme of National Reconstruction|year=1935|publisher=Ivor Nicholson and Watson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was cross-examined between April and June in ten meetings of the Cabinet's sub-committee; however, the programme did not find favour; two-thirds of Conservative MPs were against Lloyd George joining the National government, and some Cabinet members would have resigned if he had joined.&lt;ref name = &quot;JonesInOppo&quot;/&gt;{{rp|238–239}}

=== Appeasement of Germany ===

=== Final years ===
In the last important parliamentary intervention of his career, which occurred during the crucial [[Norway Debate]] of May 1940, Lloyd George made a powerful speech that helped to undermine Chamberlain as Prime Minister and to pave the way for the ascendancy of Churchill.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Jenkins | 2001 | p=580}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill offered Lloyd George the agriculture portfolio in his Cabinet, initially subject to Chamberlain's approval, but this condition and, once Chamberlain had withdrawn his opposition, Lloyd George's unwillingness to sit alongside Chamberlain, led him to refuse.&lt;ref name = &quot;JonesInOppo&quot;/&gt;{{rp|255}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Peter|title=Lloyd George|year=1975|publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins|location=London|isbn=0214200493|quotation = As we approached No 10 LG said &quot;I won't go in with Neville&quot;|pages=773–776|chapter=16: The Realist,1939-1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd George also thought that Britain's chances in the war were dim, and he remarked to his secretary: &quot;I shall wait until Winston is bust.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | A. J. Sylvester | 1975 | p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to the [[Hastings Russell, 12th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] in September 1940, during the [[Battle of Britain]], advocating a negotiated peace with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Reynolds | 2006 | p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Grave of David Lloyd George, Llanystumdwy, Gwynedd (geograph 6447819).jpg|right|thumb | 200px | [[Grave of David Lloyd George]], Llanystumdwy]]
A pessimistic speech by Lloyd George on 7 May 1941 led Churchill to compare him with [[Philippe Pétain]]. On 11 June 1942, he made his last speech in the House of Commons, and he cast his last vote in the Commons on 18 February 1943 as one of the 121 MPs (97 Labour) condemning the Government for its failure to back the [[Beveridge Report]]. Fittingly, his final vote was in defence of the welfare state which he had helped to create.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Addison | 1994 | pp=224–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to attend Castle Street Baptist Chapel in London, and to preside over the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] at its Thursday session each summer. In September 1944 he and Frances left his home, [[Bron-y-de]] in [[Churt]], for [[Tŷ Newydd]], a farm near his boyhood home in Llanystumdwy. He was now weakening rapidly and his voice failing. He was still an MP but, concerned about his health (he felt physically unable to campaign) and the wartime social changes in the constituency, he feared Carnarvon Boroughs might go Conservative at the next election.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rintala1985&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rintala|first=Marvin|date=Summer 1985|title=Renamed Roses: Lloyd George, Churchill, and the House of Lords|journal=[[Biography (journal)|Biography]]|publisher = University of Hawai'i Press|volume=8|issue=3|pages=248–264|jstor=23539091|doi=10.1353/bio.2010.0448|s2cid=159908334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wishing, as the last surviving author of the Versailles settlement, to have an official platform to speak on any peace settlement he accepted a peerage.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rintala1985&quot;/&gt; It was announced in the [[1945 New Year Honours]] that Lloyd George would be made an earl, which he was as [[Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor]], and Viscount Gwynedd, of Dwyfor in the [[Historic counties of Wales|County]] of [[Caernarvonshire]] on 12 February 1945; however, he did not live long enough to take his seat in the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wrigley1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wrigley|first=Chris|title=Lloyd George|series=Historical Association Studies|year=1992|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford|isbn=0631166084|page=146|chapter=Lloyd George and the Liberal Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
Lloyd George died of cancer at the age of 82 on 26 March 1945, with his wife Frances and his daughter Megan at his bedside. Four days later, on [[Good Friday]], he was buried beside the [[Afon Dwyfor|river Dwyfor]] in [[Llanystumdwy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/961784fa-ec00-368b-ae06-e84a76c88803|title=David Lloyd George remembered|date=17 January 2013|website=Wales|language=en-GB|access-date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A boulder marks the grave; there is no inscription; however a [[Grave of David Lloyd George|monument]] designed by the architect Sir [[Clough Williams-Ellis]] was subsequently erected around the grave,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00qvnkz|title=Clough Williams-Ellis on Lloyd-George's memorial|date=5 April 2012|publisher=BBC Two|access-date=10 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; bearing an [[englyn]] (strict-metre stanza) engraved on slate in his memory composed by his nephew Dr [[W. R. P. George]]. Nearby stands the [[Lloyd George Museum]], also designed by Williams-Ellis and opened in 1963.

==Assessment==
Lloyd George has often been [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom|ranked highly among modern British prime ministers]], but his legacy remains complicated and controversial. Scholars have praised his welfare reforms and his efforts to mobilise and lead Britain to victory during the First World War, but he has also been criticised for adopting a &quot;[[Presidential system|presidential]]&quot; style of leadership, for distrusting his own commanders during the war, and for his strategic failures and involvement in various scandals. His legacies over Ireland and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] are also controversial. In the post-war period he arguably alienated many of the workers he had earlier championed, helping to swell Labour's popular support at the Liberals' expense (not helped by his conflicts with Asquithian Liberals after 1916).

Historian [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] in ''The Oxford Companion to British History'' argues that:&lt;blockquote&gt;[Lloyd George] made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-cent. statesman. He laid the foundations of what later became the welfare state, and put a progressive income tax system at the centre of government finance. He also left his mark on the system of government by enlarging the scope of the prime minister's role. He was acclaimed, not without reason, as the 'Man Who Won the War'....he was blamed by many Liberals for destroying their party in 1918, hated in the Labour movement for his handling of industrial issues after 1918, and disparaged by Conservatives for his radicalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Pugh 2002&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb | Pugh | 2009|page=585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[George Riddell, 1st Baron Riddell]], a wealthy newspaper publisher, was a close confidant and financial supporter of Lloyd George from 1908 to 1922, and Riddell's revealing diary is a valuable source for the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Bentley Brinkerhoff|title=Lloyd George: A Political Life: Organizer of Victory 1912–1916|year=1992|publisher=B. T. Batsford Ltd|location=London|isbn=0713457279|page=14|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Lloyd George's first year as prime minister, in summer 1917, Riddell assessed his personality:&lt;blockquote&gt;His energy, capacity for work, and power of recuperation are remarkable. He has an extraordinary memory, imagination, and the art of getting at the root of a matter....He is not afraid of responsibility, and has no respect for tradition or convention. He is always ready to examine, scrap or revise established theories and practices.  These qualities give him unlimited confidence in himself.... He is one of the craftiest of men, and his extraordinary charm of manner not only wins him friends, but does much to soften the asperities of his opponents and enemies. He is full of humour and a born actor....He has an instinctive power of divining the thoughts and intentions of people with whom he is conversing...His chief defects are: (1) Lack of appreciation of existing institutions, organisations, and stolid, dull people...their ways are not his ways and their methods are not his methods. (2) Fondness for a grandiose scheme in preference to an attempt to improve existing machinery. (3) Disregard of difficulties in carrying out big projects...he is not a man of detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grigg|first=John|author-link=John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham|title=Lloyd George: War Leader 1916–1918|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0140284273|pages=220–221|chapter=Lloyd George's Boswell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, historian John Shepherd wrote in ''[[History Today]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;
In any poll of modern historians Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George would emerge as the two most renowned prime ministers during the past century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shepherd|first= John|year= 2007 |title= Book Review: Lloyd George and Churchill: rivals for greatness|journal= [[History Today]]| volume = 57 | issue = 6 |location= London|pages= 65–66|issn= 0018-2753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
=== Margaret and children ===
[[File:TNA COPY1-560-129 David and Megan Lloyd George.jpg|thumb|Lloyd George with his daughter Megan in 1911]]
He had five children by his first wife, Margaret: [[Richard Lloyd George|Richard]] (1889–1968), Mair (1890–1907, who died during an [[appendectomy]]), Olwen (1892–1990), [[Gwilym Lloyd George|Gwilym]] (1894–1967) and [[Megan Lloyd George|Megan]] (1902–1966). Despite his long-term affair with Frances Stevenson, he remained married to Margaret, and remained fond of her until her death&lt;ref name=&quot;LongfordGreater&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Longford|first=Ruth|title=Frances, Countess Lloyd George: More than a Mistress|year=1996|publisher=Gracewing|isbn=0852443242|chapter=A Greater Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} on 20 January 1941; Lloyd George was deeply upset by the fact that bad weather prevented him from being with her when she died.

Gwilym and Megan both followed him into politics, and were elected members of parliament. They were politically faithful to their father throughout his life, but after 1945 each drifted away from the Liberal Party, Gwilym finishing his career as a Conservative [[Home Secretary]] and Megan becoming a Labour MP in 1957.

=== Frances ===
Lloyd George met [[Frances Stevenson]] in 1910; she worked for him first as a teacher for Megan in 1911;&lt;ref name=&quot;LongfordGreater&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1}} she became his secretary and, from early 1913, his long-term mistress.&lt;ref name=&quot;LongfordGreater&quot;/&gt;{{rp|11–12}} Lloyd George may have been the father of Stevenson's daughter Jennifer (1929–2012), born long before they wed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Longford | first=Jennifer | title=Memories of David Lloyd George | url=http://lloydgeorgesociety.org.uk/news/000006/memories_of_david_lloyd_george__by_jennifer_longford.html | date=10 July 2007 | website=lloydgeorgesociety.org.uk | access-date=5 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is more likely that she was the daughter of [[Thomas F. Tweed|Thomas Tweed]], with whom Stevenson had had an affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hague|first=Ffion|author-link = Ffion Hague|title=The Pain and the Privilege: The Women in Lloyd George's Life|year=2008|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=9780007219490|page=461|chapter=New Loves}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the disapproval of his children he finally married Frances in October 1943; he was aged 80 at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;LongfordAWar&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Longford|first=Ruth|title=Frances, Countess Lloyd George: More than a Mistress|year=1996|publisher=Gracewing|isbn=0852443242|chapter=A War on several fronts}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154–156}}

Frances was the first Countess Lloyd-George, and is now largely remembered for her diaries, which dealt with the great issues, and statesmen, of Lloyd George's heyday. A volume of their letters, ''My Darling Pussy'', has also been published; Lloyd George's nickname for Frances referred to her gentle personality.&lt;ref name=&quot;LongfordGreater&quot;/&gt;{{rp|12}}

=== Descendants ===
The Canadian historian [[Margaret MacMillan]], who detailed Lloyd George's role at the 1919 Peace Conference in her book, ''[[Peacemakers: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War|Peacemakers]]'', is his great-granddaughter. The British television historian and presenter [[Dan Snow]] is a great-great-grandson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/dan-snow-history-boy-876350.html | title=Dan Snow: History boy – Profiles – People – The Independent | date=26 July 2008 | work=[[The Independent]] | access-date=2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other descendants include his late grandson [[Owen Lloyd George, 3rd Earl Lloyd George of Dwyfor|Owen, 3rd Earl Lloyd George]].

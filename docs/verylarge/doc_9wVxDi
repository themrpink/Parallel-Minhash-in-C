'''Hybris''', also known as Snow White, Vecna.22528, and Full Moon, is a computer worm believed to be written by Brazilian virus writer [[Vecna (virus writer)|Vecna]], member of the [[computer virus]] writing group [[29A]]. It first appeared in September 2000 and became more common in January 2001.

Hybris typically comes from an email that appears to be from hahaha@sexyfun.net. Malicious &quot;plug-ins&quot; enhanced Hybris's functionality to include various other e-mail types. Other plugin functionalities include a spinning &quot;wheel of hypnosis.&quot;

The name ''Hybris'' originates from the text within the virus: &quot;HYBRIS&quot; &quot;(c) Vecna&quot;.

[[File:Edit de Nantes Avril 1598.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Edict of Nantes]]
{{Campaignbox French Wars of Religion}}

The '''Edict of Nantes''' ([[French language|French]]: ''édit de Nantes''), signed in April 1598 by [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV of France]], granted the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestants]] of [[France]]  (also known as [[Huguenot]]s) substantial rights in the nation, which was still considered essentially [[Catholicism|Catholic]] at the time. In the [[edict]], Henry aimed primarily to promote civil unity.{{efn|In 1898, the tricentennial celebrated the edict as the foundation of the coming Age of Toleration; the 1998 anniversary, by contrast, was commemorated with a book of essays under the title, ''Coexister dans l'intolérance'' (Michel Grandjean and Bernard Roussel, editors, Geneva, 1998).}} The edict separated civil from [[religious]] unity, treated some Protestants for the first time as more than mere [[Schism (religion)|schismatics]] and [[Heresy|heretics]], and opened a path for [[secularism]] and tolerance. In offering general [[freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their [[civil rights]], including the right to work in any field or for the state and to bring grievances directly to the [[King of France|king]]. It marked the end of the [[French Wars of Religion|religious wars]] that had afflicted France during the second half of the 16th century.

The [[Edict of St. Germain]], promulgated 36 years before by [[Catherine de Médici]], had granted limited tolerance to Huguenots but was overtaken by events, as it was not formally registered until after the [[Massacre of Vassy]] on 1 March 1562, which triggered the first of the [[French Wars of Religion]].

The later [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], which revoked the Edict of Nantes in October 1685, was promulgated by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the grandson of Henry IV. It drove an exodus of Protestants and increased the hostility of Protestant nations bordering France.

== Overview ==
The Edict aimed primarily to end the long-running [[French Wars of Religion]].{{efn|A detailed chronological account of the negotiations that led to the Edict's promulgation has been offered by Janine Garrisson, ''L'Édit de Nantes: Chronique d'une paix attendue'' (Paris: Fayard) 1998.}} Henry IV also had personal reasons for supporting the Edict. Prior to assuming the throne in 1589 he had espoused Protestantism, and he remained sympathetic to the Protestant cause: he had converted to Catholicism in 1593 only in order to secure his position as king, supposedly saying &quot;Paris is well worth a Mass&quot;. The Edict succeeded in restoring peace and internal unity to France, though it pleased neither party: Catholics rejected the apparent recognition of Protestantism as a permanent element in French society and still hoped to enforce religious uniformity, while Protestants aspired to full parity with Catholics which it did not provide. &quot;Toleration in France was a royal notion, and the religious settlement was dependent upon the continued support of the crown.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothrock17&quot;&gt;George A. Rothrock, Jr., &quot;Some Aspects of Early Bourbon Policy toward the Huguenots&quot; ''Church History'' '''29'''.1 (March 1960:17–24) p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Re-establishing royal authority in France required internal peace, based on limited toleration enforced by the crown. Since royal troops could not be everywhere, Huguenots needed to be granted strictly circumscribed possibilities of self-defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothrock17&quot; /&gt;

==The Edict==
[[Image:Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry IV of France]] by [[Frans Pourbus the younger]].]]
The Edict of Nantes that Henry IV signed comprised four basic texts, including a principal text made up of 92 articles and largely based on unsuccessful peace treaties signed during the recent wars. The Edict also included 56 &quot;particular&quot; (secret) articles dealing with Protestant rights and obligations. For example, the French state guaranteed protection of French Protestants travelling abroad from the [[Inquisition]]. &quot;This crucifies me,&quot; protested [[Pope Clement VIII]], upon hearing of the Edict. The final two parts consisted of ''brevets'' ([[letters patent]]) which contained the military clauses and pastoral clauses. These two brevets were withdrawn in 1629 by [[Louis XIII]], following a final religious civil war.

The two [[letters patent]]&lt;ref&gt;Texts published in [[Élie Benoist|Benoist]] 1693 I:62–98 (noted by Rothrock).&lt;/ref&gt; supplementing the Edict granted the Protestants&lt;!--fifty or one hundred?--&gt; safe havens (''places de sûreté''), which were military strongholds such as [[La Rochelle]], in support of which the king paid 180,000 [[écu]]s a year, along with a further 150 emergency forts (''places de refuge''), to be maintained at the Huguenots' own expense. Such an act of toleration was unusual in Western Europe,{{efn|For Eastern Europe, see [[Mehmed II#Mehmed II's Firman on the Freedom of the Bosnian Franciscans|Mehmed II's Firman on the Freedom of the Bosnian Franciscans]] or the [[Warsaw Confederation]].}} where standard practice forced subjects to follow the religion of their ruler—the application of the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''.

While it granted certain privileges to Huguenots, the edict upheld Catholicism's position as the established religion of France. Protestants gained no exemption from paying the [[tithe]]{{efn|The King engaged to support the Protestant ministers in part recompense.}} and had to respect [[feast day|Catholic holiday]]s and restrictions regarding marriage. The authorities limited Protestant freedom of worship to specified geographic areas. The Edict dealt only with Protestant and Catholic coexistence; it made no mention of [[Jew]]s, or of [[Muslim]]s, who were offered temporary asylum in France when the [[Moriscos]] were being expelled from Spain.{{efn|The ''ordonnance'' of 22 February 1610 stipulated that the emigrés settle north of the [[Dordogne]] (safely away from the manipulations of Spanish agents) and that they embrace the Catholic faith; those who did not wish to do so were granted right of passage to French ports on the Mediterranean, to take ship for [[Barbary]].&lt;ref&gt;L. P. Harvey, ''Muslims in Spain, 1500 to 1614'', 2005:318&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the ''ordonnance'' was published Henri IV had been assassinated.}}

The original Act which promulgated the Edict has disappeared. The ''[[Archives Nationales (France)|Archives Nationales]]'' in Paris preserves only the text of a shorter document modified by concessions extracted from the King by the clergy and the [[Parlement of Paris]], which delayed ten months before finally signing and setting seals to the document in 1599. A copy of the first edict, sent for safekeeping to Protestant [[Geneva]], survives. The provincial [[parlement]]s resisted in their turn; the most recalcitrant, the [[parlement of Rouen]], did not unreservedly register the Edict until 1609.&lt;ref&gt;Rothrock 1960:23 note 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the signing is uncertain. The Edict itself states merely that it is &quot;given at [[Nantes]], in the month of April, in the year of Our Lord one thousand five hundred and ninety-eight&quot;. By the late 19th century the Catholic tradition&lt;ref&gt;Reported in Baedeker, ''Northern France'', 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; cited the signing in the &quot;Maison des Tourelles&quot;, home of prosperous Spanish trader André Ruiz; it was destroyed by bombing in World War II.

==Revocation==
{{main|Edict of Fontainebleau}}
[[Image:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|Louis XIV, by [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]]]
The Edict remained unaltered in effect, registered by the parliaments as &quot;fundamental and irrevocable law,&quot; with the exception of the ''brevets,'' which had been granted for a period of eight years, and were renewed by Henry in 1606 and in 1611 by [[Marie de' Medici|Marie de Médecis]], who confirmed the Edict within a week of the assassination of Henry, stilling Protestant fears of another [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]]. The subsidies had been reduced by degrees, as Henry gained more control of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;A point made in Rothrock 1960:19.&lt;/ref&gt; By the peace of Montpellier in 1622, concluding a Huguenot revolt in Languedoc, the fortified Protestant towns were reduced to two, [[La Rochelle]] and [[Montauban]]. The ''brevets'' were entirely withdrawn in 1629, by [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], following the [[Siege of La Rochelle]], in which [[Cardinal Richelieu]] blockaded the city for fourteen months.

During the remainder of Louis XIII's reign, and especially during the minority of Louis XIV, the implementation of the Edict varied year by year, voiced in declarations and orders, and in case decisions in the Council, fluctuating according to the tides of domestic politics and the relations of France with powers abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Kleinman, &quot;Changing Interpretations of the Edict of Nantes: The Administrative Aspect, 1643–1661&quot; ''French Historical Studies'' '''10'''.4 (Autumn 1978:541–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1685, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the grandson of Henry IV, renounced the Edict and declared Protestantism illegal with the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]]. This act, commonly called the '''revocation of the Edict of Nantes'',' had very damaging results for France. While the wars of religion did not re-ignite, intense persecution of Protestants took place.  All Protestant ministers were given two weeks to leave the country unless they converted to Catholicism and all other Protestants were prohibited from leaving the country.  In spite of the prohibition, the renewed persecution - including many examples of torture - caused as many as 400,000 to flee France at risk of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1685revocation.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=www.fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = [[Mentor]] |year = 1972 |location = New York City |pages =[https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoft02samu/page/220 220] |url =https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoft02samu|url-access = registration |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most moved to [[Great Britain]], [[Prussia]], the [[Dutch Republic]], [[Switzerland]], [[Huguenots in South Africa|South Africa]] and the [[New France|new French colonies]] and the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America.&lt;ref&gt;See [[History of the French in Louisville]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some even moved to Denmark, where the city of Fredericia, laid waste after the Swedish conquest in 1656, needed new settlers and a specific clause in the  city ordinance allowed other than Lutheran-Protestants to live in the city.&lt;ref&gt;City ordinance of 1682-03-11&lt;/ref&gt; This exodus deprived France of many of its most skilled and industrious individuals, some of whom thenceforward aided France's rivals in the Netherlands and in England. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes also further damaged the perception of Louis XIV abroad, making the Protestant nations bordering France even more hostile to his regime. Upon the revocation of the edict, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] issued the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which encouraged Protestants to come to [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].

Freedom to worship and civil rights for non-Catholics in France were not restored until the signing of the [[Edict of Versailles]], also known as the [[Edict of Tolerance]], by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] 102 years later, on 7 November 1787. This edict was enacted by [[parlement]] two months later, less than two years before the end of the [[Ancien Régime]] and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]] would fully eliminate religious discrimination in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals, ''Edict of Versailles (1787)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714094231/http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_(1787).html |date=2012-07-14 }}, downloaded 29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literal translation==
The principal and most salient provisions of Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, as promulgated at Nantes in Brittany probably on 30 April 1598, include:&lt;ref&gt;History Guide, [http://historyguide.org/earlymod/nantes.html The Edict of Nantes (1598)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Henri, by the grace of God king of France and of Navarre, to all to whom these presents come, greeting:

Among the infinite benefits which it has pleased God to heap upon us, the most signal and precious is his granting us the strength and ability to withstand the fearful disorders and troubles which prevailed on our advent in this kingdom.  The realm was so torn by innumerable factions and sects that the most legitimate of all the parties was fewest in numbers.  God has given us strength to stand out against this storm; we have finally surmounted the waves and made our port of safety,—peace for our state.  For which his be the glory all in all, and ours a free recognition of his grace in making use of our instrumentality in the good work....  We implore and await from the Divine Goodness the same protection and favor which he has ever granted to this kingdom from the beginning....

We have, by this perpetual and irrevocable edict, established and proclaimed and do establish and proclaim:

I.  First, that the recollection of everything done by one party or the other between March, 1585, and our accession to the crown, and during all the preceding period of troubles, remain obliterated and forgotten, as if no such things had ever happened....

III.  We ordain that the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion shall be restored and reëstablished in all places and localities of this our kingdom and countries subject to our sway, where the exercise of the same has been interrupted, in order that it may be peaceably and freely exercised, without any trouble or hindrance; forbidding very expressly all persons, of whatsoever estate, quality, or condition, from troubling, molesting, or disturbing ecclesiastics in the celebration of divine service, in the enjoyment or collection of tithes, fruits, or revenues of their benefices, and all other rights and dues belonging to them; and that all those who during the troubles have taken possession of churches, houses, goods or revenues, belonging to the said ecclesiastics, shall surrender to them entire possession and peaceable enjoyment of such rights, liberties, and sureties as they had before they were deprived of them....

VI.  And in order to leave no occasion for troubles or differences between our subjects, we have permitted, and herewith permit, those of the said religion called Reformed to live and abide in all the cities and places of this our kingdom and countries of our sway, without being annoyed, molested, or compelled to do anything in the matter of religion contrary to their consciences, ...  upon condition that they comport themselves in other respects according to that which is contained in this our present edict.

VII.  It is permitted to all lords, gentlemen, and other persons making profession of the said religion called Reformed, holding the right of high justice [or a certain feudal tenure], to exercise the said religion in their houses....

IX.  We also permit those of the said religion to make and continue the exercise of the same in all villages and places of our dominion where it was established by them and publicly enjoyed several and divers times in the year 1597, up to the end of the month of August, notwithstanding all decrees and judgments to the contrary....

XIII.  We very expressly forbid to all those of the said religion its exercise, either in respect to ministry, regulation, discipline, or the public instruction of children, or otherwise, in this our kingdom and lands of our dominion, otherwise than in the places permitted and granted by the present edict.

XIV.  It is forbidden as well to perform any function of the said religion in our court or retinue, or in our lands and territories beyond the mountains, or in our city of Paris, or within five leagues of the said city....

XVIII.  We also forbid all our subjects, of whatever quality and condition, from carrying off by force or persuasion, against the will of their parents, the children of the said religion, in order to cause them to be baptized or confirmed in the Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church; and the same is forbidden to those of the said religion called Reformed, upon penalty of being punished with especial severity....

XXI.  Books concerning the said religion called Reformed may not be printed and publicly sold, except in cities and places where the public exercise of the said religion is permitted.

XXII.  We ordain that there shall be no difference or distinction made in respect to the said religion, in receiving pupils to be instructed in universities, colleges, and schools; nor in receiving the sick and poor into hospitals, retreats, and public charities.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Leishmania''''' {{IPAc-en|l|iː|ʃ|ˈ|m|eɪ|n|i|ə}} is a [[genus]] of [[trypanosomes]] that are responsible for the disease [[leishmaniasis]].&lt;ref name=Sherris&gt;{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | pages = 749–54 | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MylerP&gt;{{cite book | author = Myler P; Fasel N (editors) | title = Leishmania: After The Genome | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008  | isbn =  978-1-904455-28-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26616453&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ansari MY, Equbal A, Dikhit MR, Mansuri R, Rana S, Ali V, Sahoo GC, Das P | title = Establishment of Correlation between In-Silico &amp;In-Vitro Test Analysis against Leishmania HGPRT to inhibitors | journal = International Journal of Biological Macromolecules | date = Nov 2015  | pmid = 26616453 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.11.051 | volume=83 | pages=78–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are spread by [[Phlebotominae|sandflies]] of the genus ''[[Phlebotomus]]'' in the [[Old World]], and of the genus ''[[Lutzomyia]]'' in the [[New World]]. At least 93 sandfly species are proven or probable vectors worldwide.&lt;ref name=WHO2010&gt;WHO (2010) Annual report. Geneva&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary hosts are [[vertebrate]]s; ''Leishmania'' commonly infects [[hyrax]]es, [[canid]]s, [[rodent]]s, and [[human]]s.

==History==
The first written reference to the conspicuous symptoms of [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]] surfaced in the [[Paleotropics]] within [[oriental]] texts dating back to the 7th century BC (allegedly transcribed from sources several hundred years older, between 1500 and 2000 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/CMR.15.4.595-612.2002 |pmid=12364371 |pmc=126866 |title=History of Human Parasitology |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=595–612 |year=2002 |last1=Cox |first1=F. E. G }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Due to its broad and persistent prevalence throughout antiquity as a mysterious disease of diverse symptomatic outcomes, leishmaniasis has been dubbed with various names ranging from &quot;white leprosy&quot; to &quot;[[black fever]]&quot;. Some of these names suggest links to negative cultural beliefs or mythology, which still feed into the social stigmatization of leishmaniasis today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Yanik|first1 = M.|display-authors = etal |year = 2004|title = The psychological impact of cutaneous leishmaniasis|journal = Clin Exp Dermatol|volume = 29|issue = 5|pages = 464–467| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2230.2004.01605.x|pmid = 15347324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of an ancient [[genus]] of the ''Leishmania'' parasite, [[Paleoleishmania]], have been detected in [[fossilized]] [[sand flies]] dating back to the early [[Cretaceous]] period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Poinar|first1 = G|year = 2008|title = Lutzomyia adiketis sp. n. (Diptera: Phlebotomidae), a vector of Paleoleishmania neotropicum sp. n. (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in Dominican amber|journal = Parasit Vectors|volume = 1|issue = 1|page = 2|doi=10.1186/1756-3305-1-22|pmid=18627624|pmc=2491605}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the causative agent for the disease was only discovered in 1901 as a concurrent finding by [[William Boog Leishman]] and [[Charles Donovan]]. They independently visualised microscopic single-celled parasites (later called Leishman-Donovan bodies) living within the cells of infected human organs. The parasitic genus would later be classed as [[trypanosomatid]] [[protozoans]] under the [[phylogenetic]] designation, ''[[Leishmania donovani]]''. Several species have since been classified and grouped under two major subgenera i.e. ''Leishmania Viannia'' (generally located in the [[Neotropics]])  or ''Leishmania Leishmania'' (generally located in the [[Paleotropics]], with the major exception of the ''[[Leishmania mexicana|L. mexicana]]'' subgroup).

==Epidemiology==
''Leishmania'' currently affects 6 million people in 98 countries. About 0.9-1.6 million new cases occur each year, and 21 species are known to cause disease in humans.

==Structure==
''Leishmania'' species are [[protist|unicellular eukaryote]]s having a well-defined [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other cell organelles including [[kinetoplast]]s and [[flagella]]. Depending on the stage of their life cycle, they exist in two structural variants, as:&lt;ref name=dna&gt;{{cite web|title=Morphology and Life Cycle|url=http://dna.kdna.ucla.edu/parasite_course-old/leish_files/subchapters/morphology%20and%20life%20cycle.htm|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pulvertaft|first=RJ|author2=Hoyle, GF |title=Stages in the life-cycle of Leishmania donovani.|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=1960|volume=54|issue=2|pages=191–6|doi=10.1016/0035-9203(60)90057-2|pmid=14435316}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
#The '''amastigote''' form is found in the mononuclear phagocytes and circulatory systems of humans. It is an intracellular and nonmotile form, being devoid of external flagella. The short flagellum is embedded at the anterior end without projecting out. It is oval in shape, and measures 3–6&amp;nbsp;µm in length and 1–3&amp;nbsp;µm in breadth. The kinetoplast and basal body lie towards the anterior end.
#The '''promastigote''' form is found in the [[alimentary tract]] of sandflies. It is an extracellular and motile form. It is considerably larger and highly elongated, measuring 15-30&amp;nbsp;µm in length and 5&amp;nbsp;µm in width. It is spindle-shaped, tapering at both ends. A long flagellum (about the body length) is projected externally at the anterior end. The nucleus lies at the centre, and in front of it are the kinetoplast and the basal body.

Hybridization may be important in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not increasing the number of sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new [[Eukaryote hybrid genome|hybrid genome]] can remain stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Rieseberg, Loren H. | title=Hybrid Origins of Plant Species | journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | date=1997 | volume=28 |pages=359–389 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.28.1.359 | citeseerx=10.1.1.718.9871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[hybrid zone]]s are known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are continually produced in great numbers. These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems for studying the mechanisms of speciation. Recently DNA analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in the [[North West Territories]] confirmed the existence of naturally-occurring and fertile [[grizzly–polar bear hybrid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hybrid bear shot dead in Canada |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4766217.stm |work=BBC News |date=13 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid vigour===
[[File:Salvia jurisicii x nutans - Flickr - peganum.jpg|thumb|[[Heterosis|Hybrid vigour]]: ''Salvia jurisicii x nutans'' hybrids (top centre, with flowers) are taller than their parents ''[[Salvia jurisicii]]'' (centre tray) or ''[[Salvia nutans]]'' (top left).]]
{{Main|Heterosis}}

Hybridization between reproductively isolated species often results in hybrid offspring with lower fitness than either parental. However, hybrids are not, as might be expected, always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger or perform better than either parental lineage or variety, a phenomenon called [[heterosis|heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage]]. This is most common with plant hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Evaluating the utility of Arabidopsis thaliana as a model for understanding heterosis in hybrid crops |journal=Euphytica |volume=156 |issue=1–2 |date=July 2007 |doi=10.1007/s10681-007-9362-1 |pages=157–171 | last1 = Stokes | first1 = David|s2cid=22964055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Transgressive segregation|transgressive phenotype]] is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Transgressive segregation, adaptation and speciation |journal=Heredity |date=July 1999 |first=Loren H. |last=Rieseberg |pmid=10583537 |author2=Margaret A. Archer |author3=Robert K. Wayne |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=363–372 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6886170|s2cid=2651616 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plant breeding|Plant breeders]] use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid [[maize]] (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. [[Hybrid seed]] dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, C. Wayne |title=Corn: Origin, History, Technology, and Production |publisher=Wiley |date=2004 |page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a hybrid, any trait that falls outside the range of parental variation (and is thus not simply intermediate between its parents) is considered heterotic. ''Positive heterosis'' produces more robust hybrids, they might be stronger or bigger; while the term ''negative heterosis'' refers to weaker or smaller hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McCarthy, Eugene M. |date=2006 |title=Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=17 |isbn=978-0-19-518323-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterosis is common in both animal and plant hybrids. For example, hybrids between a lion and a tigress (&quot;ligers&quot;) are much larger than either of the two progenitors, while &quot;tigons&quot; (lioness × tiger) are smaller. Similarly, the hybrids between the common pheasant (''[[Phasianus colchicus]]'') and domestic fowl (''[[Gallus gallus]]'') are larger than either of their parents, as are those produced between the common pheasant and hen golden pheasant (''[[Chrysolophus pictus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Darwin, Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |year=1868 |title=Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication |volume=II |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurs are absent in hybrids of the former type, although present in both parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spicer, J.

==Human influence==

===Anthropogenic hybridization===

Hybridization is greatly influenced by human impact on the environment,&lt;ref name=A2001&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allendorf |first=Fred W. |author2=Leary, R. F. |author3=Spruell, P. |author4=Wenburg, J. K. |title=The problems with hybrids: setting conservation guidelines |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |date=2001 |volume=16 |issue=11 |pages=613–622|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02290-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; through effects such as [[habitat fragmentation]] and species introductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ehrlich |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Ehrlich |author2=John Holdren |title=Impact of population Growth |journal=Science |date=26 March 1971 |volume=171 |pages=1212–1216 |doi=10.1126/science.171.3977.1212 |issue=3977 |pmid=5545198|bibcode=1971Sci...171.1212E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such impacts make it difficult to [[conservation genetics|conserve the genetics]] of populations undergoing [[introgression|introgressive hybridization]]. Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as [[biological control]], and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vitousek |first=Peter |display-authors=etal |title=Introduced Species: A Significant Component of Human-cause Global Change |journal=New Zealand Journal of Ecology |year=1997 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
[[File:Aquilegia pubescens-formosa hybrid-swarm flowers close.jpg|thumb|Examples of hybrid flowers from [[hybrid swarm]]s of ''[[Aquilegia pubescens]]'' and ''[[Aquilegia formosa]]'']]

There is a kind of continuum with three semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and [[hybrid swarm]]s (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within [[wildlife management]] and habitat management. [[Global warming|Global climate change]] is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.&lt;ref name=A2001/&gt;

Conservationists disagree on when is the proper time to give up on a population that is becoming a hybrid swarm, or to try and save the still existing pure individuals. Once a population becomes a complete mixture, the goal becomes to conserve those hybrids to avoid their loss. Conservationists treat each case on its merits, depending on detecting hybrids within the population. It is nearly impossible to formulate a uniform hybridization policy, because hybridization can occur beneficially when it occurs &quot;naturally&quot;, and when hybrid swarms are the only remaining evidence of prior species, they need to be conserved as well.&lt;ref name=A2001/&gt;

===Genetic mixing and extinction===
{{Main|Genetic pollution}}
{{further|Genetic mixing|Introgression}}

Regionally developed [[ecotype]]s can be threatened with [[extinction]] when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype. This is sometimes called genetic mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mooney |first1=H. A. |last2=Cleland |first2=E. E. |year=2001 |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species |journal=PNAS |volume=98 |issue=10 |pages=5446–5451 |doi=10.1073/pnas.091093398 |pmid=11344292 |pmc=33232|bibcode=2001PNAS...98.5446M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hybridization and introgression, which can happen in natural and hybrid populations, of new genetic material can lead to the replacement of local [[genotypes]] if the hybrids are more [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] and have breeding advantages over the indigenous ecotype or species. These hybridization events can result from the introduction of non-native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing can be especially detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population to such a degree that none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rhymer |first1=J. M. |last2=Simberloff |first2=D. |year=1996 |title=Extinction by Hybridization and Introgression |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=27 |pages=83–109 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.27.1.83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potts, Brad M.; Barbour, Robert C.; Hingston, Andrew B.

===Effect on biodiversity and food security===
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|The [[Green Revolution]] of the 20th century relied on hybridization to create [[high-yielding varieties]], along with increased reliance on inputs of [[fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s, and [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farmer |first=B. H. |year=1986 |title= Perspectives on the 'Green Revolution' in South Asia |journal=Modern Asian Studies |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=175–199 |doi=10.1017/s0026749x00013627}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Biodiversity|Food security}}

In agriculture and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]]'s use of conventional hybridization increased yields by breeding &quot;[[high-yielding varieties]]&quot;. The replacement of locally indigenous breeds, compounded with unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding (genetic mixing), has reduced the gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds resulting in the loss of [[genetic diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html &quot;Genetic Pollution: The Great Genetic Scandal&quot;] Devinder Sharma {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518120050/http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html |date=18 May 2009}}; Bulletin 28&lt;/ref&gt; Since the indigenous breeds are often well-adapted to local extremes in climate and have immunity to local pathogens, this can be a significant genetic erosion of the gene pool for future breeding. Therefore, commercial plant geneticists strive to breed &quot;widely adapted&quot; cultivars to counteract this tendency.&lt;ref&gt;Troyer, A. Forrest.

Plant species hybridize more readily than animal species, and the resulting hybrids are fertile more often. Many plant species are the result of hybridization, combined with [[polyploidy]], which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goulet2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goulet |first1=Benjamin E. |last2=Roda |first2=Federico |last3=Hopkins |first3=Robin |title=Hybridization in Plants: Old Ideas, New Techniques |journal=Plant Physiology |date=2016 |volume=173 |issue=1 |pages=65–78 |doi=10.1104/pp.16.01340 |pmid=27895205 |pmc=5210733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant species that are genetically compatible may not hybridize in nature for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in flowering period, or differences in [[pollinator]]s. Species that are brought together by humans in gardens may hybridize naturally, or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts, such as altered flowering period or artificial pollination. Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that have some of the characteristics of each of the parent species.

Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid is often a result of chromosome number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, which leaves them unable to produce chromosomally-balanced [[gametes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/MCDB2150Fall/notes00/L0033.html|title=University of Colorado Principles of Genetics (MCDB 2150) Lecture 33: Chromosomal changes: Monosomy, Trisomy, Polyploidy, Structural Changes|publisher=[[University of Colorado]]|date=21 November 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014211310/http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/MCDB2150Fall/notes00/L0033.html|archivedate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless, it is an attractive attribute in some fruits.

===In humans===
{{main |Interbreeding between archaic and modern humans}}&lt;!--for image, see that article--&gt;

There is evidence of hybridisation between modern humans and other species of the genus ''[[Homo]]''. In 2010, the [[Neanderthal genome project]] showed that 1–4% of DNA from all people living today, apart from most [[Sub-Saharan African]]s, is of Neanderthal heritage. Analyzing the genomes of 600 Europeans and East Asians found that combining them covered 20% of the Neanderthal genome that is in the modern human population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Vernot | first=B. |author2=Akey, J.

[[File:Minotauros Myron NAMA 1664 n1.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Minotaur]] of ancient [[Greek mythology]] was (in one version of the myth) supposedly the offspring of [[Pasiphaë]] and a white bull.]]

Folk tales and myths sometimes contain mythological hybrids; the [[Minotaur]] was the offspring of a human, [[Pasiphaë]], and a white bull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Minotauros |url=http://www.theoi.com/Ther/Minotauros.html |website=Theoi |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More often, they are composites of the physical attributes of two or more kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion that they are the result of interbreeding, as in the [[centaur]] (man/horse), [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] (goat/lion/snake), [[hippocamp]] (fish/horse), and [[sphinx]] (woman/lion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bestiary |url=http://www.theoi.com/greek-mythology/bestiary.html |website=Theoi |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Testament]] mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid [[giant (mythology)|giants]], the [[Nephilim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8AjDrIkBG4C |title=Traditions of the Bible: A Guide to the Bible As It Was at the Start of the Common Era |author=Kugel, James L. |date=2009 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |page=198|isbn=9780674039766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i8ppE9olz_AC |title=The Bible as it was |author=Kugel, James L. |date=1997 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |page=110|isbn=9780674069411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]] [[Book of Enoch]] describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of [[fallen angel]]s and attractive women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Boyd, Gregory A. |title=God at War: The Bible &amp; Spiritual Conflict |publisher=IVP Academic |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human-animal hybrids]] portray humanity's conflicted or divided nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[James L. Resseguie]], &quot;A Glossary of New Testament Narrative Criticism with Illustrations,&quot; in [https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/10/3/217 ''Religions'', 10 (3: 217)], 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the centaur, which has the face, arms, and trunk of a human with the body of a horse, depicts the unbridled tendencies within humans. The sphinx, which in its Greek form has the face of a woman and the body of a lion with wings, represents the cunning, trickster side of humans. Sophocles' Oedipus narratives highlight this trait when the sphinx of Thebes poses a riddle that appears unsolvable but is solved by Oedipus. The manticore has the head of a human with three rows of shark-like teeth, a body of a lion, and a tail with venomous spines similar to porcupine quills or a scorpion-like tail. The manticore portrays the bestial and vicious nature of humans. In the [[Book of Revelation]], hybrids portray what this world would look like if evil gained the upper hand and reigned uncontested. Specifically, the locusts of Revelation 9 are human-animal hybrids released from the abyss (the demonic underworld) and represent the reverse side of this world. Their destructive nature portrays what this world would be like if God allowed demonic powers to have free, unrestrained reign.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Koester, ''Revelation and the End of All Things'', 2nd ed. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2018), 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''hybrid balance''' is an expression of the degree of electrical symmetry between two [[impedance matching|impedances]] connected to two conjugate sides of a [[hybrid coil]] or [[resistance hybrid]]. It is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]].

==Variants==
===CryptMT===
{{main article|CryptMT}}
[[CryptMT]] is a [[stream cipher]] and [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]] which uses Mersenne Twister internally.&lt;ref name=&quot;eSTREAM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cryptographic Mersenne Twister and Fubuki Stream/Block Cipher|last1=Matsumoto|first1=Makoto|last2=Nishimura|first2=Takuji|last3=Hagita|first3=Mariko|last4=Saito|first4=Mutsuo|year=2005|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/165.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by Matsumoto and Nishimura alongside Mariko Hagita and Mutsuo Saito. It has been submitted to the [[eSTREAM]] project of the [[eCRYPT]] network.&lt;ref name=&quot;eSTREAM&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/cryptmtfubuki.html |title=CryptMt and Fubuki |publisher=[[eCRYPT]] |access-date=2017-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Mersenne Twister or its other derivatives, CryptMT is [[software patent|patented]].

===MTGP===
MTGP is a variant of Mersenne Twister optimised for [[graphics processing unit]]s published by Mutsuo Saito and Makoto Matsumoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1005.4973v3 |title= Variants of Mersenne Twister Suitable for Graphic Processors|class= cs.MS|year= 2010|author1= Mutsuo Saito |author2= Makoto Matsumoto }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic linear recurrence operations are extended from MT and parameters are chosen to allow many threads to compute the recursion in parallel, while sharing their state space to reduce memory load.  The paper claims improved [[equidistribution]] over MT and performance on a very old GPU ([[Nvidia]] GTX260 with 192 cores) of 4.7&amp;nbsp;ms for 5√ó10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; random 32-bit integers.

===SFMT===
{{Expand section|date=June 2007}}

The SFMT ([[single instruction, multiple data|SIMD]]-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister) is a variant of Mersenne Twister, introduced in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html|title=SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister (SFMT)|work=hiroshima-u.ac.jp|access-date=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to be fast when it runs on 128-bit SIMD.

* It is roughly twice as fast as Mersenne Twister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/speed.html|title=SFMT:Comparison of speed|work=hiroshima-u.ac.jp|access-date=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has a better [[equidistribution]] property of v-bit accuracy than MT but worse than [[Well Equidistributed Long-period Linear|WELL (&quot;Well Equidistributed Long-period Linear&quot;)]].
* It has quicker recovery from zero-excess initial state than MT, but slower than WELL.
* It supports various periods from 2&lt;sup&gt;607&lt;/sup&gt;‚àí1 to 2&lt;sup&gt;216091&lt;/sup&gt;‚àí1.

Intel [[SSE2]] and [[PowerPC]] AltiVec are supported by SFMT. It is also used for games with the [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell BE]] in the [[PlayStation 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scei.co.jp/ps3-license/index.html|title=PlayStation¬Æ3 License|work=scei.co.jp|access-date=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TinyMT===
TinyMT is a variant of Mersenne Twister, proposed by Saito and Matsumoto in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/TINYMT/index.html|title=Tiny Mersenne Twister (TinyMT)|work=hiroshima-u.ac.jp|access-date=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TinyMT uses just 127 bits of state space, a significant decrease compared to the original's 2.5 KiB of state. However, it has a period of 2&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;‚àí1, far shorter than the original, so it is only recommended by the authors in cases where memory is at a premium.

'''Social Darwinism''' describes the various theories that emerged in [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 1870s which applied biological concepts of [[natural selection]] and [[survival of the fittest]] to sociology, economics, and politics.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Herbert Spencer: Critical Assessment|editor= John Offer|pages= 186‚Äì199|isbn= 9780415181846|chapter= Social Darwinism|author= Williams, Raymond|year= 2000|location= London ; New York|publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Darwinism posits that the strong see their wealth and [[Economic power|power]] increase while the weak see their wealth and power decrease. Different social Darwinist groups have differing views about which groups of people are considered to be ''the strong'' and which groups of people are considered to be ''the weak'', and they also hold different opinions about the precise mechanisms that should be used to reward strength and punish weakness. Many such views stress [[competition]] between individuals in ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], while others were used in support of [[authoritarianism]], [[eugenics]], [[Scientific racism|racism]], [[imperialism]], [[fascism]], [[Nazism]], and struggle between national or racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys (2000). The &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; and the Origins of Social Darwinism. Journal of the History of Ideas 61 (2):223-240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=298‚Äì299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TCL&quot;&gt;Leonard, Thomas C. (2009) [http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/myth.pdf Origins of the Myth of Social Darwinism: The Ambiguous Legacy of Richard Hofstadter's Social Darwinism in American Thought] Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization 71, p.37‚Äì51&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Darwinism broadly declined in popularity as a purportedly scientific concept following the [[World War I|First World War]] and was largely discredited by the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], partially due to its association with Nazism and partially due to a growing scientific consensus that it was scientifically groundless.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;&lt;ref name=Encarta/&gt; Later theories that were categorized as social Darwinism were generally described as such as a critique by their opponents; their proponents did not identify themselves by such a label.&lt;ref name=h428&gt;{{harvnb|Hodgson|2004|pp=428‚Äì430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Encarta/&gt; [[Creationism|Creationists]] have frequently maintained that social Darwinism‚Äîleading to policies designed to reward the most competitive‚Äîis a [[logical consequence]] of &quot;Darwinism&quot; (the theory of natural selection in biology).&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul 220&quot;/&gt; Biologists and historians have stated that this is a fallacy of [[appeal to nature]], since the theory of natural selection is merely intended as a description of a biological phenomenon and should not be taken to imply that this phenomenon is ''good'' or that it ought to be used as a moral guide in human society.&lt;ref name=pinker /&gt; While most scholars recognize some historical links between the popularisation of Darwin's theory and forms of social Darwinism, they also maintain that social Darwinism is not a necessary consequence of the principles of biological evolution.

Scholars debate the extent to which the various social Darwinist ideologies reflect [[Charles Darwin]]'s own views on human social and economic issues. His writings have passages that can be interpreted as opposing aggressive individualism, while other passages appear to promote it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=300‚Äì01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's early evolutionary views and his opposition to slavery ran counter to many of the claims that social Darwinists would eventually make about the mental capabilities of the poor and colonial indigenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adrian Desmond and |first1=James Richard Moore |title=Darwin's Sacred Cause: How a Hatred of Slavery Shaped Darwin's Views on Human Evolution |date=2009 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, one strand of Darwins' followers, led by Sir John Lubbock, argued that natural selection ceased to have any noticeable effect on humans once organised societies had been formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eddy |first1=Matthew Daniel |title=The Politics of Cognition: Liberalism and the Evolutionary Origins of Victorian Education |journal=British Journal for the History of Science |date=2017 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=677‚Äì699 |doi=10.1017/S0007087417000863 |pmid=29019300|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars argue that Darwin's view gradually changed and came to incorporate views from other theorists such as [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gregory |last=Claeys |title=The 'Survival of the Fittest' and the Origins of Social Darwinism |journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=223‚Äì40 |doi=10.1353/jhi.2000.0014 |s2cid=146267804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer published&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|date=1852|title=4&quot;A Theory of Population, Deduced from the General Law of Human Fertility|journal=Westminster Review |volume=57 |pages=468‚Äì501}}&lt;/ref&gt; his [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] evolutionary ideas about society before Darwin first published his hypothesis in 1859, and both Spencer and Darwin promoted their own conceptions of moral values. Spencer supported ''laissez-faire'' capitalism on the basis of his Lamarckian belief that struggle for survival spurred [[Self-help|self-improvement]] which could be inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=301‚Äì02}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important proponent in Germany was [[Ernst Haeckel]], who popularized Darwin's thought and his personal interpretation of it, and used it as well to contribute to a new creed, the [[Monism|monist]] movement.

==Origin of the term==
The term Darwinism was coined by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in his March 1861 review of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;westminster&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A32&amp;pageseq=29|title=ART. VIII. ‚Äì Darwin on the origin of Species|author-link=Thomas Henry Huxley|date=April 1860|publisher=[[Westminster Review]]|pages=541‚Äì70|quote=What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular?|author=Huxley, T.H.|access-date=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1870s it was used to describe a range of concepts of evolution or development, without any specific commitment to Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;b179&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the phrase &quot;social Darwinism&quot; was in [[Joseph Fisher, FRHS|Joseph Fisher]]'s 1877 article on ''The History of Landholding in Ireland'' which was published in the ''[[Royal Historical Society|Transactions of the Royal Historical Society]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;/&gt; Fisher was commenting on how a system for borrowing [[livestock]] which had been called &quot;tenure&quot; had led to the false impression that the early Irish had already evolved or developed [[land tenure]];&lt;ref name=&quot;fisher77&quot;/&gt;
{{quotation|These arrangements did not in any way affect that which we understand by the word &quot; tenure&quot;, that is, a man's farm, but they related solely to cattle, which we consider a [[Personal property|chattel]]. It has appeared necessary to devote some space to this subject, inasmuch as that usually acute writer Sir Henry Maine has accepted the word &quot; tenure &quot; in its modern interpretation and has built up a theory under which the Irish chief &quot; developed &quot; into a [[feudal baron]]. I can find nothing in the [[Brehon law]]s to warrant this theory of social Darwinism, and believe the further study will show that the ''[[Early Irish law#C√°in S√≥erraith and C√°in Aicillne|C√°in Saerrath]]'' and the ''[[Early Irish law#C√°in S√≥erraith and C√°in Aicillne|C√°in Aigillne]]'' relate solely to what we now call chattels, and did not in any way affect what we now call the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]], the possession of the land.|Joseph Fisher&lt;ref name=fisher77&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1877|pp=249‚Äì50}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the fact that Social Darwinism bears Charles Darwin's name, it is also linked today with others, notably [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Thomas Malthus]], and [[Francis Galton]], the founder of eugenics. In fact, Spencer was not described as a social Darwinist until the 1930s, long after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson&lt;/ref&gt; The social Darwinism term first appeared in Europe in 1880, and journalist [[√âmile Gautier|Emilie Gautier]] had coined the term with reference to a health conference in Berlin 1877.&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Joseph|year=1877|title=The History of Landholding in Ireland|journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|volume=V|pages=228‚Äì326|jstor=3677953|doi=10.2307/3677953|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1449753}}, as quoted in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900 it was used by sociologists, some being opposed to the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=Lester F|author-link=Lester Frank Ward|year=1907|title=Social Darwinism|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=12|pages=709‚Äì10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized in the United States in 1944 by the American historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] who used it in the ideological war effort against fascism to denote a reactionary creed which promoted competitive strife, racism and chauvinism. Hofstadter later also recognized (what he saw as) the influence of Darwinist and other evolutionary ideas upon those with [[collectivist]] views, enough to devise a term for the phenomenon, &quot;Darwinist collectivism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCL&quot; /&gt; Before Hofstadter's work the use of the term &quot;social Darwinism&quot; in English academic journals was quite rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodgson|2004|pp=445‚Äì46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact,

{{quote|... there is considerable evidence that the entire concept of &quot;social Darwinism&quot; as we know it today was virtually invented by Richard Hofstadter. [[Eric Foner]], in an introduction to a then-new edition of Hofstadter's book published in the early 1990s, declines to go quite that far. &quot;Hofstadter did not invent the term Social Darwinism&quot;, Foner writes, &quot;which originated in Europe in the 1860s and crossed the Atlantic in the early twentieth century. But before he wrote, it was used only on rare occasions; he made it a standard shorthand for a complex of late-nineteenth-century ideas, a familiar part of the lexicon of social thought.&quot;|Jeff Riggenbach&lt;ref name=Riggenbach&gt;Riggenbach, Jeff (2011-04-24) [https://mises.org/daily/5206/The-Real-William-Graham-Sumner The Real William Graham Sumner], [[Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Usage ===
Social Darwinism has many definitions, and some of them are incompatible with each other. As such, social Darwinism has been criticized for being an inconsistent philosophy, which does not lead to any clear political conclusions. For example, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'' states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Part of the difficulty in establishing sensible and consistent usage is that commitment to the biology of natural selection and to 'survival of the fittest' entailed nothing uniform either for sociological method or for political doctrine. A 'social Darwinist' could just as well be a defender of laissez-faire as a defender of state socialism, just as much an imperialist as a domestic eugenist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|last=McLean|first=Iain|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199207800|location=Oxford University|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term &quot;social Darwinism&quot; has rarely been used by advocates of the supposed ideologies or ideas; instead it has almost always been used pejoratively by its opponents.&lt;ref name=&quot;h428&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=D. Paul|title=Contemporary Sociological Theory|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|year=2008|page=492|chapter=The Historical Background of Social Darwinism|quote=In the social realm the competitive struggle may be among individuals or among different groups within society, different societies, or different racial or ethnic populations.|isbn=0-387-76521-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The term draws upon the common meaning of ''[[Darwinism]]'', which includes a range of [[evolutionism|evolutionary views]], but in the late 19th century was applied more specifically to [[natural selection]] as first advanced by [[Charles Darwin]] to explain [[speciation]] in populations of [[organism]]s. The process includes competition between individuals for limited resources, popularly but inaccurately described by the phrase &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot;, a term coined by [[sociologist]] [[Herbert Spencer]]&lt;!--? or &quot;[[The Gospel of Wealth]]&quot; theory written by [[Andrew Carnegie]]--&gt;.

[[Creationism|Creationists]] have often maintained that social Darwinism‚Äîleading to policies designed to reward the most competitive‚Äîis a [[logical consequence]] of  &quot;Darwinism&quot; (the theory of natural selection in biology).&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul 220&quot;&gt;Paul, Diane B. in {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1InLet11j0C&amp;pg=PA219|title=The Cambridge Companion to Darwin|date=5 March 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-71184-5|pages=219‚Äì20|quote=Like many foes of Darwinism, past and present, the American populist and creationist William Jennings Bryan thought a straight line ran from Darwin's theory ('a dogma of darkness and death') to beliefs that it is right for the strong to crowd out the weak|author=Gregory Radick}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Biologists and historians have stated that this is a fallacy of [[appeal to nature]] and should not be taken to imply that this phenomenon ought to be used as a moral guide in human society.&lt;ref name=pinker&gt;{{cite web|title = Q&amp;A: Steven Pinker of 'Blank Slate'|url = http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/10/30/QA-Steven-Pinker-of-Blank-Slate/26021035991232/|website = [[UPI]]|access-date = 5 December 2015|date = 30 October 2002|last = Sailer|first = Steve|archive-date = 5 December 2015|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151205074319/http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/10/30/QA-Steven-Pinker-of-Blank-Slate/26021035991232/}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are historical links between the popularization of Darwin's theory and forms of social Darwinism, social Darwinism is not a necessary consequence of the principles of biological evolution.

While the term has been applied to the claim that Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] by natural selection can be used to understand the social endurance of a nation or country, social Darwinism commonly refers to ideas that predate Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Others whose ideas are given the label include the 18th century clergyman [[Thomas Malthus]], and Darwin's cousin [[Francis Galton]] who founded eugenics towards the end of the 19th century.

The expansion of the [[British Empire]] fitted in with the broader notion of social Darwinism used from the 1870s onwards to account for the remarkable and universal phenomenon of &quot;the Anglo-Saxon overflowing his boundaries&quot;, as phrased by the late-Victorian sociologist [[Benjamin Kidd]] in ''Social Evolution'', published in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Kidd]], ''Social Evolution'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2007, 400 pages, {{ISBN|978-0548805237}}, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept also proved useful to justify what was seen by some as the inevitable extermination of &quot;the weaker races who disappear before the stronger&quot; not so much &quot;through the effects of ‚Ä¶ our vices upon them&quot; as &quot;what may be called the virtues of our civilisation.&quot; Winston Churchill, a political proponent of eugenics, maintained that if fewer ‚Äòfeebleminded‚Äô individuals were born, less crime would take place.&lt;ref&gt;King, D. (1999). ''In the name of liberalism: illiberal social policy in Britain and the United States'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents ==
[[Image:Herbert Spencer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Spencer]]]]
Herbert Spencer's ideas, like those of evolutionary progressivism, stemmed from his reading of Thomas Malthus, and his later theories were influenced by those of Darwin. However, Spencer's major work, ''Progress: Its Law and Cause'' (1857), was released two years before the publication of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'', and ''First Principles'' was printed in 1860.

In ''The Social Organism'' (1860), Spencer compares society to a living organism and argues that, just as biological organisms evolve through natural selection, society evolves and increases in complexity through analogous processes.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Herbert. 1860. 'The Social Organism', originally published in ''The Westminster Review''. Reprinted in Spencer's (1892) ''Essays: Scientific, Political and Speculative''. London and New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways, Spencer's theory of cosmic evolution has much more in common with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]] and [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]] than with Darwin's.

Jeff Riggenbach argues that Spencer's view was that culture and education made a sort of [[Lamarckism]] possible&lt;ref name=Riggenbach/&gt; and notes that Herbert Spencer was a proponent of private charity.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach/&gt; However, the legacy of his social Darwinism was less than charitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Darwin|last=Paul|first=Diane B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-77197-9|location=Cambridge|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Robert Malthus Wellcome L0069037 -crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Malthus]]]]
Spencer's work also served to renew interest in the work of Malthus. While Malthus's work does not itself qualify as social Darwinism, his 1798 work ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', was incredibly popular and widely read by social Darwinists. In that book, for example, the author argued that as an increasing population would normally outgrow its food supply, this would result in the starvation of the weakest and a [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

According to [[Michael Ruse]], Darwin read Malthus' famous ''Essay on a Principle of Population'' in 1838, four years after Malthus' death. Malthus himself anticipated the social Darwinists in suggesting that charity could exacerbate social problems.

Another of these social interpretations of Darwin's biological views, later known as eugenics, was put forth by Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, in 1865 and 1869. Galton argued that just as physical traits were clearly inherited among generations of people, the same could be said for mental qualities (genius and talent). Galton argued that social morals needed to change so that heredity was a conscious decision in order to avoid both the over-breeding by less fit members of society and the under-breeding of the more fit ones.

[[Image:Francis Galton 1850s.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francis Galton]]]]
In Galton's view, social institutions such as [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] and [[psychiatric hospital|insane asylums]] were allowing inferior humans to survive and reproduce at levels faster than the more &quot;superior&quot; humans in respectable society, and if corrections were not soon taken, society would be awash with &quot;inferiors&quot;. Darwin read his cousin's work with interest, and devoted sections of ''Descent of Man'' to discussion of Galton's theories. Neither Galton nor Darwin, though, advocated any eugenic policies restricting reproduction, due to their Whiggish distrust of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Hodge|editor-first1=Jonathan|editor-last2=Radick|editor-first2=Gregory|last1=Paul|first1=Diane|chapter-url=http://www.dianebpaul.com/uploads/2/3/2/9/23295024/darwin_social_darwinism_and_eugenics.pdf|chapter= Darwin, social Darwinism and eugenics |title=The Cambridge companion to Darwin|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780511998690|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s philosophy addressed the question of artificial selection, yet Nietzsche's principles did not concur with Darwinian theories of natural selection. Nietzsche's point of view on sickness and health, in particular, opposed him to the concept of biological adaptation as forged by Spencer's &quot;fitness&quot;. Nietzsche criticized Haeckel, Spencer, and Darwin, sometimes under the same banner by maintaining that in specific cases, sickness was necessary and even helpful.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Stiegler, ''Nietzsche et la biologie'', [[PUF]], 2001, p. 90. {{ISBN|2-13-050742-5}}. See, for ex., ''[[Genealogy of Morals]]'', III, 13 here [http://malaspina.edu/~johnstoi/Nietzsche/genealogy3.htm#13]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wherever progress is to ensue, deviating natures are of greatest importance. Every progress of the whole must be preceded by a partial weakening. The strongest natures retain the type, the weaker ones help to advance it.

Something similar also happens in the individual. There is rarely a degeneration, a truncation, or even a vice or any physical or moral loss without an advantage somewhere else. In a warlike and restless clan, for example, the sicklier man may have occasion to be alone, and may therefore become quieter and wiser; the one-eyed man will have one eye the stronger; the blind man will see deeper inwardly, and certainly hear better. To this extent, the famous theory of the survival of the fittest does not seem to me to be the only viewpoint from which to explain the progress of strengthening of a man or of a race.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', ¬ß224&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[recapitulation theory]] was not Darwinism, but rather attempted to combine the ideas of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], Lamarck and Darwin. It was adopted by emerging social sciences to support the concept that non-European societies were &quot;primitive&quot;, in an early stage of development towards the European ideal, but since then it has been heavily refuted on many fronts.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite web |url=http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?id=219 |title=Ernst Haeckel and the Biogenetic Law |access-date=2008-05-03 |author=Scott F.

The simpler aspects of social Darwinism followed the earlier Malthusian ideas that humans, especially males, require competition in their lives in order to survive in the future. Further, the poor should have to provide for themselves and not be given any aid. However, amidst this climate, most social Darwinists of the early twentieth century actually supported better working conditions and salaries. Such measures would grant the poor a better chance to provide for themselves yet still distinguish those who are capable of succeeding from those who are poor out of laziness, weakness, or inferiority.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

==Hypotheses relating social change and evolution==
{{Further|Social evolution}}
&quot;Social Darwinism&quot; was first described by [[Eduard Oscar Schmidt]] of the [[University of Strasbourg]], reporting at a scientific and medical conference held in Munich in 1877. He [https://archive.org/details/doctrinedescent00schmgoog ''noted''] how socialists, although opponents of Darwin's theory, used it to add force to their political arguments. Schmidt's essay first appeared in English in ''[[Popular Science]]'' in March 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Oscar|author2=J. Fitzgerald (translator)|date=March 1879|title=Science and Socialism|journal=Popular Science Monthly|volume=14|pages=577‚Äì91|issn=0161-7370|quote=Darwinism is the scientific establishment of inequality}}&lt;/ref&gt; There followed an anarchist tract published in Paris in 1880 entitled &quot;Le darwinisme social&quot; by [[√âmile Gautier]]. However, the use of the term was very rare‚Äîat least in the English-speaking world (Hodgson, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;but see {{cite journal |last=Wells |first=D. Collin |year=1907 |title=Social Darwinism |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=695‚Äì716 |jstor=2762378 |doi=10.1086/211544|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1431285 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîuntil the American historian Richard Hofstadter published his influential ''Social Darwinism in American Thought'' (1944) during [[World War II]].

Hypotheses of social evolution and [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]] were common in Europe. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers who preceded Darwin, such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], often argued that societies progressed through stages of increasing development. Earlier thinkers also emphasized conflict as an inherent feature of social life. [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s 17th century portrayal of the [[state of nature]] seems analogous to the competition for natural resources described by Darwin. Social Darwinism is distinct from other theories of social change because of the way it draws Darwin's distinctive ideas from the field of biology into social studies.

Darwin, unlike Hobbes, believed that this struggle for natural resources allowed individuals with certain physical and mental traits to succeed more frequently than others, and that these traits accumulated in the population over time, which under certain conditions could lead to the descendants being so different that they would be defined as a new species.

However, Darwin felt that &quot;social [[instinct]]s&quot; such as &quot;sympathy&quot; and &quot;[[moral philosophy|moral sentiments]]&quot; also evolved through natural selection, and that these resulted in the strengthening of societies in which they occurred, so much so that he wrote about it in ''Descent of Man'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The following proposition seems to me in a high degree probable‚Äînamely, that any animal whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well, or nearly as well developed, as in man. For, firstly, the social instincts lead an animal to take pleasure in the society of its fellows, to feel a certain amount of sympathy with them, and to perform various services for them.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Descent of Man/Chapter IV|Descent of Man, chapter 4]] {{ISBN|1-57392-176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Nazi Germany==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-067-10, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Alfred Rosenberg]]]]
Nazi Germany's justification for its aggression was regularly promoted in [[Nazi propaganda]] films depicting scenes such as beetles fighting in a lab setting to demonstrate the principles of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; as depicted in ''[[Alles Leben ist Kampf]]'' (English translation: ''All Life is Struggle''). [[Hitler]] often refused to intervene in the promotion of officers and staff members, preferring instead to have them fight amongst themselves to force the &quot;stronger&quot; person to prevail‚Äî&quot;strength&quot; referring to those social forces void of virtue or principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imdb.com/title/tt0207907/ cf. 1997 BBC documentary: &quot;The Nazis: A Warning from History&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Key proponents were [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who was hanged later at Nuremberg. Such ideas also helped to advance [[euthanasia]] in Germany, especially [[Action T4]], which led to the murder of mentally ill and disabled people in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=T4 Program {{!}} Definition and History|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/T4-Program|access-date=2020-08-26|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that Nazi ideology was strongly influenced by social Darwinist ideas is often found in historical and social science literature.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Weingart, P., J. Kroll, and K. Bayertz, Rasse, Blut, und Gene. Geschichte der Eugenik und Rassenhygiene in Deutschland (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the philosopher and historian [[Hannah Arendt]] analysed the historical development from a politically indifferent scientific Darwinism via social Darwinist ethics to racist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, H.: Elements of Totalitarianism, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: New York 1951. pp. 178‚Äì179&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1985, creationists were taking up the argument that Nazi ideology was directly influenced by Darwinian evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;ToA CA002.1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = CA002.1: Social Darwinism. | url = http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA002_1.html | publisher = [[TalkOrigins Archive]] | date = 2003-09-26 | access-date = 25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such claims have been presented by creationists such as [[Jonathan Sarfati]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sarfati (2002) &quot;[http://creation.com/nazis-planned-to-exterminate-christianity Nazis planned to exterminate Christianity]&quot; ''Creation'' 24:3 p27ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sarfati (1999) &quot;[http://creation.com/the-holocaust-and-evolution The Holocaust and evolution]&quot; ''Creation'' 22:1 p4ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intelligent design]] creationism supporters have promoted this position as well. For example, it is a theme in the work of [[Richard Weikart]], who is a historian at [[California State University, Stanislaus]], and a senior fellow for the [[Center for Science and Culture]] of the [[Discovery Institute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DI&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.discovery.org/a/2247 | title=Senior Fellow Richard Weikart responds to Sander Gliboff | publisher=[[Center for Science and Culture]] |date= 10 October 2004 | first=Richard | last=Weikart | access-date =2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=We should cite a secondary source for such controversial claims; the Discovery Institute certainly is not a reliable source.|date=December 2019}}
It is also a main argument in the 2008 intelligent-design/creationist movie ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]''.

Richards]] describes the link as a myth that ignores far more obvious causes of Nazism - including the &quot;pervasive anti-Semitic miasma created by Christian apologists&quot; - and dismisses efforts to tie Darwin to Nazism as &quot;crude lever&quot; used by religious fundamentalists to try and reduce public support for Darwin's theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Ronald L.|editor-last=Numbers|title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths about Science and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Wj-ruvGFvgC|publisher=Harvard University Press|date= 2009|isbn=978-0-674-03327-6|via=Google Books|last=Richards|first=Robert J|chapter=That Darwin and Haeckel Were Complicit in Nazi Biology.|chapter-url=https://home.uchicago.edu/~rjr6/articles/Myth.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar criticisms are sometimes applied (or misapplied) to other political or scientific theories that resemble social Darwinism, for example criticisms leveled at [[evolutionary psychology]]. For example, a critical reviewer of Weikart's book writes that &quot;(h)is historicization of the moral framework of evolutionary theory poses key issues for those in sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, not to mention bioethicists, who have recycled many of the suppositions that Weikart has traced.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;h-net.msu.edu&quot;/&gt;

Another example is recent scholarship that portrays Ernst Haeckel's Monist League as a mystical progenitor of the [[V√∂lkisch movement]] and, ultimately, of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] of Adolf Hitler. Scholars opposed to this interpretation, however, have pointed out that the Monists were [[Freethought|freethinkers]] who opposed all forms of [[mysticism]], and that their organizations were immediately banned following the Nazi takeover in 1933 because of their association with a wide variety of causes including [[feminism]], [[pacifism]], [[human rights]], and early [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first=Richard | last=Weikart | title=&quot;Evolution√§re Aufkl√§rung&quot;?

Sumner argued that societal progress depended on the &quot;fittest families&quot; passing down wealth and genetic traits to their offspring, thus allegedly creating a lineage of superior citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; However, contemporary social scientists repudiate such claims, and demand that economic status be considered ''not'' a direct function of one's inborn traits and moral worth.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; 

In 1883, Sumner published a highly influential pamphlet entitled &quot;What Social Classes Owe to Each Other&quot;, in which he insisted that the social classes owe each other nothing, synthesizing Darwin's findings with free enterprise Capitalism for his justification.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} According to Sumner, those who feel an obligation to provide assistance to those unequipped or under-equipped to compete for resources, will lead to a country in which the weak and inferior are encouraged to breed more like them, eventually dragging the country down. Sumner also believed that the best equipped to win the struggle for existence was the American businessman, and concluded that taxes and regulations serve as dangers to his survival. This pamphlet makes no mention of Darwinism, and only refers to Darwin in a statement on the meaning of liberty, that &quot;There never has been any man, from the primitive barbarian up to a [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]] or a Darwin, who could do as he had a mind to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18603/18603-h/18603-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of What Social Classes Owe To Each Other, by William Graham Sumner.|date=2006-06-16|website=www.gutenberg.org|access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

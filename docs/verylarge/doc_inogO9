{{corporal punishment}}

'''Spanking''' is a common form of [[corporal punishment]], involving the act of striking the [[buttocks]] of another person to cause physical pain, generally with an open hand. More severe forms of spanking, such as switching, [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]], [[Belting (beating)|belting]], [[caning]], [[Flagellation|whipping]], and [[birching]], involve the use of an object instead of a hand.

Parents may spank [[child]]ren in response to undesired behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zolotor|first1=AJ|title=Corporal punishment|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|date=October 2014|volume=61|issue=5|pages=971–8|doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2014.06.003|pmid=25242709|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sylvester, Foster|first=Charles Herbert, Ellsworth D.|date=1919|title=The New Practical Reference Library, Volume 2|url=|journal=The New Practical Reference Library|volume=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults more commonly spank boys than girls, both at home and in school.&lt;ref name=Primordial/&gt; Some countries have [[Child corporal punishment laws|outlawed the spanking of children]] in every setting, including homes, schools, and [[Prison|penal institutions]],&lt;ref name=&quot;States which&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/progress/prohibiting-states/ |title=States which have prohibited all corporal punishment |publisher=Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most allow it when done by a parent or guardian.

==Terminology==
In [[North America]], the word &quot;spanking&quot; has often been used as a synonym for an official paddling in school,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. &quot;Corporal punishment — spanking or paddling the student — may be used as a discipline management technique .... The instrument to be used in administering corporal punishment shall be approved by the principal or designee&quot;.[http://www.mwpisd.esc18.net/mhs/student_handbook/07_08/stu_handbook07_08.htm Texas Association of School Boards&amp;nbsp;– Standard Code of Conduct wording.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070625124440/http://www.mwpisd.esc18.net/mhs/student_handbook/07_08/stu_handbook07_08.htm |date=25 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes even as a euphemism for the formal corporal punishment of adults in an institution.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.corpun.com/cajur3.htm Evidence of Colonel G. Headly Basher, Deputy Minister for Reform Institutions, Ontario], Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on Capital and Corporal Punishment and Lotteries, Canada, 1953–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[British English]], most dictionaries define &quot;spanking&quot; as being given only with the open hand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary: &quot;Spank: To slap or smack (a person, esp. a child) with the open hand.&quot; Collins English Dictionary: &quot;Spank: To slap or smack with the open hand, esp. on the buttocks.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flagellation]] was so common in England as punishment that spanking (and [[caning]] and [[whipping]]) are called &quot;the English vice&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MurrayMurrell1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas Edward Murray|author2=Thomas R. Murrell|title=The Language of Sadomasochism: A Glossary and Linguistic Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tL81ZduPn_UC&amp;pg=PA23|year=1989|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-26481-8|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[American English]], dictionaries define spanking as being administered with either the open hand or an implement such as a [[paddle (spanking)|paddle]].&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: &quot;Spank: To slap on the buttocks with a flat object or with the open hand, as for punishment.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the standard form of corporal punishment in US schools (use of a paddle) is often referred to as a ''spanking''.

In the [[United Kingdom]], Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, the word &quot;smacking&quot; is generally used in preference to &quot;spanking&quot; when describing striking with an open hand, rather than with an implement. Whereas a spanking is invariably administered to the bottom, a &quot;smacking&quot; is less specific and may refer to slapping the child's hands, arms or legs as well as its bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary: &quot;Smack: To strike (a person, part of the body, etc.) with the open hand or with something having a flat surface; to slap. Also spec. to chastise (a child) in this manner and fig.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents commonly spank their children as a form of [[corporal punishment]] in the [[United States]]; however, support for this practice appears to be declining amongst U.S. parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPSege2018&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sege |first1=RD |last2=Siegel |first2=BS |last3=Council on Child Abuse and Neglect; Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health. |title=Effective Discipline to Raise Healthy Children |journal=Pediatrics |date=December 2018 |volume=142 |issue=6 |pages=e20183112 |doi=10.1542/peds.2018-3112 |pmid=30397164|s2cid=53239513 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanking is typically done with one or more [[Slapping (strike)|slaps]] on the child's [[buttocks]] with a bare hand, although, not uncommonly, various objects are used to spank children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt; Historically, adults spank boys more than girls.&lt;ref name=Primordial&gt;{{cite book |author1=Straus, Murray A. |author2=Douglas, Emily M. |author3=Madeiros, Rose Ann |title=The Primordial Violence: Spanking Children, Psychological Development, Violence, and Crime |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |date=2013 |isbn=978-1848729537 |pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elder&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Family Structure and Child Rearing Patterns: The Effect of Family Size and Sex Composition|jstor=2090309 |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |year=1963 |first=G.H. |last=Elder|author2=Bowerman, C.

However, research has shown that spanking (or any other form of corporal punishment) is associated with the opposite effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPSege2018&quot;/&gt; When adults physically punish children, the children tend to obey parents less with time and develop more aggressive behaviors, including toward other children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt; This increase in aggressive behavior appears to reflect the [[Social learning theory|child's perception]] that hitting is the way to deal with anger and frustration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt; There are also many adverse physical, mental, and emotional effects correlated with spanking and other forms of corporal punishment, including various physical [[injury|injuries]], increased [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial behavior]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Development&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gershoff |first=Elizabeth T. |date= September 2013 |title= Spanking and Child Development: We Know Enough Now to Stop Hitting Our Children |journal= Child Development Perspectives |publisher= The Society for Research in Child Development |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=133–137 |doi=10.1111/cdep.12038 |pmid=24039629 |pmc=3768154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMillan2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacMillan |first1=HL |last2=Mikton |first2=CR |title=Moving research beyond the spanking debate. |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |date=September 2017 |volume=71 |pages=5–8 |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.02.012 |pmid=28249733|url=http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/31256/1/Final%20with%20Abstract_CRM.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults who were spanked during their childhood are more likely to abuse their children and spouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP), [[Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health]] (RCPCH), and the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]] (RACP) all recommend that no child should be spanked and instead favor the use of effective, healthy forms of discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPSege2018&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RCPCHPositionStatement&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Position Statement on corporal punishment |url=http://rcpch.adlibhosting.com/files/Corporal%20Punishment%20Position%20Statement%202009-11.pdf |website=rcpch.adlibhosting.com |publisher=The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RACPPositionStatement&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Position Statement: Physical Punishment of Children |url=https://www.racp.edu.au/docs/default-source/default-document-library/physical-punishment-of-children.pdf |website=www.racp.edu.au |publisher=The Royal Australasian College of Physicians}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the AAP recommends that [[primary care provider]]s (e.g., [[pediatrician]]s and [[family medicine]] [[physician]]s)  begin to discuss parents' discipline methods no later than nine months of age and consider initiating such discussions by age 3–4 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt; By eight months of age, 5% of parents report spanking and 5% report starting to spank by age three months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt; The AAP also recommends that pediatricians discuss effective discipline strategies and counsel parents about the ineffectiveness of spanking and the risks of harmful effects associated with the practice to minimize harm to children and guide parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPSege2018&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orentlicher|first=David|date=1998|title=Spanking and Other Corporal Punishment of Children by Parents: Undervaluing Children, Overvaluing Pain|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2028343|journal=Houston Law Review|volume=38|pages=147|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although parents and other advocates of spanking often claim that spanking is necessary to promote [[child discipline]], studies have shown that parents tend to apply physical punishment inconsistently and tend to spank more often when they are angry or under [[stress (psychology)|stress]].&lt;ref name=Guidance&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health |title=Guidance for effective discipline |journal=Pediatrics |volume=101 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=723–8 |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |date=April 1998 |pmid=9521967 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/101/4/723|doi=10.1542/peds.101.4.723 |s2cid=79545678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of corporal punishment by parents increases the likelihood that children will suffer [[physical abuse]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt; and most documented cases of physical abuse in Canada and the United States begin as disciplinary spankings.&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gershoff, Elizabeth T. |date=Spring 2010 |title=More Harm Than Good: A Summary of Scientific Research on the Intended and Unintended Effects of Corporal Punishment on Children |url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol73/iss2/3/ |journal=Law &amp; Contemporary Problems |publisher=Duke University School of Law |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=31–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a child is frequently spanked, this form of corporal punishment tends to become less effective at modifying behavior over time (also known as extinction).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt; In response to decreased effectiveness of spanking, some parents increase the frequency or severity of spanking or use an object.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt;

===Alternatives to spanking===
Parents may spank less - or not at all - if they have learned effective discipline techniques, since many parents view spanking as a method of last resort to discipline their children.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPSege2018&quot;/&gt; There are many alternatives to spanking and other forms of corporal punishment:

*Time-in, increasing, praise, and special time to promote desired behaviors
*[[Time-out (parenting)|Time outs]] to take a break from escalating misbehavior
*[[Positive reinforcement]] of rewarding desirable behavior with a star, sticker, or treat
*Implementing non-physical [[negative reinforcement]] in which an unpleasant consequence follows misbehavior, such as taking away a privilege
*Ignoring low-level misbehaviors and prioritizing attention on more significant forms of misbehavior
*Avoiding the opportunity for the misbehavior to occur and thus the need for corrective discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zolotor2014&quot;/&gt;{{better source|date=June 2020}}

==In schools==
{{Main|School corporal punishment}}
Corporal punishment, usually delivered with an implement (such as a paddle or [[caning|cane]]) rather than with the open hand, used to be a common form of school discipline in many countries, but it is now banned in most of the Western World.

Corporal punishment, such as caning, remains a common form of discipline in schools in several Asian and African countries, even in countries in which this practice has been deemed illegal such as [[India]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pak |first1=Jennifer |title=Malaysia's love for the cane is questioned |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26883902 |work=BBC News |date=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Corporal punishment 'widespread' in Indian schools |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11617206 |accessdate=20 June 2018 |work=BBC News |date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Seale |first1=Lebogang |title=Severe corporal punishment still carried out at many SA schools |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/opinion/severe-corporal-punishment-still-carried-out-at-many-sa-schools-11514666 |accessdate=20 June 2018 |publisher=IOL |date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cultures it is referred to as &quot;caning&quot; and not &quot;spanking.&quot;

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1977 held that the paddling of school students was not ''per se'' unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ingraham v. Wright]], 97, S.Ct. 1401 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; However, 31 states have now banned paddling in public schools. It is still common in some schools in the South, and more than 167,000 students were paddled in the 2011-2012 school year in American public schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/12/corporal-punishment/420420/|title=The States Where Teachers Can Still Spank Students|last=Anderson|first=Melinda D.|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=10 May 2016|date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can be physically punished from kindergarten to the end of high school, meaning that even [[adult]]s who have reached the [[age of majority]] are sometimes spanked by school officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;corpun&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.corpun.com/counuss.htm |title= Corporal punishment in US schools |author= C. Farrell |date=October 2016 |website= www.corpun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of medical, pediatric or psychological societies have issued statements opposing all forms of corporal punishment in schools, citing such outcomes as poorer academic achievements, increases in antisocial behaviors, injuries to students, and an unwelcoming learning environment. They include the [[American Medical Association]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NCACPS list&quot;&gt;[https://www.ama-assn.org/ssl3/ecomm/PolicyFinderForm.pl?site=www.ama-assn.org&amp;uri=/resources/html/PolicyFinder/policyfiles/HnE/H-515.995.HTM &quot;H-515.995 Corporal Punishment in Schools&quot;].

Men spanking their wives and girlfriends was often seen as an acceptable form of domestic discipline in the early 20th century as a way to correct behavior, maintain male dominance, and enforce gender norms.

There are some rituals or traditions which involve spanking. For example, on the first day of the lunar Chinese new year holidays, a week-long 'Spring Festival', the most important festival for Chinese people all over the world, thousands of Chinese visit the Taoist ''Dong Lung Gong'' temple in Tungkang to go through the century-old ritual to get rid of bad luck. Men traditionally receive spankings and women get whipped, with the number of strokes to be administered (always lightly) by the temple staff being decided in either case by the god Wang Ye and by burning incense and tossing two pieces of wood, after which all go home happily, believing their luck will improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Ring in the new year with a spanking for luck |url=http://www.corpun.com/twi00401.htm |work=Independent Online (South Africa) |date=26 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Easter Monday]], there is a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tradition of spanking girls and young ladies with [[Easter whip|woven willow switches]] (Czech: ''pomlázka''; Slovak: ''korbáč'') and dousing them with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Ember, Melvin |author2=Ember, Carol R. | title = Encyclopedia of sex and gender: men and women in the world's cultures| publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum| location = New York| year = 2004| isbn = 0-306-47770-X|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oGasFR3USxYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA382,M1 382]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Montley, Patricia| title = In Nature's Honor: Myths And Rituals Celebrating The Earth| location = Boston, MA| publisher = Skinner House Books| year = 2005| isbn = 1-55896-486-X|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cxzHq4SmCucC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA56,M1 56]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Knab, Sophie Hodorowicz| title = Polish customs, traditions, and folklore| publisher = Hippocrene| year = 1993| isbn = 0-7818-0068-4|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slovenia]], there is a jocular tradition that anyone who succeeds in climbing to the top of [[Mount Triglav]] receives a spanking or birching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reach for the top and a birching |first=Joanna |last=Walters |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 November 2000 | location=London | url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2000/nov/12/climbingholidays.slovenia.observerescapesection }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Postal Service''' ('''USPS'''; also known as the '''Post Office''', '''U.S. Mail''', or '''Postal Service''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency]] of the executive branch of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]] responsible for providing [[mail|postal service]] in the [[United States]], including its [[insular area]]s and [[Compact of Free Association|associated states]]. It is one of the few government agencies [[Postal Clause|explicitly authorized by]] the [[United States Constitution]].

The USPS traces its roots to 1775 during the [[Second Continental Congress]], when [[Benjamin Franklin]] was appointed the first [[United States Postmaster General|postmaster general]]. The [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office Department]] was created in 1792 with the passage of the [[Postal Service Act]]. It was elevated to a [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet-level]] department in 1872, and was transformed by the [[Postal Reorganization Act|Postal Reorganization Act of 1970]] into the United States Postal Service as an independent agency.&lt;ref&gt;Postal Reorganization Act, Pub. Law No. 91-375, 84 Stat. 719, at 720 (Aug. 12, 1970), codified at {{usc|39|201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1980s, many direct tax subsidies to the USPS (with the exception of subsidies for costs associated with disabled and overseas voters) have been reduced or eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/five-things/the-u-s-postal-service/11433/ |title=The U.S. Postal Service; PBS|date=2011-11-13|publisher=PBS|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014091138/https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/five-things/the-u-s-postal-service/11433/ |archive-date=2019-10-14|access-date=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USPS, as of 2019, has 469,934 career employees and 136,174 non-career employees. The Postal Service is legally obligated to serve all Americans, regardless of geography, at uniform price and quality. The Post Office has exclusive access&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/230/224237.pdf|title=Information About Restrictions on Mailbox Access|date=May 30, 1997|website=United States General Accounting Office|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524195204/http://www.gao.gov/assets/230/224237.pdf|archive-date=May 24, 2017|access-date=April 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[letter box]]es marked &quot;U.S. Mail&quot; and personal letterboxes in the United States, but has to compete against private [[package delivery]] services, such as [[United Parcel Service]], [[FedEx]], and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Service and the Postal Monopoly: A Brief History|url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/universal-service-postal-monopoly-history.pdf|publisher=The United States Postal Service|access-date=11 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224062209/http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/universal-service-postal-monopoly-history.pdf|archive-date=24 February 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor| strike &amp; reorganization }}On March 18, 1970, postal workers in New York City—upset over low wages and poor working conditions, and emboldened by the Civil Rights Movement—[[U.S. postal strike of 1970|organized a strike]] against the United States government. The strike initially involved postal workers in only New York City, but it eventually gained support of over 210,000 [[United States Post Office Department]] workers across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Great 1970 Mail Strike that Stunned the Country |work=Labor History Articles |publisher=American Postal Workers Union |date=March 2017 |url=https://www.apwu.org/labor-history-articles/great-1970-mail-strike-stunned-country |access-date=22 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422103224/https://www.apwu.org/labor-history-articles/great-1970-mail-strike-stunned-country |archive-date=22 April 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the strike ended without any concessions from the Federal government, it did ultimately allow for postal worker unions and the government to negotiate a contract which gave the unions most of what they wanted, as well as the signing of the [[Postal Reorganization Act]] by President [[Richard Nixon]] on August 12, 1970.

In a 2006 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision, the Court noted: &quot;Each day, according to the Government's submissions here, the United States Postal Service delivers some 660 million pieces of mail to as many as 142&amp;nbsp;million delivery points.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dolan v.

Update: In 2017, the figure for number of delivery points was 157.3&amp;nbsp;million (See citation name=sizescope2016).&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the USPS operates 30,825 post offices and locations in the U.S., and delivers 149.5&amp;nbsp;billion pieces of mail annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;sizescope2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= https://facts.usps.com/size-and-scope/ | title= Size and scope | website= About USPS | publisher= United States Postal Service | access-date= 2018-12-08 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181215040258/https://facts.usps.com/size-and-scope/ | archive-date= 2018-12-15 | url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USPS operates one of the largest civilian [[vehicle fleet]]s in the world, with an estimated 227,896 vehicles,&lt;ref name=&quot;sizescope2016&quot;/&gt; the majority of which are the easily identified [[Chevrolet]]/[[Grumman LLV]] (long-life vehicle), and the newer Ford/Utilimaster FFV (flex-fuel vehicle), originally also referred to as the CRV (carrier route vehicle). Made from 1987 to 1994 and with no air conditioning, no airbags, no anti-lock brakes, and lacking space for the large modern volume of e-commerce packages, the Grumman fleet ended its expected lifespan in fiscal year 2017. The replacement process began in 2015, and prototypes have been produced by various bidders, but due to delays as of May 2020, a final contract for replacement trucks has not been awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trucks.com/2020/05/12/postal-service-delays-mail-truck-production-contract/ Postal Service Delays Production Contract for New Mail Truck]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth of York''' (11 February 1466 – 11 February 1503) was the first [[queen consort of England]] of the [[Tudor dynasty]] from 18 January 1486 until her death. She was the wife of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] whom she married in 1486 after his victory at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], which marked the end of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Together, Elizabeth and Henry had seven children.

After the death of her father, King [[Edward IV]], Elizabeth's brothers the &quot;[[Princes in the Tower]]&quot; disappeared, their fate uncertain. Although the 1484 act of Parliament ''[[Titulus Regius]]'' declared the marriage of her parents, Edward and [[Elizabeth Woodville]], invalid, she and her sisters were subsequently welcomed back to court by Edward's brother, King [[Richard III]]. As a [[Yorkist]] princess, the final victory of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] faction in the Wars of the Roses may have seemed a further disaster, but Henry Tudor knew the importance of Yorkist support for his invasion and promised to marry Elizabeth before he arrived in England. This may well have contributed to the haemorrhaging of Yorkist support for Richard.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Annette. &quot;Richard III. The Maligned King.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Elizabeth seems to have played little part in politics, her marriage appears to have been a successful and happy one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Winter king : Henry VII and the dawn of Tudor England|last=Penn, Thomas.|date=2012|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-9156-9|edition=1st Simon &amp; Schuster hardcover|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/winterkinghenryv00penn/page/97 97-100]|oclc=741542832|url=https://archive.org/details/winterkinghenryv00penn/page/97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henry VII|last=Chrimes, S.

== Daughter of the king ==
Elizabeth of York was born at the [[Palace of Westminster]] as the eldest child of [[Edward IV of England|King]] Edward IV and his wife, [[Elizabeth Woodville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elizabeth of York : the forgotten Tudor queen|last=Licence, Amy|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-1-4456-3314-5|location=Stroud|pages=38|oclc=885312679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her christening was celebrated at [[Westminster Abbey]], sponsored by her grandmothers, [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg]], Duchess of Bedford, and [[Cecily Neville]], Duchess of York. Her third sponsor was her cousin [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]].&lt;ref name=engilshmonarchs&gt;{{cite web|title=The House of Tudor|url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/tudor_11.htm|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:York Sisters.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth with her sisters. She is the first from the left. ]]
In 1469, aged three, she was briefly betrothed to [[George Neville, Duke of Bedford|George Neville]]. His father [[John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu|John]] later supported George's uncle, the Earl of Warwick, in rebellion against King Edward IV, and the betrothal was called off.{{sfn|Okerlund|2009|p=5}} In 1475, [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] agreed to the marriage of nine-year-old Elizabeth of York to his son [[Charles VIII of France|Charles]], the Dauphin of France. In 1482, however, Louis XI reneged on his promise.{{sfn|Okerlund|2009|pp=13-19}} She was named a [[List of Ladies of the Garter|Lady of the Garter]] in 1477, at age eleven, along with her mother and her paternal aunt [[Elizabeth of York, Duchess of Suffolk]].

== Sister of the king ==
On 9 April 1483, Elizabeth's father, King Edward IV, unexpectedly died and her younger brother, [[Edward V of England|Edward V]], ascended to the throne; her uncle, [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], was appointed regent and protector of his nephews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/richard-iii-9457120 |title=Richard III – King – Biography.com |website=Biography.com |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gloucester opted to take steps to isolate his nephews from their Woodville relations, including their own mother.

He intercepted Edward V while the latter was travelling from [[Ludlow]], where he had been living as Prince of Wales, to London to be crowned king. Edward V was placed in the royal residence of the [[Tower of London]], ostensibly for his protection. Elizabeth Woodville fled with her younger son Richard and her daughters, taking sanctuary in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Gloucester asked Archbishop Bourchier to take Richard with him, so that the boy could reside in the Tower and keep his brother Edward company. Elizabeth Woodville, under duress, eventually agreed.{{sfn|Okerlund|2009|pp=21-32}}

Two months later, on 22 June 1483, Edward IV's marriage was declared invalid. It was claimed that Edward IV had, at the time of his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, already been betrothed to [[Lady Eleanor Talbot|Lady Eleanor Butler]]. Parliament issued a bill, ''[[Titulus Regius]]'' (&quot;Royal Title&quot;), in support of this position.{{sfn|Okerlund|2009|pp=21-32}} This measure legally bastardised the children of Edward IV, made them ineligible for the succession, and declared Gloucester the rightful king, with the right of succession reverting to children of [[George, 1st Duke of Clarence]], another late brother of Gloucester, who had been [[attainder|attainted]] in 1478. Gloucester ascended to the throne as Richard III on 6 July 1483, and Edward and Richard disappeared soon afterwards. Rumours began to spread that they had been murdered, and these appear to have been increasingly widely credited, even though some undoubtedly emanated from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/princes_in_tower.shtml|title=BBC – History – Historic Figures: The Princes in the Tower|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Niece of the king ==
Elizabeth's mother made an alliance with [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]], mother of Henry Tudor, later King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], who had the closest claim to the throne among the Lancastrian party. Although Henry Tudor was descended from [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]],&lt;ref&gt;Genealogical Tables in Morgan, (1988), p.709&lt;/ref&gt; his claim to the throne was weak, owing to an Act of Parliament of the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] in the 1390s, which barred accession to the throne to any heirs of the legitimised offspring of Henry's great-great-grandparents, [[John of Gaunt]] and [[Katherine Swynford]]. Whether such an unprecedented act had force of law is disputed.{{By whom|date=March 2020}} Whatever the merits of Henry's claim, his mother and Elizabeth Woodville agreed he should move to claim the throne and, once he had taken it, marry Elizabeth of York to unite the two rival houses. In December 1483, in the cathedral of [[Rennes]], Henry Tudor swore an oath promising to marry her and began planning an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henry VII|last=Chrimes, S. B. (Stanley Bertram), 1907-1984.|date=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-02266-1|location=Berkeley [Calif.]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/henryvii00chri/page/65 65]|oclc=567203|url=https://archive.org/details/henryvii00chri/page/65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1484, Elizabeth of York and her sisters left Westminster Abbey and returned to court when Elizabeth Woodville was apparently reconciled with Richard III. This may or may not suggest that Elizabeth Woodville believed Richard III to be innocent of any possible role in the murder of her two sons (although this is unlikely owing to her involvement in Henry Tudor's failed invasion of October 1483 and her collaboration with his mother, [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret]], in 1485 to bring Richard down once and for all.)  It was rumoured that Richard III intended to marry Elizabeth of York because his wife, [[Anne Neville]], was dying and they had no surviving children. The ''[[Crowland Chronicle]]'' claimed that Richard III was forced to deny this unsavoury rumour.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The rise of the Tudors : the family that changed English history|last=Skidmore, Chris, 1981-|publisher=|year=|isbn=1-250-06144-X|edition=First St. Martin's Griffin|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=199–200|oclc=881437225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Anne Neville's death, Richard III sent Elizabeth away from court to the castle of [[Sheriff Hutton]] and opened negotiations with King [[John II of Portugal]] to marry his sister, [[Joan, Princess of Portugal]], and to have Elizabeth marry their cousin, the future King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;Barrie Williams, &quot;The Portuguese Connection and the Significance of the 'Holy Princess'&quot;, ''The Ricardian'', Vol. 6, No. 90, March 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Tudor and his army landed in Wales on 7 August 1485 and marched inland. On 22 August, Henry Tudor and Richard III fought the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]]. Richard III had the larger army, but was betrayed by one of his most powerful retainers, [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William Stanley]], and died in battle. Henry Tudor took the crown by [[right of conquest]] as [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tudorhistory.org/henry7/|title=Henry VII|work=tudorhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the eldest daughter of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] with no surviving [[Princes in the Tower|brothers]], Elizabeth of York had a strong claim to the throne in her own right, but she did not assume the throne as [[queen regnant]]. There was no queen regnant until 1553, when her granddaughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], acceded to the throne; the last attempt a female had made at ruling in her own right resulted in disaster when the [[Empress Matilda|mother]] and [[Stephen, King of England|uncle]] of [[Henry II of England]] fought bitterly for the throne in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=History explorer: Stephen and Matilda's fight for the throne|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/medieval/history-explorer-stephen-and-matildas-fight-for-the-throne/|website=HistoryExtra|language=en|access-date=2020-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Though initially slow to keep his promise,&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Audrey. ''The Mysteries of the Princes''.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry VII acknowledged the necessity of marrying Elizabeth of York to ensure the stability of his rule and weaken the claims of other surviving members of the [[House of York]]. It seems Henry wished to be seen as ruling in his own right, having claimed the throne by right of conquest and not by his marriage to the ''de facto'' heiress of the House of York. He had no intention of sharing power.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, W. (1765). ''[http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-103.htm Commentaries on the Laws of England]''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; He consequently chose to be crowned on 30 October 1485, before his marriage.

Henry VII had the Act of ''[[Titulus Regius]]'' repealed, thereby legitimising anew the children of Edward IV, and acknowledging Edward V as his predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henry VII|last=Chrimes, S.

Henry and Elizabeth required a papal dispensation to wed because of Canon Law frowning upon 'affinity&quot;: Both were descended from [[John of Gaunt]] or his older brother [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel]] in the 4th degree, an issue that had caused much dispute and bloodshed as to which claim was superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sprey|first1=Ilicia J.|last2=Morgan|first2=Kenneth O.|date=2001|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain|journal=Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=32|issue=3|pages=867|doi=10.2307/2671570|jstor=2671570|issn=0361-0160}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Why Lancaster DID have a better claim than York – at least according to Edward III – Royal History Geeks|url=https://www.royalhistorygeeks.com/why-lancaster-did-have-a-better-claim-than-york-at-least-according-to-edward-iii/|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two applications were sent, the first more locally, and the second one was slow in reaching Rome and slow to return with the response of the Pope. Ultimately, however, the marriage was approved by [[papal bull]] of [[Pope Innocent VIII]] dated March 1486 (one month after the wedding)  stating that the Pope and his advisors ''&quot;approveth confirmyth and stablishyth the matrimonye and coniuncion made betwene our sou[er]ayn lord King Henre the seuenth of the house of Lancastre of that one party And the noble Princesse Elyzabeth of the house of Yorke.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Text of Papal Bull on the Marriage of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York|url=https://tudorhistory.org/primary/h7marriagebull/text.html|website=tudorhistory.org|access-date=2020-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the journey to Rome and back took many months, and because Henry as king wanted to be certain that nobody could claim that his wedding to Elizabeth was unlawful or sinful, the more local application was obeyed first - it was sent to the papal legate for England and Scotland, which returned in January 1486.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Okerlund|first=A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sauDDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=response+of+pope+to+dispensation+Elizabeth+of+York&amp;pg=PA48|title=Elizabeth of York|date=2009-09-28|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-10065-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Cardinal Bourchier]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], officiated at the wedding of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York on 18 January 1486 in Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2020|reason=Source does not specify a location.}} Their first son, [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], was born on 20 September 1486, eight months after their marriage. Elizabeth of York was crowned queen on 25 November 1487. She gave birth to several more children, but only four survived infancy: Arthur, [[Margaret Tudor|Margaret]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry]] and [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]].

Despite being a political arrangement at first, the marriage proved successful and both partners appear to have slowly fallen in love with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Okerlund|2009|pp=99–118, 185–186, 203–204}}; Williams (1977), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Penn, in his biography of Henry VII writes that &quot;[t]hough founded on pragmatism, Henry and Elizabeth's marriage had nevertheless blossomed throughout the uncertainty and upheaval of the previous eighteen years.

=== Relationship with Henry Tudor ===

Regardless of her husband's  ultimate reputation as a miser and the much more recent styling as the Winter King in the early 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hollingshead|first=Iain|date=2013-05-30|title=Henry VII: Winter King, BBC Two, review|journal=Daily Telegraph|language=en-GB|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10089931/Henry-VII-Winter-King-BBC-Two-review.html|access-date=2020-05-15|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry understood the importance of pageantry to the establishment of a new dynasty.   He knew, in time, he had to open his wallet to impress foreign ambassadors as well, and thereby use &quot;soft power&quot; to impress the crowned heads of Spain and France and prove that he was not yet another English king that would be forced off the throne.  He would have needed Elizabeth as a source of how to set up a court properly,  as evidenced by the fact that when he wed his wife,  he had not seen England since he was fourteen years old whereas Elizabeth had been a princess living at court all her life until her father's death and would have been brought up understanding how to run a royal court. It is here that her influence was most likely felt along with her mother-in-law.    

As Henry's wife, and as Queen, Elizabeth's fate was heavily tied to the success of the new Tudor dynasty: this evidence lies in the fact that the throne had been unstable since before the birth of either Elizabeth or her nine-years-older husband and there was no way to be certain the couple would succeed at ending the feuding of a civil war that had lasted 32 years. One tactic involved marrying off Yorkists to Lancastrians.  Elizabeth's own sisters, [[Cecily of York|Cecily]]  and [[Anne of York (daughter of Edward IV)|Anne of York]], and her cousin, [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury|Margaret Pole]], were Yorkist brides married to Lancastrian men loyal to Henry.  Similar tactics had been used before by [[Richard III of England]], though in that case the Titulus Regius had marred the status of Elizabeth and all of her sisters as illegitimate bastards, and Richard had no intention of making it difficult for the two sides of the conflict to return to factionalism when two were married into one- his actions show he was more interested in loyalty and eliminating rival claims by wedding them off to the inconsequential.  Richard did this directly to Elizabeth's sister, Cecily, by wedding her to [[Richard Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton|Richard Scrope]].   Elizabeth, thus, had motive to want to see to the successful welfare of her female relatives, but by no means could she foresee if it would guarantee peace at last.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Henry VII and the House of York|url=https://henrytudorsociety.com/2017/04/23/henry-vii-and-the-house-of-york/|last=Society|first=Henry Tudor|date=2017-04-23|language=en|access-date=2020-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Loyalty had failed horribly for Richard. 

Further complicating things is that the public image of Henry Tudor that has been handed down through time only concurs with the last years of his reign.   Where, when, and how he spent his money is easily traceable by surviving documents, some written by the king himself and many more having his signature &quot;Henry R&quot; to indicate his oversight of entries, both his personal and the realms's finances, documented in every detail down to the last crumb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Domestic and foreign policy of Henry VII|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123%20202%20hvii%20policy.htm|date=2015-06-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627111129/http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123%20202%20hvii%20policy.htm|access-date=2020-05-15|archive-date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surviving in the British National Archives are letters written by Elizabeth of York and also a records of her privy purse, giving ample proof that the rumour regarding Henry's mistreatment of his wife is egregiously false. The truth is that Elizabeth was a very pious woman and one of her life passions was charity, one of the three [[theological virtues]] of the Catholic Church.  She  gave away money and alms in very  large quantities, to the point she indebted herself on many occasions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=42 Regal Facts About Elizabeth of York, The First Tudor Queen|url=https://www.factinate.com/people/facts-elizabeth-york-tudor-queen/|date=2019-03-26|website=Factinate|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   She also gave generously to monks and religious orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Elizabeth of York by Sarah Bryson|url=https://www.tudorsociety.com/elizabeth-york-sarah-bryson/|last=Ridgway|first=Author: Claire|date=2016-02-11|website=The Tudor Society|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the criticism regarding the reign of Elizabeth's husband derives from the sneers of the nobility of the age, understandably bitter about the recentralisation of power with the king in London, and the later viciously critical views of [[Francis Bacon]],  but evidence from the British National Archives along with more recent work in archaeology present a much different portrait where Elizabeth had a much more generous, kind, and doting husband in Henry Tudor in private.  Behind the scenes, the evidence reveals a man who opened the purse strings for his children, mother, and wife generously and actually had a penchant for music, merrymaking, and dance on specific special occasions and in spite of many enemies made at the climax of the [[Wars of the Roses]], there were still staunch supporters and friends of Henry, and that Elizabeth had won their trust.

The records state that [[Elsyng Palace]]  was  one of two nurseries for Henry and Elizabeth's children and they are both places where Elizabeth spent much of her time when not at court.  Within a year of the [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Battle of Bosworth]],  a friend of Henry Tudor, Thomas Lovell,  began expanding and improving upon the Elsyng  property to make it fit for Elizabeth, her husband, and her children-to-be, completed by the time of the birth of [[Henry VIII of England|Prince Henry]] with inner and outer courts and ample places to play for the royal children. This was largely done as a gift, but it was completed in the newer Renaissance style and in time was suitable enough for Henry and Elizabeth's grandchildren and proves it was a much loved refuge for the king and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Elsyng Palace: A Royal Tudor Nursery|url=https://thetudortravelguide.com/2019/10/12/elsyng-palace/|date=2019-10-12|website=The Tudor Travel Guide|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth received a grand coronation where she was carried on a royal barge down the Thames, and more recent evidence suggests that Henry VII was as much a builder as his son and granddaughter and that his wife shared that interest:  it is known now that Elizabeth had a hand in designing the former Greenwich Palace and that the Palace itself was well appointed for large scale entertaining.{{sfn|Okerlund|2009|pp=178-179}} Records are very clear that Christmas was a raucous and special time for the royal family on the whole, evidenced by many surviving documents depicting a particularly lively court having a marvelous time, with copious amounts of imported wine, great amounts of money spent upon roasted meats, and entertainers.  Henry also frequently bought gifts for Elizabeth and their children.{{sfn|Okerlund|2009|pp=136-140}} The account books kept by Henry himself are crystal clear that he spent a great deal of gold on expensive cloth for both himself, his wife, and his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/06/01/miserly-henry-vii-was-actually-a-shopaholic-who-spent-3-million/|title='Miserly' Henry VII was actually a shopaholic who spent £3 million on clothes|first=Sarah|last=Knapton|date=1 June 2016|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth of York did not exercise much political influence as queen due to her strong-minded mother-in-law Lady Margaret Beaufort, but she was reported to be gentle, kind, and generous to her relations, servants, and benefactors. One report does state that Henry VII chose to appoint Elizabeth's choice for a vacant Bishopric over his mother's choice, showing Henry's affection for, and willingness to listen to, Elizabeth.{{sfn|Okerlund|2009|p=136}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Winter king : Henry VII and the dawn of Tudor England|last=Penn, Thomas.|date=2012|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-9156-9|edition=1st Simon &amp; Schuster hardcover|location=New York|oclc=741542832|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/winterkinghenryv00penn}}&lt;/ref&gt; She seems to have had a love of books, patronising the English printer [[William Caxton]].{{sfn|Okerlund|2009|pp=140-142}} Elizabeth of York enjoyed music, dancing, and gambling; the last of these was a pastime she shared with her husband.

As queen, Elizabeth made arrangements for the education of her younger children, including the future Henry VIII.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Winter king : Henry VII and the dawn of Tudor England|last=Penn, Thomas.|date=2012|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-9156-9|edition=1st Simon &amp; Schuster hardcover|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/winterkinghenryv00penn/page/101 101-102]|oclc=741542832|url=https://archive.org/details/winterkinghenryv00penn/page/101}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also accompanied her husband on his diplomatic visit to Calais in 1500 to meet with [[Philip I of Castile]], and she corresponded with [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I of Castile]] before their children's marriage.{{sfn|Okerlund|2009|pp=146-148}}

On 14 November 1501, Elizabeth of York's 15-year-old son Arthur married [[Catherine of Aragon]], daughter of King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen Isabella I of Castile. The pair were sent to Ludlow Castle, the traditional residence of the Prince of Wales. Arthur died in April 1502. The news of Arthur's death caused Henry VII to break down in grief, as much in fear for his dynasty as in mourning for his son. Elizabeth comforted him, telling him that he was the only child of his mother but had survived to become king, that God had left him with a son and two daughters, and that they were both young enough to have more children. When she returned to her own chambers, however, Elizabeth herself broke down with grief. Her attendants sent for Henry who, in turn, comforted her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Okerlund|2009|pp=203–211}}; Agnes Strickland, Elizabeth Strickland: ''Lives of the Queens of England'' (1852)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Winter King, Henry VII and the Dawn of Tudor England'', Thomas Penn , p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henry VII|last=Chrimes, S.

== Death and aftermath ==
[[File:Elizabeth of york - funeral effigy.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth's painted wood funeral [[effigy]] (without clothes), 1503, [[Westminster Abbey]]]]
In 1502, Elizabeth of York became pregnant once more and spent her [[Estimated date of confinement|confinement period]] in the Tower of London. On 2 February 1503, she gave birth to a daughter, Katherine, but the child died a few days afterwards. Succumbing to a [[Postpartum infections|''post partum'' infection]], Elizabeth of York died on 11 February, her 37th birthday. Her family seems to have been devastated by her death and mourned her deeply. According to one biographer, the death of  Elizabeth &quot;broke the heart&quot; of her husband and &quot;shattered him.&quot; Another account says that  Henry Tudor &quot;privily departed to a solitary place and would no man should resort unto him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Winter king : Henry VII and the dawn of Tudor England|last=Penn, Thomas.|date=2012|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-9156-9|edition=1st Simon &amp; Schuster hardcover|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/winterkinghenryv00penn/page/95 95-97]|oclc=741542832|url=https://archive.org/details/winterkinghenryv00penn/page/95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henry VII|last=Chrimes, S.

For Henry Tudor to show his emotions, let alone any sign of infirmity, was highly unusual and alarming to members of his court.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Within a little over two years, King Henry VII lost his oldest son, his wife, his baby daughter, and found himself having to honour the [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace]]. 

[[File:Henry VII in Mourning.jpg|thumb|[[Presentation miniature]] from the ''Vaux Passional'']]
In 2012, the ''[[Vaux Passional]]'', an illuminated manuscript that was once the property of Henry VII, was rediscovered in the [[National Library of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.llgc.org.uk/discover/digital-gallery/digitalmirror-manuscripts/the-middle-ages/the-vaux-passional/|title=Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru - National Library of Wales: The Vaux Passional|date=8 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208023658/https://www.llgc.org.uk/discover/digital-gallery/digitalmirror-manuscripts/the-middle-ages/the-vaux-passional/|access-date=5 December 2019|archive-date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts the aftermath of Elizabeth's death vividly. Henry VII is shown receiving the book containing the manuscript in mourning robes with a doleful expression on his face. In the background, behind their father, are the late queen's daughters, Mary and Margaret, in black veils. The red head of 11-year-old Prince Henry is shown weeping into the sheets of his mother's empty bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elizabeth of York : a Tudor queen and her world|last=Weir, Alison, 1951-|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0-345-52137-8|edition=Ballantine books trade paperback|location=New York|pages=453|oclc=870981183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry VII entertained thoughts of remarriage to renew the alliance with Spain — [[Joanna of Naples (1478–1518)|Joanna, Dowager Queen of Naples]] (daughter of Ferdinand I of Naples), [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna, Queen of Castile]] (daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella), and [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret, Dowager Duchess of Savoy]] (sister-in-law of Joanna of Castile), were all considered &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bergenroth |first1=G A |title=Calendar of State Papers, Spain: Supplement To Volumes 1 and 2, Queen Katherine; Intended Marriage of King Henry VII To Queen Juana |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/spain/supp/vols1-2 |website=British History Online |accessdate=7 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; — but he died a widower in 1509.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henry VII|last=Chrimes, S.

Henry also continued to employ her minstrels each New Year.{{sfn|Okerlund|2009|p=210}}

The Tower of London was abandoned as a royal residence, as evidenced by the lack of records of its being used by the royal family after 1503. Royal births in the reign of Elizabeth's son, Henry VIII, took place in various other palaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdalicious.com.au/history/elizabeth-of-york-and-her-kings-henry-vii/|title=» Elizabeth of York and her Kings – Henry VII|work=Nerdalicious|date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry VII's reputation for [[miser]]liness became worse after Elizabeth's death.{{sfn|Okerlund|2009|p=220}}

He was buried with Elizabeth of York under their [[effigy|effigies]] in his Westminster Abbey chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henry VII|last=Chrimes, S. B.

== Appearance and legacy ==

According to folklore, the &quot;queen ... in the parlour&quot; in the children's nursery rhyme &quot;[[Sing a Song of Sixpence]]&quot; is Elizabeth of York, while her husband is the king counting his money. The symbol of the [[Tudor dynasty]] is the [[Tudor rose]], which became a royal symbol for England upon Elizabeth's marriage to Henry VII in 1486. Her [[White Rose of York]] is most commonly proper to her husband's [[Red Rose of Lancaster]] and today, uncrowned, is still the [[floral emblem]] of England.

Elizabeth of York was renowned as a great beauty for her time; with regular features, blue eyes, tall, and a fair complexion, inheriting many traits from her [[Edward IV of England|father]] and her mother Elizabeth Woodville, who was considered at one point the most beautiful woman in the British Isles.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; She inherited her father's propensity towards height as most women of her generation were considerably smaller than five feet six inches (168 cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Elizabeth of York, Queen of England|url=https://www.medievalists.net/2015/12/elizabeth-of-york-queen-of-england/|last=Medievalists.net|date=2015-12-12|website=Medievalists.net|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   All other Tudor monarchs inherited her reddish gold hair and the trait became synonymous with the dynasty.

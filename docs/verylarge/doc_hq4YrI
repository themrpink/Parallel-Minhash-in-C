Nonetheless, the [[Islamization]] and [[Arabization]] of the region was a complicated and lengthy process. Whereas nomadic Berbers were quick to convert and assist the Arab conquerors, it was not until the twelfth century, under the Almohad Dynasty, that the Christian, Jewish, and animist communities of the Maghreb became marginalized.

[[Maghrebi Jews|Jews]] persisted within Northern Africa as [[dhimmis]], protected peoples, under Islamic law. They continued to occupy prominent economic and political roles within the Maghreb.&lt;ref&gt;Trans-Saharan Africa in World History, Ch. 5, Ralph Austin&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some scholars believe that Jewish merchants may have crossed the Sahara, although others dispute this claim.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Indigenous Christian communities within the Maghreb all but disappeared under Islamic rule, although Christian communities from Europe may still be found in the Maghreb to this day.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The indigenous [[Christianity in Africa|Christian population]] in some [[Nefzaoua]] villages persisted until the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hrbek|first1=Ivan|title=Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh Century|date=1992|publisher=Unesco.

The first Arabian military expeditions into the Maghreb, between 642 and 669, resulted in the spread of Islam. These early forays from a base in Egypt occurred under local initiative rather than under orders from the central [[caliphate]]. But when the seat of the caliphate moved from Medina to Damascus, the [[Umayyads]] (a Muslim dynasty ruling from 661 to 750) recognized that the strategic necessity of dominating the Mediterranean dictated a concerted military effort on the North African front. In 670, therefore, an Arab army under [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] established the town of [[Kairouan|Qayrawan]] about 160 kilometres south of modern [[Tunis]] and used it as a base for further operations.

[[File:Statue of Dyhia in Khenchela (Algeria).jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of [[Kahina]], a seventh-century female Berber religious and military leader]]

[[Abu al-Muhajir Dinar]], Uqba's successor, pushed westward into Algeria and eventually worked out a modus vivendi with [[Kusaila]], the ruler of an extensive confederation of Christian Berbers. Kusaila, who had been based in [[Tlemcen]], became a Muslim and moved his headquarters to Takirwan, near Al Qayrawan. This harmony was short-lived; Arabian and Berber forces controlled the region in turn until 697. Umayyad forces [[Battle of Carthage (698)|conquered Carthage]] in 698, expelling the Byzantines, and in 703 decisively defeated Kahina's Berber coalition at the [[Battle of Tabarka]]. By 711, Umayyad forces helped by Berber converts to Islam had conquered all of North Africa. Governors appointed by the Umayyad caliphs ruled from [[Kairouan]], capital of the new wilaya (province) of Ifriqiya, which covered [[Tripolitania]] (the western part of modern Libya), Tunisia, and eastern Algeria.

The spread of Islam among the Berbers did not guarantee their support for the Arab-dominated caliphate due to the discriminatory attitude of the Arabs. The ruling Arabs alienated the Berbers by taxing them heavily, treating converts as second-class Muslims, and, worst of all, by enslaving them. As a result, widespread opposition took the form of [[Berber Revolt|open revolt]] in 739–740 under the banner of Ibadin Islam. The Ibadin had been fighting [[Umayyad]] rule in the East, and many Berbers were attracted by the sect's seemingly egalitarian precepts.

After the revolt, Ibadin established a number of theocratic tribal kingdoms, most of which had short and troubled histories. But others, like [[Sijilmasa]] and [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]], which straddled the principal trade routes, proved more viable and prospered. In 750, the Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads as Muslim rulers, moved the caliphate to Baghdad and reestablished caliphal authority in Ifriqiya, appointing [[Ibrahim ibn al Aghlab]] as governor in [[Kairouan]]. Though nominally serving at the caliph's pleasure, Al Aghlab and his successors, the [[Aghlabid]]s, ruled independently until 909, presiding over a court that became a center for learning and culture.

Just to the west of Aghlabid lands, [[Abd ar Rahman ibn Rustam]] ruled most of the central Maghreb from [[Tahert]], south-west of [[Algiers]]. The rulers of the [[Rustamid]] imamate (761–909), each an [[Ibadi]] [[imam]], were elected by leading citizens. The imams gained a reputation for honesty, piety, and justice. The court at Tahert was noted for its support of scholarship in mathematics, astronomy, astrology, theology, and law. The Rustamid imams failed, by choice or by neglect, to organize a reliable standing army. This important factor, accompanied by the dynasty's eventual collapse into decadence, opened the way for Tahert's demise under the assault of the [[Fatimids]].
The Muslim [[Mahdia]] was founded by the [[Fatimids]] under the [[Caliph]] [[Abdallah al-Mahdi]] in 921 and made the capital city of [[Ifriqiya]], by caliph Abdallah El Fatimi.&lt;ref name=TN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commune-mahdia.gov.tn/ENG/presentation_ville/histoire_de_la_ville.htm|title=Mahdia: Historical Background|publisher=Commune-mahdia.gov.tn|access-date=2012-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109154752/http://www.commune-mahdia.gov.tn/ENG/presentation_ville/histoire_de_la_ville.htm|archive-date=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was chosen as the capital because of its proximity to the sea, and the promontory on which an important military settlement had been since the time of the [[Phoenicians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lexic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexicorient.com/tunisia/mahdia.htm|title=MAHDIA:Finger pointing at the sea|publisher=Lexicorient.com|access-date=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fatimids established the Tunisian city of [[Mahdia]] and made it their capital city before conquering Egypt and building the city of [[Cairo]] in 969.

The Muslims who invaded the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 711 were mainly Berbers, and were led by a Berber, [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], though under the [[suzerainty]] of the Arab [[Caliph]] of [[Damascus]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] and his North African Viceroy, [[Musa ibn Nusayr]].&lt;ref name=Collins1994&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Arab Conquest of Spain, 710–797|date=1994|publisher=Blackwell|page=97|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to subsequent antagonism between Arabs and Berbers, and to the fact that most of the histories of al-Andalus were written from an Arab perspective, the Berber role is understated in the available sources.&lt;ref name=Collins1994/&gt; The biographical dictionary of [[Ibn Khallikan]] preserves the record of the Berber predominance in the invasion of 711, in the entry on [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]].&lt;ref name=Collins1994/&gt; A second mixed army of [[Arab]]s and Berbers came in 712 under Ibn Nusayr himself. They supposedly helped the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Abd ar-Rahman I]] in [[al-Andalus]], because his mother was a Berber.

Roger Collins suggests that if the forces that invaded the Iberian peninsula were predominantly Berber, it is because there were insufficient Arab forces in Africa to maintain control of Africa and attack Iberia at the same time.{{r|Collins1994|p=98}} Thus, although north Africa had only been conquered about a dozen years previously, the Arabs already employed forces of the defeated Berbers to carry out their next invasion.{{r|Collins1994|p=98}} This would explain the predominance of Berbers over Arabs in the initial invasion. In addition, Collins argues that Berber social organization made it possible for the Arabs to recruit entire tribal units into their armies, making the defeated Berbers excellent military auxiliaries.{{r|Collins1994|p=99}} The Berber forces in the invasion of Iberia came from [[Ifriqiya]] or as far away as [[Tripolitania]].&lt;ref name=Collins2014&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Caliphs and Kings: Spain, 796–1031|date=2014|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|page=9|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor [[Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani|As-Samh]] distributed land to the conquering forces, apparently by tribe, though it is difficult to determine from the few historical sources available.{{r|Collins1994|p=48–49}} It was at this time that the positions of Arabs and Berbers was regularized across the Iberian peninsula. Berbers were positioned in many of the most mountainous regions of Spain, such as the mountains of Granada, the [[Pyrenees]], and the mountains of [[Cantabria]] and Galicia. Roger Collins suggests this may be because some Berbers were familiar with mountain terrain, whereas the Arabs were not.{{r|Collins1994|p=49–50}} By the late 710s, there was a Berber governor in [[Leon, Spain|Leon]] or [[Gijon, Spain|Gijon]].{{r|Collins1994|p=149}} When [[Pelagius]] revolted in [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]], it was against a Berber governor. This revolt challenged As-Samh's plans to settle Berbers in the Galician and Cantabrian mountains, and by the middle of the eighth century it seems there was no more Berber presence in Galicia.{{r|Collins1994|p=49–50}} The expulsion of the Berber garrisons from central Asturias following the [[battle of Covadonga]] contributed to the eventual formation of the independent Asturian kingdom.{{r|Collins2014|p=63}}

Many Berbers were settled in what were then the frontier lands near [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Talavera de la Reina|Talavera]], and [[Merida, Spain|Mérida]].{{r|Collins1994|p=195}} [[Merida, Spain|Mérida]] became a major Berber stronghold in the eighth century.{{r|Collins1994|p=201}} The Berber garrison in Talavera would later be commanded by [[Amrus ibn Yusuf]] and involved in military operations against rebels in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in the late 700s and early 800s.{{r|Collins1994|p=210}} Berbers were also initially settled in the eastern Pyrenees and Catalonia.{{r|Collins1994|p=88–89, 195}} Berbers were not settled in the major cities of the south, and were generally kept in the frontier zones away from Cordoba.{{r|Collins1994|p=207}}

Roger Collins cites the work of Pierre Guichard to argue that Berber groups in Iberia retained their own distinctive social organization.{{r|Collins1994|p=90}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guichard|first1=Pierre|title=Tribus arabes et berbères en al-Andalus|date=1973|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guichard|first1=Pierre|title=Al-andalus: estructura antropológica de una sociedad islámica en occidente|date=1976|location=Barcelona|edition=Spanish translation of French original}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this traditional view of Arab and Berber culture in the Iberian peninsula, Berber society was highly impermeable to outside influences, whereas Arabs became assimilated and Hispanized.{{r|Collins1994|p=90}} Some support for the view that Berbers assimilated less comes from an excavation of an Islamic cemetery in northern Spain, which reveals that the Berbers accompanying the initial invasion brought their families with them from north Africa.&lt;ref name=Collins2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sénac|first1=Philippe|title=Villes et campagnes de Tarraconaise et d'al-Andalus (VIe-XIe siècle): la transition|date=2007|location=Toulouse|pages=114–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 731, the eastern Pyrenees were under the control of Berber forces garrisoned in the major towns under the command of [[Munuza|Munnuza]]. Munnuza attempted to lead a Berber uprising against the Arabs in Spain, citing mistreatment of Berbers by Arabic judges in north Africa. Munnuza made an alliance with [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudo]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]]. However, governor [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd ar-Rahman]] attacked Munnuza before he was ready, and besieging him, defeated him at [[Llivia|Cerdanya]]. Because of the alliance with Munnuza, Abd ar-Rahman wanted to punish Eudo, and his punitive expedition ended in the Arab defeat at [[Battle of Poitiers (732)|Poitiers]].{{r|Collins1994|p=88–90}}

By the time of the governor [[Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj|Uqba]], and possibly as early as 714, the city of [[Pamplona]] was occupied by a Berber garrison.{{r|Collins1994|p=205–206}} An eighth century cemetery has been discovered with 190 burials all according to Islamic custom, testifying to the presence of this garrison.{{r|Collins1994|p=205–206}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sénac|first1=Philippe|title=Villes et campagnes de Tarraconaise et d'al-Andalus (VIe-XIe siècle): la transition|date=2007|location=Toulouse|pages=97–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 798, however, Pamplona is recorded as being under a [[Banu Qasi]] governor, Mutarrif ibn Musa. Ibn Musa lost control of Pamplona to a popular uprising. In 806 Pamplona gave allegiance to the Franks, and in 824 became an independent [[Kingdom of Pamplona]]. These events put an end to the Berber garrison in Pamplona.{{r|Collins1994|p=206–208}}

[[Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam|Al-Hakam]] wrote that there was a major [[Berber revolt]] in north Africa in 740–741, led by [[Maysara al-Matghari|Masayra]]. The Chronicle of 754 calls these rebels Arures, which Collins translates as 'heretics', arguing it is a reference to the Berber rebels' [[Ibadi]] or [[Khariji]] sympathies.{{r|Collins1994|p=107}} After [[Charles Martel]] attacked Arab ally [[Maurontus]] at [[Marseille]] in 739, governor [[Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj|Uqba]] planned a punitive attack against the [[Franks]], but news of a Berber revolt in north Africa made him turn back when he reached [[Zaragoza]].{{r|Collins1994|p=92}} Instead, according to the [[Chronicle of 754]], Uqba carried out an attack against Berber fortresses in Africa. Initially these attacks were unsuccessful, but then Uqba destroyed the rebels, secured all the crossing points to Spain, and then returned to his governorship.{{r|Collins1994|p=105–106}}

Although Masayra was killed by his own followers, the revolt spread and the Berber rebels defeated three Arab armies.{{r|Collins1994|p=106–108}} After the defeat of the third army, which included elite units of Syrians commanded by [[Kulthum ibn Iyadh al-Kushayri|Kulthum]] and [[Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri|Balj]], the Berber revolt spread further. At this time, the Berber military colonies in Spain revolted.{{r|Collins1994|p=108}} At the same time, Uqba died and was replaced by [[Abd al-Malik ibn Katan al-Fihri|Ibn Qatan]]. By this time, the Berbers controlled most of the north of the Iberian peninsula, except for the Ebro valley, and were menacing Toledo. Ibn Qatan invited Balj and his Syrian troops, who were at that time in Ceuta, to cross to the Iberian peninsula to fight against the Berbers.{{r|Collins1994|p=109–110}}

The Berbers marched south in three columns, simultaneously attacking Toledo, Cordoba, and the ports on the Gibraltar Straits. However, Ibn Qatan's sons defeated the army of Toledo, the governor's forces defeated the attack on Cordoba, and Balj defeated the attack on the straits. After this, Balj seized power by marching on Cordoba and executing Ibn Qatan.{{r|Collins1994|p=108}} Collins points out that Balj's troops were away from Syria just when the Abbasid revolt against the Umayyads broke out, and this may have contributed to the fall of the Umayyad regime.{{r|Collins1994|p=121}}

In Africa, the Berbers acted under divided leadership. Their attack on [[Kairouan]] was defeated, and a new governor of Africa, [[Handhala ibn Safwan al-Kalbi|Hanzala ibn Safwan]], proceeded to defeat the rebels in Africa and then to impose peace between Balj's troops and the existing Andalusi Arabs.{{r|Collins1994|p=110–111}}

Roger Collins argues that the Great Berber revolt facilitated the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and altered the demographics of the Berber population in the Iberian peninsula, specifically contributing to the Berber departure from the northwest of the peninsula.{{r|Collins1994|p=150–151}} When the Arabs first invaded the peninsula, Berber groups were situated in the northwest. However, due to the Berber revolt the Umayyad governors were forced to protect their southern flank and were unable to mount offenses against the Asturians. Some presence of Berbers in the northwest may have been maintained at first, but after the 740s there is no more mention of the northwestern Berbers in the sources.{{r|Collins1994|p=150–151, 153–154}}

==== In al-Andalus during the Umayyad emirate ====
When the Umayyad dynasty was overthrown in 750, a grandson of [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Caliph Hisham]], [[Abd al-Rahman|Abd ar-Rahman]], escaped to north Africa.{{r|Collins1994|p=115}} Abd ar-Rahman hid among the Berbers of north Africa for five years. A persistent tradition states that this is because his mother was Berber.{{r|Collins1994|p=117–118}} Abd ar-Rahman first took refuge with the Nafsa Berbers, his mother's people. As the governor [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri|Ibn Habib]] was looking for him, he then fled to the more powerful Zenata Berber confederacy, who were enemies of Ibn Habib. Since the Zenata had been part of the initial invasion force of al-Andalus, and were still present in the Iberian peninsula, this gave Abd ar-Rahman a base of support in al-Andalus.{{r|Collins1994|p=119}} However, Abd ar-Rahman seems to have drawn most of his support from portions of [[Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri|Balj's]] army that were still loyal to the Umayyads.{{r|Collins1994|p=122–123}}{{r|Collins2014|p=8}}

After Abd ar-Rahman crossed to Spain in 756, he declared himself the legitimate Umayyad ruler of al-Andalus. The governor, [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Yusuf]], refused to submit. After losing an initial battle near Cordoba,{{r|Collins1994|p=124–125}} Yusuf fled to [[Merida, Spain|Mérida]], where he raised a large Berber army. With this army, Yusuf marched on Seville, but was defeated by forces loyal to Abd ar-Rahman. Yusuf fled to Toledo, and was either killed on the way or after reaching Toledo.{{r|Collins1994|p=132}} However, Yusuf's cousin Hisham ibn Urwa continued to resist Abd ar-Rahman from Toledo until 764{{r|Collins1994|p=133}} and the sons of Yusuf revolted again in 785. All these family members of Yusuf, members of the [[Fihrids|Fihri]] tribe, were very effective at obtaining support from Berbers in their revolts against the Umayyad regime.{{r|Collins1994|p=134}}

As [[emir]] of [[al-Andalus]], [[Abd ar-Rahman I]] faced persistent opposition from Berber groups, including the Zenata. Berbers provided much of [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Yusuf]]'s support in fighting against Abd ar-Rahman. In 774, Zenata Berbers were involved in a Yemeni revolt in the area of Seville.{{r|Collins1994|p=168}} Andalusi Berber [[Salih ibn Tarif]] declared himself a prophet and ruled the [[Bargawata]] in Morocco in the 770s.{{r|Collins1994|p=169}}

In 768, a [[Miknasa]] Berber named Shaqya ibn Abd al-Walid declared himself a [[Isma'ilism|Fatimid]] [[imam]], claiming descent from [[Fatimah]] and [[Ali]].{{r|Collins1994|p=168}} He is mainly known from the work of [[Ibn al-Athir]].{{r|Collins1994|p=170}}
According to Ibn al-Athir, Shaqya's revolt originated in the area of modern [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], an area of Spain that is highly mountainous and challenging to traverse. Shaqya first killed the Umayyad governor of the fortress of [[:ca:Santaver|Santaver]] (near Roman [[Ercavica]]), and subsequently ravaged the surrounding district of Coria. Abd ar-Rahman sent out armies to fight him in 769, 770, and 771, but Shaqya avoided them by moving into the mountains. In 772, Shaqya defeated an Umayyad force and killed the governor of the fortress of [[Medellín, Spain|Medellin]] by a ruse. He was besieged by Umayyads in 774, but the revolt near Seville forced the besieging troops to withdraw. In 775 a Berber garrison in Coria declared allegiance to Shaqya, but Abd ar-Rahman retook the town and chased the Berbers into the mountains. In 776 Shaqya resisted sieges to his two main fortresses at Santaver and Shebat'ran (near Toledo). In 777 Shaqya was betrayed and killed by his own followers, who sent his head to Abd ar-Rahman.{{r|Collins1994|p=170–171}}

Roger Collins notes that both modern historians and ancient Arab authors have had a tendency to portray Shaqya as a fanatic followed by credulous fanatics, and to argue that he was either self-deluded or fraudulent in his claim of Fatimid descent.{{r|Collins1994|p=169}} However, Collins considers him an example of the messianic leaders that were not uncommon among Berbers at that time and earlier. He compares Shaqya to [[Idris I]], a descendant of Ali accepted by the Zenata Berbers, who founded the Idrisid dynasty in 788, and to [[Salih ibn Tarif]], who ruled the [[Bargawata]] Berber in the 770s. He also compares these leaders to pre-Islamic leaders [[Dihya|Kahina]] and [[Kusaila|Kosayla]].{{r|Collins1994|p=169–170}}

In 788, [[Hisham I of Córdoba|Hisham]] succeeded [[Abd ar-Rahman]] as emir, but his brother Sulayman revolted. Sulayman fled to the Berber garrison of Valencia, where he held out for two years. Finally he came to terms with Hisham and went into exile in 790, together with other brothers of his who had rebelled with him.{{r|Collins1994|p=203, 208}} In north Africa, Sulayman and his brothers forged alliances with local Berbers, especially the [[Kharijite]] ruler of [[Tahert]]. After the death of [[Hisham I of Córdoba|Hisham I]] and the accession of [[Al-Hakam I|Al-Hakam]], the brothers challenged Al-Hakam for the succession. Abd Allah crossed over to Valencia first in 796, calling on the allegiance of the same Berber garrison that sheltered Sulayman years earlier.{{r|Collins2014|p=30}} Crossing to al-Andalus in 798, Sulayman based himself in Elvira (now [[Granada, Spain|Granada]]), [[Ecija]], and [[Jaén, Spain|Jaen]], apparently drawing support from the Berbers in these mountainous southern regions. Sulayman was defeated in battle in 800 and fled to the Berber stronghold in [[Merida, Spain|Mérida]], but was captured before reaching it and executed in Cordoba.{{r|Collins1994|p=208}}

In 797, the Berbers of [[Talavera de la Reina|Talavera]] played a major part in defeating a revolt against [[Al-Hakam I]] in Toledo.{{r|Collins2014|p=32}} A certain Ubayd Allah ibn Hamir rebelled in Toledo against Al-Hakam. Al-Hakam order [[Amrus ibn Yusuf]] to destroy the rebellion. Amrus was the commander of the Berbers in Talavera. Amrus negotiated in secret with the Banu Mahsa faction in Toledo, promising them the governorship if they betrayed ibn Hamir. The Banu Mahsa brought Ibn Hamir's head to Amrus in Talavera. However, there was a feud between the Banu Mahsa and the Berbers of Talavera. The Berbers of Talavera killed all the Banu Mahsa. Amrus sent the heads of the Banu Mahsa along with that of Ibn Hamir to Al-Hakam in Cordoba. The Toledo rebellion was sufficiently weakened that Amrus was able to enter Toledo and convince its inhabitants to submit.{{r|Collins2014|p=32–33}}

Roger Collins argues that unassimilated Berber garrisons in al-Andalus engaged in local vendettas and feuds, such as the conflict with the Banu Mahsa.{{r|Collins2014|p=33}} This was due to the limited power of the Umayyad emir's central authority. Collins states that &quot;the Berbers, despite being fellow Muslims, were despised by those who claimed Arab descent&quot;.{{r|Collins2014|p=33–34}} As well as having feuds with Arab factions, the Berbers sometimes had major conflicts with the local communities where they were stationed. In 794, the Berber garrison of [[Tarragona, Spain|Tarragona]] massacred the inhabitants of the city. Tarragona was uninhabited for seven years until the Frankish conquest of Barcelona led to its reoccupation.{{r|Collins2014|p=34}}

In 829, one of the leaders of the Toledo rebellion of 797, Hashim al-Darrab, who had been kept under arrest in Cordoba, escaped, returned to Toledo, and started another rebellion.{{r|Collins2014|p=40}} From Toledo, Hashim attacked the Berber garrisons of Santaver and Talavera, precisely those that had been involved in suppressing the Toledo rebellion a generation earlier. Hashim gained control of [[Calatrava la Vieja]], then a major fortress town, until 834. Hashim was killed in battle in 831, but his followers maintained the rebellion, and Berbers from Calatrava besieged Toledo in 835 and 836. The rebellion was finally ended in 837, when the emir's brother al-Walid became governor of Toledo.{{r|Collins2014|p=40}}

Throughout the ninth century, the Berber garrisons were one of the main military supports of the Umayyad regime.{{r|Collins2014|p=37}} Although they had caused numerous problems for [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], Collins suggests that by the reign of Al-Hakam, the Berber conflicts with Arabs and native Iberians meant that Berbers could only look to the Umayyad regime for support and patronage, developing solid ties of loyalty to the emirs. However, they were also difficult to control, and by the end of the ninth century the Berber frontier garrisons disappear from the sources. Collins says this might be because they migrated back to north Africa or gradually assimilated.{{r|Collins2014|p=37}}

A Berber leader named H'abiba led a rebellion around Algeciras in 850. Little is known of this rebellion other than its occurrence, and that it may have had a religious inspiration.{{r|Collins2014|p=42–43}}

Berber groups were involved in the rebellion of [[Umar ibn Hafsun]] from 880 to 915.{{r|Collins2014|p=121–122}} Ibn Hafsun rebelled in 880, was captured, then escaped in 883 to his base in Bobastro. There he formed an alliance with the Banu Rifa' tribe of Berbers, who had a stronghold in Alhama.{{r|Collins2014|p=122}} He then formed alliances with other local Berber clans, taking the towns of Osuna, Estepa, and Ecija in 889. He captured Jaen in 892.{{r|Collins2014|p=122}} He was only defeated in 915 by [[Abd ar-Rahman III]].{{r|Collins2014|p=125}}

==== In al-Andalus during the Umayyad caliphate ====
{{main|Caliphate of Córdoba}}
[[File:Calatrava la Vieja foso.jpg|thumb|Old fortress at [[Calatrava la Vieja]]. The site was used during the Muslim period from about 785 until the fall of the Caliphate of Cordova.]]

New waves of Berber settlers arrived in al-Andalus in the 10th century, brought in as mercenaries by [[Abd ar-Rahman III]] to help him in his campaigns to recover Umayyad authority in areas that had thrown off allegiance to the Umayyads during the reigns of the previous emirs.{{r|Collins2014|p=103, 131, 168}} These new Berbers &quot;lacked any familiarity with the pattern of relationships&quot; that had existed in al-Andalus in the 700s and 800s;{{r|Collins2014|p=103}} thus they were not involved in the same web of traditional conflicts and loyalties as the existing Berber garrisons.{{r|Collins2014|p=168}}

[[File:An old Amazigh (Berbère) room in Morocco.jpg|thumb|An old Amazigh room in [[Morocco]]]]
New frontier settlements were built for the Berber mercenaries who arrived in the 900s. Written sources state that some of Abd ar-Rahman's new Berber mercenaries were placed in [[Calatrava la Vieja|Calatrava]], which was refortified.{{r|Collins2014|p=168}} Another Berber settlement called [[:es:Vascos|Vascos]], west of Toledo, is not mentioned in the historical sources, but has been excavated archaeologically. It was a fortified town, had walls, and a separate fortress or alcazar. Two cemeteries have been discovered also. It was established in the 900s as a frontier town for Berbers, probably of the Nafza tribe. It was abandoned soon after the Castilian occupation of Toledo in 1085. The Berber inhabitants took all their possessions with them.{{r|Collins2014|p=169}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Izquierdo Bonito|first1=Ricardo|title=Excavaciones en la ciudad hispanomusulmana de Vascos (Navalmoralejo, Toledo.

In the 900s, the Umayyad caliphate faced a challenge from the [[Fatimids]] in North Africa. The Fatimid caliphate was founded by [[Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah]] after his disciples gained a large following among the [[Kutama]] Berbers in what is today eastern Algeria and western Tunisia. After taking the city of [[Kairouan]] and overthrowing the [[Aghlabids]] in 909, the Mahdi Ubayd Allah declared himself caliph, which represented a direct challenge to the Umayyad's own claim to the caliphate.{{r|Collins2014|p=169}} The Fatimids gained overlordship over the [[Idrisids]], then launched a conquest of the Maghreb. To counter the threat, the Umayyads crossed the straits to take over [[Ceuta]] in 931,{{r|Collins2014|p=171}} and actively formed alliances with Berber confederacies such as the Zenata and the Awraba. Rather than fighting each other directly, the competition of Fatimids and Umayyads played out as a competition for Berber allegiances. In turn, this provided a motivation for the further Islamic conversion of Berbers, many of whom, particularly farther south away from the Mediterranean, were still Christian and pagan.{{r|Collins2014|p=169–170}} In turn, this would contribute to the development of [[Almoravids]] and [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], which would have a major impact on al-Andalus and contribute to the end of the Umayyad caliphate.{{r|Collins2014|p=170}}

With the help of his new mercenary forces, which were mainly composed of recent Berber arrivals, Abd ar-Rahman launched a series of attacks on parts of the Iberian peninsula that had fallen away from Umayyad allegiance. In the 920s he campaigned against the areas that rebelled under [[Umar ibn Hafsun]] and still refused to submit. These he submitted in the 920s. He conquered [[Merida, Spain|Mérida]] in 928–929, Ceuta in 931, and Toledo in 932.{{r|Collins2014|p=171–172}} In 934 [[Abd ar-Rahman III]] began a campaign in the north against [[Ramiro II of León|Ramiro II]] of Leon and Muhammad ibn Hashim al-Tujibi, the governor of [[Zaragoza]]. According to [[Ibn Hayyan]], after inconclusively confronting al-Tujibi on the Ebro, Abd ar-Rahman briefly forced the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]] into submission, ravaged [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and [[Alava]], and met Ramiro II in an inconclusive battle.{{r|Collins2014|p=171–172}} From 935 to 937, Abd ar-Rahman confronted the Tujibids, defeating them in 937. In 939, Ramiro II defeated the combined Umayyad and Tujibid armies in the [[Battle of Simancas]].{{r|Collins2014|p=146–147}}

Umayyad influence in western North Africa spread through diplomacy rather than conquest.{{r|Collins2014|p=172}} The Umayyads sought out alliances with various Berber confederacies. These would declare loyalty to the Umayyad caliphate in opposition to the Fatimids. The Umayyads would send gifts including embroidered silk ceremonial cloaks. During this time, mints in cities on the Moroccan coast ([[Fes]], [[Sijilmasa]], [[Sfax]], and al-Nakur) occasionally issued coins with the names of Umayyad caliphs, showing the extent of Umayyad diplomatic influence.{{r|Collins2014|p=172}} The text of a letter of friendship from a Berber leader to the Umayyad caliph has been preserved in the work of [[ʿĪsā al-Rāzī|'Isa al-Razi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anales Palatinos del Califa de Córdoba al-Hakam II, por 'Isa ibn Ahmad al-Razi (360–364 H. = 971–975 J.C.)|date=1967|location=Madrid|pages=160–161|edition=Spanish translation by Emilio García Gómez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Abd ar-Rahman III]] tensions increased between the three distinct components of the Muslim community in al-Andalus: Berbers, [[Saqaliba]], and those of Arab or mixed Arab and Gothic descent.{{r|Collins2014|p=175}} Following Abd ar-Rahman's proclamation of the new [[Cordoba Caliphate|Umayyad caliphate]] in Cordoba, the Umayyads placed a great emphasis on the Umayyad membership of the [[Quraysh]] tribe.{{r|Collins2014|p=180}} This led to a fashion in Cordoba for claiming pure Arab ancestry as opposed to descent from freed slaves.{{r|Collins2014|p=181}} Claims of descent from [[Visigothic]] noble families also became common.{{r|Collins2014|p=181–182}} However, an &quot;immediately detrimental consequence of this acute consciousness of ancestry was the revival of ethnic disparagement, directed in particular against the Berbers and the Saqaliba&quot;.{{r|Collins2014|p=182}}

When the [[Fatimids]] moved their capital to Egypt in 969, they left north Africa in charge of viceroys from the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] clan of [[Sanhaja]] Berbers, who were Fatimid loyalists and enemies of the Zenata.{{r|Collins2014|p=170}} The Zirids in turn divided their territories, assigning some to the [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadid]] branch of the family to govern. The Hammadids became independent in 1014, with their capital at [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qal'at Beni-Hammad]]. With the withdrawal of the Fatimids to Egypt, however, the rivalry with the Umayyads decreased.{{r|Collins2014|p=170}}

Al-Hakam II sent [[Muhammad Ibn Abī ‘Āmir al-Manṣūr|Muhammad Ibn Abī ‘Āmir]] to north Africa in 973–974 to act as {{lang|ar-Latn|[[qadi]] al qudat}} to the Berber groups that had accepted Umayyad authority. Ibn Abī ‘Āmir was treasurer of the household of the caliph's wife and children, director of the mint at [[Madinat al-Zahra]], commander of the Cordoba police, and [[qadi]] of the frontier. During his time as qadi in north Africa, Ibn Abi Amir developed close ties with the North African Berbers.{{r|Collins2014|p=186}}

On the death of [[Al-Hakam II]], the heir [[Hisham II]] was underage, and the position of [[hajib]] was occupied by a Berber named al-Mushafi. However, general [[Ghālib ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān]] and Muhammad Ibn Abī ‘Āmir formed an alliance, and in 978 they overthrew al-Mushafi and his sons and other family members, who had received offices. Al-Mushafi was imprisoned for five years before being killed, and his family was stripped of property and titles.{{r|Collins2014|p=187}}
In 980, Ibn Abī ‘Āmir fell out with his ally Ghalib, and a civil war began.{{r|Collins2014|p=187–188}} Ibn Abi Amir called on the Berbers he had lived with in 973–974 to come help him.{{r|Collins2014|p=188}} His Berber ally Jafar ibn Hamdun crossed the straits with his army, whereas Ghalib allied with the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. These armies fought several battles, in the last one of which Ghalib was killed, bringing the civil war to an end. Ibn Abī ‘Āmir then took on the name {{lang|ar-Latn|al-Mansur}} ([[Almanzor]]) ('the victorious'), by which he is more commonly known.{{r|Collins2014|p=188}}

Having won the war, [[Almanzor|al-Mansur]] no longer needed his Berber ally Ibn Hamdun, who instead became a threat due to his substantial army. Ibn Hamdun was murdered in 983, having been made drunk at a feast held in his honor, then murdered as he departed.{{r|Collins2014|p=188}} According to [[Ibn Idhari]], his head and one hand were then presented in secret to al-Mansur.{{r|Collins2014|p=188}}

Employing large numbers of Berber and [[Saqaliba]] mercenaries, al-Mansur initiated a series of highly successful attacks on the Christian portions of the peninsula.{{r|Collins2014|p=191}} Among the most memorable campaigns were the sack of [[Barcelona]] in 985, the destruction of [[Leon, Spain|Leon]] in 988, the capture of Count [[Garcia Fernandez of Castile]] in 995, and the sack of [[Santiago de Compostela|Santiago]] in 997.{{r|Collins2014|p=191–192}} Al-Mansur died in 1002. He was succeeded as hajib by his son, [[Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar|Abd al-Malik]]. In 1008, Abd al-Malik died and was succeeded as hajib by his half-brother, Abd ar-Rahman, known as [[Sanchuelo]] because his mother was Navarrese.{{r|Collins2014|p=196}} Meanwhile, Hisham II remained caliph, though this had become a ceremonial position.

Considerable resentment arose in Cordoba against the increasing numbers of Berbers brought from north Africa by al-Mansur and his children Abd al-Malik and Sanchuelo.{{r|Collins2014|p=198}} It was said that Sanchuelo ordered anyone attending his court to wear Berber turbans, which Roger Collins suggests may not have been true, but shows that hostile anti-Berber propaganda was being used to discredit the sons of al-Mansur. In 1009, Sanchuelo had himself proclaimed Hisham II's successor, and then went on military campaign. However, while he was away a revolt took place. Sanchuelo's palace was sacked and his support fell away. As he marched back to Cordoba his own Berber mercenaries abandoned him.{{r|Collins2014|p=197–198}} Knowing the strength of ill feeling against them in Cordoba, they thought Sanchuelo would be unable to protect them and so they went elsewhere in order to survive and secure their own interests.{{r|Collins2014|p=198}} Sanchuelo was left with only a few followers, and was captured and killed in 1009. Hisham II abdicated and was replaced by [[Muhammad II al-Mahdi]].

Having abandoned Sanchuelo, the Berbers who had formed his army turned to another ambitious Umayyad, Sulayman, whom they supported. They obtained logistical support from Count [[Sancho Garcia of Castile]]. Marching on Cordoba, they defeated Saqaliba general Wadih and forced Muhammad II al-Mahdi to flee to Toledo. They then installed [[Sulayman ibn al-Hakam|Sulayman]] as caliph, and based themselves in the Madinat al-Zahra to avoid friction with the local population.{{r|Collins2014|p=198–199}} Wadih and al-Mahdi formed an alliance with the Counts of Barcelona and Urgell and marched back on Cordoba. They defeated Sulayman and the Berber forces in a [[Battle of Aqbat al-Bakr|battle near Cordoba]] in 1010. To avoid being destroyed, the Berbers left Cordoba and fled towards Algeciras.{{r|Collins2014|p=199}}

[[Muhammad II al-Mahdi|Al-Mahdi]] swore to exterminate the Berbers and pursued them. However, he was defeated in battle near Marbella. With Wadih, he fled back to Cordoba while his Catalan allies went home. The Berbers turned around and [[Siege of Córdoba (1013)|besieged Cordoba]]. Deciding that he was about to lose, Wadih overthrew al-Mahdi and sent his head to the Berbers, replacing him with [[Hisham II]].{{r|Collins2014|p=199}} However, the Berbers did not end the siege. They methodically destroyed Cordoba's suburbs, pinning the inhabitants inside the old Roman walls and destroying the Madinat al-Zahra. Wadih's allies killed him, and the Cordoba garrison surrendered with the expectation of amnesty. However, &quot;a massacre ensued in which the Berbers took revenge for many personal and collective injuries and permanently settled several feuds in the process&quot;.{{r|Collins2014|p=200}} The Berbers made [[Sulayman ibn al-Hakam|Sulayman]] caliph once again. [[Ibn Idhari]] said that the installation of Sulayman in 1013 was the moment when &quot;the rule of the Berbers began in Cordoba and that of the Umayyads ended, after it had existed for two hundred and sixty eight years and forty-three days&quot;.{{r|Collins2014|p=200}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibn Idhari|title=Histoire de l'Afrique du Nord et de l'Espagne musulmane intitulée Kitab al-Bayan al-Mughrib par Ibn 'Idhari al-Marrakushi et fragments de la chronique de 'Arib|date=1901|location=Algiers|pages=II, ah 403|edition=French translation by Edmond Fagnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In al-Andalus in the Taifa period ====
During the [[Taifa]] era, the petty kings came from a variety of ethnic groups; some—for instance the [[Zirid]] kings of [[Granada]]—were of Berber origin. The Taifa period ended when a Berber dynasty—the Moroccan [[Almoravid]]s—took over al-Andalus; they were succeeded by the [[Almohad]] dynasty of Morocco, during which time al-Andalus flourished.

After the fall of Cordoba in 1013, the [[Saqaliba]] fled from the city to secure their own fiefdoms. One group of Saqaliba seized [[Orihuela]] from its Berber garrison and took control of its entire region.{{r|Collins2014|p=201}}

In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), Lando is introduced as an old friend of [[Han Solo]]. Prior to the events of the film, Lando made a career as a gambler, con artist, playboy, mining engineer, businessman, and was the [[Ship-owner|owner]] of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' until losing the ship to Han in a bet. He has become the administrator of Cloud City on the gas planet [[Bespin]], and in the film, reluctantly betrays Han to [[Darth Vader]]. In ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), he helps rescue Han from [[Jabba the Hutt]] and becomes a general in the [[Rebel Alliance]] and leads the attack on the second [[Death Star]]. He is portrayed by [[Billy Dee Williams]] in the original trilogy, as well as ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]'' (2019), marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history.&lt;ref name=wild&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theportalist.com/billy-dee-williams-lando-episode-ix|title=Billy Dee Williams to Return as Lando in Star Wars: Episode IX|website=The Portalist|last=Wild|first=Allison|date=10 July 2018|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Glover]] portrayed a younger version of the character in the standalone  ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' (2018).&lt;ref name=&quot;GloverasLando&quot; /&gt; Lando also appears frequently in the [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]] of novels, comic books and video games, including [[The Adventures of Lando Calrissian|a series of ''Legends'' novels]].

The character has become one of the franchise's most popular, with Billy Dee Williams' performance receiving praise. Donald Glover's performance in ''Solo'' was also well received, being hailed as one of the film's highlights. Williams was nominated for the [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor]] twice for his performances in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi''.

==Appearances==
===Film===
Lando is portrayed by [[Billy Dee Williams]] in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'' (2019), and was played by [[Donald Glover]] in the film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' (2018).

====Original trilogy====
Lando Calrissian first appears in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' as the administrator of [[Bespin|Cloud City]], an old friend of [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), and the previous owner of Han's ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. When Han, [[Princess Leia]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]), [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]), and [[C-3PO]] ([[Anthony Daniels]]) arrive at Cloud City, Lando welcomes them as guests of honor - only to betray them to [[Darth Vader]] (portrayed by [[David Prowse]], voiced by [[James Earl Jones]]), who plans to use them as bait to ensnare [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]). Lando had reluctantly agreed to betray Han and company after Vader threatened to put Cloud City under the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]'s control if he refused. Lando allows Vader to freeze Han in [[carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] and give him to bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]]) ([[Jeremy Bulloch]]); when Vader takes Leia and Chewbacca prisoner, however, Lando's conscience gets the better of him and he helps them escape. In the ensuing evacuation of Cloud City, he helps them escape in the ''Falcon''. He later assists in rescuing Luke from the underside of Cloud City. Afterwards, he promises to help find Han.

In ''Return of the Jedi'', Lando goes undercover to help Luke rescue Han from crime lord [[Jabba the Hutt]]. During a battle with Jabba's henchmen, Han saves Lando from being devoured by the [[Sarlacc]]; Lando then helps Han and the others destroy Jabba's barge. For his heroics, he is made a general in the [[Rebel Alliance]]. Lando then takes the pilot chair in his old ship, the ''Millennium Falcon'', and leads the attack on the second [[Death Star]]. He leads the Rebel strike on the battle station, and personally destroys its power core, causing the station to explode. He then joins the other Rebels on [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] in celebrating their victory and the end of the Empire.

====Sequel trilogy====
Lando did not appear in the first film of the sequel trilogy, ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' (2015). According to Williams, the reason Lando did not return may have been that he did not fit into the storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Williams|first=Billy Dee|subject-link=Billy Dee Williams|interviewer=Dennis Pellegrom|title=Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian)|url= https://www.starwarsinterviews.com/original-trilogy/episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back/billy-dee-williams-lando-calrissian/ |date= December 2015|website= StarWarsInterviews.com|access-date= 23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His absence from the casting announcement caused the displeasure of some fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher|last=Hooton |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/star-wars-7-cast-where-is-lando-calrissian-9305934.html |title=Star Wars 7 cast: Where is Lando Calrissian? |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|date=30 April 2014 |accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lando was also absent from ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Agar|url=http://screenrant.com/star-wars-8-last-jedi-billy-dee-williams-lando/|title=Star Wars 8: Billy Dee Williams Will Not Appear|website=[[Screen Rant]]|publisher=Valnet, Inc.|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early development of the film, director [[Rian Johnson]] briefly considered bringing back Lando as the codebreaker that [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] members [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]] ([[John Boyega]]) and [[Rose Tico]] ([[Kelly Marie Tran]]) seek in the coastal city of Canto Bight, but Lando was finally written out of the film's script, with the codebreaker role ultimately going to [[Benicio del Toro]]'s character [[List of Star Wars characters#D|DJ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LandoVIII&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Butler|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/star-wars-last-jedi-cast-demand-jj-abrams-brings-back-lando-episode-9-exclusive-170003275.html|title='Star Wars: The Last Jedi' cast demand JJ Abrams brings back Lando for 'Episode 9' (exclusive)|website=[[Yahoo!]]|publisher=Oath Inc.|location=Sunnyvale, California|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lando finally reappeared in 2019's ''The Rise of Skywalker'', marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history.&lt;ref name=&quot;wild&quot; /&gt; In the backstory to the film, in the years of peace after the Galactic Civil War, Lando attempted to start a family, and his daughter was born. In the time they were together, he was a loving father, however when she was two years old, she vanished, kidnapped by unknown culprits. In time, it became clear that the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] was behind both her abduction and those of other children of former Rebel leaders.{{cn|date=October 2020}} After the tragedy of losing his daughter and his failure in a quest with Luke Skywalker to find answers about the growing darkness in the Force, Calrissian settled on the desert planet of Pasaana and adopted a life of solitude.

Lando first appears in ''The Rise of Skywalker'' on Pasaana, guiding [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]), [[Poe Dameron]] ([[Oscar Isaac]]), Finn, and Chewbacca toward a clue for the whereabouts of the [[Sith]] wayfinder. Poe asks Lando to aid the Resistance, but Lando refuses, saying he does not fly anymore, but sends his regards to Leia. Lando reappears much later in the film, upon Leia's death, and he tells a grieving Poe that he, Luke, Leia, and Han were similarly unprepared when they were fighting the Empire, but that they were able to succeed because they had each other. This inspires Poe to launch an offensive against the forces of the [[Sith|Sith Eternal]], with Lando traveling the galaxy to recruit Rebel veterans and other supporters of the Resistance's cause to help in the final battle. Just as the Resistance appears most overwhelmed in the battle, Lando, Chewbacca, and [[Wedge Antilles]] ([[Denis Lawson]]) arrive in the ''Millennium Falcon'' alongside a massive fleet of Resistance sympathizers, allies, and veterans, and they help to win the battle and the war. At the end of the film, as the galaxy is celebrating the Resistance's victory, [[Jannah (Star Wars)|Jannah]] ([[Naomi Ackie]]), a former stormtrooper, approaches Lando and says she does not know where she is from; he tells her that they will find out together.

====Anthology films====
[[Donald Glover]] portrays a young Lando Calrissian in ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'', which takes place before the original trilogy.&lt;ref name=&quot;GloverasLando&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/donald-glover-cast-as-young-lando-calrissian-in-upcoming-han-solo-star-wars-stand-alone-film|title=Donald Glover Cast as Young Lando Calrissian in Upcoming Han Solo Star Wars Stand-Alone Film|website=StarWars.com|date=21 October 2016|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/han-solo-film-casting-young-lando-calrissian-exclusive/|title='Han Solo' Film Casting Young Lando Calrissian (Exclusive)|website=[[The Wrap]]|last=Gonzalez|first=Umberto|date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glover had the opportunity to speak with Billy Dee Williams and seek his input. &quot;He said, 'Just be charming'.

Lando is introduced as a gambler and &quot;retired&quot; smuggler who owns a ship fast enough for Han ([[Alden Ehrenreich]]) and his associates to use in stealing a load of raw starship fuel. Han tries to win the ship (the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'') from him in a game of sabacc, but Lando cheats and cleans Han out. However, Lando agrees to join the team in exchange for a percentage of the profits from the mission. During the heist and subsequent escape, Lando is injured and his droid co-pilot L3-37 is irreparably damaged, but Han brings the ''Falcon'' to safety with help from L3's navigational database after he hotwires it into the ship's computer. Lando later takes the ''Falcon'' and abandons the team, but Han tracks him down and wins it from him in another game of sabacc, having stolen the card Lando had up his sleeve to let him cheat.

[[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] said, in a statement, that a film focusing on Lando Calrissian could happen, but it would not be a priority at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Julia|last=Alexander|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/16/17360502/lando-calrissian-donald-glover-star-wars-solo-spinoff|title=Lando Calrissian Star Wars spinoff could happen, says Lucasfilm president (update)|website=[[Polygon.com]]|date=16 May 2018|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===
Billy Dee Williams returned to the role in the ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' episodes &quot;Idiot's Array&quot; and &quot;The Siege of Lothal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwarsunderworld.com/2014/06/billy-dee-williams-confirms-his.html|title=Billy Dee Williams Confirms His Involvement In 'Star Wars Rebels'|publisher=Star Wars Underworld |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;Idiot's Array&quot;, Lando wins Chopper (voiced by [[Dave Filoni]]), the repair droid of the crew of the ''Ghost'', in a game of sabacc, forcing the crew to assist him with a dangerous smuggling run to get their droid back. The crew become Lando's reluctant business partners following the ordeal, leading to their first encounter with the crime boss Azmorigan (voiced by [[James Hong]]). In &quot;The Siege of Lothal&quot;, the crew of the ''Ghost'' approach Lando for help in getting off of Lothal, which is under Imperial occupation. He is also mentioned on occasion in various other episodes, becoming one of a couple of aliases employed by series protagonist [[Ezra Bridger]] (voiced by [[Taylor Gray]]).

===Video games===
Billy Dee Williams reprises his role as Lando Calrissian in various games, including as a playable character in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Battlefront II]]''. However, only the second is canonical to the storyline of the films, due to the first game not containing any kind of narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battlefront&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/battlefront/news/bespin-new-hero-deep-dive|title=Bespin - New Hero Deep Dive|date=20 June 2016|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===
Lando Calrissian is the lead character in ''Lando'', a five-issue miniseries published in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battlefront&quot; /&gt; Lando has a brief appearance in the comic miniseries ''[[Star Wars: Shattered Empire|Shattered Empire]]'' published by Marvel Comics in 2015. Lando is also the lead character in the comic ''Lando: Double or Nothing'', a five-issue miniseries released in 2018.

===Books===
The novel ''Star Wars: Last Shot'' reveals that between ''Return of the Jedi'' and ''The Force Awakens'', Lando is considering settling down with a Twi'lek girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|url=http://ew.com/books/2018/04/18/star-wars-han-and-lando-novel-last-shot-gets-personal-and-political/|title=Star Wars: Han and Lando novel Last Shot gets personal and political|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=18 April 2018|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Legends'' media===
''Legends'' novels, comics, and video games are not considered canonical to the films. With the 2012 acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]], most of the licensed ''Star Wars'' novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' were rebranded as ''Star Wars Legends'' and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-15/why-disney-blew-up-more-than-30-years-of-star-wars-canon|last=Hood |first=Bryan |title=Why Disney Blew Up More Than 30 Years of Star Wars Canon |work=Bloomberg |date=15 December 2015 |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SW Legends&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page |publisher=[[StarWars.com]] |date=25 April 2014 |accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SW Adult&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line |title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of ''Star Wars'' Adult Fiction line |publisher=StarWars.com |date=25 April 2014 |accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Star Wars'' comic book series released by [[Marvel Comics]] featured Lando as a prominent character following ''The Empire Strikes Back''. In the comic series, he has a crime lord nemesis named Drebble, and Lando frequently made use of his foil's name as a cover identity so that any animosity he generates while using the alias will be brought against the real Drebble, not Lando himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starwars.com/hyperspace/member/insideronline/91/indexp2.html Interview with Jo Duffy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210191923/http://www.starwars.com/hyperspace/member/insideronline/91/indexp2.html |date=10 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This eventually backfires when &quot;Drebble's&quot; exploits are recognized by the Rebellion and Lando - being the only person who knows of him - has to present the real Drebble with an award for his own activities.

Lando is a supporting character in ''Legends'' novels that took place after ''Return of the Jedi'' commonly depicted Lando as getting involved in a variety of entrepreneurial schemes, including Nomad City in [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[Thrawn trilogy]] and the Kessel Spice Mines in the works of [[Kevin J. Anderson]]. During ''[[The Corellian Trilogy]]'', Lando goes on a [[Star Wars galaxy|galaxy]]-wide hunt for a rich wife, ultimately marrying Tendra Risant. With his in-laws' money and his entrepreneurial abilities, he opens a mining facility on the outer rim planet of Dubrillion. In ''[[The New Jedi Order]]'' and beyond, Lando continues being a valuable ally and friend to the Skywalker/Solo family. In ''[[Fury (Star Wars novel)|Fury]]'', the seventh novel of the ''[[Legacy of the Force]]'' series, Lando announces to Han and Leia that he and Tendra are having a child.

Kevin J. Anderson stated that Lucasfilm toyed with the idea of killing off Lando, noting the character had run his course for Expanded Universe authors in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;dwolver&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Doug|last=McCausland|url=http://www.alternativenation.net/interview-star-wars-author-kevin-j-anderson-recounts-jedi-academy-trilogy-darksaber-tales-jedi/|title=Interview: Star Wars Author Kevin J.

====''The Lando Calrissian Adventures''====
'''''The Lando Calrissian Adventures''''' is a 1983 trilogy of [[science fiction]] novels by [[L. Neil Smith]]. Set in the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe, the novels chronicle Lando's smuggling days before the events of the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.
The series has been described as &quot;space [[Pulp magazine|pulp]]&quot;, and highlights the differences between Lando and Han Solo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theculturalgutter.com/science-fiction/in-a-galaxy-far-far-away.html |title=...

They were also among the last novels in the franchise until [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[Thrawn trilogy]] was released in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Garcia |first=Adam Lance |title='Star Wars' writer reveals original vision for the sequels and his thoughts on 'The Last Jedi' |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/star-wars-writer-reveals-original-vision-sequels-thoughts-last-jedi-102657824.html |website=Yahoo |accessdate=8 June 2019 |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The series was retroactively set ten years before the [[Star Wars (film)|original ''Star Wars'' film]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daley |first=Brian |title=The Han Solo Adventures |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-307-79548-9 |page=timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is brought into chronological context with the rest of the Expanded Universe in ''[[Rebel Dawn]] '' (1998), the final book of [[A. C. Crispin]]'s ''[[Han Solo Trilogy]]''.

The novelization of ''Solo: A Star Wars Story'' makes reference to the events of the first book as a previous adventure of Lando's, which he recounts while composing his autobiographical &quot;''Calrissian Chronicles''&quot;. He further estimates that it will be the first in a trilogy of his adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lando Calrissian: 7 Things You Need to Know from Solo: A Star Wars™ Story |url=https://www.dk.com/uk/article/lando-calrissian-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-solo-a-star-wars-story/ |website=DK |accessdate=2 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu''''' is the first novel in Smith's ''Lando Calrissian'' trilogy, published by Del Rey on 1 July 1983. It is noted as being more of a [[Psychedelic literature|psychedelic]] fantasy novel than hard science fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;io9&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitbrook |first=James |title=Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu Is One of the Weirdest Star Wars Stories Ever Told |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/lando-calrissian-and-the-mindharp-of-sharu-is-one-of-th-1825787629 |website=io9 |accessdate=17 June 2019 |date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book begins shortly after Lando wins the ''Millennium Falcon'' in a game of sabacc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ratcliffe |first=Amy |title=Han and Lando Books to Read Before SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY |url=https://nerdist.com/article/han-solo-lando-calrissian-star-wars-books-to-read/ |website=Nerdist |accessdate=8 June 2019 |date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a robot which must be picked up in the Rafa system. Upon the planet of Rafa IV, convicts are made to harvest mind-draining 
&quot;life-crystals&quot; which prolong the life of elite citizens. Lando is arrested and brought before the colony's corrupt governor and the sorcerer Rokur Gepta, who will let him keep his life and liberty if he can locate the legendary Mindharp of the ancient and long-lost Sharu civilization. The Mindharp is revealed to be kept inside a multidimensional [[pyramid]] with mind-altering properties, which provides a strange adventure for the daring Lando.&lt;ref name=&quot;io9&quot; /&gt;

'''''Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon''''' is the second novel in the trilogy, published on 1 October 1983. After selling a load of life-crystals, and accompanied by his droid Vuffi Raa, Lando attempts a career as an honest freighter captain. After some bad luck, he is soon nostalgic for his old trade. Fortunately, he is invited to a sabacc game on Oseon celebrating an event called Flamewind, but is followed by Rokur Gepta. After an explosion rocks the hull of the ''Falcon'', they safely land. During the sabacc game, Lando is distracted by the apparent sabotage of his ship, and is assaulted. He comes under trial for having a weapon, illegal on the planet. He is offered a smuggling deal as an alternative to execution.

'''''Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka''''' is the third novel, published on 1 December 1983. Nearly a year after Lando and Vuffi Raa have left the Oseon system, while traveling in deep space they encounter Lehesu, a vacuum-breathing creature. Able to establish communication, they find out he is also on an adventure away from his home, the ThonBoka nebula. A month later, Lando and Raa receive word that ThonBoka is under attack from the Imperial Centrality Navy. Lehesu's exploration of the Centrality apparently provoked the attack on his species. Lando and Raa rush to assist their friend.
The Imperial blockade makes Lando nervous, but he cons his way through the fleet. When the ''Millennium Falcon'' strays from its course and is ordered to return, they dump explosives and go into hyperspace to fake the ''Falcon''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s destruction. Meanwhile, Rokur Gepta forms an alliance with a confederate squadron. Lando and Raa reunite with Lehesu, and hear of a negotiation attempt which only results in an outbreak of battle. The vacuum-breathing creatures use their projection and hyperspace abilities to fool the Imperial Navy, which fires on its allied ships. As Vuffi Raa pilots the ''Falcon'', Lando engages the enemy in battle from the quad-gun in one of their last adventures before Raa is resummoned to his original programming.

====Video games====
Williams reprised his role as Lando in ''Legends'' videogame ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast]]''.
In ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', Calrissian is an unlockable playable character, having the characteristic of being able to [[Hand-kissing|kiss Leia's hand]] if she is nearby. Lando is also a playable character in the multiplayer aspect of the 2017 game ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars: Battlefront II]]''.

==Concept and creation==
===Development===
{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}
Actor [[Yaphet Kotto]] was an early choice for the role of Lando Calrissian, but chose to appear in the prison drama ''[[Brubaker]]'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Marc Shapiro|date=Jan 1992|title=Yaphet Kotto: Freddy Fighter|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|issue=5|pages=28–32|series=Horror Spectacular}}&lt;/ref&gt; In writing ''The Empire Strikes Back'', Lucas initially considered that Lando Calrissian was a [[cloning|clone]] from a planet of clones which caused the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] mentioned in the [[Star Wars (film)|original ''Star Wars'' film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bouzereau|first=Laurent|title=The Annotated Screenplays|date=1997|publisher=[[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]]|isbn=978-0-345-40981-2|location=New York City|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaminski|first=Michael|title=The Secret History of Star Wars|publisher=Legacy Books Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-9784652-3-0|edition=3.0|location=Kingston, Ontario, Canada|page=158|origyear=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portrayal===
''[[The Verge]]'' noted that despite Han Solo's first name being written as &quot;Han&quot; and franchise creator George Lucas also pronouncing the name as &quot;Han&quot; ({{IPA|hæn}}) off-screen, within the films most characters, including Luke Skywalker, pronounce it as &quot;Hahn&quot; ({{IPA|hɑn}}). ''The Verge'' also noted how Billy Dee Williams' Lando seems to be the only character to pronounce it as &quot;Han&quot; like Lucas, and that when, in ''The Empire Strikes Back'', Lando is choked by Chewbacca for betraying Han, Lando causes most other characters to shift to &quot;Han&quot;. In ''Solo: A Star Wars Story'', Glover decided to deliberately use &quot;Han&quot; instead of &quot;Hahn&quot; in order to honor the character's trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farokhmanesh|first=Megan|date=18 April 2018|title=Solo: A Star Wars Story reminds us that no one knows how to say Han’s name|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17252052/solo-a-star-wars-story-hans-mispronounce|website=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialogue in ''Solo'' suggests that Lando is sexually interested in men, women, and droids, including both Han and L3-37. When asked about a scene where L3 jokes about Lando's flirtatiousness towards Han, writer [[Lawrence Kasdan]] said, &quot;That is her personality. Maybe it means something, maybe it doesn't.&quot; Co-writer [[Jonathan Kasdan]] implies that Lando is [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], stating, &quot;There's a fluidity to Donald and Billy Dee's [portrayal of Lando's] sexuality ... I would have loved to have gotten a more explicitly LGBT character into this movie. I think it's time, certainly, for that, and I love the fluidity ― sort of the spectrum of sexuality that Donald appeals to and that droids are a part of. He doesn't make any hard and fast rules.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Bill|date=17 May 2018|title='Star Wars' Writer Confirms Lando’s Sexual Fluidity In 'Solo'|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lando-calrissian-sexual-fluidity-solo-star-wars_us_5af77d59e4b00d7e4c1b37a9|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=[[HuffPost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

According to Alyssa Rosenberg of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Lando is a &quot;fascinating and fraught part of the {{'}}''Star Wars''{{'}} legacy and the conversation around race in science fiction&quot;. She added that &quot;Lando's the only character in {{'}}''Star Wars''{{'}} with a truly comfortable sense of style.&quot; On his portrayal, she wrote, &quot;One of Williams's accomplishments in {{'}}''Empire''{{'}} and {{'}}''Return of the Jedi''{{'}} is how much he [feels] like an old-fashioned movie star in a futuristic setting without making the performance seem incongruous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alyssa|last=Rosenberg|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/11/13/star-wars-and-the-enduring-appeal-of-lando-calrissian/|title='Star Wars' and the enduring appeal of Lando Calrissian|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington DC|date=13 November 2015|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lando Calrissian was chosen as the 11th best ''Star Wars'' character by [[IGN]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 100 IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/star-wars-characters/11.html |title=Top 100 Star Wars Characters |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=San Francisco, California|accessdate=12 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817212026/http://uk.ign.com/star-wars-characters/11.html |archivedate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 12th best ''Star Wars'' hero by IGN's Jesse Schedeen,&lt;ref name=&quot;Star Wars Heroes IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Jesse|last=Schedeen|url=http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/898/898576p4.html |title=Top 25 Star Wars Heroes: Day 3  |date=13 August 2008 |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=San Francisco, California|accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also said that he was one of the characters he'd most like to see in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Players Wanted&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Jesse|last=Schedeen|url=http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/892/892418p1.html |title=Players Wanted: The Force Unleashed |date=21 July 2008 |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=San Francisco, California|accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Billy Dee Williams publicly admitted that he received backlash from children who were angered by Lando's betrayal of Han Solo in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.&lt;ref name=&quot;backlash&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Billy Dee Williams|series=Unsung Hollywood|serieslink=Unsung Hollywood|network=[[TV One (U.S. TV network)|TV One]]|date=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams felt that the situation would have been different if Lando had been played by a white actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;backlash&quot;/&gt; Williams wrote that &quot;Lando is not black or white, he's just Lando. Above and beyond the arguments or discussions of bygone eras, he is of the future.&quot;&lt;ref name=comic&gt;{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=Billy Dee|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898924803|title=Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=2015|isbn=978-0-7851-9367-8|location=New York|pages=4|oclc=898924803}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated,

{{Quote|text=The one thing I always find myself explaining is that Lando didn't betray Han and his friends. He was dealing, as best he could, with a situation that was presented to him by the Empire upon their arrival. One of the most amusing moments for me was that Lando decided to challenge Darth Vader (for about three seconds) until he realized that maybe he'd better back down and figure out another way to save his friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;comic&quot; /&gt;}}

Writing for ''The Verge'', Megan Farokhmanesh criticized Jonathan Kasdan's assertion that Lando is pansexual as &quot;a piss-poor shot at representation&quot;, and argued that Kasdan was conflating pansexuality with [[promiscuity]]. Farokhmanesh compared the assertion to [[J. K. Rowling]]'s statement that [[Albus Dumbledore]] is gay, despite none of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' books mentioning the character's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Megan|last=Farokhmanesh|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17366002/lando-calrissian-solo-a-star-wars-story|title=Lando Calrissian’s newfound 'pansexuality' is bullshit|website=[[The Verge]]|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, Billy Dee Williams criticized the decision as well, blaming ''Solo''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s underperformance at the box office on its focus on this &quot;topical&quot; issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lang|first=Nico|date=2019-12-09|title=Billy Dee Williams Is Not Here For Pansexual Lando Calrissian|url=https://www.out.com/film/2019/12/09/billy-dee-williams-not-here-pansexual-lando-calrissian|url-status=live|access-date=2020-10-07|website=Out|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boba Fett''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|oʊ|b|ə|_|ˈ|f|ɛ|t}}) is a fictional character in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise created by [[George Lucas]]. He is a [[Mandalorian]] armor-wearing [[bounty hunter]] featured in both the [[Star Wars Trilogy|original]] and [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel film trilogies]], but first appeared in the [[Star Wars canon|non-canonical]] ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' (1978), voiced by [[Don Francks]]. In the original trilogy, the character is a supporting [[antagonist]] and was mainly portrayed by [[Jeremy Bulloch]]. Notable for speaking very few words and never removing his helmet, Boba appears in both ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), under the employ of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), employed by the [[Crime boss|crime lord]] [[Jabba the Hutt]]. In ''Return of the Jedi'', he apparently meets his demise after falling into a [[sarlacc]] pit. Boba was later [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|retroactively added]] in the Special Edition of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'' released in 1997, making a non-speaking [[cameo appearance]]. In the prequel film ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), which reveals the character's origins as an unmodified [[Clone trooper|clone]] and adoptive son of the bounty hunter [[Jango Fett]], a younger Boba is portrayed by [[Daniel Logan]]. Boba accompanies his father throughout the film, and witnesses his death at the hands of [[Jedi master|Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu]].

During development of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', the character was originally conceived as a member of a group of white-armored &quot;[[Supersoldier|supercommandos]]&quot;, before the idea was scrapped in favor of a solitary bounty hunter; this concept later evolved into the Mandalorians, an [[ethnic group]] with strong warrior traditions originating from the planet Mandalore, who sport armor and helmets similar to Boba's. However, the character was never established as a Mandalorian, only his armor, which he inherited from Jango Fett and subsequently modified. Boba's armor incorporates various gadgets, including a [[Jet pack|jetpack]], [[flamethrower]], whipcord launcher, wrist laser, and vibroblades, which, combined with his skills in both armed and unarmed combat, have led to his nearly flawless streak of successful contracts and reputation as the best bounty hunter in the galaxy of his era. Boba is also a skilled pilot, and owns a spaceship called the ''[[Slave I]]'', previously used by his father. 

Aside from the films, the character appears in various canon and non-canon [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' media]], such as [[List of Star Wars books|books]], [[List of Star Wars comic books|comics]], [[List of Star Wars television series|television series]], and [[List of Star Wars video games|video games]], many of which depict him as an [[antihero]] rather than a villain, while exploring his backstory and various adventures, both before and after ''Return of the Jedi''. While Daniel Logan reprised his role as Boba Fett in the 2008 animated series, ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', various actors have voiced the character in his other appearances. [[Temuera Morrison]], who played Jango Fett in ''Attack of the Clones'', voiced Boba in several video games, and physically portrayed him in the second season of the live-action [[streaming television]] series, ''[[The Mandalorian]]''. The character quickly became a fan favorite despite his limited presence in the original trilogy, and is a widely recognized figure in [[popular culture]]. His popularity within the [[Star Wars fandom|''Star Wars'' fanbase]] has earned him a [[Cult following|cult status]].

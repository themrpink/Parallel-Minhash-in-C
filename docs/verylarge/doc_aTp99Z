==Conservation==
The main breeding grounds of the weakfish are in the near shore estuaries of the Chesapeake Bay. &quot;The most important habitat for the weakfish is the brackish waters of the Chesapeake bay&quot; (Gillum). This is where the vast majority of weakfish breed, to maintain a healthy population of weakfish these areas must be preserved. The weakfish experienced a crash that was recognized in 2009 as stated by John McMurray in the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, &quot;A 2009 stock assessment found that weakfish were badly depleted. The stock had reached an all-time low of 2.9 million pounds, far below the &quot;biomass threshold&quot; of 22.4 million pounds, which is what scientists would consider a healthy stock.  This is an astonishing drop, since the East Coast harvest in 1980 was 80 million pounds&quot; (McMurray). &lt;ref&gt;https://www.trcp.org/2013/10/07/whats-up-with-all-these-weakfish/&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural mortality of this species has increased since the mid 1990s from 0.16 to an average of 0.93 from 2007 to 2014 but the underlying cause is still unknown. Given the decline in SSB in excess of 60% over three generation lengths and the unknown driver of increasing natural mortality, this species is listed as Endangered A2b with an urgent need for additional research to determine the driver of increasing natural mortality.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/46104933/49226925&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current fishing regulations==
For the recreational angler, each individual state has its own size limit, possession limit, and season for targeting and collecting weakfish. For example, in the state of New Jersey, recreational anglers are allowed 1 fish that is greater than 13 inches at any time of the year as shown by the New Jersey Department of Environmental protection (NJ wildlife). Under Florida regulations weakfish are considered unregulated but there is a 100 lbs limit of unregulated fish per day.

The '''striped bass''' (''Morone saxatilis''), also called '''Atlantic striped bass''', '''striper''', '''linesider''', '''rock''' or '''rockfish''', is an [[anadromous]] [[Perciformes|perciform]] fish of the family [[Moronidae]] found primarily along the Atlantic coast of North America. It has also been widely introduced into inland recreational fisheries across the United States.  Striped bass found in the Gulf of Mexico are a separate strain referred to as Gulf Coast striped bass.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fws.gov/welaka/gulfcoaststripedbass.html Gulf Coast Striped Bass]. Welaka National Fish Hatchery. Fws.gov (September 16, 2009). Retrieved on 2016-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The striped bass is the [[List of U.S. state fish|state fish]] of [[Maryland]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[South Carolina]], and the state saltwater (marine) fish of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Virginia]], and [[New Hampshire]].

The history of the striped bass fishery in North America dates back to the Colonial period. Many written accounts by some of the first European settlers describe the immense abundance of striped bass, along with [[alewife (fish)|alewives]], traveling and spawning up most rivers in the coastal Northeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Little, Michael J 1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Little, Michael J.|year= 1995|title= A Report on the Historic Spawning Grounds of the Striped Bass, &quot;Morone Saxatilis&quot; |journal= Maine Naturalist |volume=3|issue=2|pages= 107–113|doi= 10.2307/3858211|jstor=3858211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphology and lifespan ==
The striped bass is a typical member of the family [[Moronidae]] in shape, having a streamlined, silvery body marked with longitudinal dark stripes running from behind the gills to the base of the tail. Common mature size is {{convert|20|to(-)|40|lb|kg|0}}. The largest specimen recorded was {{convert|124|lb|kg}}, netted in 1896. Striped bass are believed to live for up to 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{FishBase|genus=Morone|species=saxatilis |year=2007|month=March}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average size in length is {{convert|20|to(-)|35|in|cm|-1}} and approximately {{convert|5|to(-)|20|lb|kg|0}}.

==Distribution==
[[File:Researcher with striped bass.jpg|thumb|left|A researcher holding up a large striped bass]]

===Natural distribution===
Striped bass are native to the [[Atlantic]] coastline of [[North America]] from the [[St. Lawrence River]] into the Gulf of Mexico to approximately [[Louisiana]]. They are [[anadromous]] fish that migrate between fresh and salt water. Spawning takes place in fresh water.

===Introductions outside their natural range===
Striped bass have been [[Exotic species|introduced]] to the Pacific Coast of North America and into many of the large [[reservoir|reservoir impoundments]] across the United States by state game and fish commissions for the purposes of recreational fishing and as a predator to control populations of [[American gizzard shad|gizzard shad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkansasstripers.com/striped-bass-management-plan.htm Striped Bass Management Plan] retrieved on June 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fish.state.pa.us/pafish/fishhtms/chap21.htm|publisher=Pennsylvania State Fish &amp; Boat Commission|work=Gallery of Pennsylvania Fishes|title=Chapter 21: Temperate Basses|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705023207/http://www.fish.state.pa.us/pafish/fishhtms/chap21.htm|archive-date=July 5, 2011|access-date=June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=J.

Striped bass have also been introduced into waters in [[Ecuador]], [[Iran]], [[Latvia]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Turkey]], primarily for [[sport fishing]] and [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Environmental factors==
The [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] success of striped bass has been studied in the [[San Francisco Bay]]-Delta water system, with a finding that high [[total dissolved solids]] (TDS) reduce spawning. At levels as low as 200&amp;nbsp;mg/l TDS, an observable diminution of spawning productivity occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Engineers, California (1969). ''Final Report to the State of California, San Francisco Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Program'', State of California, Sacramento, CA&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in lakes, ponds, streams, and wetlands.

Though the population of striped bass was growing and repopulating in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, a study executed by the Wildlife and Fisheries Program at West Virginia University found that the rapid growth of the striped bass population was exerting a tremendous pressure on its prey (river herring, shad, and blueback herring). This pressure on their food source was putting their own population at risk due to the population of prey naturally not coming back to the same spawning areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hartman, K. J. |title=Population-level consumption by Atlantic coastal striped bass and the influence of population recovery upon prey communities|journal=Fisheries Management and Ecology|volume=10|issue=5|pages=281–288|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2400.2003.00365.x|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the striped bass was designated as a protected game fish in 2007, and executive agencies were directed to use existing legal authorities to prohibit the sale of striped bass caught in federal waters in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Executive Order 13449: Protection of Striped Bass and Red Drum Fish Populations | publisher = Office of the Federal Register | date = October 20, 2007 | url = https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2007.html#13449 | access-date = October 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the province of Quebec designated the striped bass population of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence]] as [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in 1996. Analysis of available data implicated [[overfishing]] and dredging in the disappearance. In 2002, a reintroduction program was successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Reintroduction of the striped bass into the St. Lawrence | publisher = Minister of the Environment|date=2008|edition=2nd |url=http://planstlaurent.qc.ca/fileadmin/site_documents/documents/PDFs_accessibles/Bar_raye_2008_e_FINAL_v1.0.pdf | access-date = May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Reproduction of striped bass - A historical first: spawning ground identified in Montmagny| publisher = Gouvernement du Québec, 2003-2012 | date = September 1, 2011 | url = http://www.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/english/press/press-release-detail.jsp?id=9270 | access-date = May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Striped bass spawn in fresh water, and although they have been successfully adapted to freshwater habitat, they naturally spend their adult lives in saltwater (i.e., they are [[anadromous]]). Four important bodies of water with breeding stocks of striped bass are: [[Chesapeake Bay]], [[Massachusetts Bay]]/[[Cape Cod]], [[Hudson River]], and [[Delaware River]]. Many of the rivers and tributaries that emptied into the Atlantic, had at one time, bred stock of striped bass. This occurred until the 1860s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Little, Michael J 1995&quot;/&gt;  One of the largest breeding areas is the Chesapeake Bay, where populations from Chesapeake and Delaware bays have intermingled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111228052734/http://www.chesapeakebay.net/striped_bass.htm Striped Bass ''Morone saxatilis'']. Chesapeake Bay Program&lt;/ref&gt;  The very few successful spawning populations of freshwater striped bass include [[Lake Texoma]], Lake Weiss (Coosa River), the [[Colorado River]] and its reservoirs downstream from and including [[Lake Powell]], and the [[Arkansas River]], as well as [[Lake Marion (South Carolina)]] that retained a landlocked breeding population when the dam was built; other freshwater fisheries must be restocked with hatchery-produced fish annually. Stocking of striped bass was discontinued at Lake Mead in 1973 once natural reproduction was verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilde, G. R.|author2=L.J.

==Hybrids with other bass==
Striped bass have also been hybridized with [[white bass]] to produce [[hybrid striped bass]] also known as wiper, whiterock bass, sunshine bass, palmetto bass, and Cherokee bass. These hybrids have been stocked in many freshwater areas across the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://dnr.state.il.us/fish/06/Striped_Bass_Hybrid_report.pdf|publisher=Illinois Department of Natural Resources|title=Status of the Striped Bass/Hybrid Bass Bass Fishery|date=March 2006|access-date=June 10, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070620034900/http://dnr.state.il.us/fish/06/Striped_Bass_Hybrid_report.pdf|archive-date=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fish.state.pa.us/pafish/fishhtms/chap21.htm#hybrdbs|publisher=Pennsylvania State Fish &amp; Boat Commission|work=Gallery of Pennsylvania Fishes|title=Chapter 21: Temperate Basses (Striped Bass Hybrid)|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110705023207/http://www.fish.state.pa.us/pafish/fishhtms/chap21.htm#hybrdbs|archive-date=July 5, 2011|access-date=June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fishing for striped bass ==
{{Main|Striped bass fishing}}
Striped bass are of significant value for [[sport fishing]], and have been introduced to many waterways outside their natural range. A variety of [[angling]] methods are used, including [[Troll (angling)|trolling]] and [[surf fishing|surf casting]]  with topwater lures a good pick for surf casting, as well as bait casting with live and dead bait. Striped bass will take a number of live and fresh baits, including [[Atlantic menhaden|bunker]], [[clams]], [[American eel|eel]]s, sandworms, [[herring]], [[Glycera (genus)|bloodworms]], [[mackerel]], and [[shad]], bluegills, worms, crayfish, bucktails jigs, and silver spoons.

The largest striped bass ever taken by angling was an 81.88-lb (37.14-kg) specimen taken from a boat in Long Island Sound, near the Outer Southwest Reef, off the coast of [[Westbrook, Connecticut]]. The all-tackle world record fish was taken by Gregory Myerson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldrecordstriper.com Greg Myerson's World Record Striper Official Website]. Worldrecordstriper.com. Retrieved on November 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; on the night of August 4, 2011. The fish took a drifted live eel bait, and fought for 20 minutes before being boated by Myerson. A second hook and leader was discovered in the fish's mouth when it was boated, indicating it had been previously hooked by another angler. The fish measured 54&quot; in length and had a girth of 36&quot;. The [[International Game Fish Association]] declared Myerson's catch the new all-tackle world record striped bass on October 19, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igfa.org/Records/Fish-Records.aspx?LC=ATR&amp;Fish=Bass%2C+striped IGFA all-tackle world record striped bass]. Igfa.org. Retrieved on November 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to now holding the All-Tackle record, Meyerson's catch also landed him the new [[IGFA]] men's 37-kg (80-lb) line class record for striped bass, which previously stood at 70&amp;nbsp;lb. The previous all-tackle world record fish was a 78.5-lb (35.6-kg) specimen taken in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] on September 21, 1982 by Albert McReynolds, who fought the fish from the beach for 1:20 after it took his Rebel artificial lure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=DiBenedetto, David |title=On the Run: An Angler's Journey Down the Striper Coast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nOeP_sCyFAgC|date=October 13, 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-187735-3|page= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recreational bag limits vary by state and province.

== Landlocked striped bass ==

Striped bass are an [[anadromous]] fish, so their upriver spawning migrations led some individuals to become &quot;landlocked&quot; during lake dam constructions. The first area where this was documented was at the Santee-Cooper River during the construction of the two dams that impounded Lakes Moultrie and Marion, and because of this, the state game fish of South Carolina is the striped bass.&lt;ref name=&quot;freshhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.southernstripes.com | title = History of Freshwater Striped Bass | access-date = March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, biologists came to believe that striped bass stayed in rivers for long periods of time, with some not returning to sea unless temperature changes forced migration. Once fishermen and biologists caught on to rising striped bass populations, many state natural resources departments started stocking striped bass in local lakes. Striped bass still continue to exhibit upstream migrations from freshwater lakes during the spawning period. Landlocked stripers have a hard time reproducing naturally, and one of the few and most successful rivers they have been documented reproducing successfully is the Coosa River in Alabama and Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aboutarticle&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fishing.about.com/library/weekly/ftales/bl001127.htm| title = Striped Bass in River Systems | access-date = March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 70.6-lb (32.0-kg) landlocked bass was caught in February 2013 by James Bramlett on the Warrior River in Alabama, a current world record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Word Record Landlocked Bass&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/05/the_boost_alabama_mans_world-r.html#incart_river_default.html | title = Word Record Landlocked Bass | date = May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fish had a length of {{convert|44|in|cm}} and a girth of {{convert|37.75|in|cm}}.

A self-sustaining population of striped bass also exist in [[Lake Texoma]], a brackish lake.

In Canada there are no landlocked striped bass, but a large number of bass overwinter in Grand Lake, Nova Scotia. They migrate out in early April into the Shubenacadie River to spawn. These bass also spawn in the Stewiacke River (a tributary of the Shubenacadie). The Shubenacadie River system is one of five known spawning areas in Canada for striped bass, with the others being the St. Lawerence River, Miramichi River, Saint John River, Annapolis River and Shubenacadie/Stewiacke Rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160114182240/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/species-especes/species-especes/stripedbass-Fundy-barraye-eng.htm Aquatic Species at Risk - Striped Bass (Bay of Fundy Population)]. Fisheries and Oceans Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The striped bass population declined to less than 5 million by 1982, but efforts by fishermen with throw back lengths for smaller striped bass and management programs to rebuild the stock proved successful, and in 2007, there were nearly 56 million fish, including all ages. Recreational anglers and commercial fisherman caught an unprecedented 3.8 million fish in 2006. The management of the species includes size limits, commercial quotas, and biological reference points for the health of the species.

The Atlantic coast-wide harvest of striped bass is managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (AMSFC). In October 2019, the AMSFC announced that the 2018 Benchmark Stock Assessment indicated that &quot;the resource is overfished and experiencing overfishing&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Berger|first=Tina|url=http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file/5dc071b0pr35AtlStripedBassAddVI_Approval.pdf|title=ASMFC Atlantic Striped Bass Board Approves Addendum VI|date=October 31, 2019|work=Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission NEWS RELEASE|access-date=April 29, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement has led to some Atlantic states declaring a closure on this year’s trophy Striper recreational fishing season.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;striped bass-overfished&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fishingbooker.com/blog/2019-striped-bass-fishing-season-closures/|title=The 2019 Striped Bass Fishing Season Closures: Explained|access-date=October 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to regulatory actions, another way to replenish and help repopulate the striped bass population is to reintroduce the species to original spawning grounds in coastal rivers and estuaries in the Northeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Little, Michael J 1995&quot; /&gt;

Striped bass has firm and flavorful flesh with a large flake.&lt;ref name=&quot;ProChef&quot;/&gt; The hybrid striped bass yields more meat, has a more fragile texture, and a blander flavor than wild striped bass.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McGee|first=Harold|title=On Food and Cooking: the Science and Lore of the Kitchen|date=2004|publisher=Scribner|location=[[New York, New York]]|isbn=978-0-684-80001-1|page=200|lccn=2004058999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fish has a mild and distinctive flavor. In recipes, it can be substituted for milder fish like cod, as well as for stronger fish like bluefish. Other fish can substitute it, including weakfish, tilefish, blackfish, small bluefish, catfish, salmon, swordfish, and shark. Striped bass is easily grilled in fillets, and is therefore popular in beach communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYSeafood&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Striped Bass|url=http://www.nyseafood.org/ordereze/Content/PageDetails.aspx?PageID=70|publisher=New York Seafood Council|access-date=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''muskellunge''' ''([https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Esox_masquinongy Esox masquinongy])'', often shortened to '''muskie''', '''musky''' or '''lunge''', is a [[species]] of large [[Fresh water|freshwater]] [[fish]] native to [[North America]]. It is the largest member of the [[Esox|pike]] family, [[Esocidae]].

==Origin of name==
The origin of the name muskellunge is from the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] words ''maashkinoozhe'' meaning great fish, ''maskinoše'' or ''mashkinonge'' meaning big pike and the [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] word ''maskinunga''.  The [[French Canadians|French Canadien]] word is either ''masquinongé'' or ''maskinongé''.  In [[English language|English]] before settling on the common name muskellunge, a variety of names were used including ''muskelunge'', ''muscallonge'', ''muskallonge'', ''milliganong'', ''maskinonge'', ''maskalonge'', ''muskinunge'' and ''masquenongez''.

==Description==
[[File:Great Lakes Muskie.jpg|thumb|right|A spotted muskellunge caught in [[Lake St. Clair]] during winter.]]
Muskellunge closely resemble other [[esocid]]s such as the [[northern pike]] and [[American pickerel]] in both appearance and behavior. Like the northern pike and other aggressive pikes, the body plan is typical of [[ambush predator]]s with an elongated body, flat head, and dorsal, pelvic, and anal [[Fish anatomy#Fins|fins]] set far back on the body. Muskellunge are typically {{convert|28|-|48|in|cm|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{convert|15|-|36|lb|kg|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Michigan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10364_18958-45684--,00.html|title=DNR - Muskellunge,  Esox masquinongy|website=Michigan.gov|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some have reached up to {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} and almost {{convert|70|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=fishbase&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Esox|species=masquinongy|year=2011|month=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to past references the muskellunge attains 8 feet (244&amp;nbsp;cm) in length; this, however, has never been confirmed and is based most likely on exaggerations. Martin Arthur Williamson caught a muskellunge with a weight of 61.25&amp;nbsp;lb (27.8&amp;nbsp;kg) in November 2000 on [[Georgian Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishing-worldrecords.com/scientificname/Esox%20masquinongy/show Martin Arthur Williamson - Muskellunge]&lt;/ref&gt; The fish are a light silver, brown, or green, with dark vertical stripes on the flank, which may tend to break up into spots. In some cases, markings may be absent altogether, especially in fish from [[Turbidity|turbid]] waters. This is in contrast to northern pike, which have dark bodies with light markings. A reliable method to distinguish the two similar species is by counting the [[Canal pore|sensory pores]] on the underside of the [[mandible]]. A muskie will have seven or more per side, while the northern pike never has more than six. The lobes of the caudal (tail) fin in muskellunge come to a sharper point, while those of northern pike are more generally rounded. In addition, unlike pike, muskies have no scales on the lower half of their [[operculum (fish)|opercula]].

The muskellunge is known by a wide variety of [[common names]], including [[Ohio]] muskellunge, [[Great Lakes]] muskellunge, barred muskellunge, [[Ohio River]] pike, [[Allegheny River]] pike, jack pike, unspotted muskellunge, and the [[Wisconsin]] muskellunge.

[[Angling|Anglers]] seek large muskies as trophies or for sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;OL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outdoorlife.com/blogs/gone-fishin/2014/03/muskellunge-how-cast-lures-baits|title=Tactics for Fishing Early-Season Muskies|last=Heiting|first=Steve|date=March 20, 2014|publisher=Outdoor Life Magazine|accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In places where muskie are not native, such as in Maine, anglers are encouraged not to release the fish back into the water because of their alleged negative impact on the populations of trout and other smaller fish species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eregulations.com/maine/fishing/illegal-fish-introductions/|title=Illegal Fish Introductions in Maine|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
Muskellunge are found in [[Oligotrophic lake|oligotrophic]] and [[mesotrophic lake]]s and large [[river]]s from northern [[Michigan]], northern [[Wisconsin]], and northern [[Minnesota]] through the Great Lakes region, north into [[Canada]], throughout most of the [[Saint Lawrence River|St Lawrence River]] drainage, and northward throughout the upper [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] valley, although the species also extends as far south as [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] in the [[Tennessee River]] valley. Also, a small population is found in the [[Broad River (South Carolina)|Broad River]] in [[South Carolina]]. Several North Georgia reservoirs also have healthy stocked populations of muskie. They are also found in the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] drainage of the [[Hudson Bay]] basin. Muskie were introduced to western [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] in the late 1960s and have now spread to many connecting waterways in northern [[Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=442557&amp;an=1|title=MUSKELLUNGE MANAGEMENT PLAN|website=Maine.gov|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pineview Reservoir in Utah is one of three Utah locations where the hybrid Tiger Muskellunge is found.

They prefer clear waters where they lurk along weed edges, rock outcrops, or other structures to rest. A fish forms two distinct home ranges in summer: a shallow range and a deeper one. The shallow range is generally much smaller than the deeper range due to shallow water heating up. A muskie continually patrols the ranges in search of available food in the appropriate conditions of water temperature.

==Diet==
Muskies are ambush predators who will swiftly bite their prey and then swallow it head first. Muskellunge are the top predator in any body of water where they occur and they will eat larger prey than most other freshwater fish.&lt;ref&gt;https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Esox_masquinongy/&lt;/ref&gt; They eat all varieties of fish present in their ecosystem (including other muskellunge), along with the occasional [[insect]],&lt;ref&gt;https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Esox_masquinongy/&lt;/ref&gt; [[muskrat]], [[rat]], [[mouse]],&lt;ref&gt;https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Esox_masquinongy/&lt;/ref&gt; [[frog]], or [[duck]]. They are capable of taking prey up to two-thirds of their body length due to their large stomachs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/documents/musky/MuskellungeFactSheet2012.pdf|title=Muskellunge (Esox masquinongy)|last1=Simonson|first1=Tim|website=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have even been reports of large muskellunge attacking small [[dogs]] and even humans, although most of these reports are greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Esox_masquinongy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Length and weight==
[[File:muskellunge weight length graph.jpg|thumb|250px|Graph showing weight-length relationship for muskellunge]]
As muskellunge grow longer they increase in weight, but the relationship between length and weight is not linear. The relationship between them can be expressed by a [[Power law|power-law equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;W = cL^b\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

The exponent b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c is a constant for each species. For muskellunge, b = 3.325, higher than for many common species, and c = 0.000089 pounds/inch³.&lt;ref&gt;R. O. Anderson and R. M. Neumann, Length, Weight, and Associated Structural Indices, in Fisheries Techniques, second edition, B.E. Murphy and D.W. Willis, eds., American Fisheries Society, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Game Fish Association]] (IGFA) the largest muskellunge on [[World record|record]] was [[Fishing|caught]] by Cal Johnson in [[Lac Courte Oreilles]] (recognized as Lake Courte Oreilles by the association), [[Hayward, Wisconsin|Hayward]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]] on July 24, 1949. The [[fish]] weighed 67&amp;nbsp;lbs 8 oz (30.61&amp;nbsp;kg) and was 60.25 in (153.035 cm) in length, and 33-34 in (83.82-86.36 cm) in girth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://igfa.org/igfa-world-records-search/?search_type=CommonNameSummary&amp;search_term_1=Muskellunge|title=IGFA World Records|publisher=International Game Fish Association|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caljohnson.net/CalWr.htm|title=Cal Johnson's World Record Catch|website=www.caljohnson.net|access-date=March 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.musky.com/Features/CalStory.htm|title=Cal Johnson's Own story|website=www.musky.com|access-date=March 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:Muskellunge USFWS.jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration of a Muskellunge]]
Muskellunge are sometimes [[gregarious]], forming small [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]] in distinct territories. They spawn in mid to late spring, somewhat later than northern pike, over shallow, vegetated areas. A rock or sand bottom is preferred for spawning so the eggs do not sink into the mud and suffocate. The males arrive first and attempt to establish dominance over a territory. Spawning may last from five to 10 days and occurs mainly at night. The eggs are negatively buoyant and slightly adhesive; they adhere to plants and the bottom of the lake. Soon afterward, they are abandoned by the adults. Those [[embryo]]s which are not eaten by fish, insects, or crayfish hatch within two weeks. The larvae live on [[Egg (biology)#Fish eggs|yolk]] until the mouth is fully developed, when they begin to feed on [[copepod]]s and other [[zooplankton]]. They soon begin to prey upon fish. Juveniles generally attain a length of {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} by November of their first year.

==Predators==
Adult muskellunge are [[apex predator]]s where they occur naturally. Only humans pose a threat to an adult but juveniles are consumed by other muskies, northern pike, [[Black bass|bass]], [[trout]], and occasionally birds of prey. The muskellunge's low reproductive rate and slow growth render populations highly vulnerable to [[overfishing]]. This has prompted some jurisdictions to institute [[Hatchery#Fish hatcheries|artificial propagation]] programs in an attempt to maintain otherwise unsustainably high rates of angling effort and [[habitat destruction]].

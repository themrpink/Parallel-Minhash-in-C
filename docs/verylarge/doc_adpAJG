At various times in its history, it has been known as County '''Tirconaill''', County '''Tirconnell''' or County '''Tyrconnell''' ({{lang-ga|Tír Chonaill}}). The former was used as its official name during 1922–1927.&lt;ref&gt;Renamed &quot;County Tirconaill&quot; 1922 by resolution of the county council.(''Place Name Confusion{{spaced ndash}}Donegal or Tirconaill'', The Irish Times, 24 April 1924). After historians and Gaelic scholars pointed out that the historic territory of Tirconaill did not include the whole county, the name Donegal was re-adopted in 1927 (''Back to &quot;Donegal&quot;'', The Irish Times, 22 November 1927).&lt;/ref&gt; This is in reference to both the old ''[[túath]]'' of [[Tyrconnell|Tír Chonaill]] and the [[Earl of Tyrconnell|earldom]] that succeeded it.

County Donegal was the home of the once mighty Clann Dálaigh, whose best known branch were the Clann Ó Domhnaill, better known in English as the [[O'Donnell dynasty]]. Until around 1600, the O'Donnells were one of Ireland's richest and most powerful native Irish ruling families. Within [[Ulster]], only the Uí Néill (known in English as the O'Neill Clan) of modern [[County Tyrone]] were more powerful. The O'Donnells were Ulster's second most powerful ''clan'' or ruling-family from the early 13th century through to the start of the 17th century. For several centuries the O'Donnells ruled [[Tyrconnell|Tír Chonaill]], a Gaelic kingdom in West Ulster that covered almost all of modern County Donegal. The head of the O'Donnell family had the titles ''An Ó Domhnaill'' (meaning ''The O'Donnell'' in English) and ''Rí Thír Chonaill'' (meaning ''King of Tír Chonaill'' in English). Based at [[Donegal Castle]] in ''Dún na nGall'' (modern [[Donegal (town)|Donegal]]), the O'Donnell ''Kings of Tír Chonaill'' were traditionally inaugurated at Doon Rock near [[Kilmacrennan]]. O'Donnell royal or chiefly power was finally ended in what was then the newly created County Donegal in September 1607, following the [[Flight of the Earls]] from near [[Rathmullan]]. The modern ''County Arms of Donegal'' (dating from the early 1970s) was influenced by the design of the old O'Donnell royal arms. The ''County Arms'' is the official [[coat of arms]] of both County Donegal and Donegal County Council.

The modern County Donegal was [[shire]]d&lt;ref name=&quot;Connolly2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Connolly|first=S.J.|title=The Oxford Companion to Irish History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW9LYgEACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969186-9|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; by order of the English Crown in 1585. The English authorities at [[Dublin Castle]] formed the new county by amalgamating the old Kingdom of Tír Chonaill with the old Lordship of [[Inishowen]]. However, although detachments of the [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Royal Irish Army]] were stationed there, the Dublin authorities were unable to establish control over Tír Chonaill and Inishowen until after the [[Siege of Kinsale|Battle of Kinsale]] in 1602. Full control over the new County Donegall was only achieved after the [[Flight of the Earls]] in September 1607. It was the centre of [[O'Doherty's Rebellion]] of 1608 with the key [[Battle of Kilmacrennan]] taking place there. The county was one of those 'planted' during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] from around 1610 onwards. What became the [[Derry|City of Derry]] was officially part of County Donegal up until 1610.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brian Lacy 1983&quot;/&gt;

County Donegal was one of the worst affected parts of Ulster during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the late 1840s in Ireland. Vast swathes of the county were devastated by this catastrophe, many areas becoming permanently depopulated. Vast numbers of County Donegal's people emigrated at this time, chiefly through [[Foyle Port]].
[[File:Doe Castle, Donegal.jpg|thumb|[[Doe Castle]], home of the Sweeney clan]]
The [[Partition of Ireland]] in the early 1920s had a massive direct impact on County Donegal. [[Partition (politics)|Partition]] cut the county off, economically and administratively, from Derry, which had acted for centuries as the county's main port, transport hub and financial centre. Derry, together with west [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], was henceforward in a new, different [[jurisdiction]] officially called [[Northern Ireland]]. Partition also meant that County Donegal was now almost entirely cut off from the rest of the jurisdiction in which it now found itself, the new [[dominion]] called the [[Irish Free State]], which in April 1949 became the [[Republic of Ireland]]. Only a few miles of the county is physically connected by land to the rest of the Republic. The existence of a border cutting Donegal off from her natural hinterlands in Derry City and West Tyrone greatly exacerbated the economic difficulties of the county after partition. The county's economy is particularly susceptible, just like that of Derry City, to the currency fluctuations of the [[Euro]] against [[Pound sterling|sterling]].

Added to all this, in the late 20th century County Donegal was adversely affected by [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. The county suffered several bombings and assassinations. In June 1987, [[Constable]] Samuel McClean, a Donegal man who was a serving member of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], was shot dead by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] at his family home near [[Drumkeen]]. In May 1991, the prominent [[Sinn Féin]] politician [[Councillor]] [[Eddie Fullerton]] was assassinated by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] at his home in [[Buncrana]]. This added further to the economic and social difficulties of the county. However, the greater economic and administrative integration following the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of April 1998 has been of benefit to the county.

It has been labelled the 'forgotten county' by its own politicians, owing to the perception that it is ignored by the [[Government of Ireland]], even in times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=County Donegal 'wiped off crisis HQ maps' – BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/uk-ireland/county-wiped-off-crisis-hq-maps-14774878.html|date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oceanfm.ie/news/2010/04/21/donegal-disappears-from-crisis-response-maps/ Donegal ‘disappears’ from crisis response maps].

The Donegal [[Gaeltacht]] (Irish-speaking area) is the second-largest in Ireland. The version of the [[Irish language]] spoken in County Donegal is [[Ulster Irish]].

Of the Gaeltacht population of 24,744 (16% of the county's total population), 17,132 say they can speak Irish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2011/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=GA&amp;Geog_Code=02#T3_300 Donegal Gaeltacht statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526060346/http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2011/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=GA&amp;Geog_Code=02 |date=26 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three Irish-speaking parishes: [[Gweedore]], [[The Rosses]] and [[Cloughaneely]]. Other Irish-speaking areas include [[Gaeltacht an Láir]]: [[Glencolmcille]], [[Fintown]], [[Fanad]] and [[Rosguill]], the islands of [[Arranmore]], [[Tory Island]] and [[Inishbofin, County Donegal|Inishbofin]]. Gweedore is the largest Irish-speaking parish, with over 5,000 inhabitants. All schools in the region use Irish as the language of instruction. One of the constituent colleges of [[NUI Galway]], [[Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge]], is based in [[Gweedore]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Government and politics==
[[File:Glenveagh Castle - geograph.org.uk - 395086.jpg|thumbnail|[[Glenveagh Castle]]]]
Donegal County Council (which has officially been in existence since 1899) has responsibility for local administration, and is headquartered at the [[County House, Lifford|County House]] in [[Lifford]]. Until 2014, there were also Town Councils in [[Letterkenny]], [[Bundoran]], [[Ballyshannon]] and [[Buncrana]].  The Town Councils were abolished in June 2014 when the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]] was implemented&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.act.2014.0001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and their functions were taken over by Donegal County Council. Elections to the County Council take place every five years. Thirty seven councillors are elected using the system of [[proportional representation]]-single transferable vote (STV). For the purpose of elections the county is divided into 5 [[Municipal district (Ireland)|Municipal Districts]] comprising the following local electoral areas: Donegal (6), [[Glenties]] (6), [[Inishowen]] (9), Letterkenny (10) and [[Stranorlar]] (6).

For general elections, the [[Donegal (Dáil constituency)|county-wide constituency]] elects five representatives to [[Dáil Éireann]]. For elections to the [[European Parliament]], the county is part of the [[Midlands–North-West (European Parliament constituency)|Midlands–North-West]] constituency.

Voters have a reputation nationally for being &quot;conservative and contrarian&quot;, the county having achieved prominence for having rejected the Fiscal Treaty in 2012 and both the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/donegal-says-yes-2101162-May2015/|title=Even Donegal voted YES in the marriage referendum|date=23 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224234950/http://www.thejournal.ie/donegal-says-yes-2101162-May2015/|archive-date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Donegal was the [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|only county]] in Ireland to vote against the repeal of the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment of the Constitution]] which had acknowledged the right to life of the unborn.

===Freedom of Donegal===
The Freedom of Donegal is an award that is given to people who have been recognised for outstanding achievements on behalf of the people and County Donegal. Such people include [[Daniel O'Donnell]], [[Phil Coulter]], [[Shay Given]], [[Packie Bonner]], [[Pat Crerand]], [[Seamus Coleman]] and the [[Clannad|Brennan family]].
In 2009 the members of the 28th [[Infantry]] [[Battalion]] of the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Irish Defence Forces]] were also awarded the [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of the County]] from [[Donegal County Council]] &quot;in recognition of their longstanding service to the County of Donegal&quot;.

==Access==
[[File:Donegal Carrickfin Airport - Terminal entrance - geograph.org.uk - 1174804.jpg|thumb|[[Donegal Airport]], which is located in [[The Rosses]] region]]
An extensive rail network used to exist throughout the county and was mainly operated by the [[County Donegal Railways Joint Committee]] and the [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway]] Company (known as the L. &amp; L.S.R. or the Lough Swilly Company for short). Unfortunately all these lines were laid to a 3-foot gauge where the connecting lines were all laid to the Irish standard gauge of {{RailGauge|1600mm}}.  This meant that all goods had to be transhipped at [[Derry]] and [[Strabane]].  Like all narrow gauge railways this became a major handicap after World War 1 when road transport began to seriously erode the railways goods traffic.

By 1953 the Lough Swilly had closed its entire railway system and become a bus and road haulage concern.  The County Donegal lasted until 1960 as it had largely dieselised its passenger trains by 1951. By the late 1950s major work was required to upgrade the track and the Irish Government was unwilling to supply the necessary funds, so 'the Wee Donegal', as it was affectionally known, was closed in 1960. The [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (the G.N.R.) also ran a line from [[Strabane]] through The Laggan, a district in the east of the county, along the [[River Foyle]] into Derry. However, the railway network within County Donegal was completely closed by 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.derryjournal.com/news/your-community/nostalgia/closure-of-derry-road-a-great-loss-to-ireland-1-3540020|title = Closure of the 'Derry Road' a great loss to Ireland – Derry Journal|access-date = 20 August 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131212190328/http://www.derryjournal.com/news/your-community/nostalgia/closure-of-derry-road-a-great-loss-to-ireland-1-3540020|archive-date = 12 December 2013|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the closest railway station to the county is [[Londonderry railway station|Waterside Station]] in the City of Derry, which is operated by [[NI Railways|Northern Ireland Railways]] (N.I.R.). Train services along the [[Belfast–Derry railway line]] run, via [[Coleraine railway station]], to [[Belfast Central railway station|Belfast Central]] and [[Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station|Belfast Great Victoria Street]] railway stations.

County Donegal is served by both [[Donegal Airport]], located at Carrickfinn in [[The Rosses]] in the west of the county, and by [[City of Derry Airport]], located at [[Eglinton, County Londonderry|Eglinton]] to the east. The nearest main international airport to the county is [[Belfast International Airport]] (popularly known as Aldergrove Airport), which is located to the east at [[Aldergrove, County Antrim|Aldergrove]], near [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim Town]], in [[County Antrim]], {{convert|92|km|abbr=on}} from Derry City and {{convert|127|km|abbr=on}} from Letterkenny.

==Culture==
[[File:Grianan of Aileach scenic view 01.png|thumb|left|The [[Iron Age]] fortress [[Grianan of Aileach]] ({{Irish place name|Grianán Ailigh}}).]]
The variant of the [[Irish language]] spoken in County Donegal shares many traits with [[Scottish Gaelic]]. The Irish spoken in the Donegal ''[[Gaeltacht]]'' (Irish-speaking area) is of the [[Ulster Irish|Ulster dialect]], while [[Inishowen]] (parts of which only became English-speaking in the early 20th century) used the East Ulster dialect. [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] is often spoken in both the [[River Finn (County Donegal)|Finn Valley]] and The Laggan district of East Donegal. Donegal Irish has a strong influence on learnt Irish across Ulster.

Like other areas on the western seaboard of Ireland, Donegal has a distinctive [[Donegal fiddle tradition|fiddle tradition]] which is of world renown. Donegal is also well known for its songs which have, like the instrumental music, a distinctive sound. Donegal musical artists such as the bands [[Clannad]], [[The Pattersons]], and [[Altan (band)|Altan]] and solo artist [[Enya]], have had international success with traditional or traditional flavoured music. Donegal music has also influenced people not originally from the county including folk and pop singers [[Paul Brady]] and [[Phil Coulter]]. Singer [[Daniel O'Donnell]] has become a popular ambassador for the county. [[Popular music]] is also common, the county's most acclaimed rock artist being the [[Ballyshannon]]-born [[Rory Gallagher]]. Other acts to come out of Donegal include folk-rock band [[Goats Don't Shave]], Eurovision contestant [[Mickey Joe Harte]] and indie rock group [[The Revs]]. In more recent years, bands such as in Their Thousands and Mojo Gogo have featured on the front page of ''[[Hot Press]]'' magazine.

County Donegal has a long literary tradition in both Irish and English. The Irish [[navvy]]-turned-novelist [[Patrick MacGill]], author of many books about the experiences of Irish migrant [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] labourers in [[Great Britain|Britain]] at around the start of the 20th century, such as ''The Rat Pit'' and the autobiographical ''Children of the Dead End'', is from the [[Glenties]] area. The MacGill Summer School in [[Glenties]] is named in his honour, and attracts national interest as a forum for the analysis of current affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macgillsummerschool.com/about/|title=About|date=n.d.|website=MacGill Summer School|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610161228/http://www.macgillsummerschool.com/about/|archive-date=10 June 2019|access-date=21 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist and socialist politician [[Peadar O'Donnell]] hailed from [[The Rosses]] in west Donegal. The poet [[William Allingham]] was also from Ballyshannon. Modern exponents include the [[Inishowen]] playwright and poet [[Frank McGuinness]] and the playwright [[Brian Friel]]. Many of Friel's plays are set in the fictional Donegal town of [[Ballybeg (fictional town)|Ballybeg]].

Authors in County Donegal have been creating works, like the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'', in Irish and [[Latin]] since the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The Irish philosopher [[John Toland]] was born in [[Inishowen]] in 1670. He was thought of as the original [[Freethought|freethinker]] by [[George Berkeley]]. Toland was also instrumental in the spread of freemasonry throughout [[Continental Europe]]. In modern Irish, Donegal has produced a number of (sometimes controversial), authors such as the brothers [[Séamus Ó Grianna]] and [[Seosamh Mac Grianna]] from [[The Rosses]] and the contemporary (and controversial) Irish-language poet [[Cathal Ó Searcaigh]] from [[Gortahork]] in Cloughaneely, and where he is known to locals as ''Gúrú na gCnoc'' &quot;Guru of the Hills&quot;.

County Donegal is known for its textiles, whose unique woolen blends are made of short threads with tiny bits of colour blended in for a heathered effect. Sometimes they are woven in a rustic herringbone format and other times in more of a box weave of varied colours. These weaves are known as [[donegal tweed]]s (with a small 'd') and are world renowned.

There is a sizeable minority of [[Ulster Protestants]] in County Donegal and many Donegal Protestants trace their ancestors to settlers who arrived during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] throughout the 17th century. The [[Church of Ireland]] is the largest Protestant denomination with [[Presbyterianism]] in second. The areas of Donegal with the highest percentage of Protestants are The Laggan area of East Donegal around [[Raphoe]], the [[River Finn (County Donegal)|Finn Valley]] and areas around Ramelton, Milford and Dunfanaghy – where their proportion reaches up to 30–45 percent. There is also a large Protestant population between Donegal Town and [[Ballyshannon]] in the south of the county. In absolute terms, [[Letterkenny]] has the largest number of Protestants (over 1000) and is the most Presbyterian town (among those settlements with more than 3000 people) in the [[Republic of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The [[Earagail Arts Festival]] is held within the county each July.

People from Donegal have also contributed to culture elsewhere. [[Francis Alison]] was one of the founders of the College of Philadelphia, which would later become the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marquis 1607-1896&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607–1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | location = Chicago | year = 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Makemie]] (originally from [[Ramelton]]) founded the Presbyterian Church in America. [[David Steele (minister)|David Steele]], from Upper Creevaugh, was a prominent [[Reformed Presbyterian churches|Reformed Presbyterian]], or [[Covenanter]], minister who emigrated to the United States in 1824. [[Charles Inglis (bishop)|Charles Inglis]], who was the first [[Church of England]] bishop of the [[Diocese of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island|Diocese of Nova Scotia]], was the third son of Archibald Inglis, the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] in [[Glencolmcille]].

The Donegal [[Gaeltacht]] (Irish-speaking district) also attracts young people to County Donegal each year during the school summer holidays. The three-week-long summer Gaeltacht courses give young Irish people from other parts of the country a chance to learn the Irish language and traditional Irish cultural traditions that are still prevalent in parts of Donegal. The Donegal Gaeltacht has traditionally been a very popular destination each summer for young people from [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailyedge.ie/gaeltacht-memories-970204-Jun2013/|title=8 things we all did in the Gaeltacht|last=Hyde|first=Fiona|work=The Daily Edge|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scuba diving is also very popular with a club being located in Donegal Town.

==Education==
Higher education within the county is provided by [[Letterkenny Institute of Technology]] (L.Y.I.T.; popularly known locally as 'the Regional'), established in the 1970s in [[Letterkenny]]. In addition, many young people from the county attend third-level institutions elsewhere in Ireland, especially in [[Derry]] and also at the [[Ulster University at Coleraine]] (U.U.C.), [[Ulster University]] at Jordanstown (U.U.J.), [[Queen's University Belfast]] ('Queen's'), and [[NUI Galway]]. Many Donegal students also attend the [[Limavady]] Campus of the [[North West Regional College]] (popularly known as Limavady Tech) and the [[Omagh College of Further Education]] of [[South West College]] (popularly known as Omagh Tech or Omagh College).

==Sport==
[[File:Clgghaothdobhair.jpg|thumb|[[Gaoth Dobhair]] GAA grounds.]]

===Gaelic football and hurling===
The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (G.A.A.) sport of [[Gaelic football]] is very popular in County Donegal. Donegal's inter-county football team have won the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] title twice (in 1992 and 2012) and the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] ten times. [[Donegal senior football team|Donegal]] emerged victorious from the [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]] on 23 September 2012 to take the [[Sam Maguire Cup]] for only the second time, with early goals from [[Michael Murphy (Gaelic footballer)|Michael Murphy]] and [[Colm McFadden]] setting up victory of 2–11 to 0–13 over [[Mayo senior football team|Mayo]]. In 2007, Donegal won only their second national title by winning the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]]. On 24 April 2011, Donegal added their third national title when they defeated [[Laois GAA|Laois]] to capture the National Football League Division Two, they added another Division Two title in 2019. There are 16 clubs in the [[Donegal Senior Football Championship]], with many others playing at a lower level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubgaa.ie/donegal/index.htm|title=Donegal Gaelic football and hurling Clubs|work=clubgaa.ie|access-date=25 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830133030/http://clubgaa.ie/donegal/index.htm|archive-date=30 August 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hurling]] (often called 'hurley' within County Donegal), handball and rounders are also played but are less widespread, as in other parts of western [[Ulster]]. The Donegal county senior hurling team won the [[Lory Meagher Cup 2011|Lory Meagher Cup]] in 2011 and the [[Nicky Rackard Cup]] in 2013.

===Rugby Union===

===Golf===
There are a number of golf courses such as [[Ballyliffin Golf Club]], located in the Inishowen peninsula. Other courses of note are Murvagh (located outside Donegal Town) and Rosapenna (Sandy Hills) located in Downings (near [[Carrigart]]). The Glashedy Links has been ranked 6th in a recent ranking taken by Golf Digest on the best courses in Ireland. The Old links was ranked 28th, Murvagh 36th and Sandy Hills 38th.

===Cricket===
[[Cricket]] is chiefly confined to The Laggan district and the Finn Valley in the east of the county. The town of [[Raphoe]] and the nearby village of [[St Johnston]], both in The Laggan, are the traditional strongholds of cricket within the county. The game is mainly played and followed by members of the [[Ulster Protestants]] of Co. Donegal. [[St Johnston Cricket Club]] play in the [[North West Senior League]], while Letterkenny Cricket Club play in the Derry Midweek League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McNulty |first1=Chris |title=Howzat!

Those thousands of New Yorkers weren’t just hungry for new food, but for new points-of-view. “When I first started, it was all about how can we attract people with an event that’s as affordable and diverse as possible,” says Night Market founder John Wang. “We’ve now been able to represent over 85 countries, and I’m constantly hearing examples of people branching out and trying things they’ve never heard of before.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Colonial and post-colonial history===
[[File:CatherineofBraganza1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Catherine of Braganza]], former Queen of England]]
European colonization brought [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom|English]] settlers, as a part of the [[New Netherland]] colony. First settlements occurred in 1635 followed by early colonizations at [[Maspeth, Queens|Maspeth]] in 1642 (ultimately unsuccessful),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nnp.org/vtour/regions/Long_Island/mespath.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913215602/http://www.nnp.org/vtour/regions/Long_Island/mespath.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 13, 2012 |title=A Virtual Tour of New Netherland }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vlissingen (now [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]]) in 1645.&lt;ref name=&quot;ellis-p54&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Epic of New York City |last=Ellis |first=Edward Robb |publisher=Old Town Books |year=1966 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early settlements included Newtown (now [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]]) in 1652 and [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] in 1655. However, these towns were mostly inhabited by English settlers from [[New England]] via eastern [[Long Island]] ([[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]]) subject to Dutch law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Scheltema |editor-first1=Gajus |editor-last2=Westerhuijs |editor-first2=Heleen |year=2011 |title=Exploring Historic Dutch New York |location=New York |publisher=Museum of the City of New York/Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-48637-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the capture of the colony by the English and its renaming as ''New York'' in 1664, the area (and all of Long Island) became known as [[Yorkshire County, Province of New York|Yorkshire]].

The [[Flushing Remonstrance]] signed by colonists in 1657 is considered a precursor to the [[United States Constitution]]'s provision on freedom of religion in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. The signers protested the Dutch colonial authorities' persecution of [[Quakers]] in what is today the borough of Queens.

Queens played a minor role in the [[American Revolution]], as compared to Brooklyn, where the [[Battle of Long Island]] was largely fought. Queens, like the rest of what became New York City and Long Island, remained under British occupation after the Battle of Long Island in 1776 and was occupied throughout most of the rest of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Under the [[Quartering Act]], British soldiers used, as [[barracks]], the public inns and uninhabited buildings belonging to Queens residents. Even though many residents opposed unannounced quartering, they supported the British crown. The quartering of soldiers in private homes, except in times of war, was banned by the [[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. [[Nathan Hale]] was captured by the British on the shore of [[Flushing Bay]] and [[Hanging|hanged]] in [[Manhattan]].

From 1683 until 1784, Queens County consisted of five towns: Flushing, [[Town of Hempstead, New York|Hempstead]], [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]], Newtown, and [[Town of Oyster Bay, New York|Oyster Bay]]. On April 6, 1784, a sixth town, the [[Town of North Hempstead, New York|Town of North Hempstead]], was formed through secession by the northern portions of the Town of Hempstead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyqueen2/History.htm |title=Geographic History of Queens County |first=Walter |last=Greenspan |accessdate=December 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.rays-place.com/ny/queens-towns.htm |title=Towns in Queens County, NY; From: Gazetteer of the State of New York |first=J.

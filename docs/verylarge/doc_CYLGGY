[[Ghee]] is clarified butter that has been heated to around 120&amp;nbsp;°C (250&amp;nbsp;°F) after the water evaporated, turning the milk solids brown. This process flavors the ghee, and also produces [[antioxidant]]s that help protect it from rancidity. Because of this, ghee can keep for six to eight months under normal conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=37}}

===Whey butter===

Cream may be separated (usually by a centrifugal separator) from [[whey]] instead of milk, as a [[byproduct]] of [[cheese]]-making. Whey butter may be made from whey cream. Whey cream and butter have a lower fat content and taste more salty, tangy and &quot;cheesy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/everything_is_in_butter/|title=Article on sweet cream, whey cream, and the butters they produce|work=Kosher|accessdate=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220100350/http://oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/everything_is_in_butter/#|archive-date=20 February 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also cheaper than &quot;sweet&quot; cream and butter.

==History==
[[File:ButterMakingPalestine1914.jpg|thumb|180px|upright|''Traditional butter-making in Palestine''. Ancient techniques were still practiced in the early 20th century. ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', March 1914.]]

The earliest butter would have been from [[sheep]] or [[goat]]'s milk; [[cattle]] are not thought to have been [[domestication|domesticated]] for another thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Dates from McGee p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; An ancient method of butter making, still used today in parts of [[Africa]] and the [[Near East]], involves a goat skin half filled with milk, and inflated with air before being sealed. The skin is then hung with ropes on a tripod of sticks, and rocked until the movement leads to the formation of butter.

In the [[Mediterranean climate]], unclarified butter spoils quickly, unlike [[cheese]], so it is not a practical method of preserving the nutrients of milk. The ancient Greeks and Romans seemed to have considered butter a food fit more for the northern [[barbarian]]s. A play by the Greek comic poet [[Anaxandrides]] refers to [[Thracians]] as ''boutyrophagoi'', &quot;butter-eaters&quot;.&lt;ref name=Dalby_65&gt;Dalby p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [[Pliny the Elder]] calls butter &quot;the most delicate of food among barbarous nations&quot; and goes on to describe its medicinal properties.&lt;ref&gt;Bostock and Riley translation. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137;query=chapter%3D%232043;layout=;loc=28.36|Book Book 28, chapter 35].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the physician [[Galen]] also described butter as a medicinal agent only.&lt;ref&gt;Galen. ''de aliment. facult.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian and linguist [[Andrew Dalby]] says most references to butter in ancient Near Eastern texts should more correctly be translated as [[ghee]]. Ghee is mentioned in the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] as a typical trade article around the first century CE [[Arabian Sea]], and Roman geographer [[Strabo]] describes it as a commodity of [[Arabia]] and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]].&lt;ref name=Dalby_65/&gt; In [[India]], ghee has been a symbol of purity and an offering to the gods—especially [[Agni]], the [[Hindu]] god of fire—for more than 3000 years; references to ghee's sacred nature appear numerous times in the ''[[Rigveda]]'', circa 1500–1200&amp;nbsp;BCE. The tale of the child [[Krishna]] stealing butter remains a popular children's story in India today. Since India's prehistory, ghee has been both a [[staple food]] and used for ceremonial purposes, such as fueling holy lamps and funeral pyres.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:MakingButter1499.jpg|thumb|left|160px|upright|Woman churning butter; ''Compost et Kalendrier des Bergères'', Paris 1499]]
In the cooler climates of northern Europe, people could store butter longer before it spoiled. [[Scandinavia]] has the oldest tradition in Europe of butter export trade, dating at least to the 12th century.&lt;ref name=WE&gt;Web Exhibits: Butter. [http://webexhibits.org/butter/history-firkins.html Ancient Firkins] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051021003815/http://webexhibits.org/butter/history-firkins.html# |date=21 October 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of Rome and through much of the [[Middle Ages]], butter was a common food across most of Europe—but had a low reputation, and so was consumed principally by [[peasant]]s. Butter slowly became more accepted by the upper class, notably when the early 16th century [[Roman Catholic Church]] allowed its consumption during [[Lent]]. Bread and butter became common fare among the [[middle class]] and the English, in particular, gained a reputation for their liberal use of melted butter as a sauce with meat and vegetables.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=33}}

In antiquity, butter was used for fuel in lamps, as a substitute for oil. The ''Butter Tower'' of [[Rouen Cathedral]] was erected in the early 16th century when Archbishop [[Georges d'Amboise]] authorized the burning of butter during 
Lent, instead of oil, which was scarce at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pantropheon or a History of Food and its Preparation in Ancient Times |last=Soyer |first=Alexis|year=1977|origyear=1853|publisher=Paddington Press |location=Wisbech, Cambs. |isbn=978-0-448-22976-8|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across northern Europe, butter was sometimes treated in a manner unheard-of today: it was packed into barrels ([[wikt:Special:Search/firkin|firkins]]) and buried in [[peat bog]]s, perhaps for years. Such &quot;[[bog butter]]&quot; would develop a strong flavor as it aged, but remain edible, in large part because of the unique cool, airless, [[antiseptic]] and [[acid]]ic environment of a peat bog. Firkins of such buried butter are a common archaeological find in Ireland; the [[National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology]] has some containing &quot;a grayish cheese-like substance, partially hardened, not much like butter, and quite free from putrefaction.&quot; The practice was most common in Ireland in the 11th–14th centuries; it ended entirely before the 19th century.&lt;ref name=WE/&gt;

===Industrialization===
Like Ireland, [[France]] became well known for its butter, particularly in [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]]. Butter consumption in London in the mid 1840s was estimated at 15,357 tons annually.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.III'', London (1847) Charles Knight, p.975.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s, butter had become so in demand in France that Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] offered prize money for an inexpensive substitute to supplement France's inadequate butter supplies. A [[Hippolyte Mège-Mouriés|French chemist]] claimed the prize with the invention of [[margarine]] in 1869. The first margarine was [[beef]] [[tallow]] flavored with milk and worked like butter; vegetable margarine followed after the development of [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] oils around 1900.

[[File:GustafDeLaval.jpg|thumb|upright|Gustaf de Laval's [[centrifuge|centrifugal]] cream separator sped up the butter-making process.]]
Until the 19th century, the vast majority of butter was made by hand, on farms. The first butter factories appeared in the United States in the early 1860s, after the successful introduction of [[cheese]] factories a decade earlier. In the late 1870s, the [[centrifuge|centrifugal]] [[cream separator]] was introduced, marketed most successfully by [[Sweden|Swedish]] engineer [[Gustav de Laval|Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Everett E. &quot;Europe's Contribution to the American Dairy Industry&quot;. ''The Journal of Economic History'', Volume 9, 1949. 72-84.&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatically sped up the butter-making process by eliminating the slow step of letting cream naturally rise to the top of milk. Initially, whole milk was shipped to the butter factories, and the cream separation took place there. Soon, though, cream-separation technology became small and inexpensive enough to introduce an additional efficiency: the separation was accomplished on the farm, and the cream alone shipped to the factory. By 1900, more than half the butter produced in the [[United States]] was factory made; [[Europe]] followed suit shortly after.

In 1920, [[Otto Frederick Hunziker|Otto Hunziker]] authored ''The Butter Industry, Prepared for Factory, School and Laboratory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Hunziker | first =O F | authorlink=Otto Frederick Hunziker | year =1920 | title =The Butter Industry, Prepared for Factory, School and Laboratory | publisher =author | location =LaGrange, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; a well-known text in the industry that enjoyed at least three editions (1920, 1927, 1940).

Butter also provided extra income to farm families. They used wood presses with carved decoration to press butter into pucks or small bricks to sell at nearby markets or general stores. The decoration identified the farm that produced the butter.  This practice continued until production was mechanized and butter was produced in less decorative stick form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Sarah Josepha Buell|title=Mrs. Hale's new cook book|url=https://archive.org/details/b28075195|year=1857}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, butter presses remain in use for decorative purposes.

Butter consumption declined in most western nations during the 20th century, mainly because of the rising popularity of [[margarine]], which is less expensive and, until recent years, was perceived as being healthier. In the United States, margarine consumption overtook butter during the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Web Exhibits: Butter.

==Packaging==
===United States===
In the United States, butter has traditionally been made into small, rectangular blocks by means of a pair of wooden butter paddles. It is usually produced in {{convert|4|oz|lb g|adj=on|frac=4}} sticks that are individually wrapped in waxed or foiled paper, and sold as a {{convert|1|lb}} package of 4 sticks. This practice is believed to have originated in 1907, when [[Swift and Company]] began packaging butter in this manner for mass distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;parker&quot;&gt;{{cite document

Due to historical differences in butter printers (machines that cut and package butter),&lt;ref name=&quot;cooksill&quot;/&gt; 4-ounce sticks are commonly produced in two different shapes:
* The dominant shape east of the Rocky Mountains is the Elgin, or Eastern-pack shape, named for a dairy in [[Elgin, Illinois]]. The sticks measure {{convert|4+3/4|x|1+1/4|x|1+1/4|in}} and are typically sold stacked two by two in elongated cube-shaped boxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooksill&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

Most butter dishes are designed for Elgin-style butter sticks.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooksill&quot;/&gt;

Butter stick wrappers are usually marked with divisions for {{convert|8|UStbsp}}, which is less than their actual volume: the Elgin-pack shape is {{cvt|7.42|cuin|UStbsp|disp=out}}&lt;!-- 7.42 cuin derived from above dimensions (4.75&quot; x 1.25&quot; x 1.25&quot;) --&gt;, while the Western-pack shape is {{cvt|7.31|cuin|UStbsp|disp=out}}&lt;!-- 7.31 cuin derived from above dimensions (3.25&quot; x 1.5&quot; x 1.5&quot;) --&gt;. The printing on unsalted (&quot;sweet&quot;) butter wrappers is typically red, while that for salted butter is typically blue.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

===Elsewhere===
Outside of the United States, the shape of butter packages is approximately the same, but the butter is measured for sale and cooking by mass (rather than by volume or unit/stick), and is sold in {{cvt|250|g}} and {{cvt|500|g}} packages. The wrapper is usually a foil and waxed-paper laminate. (The waxed paper is now a siliconised substitute, but is still referred to in some places as [[parchment]], from the wrapping used in past centuries; and the term 'parchment-wrapped' is still employed where the paper alone is used, without the foil laminate.)

Butter for commercial and industrial use is packaged in plastic buckets, tubs, or drums, in quantities and units suited to the local market.

The water acts as a seal to keep the butter fresh, and also keeps the butter from overheating in hot temperatures. This method lets butter sit on a countertop for several days without spoiling.

Butter has been considered indispensable in [[French cuisine]] since the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Robert Pitte, ''French Gastronomy: The History and Geography of a Passion'', {{isbn|0231124163}}, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Chefs and cooks have extolled its importance: [[Fernand Point]] said &quot;Donnez-moi du beurre, encore du beurre, toujours du beurre!&quot; 'Give me butter, more butter, still more butter!';&lt;ref name=&quot;belleret&quot;&gt;Robert Belleret, ''Paul Bocuse, l'épopée d'un chef'', 2019, {{isbn|2809825904}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2020}}  [[Julia Child]] said &quot;With enough butter, anything is good.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katie Armour, &quot;Top 20 Julia Child Quotes&quot;, ''Matchbook'', [https://www.matchbookmag.com/daily/47-top-20-julia-child-quotes April 15, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once butter is softened, [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s, or other flavoring agents can be mixed into it, producing what is called a ''compound butter'' or ''composite butter'' (sometimes also called ''composed butter''). Compound butters can be used as spreads, or cooled, sliced, and placed onto hot food to melt into a sauce. Sweetened compound butters can be served with [[dessert]]s; such [[hard sauce]]s are often flavored with [[distilled beverage|spirits]].

Melted butter plays an important role in the preparation of [[sauce]]s, notably in [[French cuisine]]. ''[[Beurre noisette]]'' (hazelnut butter) and ''[[Beurre noir]]'' (black butter) are sauces of melted butter cooked until the milk solids and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of [[vinegar]] or [[lemon juice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=36}} [[Hollandaise sauce|Hollandaise]] and [[bearnaise sauce|béarnaise]] sauces are [[emulsion]]s of [[egg (food)|egg yolk]] and melted butter; they are in essence [[mayonnaise]]s made with butter instead of oil. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are stabilized with the powerful [[emulsifiers]] in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the fat globule membranes—to form a stable emulsion on its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=635–636}} ''[[Beurre blanc]]'' (white butter) is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or [[wine]], forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. ''[[Beurre monté]]'' (prepared butter) is melted but still [[emulsion|emulsified]] butter; it lends its name to the practice of &quot;mounting&quot; a sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=632}}

In Poland, the [[butter lamb]] (''Baranek wielkanocny'') is a traditional addition to the Easter Meal for many Polish Catholics. Butter is shaped into a lamb either by hand or in a lamb-shaped mould. Butter is also used to make edible decorations to garnish other dishes.

Butter is used for [[sautéing]] and [[frying]], although its milk solids brown and burn above 150&amp;nbsp;°C (250&amp;nbsp;°F)—a rather low temperature for most applications. The [[smoke point]] of butterfat is around 200&amp;nbsp;°C (400&amp;nbsp;°F), so clarified butter or ghee is better suited to frying.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=37}} Ghee has always been a common frying medium in India, where many avoid other animal fats for cultural or religious reasons.

Butter fills several roles in [[baking]], where it is used in a similar manner as other solid fats like [[lard]], [[suet]], or [[shortening]], but has a flavor that may better complement sweet baked goods. Many [[cookie]] [[dough]]s and some [[cake]] [[batter (cooking)|batters]] are [[leavening agent|leavened]], at least in part, by [[creaming (food)|creaming]] butter and [[sugar]] together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies like [[shortbread]] may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. [[Pastry|Pastries]] like [[pie]] dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.

As butter is essentially just the milk fat, it contains only traces of [[lactose]], so moderate consumption of butter is not a problem for [[lactose intolerant]] people.&lt;ref&gt;From data here [http://www.gastro.net.au/diets/lactose.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224060911/http://www.gastro.net.au/diets/lactose.html# |date=24 December 2005 }}, one [[teaspoon]] of butter contains 0.03&amp;nbsp;grams of lactose; a cup of milk contains 400 times that amount.&lt;/ref&gt; People with [[milk allergy|milk allergies]] may still need to avoid butter, which contains enough of the allergy-causing proteins to cause reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Allergy Society of South Africa.

'''''The Star Beast''''' is a 1954 [[science fiction]] novel by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] about a high school senior who discovers that his [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] pet is more than it appears to be. The novel was originally serialised, somewhat abridged, in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' (May, June, July 1954) as ''Star Lummox'' and then published in hardcover as part of [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]] series of [[Heinlein juveniles]].

==Plot summary==

The novel is set in the future.  Earth has had interstellar spaceflight for centuries and has contact with numerous extraterrestrial species, which is handled by a department of the Earth government.  John Thomas Stuart XI, the teenage protagonist, lives in a small Rocky Mountain town, Westville, caring for Lummox, an extraterrestrial beast which he inherited from his great-grandfather who brought it home from an interstellar voyage.  The pet has learned how to speak, and has gradually grown from the size of a collie pup to a ridable behemoth—especially after consuming a used car. The childlike Lummox is perceived to be a neighborhood nuisance and, upon leaving the Stuart property one day, causes substantial property damage across the city of Westville. John's widowed mother wants him to get rid of it, and brings an action in the local court to have it destroyed.

Desperate to save his pet, John Thomas considers selling Lummox to a zoo. He rapidly changes his mind and runs away from home, riding into the nearby wilderness on Lummox's back. His girlfriend Betty Sorenson joins him and suggests bringing the beast back into town and hiding it in a neighbor's greenhouse. However, it is not easy to conceal such a large creature. Eventually, the court orders Lummox destroyed.  In an amusing scene Westville's officials try several methods to kill Lummox but fail, as his alien physiology appears to be virtually invulnerable to ordinary weapons or poisons, and Lummox does not even realize they are attempting to execute him.

Meanwhile, at the Earth government Department of Spacial Affairs,  Mr. Kiku, an experienced diplomat, is dealing with the Hroshii, a previously unknown alien race, advanced and powerful, which appear in the solar system and demand the return of their lost child, or they will destroy Earth. A friendly alien diplomat of a third species intimates that the threat is not an empty one. Initially, no one associates Lummox with the newcomers, in part due to the size difference (Lummox was overfed). Lummox is finally identified as important royalty of the Hroshii, as well as approximately female (the Hroshii have six sexes).  It turns out that the relationship between John Thomas and Lummox is the only thing that saves Earth from destruction.  From her viewpoint, during her centuries on Earth the young but extremely long-lived Lummox has been pursuing a hobby: the raising of John Thomases. She makes it clear to the other Hroshii that she intends to continue doing so. This gives Mr. Kiku, the chief negotiator, the leverage he needs to establish diplomatic relations with the aliens, who normally do not hold regular relations with other species. At the insistence of Lummox, the newly married John and Betty accompany her back to the Hroshii homeworld as part of the human diplomatic mission.

Many of science fiction's triumphs, even from as little as ten years ago, are unreadable today; they were shoddily put together, not meant for re-use. But Heinlein is durable.

{{Update|section|date=January 2018}}
All paperback editions and the [[Science Fiction Book Club]] hard cover edition{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} omit page 148 of Chapter VIII, &quot;The Sensible Thing to Do&quot;, which was in the [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]] edition and the magazine serialization{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}. In this chapter, John Thomas rereads the entries in his great-grandfather's diary of how Lummox was found. Of significance on the omitted page is that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The diary skipped a couple of days; the ''Trail Blazer'' had made an emergency raise-ship and Assistant Powerman J. T. Stuart had been too busy to write. John Thomas knew why ... the negotiations opened so hopefully with the dominant race had failed ... no one knew why.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

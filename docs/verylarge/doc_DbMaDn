Byrd also contributed eight keyboard pieces to ''Parthenia'' (winter 1612–13), a collection of 21 keyboard pieces engraved by [[William Hole (engraver)|William Hole]], and containing music by Byrd, [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]] and [[Orlando Gibbons]]. It was issued in celebration of the forthcoming marriage of James I's daughter [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]] to [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], which took place on 14 February 1613. The three composers are nicely differentiated by seniority, with Byrd, Bull and Gibbons represented respectively by eight, seven and six items. Byrd's contribution includes the famous ''Earle of Salisbury Pavan'', composed in memory of [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], who had died on 24 May 1612, and its two accompanying galliards. Byrd's last published compositions are four English anthems printed in Sir [[William Leighton]]'s ''Teares or Lamentacions of a Sorrowfull Soule'' (1614).

Byrd remained in [[Stondon Massey]] until his death on 4 July 1623, which was noted in the Chapel Royal Check Book in a unique entry describing him as &quot;a Father of Musick&quot;. Despite repeated citations for recusancy and persistent heavy fines, he died a rich man, having rooms at the time of his death at the London home of the Earl of Worcester.

==Reputation and reception==
Byrd's output of about 470 compositions amply justifies his reputation as one of the great masters of European Renaissance music. Perhaps his most impressive achievement as a composer was his ability to transform so many of the main musical forms of his day and stamp them with his own identity. Having grown up in an age in which Latin polyphony was largely confined to liturgical items for the Sarum rite, he assimilated and mastered the Continental motet form of his day, employing a highly personal synthesis of English and continental models. He virtually created the Tudor consort and keyboard fantasia, having only the most primitive models to follow. He also raised the consort song, the church anthem and the Anglican service setting to new heights. Finally, despite a general aversion to the madrigal, he succeeded in cultivating secular vocal music in an impressive variety of forms in his three sets of 1588, 1589 and 1611.

Byrd enjoyed a high reputation among English musicians.  As early as 1575 Richard Mulcaster and Ferdinand Haybourne praised Byrd, together with Tallis, in poems published in the Tallis/Byrd ''Cantiones''.  Despite the financial failure of the publication,  some of his other collections sold well, while Elizabethan scribes such as the [[Oxford]] academic [[Robert Dow (music copyist)|Robert Dow]], the Windsor lay clerk [[John Baldwin (composer)|John Baldwin]], and a school of scribes working for the Norfolk country gentleman [[Edward Paston|Sir Edward Paston]] copied his music extensively. Dow included Latin [[distich]]s and quotations in praise of Byrd in his manuscript collection of music, the [[Dow Partbooks]] (GB Och 984–988), while Baldwin included a long doggerel poem in his Commonplace Book (GB Lbm Roy App 24 d 2) ranking Byrd at the head of the musicians of his day:

:Yet let not straingers bragg, nor they these soe commende,
:For they may now geve place and sett themselves behynde,
:An Englishman, by name, William BIRDE for his skill
:Which I shoulde heve sett first, for soe it was my will,
:Whose greater skill and knowledge dothe excelle all at this time
:And far to strange countries abrode his skill dothe shyne...&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boyd|1962|pages=81–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1597 Byrd's pupil Thomas Morley dedicated his treatise ''A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke'' to Byrd in flattering terms, though he may have intended to counterbalance this in the main text by some sharply satirical references to a mysterious &quot;Master Bold&quot;. In ''The Compleat Gentleman'' (1622) [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]] (1576–1643) praised Byrd in lavish terms as a composer of sacred music:

:&quot;For Motets and musick of piety and devotion, as well as for the honour of our Nation, as the merit of the man, I prefer above all our Phoenix M[aster] William Byrd, whom in that kind, I know not whether any may equall, I am sure none excel, even by the judgement of France and Italy, who are very sparing in the commendation of strangers, in regard of that conceipt they hold of themselves. His Cantiones Sacrae, as also his Gradualia, are mere Angelicall and Divine; and being of himself naturally disposed to Gravity and Piety, his vein is not so much for leight Madrigals or Canzonets, yet his Virginella and some others in his first Set, cannot be mended by the best Italian of them all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boyd|1962|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, and most intriguingly, it has been suggested that a reference to &quot;the bird of loudest lay&quot; in [[Shakespeare]]'s mysterious allegorical poem ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]]'' may be to the composer. The poem as a whole has been interpreted as an elegy for the Catholic martyr St [[Anne Line]], who was executed at Tyburn on 27 February 1601 for harbouring priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finnis|first1=J|last2=Martin|first2=P|title=Another Turn for the Turtle: Shakespeare's Intercession for Love's Martyr|journal=Times Literary Supplement|date=18 April 2003|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrd was an active and influential teacher.  As well as Morley, his pupils included [[Peter Philips]],  [[Thomas Tomkins]] and probably [[Thomas Weelkes]],  the first two of whom were important contributors to the Elizabethan and Jacobean virginalist school.  However, by the time Byrd died in 1623 the English musical landscape was undergoing profound changes.   The principal virginalist composers died off in the 1620s (except for  [[Giles Farnaby]], who died in 1640, and Thomas Tomkins, who lived on until 1656) and found no real successors. Thomas Morley, Byrd's other major composing pupil, devoted himself to the cultivation of the madrigal, a form in which Byrd himself took little interest. The native tradition of Latin music which Byrd had done so much to keep alive more or less died with him, while consort music underwent a huge change of character at the hands of a brilliant new generation of professional musicians at the Jacobean and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] courts. The Civil War, and the change of taste brought about by the Restoration, created a cultural hiatus which adversely affected the cultivation of Byrd's music together with that of Tudor composers in general.   In a small way, it was his Anglican church music which came closest to establishing a continuous tradition, at least in the sense that some of it continued to be performed in choral foundations after the Restoration and into the eighteenth century. Byrd's exceptionally long lifespan meant that he lived into an age in which many of the forms of vocal and instrumental music which he had made his own were beginning to lose their appeal to most musicians. Despite the efforts of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century antiquarians, the reversal of this judgement had to wait for the pioneering work of twentieth-century scholars from [[E. H. Fellowes]] onwards. In more recent times Joseph Kerman, Oliver Neighbour, Philip Brett, John Harley, Richard Turbet, Alan Brown, Kerry McCarthy, and others have made major contributions to increasing our understanding of Byrd's life and music. In 1999, [[Davitt Moroney]]'s recording of Byrd's complete keyboard music was released on [[Hyperion Records|Hyperion]] (CDA66551/7; re-issued as CDS44461/7). This recording, which won the 2000 [[Gramophone Award]] in the Early Music category and a 2000 [[Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik|Jahrespreis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik]], came with a 100-page essay by Moroney on Byrd's keyboard music. In 2010, [[The Cardinall's Musick]] under the direction of [[Andrew Carwood]] completed their recorded survey of Byrd's Latin church music. This series of thirteen recordings is the first time that all Byrd's Latin music is available on disc.

==Veneration==
Byrd is honoured together with [[John Merbecke]] and [[Thomas Tallis]] with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the US Episcopal Church]] on 21 November.

'''Erich Seligmann Fromm''' ({{IPAc-en|f|r|ɒ|m}}; {{IPA-de|fʁɔm|lang}}; March 23, 1900 – March 18, 1980) was a [[social psychologist]], [[psychoanalyst]], [[sociologist]], [[humanism|humanistic]] [[philosopher]], and [[democratic socialist]]. He was a [[German Jew]] who fled the Nazi regime and settled in the US. He was one of the Founders of The [[William Alanson White Institute]] of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology in New York City and was associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]].&lt;ref name=Funk&gt;Funk, Rainer.

Also his parents addressed his mail to 'Erich S. Fromm.'&lt;ref name=Funk /&gt;|group=n}}

==Life==
Erich Fromm was born on March 23, 1900, at [[Frankfurt am Main]], the only child of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] parents, Rosa (Krause) and Naphtali Fromm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lib.msu.edu/branches/ua/|title=MSU Libraries|website=lib.msu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his academic studies in 1918 at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] with two semesters of [[jurisprudence]].  During the summer semester of 1919, Fromm studied at the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he began studying [[sociology]] under [[Alfred Weber]] (brother of the better known sociologist [[Max Weber]]), psychiatrist-philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Heinrich Rickert]]. Fromm received his PhD in sociology from Heidelberg in 1922. During the mid-1920s, he trained to become a [[psychoanalyst]] through [[Frieda Reichmann]]'s psychoanalytic sanatorium in [[Heidelberg]]. They married in 1926, but separated shortly after and divorced in 1942. He began his own clinical practice in 1927. In 1930 he joined the Frankfurt [[Institute for Social Research]] and completed his psychoanalytical training.

After the Nazi takeover of power in Germany, Fromm moved first to [[Geneva]] and then, in 1934, to [[Columbia University]] in New York. Together with [[Karen Horney]] and [[Harry Stack Sullivan]], Fromm belongs to a [[Neo-Freudian]] school of psychoanalytical thought. Horney and Fromm each had a marked influence on the other's thought, with Horney illuminating some aspects of  psychoanalysis for Fromm and the latter elucidating sociology for Horney. Their relationship ended in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Paris, Bernard J. (1998) [http://plaza.ufl.edu/bjparis/horney/fadiman/02_pers.html Horney &amp; Humanistic Psychoanalysis – Personal History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523164003/http://plaza.ufl.edu/bjparis/horney/fadiman/02_pers.html |date=May 23, 2011 }}. International Karen Horney Society.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Columbia, Fromm helped form the New York branch of the Washington School of Psychiatry in 1943, and in 1946 co-founded the [[William Alanson White Institute]] of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and Psychology. He was on the faculty of [[Bennington College]] from 1941 to 1949, and taught courses at the [[The New School|New School for Social Research]] in New York from 1941 to 1959.

When Fromm moved to [[Mexico City]] in 1949, he became a professor at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) and established a psychoanalytic section at the medical school there. Meanwhile, he taught as a professor of psychology at [[Michigan State University]] from 1957 to 1961 and as an adjunct professor of psychology at the graduate division of Arts and Sciences at [[New York University]] after 1962. He taught at UNAM until his retirement, in 1965, and at the Mexican Society of Psychoanalysis (SMP) until 1974. In 1974 he moved from Mexico City to [[Muralto]], Switzerland, and died at his home in 1980, five days before his eightieth birthday. All the while, Fromm maintained his own clinical practice and published a series of books.

Fromm was reportedly an atheist&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;Keay Davidson: &quot;Fromm, Erich Pinchas&quot;, American National Biography Online, Feb. 2000 (accessed April 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|About the same time he stopped observing Jewish religious rituals and rejected a cause he had once embraced, Zionism. He &quot;just didn't want to participate in any division of the human race, whether religious or political,&quot; he explained decades later (Wershba, p. 12), by which time he was a confirmed atheist.&lt;ref name=Davidson /&gt;|name=|group=n}} but described his position as &quot;[[nontheistic religion|nontheistic]] [[mysticism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, E. (1966). You shall be as Gods, A Fawcett Premier Book, p. 18:&quot;Hence, I wish to make my position clear at the outset. If I could define my position approximately, I would call it that of a nontheistic mysticism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological theory==
Beginning with his first [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] work of 1941, ''[[Escape from Freedom]]'' (known in Britain as ''Fear of Freedom''), Fromm's writings were notable as much for their social and political commentary as for their philosophical and psychological underpinnings. Indeed, ''Escape from Freedom'' is viewed as one of the founding works of [[political psychology]]. His second important work, ''Man for Himself:  An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics'', first published in 1947, continued and enriched the ideas of ''Escape from Freedom''. Taken together, these books outlined Fromm's theory of human character, which was a natural outgrowth of Fromm's theory of human nature. Fromm's most popular book was ''[[The Art of Loving]]'', an international bestseller first published in 1956, which recapitulated and complemented the theoretical principles of human nature found in ''Escape from Freedom'' and ''Man for Himself''—principles which were revisited in many of Fromm's other major works.

Central to Fromm's [[world view]] was his interpretation of the [[Talmud]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. He began studying Talmud as a young man under Rabbi J. Horowitz and later under Rabbi Salman Baruch Rabinkow, a [[Chabad]] [[Hasid]]. While working towards his doctorate in sociology at the [[University of Heidelberg]],&lt;ref&gt;His 1922 thesis was under the title ''Das jüdische Gesetz. Ein Beitrag zur Soziologie des Diaspora-Judentums'' (''The Jewish Law: A Contribution to the Sociology of Jewish Diaspora'').&lt;/ref&gt; Fromm studied the [[Tanya]] by the founder of [[Chabad]], Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]]. Fromm also studied under Nehemia Nobel and Ludwig Krause while studying in Frankfurt. Fromm's grandfather and two great grandfathers on his father's side were [[rabbi]]s, and a great uncle on his mother's side was a noted Talmudic scholar.  However, Fromm turned away from orthodox Judaism in 1926, towards secular interpretations of scriptural ideals.

The cornerstone of Fromm's humanistic philosophy is his interpretation of the [[Bible|biblical]] story of [[Adam and Eve]]'s exile from the [[Garden of Eden]].  Drawing on his knowledge of the Talmud, Fromm pointed out that being able to distinguish between good and evil is generally considered to be a virtue, but that biblical scholars generally consider Adam and Eve to have ''sinned'' by disobeying God and eating from the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil|Tree of Knowledge]]. However, departing from [[Jewish orthodoxy|traditional religious orthodoxy]] on this, Fromm ''extolled'' the virtues of humans taking independent action and using reason to establish moral values rather than adhering to authoritarian moral values.

Beyond a simple condemnation of authoritarian value systems, Fromm used the story of Adam and Eve as an allegorical explanation for [[human evolution|human biological evolution]] and [[existentialism|existential]] angst, asserting that when Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge, they became aware of themselves as being separate from nature while still being part of it.  This is why they felt &quot;naked&quot; and &quot;ashamed&quot;:  they had [[evolution|evolved]] into [[human being]]s, conscious of themselves, their own mortality, and their powerlessness before the forces of nature and society, and no longer united with the universe as they were in their [[instinct]]ive, pre-human existence as animals.  According to Fromm, the awareness of a disunited human existence is a source of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[shame]], and the solution to this existential dichotomy is found in the development of one's uniquely human powers of love and reason. However, Fromm distinguished ''his'' concept of love from unreflective ''popular'' notions as well as ''Freudian paradoxical'' love (see the criticism by Marcuse [[#Criticism|below]]).

Fromm considered love an [[interpersonal]] [[creativity|creative]] capacity rather than an [[emotion]], and he distinguished this creative capacity from what he considered to be various forms of [[narcissism|narcissistic neuroses]] and [[sado-masochism|sado-masochistic]] tendencies that are commonly held out as proof of &quot;true love&quot;. Indeed, Fromm viewed the experience of &quot;falling in love&quot; as evidence of one's failure to understand the true nature of love, which he believed always had the common elements of ''care'', ''responsibility'', ''respect'', and ''knowledge''.  Drawing from his knowledge of the [[Torah]], Fromm pointed to the story of [[Jonah]], who did not wish to save the residents of [[Nineveh]] from the consequences of their sin, as demonstrative of his belief that the qualities of ''care'' and ''responsibility'' are generally absent from most [[human]] [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. Fromm also asserted that few people in modern society had ''respect'' for the autonomy of their fellow human beings, much less the objective ''knowledge'' of what other people truly wanted and needed.

Fromm believed that freedom was an aspect of human nature that we either embrace or escape. He observed that embracing our freedom of will was healthy, whereas escaping freedom through the use of escape mechanisms was the root of psychological conflicts. Fromm outlined three of the most common escape mechanisms:
*''Automaton conformity'': changing one's ideal self to conform to a perception of society's preferred type of personality, losing one's true self in the process; ''Automaton conformity'' displaces the burden of choice from self to society;
*''Authoritarianism'': giving control of oneself to another. By submitting one's freedom to someone else, this act removes the freedom of choice almost entirely.
*''Destructiveness'': any process which attempts to eliminate others or the world as a whole, all to escape freedom. Fromm said that &quot;the destruction of the world is the last, almost desperate attempt to save myself from being crushed by it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erich ''Escape from Freedom'' New York: Henry Holt and Company, LLC, 1941, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] was frequently used by Fromm as a description of a productive psychological orientation and &quot;[[state of being]]&quot;.  For example, in an addendum to his book ''The Heart of Man:  Its Genius For Good and Evil'', Fromm wrote as part of his [[Humanism|humanist]] [[credo]]:

&quot;I believe that the man choosing progress can find a new unity through the development of all his human forces, which are produced in three orientations.  These can be presented separately or together: biophilia, love for humanity and nature, and independence and freedom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erich ''On Being Human'' London: The Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd, 1997, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Erich Fromm postulated eight basic needs:

Fromm's thesis of the &quot;escape from freedom&quot; is epitomized in the following passage.  The &quot;individualized man&quot; referenced by Fromm is man bereft of the &quot;primary ties&quot; of belonging (i.e. nature, family, etc.), also expressed as &quot;freedom from&quot;:

{{quote|There is only one possible, productive solution for the relationship of individualized man with the world: his active solidarity with all men and his spontaneous activity, love and work, which unite him again with the world, not by primary ties but as a free and independent individual.... However, if the economic, social and political conditions... do not offer a basis for the realization of individuality in the sense just mentioned, while at the same time people have lost those ties which gave them security, this lag makes freedom an unbearable burden.  It then becomes identical with doubt, with a kind of life which lacks meaning and direction.  Powerful tendencies arise to escape from this kind of freedom into submission or some kind of relationship to man and the world which promises relief from uncertainty, even if it deprives the individual of his freedom.|Erich Fromm, ''Escape from Freedom'' [N.Y.: Rinehart, 1941], pp.&amp;nbsp;36–7.  The point is repeated on pp.&amp;nbsp;31, 256–7.)}}

===Five basic orientations===
{{main article|Character orientation}}
In his book ''Man for Himself'' Fromm spoke of &quot;[[Character orientation|orientation of character]]&quot;.  He differentiates his theory of character from that of Freud by focusing on two ways an individual relates to the world. Freud analyzed character in terms of libido organization, whereas Fromm says that in the process of living, we relate to the world by: 1) acquiring and assimilating things—&quot;Assimilation&quot;, and 2) reacting to people—&quot;Socialization&quot;. Fromm asserted that these two ways of relating to the world were not instinctive, but an individual's response to the peculiar circumstances of his or her life; he also believed that people are never exclusively one type of orientation. These two ways of relating to life's circumstances lead to basic character-orientations.

Fromm lists four types of nonproductive character orientation, which he called receptive, exploitative, hoarding, and marketing, and one positive character orientation, which he called productive. Receptive and exploitative orientations are basically how an individual may relate to other people and are socialization attributes of character. A hoarding orientation is an acquiring and assimilating materials/valuables character trait. The marketing orientation arises in response to the human situation in the modern era. The current needs of the market determine value. It is a relativistic ethic. In contrast, the productive orientation is an objective ethic. Despite the existential struggles of humanity, each human has the potential for love, reason and productive work in life. Fromm writes, &quot;It is the paradox of human existence that man must simultaneously seek for closeness and for independence; for oneness with others and at the same time for the preservation of his uniqueness and particularity. ...the answer to this paradox – and to the moral problems of man – is productiveness.&quot;

===Fromm's influence on other notable psychologists===
Fromm's four non-productive orientations were subject to validation through a psychometric test, ''The Person Relatedness Test'' by Elias H. Porter, PhD in collaboration with Carl Rogers, PhD at the University of Chicago's Counseling Center between 1953 and 1955.  Fromm's four non-productive orientations also served as basis for the ''LIFO'' test, first published in 1967 by Stuart Atkins, Alan Katcher, PhD, and [[Elias Porter]], PhD and the ''Strength Deployment Inventory'', first published in 1971 by Elias H. Porter, PhD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Relationship Awareness Theory Overview|url=http://www.personalstrengths.us/index.php/en/ra-theory/theory-overview|publisher=Personal Strengths Publishing|accessdate=28 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528120433/http://www.personalstrengths.us/index.php/en/ra-theory/theory-overview|archive-date=May 28, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fromm also influenced his student Sally L. Smith who went on to become the founder of the Lab School of Washington and the Baltimore Lab School.&lt;ref&gt;Liberman &amp; Kiriki,1951&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of Freud==
Fromm examined the life and work of [[Sigmund Freud]] at length. Fromm identified a discrepancy between early and later Freudian theory: namely that, prior to World War I, Freud had described human drives as a tension between desire and repression, but after the end of the war, began framing human drives as a struggle between biologically universal Life and Death ([[Sigmund Freud#Life and death drives|Eros and Thanatos]]) instincts.  Fromm charged Freud and his followers with never acknowledging the contradictions between the two theories.

Fromm also criticized Freud's dualistic thinking. According to Fromm, Freudian descriptions of human consciousness as struggles between two poles were narrow and limiting.  Fromm also condemned Freud as a [[misogynist]] unable to think outside the patriarchal milieu of early 20th century Vienna. However, in spite of these criticisms, Fromm nonetheless expressed a great respect for Freud and his accomplishments. Fromm contended that Freud was one of the &quot;architects of the modern age&quot;, alongside [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Karl Marx]], but emphasized that he considered Marx both far more historically important than Freud and a finer thinker.&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erich. ''Beyond the Chains of Illusion: My Encounter with Marx &amp; Freud''. London: Sphere Books, 1980, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political ideas and activities==
Fromm's best known work, ''Escape from Freedom'', focuses on the human urge to seek a source of authority and control upon reaching a freedom that was thought to be an individual's true desire. Fromm's critique of the modern political order and [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system led him to seek insights from [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[feudalism]]. In ''Escape from Freedom'', he found value in the lack of individual freedom, rigid structure, and obligations required on the members of medieval society:

{{quote| What characterizes medieval in contrast to modern society is its lack of individual freedom…But altogether a person was not free in the modern sense, neither was he alone and isolated.  In having a distinct, unchangeable, and unquestionable place in the social world from the moment of birth, man was rooted in a structuralized whole, and thus life had a meaning which left no place, and no need for doubt…There was comparatively little competition.  One was born into a certain economic position which guaranteed a livelihood determined by tradition, just as it carried economic obligations to those higher in the social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erich &quot;Escape from Freedom&quot; New York: Rinehart &amp; Co., 1941, p. 41 – 42&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[File:Chomsky 5 - On Fromm's alienation of man.ogg|thumb|left|[[Noam Chomsky]] discusses Erich Fromm's theory of alienation.]]
The culmination of Fromm's social and political philosophy was his book ''The Sane Society'', published in 1955, which argued in favor of a [[Humanism|humanistic]] and [[democratic socialism]]. Building primarily upon the early works of [[Karl Marx]], Fromm sought to re-emphasise the ideal of freedom, missing from most Soviet Marxism and more frequently found in the writings of [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] and liberal theoreticians. Fromm's brand of socialism rejected both [[Capitalism|Western capitalism]] and [[Soviet communism]], which he saw as dehumanizing, and which resulted in the virtually universal modern phenomenon of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]. He became one of the founders of [[Marxist humanism|socialist humanism]], promoting the early writings of Marx and his humanist messages to the US and Western European public.

In the early 1960s, Fromm published two books dealing with Marxist thought (''[[Marx's Concept of Man]]'' and ''Beyond the Chains of Illusion: My Encounter with Marx and Freud''). In 1965, working to stimulate the Western and Eastern cooperation between Marxist humanists, Fromm published a series of articles entitled ''Socialist Humanism: An International Symposium''.  In 1966, the [[American Humanist Association]] named him Humanist of the Year.

For a period, Fromm was also active in U.S. politics. He joined the [[Socialist Party of America]] in the mid-1950s, and did his best to help them provide an alternative viewpoint to [[McCarthyist]] trends in some US political thought. This alternative viewpoint was best expressed in his 1961 paper ''May Man Prevail? An Inquiry into the Facts and Fictions of Foreign Policy''. However, as a co-founder of [[Peace Action|SANE]], Fromm's strongest political activism was in the international [[peace movement]], fighting against the [[nuclear arms race]] and U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. After supporting Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s losing bid for the [[1968 Democratic National Convention|Democratic presidential nomination]], Fromm more or less retreated from the American political scene, although he did write a paper in 1974 entitled ''Remarks on the Policy of Détente'' for a hearing held by the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]]. Fromm was awarded [[Nelly Sachs Prize]] in 1979.

==Criticism==
In ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', [[Herbert Marcuse]] is critical of Fromm: In the beginning, he was a radical theorist, but later he turned to conformity. Marcuse also noted that Fromm, as well as his close colleagues Sullivan and Karen Horney, removed Freud's libido theory and other [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] concepts, which thus reduced psychoanalysis to a set of [[Ideal (ethics)|idealist]] ethics, which only embrace the [[status quo]].&lt;ref&gt;John Rickert, The Fromm-Marcuse debate revisited, 1986 in &quot;Theory and Society&quot;, vol. 15, pp. 351–400. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Dordrecht&lt;/ref&gt; Fromm's response, in both ''The Sane Society''&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, [1955] 1990 ''The Sane Society'', New York: Henry Holt&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness'',&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, [1973] 1992, ''The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness'', New York: Henry Holt.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Freud indeed deserves substantial credit for recognizing the central importance of the unconscious, but also that he tended to rectify his own concepts that depicted the self as the passive outcome of instinct and social control, with minimal volition or variability. Fromm argues that later scholars such as Marcuse accepted these concepts as dogma, whereas social psychology requires a more dynamic theoretical and empirical approach. In reference to Fromm's leftist political activism as a public intellectual, [[Noam Chomsky]] said &quot;I liked Fromm's attitudes but thought his work was pretty superficial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Barsky |first= Robert |year= 1997 |title= Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent |location= Cambridge, MA |publisher= MIT Press |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=RKUbyYPG4mcC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=Noam+Chomsky:+A+Life+of+Dissent+%22pretty+superficial%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hNuqVMyADcHuoATpkoDQDA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Noam%20Chomsky%3A%20A%20Life%20of%20Dissent%20%22pretty%20superficial%22&amp;f=false 134] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Executive Office of the President''' ('''EOP''') comprises the offices and [[list of federal agencies in the United States|agencies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-606.pdf |title=The Executive Office of the President: A Historical Overview |author=Harold C. Relyea |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |date=November 26, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2018 |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that support the work of the [[President of the United States|president]] at the [[center of government|center]] of the [[Executive branch of the United States government|executive branch]] of the [[federal government of the United States|United States federal government]]. The EOP consists of several offices and agencies, such as the [[White House Office]] (the staff working directly for and reporting to the president, including [[West Wing]] staff and the president's closest advisers), the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and the [[Office of Management and Budget]]. Some of these play a very important role in the implementation and regulation of public policy.

The EOP is also referred to as a 'permanent government', with many policy programs, and the people who implement them, continuing between presidential administrations. This is because there is a need for qualified, knowledgeable civil servants in each office or agency to inform new politicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mckeever|first=Robert J. |date=July 22, 2014|title=A Brief Introduction to US Politics |doi=10.4324/9781315837260 |isbn=9781315837260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil servants who work in the Executive Office of the President are also regarded as nonpartisan and politically neutral, so that they can give impartial advice.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

With the increase in technological and global advancement, the size of the [[White House]] staff has increased to include an array of policy experts to effectively address various fields. There are about 4,000 positions in the EOP, most of which do not require [[Advice and consent|confirmation]] from the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].

The EOP is overseen by the [[White House Chief of Staff|White House chief of staff]], since March 31, 2020, held by Chief of Staff [[Mark Meadows (North Carolina politician)|Mark Meadows]], appointed by [[Donald Trump]], the incumbent [[president of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guides.lib.uw.edu/c.php?g=341673&amp;p=2304078 |title=Library Guides: United States Federal Government Resources: The Executive Office of the President |last=Hartnett |first=Cass |website=guides.lib.uw.edu|language=en|access-date=January 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1073703744766922754|title=I am pleased to announce that Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management &amp; Budget, will be named Acting White House Chief of Staff, replacing General John Kelly, who has served our Country with distinction.

==History==
[[Image:Exec bldg.JPG|right|thumb|270px|The [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]] at night.]]
In 1939, during President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s second term in office, the foundations of the modern [[White House]] staff were created based on the recommendations of a presidentially commissioned panel of [[political science]] and [[public administration]] experts, known as the [[Brownlow Committee]], which reported that the 'president needs help'. Roosevelt lobbied Congress to approve the ''[[Reorganization Act of 1939]]''. The Act led to Reorganization Plan No. 1,&lt;ref name=&quot;Plan1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last= Roosevelt |first= Franklin D. |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15748 |title= Message to Congress on the Reorganization Act |date= April 25, 1939 |department= John T. Woolley and Gerhard Peters |work= The American Presidency Project |location= Santa Barbara |publisher= University of California |access-date=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which created the EOP,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosher&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Mosher |first= Frederick C. |title= American Public Administration: Past, Present, Future |edition= 2nd |location= Birmingham |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1975 |isbn= 0-8173-4829-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reported directly to the president. The EOP encompassed two subunits at its outset: the [[White House Office]] (WHO) and the Bureau of the Budget, the predecessor to today's [[Office of Management and Budget]], which had been created in 1921 and originally located in the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]. It absorbed most of the functions of the National Emergency Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Roosevelt |first= Franklin D. |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15760 |title= Message to Congress on Plan II to Implement the Reorganization Act |date= May 9, 1939 |department= John T. Woolley and Gerhard Peters |work= The American Presidency Project |location= Santa Barbara |publisher= University of California |quote= The plan provides for the abolition of the National Emergency Council and the transfer to the Executive Office of the President of all its functions with the exception of the film and radio activities which go to the Office of Education. |access-date=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the new staff system appeared more ambitious on paper than in practice; the increase in the size of the staff was quite modest at the start. However, it laid the groundwork for the large and organizationally complex White House staff that would emerge during the presidencies of Roosevelt's successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-606.pdf |title= The Executive Office of the President: An Historical Overview |first= Harold C. |last=Relyea |publisher= Congressional Research Service |date= March 17, 2008 |access-date=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt's efforts are also notable in contrast to those of his predecessors in office. During the 19th century, presidents had few staff resources. [[Thomas Jefferson]] had one messenger and one secretary at his disposal, both of whose salaries were paid by the president personally. It was not until 1857 that Congress appropriated money ($2,500) for the hiring of one clerk. By [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s presidency (1869–1877), the staff had grown to three. By 1900, the White House staff included one &quot;secretary to the president&quot; (then the title of the president's chief aide), two assistant secretaries, two executive clerks, a [[Stenography|stenographer]], and seven other office personnel. Under [[Warren G. Harding]], there were thirty-one staff, although most were clerical positions. During [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Herbert Hoover's presidency]], two additional secretaries to the president were added by Congress, one of whom Hoover designated as his [[White House Press Secretary|Press Secretary]]. From 1933 to 1939, as he greatly expanded the scope of the federal government's policies and powers in response to the [[Great Depression]], Roosevelt relied on his &quot;brain trust&quot; of top advisers, who were often appointed to vacant positions in agencies and departments, from which they drew their salaries since the White House lacked statutory or budgetary authority to create new staff positions.

After [[World War II]], in particular during the presidency of [[Dwight David Eisenhower]], the staff was expanded and reorganized. Eisenhower, a former U.S. Army general, had been [[Supreme Allied Commander]] during the war, and reorganized the Executive Office to suit his leadership style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Patterson |first=Bradley H. |date=1994 |title=Teams and Staff: Dwight Eisenhower's Innovations in the Structure and Operations of the Modern White House |jstor=27551241 |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=277–298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the staff is much bigger. Estimates indicate some 3,000 to 4,000 persons serve in EOP staff positions with policy-making responsibilities, with a budget of $300 to $400 million (George W. Bush's budget request for Fiscal Year 2005 was for $341 million in support of 1,850 personnel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/policy/whitehouse |title= Administration of the White House |first= John P. |last= Burke |publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia |access-date=June 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117160520/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/policy/whitehouse |archivedate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers have noted a problem of control for the president due to the increase in staff and departments, making coordination and cooperation between the various departments of the Executive Office more difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=US politics today|last=Ashbee, Edward, author.|isbn=9781526124517|oclc=1108740337|date = June 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The president had the power to reorganize the Executive Office due to the 1949 Reorganization Act which gave the president considerable discretion, until 1983 where it was renewed due to President Nixon's administration encountering 'disloyalty and obstruction'.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The Chief of Staff is the head of the Executive Office and can therefore ultimately decide what the president needs to deal with personally and what can be dealt with by other staff, in order to avoid wasting the time of the president.

Senior staff within the Executive Office of the President have the title ''Assistant to the President'', second-level staff have the title ''Deputy Assistant to the President'', and third-level staff have the title ''Special Assistant to the President''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kumar |first1=Martha Joynt |title=Assistants to the President at 18 Months: White House Turnover Among the Highest Ranking Staff and Positions |url=http://www.whitehousetransitionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Kumar_Assistants_to_the_President_Turnover_10-02-2018.pdf |website=whitehousetransitionproject.org |access-date=November 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core White House staff appointments, and most Executive Office officials generally, are not required to be [[Advice and consent|confirmed]] by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], although there are a handful of exceptions (e.g., the Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]], the Chair and members of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]], and the [[United States Trade Representative]]).

The information in the following table is current as of July 1, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Office of the President: Annual Report to Congress on White House Office Personnel|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/July-1-2019-Report-FINAL.pdf|accessdate=December 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only principal executives are listed; for subordinate officers, see individual office pages.

{{Trump Executive Office|state=collapsed}}

== Congress ==
[[United States Congress|Congress]] as well as the president has some control over the Executive Office of the President. Some of this authority stems from its appropriation powers given by the Constitution, such as the 'power of the purse', which affects the Office of Management and Budget and the funding of the rest of federal departments and agencies. Congress also has the right to investigate the operation of the Executive Office, normally holding hearings bringing forward individual personnel to testify before a congressional committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The Executive Office often helps with legislation by filling in specific points understood and written by experts, as Congressional legislation sometimes starts in broad terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Executive Role in 'Checks and Balances' System ==
The United States Constitution provides checks and balances for the U.S. government through the separation of powers between its three branches: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. 

The executive branch gives veto power to the president, allowing the president to keep the legislative branch in check. The legislative branch can overturn a president's veto with a two-thirds &quot;supermajority&quot; vote by both houses of Congress. The executive branch can also declare executive orders, effectively proclaiming how certain laws should be enforced. This can be checked by the judicial branch however who can deem these orders to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chen |first1=James |last2=Beers |first2=Brian |title=Utilizing Checks and Balances to Reduce Mistakes and Bad Behavior |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/checks-and-balances.asp |website=Investopedia |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally scholars have suggested the Executive Office has too much influence in the process of checks and balances. Scholar Matthew C. Waxman stated that the ‘executive possess significant informational and operational advantages’ and that the role that congress members face in scrutinising the executive is ‘insufficient to the task’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waxman |first1=Matthew C. |title=National Security Federalism in the Age of Terror |date=August 30, 2011 |publisher=Stanford Law Review, , Vol. 64, 2012; Columbia Public Law Research Paper |page=11–271 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1830312}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that the executive can exert influential pressure over Congress due to the massive public image the role of being the executive has on a nation. The president can portray the legislature or judiciary negatively if they don't follow the executive's agenda. President Trump, in relation to his impeachment, arguably used this implied 'executive power' by criticising the legislature. Trump suggested that the democrats within the legislature will &quot;badly fail at the voting booth&quot; suggesting that the &quot;attempted impeachment] is nothing more than an illegal, partisan coup.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirschner |first1=Glenn |title=Opinion {{!}} Trump claims that impeachment is a &quot;coup.&quot; And he's (almost) right. |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-tweets-impeachment-coup-he-s-almost-right-not-way-ncna1108346 |website=NBC News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Office of Management and Budget''' ('''OMB''') is the largest office within the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]] (EOP). OMB's most prominent function is to produce the president's budget,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mission and Structure of the Office of Management and Budget|url=http://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/omb/organization_mission/}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it also examines agency programs, policies, and procedures to see whether they comply with the president's policies and coordinates inter-agency policy initiatives.

The OMB director reports to the president, vice president and the White House chief of staff.{{cn|date=June 2020}} The current OMB Director is [[Russell Vought]]. On November 29, 2020, [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Joe Biden]] announced that he would nominate [[Neera Tanden]] as the next OMB director, subject to Senate approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Biden hires all-female senior communications team, names Neera Tanden director of OMB|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/biden-hires-all-female-senior-communications-team-names-neera-tanden-director-of-omb/ar-BB1bt6qm|access-date=2020-11-30|website=www.msn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Zhao|first1=Christina|date=2020-11-30|title=Neera Tanden's stinging criticism of Republican senators may hurt confirmation chances|url=https://www.newsweek.com/neera-tandens-stinging-criticism-republican-senators-may-hurt-confirmation-chances-1551054|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Newsweek|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
The '''Bureau of the Budget''', OMB's predecessor, was established in 1921 as a part of the Department of the Treasury by the [[Budget and Accounting Act of 1921]], which President [[Warren G. Harding]] signed into law. The Bureau of the Budget was moved to the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]] in 1939 and was run by [[Harold D. Smith]] during the government's rapid expansion of spending during [[World War II]]. James L. Sundquist, a staffer at the Bureau of the Budget, called the relationship between the president and the bureau extremely close and subsequent bureau directors politicians, not public administrators.&lt;ref&gt;Oral History Interview with James L. Sundquist, Washington, D.C., July 15, 1963, by Charles T. Morrissey, https://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/sundquis.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The bureau was reorganized into the Office of Management and Budget in 1970 during the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-84/pdf/STATUTE-84-Pg2085.pdf#page=1 |title=84 Stat. 2085 |publisher=govinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2020-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first OMB included [[Roy Ash]] (head), [[Paul O'Neill (cabinet member)|Paul O'Neill]] (assistant director), [[Fred Malek]] (deputy director), [[Frank Zarb]] (associate director) and two dozen others.

In the 1990s, OMB was reorganized to remove the distinction between management staff and budgetary staff by combining the dual roles into each given program examiner within the Resource Management Offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OMB Organization Chart |url=http://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/omb/assets/about_omb/omb_org_chart.pdf |date= |publisher=Office of Management and Budget }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
OMB prepares the president's budget proposal to Congress and supervises the administration of the executive branch agencies. It evaluates the effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and procedures, assesses competing funding demands among agencies, and sets funding priorities. OMB ensures that agency reports, rules, testimony, and proposed legislation are consistent with the president's budget and administration policies.

OMB also oversees and coordinates the administration's procurement, financial management, information, and regulatory policies. In each of these areas, OMB's role is to help improve administrative management, develop better performance measures and coordinating mechanisms, and reduce unnecessary burdens on the public.

OMB's critical missions are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/omb/organization_mission/ Organization Mission] at archive of OMB site}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Budget development and execution, a prominent government-wide process managed from the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and a device by which a president implements their policies, priorities, and actions in everything from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to [[NASA]].
#Managing other agencies' financials, paperwork, and IT.

==Structure==
===Overview===
OMB is made up mainly of career appointed staff who provide continuity across changes of party and administration in the White House. Six positions within OMB—the Director, the Deputy Director, the Deputy Director for Management, and the administrators of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]], the [[Office of Federal Procurement Policy]], and the [[Office of Federal Financial Management]]—are presidentially appointed and [[United States Senate|Senate]]-[[Advice and consent|confirmed]] positions.

OMB's largest components are the five Resource Management Offices, which are organized along functional lines mirroring the federal government, each led by an OMB associate director. Approximately half of all OMB staff are assigned to these offices, the majority of whom are designated as program examiners. Program examiners can be assigned to monitor one or more federal agencies or may be deployed by a topical area, such as monitoring issues relating to U.S. Navy warships. These staff have dual responsibility for both management and budgetary issues, as well as for giving expert advice on all aspects relating to their programs. Each year they review federal agency budget requests and help decide what resource requests will be sent to Congress as part of the president's budget. They perform in-depth program evaluations with the Program Assessment Rating Tool, review proposed regulations and agency testimony, analyze pending legislation, and oversee the aspects of the president's management agenda including agency management scorecards. They are often called upon to provide analysis information to EOP staff. They also provide important information to those assigned to the statutory offices within OMB: the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the Office of Federal Financial Management, and the [[Office of E-Government &amp; Information Technology]], which specializes in issues such as federal regulations and procurement policy and law.

Other components are OMB-wide support offices, including the Office of General Counsel, the Office of Legislative Affairs, the Budget Review Division (BRD), and the Legislative Reference Division. The BRD performs government-wide budget coordination and is largely responsible for the technical aspects relating to the release of the president's budget each February. With respect to the estimation of spending for the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]], the BRD serves a purpose parallel to that of the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (which was created in response to the OMB) for estimating Congressional spending, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] for estimating executive branch revenue, and the [[U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation|Joint Committee on Taxation]] for estimating Congressional revenue.

The Legislative Reference Division is the federal government's central clearing house for proposed legislation or testimony by federal officials. It distributes proposed legislation and testimony to all relevant federal reviewers and distills the comments into a consensus opinion of the administration about the proposal. It is also responsible for writing an Enrolled Bill Memorandum to the president once a bill is presented by both chambers of Congress for the president's signature. The Enrolled Bill Memorandum details the bill's particulars, opinions on the bill from relevant federal departments, and an overall opinion about whether it should be signed into law or [[Veto#United States|vetoed]]. It also issues Statements of Administration Policy that let Congress know the White House's official position on proposed legislation.

=== Role in the executive budget process ===
In practice, the president has assigned the OMB certain responsibilities when it comes to the budget and hiring authorities who play key roles in developing it. OMB coordinates the development of the president’s budget proposal by issuing circulars, memoranda, and guidance documents to the heads of executive agencies. The OMB works very closely with executive agencies in making sure the budget process and proposal is smooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Office of Management and Budget and the presidency, 1921-1979|last=1951-|first=Berman, Larry|isbn=9781400867288|location=Princeton, New Jersey|oclc=905862779|date = 2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the budget within the executive branch has many steps and takes nearly a year to complete. The first step is the OMB informing the president of the country's economic situation. The next step is known as the Spring Guidance: the OMB gives executive agencies instructions on policy guidance to use when coming up with their budget requests along with due dates for them to submit their requests. The OMB then works with the agencies to discuss issues in the upcoming budget. In July, the OMB issues circular A-11 to all agencies, which outlines instructions for submitting the budget proposals, which the agencies submit by September. The [[fiscal year]] begins October 1 and OMB staff meet with senior agency representatives to find out whether their proposals are in line with the president’s priorities and policies and identify constraints within the budget proposal until late November. The OMB director then meets with the president and EOP advisors to discuss the agencies' budget proposals and recommends a federal budget proposal, and the agencies are notified of the decisions about their requests. They can appeal to OMB and the president in December if they are dissatisfied with the decisions. After working together to resolve issues, agencies and OMB prepare a budget justification document to present to relevant congressional committees, especially the Appropriations Committee. Finally, by the first Monday in February, the president must review and submit the final budget to Congress to approve.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Policymaking|last=Shambaugwh IV, Weinstein Jr.|first=George E., Paul J|publisher=CQ Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0321081032|location=Thousand Oaks, California|pages=109–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OMB is also responsible for the preparation of [[Statements of Administrative Policy]] (SAPs) with the president. These statements allow the OMB to communicate the president's and agencies' policies to the government as a whole and set forth policymakers' agendas.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; During the review of the federal budget, interest groups can lobby for policy change and affect the budget for the new year.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haeder|first=Simon F.|last2=Yackee|first2=Susan Webb|date=August 2015|title=Influence and the Administrative Process: Lobbying the U.S. President's Office of Management and Budget|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=109|issue=3|pages=507–522|doi=10.1017/S0003055415000246|issn=0003-0554}}&lt;/ref&gt; OMB plays a key role in policy conflicts by making sure legislation and agencies' actions are consistent with the executive branch's. OMB has a powerful and influential role in the government, basically making sure its day-to-day operations run. Without a budget, federal employees could not be paid, federal buildings could not open and federal programs would come to a halt in a [[Government shutdowns in the United States|government shutdown.]] Shutdowns can occur when Congress refuses to accept a budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The marathon is run over a largely flat course around the [[River Thames]], and spans {{convert|42.195|km|mi|3}}. &lt;!-- Official distance in IAAF rulebook is metric, therefore stated here first.

The course begins at three separate points: the 'red start' in southern [[Greenwich Park]] on Charlton Way, the 'green start' in St John's Park, and the 'blue start' on Shooter's Hill Road.&lt;ref name=&quot;Route&quot; /&gt; From these points around [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] at {{convert|35|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, south of the River Thames, the route heads east through [[Charlton, London|Charlton]]. The three courses converge after {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=in}} in [[Woolwich]], close to the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Route&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Interactive Marathon Map |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/athletics/8011891.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=13 May 2009  | date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Map&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first1=Peter |last1=Storey |first2=Tola |last2=Onanuga |first3=Sam |last3=Murphy |first4=John |last4=Ashdown |title=London Marathon 2009: Mile-by-mile route map |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/interactive/2009/apr/22/london-marathon-route-map |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 April 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the runners reach the {{convert|10|km|mi|adj=mid|mark|abbr=in}}, they pass by the [[Old Royal Naval College]] and head towards ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' [[drydock]]ed in [[Greenwich]]. Heading next into [[Deptford]] and [[Surrey Quays]]/[[Rotherhithe]] in the [[London Docklands|Docklands]], and out towards [[Bermondsey]], competitors race along [[Jamaica Road]] before reaching the half-way point as they cross [[Tower Bridge]]. Running east again along [[The Highway]] through [[Wapping]], competitors head up towards [[Limehouse]] and into [[Mudchute]] in the [[Isle of Dogs]] via Westferry Road, before heading into [[Canary Wharf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Route&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Map&quot; /&gt;

As the route leads away from Canary Wharf into [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], competitors run west down Poplar High Street back towards Limehouse and on through [[Commercial Road]]. They then move back onto The Highway, onto Lower and Upper Thames Streets. Heading into the final leg of the race, competitors pass The Tower of London on Tower Hill.  In the penultimate mile along [[Thames Embankment|The Embankment]], the [[London Eye]] comes into view, before the athletes turn right into [[Birdcage Walk]] to complete the final {{convert|352|m|yd|abbr=in}}, catching the sights of [[Big Ben]] and [[Buckingham Palace]], and finishing in [[The Mall, London|The Mall]] alongside [[St. James's Palace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Route&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Map&quot; /&gt; This final section of the route formed part of the [[2012 Olympic Marathon Course]].

Since the first marathon, the course has undergone very few route changes. In the first race, the course took a diversion around Southwark Park before re-joining Jamaica Road on the way to Tower Bridge and was routed through St Katherine Docks past the Tower Hotel, en route to the Tower of London and the cobblestoned stretch of road that in later years was carpeted, to help runners prevent injury on the uneven surface.  In 1982, the finishing post was moved from [[Constitution Hill, London|Constitution Hill]] to [[Westminster Bridge]] due to construction works. It remained there for twelve years before moving to its present location at The Mall. In 2005, the route around the [[Isle of Dogs]] between {{convert|22|and|34|km|mi}} was switched from a clockwise to an anti-clockwise direction, and at {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=in}} the route was diverted to avoid St Katherine Docks and the [[cobblestone]]d area near the [[Tower of London]]. In 2008, a suspected gas leak at a pub in Wapping diverted the course, but in 2009 the race followed the same path as in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian history&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first1=Abigail |last1=Gliddon |first2=Tola |last2=Onanuga |title=London Marathon: A brief history |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/24/london-marathon-brief-history |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Virgin history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the London Marathon – Course History |url=http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/marathon-centre/history-london-marathon/course-history/ |publisher=London Marathon |accessdate=13 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513081114/http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/marathon-centre/history-london-marathon/course-history/ |archive-date=13 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012 mile 21 has become a significant cheer zone with [[Run Dem Crew]] transforming the stretch of Commercial Road outside the former Limehouse town hall into a street party with music and confetti cannons. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/in-pictures-run-dem-crews-mile-21-cheer-zone-at-the-london-marathon-042216&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]], the 2020 London Marathon was run on a non-traditional course, consisting of 19.6 laps of length {{convert|2.15|km|mi}} around [[St James's Park]], taking in [[The Mall, London|The Mall]], [[Horse Guards Parade]], [[Birdcage Walk]] and [[Buckingham Palace]]. The final circuit was {{convert|1,345|m|mi|2}} along the Mall, following the finish line of the traditional London Marathon course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| url= https://www.athleticsweekly.com/event-news/first-look-2020-london-marathon-course-1039931979/| title= First look at the 2020 London Marathon course| magazine=[[Athletics Weekly]]| date=3 September 2020| accessdate=11 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur runners==
[[File:2013 London Marathon at Victoria Embankment (1).JPG|thumb|Amateur runners in the race running along [[Victoria Embankment]]]]
The race attracts amateur runners who make up the bulk of the thirty thousand or more participants; commonly running in fancy dress for charity causes. In 2002, [[Lloyd Scott]] completed the marathon wearing a [[deep sea diving]] suit that weighed a total of {{convert|110|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, with each shoe weighing {{convert|24|lb|kg|abbr=on}}; he also set a record for the slowest London Marathon time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1935471.stm |title=BBC News &amp;#124; UK &amp;#124; Marathon man erodes lead boots  |work=[[BBC News]] |date=17 April 2002 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=London |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 2003, former boxer [[Michael Watson]], who had been told he would never be able to walk again after a fight with [[Chris Eubank]], made headlines by finishing the marathon in six days. In 2006, Sir [[Steve Redgrave]] (winner of five consecutive Olympic gold medals) set a new [[Guinness World Record]] for money raised through a marathon by collecting £1.8&amp;nbsp;million in sponsorship. This broke the record set the previous year by the founder of the [[Oasis Trust]], [[Steve Chalke]], who had collected over £1.25&amp;nbsp;million. In 2011, Chalke raised a new record £2.32&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oasisuk.org |title=Oasis Trust |publisher=Oasisuk.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The £500 that Claire Squires collected before the race increased to over £1 million after she died having collapsed during the 2012 race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hill |first1=Amelia |title=Claire Squires: amphetamine stimulant 'had role' in runner's fatal heart attack |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/30/claire-squires-runner-dmaa-fatal |accessdate=8 September 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of runners, known as the &quot;[[London Marathon Ever Presents|Ever Presents]]&quot;, have completed each of the London Marathons since 1981. When the list was first established in 1995, there were 42. After [[2019 London Marathon|2019]], their number has shrunk to 10. At the running of the 2019 event, the oldest runner was 85-year old Kenneth Jones, whilst the youngest runner was 60-year-old Chris Finill. They are all male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Peel |url=http://www.everpresent.org.uk/ |title=Ever Present Home Page |publisher=Everpresent.org.uk |date= |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ecumenical councils of the Catholic Church}}

The '''Second Council of Constantinople''' is the fifth of the [[first seven ecumenical councils]] recognized by both the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Catholic Church]]. It is also recognized by the [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholics]] and others. [[Protestantism|Protestant]] opinions and recognition of it are varied. Some Protestants, such as [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], recognize the first four councils,&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'' Lutheran–Orthodox Joint Commission, Seventh Meeting, The Ecumenical Councils, Common Statement, 1993, ''available at'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20140106233748/http://www.helsinki.fi/~risaarin/lutortjointtext.html#unde Lutheran–Orthodox Joint Commission] (B. I. 5a. &quot;We agree on the doctrine of God, the Holy Trinity, as formulated by the Ecumenical Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople and on the doctrine of the person of Christ as formulated by the first four Ecumenical Councils.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas most [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] accept all seven. Constantinople II was convoked by the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] under the presidency of [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Eutychius of Constantinople]]. It was held from 5 May to 2 June 553. Participants were overwhelmingly [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern bishops]]—only sixteen [[Western Christianity|Western bishops]] were present, including nine from [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]] and seven from Africa, but none from Italy—out of the 152 total.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xii.ii.html |title=NPNF2–14.

* (3 names, 3 bishops and 145 other, plus 1 pope, total 152)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

The main work of the council was to confirm the condemnation issued by edict in 551 by the [[Byzantine Empire|Emperor]] [[Justinian]] against the [[Three Chapters Controversy|Three Chapters]]. These were the Christological writings and ultimately the person of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] (died 428), certain writings against [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s Twelve Anathemas accepted at the [[Council of Ephesus]], written by [[Theodoret of Cyrrhus]] (died {{circa|466}}), and a letter written against Cyrillianism and the Ephesian Council by [[Ibas of Edessa]] (died 457).&lt;ref name=Davis242/&gt;

The purpose of the condemnation was to make plain that the Great Church, which followed a [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] creed, was firmly opposed to [[Nestorianism]] as supported by the [[School of Antioch|Antiochene school]] which had either assisted [[Nestorius]], the eponymous [[heresiarch]], or had inspired the teaching for which he was anathematized and exiled. The council also condemned the teaching that [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] could not be rightly called the [[Mother of God]] (Gk. ''[[Theotokos]]'') but only the mother of the man (Gk. ''anthropotokos'') or the mother of Christ (Gk. ''Christotokos'').&lt;ref name=Davis242/&gt;

Justinian hoped that this would contribute to a reunion between the Chalcedonians and [[monophysitism|monophysites]] in the eastern provinces of the Empire. Various attempts at reconciliation between these parties within the Byzantine Empire were made by many emperors over the four centuries following the Council of Ephesus, none of them successful. Some attempts at reconciliation, such as this one, the condemnation of the Three Chapters and the unprecedented posthumous [[anathema]]tization of Theodore—who had once been widely esteemed as a pillar of orthodoxy—causing further [[schism]]s and [[heresy|heresies]] to arise in the process, such as the aforementioned [[schism of the Three Chapters]] and the emergent semi-monophysite compromises of [[monoenergism]] and [[monotheletism]]. These propositions assert, respectively, that Christ possessed no human energy but only a divine function or principle of operation (purposefully formulated in an equivocal and vague manner, and promulgated between 610 and 622 by the [[Emperor Heraclius]] under the advice of Patriarch [[Sergius I of Constantinople]]) and that Christ possessed no human will but only a divine will, &quot;will&quot; being understood to mean the desires and appetites in accord with the nature (promulgated in 638 by the same and opposed most notably by [[Maximus the Confessor]]).&lt;ref name=Davis242/&gt;

{{details|Three-Chapter Controversy}}

The Council was presided over by [[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople|Eutychius]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], assisted by the other three eastern patriarchs or their representatives.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=241–243}} Pope Vigilius was also invited; but even though he was at this period resident in Constantinople (to avoid the perils of life in Italy, convulsed by the war against the Ostrogoths), he declined to attend, and even issued a document forbidding the council from preceding without him (his 'First Constitutum'). For more details see [[Pope Vigilius]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The council, however, proceeded without the pope to condemn the Three Chapters. And during the seventh session of the council, the bishops had Vigilius stricken from the [[diptych]]s for his refusal to appear at the council and approve its proceedings, effectively excommunicating him personally but not the rest of the Western Church. Vigilius was then imprisoned in Constantinople by the emperor and his advisors were exiled. After six months, in December 553, he agreed, however, to condemn the Three Chapters, claiming that his hesitation was due to being misled by his advisors.&lt;ref name=Davis242&gt;{{Citation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMhzlnY0P0QC&amp;q=Vigilius+Judicatum+diptychs&amp;pg=PA242 |chapter=Chapter 6 Council of Constantinople II, 553 |title=The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325–787): Their History and Theology |author=Leo Donald Davis |author-link=Leo Donald Davis |publisher=The Liturgical Press |location=Collegeville, Minnesota |year=1983 |isbn=978-0814656167 |pages=242–248 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His approval of the council was expressed in two documents, (a letter to Eutychius of Constantinople on 8 December 553, and a second &quot;Constitutum&quot; of 23 February 554, probably addressed to the Western episcopate), condemning the Three Chapters,&lt;ref&gt;[[Giovanni Domenico Mansi|Mansi]], ''Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio'', vol. IX, p. 414–420, 457–488; cf. Hefele, ''Conciliengeschichte'', vol. II, pp. 905–911.&lt;/ref&gt; on his own authority and without mention of the council.&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;{{Catholic|inline=1 |wstitle=Councils_of_Constantinople |author=Thomas J. Shahan |authorlink=Thomas Joseph Shahan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Italy the ecclesiastical provinces of [[Milan]] and [[Aquileia]] [[Schism of the Three Chapters|broke communion with Rome]]. Milan accepted the condemnation only toward the end of the sixth century, whereas Aquileia did not do so until about 700.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hefele, ''Conciliengeschichte'', vol. II, pp. 911–927. (For an equitable appreciation of the conduct of Vigilius see, besides the article [[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Pope Vigilius|VIGILIUS]], the judgment of Bois, in Diet. de theol. cath., II, 1238–39.)&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the Western Church accepted the decrees of the council, though without great enthusiasm. Though ranked as one of the ecumenical councils, it never attained in the West the status of either Nicaea or Chalcedon.

In Visigothic Spain ([[Reccared]] having converted a short time prior) the churches never accepted the council;&lt;ref&gt;Herrin (1989) pp. 240–241&lt;/ref&gt; when news of the later [[Third Council of Constantinople]] was communicated to them by Rome it was received as the ''fifth'' ecumenical council,&lt;ref&gt;Herrin (1989) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; not the sixth. [[Isidore of Seville]], in his ''Chronicle'' and ''De Viris Illustribus'', judged Justinian a tyrant and persecutor of the orthodox&lt;ref&gt;Herrin (1989) p. 241 and the references therein&lt;/ref&gt; and an admirer of heresy,&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]], ''Chronica Maiora'', no. 397a&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting him with [[Facundus of Hermiane]] and [[Victor of Tunnuna]], who was considered a martyr.&lt;ref&gt;Herrin (1989) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the conflict between the council and the pope, and the inability to reconcile Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians, the council still made a significant theological contribution. The canons condemning the Three Chapters were preceded by ten dogmatic canons which defined Chalcedonian Christology with a new precision, bringing out that {{citation needed span|God the Word is the one subject of all the operations of Christ, divine and human|date=May 2017}}. The 'two natures' defined at Chalcedon were now clearly interpreted as two sets of attributes possessed by a single person, Christ God, the Second Person of the Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;Price (2009) vol. I, p. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt; Later Byzantine Christology, as found in Maximus the Confessor and John of Damascus, was built upon this basis. It might have proved sufficient, moreover, to bring about the reunion of Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians, had it not been for the severance of connections between the two groups that resulted from the [[Muslim conquests]] of the next century.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Acts==

The original Greek acts of the council are lost,&lt;ref name=excursus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xii.iii.html |title=NPNF2–14.

Tomus IV, volumen I |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |location=Berlin }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of which there is now an English translation and commentary,&lt;ref&gt;Price (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; it was alleged (probably falsely) that the original Acts of the Fifth Council had been tampered with&lt;ref&gt;Hefele, ''Conciliengeschichte'', vol. II, pp. 855–858&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of Monothelitism.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt; It used to be argued that the extant acts are incomplete, since they make no mention of the debate over Origenism. However, the solution generally accepted today is that the bishops signed the canons condemning Origenism before the council formally opened.&lt;ref&gt;Price (2009) vol. 2, pp. 270-86.&lt;/ref&gt; This condemnation was confirmed by Pope Vigilius and the subsequent ecumenical council (third Council of Constantinople) gave its &quot;assent&quot; in its Definition of Faith to the five previous synods, including &quot;... the last, that is the Fifth holy Synod assembled in this place, against Theodore of Mopsuestia, Origen, Didymus, and Evagrius ...&quot;;&lt;ref name=DoF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xiii.x.html |title=NPNF2–14.

An '''aerobot''' is an aerial [[robot]], usually used in the context of an [[Robotic spacecraft|unmanned space probe]] or [[unmanned aerial vehicle]].

While work has been done since the 1960s on robot &quot;[[rover (space exploration)|rover]]s&quot; to explore the [[Moon]] and other worlds in the [[Solar system]], such machines have limitations. They tend to be expensive and have limited range, and due to the communications time lags over interplanetary distances, they have to be smart enough to navigate without disabling themselves.

For planets with atmospheres of any substance, however, there is an alternative: an autonomous flying robot, or &quot;aerobot&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes D.P., Summers, P., Shaw, A., &quot;An investigation into aerobot technologies for planetary exploration,&quot; in ''Proc. 6th ESA Workshop on Advanced Space Technologies for Robotics and Automation'', ASTRA 2000.

[http://users.aber.ac.uk/dpb/astra_00.pdf PDF version] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515134442/http://users.aber.ac.uk/dpb/astra_00.pdf |date=May 15, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;colozza&quot;&gt;Anthony Colozza, Geoffrey Landis, and Valerie Lyons, ''Overview of Innovative Aircraft Power and Propulsion Systems and Their Applications for Planetary Exploration,'' NASA TM-2003-212459 (July 2003) [http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/citations/all/tm-2003-212459.html link to NASA TM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512153750/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/citations/all/tm-2003-212459.html |date=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most aerobot concepts are based on [[aerostat]]s, primarily [[balloon]]s, but occasionally [[airships]]. Flying above obstructions in the winds, a balloon could explore large regions of a planet in detail for relatively low cost.  Airplanes for planetary exploration have also been proposed.

==Basics of balloons==
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}
While the notion of sending a balloon to another planet sounds strange at first, balloons have a number of advantages for planetary exploration. They can be made light in weight and are potentially relatively inexpensive. They can cover a great deal of ground, and their view from a height gives them the ability to examine wide swathes of terrain with far more detail than would be available from an orbiting [[satellite]]. For exploratory missions, their relative lack of directional control is not a major obstacle as there is generally no need to direct them to a specific location.

Balloon designs for possible planetary missions have involved a few unusual concepts. One is the solar, or [[infrared]] (IR) [[Montgolfiere]]. This is a [[hot-air balloon]] where the envelope is made from a material that traps heat from sunlight, or from heat radiated from a planetary surface. Black is the best color for absorbing heat, but other factors are involved and the material may not necessarily be black.

Solar Montgolfieres have several advantages for planetary exploration, as they can be easier to deploy than a light gas balloon, do not necessarily require a tank of light gas for inflation, and are relatively forgiving of small leaks. They do have the disadvantage that they are only aloft during daylight hours.

The other is a &quot;reversible fluid&quot; balloon. This type of balloon consists of an envelope connected to a reservoir, with the reservoir containing a fluid that is easily [[vapor]]ized. The balloon can be made to rise by vaporizing the fluid into gas, and can be made to sink by condensing the gas back into fluid. There are a number of different ways of implementing this scheme, but the physical principle is the same in all cases.

A balloon designed for planetary exploration will carry a small [[Airship|gondola]] containing an instrument payload. The gondola will also carry power, control, and communications subsystems. Due to weight and power supply constraints, the communications subsystem will generally be small and low power, and interplanetary communications will be performed through an orbiting planetary probe acting as a relay.

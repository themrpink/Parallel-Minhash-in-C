'''Lucius Cornelius Cinna''' (died 84&amp;nbsp;BC) was a four-time [[Roman consul|consul]] of the [[Roman Republic]], serving four consecutive terms from 87 to 84&amp;nbsp;BC, and a member of the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[Cinna]] family of the [[Cornelia gens]].

Cinna's influence in Rome exacerbated the tensions which existed between [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. After the death of Marius, he became the leading power in Rome until his own death. His main impact upon Roman politics was his ability to veil his tyranny and make it appear that he was working under a constitutional government. His policies also impinged on [[Julius Caesar]], who married his daughter.

==Rise to power==
Little is known about Cinna before his bid for the consulship of 87&amp;nbsp;BC. He had praetorian rank in the [[Social War (91–88 BC)]], and had most likely also been [[praetor]] previous to this time. Cinna was elected as [[Roman consul]] in 87&amp;nbsp;BC, but historians disagree about who supported his election and what his original political goals and causes were. All seem to agree on a basic chain of events, however: Cinna was elected at a time when [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] (the current consul) was very unpopular with the lower classes and the [[socii|Latin allies]], because he had sided with the [[Roman Senate]], blocking the advancement of their rights as citizens. The people had intentionally elected candidates (probably for [[tribune]]) who were not supported by Sulla.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bennett, Cinna and His Times: A Critical and Interpretive Study of Roman History During the Period 87–84&amp;nbsp;BC (Menasha, WI: The Collegiate Press, 1923), 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Sulla had slightly more control over the election for consul, or at least, had enough power to be certain no one who supported his rival, Marius, could be elected.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Seager, “Sulla,” in The Last Age of the Roman Empire. The Cambridge Ancient History. Vol IX. Great Britain: Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulla seems to have supported Cinna as a compromise candidate, but clearly did not trust him, as seen from an anecdote from [[Plutarch]]. Immediately after Cinna's election, Sulla made Cinna swear loyalty to him by taking a stone up to the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]] and casting it down, &quot;praying that, if he failed to preserve his goodwill for Sulla, he might be thrown out of Rome as the stone was thrown out of his hand&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, “Sulla,” in The Fall of the Roman Republic, trans. Rex Warner (London: Penguin Books, 2005), Section 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Somehow then, Cinna had enough support to be elected. Various theories on who supported him and why are postulated based on what he did while in office, but all agree that Sulla was correct in his distrust. [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)|Gnaeus Octavius]] was elected as Cinna's colleague under relatively similar circumstances, though Octavius probably had more support from Sulla.&lt;ref&gt;C. Meinhard Bulst, “‘Cinnanum Tempus’: A Reassessment of the ‘Dominatio Cinnae’, “Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte 13, no. 3 (1964): 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First consulship and exile==

One of Cinna's first decisions as consul was not to let his oath to Sulla influence his decisions as consul. Cinna argued that the oath should not prevent him from helping the people of Rome. Soon after this, Cinna sought to remove Sulla from the city. He brought some sort of charge against Sulla soon after coming to power. Sulla, rather than facing the charge, escaped with his army and led them to fight the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] in [[Boeotia]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, “Gaius Marius,” in The Fall of the Roman Republic, trans. Rex Warner (London: Penguin Books, 2005), Section 41.&lt;/ref&gt; This left only Octavius and the Senate to defend the causes of Sulla in Rome. Cinna eventually supported many causes, which leads to some debate concerning his original goals and to accusations that he chose his issues based on bribes.

Two causes predominated, that of the exiles and that of the Italians. [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] and his supporters, as well as many prominent supporters of [[Publius Sulpicius Rufus]], had been exiled from Rome under Sulla's rule, but were still very popular amongst the people. It is clear that there were later connections between Cinna and this group (see &quot;Preparations while in exile&quot;), but it is not clear at what point he took up this cause.&lt;ref&gt;Bulst, Cinnanum Tempus, 308–310.&lt;/ref&gt; The other cause, to which Cinna can be more clearly connected, is that of the “[[novus civis]]” or “new citizen”. These were members of Italian tribes who had been promised [[citizenship]] as a condition of peace in the Social War. Technically they had been given citizenship with its associated protections, but in such a way that their ability to influence Roman policy was negated by their placement in tribes whose place in voting was seldom called upon. Cinna, even before his election, seems to have favored this cause. Certainly after his election, he worked to increase their rights, fighting against Octavius, who tried to maintain the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lovano, The Age of Cinna: Crucible of Late Republican Rome. (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 2002), 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; This feud ended in one of the largest street fights ever to occur in Rome,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lucius Cornelius Cinna: War against the State to Save the State  @  Project Mosaic: Witness|url = http://social.rollins.edu/wpsites/mosaic-witness/2013/10/20/lucius-cornelius-cinna-war-against-the-state-to-save-the-state/|website = social.rollins.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-06|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208055820/http://social.rollins.edu/wpsites/mosaic-witness/2013/10/20/lucius-cornelius-cinna-war-against-the-state-to-save-the-state/|archive-date = 2015-12-08|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the supporters of Octavius and the supporters of Cinna.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, “The Civil Wars, Book I” in Appian’s Roman History, trans. Horace White (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1964).CI,64&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Appian]] states that Cinna had no support from the “old citizens” in anything, including the street fight, this is highly unlikely, as none of his laws would have been a threat without at least some support from this quarter. Why the “old citizens” supported him, and how many of them supported him, is entirely unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Bulst, Cinnanum Tempus, 310–311&lt;/ref&gt; Octavius used the street fight, one of the largest to ever take place in the Forum, to justify exiling Cinna immediately, deposing him of his office and citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;Appian “The Civil Wars”, CI, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; an accusation that seems to have stuck with many historians, who accused Cinna of acting as a dictator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Gaius Marius, Section 41&quot;&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Marius, Section 41&lt;/ref&gt; The deposition of Cinna was unconstitutional, and illegal,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; and the only instance of its kind in the history of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Cinna and His Times, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations while in exile==
Cinna was joined by [[Quintus Sertorius]], a hero of the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]], and together they began to raise an army from the Italian countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p.26; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; Sertorius had a splendid military record and was popular with the soldiers and Cinna's connections with the Italian groups seem to have been quite strong, as they quickly joined his forces (although accusations of bribery abound among the ancient historians&lt;ref&gt;Lovano, The Age of Cinna, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;). At this point, the connections between Marius and Cinna become quite clear.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Cinna and His Times, 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Because they shared the support of the Italians, Cinna was willing to join forces with Marius. Together they planned to retake the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Gaius Marius, Section 41&quot;/&gt; Cinna's and Marius’s army moved through the countryside, cutting off supply routes and cities used for food storage from the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Marius'', 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invasion and slaughter of Rome==
The first major battle of the conflict occurred at the [[Janiculum]], where Octavius’ forces prevailed, but with heavy losses, including the general [[Pompeius Strabo]]. This demoralized Octavius’ army, but did not hinder the siege of Cinna and Marius, further weakening Rome. Eventually, after various skirmishes around the outskirts of Rome, negotiators secured Cinna’s assurance that he would not “willingly cause anyone’s death on reentering Rome”.&lt;ref&gt;Lovano, The Age of Cinna, 44&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in late 87&amp;nbsp;BC, Cinna was reinstated as consul and the armies reentered the city. As Cinna and his bodyguard entered, however, Marius refused to enter Rome until his exile was officially repealed. The Senate quickly began to vote to approve this, but before it finished, Marius had given up all pretense and entered the city with his bodyguard, the Bardyiae. This unit consisted of Marius’ slaves who killed at Marius’ orders. Marius, according to the ancient historians, filled the city with blood, slaughtering anyone who remotely supported Sulla, had a lot of property, or was a personal enemy of Marius.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Marius, Section 42-44&lt;/ref&gt; These claims are most likely exaggerated, as they do not appear in Sulla’s memoirs, a source that would seem biased against Marius.&lt;ref&gt;Lovano, The Age of Cinna, 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; These seem to appear later, but all agree that Cinna distanced himself from the indiscriminate slaughter, ordering only the deaths of Octavius and others who were direct political threats.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Civil Wars, Book I, CI, 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, “Cinna had had enough of murder”, and he and [[Quintus Sertorius]], a general who supported Marius and later governed Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Lovano, The Age of Cinna, 26&lt;/ref&gt; had their troops ambush the sleeping Bardyiae, ending their reign of terror.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Marius, Section 44&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this, in 86&amp;nbsp;BC, Marius and Cinna were reelected for consulship. Seventeen days after attaining his much sought seventh consulship, Marius died.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Civil Wars,Book I,139 (CI,75 and translator’s notes)&lt;/ref&gt; This began the era many historians have termed the “Dominatio Cinnae” (Domination of Cinna).

==Dominatio Cinnae==
What occurred during this period is not as well documented as other parts of Cinna’s life. After the death of Marius, [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus (consul 86 BC)|Lucius Valerius Flaccus]] succeeded him. Flaccus’ major contribution was the submission of a bill attempting to solve a financial crisis. The [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] had caused a financial depression, resulting in exorbitant interest on loans and collapsing financial confidence in Rome after the start of the [[First Mithridatic War|Mithridatic War]]. Counterfeiting became rampant, forcing Cinna and the government to develop testing stations to discover the false coins and replace them with good ones.&lt;ref&gt;Bennet, Cinna and His Times, 40–42&lt;/ref&gt;

In 85&amp;nbsp;BC, Cinna attempted to revive [[Publius Sulpicius Rufus|Sulpicius']] bill to solidify the citizenship of the [[socii|Italian groups]], but it was not in practice quickly as the census the next year lists 463,000&lt;ref&gt;Seager, Sulla, 181&lt;/ref&gt; citizens. This is not a large enough increase from 115/114 BC, where the total was 394,336, to have included the Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Bennet, Cinna and His Times, 44&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Cinna’s attention while ruling Rome was focused on dealing with Sulla. Flaccus soon took over the war against Mithridates, which Sulla interpreted as a threat; Sulla then moved to intercept Flaccus.

Flaccus was disliked by his soldiers and many deserted to Sulla. That any remained was due to the legate [[Gaius Flavius Fimbria|Fimbria]], who used his popularity and influence with the troops to convince them to stay. This did not benefit Flaccus for long though, as Fimbria later had the army rebel against Flaccus and continue against Mithridates under his own leadership. Fimbria tried to offer peace with Sulla, but Sulla and Mithridates were already in negotiations which were favorable to both parties, therefore negating any necessity for Fimbria’s offer to Mithridates. After confirming peace with Mithridates, Sulla went to negotiate with Fimbria, at which point Fimbria’s army deserted to Sulla and Fimbria committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Bennet, Cinna and His Times, 46–57&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing his war, Sulla prepared his return to Italy. He sent out letters to the Italians in order to soothe the fear that he would take away their citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Seager, Sulla, 182&lt;/ref&gt; Sulla also sent a letter to the Senate regaling them of his victories over Mithridates and assuring them that he had received those exiled by Cinna and that he would provide swift retribution to those who were guilty of causing himself and the Senate to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;Bennet, Cinna and His Times, 59&lt;/ref&gt; Cinna and his colleague, Carbo, prepared for war. They postponed the elections of that year, declaring themselves re-elected so that they would not have to return to Rome early to participate in an election. It is unlikely that this was contested because Cinna and his allies had enough power that no one dared to run in opposition to them.&lt;ref&gt;Bennet, Cinna and His Times, 60&lt;/ref&gt; While complying with the constitution, this allowed Cinna to act as monarch while still appearing to follow the will of the population. As Cinna and Carbo doubled their efforts for war with the looming threat of Sulla, Cinna was unaware that it would not be battle, but his preparations for war, which would cost him his life.&lt;ref&gt;Seager, Sulla, 184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Cinna was murdered in a mutiny of his own soldiers in 84 BC. He had been working to transport his troops across the Adriatic in order to meet Sulla on foreign soil. The troops were not eager for the upcoming fight, which promised no loot. Their dissatisfaction increased when they heard that the second convoy of troops, still in transit, had been shipwrecked in a storm. The survivors had returned to their homes. Cinna ordered an assembly in order to frighten the troops into obedience. One of his lictors struck a soldier who had been standing in the way as Cinna entered the gathering, and when the soldier hit back, Cinna ordered his arrest. This caused another soldier to throw a stone at Cinna, which struck him. The spirit of the mob then took hold as more missiles were thrown and the nearest soldiers stabbed Cinna to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennet, Cinna and His Times, 61&quot;&gt;Bennet, Cinna and His Times, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch tells a slightly different story, stating that [[Pompey the Great|Pompey]] visited Cinna’s camp and escaped, after having been accused of some wrongdoing. The soldiers assumed that Cinna had helped Pompey escape and killed Cinna for this breach of their trust.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennet, Cinna and His Times, 61&quot;/&gt; In both accounts, Cinna was murdered not due to his politics, but as more of a brief flare-up of the mob spirit within his troops. Christoph Bulst argues that Cinna was killed in “an absolutely un-political mutiny,” pointing out that there is no mention of specific opposition to Cinna, and that he did not even feel the need to travel with a bodyguard.&lt;ref&gt;Bulst, Cinnanum Tempus, 310&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
[[File:Cornelia Cinnae.jpg|left|thumb|Cinna's daughter Cornelia, who married Julius Caesar.]]
[[File:Julia caesaris.jpg|right|thumb|Cornelia and Caesar's daughter Julia]]

Cinna was married to Annia. They had two daughters and a son. The elder daughter, Cornelia Major, married [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (died 81 BC)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]], one of Cinna’s supporters. The younger daughter, [[Cornelia (wife of Caesar)|Cornelia Minor]], married Julius Caesar around 84 BC and died in 69 BC after bearing a daughter [[Julia (daughter of Caesar)|Julia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovano, The Age of Cinna, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinna’s son, the younger [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna (consul 32 BC)|Lucius Cornelius Cinna]], fled Italy when Sulla returned, most likely to Spain. He returned briefly in 78 BC to help in the rebellion of [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 78 BC)|Lepidus]], then again fled to Spain after the plot fell through. He was able to return to Rome in 78 BC due to Lex Plautia, which extended an amnesty to all exiles of the civil war era. The son of this Cinna was [[Gnaeus Cornelius Cinna Magnus]], who was pardoned twice, once after his support for [[Marc Antony]], then again later for conspiracy against the emperor [[Augustus]]. Surprisingly he was then honored as a consul in AD 5 with the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Lovano, The Age of Cinna, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinna's legacy==
Lucius Cornelius Cinna was important within Roman history. He played an important role in the dispute between Gaius Marius and Lucius Sulla, allowing Marius to return to Rome for his seventh consulship. Cinna’s rule was not well documented and many argue that his only goal was his own advancement. His alliance with Marius was to better his interests rather than as a statement of his politics. He attempted to become a tyrant behind a veiled disguise of a republic under a strict constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Bennet, Cinna and His Times, 62 and 65.&lt;/ref&gt; His only real cause was that of the equalization of the Italian groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bennet, Cinna and His Times, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was not as well documented as his contemporaries, Cinna was still an essential player in the fall of the system of the Roman Republic.

'''Offa''' (died 29 July 796 AD) was [[List of monarchs of Mercia|King]] of [[Mercia]], a kingdom of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon England]], from 757 until his death in July 796. The son of Thingfrith and a descendant of [[Eowa of Mercia|Eowa]], Offa came to the throne after a period of civil war following the assassination of [[Æthelbald of Mercia|Æthelbald]]. Offa defeated the other claimant, [[Beornred of Mercia|Beornred]]. In the early years of Offa's reign, it is likely that he consolidated his control of Midland peoples such as the [[Hwicce]] and the [[Magonsæte]]. Taking advantage of instability in the [[kingdom of Kent]] to establish himself as overlord, Offa also controlled [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] by 771, though his authority did not remain unchallenged in either territory. In the 780s he extended [[Mercian Supremacy]] over most of southern England, allying with [[Beorhtric of Wessex]], who married Offa's daughter [[Eadburh]], and regained complete control of the southeast. He also became the overlord of [[Kingdom of the East Angles|East Anglia]] and had King [[Æthelberht II of East Anglia]] beheaded in 794, perhaps for rebelling against him.

Offa was a Christian king who came into conflict with the Church, particularly with [[Jænberht]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Offa persuaded [[Pope Adrian I]] to divide the archdiocese of [[Canterbury]] in two, creating a new [[Bishop of Lichfield|archdiocese of Lichfield]]. This reduction in the power of Canterbury may have been motivated by Offa's desire to have an archbishop consecrate his son [[Ecgfrith of Mercia|Ecgfrith]] as king, since it is possible Jænberht refused to perform the ceremony, which took place in 787. Offa had a dispute with the [[Bishop of Worcester]], which was settled at the Council of [[Brentford]] in 781.

Many surviving coins from Offa's reign carry elegant depictions of him, and the artistic quality of these images exceeds that of the contemporary Frankish coinage. Some of his coins carry images of his wife, [[Cynethryth]]—the only [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] queen ever depicted on a coin. Only three gold coins of Offa's have survived: one is a copy of an [[Abbasid]] dinar of 774 and carries Arabic text on one side, with &quot;Offa Rex&quot; on the other. The gold coins are of uncertain use but may have been struck to be used as alms or for gifts to Rome.

Many historians regard Offa as the most powerful Anglo-Saxon king before [[Alfred the Great]]. His dominance never extended to [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]], though he gave his daughter [[Ælfflæd of Mercia|Ælfflæd]] in marriage to the Northumbrian king [[Æthelred I of Northumbria|Æthelred I]] in 792. Historians once saw his reign as part of a process leading to a unified England, but this is no longer the majority view: in the words of a recent historian, &quot;Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.&quot;&lt;ref name=BEASE_340&gt;Simon Keynes, &quot;Offa&quot;, in ''Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;340.&lt;/ref&gt; Offa died in 796; his son, Ecgfrith, succeeded him, but reigned for less than five months before [[Coenwulf of Mercia]] became king.

==Background and sources==
[[File:British kingdoms c 800.svg|thumb|right|200px|The kingdoms of Britain during Offa's reign]]
[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - Offa Myrcna cyning.jpg|thumb|right|A mention of Offa, the Mercian king, in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'']]
In the first half of the 8th century, the dominant Anglo-Saxon ruler was King [[Æthelbald of Mercia]], who by 731 had become the overlord of all the provinces south of the River [[Humber]].&lt;ref name=Bede_V_23&gt;Bede, ''HE'', V, 23, p.&amp;nbsp;324.&lt;/ref&gt; Æthelbald was one of a number of strong Mercian kings who ruled from the mid-7th century to the early 9th, and it was not until the reign of [[Ecgberht, King of Wessex|Egbert of Wessex]] in the 9th century that Mercian power began to wane.&lt;ref name=BEASE_306&gt;Simon Keynes, &quot;Mercia&quot;, in Lapidge, ''Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;307.&lt;/ref&gt;

The power and prestige that Offa attained made him one of the most significant rulers in [[Early Middle Ages|Early Medieval]] [[Great Britain|Britain]],&lt;ref name=RF_109&gt;Richard Fletcher (''Who's Who'', p.&amp;nbsp;100) describes him as &quot;by common consent the most imposing Anglo-Saxon ruler before Alfred&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; though no contemporary biography of him survives.&lt;ref name=BEASE_306/&gt; A key source for the period is the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', a collection of annals in [[Old English]] narrating the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The ''Chronicle'' was a [[Wessex|West Saxon]] production, however, and is sometimes thought to be biased in favour of Wessex; hence it may not accurately convey the extent of power achieved by Offa, a Mercian.&lt;ref name=CampbellTASS_144&gt;Campbell, ''Anglo-Saxon State'', p.&amp;nbsp;144.&lt;/ref&gt; That power can be seen at work in [[Anglo-Saxon Charters|charters]] dating from Offa's reign. Charters were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen and were witnessed by the kings who had the authority to grant the land.&lt;ref name=BlairRBaEE_14&gt;Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell_95_2&gt;Campbell, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;95–98.&lt;/ref&gt; A charter might record the names of both a subject king and his overlord on the witness list appended to the grant. Such a witness list can be seen on the [[Ismere Diploma]], for example, where Æthelric, son of king Oshere of the Hwicce, is described as a &quot;''subregulus''&quot;, or subking, of Æthelbald's.&lt;ref name=EHD_453&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 67, pp.&amp;nbsp;453–454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell_123&gt;For a discussion showing the use of this in evidence in an account of the progression from Offa's overlordship of the Hwicce to suppression of the ruling dynasty, and consequent absorption of the kingdom into Mercia, see Patrick Wormald, &quot;The Age of Offa and Alcuin&quot;, in Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p.&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt; The eighth-century monk and chronicler the Venerable [[Bede]] wrote a history of the English church called ''[[Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum]]''; the history only covers events up to 731, but as one of the major sources for Anglo-Saxon history it provides important background information for Offa's reign.&lt;ref name=BEASE_57&gt;Roger Ray, &quot;Bede&quot;, in Lapidge et al., ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;57–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Offa's Dyke]], most of which was probably built in his reign, is a testimony to the extensive resources Offa had at his command and his ability to organise them.&lt;ref name=Yorke_117&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt; Other surviving sources include a problematic document known as the [[Tribal Hidage]], which may provide further evidence of Offa's scope as a ruler, though its attribution to his reign is disputed.&lt;ref name=BF_Hidage_29&gt;Peter Featherstone, provides a review of some theories about the origins of the [[Tribal Hidage]] in &quot;The Tribal Hidage and the Ealdormen of Mercia&quot; in Brown &amp; Farr, ''Mercia'', p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant corpus of letters dates from the period, especially from [[Alcuin]], an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade at [[Charlemagne]]'s court as one of his chief advisors, and corresponded with kings, nobles and ecclesiastics throughout England.&lt;ref name=BEASE_24&gt;Michael Lapidge, &quot;Alcuin of York&quot;, in Lapidge et al. ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt; These letters in particular reveal Offa's relations with the continent, as does his [[coin]]age, which was based on [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] examples.&lt;ref name=TAS_110&gt;Patrick Wormald, &quot;The Age of Offa and Alcuin&quot;, in Campbell et al., eds., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;110,&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland ''English Coinage 600–1900'' p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry and family==
[[File:Offa genealogy.svg|thumb|left|Offa's immediate family]]

Offa's ancestry is given in the [[Anglian collection]], a set of genealogies that include lines of descent for four Mercian kings. All four lines descend from [[Pybba of Mercia|Pybba]], who ruled Mercia early in the 7th century. Offa's line descends through Pybba's son [[Eowa of Mercia|Eowa]] and then through three more generations: Osmod, Eanwulf and Offa's father, Thingfrith. Æthelbald, who ruled Mercia for most of the forty years before Offa, was also descended from Eowa according to the genealogies: Offa's grandfather, Eanwulf, was Æthelbald's first cousin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yorke1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Yorke|first=Dr Barbar|title=Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRTy8IrOAGsC|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=5 November 1997|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-16639-3|pages=101, 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Æthelbald granted land to Eanwulf in the territory of the Hwicce, and it is possible that Offa and Æthelbald were from the same branch of the family. In one charter Offa refers to Æthelbald as his kinsman, and Headbert, Æthelbald's brother, continued to witness charters after Offa rose to power.&lt;ref name=Yorke_112&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Kirby_163/&gt;

Offa's wife was [[Cynethryth]], whose ancestry is unknown. The couple had a son, [[Ecgfrith of Mercia|Ecgfrith]], and at least three daughters: Ælfflæd, [[Eadburh]] and Æthelburh.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that Æthelburh was the abbess who was a kinswoman of [[Ealdred, king of the Hwicce|King Ealdred of the Hwicce]], but there are other prominent women named Æthelburh during that period.&lt;ref name=Kirby_163/&gt;

==Early reign, the midland territories and the Middle and East Saxons==
Æthelbald, who had ruled Mercia since 716, was assassinated in 757. According to a later continuation of Bede's ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (written anonymously after Bede's death) the king was &quot;treacherously murdered at night by his own bodyguards,&quot; though the reason why is unrecorded. Æthelbald was initially succeeded by [[Beornred of Mercia|Beornred]], about whom little is known. The continuation of Bede comments that Beornred &quot;ruled for a little while, and unhappily&quot;, and adds that &quot;the same year, Offa, having put Beornred to flight, sought to gain the kingdom of the Mercians by bloodshed.&quot;&lt;ref name=CCEL&gt;The &quot;continuation of Bede&quot; is by other hands than Bede's, though the first few entries may be by Bede himself. See {{cite web | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bede/history.v.v.xxiii.html| title = Bede's Ecclesiastical History of England: Christian Classic Ethereal Library | accessdate=3 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Offa did not gain the throne until 758, however, since a charter of 789 describes Offa as being in the thirty-first year of his reign.&lt;ref name=Kirby_163&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;163.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Offa king of Mercia 757 796 b.jpg|thumb|left|Another coin of Offa]]
The conflict over the succession suggests that Offa needed to re-establish control over Mercia's traditional dependencies, such as the Hwicce and the [[Magonsæte]]. Charters dating from the first two years of Offa's reign show the Hwiccan kings as ''reguli'', or kinglets, under his authority; and it is likely that he was also quick to gain control over the Magonsæte, for whom there is no record of an independent ruler after 740.&lt;ref name=BEASE_340/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby_163/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yorke_113_1&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt; Offa was probably able to exert control over the [[kingdom of Lindsey]] at an early date, as it appears that the independent dynasty of Lindsey had disappeared by this time.&lt;ref name=BEASE_340/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the genealogies, the last king of Lindsey was named Aldfrith, and the identification of this king with an Aldfrith who witnesses a charter of Offa's in 787 led at one time to the belief that Aldfrith was still ruling at that date. However, it is no longer thought that the two Aldfrith's are likely to be the same person. Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the history of the [[Kingdom of Essex|East Saxons]] during the 8th century, but what evidence there is indicates that both London and Middlesex, which had been part of the kingdom of Essex, were finally brought under Mercian control during the reign of Æthelbald. Both Æthelbald and Offa granted land in Middlesex and London as they wished; in 767 a charter of Offa's disposed of land in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] without a local ruler as witness.&lt;ref name=SW_1&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;204–205; the charter itself is translated in Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 73, p.&amp;nbsp;461.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that both London and Middlesex were quickly under Offa's control at the start of his reign.&lt;ref name=Kirby_164&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;164.&lt;/ref&gt; The East Saxon royal house survived the 8th century, so it is probable that the kingdom of Essex retained its native rulers, but under strong Mercian influence, for most or all of the 8th century.&lt;ref name=Yorke_50&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unlikely that Offa had significant influence in the early years of his reign outside the traditional Mercian heartland. The overlordship of the southern English which had been exerted by Æthelbald appears to have collapsed during the civil strife over the succession, and it is not until 764, when evidence emerges of Offa's influence in Kent, that Mercian power can be seen expanding again.&lt;ref name=Stenton_206&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kent and Sussex==
[[File:Offa Kent map.gif|thumb|right|Southeastern England showing locations connected with Offa]]

Offa appears to have exploited an unstable situation in Kent after 762.&lt;ref name=Kirby_165&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;165.&lt;/ref&gt; Kent had a long tradition of joint kingship, with east and west Kent under separate kings, though one king was typically dominant.&lt;ref name=Yorke_32&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 762 Kent was ruled by [[Æthelbert II of Kent|Æthelberht II]] and [[Eadbert I of Kent|Eadberht I]]; Eadberht's son Eardwulf is also recorded as a king. Æthelberht died in 762, and Eadberht and Eardwulf are last mentioned in that same year. Charters from the next two years mention other kings of Kent, including [[Sigered of Kent|Sigered]], [[Eanmund of Kent|Eanmund]] and [[Heaberht of Kent|Heahberht]]. In 764, Offa granted land at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in his own name, with Heahberht on the witness list as king of Kent. Another king of Kent, [[Ecgberht II of Kent|Ecgberht]], appears on a charter in 765 along with Heahberht; the charter was subsequently confirmed by Offa.&lt;ref name=Stenton_206-207&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Offa's influence in Kent at this time is clear, and it has been suggested that Heahberht was installed by Offa as his client.&lt;ref name=Kirby_165/&gt; There is less agreement among historians on whether Offa had general overlordship of Kent thereafter. He is known to have revoked a charter of Ecgberht's on the grounds that &quot;it was wrong that his thegn should have presumed to give land allotted to him by his lord into the power of another without his witness&quot;, but the date of Ecgberht's original grant is unknown, as is the date of Offa's revocation of it.&lt;ref name=EHD_80&gt;The evidence comes from a charter of [[Coenwulf of Mercia]]'s in 799, in which he grants the land again, quoting the grounds on which Offa revoked it, but without giving any date. The charter is translated in Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 80, p.&amp;nbsp;470.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that Offa was the effective overlord of Kent from 764 until at least 776. The limited evidence for Offa's direct involvement in the kingdom between 765 and 776 includes two charters of 774 in which he grants land in Kent; but there are doubts about their authenticity, so Offa's intervention in Kent prior to 776 may have been limited to the years 764–65.&lt;ref name=KSB_1&gt;Kirby quotes Stenton's comment that Ecgberht was &quot;a mere dependant&quot; of Offa's, and gives his opinion that there is &quot;no certain evidence&quot; of this. On the other hand, Keynes agrees with Stenton that Offa &quot;[took] control of Kent in the 760s&quot;. Simon Keynes, &quot;Offa&quot;, in Lapidge, ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;340; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;207; Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp.&amp;nbsp;165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' records that &quot;the Mercians and the inhabitants of Kent fought at [[Otford]]&quot; in 776, but does not give the outcome of the battle. It has traditionally been interpreted as a Mercian victory, but there is no evidence for Offa's authority over Kent until 785: a charter from 784 mentions only a Kentish king named [[Ealhmund of Kent|Ealhmund]], which may indicate that the Mercians were in fact defeated at Otford.&lt;ref name=KS_1&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;207–208; Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;165.&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the conflict is also unknown: if Offa was ruling Kent before 776, the battle of Otford was probably a rebellion against Mercian control.&lt;ref name=BEASE_340/&gt; However, Ealhmund does not appear again in the historical record, and a sequence of charters by Offa from the years 785–89 makes his authority clear. During these years he treated Kent &quot;as an ordinary province of the Mercian kingdom&quot;,&lt;ref name=KS_2&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp.&amp;nbsp;166–167; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;207–208.&lt;/ref&gt; and his actions have been seen as going beyond the normal relation of overlordship and extending to the annexation of Kent and the elimination of a local royal line. After 785, in the words of one historian, &quot;Offa was the rival, not the overlord, of Kentish kings&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kirby_W_167&gt;The quote is from Patrick Wormald, &quot;Bede, the ''Bretwaldas'', and the origin of the ''Gens Anglorum''&quot;, in Wormald et al., ''Ideal and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;113, quoted in Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;167.&lt;/ref&gt; Mercian control lasted until 796, the year of Offa's death, when [[Eadberht II|Eadberht Præn]] was temporarily successful in regaining Kentish independence.&lt;ref&gt;The Chronicle doesn't make it clear whether Eadberht casme to the throne after Offa's death, or after Ecgfrith's. Stenton suggests that the revolt in Kent began prior to Offa's death. See Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp.&amp;nbsp;56–57; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;225; Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ealhmund was probably the father of [[Ecgberht, King of Wessex|Egbert of Wessex]], and it is possible that Offa's interventions in Kent in the mid-780s are connected to the subsequent exile of Egbert to Francia. The ''Chronicle'' claims that when Egbert invaded Kent in 825, the men of the southeast turned to him &quot;because earlier they were wrongly forced away from his relatives&quot;.&lt;ref name=Swanton_60&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely to be an allusion to Ealhmund, and may imply that Ealhmund had a local overlordship of the southeastern kingdoms. If so, Offa's intervention was probably intended to gain control of this relationship and take over the dominance of the associated kingdoms.&lt;ref name=Kirby_168&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for Offa's involvement in the [[kingdom of Sussex]] comes from charters, and as with Kent there is no clear consensus among historians on the course of events. What little evidence survives that bears on Sussex's kings indicates that several kings ruled at once, and it may never have formed a single kingdom. It has been argued that Offa's authority was recognised early in his reign by local kings in western Sussex, but that eastern Sussex (the area around Hastings) submitted to him less readily. [[Symeon of Durham]], a twelfth-century chronicler, records that in 771 Offa defeated &quot;the people of Hastings&quot;, which may record the extension of Offa's dominion over the entire kingdom.&lt;ref name=SW_2&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;208; Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', p.&amp;nbsp;243.&lt;/ref&gt; However, doubts have been expressed about the authenticity of the charters which support this version of events, and it is possible that Offa's direct involvement in Sussex was limited to a short period around 770–71. After 772, there is no further evidence of Mercian involvement in Sussex until c. 790, and it may be that Offa gained control of Sussex in the late 780s, as he did in Kent.&lt;ref name=Kirby_167-8&gt;Kirby gives details of the problems with the charters, and also suggests that the situation in Kent and Sussex at this time may be connected with the entry for 823 in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' which asserts that the southeastern kingdoms were &quot;wrongly forced away&quot; from the kinsmen of [[Egbert of Wessex]], who was the son of king [[Ealhmund of Kent]]. Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp.&amp;nbsp;167–168; see also Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt;

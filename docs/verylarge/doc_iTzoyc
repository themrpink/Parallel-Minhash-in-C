{{Main article|Literary genre|List of literary genres}}
A literary genre is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by [[literary technique]], [[setting tone|tone]], [[Content (media)|content]], or even (as in the case of fiction) length. Genre should not be confused with age category, by which literature may be classified as either adult, [[young adult fiction|young adult]], or [[children's literature|children's]].  They also must not be confused with format, such as [[graphic novel]] or picture book. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups.

The most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) [[epic poetry|epic]], [[tragedy]],&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1983, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[comedy]], [[novel]], and [[short story]]. They can all be in the genres [[prose]] or [[poetry]], which shows best how loosely genres are defined. Additionally, a genre such as [[satire]] might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general [[cultural movement]] of the [[historical period]] in which they were composed.  In [[popular fiction]], which is especially divided by genres, [[genre fiction]] is the more usual term.

In [[literature]], genre has been known as an intangible [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].  This taxonomy implies a concept of containment or that an idea will be stable forever. The earliest recorded systems of genre in [[Western world|Western history]] can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. Gérard Genette, a French literary theorist and author of ''The Architext'', describes Plato as creating three Imitational genres: dramatic dialogue, pure narrative, and [[Epic (genre)|epic]] (a mixture of dialogue and narrative). [[Lyric poetry]], the fourth and final type of [[Greek literature]], was excluded by Plato as a non-mimetic mode. Aristotle later revised Plato's system by eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode and distinguishing by two additional criteria: the object to be imitated, as objects could be either superior or inferior, and the medium of presentation such as words, gestures or verse.  Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium can be visualized along an XYZ axis.

Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]] (superior-dramatic dialogue), [[epic poetry|epic]] (superior-mixed narrative), [[comedy]] (inferior-dramatic dialogue), and [[parody]] (inferior-mixed narrative). Genette continues by explaining the later integration of lyric poetry into the classical system during the [[Romanticism|romantic period]], replacing the now removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third leg of a new tripartite system: lyrical, epical, and dramatic dialogue. This system, which came to &quot;dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism (and therefore well beyond)…&quot; (38), has seen numerous attempts at expansion or revision. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing scope and complexity.

Genette reflects upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: &quot;its structure is somewhat superior to…those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse&quot; (74). Taxonomy allows for a structured classification system of genre, as opposed to a more contemporary rhetorical model of genre.

==Film==
{{main article|Film genre}}
The basic genres of film can be regarded as drama, in the [[feature film]] and most [[cartoon]]s, and [[documentary]].  Most dramatic feature films, especially from [[Hollywood]] fall fairly comfortably into one of a long list of film genres such as the [[Western film|Western]], [[war film]], [[horror film]], [[romantic comedy|romantic comedy film]], [[musical film|musical]], [[crime film]], and many others. Many of these genres have a number of subgenres, for example by setting or subject, or a distinctive national style, for example in the Indian [[Bollywood]] musical.

==Music==
{{main article|Music genre}}
A '''music genre''' is a conventional category that identifies pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Samson, Jim. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40599 &quot;Genre&quot;]. In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Accessed March 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} There are numerous genres in Western [[classical music]] and [[popular music]], as well as [[musical theatre]] and the music of non-Western cultures. The term is now perhaps over-used to describe relatively small differences in musical style in modern [[rock music]], that also may reflect sociological differences in their audiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Timothy Laurie suggests that in the context of rock and pop music studies, the &quot;appeal of genre criticism is that it makes narratives out of musical worlds that often seem to lack them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurie 2014&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.5130/csr.v20i2.4149 | title= Music Genre as Method| year= 2014| last1= Laurie| first1= Timothy| journal= Cultural Studies Review| volume= 20| issue= 2| doi-access= free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music can be divided into different genres in several ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often arbitrary and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are several academic approaches to genres. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. According to Green, &quot;Beethoven's ''Op. 61'' and Mendelssohn's ''Op. 64'' are identical in genre&amp;nbsp;– both are violin concertos&amp;nbsp;– but different in form. However, Mozart's ''Rondo for Piano, K. 511'', and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his ''Mass, K. 317'' are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Form in Tonal Music |last=Green |first=Douglass M. |year=1965 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc |isbn=0-03-020286-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or &quot;basic musical language&quot;.&lt;ref name=Pete&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music |last=van der Merwe |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist) |year=1989 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-316121-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3 3] |url=https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, Allan F.
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3526163 &quot;Categorical Conventions in Music Discourse: Style and Genre&quot;]. ''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 82, No. 3 (Aug. 2001), pp. 432–442.&lt;/ref&gt; A music genre or subgenre may be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the styles, the context, and content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres.

Several music scholars have criticised the priority accorded to genre-based communities and listening practices. For example, Laurie argues that &quot;music genres do not belong to isolated, self-sufficient communities. People constantly move between environments where diverse forms of music are heard, advertised and accessorised with distinctive iconographies, narratives and celebrity identities that also touch on non-musical worlds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurie 2014&quot;/&gt;

==Popular culture and other media==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The concept of genre is often applied, sometimes rather loosely, to other media with an artistic element, such as [[video game genres]]. Genre, and numerous minutely divided subgenres, affect popular culture very significantly, not least as they are used to classify it for publicity purposes.  The vastly increased output of popular culture in the age of electronic media encourages dividing cultural products by genre to simplify the search for products by consumers, a trend the Internet has only intensified.

==Linguistics==
In [[philosophy of language]], genre figures prominently in the works of philosopher and literary scholar [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]. Bakhtin's basic observations were of &quot;speech genres&quot; (the idea of [[heteroglossia]]), modes of speaking or writing that people learn to mimic, weave together, and manipulate (such as &quot;formal letter&quot; and &quot;grocery list&quot;, or &quot;university lecture&quot; and &quot;personal anecdote&quot;). In this sense, genres are socially specified: recognized and defined (often informally) by a particular culture or community. The work of [[Georg Lukács]] also touches on the nature of [[literary genre]]s, appearing separately but around the same time (1920s–1930s) as Bakhtin. [[Norman Fairclough]] has a similar concept of genre that emphasizes the social context of the text: Genres are &quot;different ways of (inter)acting discoursally&quot; (Fairclough, 2003: 26).

A text's genre may be determined by its:

# Linguistic function.
# Formal traits.
# Textual organization.
# Relation of communicative situation to formal and organizational traits of the text (Charaudeau and Maingueneau, 2002:278–280).

==Rhetoric==
In the field of [[rhetoric]], genre theorists usually understand genres as types of actions rather than types or forms of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi, A. S., &amp; Mary Jo Reiff. (2010). [http://wac.colostate.edu/books/bawarshi_reiff/ Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy.] chs. 5 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; On this perspective, texts are channels through which genres are enacted. Carolyn Miller's&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. R. (1984). Genre as social action. Quarterly Journal of Speech, 70(2), 151–167.&lt;/ref&gt; work has been especially important for this perspective. Drawing on [[Lloyd Bitzer]]'s concept of rhetorical situation,&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, L. F. (1968). The Rhetorical Situation. Philosophy and Rhetoric, 1(1), 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller reasons that recurring rhetorical problems tend to elicit recurring responses; drawing on [[Alfred Schütz]],&lt;ref&gt;Schutz, A., &amp; Luckmann, T. (1973). The Structures of the Life-World. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; she reasons that these recurring responses become &quot;typified&quot; – that is, socially constructed as recognizable types. Miller argues that these &quot;typified rhetorical actions&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;151) are properly understood as genres.

Building off of Miller, [[Charles Bazerman]] and Clay Spinuzzi have argued that genres understood as actions derive their meaning from other genres – that is, other actions. Bazerman therefore proposes that we analyze genres in terms of &quot;genre systems&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, C. (1994). Systems of Genre and the Enactment of Social Intentions. In Genre and the New Rhetoric (pp. 79–101). London/Bristol: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; while Spinuzzi prefers the closely related concept of &quot;genre ecologies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi, C., &amp; Zachry, M. (2000). Genre Ecologies : An Open-System Approach to Understanding and Constructing Documentation. ACM Journal of Computer Documentation, 24(3), 169–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition has had implications for the teaching of writing in American colleges and universities. Combining rhetorical genre theory with [[activity theory]], David Russell has proposed that standard English composition courses are ill-suited to teach the genres that students will write in other contexts across the university and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, D. R. (1995). Activity theory and its implications for writing instruction. In J. Petraglia (Ed.), Reconceiving writing, rethinking writing instruction (pp. 51–78). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Wardle contends that standard composition courses do teach genres, but that these are inauthentic &quot;mutt genres&quot; that are often of little use outside of composition courses.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, E. (2009). &quot;Mutt Genres&quot; and the Goal of FYC: Can we Help Students Write the Genres of the University? College Composition and Communication, 60(4), 765–789.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This concept of genre originated from the classification systems created by [[Plato]]. Plato divided [[literature]] into the three classic genres accepted in [[Ancient Greece]]: [[poetry]], [[drama]], and [[prose]]. [[Poetry]] is further subdivided into [[epic poetry|epic]], [[lyric poetry|lyric]], and [[drama]]. The divisions are recognized as being set by [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]; however, they were not the only ones. Many genre theorists added to these accepted forms of [[poetry]].

===Classical and Romance genre theory===
The earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle#Rhetoric and poetics|Aristotle]]. [[Gérard Genette]] explains his interpretation of the history of genre in &quot;The Architext&quot;. He described Plato as the creator of three imitational, mimetic genres distinguished by mode of imitation rather than content. These three imitational genres include dramatic dialogue, the [[drama]]; pure narrative, the [[dithyramb]]; and a mixture of the two, the [[Epic (genre)|epic]]. Plato excluded [[lyric poetry]] as a non-mimetic, imitational mode. Genette further discussed how Aristotle revised Plato's system by first eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode. He then uses two additional criteria to distinguish the system. The first of the criteria is the object to be imitated, whether superior or inferior. The second criterion is the medium of presentation: words, gestures, or verse. Essentially, the three categories of [[mode (literature)|mode]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], and [[Medium (communication)|medium]] can be visualized along an XYZ axis. Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]], [[Epic (genre)|epic]], [[comedy]], and [[parody]].

Genette explained the integration of lyric poetry into the classical system by replacing the removed pure narrative mode. [[Lyric poetry]], once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third &quot;Architext&quot;, a term coined by Gennette, of a new long-enduring tripartite system: lyrical; epical, the mixed narrative; and dramatic, the dialogue. This new system that came to &quot;dominate all the literary theory of [[German romanticism]]&quot; (Genette 38) has seen numerous attempts at expansion and revision. Such attempts include [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel's]] triad of subjective form, the lyric; objective form, the dramatic; and subjective-objective form, the epic. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing complexity. Gennette reflected upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: &quot;its structure is somewhat superior to most of those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse&quot;.

==Culture==
Genre is embedded in [[culture]] but may clash with it at times. There are occasions in which a cultural group may not be inclined to keep within the set structures of a genre. Anthony Pare's studied Inuit social workers in &quot;Genre and Identity: Individuals, Institutions and Ideology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pare, Anthony (2002). &quot;Genre and Identity: Individuals, Institutions, and Ideology.&quot; In Richard Coe, Lorelei Lingard, and Tatiana Teslenko (Eds.),''The Rhetoric and Ideology of Genre (''pp. 57-71). Hampton Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, Pare described the conflict between the genre of Inuit social workers' record keeping forms and the cultural values that prohibited them from fully being able to fulfill the expectations of this genre. Amy Devitt further expands on the concept of culture in her 2004 essay, &quot;A Theory of Genre&quot; by adding &quot;culture defines what situations and genres are likely or possible&quot; (Devitt 24).

Genre not only coexists with culture but also defines its very components. Genres abound in daily life and people often work within them unconsciously; people often take for granted their prominence and ever present residence in society. Devitt touches on Miller's idea of situation, but expands on it and adds that the relationship with genre and situation is reciprocal. Individuals may find themselves shaping the rhetorical situations, which in turn affect the rhetorical responses that arise out of the situation. Because the social workers worked closely with different families, they did not want to disclose many of the details that are standard in the genre of record keeping related to this field. Giving out such information would violate close cultural ties with the members of their community.

==Audiences==
Although genres are not always precisely definable, genre considerations are one of the most important factors in determining what a person will see or read. The classification properties of genre can attract or repel potential users depending on the individual's understanding of a genre.

Genre creates an expectation in that expectation is met or not. Many genres have built-in audiences and corresponding publications that support them, such as [[magazine]]s and websites. Inversely, audiences may call out for change in an antecedent genre and create an entirely new genre.

The term may be used in categorizing [[web page]]s, like &quot;news page&quot; and &quot;fan page&quot;, with both very different layout, audience, and intention (Rosso, 2008). Some search engines like [[Vivísimo]] try to group found web pages into automated categories in an attempt to show various genres the search hits might fit.

==Subgenre==
A subgenre is a [[Hierarchy|subordinate]] within a genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subgenre|title=subgenre|dictionary=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/subgenre|title=Subgenre|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two stories being the same genre can still sometimes differ in subgenre. For example, if a [[fantasy]] story has darker and more frightening elements of fantasy, it would belong in the subgenre of [[dark fantasy]]; whereas another fantasy story that features [[magic sword]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]] would belong to the subgenre of [[sword and sorcery]].

==Microgenre==
{{Main|Microgenre}}A [[Microgenre]] is a highly specialized, narrow classification of a cultural practice. The term has come into usage in the 21st century and most commonly refers to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2015/10/08/timeline-history-of-music-microgenres-chillwave-cloud-rap-witch-house|title=A Recent History of Microgenres|website=The FADER|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also associated with the hyper-specific categories used in recommendations for television shows and movies on digital streaming platforms such as [[Netflix]], and is sometimes used more broadly by scholars analyzing niche forms in other periods and other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The microgenre : a quick look at small culture|others=O'Donnell, Molly C.,, Stevens, Anne H., 1971-|year=2020|isbn=978-1-5013-4584-5|location=New York|oclc=1139150914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used in analogy to [[ferromagnetism]], in which a material exhibits a permanent [[magnetic moment]].

Materials that are both ferroelectric ''and'' ferromagnetic are known as [[multiferroics]].

==Polarization==
[[Image:Dielectric polarisation.svg|right|frame|Linear dielectric polarization]]
[[Image:Paraelectric polarisation.svg|right|frame|Paraelectric polarization]]
[[Image:Ferroelectric polarisation.svg|right|frame|Ferroelectric polarization]]
When most materials are polarized, the polarization induced, ''P'', is almost exactly proportional to the applied external electric field ''E''; so the polarization is a linear function.  This is called linear dielectric polarization (see figure). Some materials, known as [[Paraelectricity|paraelectric]] materials,&lt;ref&gt;[[Chiang, Y. et al.]]: Physical Ceramics, ''[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]'' 1997, New York&lt;/ref&gt; show a more enhanced nonlinear polarization (see figure). The electric [[permittivity]], corresponding to the slope of the polarization curve, is not constant as in linear dielectrics but is a function of the external electric field.

In addition to being nonlinear, ferroelectric materials demonstrate a spontaneous nonzero polarization (after entrainment, see figure) even when the applied field ''E'' is zero. The distinguishing feature of ferroelectrics is that the spontaneous polarization can be ''reversed'' by a suitably strong applied electric field in the opposite direction; the polarization is therefore dependent not only on the current electric field but also on its history, yielding a [[hysteresis]] loop.  They are called ferroelectrics by analogy to [[ferromagnetic]] materials, which have spontaneous [[magnetization]] and exhibit similar hysteresis loops.

Typically, materials demonstrate ferroelectricity only below a certain phase transition temperature, called the [[Curie temperature#Curie temperature in ferroelectric materials|Curie temperature]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) and are paraelectric above this temperature: the spontaneous polarization vanishes, and the ferroelectric crystal transforms into the paraelectric state. Many ferroelectrics lose their piezoelectric properties above Tc completely, because their paraelectric phase has a centrosymmetric crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Safari|first1=Ahmad|title=Piezoelectric and acoustic materials for transducer applications|date=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0387765402|page=21|bibcode=2008pamt.book.....S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The nonlinear nature of ferroelectric materials can be used to make capacitors with tunable capacitance. Typically, a [[ferroelectric capacitor]] simply consists of a pair of electrodes sandwiching a layer of ferroelectric material. The permittivity of ferroelectrics is not only tunable but commonly also very high in absolute value, especially when close to the phase transition temperature. Because of this, ferroelectric capacitors are small in physical size compared to dielectric (non-tunable) capacitors of similar capacitance.

The spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric materials implies a [[hysteresis]] effect which can be used as a memory function, and ferroelectric capacitors are indeed used to make [[ferroelectric RAM]]&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{Cite book|author=J.F. Scott |title= Ferroelectric Memories |publisher=Springer |year=2000|isbn=978-3-540-66387-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; for computers and [[RFID]] cards. In these applications thin films of ferroelectric materials are typically used, as this allows the field required to switch the polarization to be achieved with a moderate voltage. However, when using thin films a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the interfaces, electrodes and sample quality for devices to work reliably.&lt;ref name=Dawber&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=M.

Ferroelectric materials are required by symmetry considerations to be also piezoelectric and pyroelectric. The combined properties of memory, [[piezoelectricity]], and [[pyroelectricity]] make ferroelectric capacitors very useful, e.g. for sensor applications. Ferroelectric capacitors are used in medical ultrasound machines (the capacitors generate and then listen for the ultrasound ping used to image the internal organs of a body), high quality infrared cameras (the infrared image is projected onto a two dimensional array of ferroelectric capacitors capable of detecting temperature differences as small as millionths of a degree Celsius), fire sensors, sonar, vibration sensors, and even fuel injectors on diesel engines.

Another idea of recent interest is the ''ferroelectric tunnel junction'' (''FTJ'') in which a contact is made up by nanometer-thick ferroelectric film placed between metal electrodes.&lt;ref name=ftj&gt;{{Cite journal

Yet another hot topic is [[multiferroics]], where researchers are looking for ways to couple magnetic and ferroelectric ordering within a material or heterostructure; there are several recent reviews on this topic.&lt;ref name=ferroics&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=R.|last1=Ramesh|first2=N.A|last2=Spaldin|author2-link=Nicola Spaldin|journal= Nature Materials |volume= 6 |year=2007|bibcode = 2007NatMa...6...21R |doi = 10.1038/nmat1805 |pmid=17199122|issue=1|pages=21–9|title=Multiferroics: Progress and prospects in thin films}}{{Cite journal|author1=W.

==Materials==
The internal electric dipoles of a ferroelectric material are coupled to the material lattice so anything that changes the lattice will change the strength of the dipoles (in other words, a change in the spontaneous polarization).  The change in the spontaneous polarization results in a change in the surface charge.  This can cause current flow in the case of a ferroelectric capacitor even without the presence of an external voltage across the capacitor. Two stimuli that will change the lattice dimensions of a material are force and temperature. The generation of a surface charge in response to the application of an external stress to a material is called [[piezoelectricity]]. A change in the spontaneous polarization of a material in response to a change in temperature is called [[pyroelectricity]].

Generally, there are 230 [[space group]]s among which 32 [[Crystal system#Crystal classes|crystalline classes]] can be found in crystals. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, within which 20 are [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]]. Among the piezoelectric classes, 10 have a spontaneous electric polarization, that varies with the temperature, therefore they are [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]]. Among pyroelectric materials, some of them are ferroelectric.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Ferroelectric phase transitions are often characterized as either displacive (such as BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or order-disorder (such as NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), though often phase transitions will demonstrate elements of both behaviors. In [[barium titanate]], a typical ferroelectric of the displacive type, the transition can be understood in terms of a [[polarization catastrophe]], in which, if an ion is displaced from equilibrium slightly, the force from the local [[electric field]]s due to the ions in the crystal increases faster than the elastic-restoring [[force (physics)|force]]s. This leads to an asymmetrical shift in the equilibrium ion positions and hence to a permanent dipole moment. The ionic displacement in barium titanate concerns the relative position of the titanium ion within the oxygen octahedral cage.  In [[lead titanate]], another key ferroelectric material, although the structure is rather similar to barium titanate the driving force for ferroelectricity is more complex with interactions between the lead and oxygen ions also playing an important role. In an order-disorder ferroelectric, there is a dipole moment in each unit cell, but at high temperatures they are pointing in random directions. Upon lowering the temperature and going through the phase transition, the dipoles order, all pointing in the same direction within a domain.

An important ferroelectric material for applications is [[lead zirconate titanate]] (PZT), which is part of the solid solution formed between ferroelectric lead titanate and [[anti-ferroelectric]] lead zirconate. Different compositions are used for different applications; for memory applications, PZT closer in composition to lead titanate is preferred, whereas piezoelectric applications make use of the diverging piezoelectric coefficients associated with the morphotropic phase boundary that is found close to the 50/50 composition.

Ferroelectric [[crystals]] often show several [[transition temperature]]s and [[Hysteresis#Electrical hysteresis|domain structure hysteresis]], much as do [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] crystals. The nature of the [[phase transition]] in some ferroelectric crystals is still not well understood.

In 1974 [[R.B. Meyer]] used symmetry arguments to predict ferroelectric [[liquid crystals]],&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Noel A. |last2=Lagerwall |first2=Sven T. |title=Submicrosecond bistable electro‐optic switching in liquid crystals |journal=Applied Physics Letters |date=June 1980 |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=899–901 |doi=10.1063/1.91359 |bibcode=1980ApPhL..36..899C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the prediction could immediately be verified by several observations of behavior connected to ferroelectricity in smectic liquid-crystal phases that are chiral and tilted. The technology allows the building of flat-screen monitors. Mass production between 1994 and 1999 was carried out by Canon. Ferroelectric liquid crystals are used in production of reflective [[LCoS]].

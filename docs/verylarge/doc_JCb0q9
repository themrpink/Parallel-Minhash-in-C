Bits also differ by the diameter of their shank, with ½ inch, 12mm, 10mm, ⅜&amp;nbsp;inch, 8mm and ¼ inch and 6mm shanks (ordered from thickest to thinnest) being the most common. Half-inch bits cost more but, being stiffer, are less prone to vibration (giving smoother cuts) and are less likely to break than the smaller sizes. Care must be taken to ensure the bit shank and router collet sizes match exactly. Failure to do so can cause permanent damage to either or both and can lead to the dangerous situation of the bit coming out of the collet during operation. Many routers come with removable collets for the popular shank sizes (in the USA ½-in and ¼-in, in Great Britain ½-in, 8mm and ¼-in, and metric sizes in Europe—although in the [[United States]] the ⅜-in and 8mm sizes are often only available for an extra cost).

Many modern routers allow the speed of the bit's rotation to be varied. A slower rotation allows bits of larger cutting diameter to be used safely. Typical speeds range from 8,000 to 30,000 rpm.

Router bits can be made to match almost any imaginable profile. Custom router bits can be ordered. They are especially beneficial for home restoration projects, where production of the original trim and molding has been discontinued.

Sometimes complementary bits come in sets designed to facilitate the joinery used in [[frame and panel]] construction. One bit is designed to cut the grove in the rail and stile pieces while the other shapes the edge of the panel to fit in the grove.

== CNC router ==
A [[CNC wood router]] is a computer controlled machine to which the router or spindle mounts. The CNC Machine can be either a moving gantry style, where the table is fixed and the router spindle moves over it, or fixed bridge design, where the table moves underneath the router spindle, or hand-held style, where the operator moves the machine to the area to be cut and the machine controls the fine adjustments. [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] software programming is used to model the part that is to be created in the computer and then create a tool path for the machine to follow to cut out the part. The CNC moves along three axes (X-Y-Z). Most CNC routers have a three motor drive system utilizing either servo or stepper motors. More advanced routers use a four motor system for added speed and accuracy.

== Similar tools ==
A tool similar to a router, but designed to hold smaller cutting bits—thereby making it easier to handle for small jobs—is a [[laminate trimmer]].

A related tool, called a ''spindle moulder'' (UK) or [[wood shaper|shaper]] (North America), is used to hold ''larger'' cutter heads and can be used for deeper or larger-diameter cuts. Another related machine is the pin router, a larger static version of the hand electric router but normally with a much more powerful motor and other features such as automatic template copying.

Some profile cutters use a cutting head reminiscent of a spindle router. These should not be confused with profile cutters used for steel plate which use a flame as the cutting method.

===Classification===
{{See also|Flight feather|Down feather}}
There are two basic types of feather: vaned feathers which cover the exterior of the body, and [[down feather]]s which are underneath the vaned feathers. The [[pennaceous feather]]s are vaned feathers. Also called contour feathers, pennaceous feathers arise from tracts and cover the entire body. A third rarer type of feather, the filoplume, is hairlike and (if present in a bird; they are entirely absent in [[ratite]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chandler, A. C. |year=1916| title=A study of the structure of feathers, with reference to their taxonomic significance|publisher=University of California| place= Berkeley| url=https://archive.org/stream/studyofstructure00chan#page/284/mode/1up|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are closely associated with pennaceous feathers and are often entirely hidden by them, with one or two filoplumes attached and sprouting from near the same point of the skin as each pennaceous feather, at least on a bird's head, neck and trunk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nitzsch1867&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Nitzsch |first=Christian Ludwig |title=Nitzsch's Pterylography |url=https://archive.org/details/nitzschspterylog00nitzrich |year=1867 |publisher=Ray Society |page=[https://archive.org/details/nitzschspterylog00nitzrich/page/14 14] |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandler261&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1916|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some passerines, filoplumes arise exposed beyond the pennaceous feathers on the neck.&lt;ref name=Prum2002/&gt; The remiges, or [[flight feather]]s of the wing, and rectrices, or flight feathers of the tail, are the most important feathers for flight. A typical vaned feather features a main shaft, called the [[rachis]]. Fused to the rachis are a series of branches, or '''barbs'''; the barbs themselves are also branched and form the '''barbules'''. These barbules have minute hooks called '''barbicels''' for cross-attachment. Down feathers are fluffy because they lack barbicels, so the barbules float free of each other, allowing the down to trap air and provide excellent thermal insulation. At the base of the feather, the rachis expands to form the hollow tubular ''calamus'' (or [[quill]]) which inserts into a [[Hair follicle|follicle]] in the [[skin]]. The basal part of the calamus is without vanes. This part is embedded within the skin follicle and has an opening at the base (proximal umbilicus) and a small opening on the side (distal umbilicus).&lt;ref name=atlas&gt;{{Cite book|title=A color atlas of avian anatomy|last= McLelland| first=J.|publisher=W.B.

Hatchling birds of some species have a special kind of natal down feathers (neossoptiles) which are pushed out when the normal feathers (teleoptiles) emerge.&lt;ref name=Prum2002 /&gt;

Flight feathers are stiffened so as to work against the air in the downstroke but yield in other directions. It has been observed that the orientation pattern of β-keratin fibers in the feathers of flying birds differs from that in flightless birds: the fibers are better aligned along the shaft axis direction towards the tip,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Cameron| first1= G.|last2=Wess|first2= T. |last3= Bonser |first3=R.|year=2003|title=Young's modulus varies with differential orientation of keratin in feathers |journal=Journal of Structural Biology| volume= 143| issue= 2|pages=118–23|doi=10.1016/S1047-8477(03)00142-4|pmid=12972348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1= Bonser| first1= R.| last2= Saker|first2= L.| last3= Jeronimidis |first3= G. |year=2004 |title=Toughness anisotropy in feather keratin |journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume=39|issue=8|pages=2895–2896| doi=10.1023/B:JMSC.0000021474.75864.ff| bibcode = 2004JMatS..39.2895B | s2cid= 135873731}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lateral walls of rachis region show structure of crossed fibers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang 2016 1600360&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Bin |title=Light like a feather: A fibrous natural composite with a shape changing from round to square |journal=Advanced Science |volume=4 |issue=3 |year=2016 |doi=10.1002/advs.201600360 |pmid=28331789 |page=1600360|pmc=5357985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lingham-Soliar |first=Theagarten |title=A new helical crossed-fibre structure of b-keratin in flight feathers and its biomechanical implications |journal=PLOS ONE |year=2013 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0065849 |pmid=23762440 |volume=8 |issue=6 |page=e65849|bibcode=2013PLoSO...865849L |pmc=3677936 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functions===
Feathers insulate birds from water and cold temperatures. They may also be plucked to line the nest and provide insulation to the eggs and young. The individual feathers in the wings and tail play important roles in controlling flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang 2016 1600360&quot;/&gt; Some species have a [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] of feathers on their heads. Although feathers are light, a bird's plumage weighs two or three times more than its skeleton, since many bones are hollow and contain air sacs. Color patterns serve as [[camouflage]] against [[predator]]s for birds in their habitats, and serve as camouflage for predators looking for a meal. As with fish, the top and bottom colors may be different, in order to provide camouflage during flight. Striking differences in feather patterns and colors are part of the [[sexual dimorphism]] of many bird species and are particularly important in selection of mating pairs. In some cases there are differences in the UV reflectivity of feathers across sexes even though no differences in color are noted in the visible range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The ubiquity of avian ultraviolet plumage reflectance|first1= Muir D. |last1= Eaton |first2= Scott M. |last2= Lanyon|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences| volume= 270| issue= 1525| year= 2003| pages=1721–1726|doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2431|pmid=12965000|pmc=1691429}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wing feathers of male [[club-winged manakin]]s ''Machaeropterus deliciosus'' have special structures that are used to produce sounds by [[stridulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title= Courting Bird Sings with Stridulating Wing Feathers| last1= Bostwick| first1= Kimberly S.| last2= Richard O.| first2= Prum| year= 2005| journal= Science| volume= 309| issue= 5735| pages= 736| doi= 10.1126/science.1111701| pmid= 16051789| s2cid= 22278735| url= http://cumv.bio.cornell.edu/pdf/Bostwick_Prum_2005_manuscript.pdf| access-date= 19 July 2010| url-status= live| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100707152805/http://cumv.bio.cornell.edu/pdf/Bostwick_Prum_2005_manuscript.pdf| archive-date= 7 July 2010| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GuineaFeather.jpg|thumb|left|A contour feather from a [[Guinea fowl]]]]
Some birds have a supply of [[powder down]] feathers which grow continuously, with small particles regularly breaking off from the ends of the barbules. These particles produce a [[Powder (substance)|powder]] that sifts through the feathers on the bird's body and acts as a waterproofing agent and a feather [[conditioner (chemistry)|conditioner]]. Powder down has evolved independently in several taxa and can be found in down as well as in pennaceous feathers. They may be scattered in plumage as in the pigeons and parrots or in localized patches on the breast, belly, or flanks, as in herons and frogmouths. Herons use their bill to break the powder down feathers and to spread them, while cockatoos may use their head as a powder puff to apply the powder.&lt;ref name=delhey/&gt; Waterproofing can be lost by exposure to [[emulsion|emulsifying agents]] due to human pollution. Feathers can then become waterlogged, causing the bird to sink. It is also very difficult to clean and rescue birds whose feathers have been fouled by [[oil spill]]s. The feathers of cormorants soak up water and help to reduce buoyancy, thereby allowing the birds to swim submerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1= Ribak| first1= G.| last2= Weihs| first2= D. | last3= Arad| first3= Z.|year=2005|title=Water retention in the plumage of diving great cormorants ''Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis''|journal=J.

[[Bristle]]s are stiff, tapering feathers with a large rachis but few barbs. '''Rictal bristles''' are found around the eyes and bill. They may serve a similar purpose to [[eyelash]]es and [[vibrissae]] in [[mammal]]s. Although there is as yet no clear evidence, it has been suggested that rictal bristles have sensory functions and may help insectivorous birds to capture prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v084n02/p0193-p0197.pdf |title=The role of avian rictal bristles |last=Lederer |first=Roger J. |year=1972 |journal=[[The Wilson Bulletin]] |volume=84 |pages=193–97 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204025111/http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v084n02/p0193-p0197.pdf |archive-date=4 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, willow flycatchers (''[[Empidonax traillii]]'') were found to catch insects equally well before and after removal of the rictal bristles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/103116|last1=Conover|first1=M.

[[Grebe]]s are peculiar in their habit of ingesting their own feathers and feeding them to their young. Observations on their diet of fish and the frequency of feather eating suggest that ingesting feathers, particularly down from their flanks, aids in forming easily ejectable pellets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Feather eating in Great Crested Grebes ''Podiceps cristatus'': a unique solution to the problems of debris and gastric parasites in fish-eating birds|last1= Piersma| first1= T |first2= M.

===Distribution===

Contour feathers are not uniformly distributed on the skin of the bird except in some groups such as the [[penguin]]s, ratites and screamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Study of the Pterylosis and Pneumaticity of the Screamer|jstor=1364475|last=Demay|first=Ida S.|journal=The Condor|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/99003|volume=42|issue=2|year=1940|pages=112–118|doi=10.2307/1364475|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221153848/https://sora.unm.edu/node/99003|archive-date=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most birds the feathers grow from specific tracts of skin called ''pterylae''; between the pterylae there are regions which are free of feathers called ''apterylae'' (or ''apteria'').

A bird's feathers undergo wear and tear and are replaced periodically during the bird's life through [[molt]]ing.

Although sexual selection plays a major role in the development of feathers, in particular the color of the feathers it is not the only conclusion available. New studies are suggesting that the unique feathers of birds is also a large influence on many important aspects of avian behavior, such as the height at which a different species build their nests. Since females are the prime care givers, evolution has helped select females to display duller colored down so that they may blend into the nesting environment. The position of the nest and whether it has a greater chance of being under predation has exerted constraints on female birds' plumage.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = T.

Since the female is the main care giver in some species of birds, evolution has helped select traits that make her feathers dull and often allow her to blend into the surroundings. The height study found that birds that nest in the canopies of trees often have many more predator attacks due to the brighter color of feathers that the female displays.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Another influence of evolution that could play a part in why feathers of birds are so colorful and display so many patterns could be due to that birds developed their bright colors from the vegetation and flowers that thrive around them. Birds develop their bright colors from living around certain colors. Most bird species often blend into their environment, due to some degree of camouflage, so if the species habitat is full of colors and patterns, the species would eventually evolve to blend in to avoid being eaten.  Birds' feathers show a large range of colors, even exceeding the variety of many plants, leaf and flower colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Caswell Stoddard| first1= Mary | last2= Prum| first2= Richard O. |year=2011 |title=How colorful are birds?

==Parasites==
The feather surface is the home for some ectoparasites, notably feather lice ([[Phthiraptera]]) and feather mites. Feather lice typically live on a single host and can move only from parents to chicks, between mating birds, and, occasionally, by [[phoresy]]. This life history has resulted in most of the parasite species being specific to the host and coevolving with the host, making them of interest in phylogenetic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Toon, A. |author2= Hughes, J. |name-list-style=amp|year=2008|title=Are lice good proxies for host history?

[[Feather holes]] are chewing traces of lice (most probably ''[[Brueelia]]'' spp. lice) on the wing and tail feathers. They were described on [[barn swallow]]s, and because of easy countability, many evolutionary, ecological, and behavioral publications use them to quantify the intensity of infestation.

Parasitic cuckoos which grow up in the nests of other species also have host-specific feather lice and these seem to be transmitted only after the young cuckoos leave the host nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Brooke, M. de L.  |author2=Hiroshi Nakamura|year=1998|title=The acquisition of host-specific feather lice by common cuckoos (''Cuculus canorus'')|journal=Journal of Zoology|volume=244|pages=167–173|doi=10.1017/S0952836998002027|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds maintain their feather condition by [[Preening (bird)|preening]] and bathing in water or [[dust bathing|dust]].

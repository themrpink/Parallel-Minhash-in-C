Zeffirelli frequently cast unknown actors in major roles: [[Leonard Whiting]] (Romeo in ''Romeo and Juliet''), [[Graham Faulkner]] (St. Francis in ''[[Brother Sun, Sister Moon]]'') and [[Martin Hewitt (actor)|Martin Hewitt]] (David Axelrod in ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]]'').

===Opera===
Zeffirelli was a major director of opera productions from the 1950s in Italy and elsewhere in Europe as well as the United States. He began his career in the theatre as assistant to Luchino Visconti. Then he tried his hand at scenography. His first work as a director was [[Opera buffa|buffo operas]] by [[Gioachino Rossini]]. He became a friend of [[Maria Callas]] and they worked together on a ''[[La traviata]]'' in [[Dallas]], Texas, in 1958. Of particular note is his 1964 [[Royal Opera House]] production of ''[[Tosca]]'' with Maria Callas and [[Tito Gobbi]]. In the same year, he created Callas' last ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' at the Paris Opera. Zeffirelli also collaborated with &lt;!-- Not a 'Dame' until 1979 --&gt;[[Joan Sutherland]], designing and directing her performances of [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' in 1959. Over the years he created several productions for the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York, including ''[[La bohème]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', ''[[Turandot]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. When the new [[Metropolitan Opera]] opened at Lincoln Center, he directed its first production, [[Samuel Barber]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', starring Leontyne Price.

==Honours==
In 1996, he was awarded an honorary degree for services to the arts by the [[University of Kent]] at a graduation ceremony held in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. In 1999, he received the [[Crystal Globe]] award for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]].
In November 2004, he was awarded an [[British honours system|honorary knighthood]] by the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4037897.stm &quot;UK honour for director Zeffirelli&quot;], BBC News. Accessed 27 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Zeffirelli received criticism from religious groups for what they call the [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] representation of biblical figures in his films.&lt;ref name=&quot;glbtq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Patricia Julian|title=Zeffirelli, Franco|publisher=glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Culture|date=9 January 2005|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/zeffirelli_f.html|accessdate=7 August 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814115944/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/zeffirelli_f.html|archive-date=14 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrariwise, Zeffirelli roused accusations of [[antisemitism]] for describing [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' as a product of &quot;that Jewish cultural scum of Los Angeles which is always spoiling for a chance to attack the Christian world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulaby2019&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/06/15/514094174/franco-zeffirelli-creator-of-lavish-productions-on-screen-and-stage-dies-at-96|title=Franco Zeffirelli, Creator Of Lavish Productions On Screen And Stage, Dies At 96|work=[[Weekend Edition]], [[NPR]]|date=15 June 2019|accessdate=15 June 2019|last=Ulaby|first=Neda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeffirelli was a highly conservative Roman Catholic,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulaby2019&quot;/&gt; and served two terms in the [[Italian senate]] as a member of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s centre-right [[Forza Italia]] party.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Franco Zeffirelli|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24855930|work=BBC News|date=15 June 2019|accessdate=15 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was criticized by members of the gay community for upholding the [[Catholic Church]]'s position on [[homosexuality]]&lt;ref name=&quot;glbtq&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulaby2019&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCobit&quot;/&gt; and by others for support of [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|the Church's position on abortion]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulaby2019&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCobit&quot;/&gt; which extended to calling for [[capital punishment]] for women who had terminated a pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCobit&quot;/&gt;

He roused controversy again when he told a newspaper in 2006 that he had not suffered any harm from [[sexual abuse by priests|sexual abuse by a priest]] as a child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulaby2019&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1996, Zeffirelli [[came out]] as [[gay]], but thereafter preferred to be discreet about his personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/21/books.film|title=Zeffirelli tells all about priest's sexual assault|author=Barbara McMahon|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 November 2006|accessdate=1 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeffirelli said that he considered himself &quot;[[homosexuality|homosexual]]&quot; rather than gay, as he felt the term &quot;gay&quot; was less elegant.&lt;ref name='NYTProfile'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/arts/music/19zeffirelli.html|title=Maestro Still Runs the Show, Grandly|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Rachel Donadio|date=18 August 2009|accessdate=1 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeffirelli adopted two adult sons, men with whom he had lived and who worked for him for years, managing his affairs.&lt;ref name='NYTProfile'/&gt;

==Allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault==
Director [[Bruce Robinson]] claimed to have been the target of [[Sexual harassment|unwanted sexual advances]] by Zeffirelli during the filming of ''Romeo and Juliet'', in which Robinson played [[Benvolio]]. Robinson says that he based the lecherous character of Uncle Monty in the film ''[[Withnail and I]]'' on Zeffirelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Bruce Robinson|url=http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/brucerobinson.html|accessdate=7 August 2007|last=Murphy|first=Peter|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184620/http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/brucerobinson.html|archive-date=7 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, actor [[Johnathon Schaech]] alleged that Zeffirelli [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] him during the filming of ''[[Sparrow (1993 film)|Sparrow]]'' (''Storia di una capinera'', 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Actor Johnathon Schaech: I Was Molested by Director Franco Zeffirelli Zeffirelli directed Schaech in the 1994 film Sparrow|url=http://people.com/movies/johnathon-schaech-molested-franco-zeffirelli/?xid=socialflow_twitter_peoplemag|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=11 January 2018|accessdate=18 June 2019|last=Schaech|first=Johnathon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeffirelli's son Giuseppe &quot;Pippo&quot; issued a statement at the time denying the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/01/11/director-franco-zeffirelli-94-accused-molesting-actor-1992-son-denies/1025870001/|title=Director Franco Zeffirelli, 94, accused of molesting actor in 1992; son denies it|work=[[Associated Press|AP]]/[[USA Today]]|date=11 January 2018|accessdate=18 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/franco-zeffirelli-abuse-accusers-speak-1219298|title=The Dark Side of Franco Zeffirelli: Abuse Accusers Speak Out Upon the Famed Director's Death|work=[[HollywoodReporter.com]]|author=Rebecca Keegan|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=1 December 2019}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merced''' {{IPAc-en|m|ɜːr|ˈ|s|ɛ|d}} ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Mercy&quot;) is a city in, and the [[county seat]] of, [[Merced County, California|Merced County]], [[California]], [[United States]], in the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. As of 2019, the city had a population of 83,676.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCensusEst2019&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2019.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporated on April 1, 1889, Merced is a [[charter city]] that operates under a [[Council-Manager government|council-manager government]]. It is named after the [[Merced River]], which flows nearby.

Merced, known as the &quot;Gateway to [[Yosemite Valley|Yosemite]],&quot; is less than two hours by automobile from [[Yosemite National Park]] to the east and [[Monterey Bay]], the Pacific Ocean, and multiple beaches to the west. The community is served by the passenger rail service [[Merced (Amtrak station)|Amtrak]], a minor, heavily subsidized airline through [[Merced Regional Airport]], and three bus lines. It is approximately {{convert|110|mi|km}} from [[Sacramento]], {{convert|130|mi|km}} from [[San Francisco]], {{convert|45|mi|km}} from [[Fresno]], and {{convert|270|mi|km}} from [[Los Angeles]].

In 2005, the city became home to the 10th [[University of California]] campus, [[University of California, Merced]] (UC Merced), the first research university built in the U.S. in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucmerced.edu/about_ucmerced/mission.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523060140/http://www.ucmerced.edu/about_ucmerced/mission.asp|url-status=dead|title=UC Merced – Mission Statement|archive-date=May 23, 2007|accessdate=February 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, Merced has been home to University of California, Merced. Current recreational opportunities in the city include [[:Commons:Category:Merced, CA, Applegate Park|Applegate Park]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070103195238/http://www.cityofmerced.org/depts/parks_n_community_services/cs/applegate/default.asp zoo], Bear and Black Rascal Creeks and their bike trails, a skate park located in Applegate, [http://www.playhousemerced.com/ Playhouse Merced], a live-stage theater [[:Commons:Category:Merced, CA, Downtown|downtown]], two first-run movie theaters, [[The Mainzer]] Theater which is known for its historic and architectural value, the [[:Commons:Category:Merced, CA, Historic Courthouse|County Courthouse Museum]] circa 1889, the [http://www.artsmerced.org/ Merced Multicultural Arts Center] and the [[:Commons:Category:Merced, CA, County Library|County Library]]. Though still growing, Merced has several shopping areas including the [http://www.mercedmall.com/ Merced Mall], anchored by [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[JCPenney]] and [[Kohl's]], a strip mall located on the city's northwest side which includes, [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[Lowe's]], [[Walmart]], and several restaurants. Merced's Main Street contains several restaurants, a movie theater, and other assorted shops.

Also within a short distance from the city limits are the [[Castle Air Museum]], [[Lake Yosemite]], and Merced Falls. The city of Merced along with its surrounding cities are serviced by the ''[[Merced Sun-Star]]'' and the ''[[Merced County Times]]''. The ''Sun-Star'' daily newspaper has a circulation of over 20,000 in the Merced area and the ''Times'' weekly newspaper has a circulation of over 5,000.

Homes at the median level in Merced had lost 62% of their value from the second quarter of 2006, when they peaked at $336,743, the biggest drop anywhere in the country, according to data provided to Forbes by Local Market Monitor, a Cary, North-Carolina-based real-estate research firm. Home prices have since rebounded, with the median sale price in April 2018 at $247,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realtor.com/local/Merced_CA |title=Merced, CA Housing Market |publisher= Realtor.com |date=April 17, 2018 |accessdate= May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, home building and buying grew exponentially in Merced, but the metro area went to a 14.2% unemployment rate in December 2013. Having since recovered to a rate of 8.7% in April 2018, it is still above the national and state unemployment averages. However, some efforts have been directed towards diversifying its economy and are showing a lowering trend in the overall unemployment rate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.ca_merced_msa.htm |title=Merced, CA Economy at a Glance |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=April 15, 2018 |accessdate= May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].

During the [[Great Recession]] Merced suffered one of the greatest property price collapses in the country and house prices at the end of 2009 had fallen to 1998 levels, according to [[Zillow]], making housing affordable compared to many other California locations. Merced's population has grown faster than the state average since 1980. Over the past nine years, the annualized growth rate is about 3.4%. This rapid expansion of population has stimulated significant retail growth since 1992. Several major retail chain stores have entered Merced, adding over {{convert|750000|sqft|m2}} of new retail space in that time and increasing the City's sales tax receipts by over $500,000 annually.

The economy has traditionally relied upon [[agribusiness]] and upon the presence of [[Castle Air Force Base]]. Over the past twenty years, more diversified industry has entered the area, including printing, fiberglass boat building, warehousing and distribution, and packaging industries.

In September 1995, [[Castle Air Force Base]] closed after phasing down over the previous three years. This affected residential real estate and some sectors of the retail and service economies but overall retail continued to increase. No significant increase in unemployment was  noted. Re-use of the former base is actively proceeding. Industrial development is increasing in the area.

Since 1992, more than {{convert|400000|sqft|m2}} of new industrial activity has started. In May 1995, Merced was selected as the home of the next University of California campus. UC Merced opened with its first 1,000 students in September 2005. Local planning is underway to accommodate campus development, which will eventually accommodate about 25,000 students.

==History==
The first Merced post office opened in 1870.&lt;ref name=CGN&gt;{{California's Geographic Names|801}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Merced incorporated in 1889&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt; and now operates under the Council-Manager form of government.

During [[World War II]], the Merced County fairgrounds were the site of a temporary &quot;[[Internment of Japanese Americans#WCCA Civilian Assembly Centers|assembly center]]&quot; where Japanese Americans were detained after being [[Internment of Japanese Americans|removed]] from their West Coast homes under [[Executive Order 9066]]. 4,669 men, women and children from central [[California]] (with most coming from Merced County) were confined in the Merced Assembly Center from May 6 to September 15, 1942, when they were transferred to the more permanent [[Granada War Relocation Center|Granada]] internment camp in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Iwata, Adrienne.

==== High-speed rail ====
Officials of the [[California High-Speed Rail]] Authority say a flat, straight stretch through the [[San Joaquin Valley]] connecting Merced and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] will likely be the first completed. Regional Manager Thomas Tracy told the [[Visalia, California|Visalia]] City Council that the {{convert|800|mi|km|adj=on}} project will be built in eight phases. The first segment, due by 2015, would stretch from Bakersfield to Merced on an initial run from [[San Diego]] to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. At its full 220&amp;nbsp;mph speed, the normally three-hour car trip from Merced to Bakersfield would take 45 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Sample trips in the California High Speed rail would include:

* Merced to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] – 43 minutes
* Merced to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] – 45 minutes
* Merced to [[San Francisco]] – 1 hour and 15 minutes
* Merced to [[Los Angeles]] – 1 hour and 40 minutes

Martens, Hydrogeology Journal, Issue	Volume 14, Numbers 1–2, January, 2006, Springer Berlin /Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, drilling of new water wells was severely restricted.&lt;ref&gt;''Environmental Site Assessment for proposed development, Merced, California'', Earth Metrics Inc, October 17, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Merced has a [[semi-arid climate]], featuring very hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=18427&amp;cityname=Merced,+California,+United+States+of+America&amp;units=|title=Merced, California Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|accessdate=February 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Average January temperatures are a maximum of 55.0&amp;nbsp;°F and a minimum of 36.0&amp;nbsp;°F.  Average July temperatures are a maximum of 97.1&amp;nbsp;°F and a minimum of 60.9&amp;nbsp;°F.  There are an average of 98.7 days with highs of 90&amp;nbsp;°F (32&amp;nbsp;°C) or higher and an average of 33.6 days with lows of 32&amp;nbsp;°F (0&amp;nbsp;°C) or lower.  The record highest temperature of 114&amp;nbsp;°F was recorded on July 24, 1902, and August 8, 1905.  The record lowest temperature of 13&amp;nbsp;°F was recorded on January 13, 2007.

Most of the rainfall occurs during the winter and averages {{convert|12.21|in|mm}} annually.  There are an average of 48 days annually with measurable precipitation.  The wettest year was 1998 with {{convert|21.66|in|mm}} and the driest year was 1947 with {{convert|5.50|in|mm}}.  The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|8.00|in|mm}} in January 1909.

Although snow is relatively rare in Merced, averaging only {{convert|0.6|in|mm|adj=on}} annually, the city's proximity to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] has resulted in some instances of remarkably heavy snowfall.  The record 24-hour snowfall was {{convert|13.9|in|cm}} on February 16, 1946.  The most snowfall in one month was {{convert|39.0|in|cm}} in December 1906.&lt;ref name=WRCC /&gt;

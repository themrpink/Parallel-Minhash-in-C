Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]]. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name &quot;Queen&quot;. Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their [[Queen (Queen album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, ''[[Queen II]]'', in 1974. ''[[Sheer Heart Attack]]'' later that year and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured &quot;[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]&quot;, which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the [[music video]] format.

The band's 1977 album ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' contained &quot;[[We Will Rock You]]&quot; and &quot;[[We Are the Champions]]&quot;, which have become [[anthem]]s at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] bands in the world. &quot;[[Another One Bites the Dust]]&quot; from ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'' (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album in the UK]] and is certified eight times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], England. In 1991, he died of [[Pneumonia|bronchopneumonia]]—a complication of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]—and Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured under the &quot;Queen +&quot; name with vocalists [[Paul Rodgers]] and [[Adam Lambert]].

Estimates of Queen's record sales range from 170&amp;nbsp;million to 300&amp;nbsp;million records, making them one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. In 1990, Queen received the [[Brit Award]] for [[Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music|Outstanding Contribution to British Music]] from the [[British Phonographic Industry]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001. Each member has composed hit singles, and all four were inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2003. In 2005, Queen received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]]. In 2018, they were presented the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

==History==

===1968–1971: Foundations===
[[File:Queen First Public Performance Here 18 July 1970.jpg|thumb|upright|[[PRS for Music]] heritage award commemorating Queen's first performance, [[Prince Consort Road]], London]]
The founder members of Queen met in West London during the late 1960s. Guitarist [[Brian May]] had built his own guitar with his father in 1963, and formed the group 1984 the following year with singer [[Tim Staffell]].{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=30,32-33}} May left the group in early 1968 to focus on his degree in Physics and Infa-Red Astronomy at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] and find a group that could write original material.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=37,44,64}} He formed the group [[Smile (band)|Smile]] with Staffell (now playing bass) and with keyboardist Chris Smith.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=59}} To complete the line-up, May placed an advertisement on a college notice board for a &quot;[[Mitch Mitchell]]/[[Ginger Baker]] type&quot; drummer; [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], a young dental student, auditioned and got the job.{{sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=118}} Smith left the group in early 1969, immediately before a gig at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] with [[Free (band)|Free]] and the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]].{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=62}}

While attending [[Ealing Art College]] in west London, Staffell became friends with fellow student [[Freddie Mercury|Freddie Bulsara]], who was from [[Zanzibar]] and of Indian [[Parsi]] descent.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=44}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Freddie Mercury's complex relationship with Zanzibar |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/world-africa-45900712 |access-date=28 February 2019 |agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulsara had studied fashion design for a year before switching to graphic art and design,{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=56-57}} and soon became a keen fan of Smile. He asked if he could join the group as lead singer, but May felt Staffell would not give up that role.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=65}} He also ran a stall in [[Kensington Market, London|Kensington Market]] with Taylor.{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=7}}

In 1970, Staffell quit Smile, feeling his interests in Soul and R&amp;B clashed with the group's hard rock sound and being fed up with the lack of success. He formed the group [[Humpy Bong]] with former [[Bee Gees]] drummer [[Colin Petersen]].{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=92-93}} The remaining members accepted Bulsara as lead singer, and recruited Taylor's friend Mike Grose as bassist. The four played their first gig at a fundraising event in [[Truro]] on 27 June 1970.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=95}} Bulsara suggested the group should be renamed to &quot;Queen&quot;. The others were uncertain at first, but he said &quot;it's wonderful, dear, people will love it&quot;.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=95}} At the same time, he decided to change his surname to &quot;Mercury&quot;, inspired by the line &quot;Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me&quot; in the song &quot;[[Queen (Queen album)#&quot;My Fairy King&quot;|My Fairy King]]&quot;.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=96}} The group played their first London gig on 18 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21669973 |title=Heritage award to mark Queen's first gig |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early set consisted of material that would later appear on the first two albums, along with various rock and roll covers, such as [[Cliff Richard]] and [[the Shadows]]' &quot;[[Please Don't Tease]]&quot;. They attracted the attention of producer [[John Anthony (record producer)|John Anthony]], who was interested in the group's sound but thought they had the wrong bass player.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=96}} Grose decided not to continue with the band and was replaced by Barry Mitchell.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=97}} In turn, Mitchell left in January 1971 and was replaced by Doug Bogie for two gigs.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=102,105}}

===1971–1974: ''Queen'' and ''Queen II''===
In February 1971, [[John Deacon]] joined Queen. As well as a good bassist, his quiet demeanour complemented the band, and he was skilled in electronics.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=107}} On 2 July, Queen played their first show with the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey college outside London.{{refn|1={{harvp|Sutcliffe|2009|p=26}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutcliffe-2009&quot;/&gt;}} May called Terry Yeadon, an engineer at Pye Studios where Smile had recorded, to see if he knew anywhere where Queen could go. Yeadon had since moved to [[De Lane Lea Studios]]' new premises in [[Wembley]], and they needed a group to test out the equipment and recording rooms. He tried asking [[The Kinks]] but couldn't get hold of them. Therefore, he told Queen they could record some demos in exchange for the studio's acoustic tests.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=112-113}} They recorded five of their own songs, &quot;[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]&quot;, &quot;[[Keep Yourself Alive]]&quot;, &quot;[[Queen (Queen album)#&quot;Great King Rat&quot;|Great King Rat]]&quot;, &quot;[[Queen (Queen album)#&quot;The Night Comes Down&quot;|The Night Comes Down]]&quot; and &quot;[[Queen (Queen album)#&quot;Jesus&quot;|Jesus]]&quot;. During the recording, John Anthony visited the band with [[Roy Thomas Baker]]. The latter thought &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; would be a hit and started trying to interest record companies.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=114}}

[[File:The Cavern Club, exhibited signed guitars for memorable performances - The Rolling Stones (5th November 1963) - Crescent Stratocaster, Queen (31st October 1970) - Squier Stratocaster (2016-09-04 20.44.17 by NH53).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Queen guitar (right, next to a Rolling Stones guitar) at the [[The Cavern Club|Cavern Club]] in Liverpool, marking a 31 October 1970 Queen concert at the venue]]
Promoter Ken Testi managed to interest [[Charisma Records]] who offered Queen an advance of around £25,000, but the group turned them down as they realised the label would promote [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] as a priorty. Testi then entered discussions with [[Trident Studios]]' [[Norman Sheffield]], who offered the band a management deal under Neptune Productions, a subsidiary of Trident, to manage the band and enable them to use their facilities, whilst the management searched for a deal. This suited both parties, as Trident were expanding into management, and under the deal, Queen were able to make use of the hi-tech recording facilities used by signed musicians.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=117-118}} Taylor later described these early off-peak studio hours as &quot;gold dust&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06s76l4|title=Queen: From Rags to Rhapsody – BBC Four|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen began 1972 with a gig at [[Bedford College, London]] where only six people turned up. After a few more shows, they stopped live performances for eight months to work on the album with Anthony and Baker.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=117-118}} They could only record in Trident during down-time, when nobody else was using the studio, which was usually between 3am and 7am. During the sessions, they saw [[David Bowie]] with the [[Spiders From Mars]] live and realised they needed to make an impact with the album, otherwise they would be left behind.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=119-120}} The album was a mix of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[progressive rock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=Peter|year=2003|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|page=422|publisher=Rough Guides}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group were unhappy with the re-recording of &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot;, so the finished album uses the De Lane Lea demo. Another track, &quot;[[Headlong (song)#B-sides|Mad The Swine]]&quot; was dropped from the running order after the band and Baker could not agree on a mix.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=121}} [[Mike Stone (record producer)|Mike Stone]] created the final mix for &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, and he would go on to work on several other Queen albums.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=122}} In order to attract record company interest, Trident booked a &quot;showcase&quot; gig on 6 November at [[The Pheasantry]], followed by a show at the [[Marquee Club]] on 20 December.{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=17}}

Queen promoted the unreleased album in February 1973 on [[BBC Radio 1]], still unsigned. The following month, Trident managed to strike a deal with [[EMI Records]]. &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; was released as a single on 6 July, with the album ''[[Queen (Queen album)|Queen]]'' appearing a week later. The front cover showed a shot of Mercury live on stage taken by Taylor's friend Douglass Puddifoot. Deacon was credited as &quot;Deacon John&quot; while Taylor used his full name, Roger Meddows-Taylor.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=126-127}} The album was received well by critics; Gordon Fletcher of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it &quot;superb&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/queen-19731206|title=Queen By Gordon Fletcher December 6, 1973|date=December 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chicago's ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' called it an &quot;above-average debut&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=''Queen''|date=7 December 1973|periodical=Daily Herald | location = Chicago, IL|url=http://queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_12-07-1973_-_Queen_-_The_Herald%2C_Chicago%2C_IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it drew little mainstream attention, and &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; sold poorly. Retrospectively, it is cited as the album's highlight, and in 2008 ''Rolling Stone'' ranked it 31st in the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;, describing it as &quot;an entire album's worth of riffs crammed into a single song&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rstone.html|title=100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was certified gold in the UK and the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhsa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAAC&quot; /&gt;

The group began to record their second album, ''[[Queen II]]'' in August 1973. Now able to use regular studio time, they decided to make full use of the facilities available. May created a multi-layer guitar introduction &quot;Procession&quot;, while Mercury wrote &quot;The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke&quot; based on [[The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke|the painting of the same name]] by [[Richard Dadd]].{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=131-132}} The group spent the remainder of the year touring the UK, supporting [[Mott The Hoople]], and began to attract an audience.{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=19}} The tour ended with two shows at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] on 14 December, playing to 7,000 people.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=136-137}}

In January 1974, Queen played the [[Sunbury Pop Festival]] in Australia, where they were jeered and taunted by the audience. Before leaving, Mercury announced, &quot;when we come back to Australia, Queen will be the biggest band in the world!&quot;{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=138-139}}{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=21}} ''Queen II'' was released in March, and features [[Mick Rock]]'s iconic [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]]-inspired image of the band on the cover.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=137,142}} This image would later be used as the basis for &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; music video production.&lt;ref name=&quot;cover&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6613107.stm | title = Photographer lives the Rock dream | last = Pryor | first = Fiona | work = BBC News | date = 10 May 2007 | access-date =25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=&quot;history&quot;}} The album reached number five on the [[UK Album Chart|British album chart]] and became the first Queen album to chart in the UK.

===1974–1976: ''Sheer Heart Attack'' to ''A Night at the Opera''===

In May 1974, a month into the band's first US tour opening for Mott the Hoople, May collapsed and was diagnosed with hepatitis, forcing the cancellation of their remaining dates.{{sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=127}} While recuperating, May was initially absent when the band started work on their third album, but he returned midway through the recording process.{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=20}} Released in 1974, ''[[Sheer Heart Attack]]'' reached number two in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/Sheer%20Heart%20Attack |title=Queen – Sheer Heart Attack |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; sold well throughout Europe, and went gold in the US.&lt;ref name=RIAAC/&gt; It gave the band their first real experience of international success, and was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queen Discography|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/queen/|quote= ... and in November released Sheer Heart Attack which was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic.|publisher=Queen Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album experimented with a variety of musical genres, including [[music hall|British music hall]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], ballads, ragtime, and [[List of Caribbean music genres|Caribbean]]. May's &quot;[[Now I'm Here]]&quot; documented the group's curtailed American tour, and &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; served as a vehicle for his regular on-stage solo guitar spot. Deacon wrote his first song for the group, &quot;Misfire&quot;, while the live favourite &quot;[[Stone Cold Crazy]]&quot; was credited to the whole band. Mercury wrote the closing number, &quot;In the Lap of the Gods&quot;, with the intention that the audience could sing along to the chorus when played live. This would be repeated later on, more successfully, in songs such as &quot;We Are the Champions.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=155}}

The single &quot;[[Killer Queen]]&quot; was written by Mercury about a high-class prostitute.{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=22}} It reached number two on the British charts,&lt;ref name=&quot;bhsa&quot;/&gt; and became their first US hit, reaching number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbtfh&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|author-link=Joel Whitburn|year=2006|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits|publisher=Billboard Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was partly recorded at [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Popoff |first1=Martin |title=Queen: Album by Album |date=2018 |publisher=Voyageur Press |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Mercury playing the grand piano, it combines camp, [[vaudeville]], and British music hall with May's guitar. &quot;Now I'm Here&quot; was released as the second single, reached number eleven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|ref=none|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/xxhj|title= Queen: ''Sheer Heart Attack'' Review|author=Jones, Chris|date= 7 June 2007|publisher=BBC|access-date=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' ranked ''Sheer Heart Attack'' number 28 in &quot;The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/classicrock2.htm |title=Classic Rock 'The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever' |publisher=rocklistmusic |access-date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007, ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' ranked it No.88 in &quot;The 100 Records That Changed the World&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', June 2007, &quot;The 100 Records That Changed the World&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the second of three Queen albums to feature in the book ''1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die''.&lt;ref name=&quot;1001albums&quot;/&gt;

In January 1975, Queen left for a world tour with an upgraded light show. They toured the US as headliners, and played in Canada for the first time.{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=25}} Several dates were cancelled after Mercury contacted [[laryngitis]].{{sfn|Dean|1986|pp=24-27}} The band then toured Japan from mid-April to the beginning of May. They were greeted by thousands of screaming fans, and played eight times in seven cities.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=163}}{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=27}} Despite the success, Queen were still tied to the original Trident deal and wages. They were all living in relative poverty in bedsits, while Deacon was refused money for a deposit on a house. EMI contacted lawyer [[Jim Beach]], who tried to find a way of extracting them from their contract. Trident complained that they had invested £200,000 in Queen and wanted their money back first.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=160,165}}

In August, after an acrimonous split with Trident, the band negotiated themselves out of their contract and searched for new management.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=166}} One of the options they considered was an offer from [[Led Zeppelin]]'s manager, [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], who wanted them to sign with Led Zeppelin's own production company, [[Swan Song Records]]. The band were concerned about being a lower priority than Zeppelin and [[Bad Company]] (also signed to Swan Song) and instead contacted [[Elton John]]'s manager, [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], who accepted the position.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=166}}{{sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=166}}

Reid's first instruction to the band was &quot;I'll take care of the business; you make the best record you can&quot;.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=168}} Queen started work on their fourth album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'', taking its name from the popular [[Marx Brothers]] movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced, costing £40,000 and using three different studios.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=177}} Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. Mercury wrote the opening song &quot;Death on Two Legs&quot;, a savage dig at perceived wrongdoers (and later dedicated to Trident in concert){{sfn|Blake|2010|p=178}}{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=25}} and the camp vaudeville &quot;Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot;.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=178}} May's &quot;[[The Prophet's Song]]&quot; was an eight-minute epic; the middle section is a [[canon (music)|canon]], with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound.

The most prominent song on the album, &quot;[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]&quot;, originated from pieces of music that Mercury had written at Ealing College. Mercury played a run-through of the track on piano in his flat to Baker, stopping suddenly to announce, &quot;This is where the opera section comes in&quot;.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=170}} When the rest of the band started recording the song they were unsure as to how it would be pieced together.

===1980–1984: ''The Game'' to ''The Works''===
[[File:Queen Concert Oakland 2.jpg|thumb|right|Queen on stage at the [[Oakland Arena]], Oakland, California, July 1980]]
Queen began their 1980s career with ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]''. It featured the singles &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;[[Another One Bites the Dust]]&quot;, both of which reached number one in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbtfh&quot;/&gt; After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles, [[Michael Jackson]] suggested to Mercury backstage that &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; be released as a single, and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one.{{refn|1={{harvp|Sutcliffe|2009|p=155}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutcliffe-2009&quot;/&gt;}} The album topped the ''Billboard'' 200 for five weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=The Billboard Albums|place=[[Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin]]|publisher=Record Research|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold over four million copies in the US.&lt;ref name=RIAAC/&gt; It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album. Heretofore, their albums featured a distinctive &quot;No Synthesisers!&quot; sleeve note. The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth, pro-&quot;hard&quot;-rock stance by the band,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/queen.html|title=Inductees – The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation|publisher=Vocalgroup.org|access-date=2 June 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130034307/http://vocalgroup.org/inductees/queen.html|archive-date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later revealed by producer [[Roy Thomas Baker]] to be an attempt to clarify that those albums' multi-layered solos were created with guitars, not synths, as record company executives kept assuming at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;sos1995&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Cunningham|first=Mark|title=AN INVITATION TO THE OPERA: Roy Thomas Baker &amp; Gary Langan: The Making Of Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'|magazine=Sound on Sound|date=October 1995|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/oct95/queen.html|quote=There was no stipulation that we wouldn't have any synths, but the statement 'No synths' was printed on the album sleeves because of peoples' lack of intellect in the ears department.

In 1982, the band released the album ''[[Hot Space]]'', a departure from their trademark seventies sound, this time being a mixture of rock, [[pop rock]], dance, [[funk]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/queen-hot-space.htm |title=Queen – Hot Space |magazine=Stylusmagazine.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the album was recorded in [[Munich]] during the most turbulent period in the band's history, and Taylor and May lamented the new sound, with both being very critical of the influence Mercury's personal manager Paul Prenter had on the singer.&lt;ref&gt;O'Casey, Matt, dir.

After fans noticed Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988, the media reported that Mercury was seriously ill, with [[AIDS]] frequently mentioned as a likely illness. Mercury denied this, insisting he was merely &quot;exhausted&quot; and too busy to provide interviews; he was now 42 years old and had been involved in music for nearly two decades.&lt;ref&gt;''VH1 Legends: Queen''-Viacom International, VH1, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury had in fact been diagnosed as HIV positive in 1987, but did not make his illness public, with only his inner circle of colleagues and friends aware of his condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrianQuoteFreddie&quot;/&gt;

The band continued recording albums, starting with ''The Miracle'' (1989) and continuing with ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]'' (1991). In 1990, Queen ended their contract with Capitol and signed with [[Hollywood Records]]; through the deal, [[Disney Music Group|Disney]] acquired the North American distribution rights to Queen's catalogue for $10&amp;nbsp;million, and remains the group's music catalogue owner and distributor in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Queen Signs With Disney, Raising Hope For CD Releases|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-09-13/features/9003160958_1_queen-catalog-reissues-international-cd-exchange|access-date=17 July 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Los Angeles Daily News|date=13 September 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilker|first1=Deborah|title=Queen Must Decide On Replacing Freddie Mercury|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-05-07/features/9202100472_1_roxy-meade-queen-freddie-mercury|access-date=17 July 2014|work=Sun-Sentinel|date=7 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February that year, Mercury made his final public appearance when he joined the rest of Queen onstage at the [[Dominion Theatre]], London to collect the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/events/brit_awards/freddy.htm|title=The Highs and Lows of the Brit Awards|publisher=BBC|access-date=28 September 2014|date=2 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Innuendo'' was released in early 1991 with an [[Innuendo (song)|eponymous number 1 UK hit]] and other charting singles released later in the year, which included &quot;[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]&quot;.

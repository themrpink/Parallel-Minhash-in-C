The Sorting Hat claims that [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)|blood purity]] is a factor in selecting Slytherins, although this is not mentioned until the fifth book. There is no reason to believe, however, that Muggle-born students are not sorted there, merely that pure-blooded students are more desirable to that house, as there are several examples of half-bloods in the house - such as Snape, Tom Riddle/Voldemort and Harry himself was only excluded from the house at his own insistence. In ''Deathly Hallows'', a group of Snatchers claim that &quot;not many Mudbloods&quot; are sorted into Slytherin.

When believing Harry to be dead and thinking that he has final victory in his grasp, Voldemort proclaims his intention to abolish the other three houses and force all Hogwarts students into Slytherin. This design is foiled by his defeat and death, after which Slytherin becomes more diluted in its blood purity, no longer remaining the pure-blood bastion it once was.

==Subjects and teachers==
{{Main|Subjects at Hogwarts|Hogwarts staff}}
Being a school of magic, many subjects at Hogwarts differ from the studies of a typical school. Some subjects, such as [[Magic in Harry Potter#History of Magic|History of Magic]], derive from non-wizard&amp;nbsp;– or muggle&amp;nbsp;– subjects, but many others, such as [[Magic in Harry Potter#Charms|charms]] and [[Subjects at Hogwarts#Appartition|apparition]] classes, are unique to the wizarding world.
There are twelve named teachers (referred to as Professors), each specialising in a single subject. All professors are overseen by a school head and deputy head. [[Transfiguration (Harry Potter)|Transfiguration]], [[Subjects at Hogwarts#Defence Against the Darks Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Magic in Harry Potter#Charms|Charms]], [[Potions Class|Potions]], [[Magic in Harry Potter#Astronomy|Astronomy]], [[Magic in Harry Potter#History of Magic|History of Magic]], and [[Magic in Harry Potter#Herbology|Herbology]] are compulsory subjects for the first five years, as well as [[Magic in Harry Potter#Flying|flying lessons]]. At the end of their second year, students are required to add at least two optional subjects to their syllabus for the start of the third year. The five choices are [[Magic in Harry Potter#Arithmancy|Arithmancy]], [[Muggle Studies]], [[Magic in Harry Potter#Divination|Divination]], [[Magic in Harry Potter#Study of Ancient Runes|Study of Ancient Runes]] and [[Care of Magical Creatures]]. According to J.K. Rowling, &quot;very specialised subjects such as [[Magic in Harry Potter#Alchemy|alchemy]] are sometimes offered in the final two years, if there is sufficient demand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|title=Hogwarts School Subjects|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hogwarts-school-subjects|work=[[Pottermore]]|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of their fifth year, students take the Ordinary Wizarding Level (O.W.L.) examinations for all subjects in which they are enrolled. Each examination consists of a written knowledge test and, where applicable, a practical demonstration of skills before a panel of proctors from the Ministry of Magic. Students who achieve a high enough O.W.L. grade in a particular subject may take its advanced course for the final two years, in preparation for the Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests (N.E.W.T.) given at the end of the seventh year.

==Student life==
[[File:The Great Hall, Hogwarts.jpg|thumb|right|Film set of The Great Hall, Hogwarts at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]], UK]]
The day begins at Hogwarts with breakfast in the Great Hall. Students sit at their own House table and can eat and socialise, or finish homework. The Headmaster or Headmistress eats with the professors at the High Table placed at the far end of the hall. During breakfast, owls bring in the students' post, generally consisting of ''[[The Daily Prophet]]'', letters from parents or friends, or packages from home. A bell signals the start of the first class of the morning at 9&amp;nbsp;am.

There are two long morning classes with a short break in between them for students to get to their next class. After lunch, classes resume at 1&amp;nbsp;pm, and there is a break around afternoon teatime before another class period. The classes are about one hour in length, with occasional double periods lasting two hours. Classes end around five o'clock. First-year students get Friday afternoons off, while sixth- and seventh-year students have several free periods during the week. In the evening, students eat their dinner in the Great Hall, after which they are expected to be in their common rooms. Astronomy classes take place late at night in the Astronomy Tower.

[[File:The Great Hall, Hogwarts 2.jpg|thumb|The Great Hall film set at Leavesden studios.]]

The four House dormitories have secret entrances, generally known only to members of that house and require a password (Gryffindor &amp; Slytherin), riddle answer (Ravenclaw) or ritual (Hufflepuff) in order to gain entrance. Inside is the common room, which contains armchairs and sofas for the pupils and tables for studying and homework. There are fireplaces to keep the rooms warm, and students either relax here in the evenings or else complete their homework, but may complete their work in the bedroom. There are notice boards in each common room and at other strategic points throughout the school. The students sleep in their House dormitories, which branch off from the common rooms. Each dormitory gets at least two rooms; one for boys and one for girls (an enchantment prevents boys from entering the girls' area, although there is no spell to prevent the reverse from occurring). Each student sleeps in a large four-poster bed with bed covers and heavy curtains in the House colours, and thick white pillows. There is a bedside table for each bed, and each dormitory has a jug of water and goblets on a tray.

On designated weekends, Hogwarts students in their third year or higher, with a signed [[permission slip]], are permitted to walk to the nearby wizarding village of Hogsmeade, where they can relax and enjoy the pubs, restaurants and shops. There appears to be a good relationship between the school and the village, and the students get on well with the locals. Favourite places in Hogsmeade include [[Honeydukes|Honeydukes Sweetshop]], [[Zonko's|Zonko's Joke Shop]], clothing stores such as [[Places in Harry Potter#Gladrags Wizardwear|Gladrags Wizardwear]], the [[Shrieking Shack]] (regarded as the most haunted building in Britain), the pubs [[The Three Broomsticks]] and [[The Hog's Head]], and [[Madam Puddifoot's|Madam Puddifoot's coffee shop]].

===Food===
The [[House-elf|house-elves]] at Hogwarts amongst other duties provide all food to students and staff. They cook a wide variety of dishes especially at the feasts. The various dishes are prepared in the kitchens directly below the Great Hall. Within the kitchen are four long tables directly aligned with the house tables in the great hall above. At meal times the food is magically transported up, appearing directly in front of the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|last=Rowling, J. K.|date=2000|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=0-7475-4624-X|location=London|pages=Chapter 21|nopp=y|oclc=44614312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discipline===
Apart from losing points from a house, serious misdeeds at Hogwarts are punishable by detention. Whenever a student loses a house point, their house jewels ([[ruby]] for Gryffindors, [[Emerald|emeralds]] for Slytherin, [[Sapphire|sapphires]] for Ravenclaw, and topazes for Hufflepuff) are taken away from a glass hourglass located in every classroom. The same goes for adding points to the specific house, although the teacher or prefect must conjure the gems from thin air.

According to the school caretaker, [[Argus Filch]], detention meant subjection to various forms of [[corporal punishment]] until recently. [[Arthur Weasley]] claimed still to bear physical scars inflicted by Apollyon Pringle, Filch's predecessor. In present times, however, detention usually involves assisting staff or faculty with tedious tasks. Examples of detention include the one imposed on Harry by Umbridge in ''Order of the Phoenix''. In this case, Harry was forced to write, &quot;I must not tell lies&quot; repeatedly using a magical quill which then carves what is written into the back of the writer's hand. However, most teachers at the school never use this cruel punishment. In another case, when Snape caught Harry using the Sectumsempra curse on Draco, he was forced to go through over a thousand boxes of files describing wrongdoers at Hogwarts and their punishments. Harry was supposed to order them in alphabetical order, and rewrite the cards whose words were hard to see or otherwise damaged. The Weasley twins Fred and George had a whole drawer of these cards.

For even more serious offences, students may be suspended or even expelled from Hogwarts. Harry and Ron are threatened with expulsion after crashing Ron's car into the Whomping Willow at the start of their second year, and Harry is expelled before the start of his fifth year (although the sentence is quickly changed to a disciplinary hearing) after he is detected using magic in the presence of Muggles, a serious offence among the wizarding community. Dumbledore argued in Harry's defence, stating that it was done in self-defence, and that the Ministry has no authority to expel students&amp;nbsp;– such powers are invested in the Headmaster and the Board of Governors. Snape has attempted to have Harry expelled, and he attempted to have Harry's father, [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], expelled when they were at Hogwarts together. The only student known to have been expelled is Hagrid, for the murder of [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Moaning Myrtle|Myrtle]] with an [[acromantula]] believed to be the Monster of Slytherin and for opening the Chamber of Secrets&amp;nbsp;– crimes for which Tom Riddle had framed him.

Professors seem to be able to punish students with relative impunity and can hand out detention, even for unsatisfactory grades. Enforcement of rules outside of class mainly falls to the caretaker, with the assistance of the prefects. A student's Head of House usually has the final say in disciplinary matters. However, during Umbridge's tenure at Hogwarts, she quickly obtains the power to have the final say in disciplinary actions, due to an Educational Decree (one of many) passed by Minister for Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]].

In the summer before their fifth year, two fifth year students from each House are picked to be [[School prefect|prefects]], which grants them privileges and responsibilities and disciplinary responsibilities. The leaders of the student body, the Head Boy and Head Girl, are drawn from the seventh year students. Prefects have the authority to give detentions for infractions.

==Grounds==
[[File:Universal-Islands-of-Adventure-Harry-Potter-Castle-9182.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of Hogwarts at Universal Studio's ''[[Islands of Adventure]]'' amusement park]]
Hogwarts castle and its grounds are home to many secret areas as well as well-known and well-used places.

===Hiding place of the Philosopher's Stone===
Accessed by entering a trapdoor in the forbidden corridor on the third floor, and protected by a gauntlet of seven magical challenges set up by the teachers.
*A giant three-headed dog named [[Fluffy (Harry Potter)|Fluffy]] placed specially to guard the trapdoor by Hagrid.
*Devil's Snare, grown by Professor Sprout.
*A room containing dozens of keys, charmed by Flitwick to sprout wings and fly near the ceiling. One of these keys will unlock the door to the next section. However, in the film adaptation, the keys attack the seeker of the Stone.
*A large [[chess]]board with an army of large chessmen, transfigured by McGonagall. To continue to the door on the opposite side, the person in question must beat the chessmen at a game of wizards' chess where the player must risk his life if he loses. Ron and Professor Quirrell are the only wizards to win the game of wizards' chess.
*A room with a large [[Troll (Harry Potter)|troll]] inside. This is Quirrell's challenge. In the book, Quirrell had knocked out his own troll to get to the last room and thus the trio did not have to fight it; in the film, it does not appear, but it appears in the [[PlayStation (console)|PS1]] and [[Game Boy Color]] version of the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|game]].
*A series of potions, brewed by Snape. A logical riddle, not magic, has to be solved. There are two doors, blocked by fire. One potion will allow the person to exit the way he or she arrived, another will allow him or her to continue to the next chamber, two are nettle wine, and the other three are poison. This challenge does not appear in the film, but does in the video game adaptation.
*The [[Mirror of Erised]] can be found in the final chamber, further enchanted by Dumbledore to bestow the [[Sorcerer's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] upon a seeker only hoping to acquire the stone but not use it for selfish means.

===Chamber of Secrets===
{{Redirect|Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Cos65 resize.jpg|thumb|left|The Chamber of Secrets as seen in the second film]]
The Chamber of Secrets, which is deep under the school (most likely under the lake),&lt;ref name=CoS16&gt;''Chamber of Secrets'', Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; was home to an ancient [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Basilisk|Basilisk]], intended to be used to purge the school of [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)#Muggle-born|Muggle-born]] students. [[Salazar Slytherin]], one of the founders of Hogwarts, built the Chamber before he left the school.

The entrance to the Chamber is hidden in [[List of Harry Potter supporting characters#Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]'s bathroom on the second floor. One of the sink taps has a snake scratched into its side; when a command in [[Parseltongue]] is spoken, it opens to reveal the mouth of a dark, slimy chute, wide enough to slide down, that gives onto a stone tunnel. There are many skeletons of small animals littering the floor and even a gigantic skin shed by the Basilisk. The tunnel leads to a solid wall, carved with two entwined serpents with emeralds for eyes.&lt;ref name=CoS16/&gt; At a command in Parseltongue, the wall opens to expose a long, dim corridor, lined with monumental statues of snakes, including two rows of towering stone pillars with more carved serpents that brace the ceiling. A colossal statue of Salazar Slytherin, looking ancient and monkey-like, is at the centre. The Basilisk rested inside the statue and emerged from its mouth when the Heir of Slytherin, Tom Riddle, summoned it.&lt;ref&gt;''Chamber of Secrets'', Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;
In his second year at Hogwarts, Harry uses Parseltongue to open the chamber and destroys the diary containing the embodied memory of a 16-year-old Tom Riddle from his own days at Hogwarts and also slays the basilisk. It is later revealed that the diary was a Horcrux.
In ''Deathly Hallows'', Ron and Hermione enter the Chamber. Ron opens the door (despite not speaking Parseltongue) by imitating sounds he heard Harry use to open Slytherin's locket. They pull a basilisk fang from its skeleton to use to destroy the Horcrux made from Helga Hufflepuff's cup.

When Tom Riddle opened the Chamber, Myrtle was sulking in a stall after being teased by student Olive Hornby. She opened the door, intending to tell him to leave, but died immediately upon meeting the Basilisk's gaze and decided to become a ghost to revenge on Hornby.&lt;ref name=CoS16/&gt; Her bathroom remains operational, but is rarely used by students because of Myrtle's disagreeable presence and her habit of flooding it when she is distraught.

The film's depiction of the Chamber has snake heads in place of the pillars and Slytherin's statue is only his head. Rowling reveals in the book ''Harry Potter Page to Screen; The Complete Filmmaking Journey'' that the Chamber has flooded since its creation under unknown circumstances.

===Passages===
There are usually seven secret passages in and out of the school, and in addition, the series describes the use of twin [[vanishing cabinet]]s to create another. Filch knows of just four of these while the Marauders (Remus Lupin, Peter Pettrigrew, Sirius and James) and the Weasley twins know of all seven, though where some lead is unknown. The Room of Requirement may, on occasion, create an eighth passage out of the school. The only known instance of this occurring is a passage to the [[Hog's Head]] bar that formed before the Battle of Hogwarts. Due to the nature of the Room of Requirement, it is possible that several passages to different locations could be accessed from the Room. The three passages out of Hogwarts that Filch does ''not'' know about are:
*A passage beneath the Whomping Willow, leading to the [[Shrieking Shack]].
*A passage behind a mirror on the fourth floor, which is caved in. It led to Hogsmeade, but it is not known exactly where.
*A passage beneath a one-eyed witch statue by the stairs to the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom, leading to the cellar of [[Honeydukes]]. Speaking aloud the word 'Dissendium' to the witch allows access to this passage; the hump on the statue then opens and reveals the hidden passageway.
A further link between two vanishing cabinets, one in the school and the other in [[Borgin and Burkes]] in [[Knockturn Alley]] presumably worked until ''Chamber of Secrets'' when [[Peeves]] (persuaded by [[Nearly Headless Nick]]) smashed the Hogwarts cabinet. The passage was reopened in ''Half-Blood Prince'' when [[Draco Malfoy]] fixed the cabinet. This passage is not shown on the Marauder's Map as it is not part of the castle itself.

Besides passages in and out of the school, there are also numerous short-cuts that lead from one part of the castle to another. These are often concealed in such fashions as a tapestry which hides a hole in the wall.

===Room of Requirement===
On the seventh floor opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy attempting to train trolls for the ballet, the Room of Requirement appears only when someone is in need of it. To make it appear, one must walk past its hidden entrance three times while concentrating on what is needed. The room will then appear, outfitted with whatever is required. To the Hogwarts [[house-elves]], it is also known as the Come and Go Room.

Dumbledore was first to mention the room, noting that he discovered it at five-thirty in the morning, filled with [[chamber pot]]s when he was trying to find a toilet. However, Dumbledore did not appear to know the Room's secrets. [[Dobby the house elf|Dobby]] later told Harry of the Room in detail and admitted to frequently bringing [[Winky (house-elf)|Winky]] to the room to cure her bouts of Butterbeer-induced drunkenness, finding it full of antidotes and a &quot;nice elf-sized bed.&quot; Filch was said to find cleaning supplies here when he had run out; when Fred and George needed a place to hide, it would appear as a broom cupboard. Trelawney also makes a habit of using it to hide her empty sherry bottles after she is sacked in ''Order of the Phoenix''. It would seem that when one wishes to hide something it produces the same room for everyone: the Room of Hidden Things, which is full of many centuries worth of abandoned objects, such as broken furniture, books, and in one case a dead quintaped (for more information see ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''), which were presumably forgotten by their owners.

Harry learned of the room's abilities from Dobby, finding it the perfect location for his [[Dumbledore's Army]] meetings, during which it would be filled with bookcases full of Defence Against the Dark Arts volumes, many different kinds of Dark Detectors, and a plethora of floor cushions for practising defensive spells. &lt;!--  Mentioned first in GF 23, but first described in OP 18.--&gt; When the D.A. was betrayed, the room was left open, and [[Pansy Parkinson]] was able to retrieve the list of members of the organisation. In ''Half-Blood Prince'' Harry used the Room of Hidden Things to stash his copy of ''Advanced Potion-Making'', describing it as the size of a large cathedral and packed to overflowing with items hidden by Hogwarts inhabitants over the years, such as old potions, clothing, ruined furniture, an old tiara (which happened to be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes), or books which were &quot;no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen.&quot; He later realised that Draco had been using the room in that state to hide and repair the [[Vanishing Cabinet]] to use it to smuggle Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Ironically, while Harry tries many times to get into the Room of Requirement to see what Draco is doing, the only time he succeeds to get into the room (and he is not thinking about Draco), he gains access to the room where Malfoy has been working.

In ''Deathly Hallows'', the students who need a place to hide from the Carrows, two Death Eater professors, use the room. It is also revealed that the Room of Requirement's current version can change while still occupied, though should a completely different version be required (e.g. the Room of Hidden Things instead of DA Headquarters) the room must be empty. The Room can also answer to the desire of the wizard within the room, such as providing Harry with a whistle when he needed one during a Dumbledore's Army meeting, or creating a passage to the Hog's Head (as the room cannot produce food). Later, [[Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem|Ravenclaw's diadem]] is found to be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes and has been hidden in the Room of Hidden Things by Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter the Room, with Harry knowing that he must look for a place to hide things, and find the tiara; but they are ambushed by Draco, [[Crabbe and Goyle]]. The diadem is finally destroyed when Crabbe fills this version of the Room with what Hermione believes to have been [[Spells in Harry Potter#(Fiendfyre Curse)|Fiendfyre]]; a destructive magical fire. It is not known if the room continues to function after the events of ''Deathly Hallows''; Ron expresses concern that it may have been ruined in all of its forms by the cursed fire.

===Forbidden Forest===
The Forbidden Forest is a large, dark [[enchanted forest]] in the boundaries of the school grounds. It is usually referred to simply as &quot;the Forest&quot; and in the film series as the &quot;Dark Forest&quot;. It is strictly forbidden to all students, except during Care of Magical Creatures lessons and, on rare occasions, detentions.

Among the plant species within the Forest are trees such as beech, oak, pine, sycamore, yew and knotgrass and thorn undergrowth. Though the Forest is vastly dense and wild, there are a few paths and clearings. Hagrid, who frequently travels into the Forest for various reasons, mostly makes these trails. The Forest is also home to an assortment of [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter|creatures]], many of them dangerous.

In 2017, a Forbidden Forest expansion was added to the [[Warner Bros. Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter]], enabling fans to explore it for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maude|first1=Belinda|title=Harry Potter fans can now visit the Forbidden Forest|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/you-can-now-visit-the-forbidden-forest-from-harry-potter/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=13 August 2017|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sets for exterior==
Most exterior scenes were shot on location at [[Alnwick Castle]], but views of the exterior of the entire school were created from shots of [[Durham Cathedral]] with a digital spire added to the towers. Durham Cathedral also served as a set for Hogwarts interiors.

A scale model was created for exterior shots of the entire school. Models of Alnwick Castle and Durham Cathedral were also built to create more integration between the model and on location shots. It took a team of 86 artists and crew members 74 years worth of man hours to complete the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/explore-the-tour/art-department|title=ART DEPARTMENT|website=wbstudiotour.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hogwarts Express''' is a train that carries students non-stop from [[Platform 9¾|Platform {{frac|9|3|4}}]] at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] in London to [[Hogsmeade]] Station, near Hogwarts. Prefects of the school ride in a separate carriage near the front of the train. The compartments on the train appear to be lettered; in ''Half-Blood Prince'', the &quot;Slug Club&quot; meets in compartment C.

The train began use in the 1850s. Before that, students used to reach Hogwarts on brooms or enchanted carriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J. K.|title=The Hogwarts Express|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-hogwarts-express|website=Pottermore|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steam engine used in the film adaptations is the [[GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall|GWR 4900 Class 5972 ''Olton Hall'']], but it was not the first locomotive to be disguised as the Hogwarts Express. To promote the books, the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] locomotive ''[[SR West Country class 21C127 Taw Valley|34027 Taw Valley]]'' was repainted and renamed temporarily, but was rejected by director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] as looking 'too modern' for the film. Filming locations for the Hogwarts Express sequences include [[Goathland railway station|Goathland]] on the [[North Yorkshire Moors Railway]], [[London King's Cross railway station|Kings Cross railway station]] and the route of the Jacobite Express which follows the [[West Highland Line]] from [[Fort William, Scotland|Fort William]] to [[Mallaig railway station|Mallaig]] in Scotland, as it crosses the [[Glenfinnan Viaduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steamtrain.info/harry.htm|title=Harry Potter Express|publisher=steamtrain.info|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813211628/http://www.steamtrain.info/harry.htm|archivedate=13 August 2008|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several model trains have been made of the Hogwarts Express. An [[00 gauge]] is produced by [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]], though this is of a [[GWR 4073 Class|Castle Class]] locomotive rather than the [[GWR 4900 Class|Hall Class]] used in the films. A [[third rail|three-rail]] [[H0 gauge]] model is produced by [[Märklin]], and a two-rail H0/00 was produced in the early 2000s by [[Bachmann Industries|Bachmann]]. Several now-discontinued [[L gauge]] models have been produced by [[Lego Group|LEGO]].

The [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] translation of the school is &quot;Ὑογοήτου Παιδευτήριον τὸ τῆς Γοητείας καὶ Μαγείας&quot;, loosely translating to &quot;Hogwizard's School of Wizardry and Magic&quot;, ''Ὑογοήτου'' replacing &quot;Hogwarts&quot; and derived from the ancient Greek words ὑo- (hog) and γοητής (wizard).

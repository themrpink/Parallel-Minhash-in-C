{{Demoscene}}
'''Amiga demos''' are [[Demo (computer programming)|demo]]s created for the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] [[home computer]].

A &quot;demo&quot; is a demonstration of the multimedia capabilities of a computer (or more to the point, a demonstration of the skill of the demo's constructors). There was intense rivalry during the 1990s among the best programmers, graphic artists and computer musicians to continually outdo each other's demos. Since the Amiga's hardware was more or less fixed (unlike today's PC industry, where arbitrary combinations of hardware can be put together), there was competition to test the limits of that hardware and perform theoretically &quot;impossible&quot; feats by refactoring the problem at hand. In Europe the Amiga was the undisputed leader of mainstream multimedia computing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, though it was eventually overtaken by PC architecture.

Some Amiga demos, such as the RSI Megademo, Kefrens Megademo VIII or Crionics &amp; The Silents &quot;Hardwired&quot; are considered seminal works in the demo field. New Amiga demos are released even today, although the demo scene has firmly moved onto PC hardware. Many Amiga game developers were active in the demo scene.

The demo scene spearheaded development in multimedia programming techniques for the Amiga, such that it was de rigueur for the latest visual tricks, soundtrackers and 3D algorithms from the demo scene to end up being used in computer game development.

==Demo software==
Most demos were written in [[68000]] [[assembly language]], although a few were written in C and other languages. To utilize full hardware performance, Amiga demos were optimized and written entirely for one purpose in assembly (avoiding generic and portable code). Additional performance was achieved by utilizing several co-processors in parallel with the 68000. These co-processors include, [[Original Amiga chipset#Copper|Copper]] (a co-processor for synchronizing custom chipset writes to video display sync) and [[Blitter]] (a chip capable of quickly moving blocks of graphical data from one position on the screen to another). To achieve the best speed most demos disabled the operating system and addressed the hardware directly.

First bigger demos were released in 1987, one of them was &quot;Tech Tech&quot; by Sodan &amp; Magician 42, it was released in November 1987 and is considered a classic by many.

Eric Schwartz produced a series of animated demos that ran with MoviePlayer, an animation software package similar to [[Macromedia Flash]]. The animated demos drew heavily on the whimsy and graphic style of comic strips.

[[Red Sector Incorporated]] (RSI) produced a piece of software called the RSI Demomaker, which allowed users to script their own demos, replete with scrolltext, vectorballs, plasma screens, etc.

Full demos range from under 128 KB to several megabytes. There have been several thousand demos produced in many countries. Some active demo countries were [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Poland]] and others.

==Intros==
Smaller demos are often known as ''intros''. They are typically limited to between 4 and 64KB in size. Intros were originally used as ''tags'' by [[Software cracking|cracking groups]] on computer games and other software. The purpose of the intro was to advertise cracking and distribution skill of a particular group. Later it developed into a stand-alone art form. Many demo and intro groups disassociated themselves from the cracking and copying scene, although the same people could still be involved in it.

==Ripping==
The Amiga thrived on [[public domain]], [[freeware]] and other not-for-profit development. The architecture provided no substantial mechanism for protecting software from inspection. In order to read the memory one simply performed a hot reset (which preserved the contents of [[RAM]]) and then booted to a dedicated [[floppy disk]] that could inspect and dump the memory's contents. It was therefore common for developers and hackers to &quot;rip&quot; music, graphics and code and then reuse it in their own productions. This led to intense competition in certain fields, for example, in the development of sound tracking software and ''[[Tetris]]'' clones, with each group of developers trying to outdo the current state of the art. In fact, some demos even featured their [[source code]] as part of the executable to save hackers the trouble of disassembly, though it came strewn with incendiary comments for those who would seek to improve on it.

== Plot ==
The plot follows the lives of three veterans returning from service at the end of World War II to the fictional mid-western town of Boone City: bombardier captain Fred Derry; naval petty officer Homer Parrish; and, infantry sergeant Al Stephenson. Before their respective military service, Fred was a [[soda jerk]] who married Marie shortly before shipping out. Al was a banker living with his wife Millie, adult daughter Peggy and teen-aged son Rob. Homer was a star high school athlete living with his parents and sister, next door to his girlfriend, Wilma. Homer lost both arms during the war and returns with mechanical hook prostheses. 

Each man faces challenges integrating back into post-war society. Homer deals with the adjustments he and his family and Wilma face in light of his disability. Al's penchant for alcohol and the adjustments of returning to the banking business cause tension with his family and business associates. Fred, who experiences flashbacks of his bombing raids, becomes frustrated with the wife he barely knows and an employer who fails to appreciate him, and who eventually fires him. Fred and Peggy become attracted to each other which puts the married Fred and Al at odds. Fred eventually leaves his cheating wife, and with no seeming future in Boone City, he decides to catch the next plane out. At the airport, Fred visits an [[aircraft boneyard]] and has another flashback. He is roused by a work crew boss who agrees to hire Fred to help disassemble the war planes for prefabricated housing material. Now divorced, Fred serves as best man at the wedding of Homer and Wilma, where he sees Peggy and they reunite.

Casting brought together established stars as well as character actors and relative unknowns. The jazz drummer [[Gene Krupa]] was seen in archival footage, while [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], later a television star, appeared as an uncredited &quot;hillbilly singer&quot; (in the first of his only three film appearances).{{#tag:ref|At the time the film was shot, Ford was unknown as a singer. He worked in [[San Bernardino]] as a radio announcer-[[disc jockey]].|group=Note}} [[Blake Edwards]], later a film producer and director, appeared fleetingly as an uncredited &quot;Corporal&quot;. Wyler's daughters, Catherine and Judy, were cast as uncredited customers seen in the drug store where Fred Derry works. [[Sean Penn]]'s father, [[Leo Penn|Leo]], played the uncredited part of the soldier working as the scheduling clerk in the A.T.C. Office at the beginning of the film.

Teresa Wright was only thirteen years younger than her on-screen mother, played by Myrna Loy. Michael Hall (1927-2020)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355907/&lt;/ref&gt;, with his role as Fredric March's on-screen son, is absent after the first one-third of the film.

== Production ==
[[Samuel Goldwyn]] was inspired to produce a film about veterans after reading an August 7, 1944, article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' about the difficulties experienced by men returning to civilian life. Goldwyn hired former [[war correspondent]] [[MacKinlay Kantor]] to write a screenplay. His work was first published as a novella, ''Glory for Me'', which Kantor wrote in [[blank verse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kantor|first=MacKinlay|title=Glory for Me|date=1945|publisher=Coward-McCann|oclc=773996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Easton|first=Carol|title=The Search for Sam Goldwyn|date=2014|publisher=Univ.

'Dana', said Kantor with a wry smile, 'I can't afford to write in blank verse, because nobody buys anything written in blank verse.

Sherwood]] then adapted the novella as a screenplay.&lt;ref name=&quot;emanuellevy.com&quot; /&gt;

Director Wyler had flown combat missions over Europe in filming ''[[Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress|Memphis Belle]]'' (1944), and worked hard to get accurate depictions of the combat veterans he had encountered. Wyler changed the original casting that had featured a veteran suffering from [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and sought out Harold Russell, a non-actor, to take on the exacting role of Homer Parrish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orriss p. 121&quot; /&gt;

For ''The Best Years of Our Lives'', he asked the principal actors to purchase their own clothes, in order to connect with daily life and produce an authentic feeling. Other Wyler touches included constructing life-size sets, which went against the standard larger sets that were more suited to camera positions. The impact for the audience was immediate, as each scene played out in a realistic, natural way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orriss p. 121&quot;&gt;Orriss 1984, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recounting the interrelated story of three veterans right after the end of [[World War II]], ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' began filming just over seven months after the war's end, starting on April 15, 1946 at a variety of locations, including the [[Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden]], [[Ontario International Airport]] in [[Ontario, California]], Raleigh Studios in [[Hollywood]], and the Samuel Goldwyn/Warner Hollywood Studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orriss p. 121&quot; /&gt; In ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' [[cinematographer]] [[Gregg Toland]] used [[deep focus]] photography, in which objects both close to and distant from the camera are in sharp [[Focus (optics)|focus]].&lt;ref name=Dave_Kehr&gt;Kehr, Dave.

Retrieved: April 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For the passage of Fred Derry's reliving a combat mission while sitting in the remains of a former bomber, Wyler used &quot;zoom&quot; effects to simulate Derry's subjective state.&lt;ref&gt;Orriss 1984, pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional Boone City was patterned after [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orriss 1984, p. 119&quot; /&gt; The &quot;Jackson High&quot; football stadium seen early in aerial footage of the bomber flying over the Boone City, is [[Corcoran Stadium]] located at Xavier University in Cincinnati. A few seconds later Walnut Hills High School with its dome and football field can be seen along with the downtown Cincinnati skyline ([[Carew Tower]] and [[PNC Tower]]) in the background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/68507/The-Best-Years-of-Our-Lives/trivia.html &quot;Trivia: 'The Best Years of Our Lives'.&quot;] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the combat aircraft featured in the film were being destroyed and disassembled for reuse as scrap material. The scene of Derry's walking among aircraft ruins was filmed at the [[Ontario Air National Guard Station|Ontario Army Air Field]] in Ontario, California. The former training facility had been converted into a scrap yard, housing nearly 2,000 former combat aircraft in various states of disassembly and reclamation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orriss p. 121&quot; /&gt;

=== Critical response ===
Upon its release, ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' received extremely positive reviews from critics. Shortly after its premiere at the [[Astor Theatre (New York City)|Astor Theater, New York]], [[Bosley Crowther]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', hailed the film as a masterpiece. He wrote,
{{quote|It is seldom that there comes a motion picture which can be wholly and enthusiastically endorsed not only as superlative entertainment, but as food for quiet and humanizing thought... In working out their solutions, Mr. Sherwood and Mr. Wyler have achieved some of the most beautiful and inspiring demonstrations of human fortitude that we have had in films.&quot; He also said the [[ensemble cast]]ing gave the &quot;'best' performance in this best film this year from Hollywood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Bosley.

Several decades later, film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] offered tempered praise: &quot;I would concede that ''Best Years'' is decent and humane... acutely observed, despite being so meticulous a package. It would have taken uncommon genius and daring at that time to sneak a view of an untidy or unresolved America past Goldwyn or the public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 2002, p. 949. 4th Edition; the first edition was published in 1975.

''The Best Years of Our Lives'' was a massive commercial success, earning an estimated $10.2 million at the US and Canadian box office during its initial theatrical run,&lt;ref name=1950AllTime&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/variety177-1950-01#page/n371/mode/2up &quot;All-Time Top-Grossers&quot;, ''Variety'' 18 January 1950 p 18]&lt;/ref&gt; not only making it [[1946 in film|the highest-grossing film of 1946]], but also the highest-grossing film of the 1940s decade. It benefited from much larger admission prices than the majority of films released that year which accounted for almost 70% of its earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety169-1948-01#page/n62/mode/1up|title=Upped Scale Films Cop 'Win, Place, Show' Spots in Gross Sweepstakes|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 7, 1948|page=63|accessdate=June 11, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When box office figures are adjusted for inflation, it remains one of the top 100 grossing films in U.S. history.

Among films released before 1950, only ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'', ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'', ''[[The Big Parade]]'' and four Disney titles have done more total business, in part due to later re-releases.

However, because of the distribution arrangement RKO had with Goldwyn, RKO recorded a loss of $660,000 on the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;uni&quot;&gt;Richard B. Jewell, ''Slow Fade to Black: The Decline of RKO Radio Pictures'', Uni of California, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russell Academy Award ===
Despite his Oscar-nominated performance, [[Harold Russell]] was not a professional actor. As the Academy Board of Governors considered him a long shot to win, they gave him an [[Academy Honorary Award]] &quot;for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance&quot;. When Russell in fact won [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], there was an enthusiastic response. He is the only actor to have received two [[Academy Awards]] for the same performance.

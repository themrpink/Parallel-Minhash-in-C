Her mother early favoured a match between one of her children and a member of her English family, and when her nephew [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]] visited Brunswick in June 1781, she lamented the fact that Caroline, because of her age, could not be present very often.&lt;ref name=flora/&gt; Caroline was given a number of proposals from 1782 onward. Marriage with the Prince of Orange, Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, Charles, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and the second son of the Margrave of Baden were all suggested, while her mother and father supported an English and a Prussian Prince respectively, but none came to fruition.&lt;ref name=flora/&gt; Caroline was later to state that her father had forbidden her to marry a man she had fallen in love with because of his low status. The identity of this man is not clear, but contemporaries point out an officer who was referred to at the time as the &quot;Handsome Irishman&quot; who lived in Brunswick, and with whom Caroline was said to have been in love.&lt;ref name=flora/&gt; There was also a rumour that Caroline had given birth at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref name=flora/&gt;

Though she was not allowed to socialise with men, she was allowed to ride, and during riding, she visited the cottages of the peasantry.&lt;ref name=flora/&gt; She had done this already as a child, during which she had met children to play with, and as an adult, one of these visits allegedly led to a pregnancy.&lt;ref name=flora/&gt; There is no confirmation of this rumour, but it was well known during her life, and referred to as a reason for why she married at an older age than was usual, despite being regarded as good-looking and having been given so many proposals.&lt;ref name=flora/&gt;

==Engagement==
[[File:Dupont - Caroline of Brunswick, Princess of Wales.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait by [[Gainsborough Dupont]], {{circa|1795}}]]
In 1794, Caroline and the Prince of Wales were engaged. They had never met—George had agreed to marry her because he was heavily in debt, and if he contracted a marriage with an eligible princess, Parliament would increase his allowance.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline seemed eminently suitable: she was a Protestant of royal birth, and the marriage would ally Brunswick and Britain. Although Brunswick was only a small country, Britain was at war with [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]] and so was eager to obtain allies on the European mainland. Brunswick was ruled by Caroline's father, the esteemed soldier [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick]], who himself had married [[Princess Augusta of Great Britain|Princess Augusta]], the sister of George III. On 20 November 1794, [[James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury|Lord Malmesbury]] arrived at Brunswick to escort Caroline to her new life in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 5; Robins, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In his diary, Malmesbury recorded his reservations about Caroline's suitability as a bride for the prince: she lacked judgement, decorum and tact, spoke her mind too readily, acted indiscreetly, and often neglected to wash, or change her dirty clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Malmesbury's diary quoted in Plowden, pp. 9–18 and Robins, pp. 6–9&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that she had &quot;some natural but no acquired morality, and no strong innate notions of its value and necessity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Plowden, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; However, Malmesbury was impressed by her bravery; on the journey to England, the party heard cannon fire, as they were not far from the French lines. While Caroline's mother, who was accompanying them to the coast as chaperone, was concerned for their safety, Caroline was unfazed.&lt;ref&gt;Malmesbury's diary quoted in Plowden, p. 15 and Robins, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 March 1795, Caroline and Malmesbury left [[Cuxhaven]] in the ''[[HMS Jupiter (1778)|Jupiter]]''. Delayed by poor weather, they landed a week later, on Easter Sunday, 5 April, at [[Greenwich]]. There, she met [[Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey]], George's mistress, who had been appointed Caroline's [[Lady of the Bedchamber]].&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 20–22; Robins, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith concludes that:
: She was chosen as the intended bride of George, Prince of Wales partly because her mother was a favourite sister of George III, partly through the favourable reports of her given by the Dukes of York and Clarence when they visited Germany, and partly for lack of a suitable alternative German protestant princess.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On meeting his future wife for the first time, George called for a glass of brandy. He was evidently disappointed. Similarly, Caroline told Malmesbury, &quot;[the Prince is] very fat and he's nothing like as handsome as his portrait.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Malmesbury's diary quoted in Robins, p. 16 (and in the original French ''le Prince est&amp;nbsp;... très gros, et nullement aussi beau que son portrait'' in Plowden, p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt; At dinner that evening, the Prince was appalled by Caroline's garrulous nature and her jibes at the expense of Lady Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 25; Robins, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; She was upset and disappointed by George's obvious partiality for Lady Jersey over her.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Troubled marriage==

Caroline and George were married on 8 April 1795 at the [[Chapel Royal]], [[St. James's Palace]], in London. At the ceremony, George was drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 26; Robins, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded Caroline as unattractive and unhygienic, and told Malmesbury that he suspected that she was not a virgin when they married.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He, of course, was not. He had himself already secretly married [[Maria Fitzherbert]], but his marriage to Fitzherbert violated the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]] and so was not legally valid.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caroline of Brunswick 1798.jpeg|thumbnail|left|Caroline, Princess of Wales by [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Sir Thomas Lawrence]], 1798]]
In a letter to a friend, the prince claimed that the couple only had sexual intercourse three times: twice the first night of the marriage, and once the second night.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shingleton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first= Hugh M | author= Shingleton |date=November–December 2006 | title= The Tumultuous Marriage of The Prince and The Princess of Wales| journal=ACOG Clinical Review | volume=11 | pages=13–16| issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, &quot;it required no small [effort] to conquer my aversion and overcome the disgust of her person.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins18&quot;&gt;Robins, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline claimed George was so drunk that he &quot;passed the greatest part of his bridal night under the grate, where he fell, and where I left him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine months after the wedding, Caroline gave birth to [[Princess Charlotte of Wales|Princess Charlotte]], George's only legitimate child, at [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]] on 7 January 1796. Charlotte was second in the [[line of succession to the British throne]] after her father. Just three days after Charlotte's birth, George made out a new will. He left all his property to &quot;Maria Fitzherbert, my wife&quot;, while to Caroline he left one [[shilling]].&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 39–40; Robins, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Gossip about Caroline and George's troubled marriage was already circulating.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; The newspapers claimed that Lady Jersey opened, read and distributed the contents of Caroline's private letters.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 44; Robins, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; She despised Lady Jersey and could not visit or travel anywhere without George's permission.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The press vilified George for his extravagance and luxury at a time of war and portrayed Caroline as a wronged wife.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 48; Robins, pp. 19, 21&lt;/ref&gt; She was cheered in public and gained plaudits for her &quot;winning familiarity&quot; and easy, open nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins18&quot;/&gt; George was dismayed at her popularity and his own unpopularity, and felt trapped in a loveless marriage with a woman he loathed. He wanted a separation.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1796, George wrote to Caroline, &quot;We have unfortunately been oblig'd to acknowledge to each other that we cannot find happiness in our union.&amp;nbsp;... Let me therefore beg you to make the best of a situation unfortunate for us both.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Lady Jersey resigned as Caroline's Lady of the Bedchamber.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; George and Caroline were already living separately, and in August 1797 Caroline moved to a private residence: The Vicarage or Old Rectory in [[Charlton, London]].&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 55; Robins, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she moved to [[Montagu House, Blackheath|Montagu House]] in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]. No longer constrained by her husband, or, according to rumour, her marital vows, she entertained whomever she pleased.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 62–65; Robins, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; She flirted with Admiral Sir [[Sidney Smith (admiral)|Sidney Smith]] and Captain [[Thomas Manby]], and may have had a brief relationship with the politician [[George Canning]].&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delicate Investigation===
[[File:Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence, 1804]]
Charlotte was placed in the care of a governess, in a mansion near Montagu House in the summers, and Caroline visited her often.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 60; Robins, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that a single daughter was not sufficient to sate Caroline's maternal instincts, and she adopted eight or nine poor children who were fostered out to people in the district.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, she adopted a three-month-old boy, William Austin, and took him into her home. By 1805, Caroline had fallen out with her near neighbours, [[John Douglas (Royal Marines officer)|Sir John and Lady Douglas]], who claimed that Caroline had sent them obscene and harassing letters. Lady Douglas accused Caroline of infidelity, and alleged that William Austin was Caroline's illegitimate son.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 75–78; Robins, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806, a secret commission was set up, known as the &quot;Delicate Investigation&quot;, to examine Lady Douglas's claims. The commission comprised four of the most eminent men in the country: Prime Minister [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]], the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Lord Erskine]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]] [[Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]] and the [[Home Secretary]] [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 79; Robins, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Douglas testified that Caroline herself had admitted to her in 1802 that she was pregnant, and that Austin was her son.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 69–71; Robins, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; She further alleged that Caroline had been rude about the royal family, touched her in an inappropriately sexual way, and had admitted that any woman friendly with a man was sure to become his lover.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 78; Robins, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Smith, Manby and Canning, artist [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Thomas Lawrence]] and Henry Hood (the son of [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]]) were also mentioned as potential paramours. Caroline's servants could or would not confirm that these gentlemen were her lovers, nor that she had been pregnant, and said that the child had been brought to Caroline's house by his true mother, Sophia Austin. Sophia was summoned before the commissioners, and testified that the child was hers.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 79–82; Robins, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The commissioners decided that there was &quot;no foundation&quot; for the allegations, but despite being a supposedly secret investigation, it proved impossible to prevent gossip from spreading, and news of the investigation leaked to the press.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline's conduct with her gentlemen friends was considered improper, but there was no direct proof that she had been guilty of anything more than flirtation. Perhaps Caroline had told Lady Douglas that she was pregnant out of frustrated maternal desire, or as part of a foolish prank that, unfortunately for her, backfired.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, Caroline received further bad news as Brunswick was overrun by the French, and her father was killed in the [[battle of Jena-Auerstadt]]. Her mother and brother, [[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], fled to England. Caroline had wanted to return to Brunswick and leave Britain behind her, but with much of Europe controlled by the French she had no safe haven to run to.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Delicate Investigation, Caroline was not permitted to see her daughter, and afterwards her visits were essentially restricted to once a week and only in the presence of Caroline's own mother, the Dowager Duchess of Brunswick.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 109, 128&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings took place at either Blackheath or an apartment in [[Kensington Palace]] designated for Caroline's use.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social isolation===
[[File:Anticipations for the Pillory.jpg|thumb|Satirical cartoon showing Sir John and Lady Douglas being led to the pillory outside Montagu House, Blackheath, after being discredited in giving evidence against Caroline]]
By the end of 1811, King George III had become permanently insane, and the Prince of Wales was appointed as [[Regent]]. He restricted Caroline's access to Princess Charlotte further, and Caroline became more socially isolated as members of high society chose to patronise George's extravagant parties rather than hers.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 122, 133; Robins, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; She moved her London residence to Connaught House in Bayswater.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline needed a powerful ally to help her oppose George's increasing ability to prevent her from seeing her daughter. In league with [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], an ambitious [[British Whig Party|Whig]] politician who favoured reform, she began a propaganda campaign against George.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 37–41&lt;/ref&gt; George countered by leaking Lady Douglas's testimony from the &quot;Delicate Investigation&quot;, which Brougham repudiated by leaking the testimonies of the servants and Mrs Austin.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte favoured her mother's point of view, as did most of the public. [[Jane Austen]] wrote of Caroline: &quot;Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she ''is'' a Woman and because I hate her Husband.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Jane Austen to [[Martha Lloyd]], 16 February 1813, quoted in Robins, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814, after [[Napoleon]]'s defeat, nobility from throughout Europe attended [[Allied sovereigns' visit to England|celebrations in London]], but Caroline was excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 184–185; Robins, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; George's relationship with his daughter was also deteriorating, as Charlotte sought greater freedom from her father's strictures. On 12 July, he informed Charlotte that she would henceforth be confined at [[Cranbourne Lodge]], Windsor, that her household would be replaced, and that she could have no visitors except her grandmother, [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]], once a week.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt; Horrified, Charlotte ran away to her mother's house in Bayswater.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt; After an anxious night, Charlotte was eventually persuaded to return to her father by Brougham, since legally she could be placed in her father's care and there was a danger of public disorder against George, which might prejudice Charlotte's position if she continued to disobey him.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt;

Caroline, unhappy at her situation and treatment in Britain, negotiated a deal with the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Lord Castlereagh]]. She agreed to leave the country in exchange for an annual allowance of £35,000. Both Brougham and Charlotte were dismayed by Caroline's decision, as they both realised that Caroline's absence would strengthen George's power and weaken theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 47–50&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 1814, Caroline left Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile==
After a two-week visit to Brunswick, Caroline headed for Italy through Switzerland. Along the way, possibly in [[Milan]], she hired Bartolomeo Pergami as a servant.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; Pergami soon rose to the head of Caroline's household, and managed to get his sister, Angelica, Countess of Oldi, appointed as Caroline's [[lady-in-waiting]].&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1815, Caroline bought a house, [[Villa d'Este (Cernobbio)|Villa d'Este]], on the shores of [[Lake Como]], even though her finances were stretched.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

From early 1816, she and Pergami went on a cruise around the Mediterranean, visiting Napoleon's former palace on [[Elba]], and [[Sicily]], where Pergami obtained the [[Order of Malta]] and a barony.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Caroline and Pergami were eating their meals together openly, and it was widely rumoured that they were lovers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Letter of [[Howe Browne, 2nd Marquess of Sligo|Lord Sligo]] quoted in Robins, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; They visited [[Tunis]], [[Malta]], [[Milos]], Athens, [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Constantinople]], and [[Nazareth]]. Caroline entered [[Jerusalem]] riding on a donkey in a convoy of camels.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 69–72&lt;/ref&gt; Pergami was made a Knight of the [[Order of Saint Lazarus]]. Caroline instituted the Order of Saint Caroline, nominating Pergami its Grand Master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7246065|title=British Royal History: Queen Be |publisher= The Economist|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, they returned to Italy, stopping at Rome to visit the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Long and Short of the Tale by George Cruikshank.jpg|thumb|A caricature by [[George Cruikshank]] mocking Caroline for her supposed affair with Pergami]]
By this time, gossip about Caroline was everywhere. [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] wrote to his publisher that Caroline and Pergami were lovers,&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Byron to [[John Murray (1778–1843)|John Murray]], January 1817, quoted in Robins, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; and Sir [[Francis Ronalds]] described and made a sketch of their sleeping arrangements in [[Karlsruhe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sirfrancisronalds.co.uk/switz.html|title=Sir Francis Ronalds' Travel Journal: Switzerland and Germany|website=Sir Francis Ronalds and his Family|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Friedrich Ompteda, a Hanoverian spy, bribed one of Caroline's servants so that he could search her bedroom for proof of adultery. He found none.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; By August 1817, Caroline's debts were growing, so she sold Villa d'Este and moved to the smaller [[Villa Caprile, Pesaro|Villa Caprile]] near [[Pesaro]]. Pergami's mother, brother and daughter, but not his wife, joined Caroline's household.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous year, Caroline's daughter, Princess Charlotte, had married [[Leopold I of Belgium|Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]], and the future of the British monarchy looked bright. Then tragedy struck: in November 1817, Charlotte died after giving birth to her only child, a stillborn son. For the most part, Charlotte had been immensely popular with the public, and her death was a blow to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, pp. 260–263; Robins, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; George refused to write to Caroline to inform her, leaving it for their son-in-law Leopold to do, but Leopold was deep in grief and delayed writing. George did, however, write to the pope of the tragedy, and by chance the courier carrying the letter passed by Pesaro, and so it was that Caroline heard the devastating news.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline had lost her daughter, but she had also lost any chance of regaining position through the succession of her daughter to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

George was determined to press ahead with a divorce and set up a commission chaired by the [[Chancellor of the High Court|Vice-Chancellor]] [[John Leach (judge)|John Leach]] to gather evidence of Caroline's adultery. Leach sent three commissioners to Milan to interrogate Caroline's former servants, including [[Theodore Majocchi]] and Caroline's maid, Louise Demont.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; In London, Brougham was still acting as Caroline's agent. Concerned that the &quot;Milan commission&quot; might threaten Caroline, he sent his brother [[James Brougham|James]] to Caroline's villa in the hope of establishing whether George had any grounds for divorce. James wrote back to his brother of Caroline and Pergami, &quot;they are to all appearances man and wife, never was anything so obvious.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[James Brougham]] to his brother Henry, quoted in Robins, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The Milan commission was assembling more and more evidence, and by 1819 Caroline was worried. She informed James Brougham that she would agree to a divorce in exchange for money.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; However, at this time in England divorce by mutual consent was illegal; it was only possible to divorce if one of the partners admitted or was found guilty of adultery. Caroline said it was &quot;impossible&quot; for her to admit that, so the Broughams advised that only formal separation was possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;p80&quot;&gt;Robins, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Both keen to avoid publicity, the Broughams and the Government discussed a deal where Caroline would be called by a lesser title, such as &quot;[[Duchess of Cornwall]]&quot; rather than &quot;[[Princess of Wales]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p80&quot;/&gt; As the negotiations continued at the end of 1819, Caroline travelled to France, which gave rise to speculation that she was on her way back to England. In January 1820, however, she made plans to return to Italy, but then on 29 January 1820 King George III died. Caroline's husband became king and, at least nominally, she was queen of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queen consort==
{{see |Pains and Penalties Bill 1820}}
[[File:Trial of Queen Caroline by Sir George Hayter.jpg|thumb|''The Trial of Queen Caroline'', 1820 by [[George Hayter|Sir George Hayter]]]]
Instead of being treated like a queen, Caroline found that her estranged husband's accession paradoxically made her position worse. On visiting Rome, the pope refused her an audience, and the pope's minister [[Ercole Consalvi|Cardinal Consalvi]] insisted that she be greeted only as a duchess of Brunswick, and not as a queen.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to assert her rights, she made plans to return to Britain. The king demanded that his ministers get rid of her. He successfully persuaded them to remove her name from the [[liturgy]] of the [[Church of England]], but they would not agree to a divorce because they feared the effect of a public trial. The government was weak and unpopular, and a trial detailing salacious details of both Caroline's and George's separate love lives was certain to destabilise it further.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 96–100&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than run the risk, the government entered into negotiations with Caroline, and offered her an increased annuity of £50,000 if she stayed abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Queen Caroline of Brunswick.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by Samuel Lane, 1820]]
By the beginning of June 1820, Caroline had travelled north from Italy, and was at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] near [[Calais]]. Acting on the advice of [[Alderman]] [[Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet|Matthew Wood]] and her lady-in-waiting [[Anne Hamilton (1766–1846)|Lady Anne Hamilton]], she rejected the government's offer.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; She bid farewell to Pergami, and embarked for England. When she arrived on 5 June, riots broke out in support of her.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 269; Robins, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline was a figurehead for the growing [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical movement]] that demanded political reform and opposed the unpopular king.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the king still adamantly desired a divorce, and the following day, he submitted the evidence gathered by the Milan commission to Parliament in two green bags. On 15 June, the guards in the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]] mutinied. The mutiny was contained, but the government was fearful of further unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of the bags of evidence was delayed as Parliament debated the form of the investigation, but eventually, on 27 June, they were opened and examined in secret by 15 [[Peer of the realm|peers]]. The peers considered the contents scandalous, and a week later, after their report to the House, the government introduced a bill in Parliament, the [[Pains and Penalties Bill 1820]], to strip Caroline of the title of queen and dissolve her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 132–143&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that Caroline had committed adultery with a low-born man: Bartolomeo Pergami. Various witnesses, such as [[Theodore Majocchi]], were called during the reading of the bill, which was effectively a public trial of the queen. The trial caused a sensation, as details of Caroline's familiarity with Pergami were revealed. Witnesses said the couple had slept in the same room, kissed, and been seen together in a state of undress.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 193–202&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed the [[House of Lords]], but was not submitted to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as there was little prospect that the Commons would pass it. To her friends, Caroline joked that she had indeed committed adultery once—with the husband of Mrs. Fitzherbert, the king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shingleton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Moore]]'s ''Memoirs'', (London, 1853) vol. III, p. 149 quoted in Robins, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Even during the trial, the queen remained immensely popular, as witnessed by over 800 petitions and nearly a million signatures that favoured her cause.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; As a figurehead of the opposition movement demanding reform, many revolutionary pronouncements were made in Caroline's name.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 159–164, 240–242&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=All classes will ever find in me a sincere friend to their liberties, and a zealous advocate of their rights. |author=Queen Caroline, September 1820, quoted in Robins, p. 240}}
{{Quote|text=A government cannot stop the [[March of Intellect|march of intellect]] any more than they can arrest the motion of the tides or the course of the planets. |author=Queen Caroline quoted in ''The Times'', 7 October 1820}}
But with the end of the trial her alliance with the radicals came to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; The government again extended the offer of £50,000 a year, this time without preconditions, and Caroline accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 305–306&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Modesty 1821.jpg|thumb|''Modesty!'', etching published by G. Humphrey, London, 1821: Caroline of Brunswick, at a theatre in Genoa, with her secretary and constant companion Bartolomeo Pergami.]]
Despite the king's best attempts, Caroline retained a strong popularity among the masses, and pressed ahead with plans to attend the [[Coronation of George IV|coronation service]] on 19 July 1821 as queen. Lord Liverpool told Caroline that she should not go to the service, but she turned up anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 276; Robins, pp. 308–309&lt;/ref&gt; George had Caroline turned away from the coronation at the doors of [[Westminster Abbey]]. Refused entry at both the doors to the East Cloister and the doors to the West Cloister, Caroline attempted to enter via [[Westminster Hall]], where many guests were gathered before the service began.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; A witness described how the queen stood at the door fuming as bayonets were held under her chin until the deputy [[Lord Chamberlain|lord chamberlain]] had the doors slammed in her face.&lt;ref&gt;Miss Elizabeth Robertson quoted in Robins, pp. 310–311&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline then proceeded back to an entrance near [[Poets' Corner]], where she was met by [[Sir Robert Inglis, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Inglis]], who held the office of &quot;Gold Staff&quot;. Inglis persuaded her to return to her carriage, and she left. Caroline lost support through her exhibition at the coronation; the crowds jeered her as she rode away,&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; and even Brougham recorded his distaste at her undignified behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thomas Creevey|Creevey Papers]]'' edited by [[Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet]] (1903). London: John Murray. pp. 361–362, quoted in Robins, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

That night, Caroline fell ill and took a large dose of [[milk of magnesia]] and some drops of [[laudanum]].&lt;ref&gt;Robins, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next three weeks she suffered more and more pain as her condition deteriorated. She realised she was nearing death and put her affairs in order. Her papers, letters, memoirs, and notebooks were burned. She wrote a new will, and settled her funeral arrangements: she was to be buried in her native Brunswick in a tomb bearing the inscription &quot;Here lies Caroline, the Injured {{sic|Queen of England}}&quot;.&lt;ref name=p313&gt;Robins, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; She died at Brandenburg House in [[Hammersmith]] at 10:25&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 7 August 1821 at the age of 53. Her physicians thought she had an intestinal obstruction,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shingleton&quot;/&gt; but she may have had cancer,&lt;ref&gt;Plowden, p. 276; Robins, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; and there were rumours at the time that she had been poisoned.&lt;ref name=p313/&gt;

Afraid that a procession of the funeral [[bier]] through London could spark public unrest, Lord Liverpool decided the queen's cortège would avoid the city, passing to the north on the way to [[Harwich]] and Brunswick. The crowd accompanying the procession was incensed and blocked the intended route with barricades to force a new route through [[Westminster]] and [[City of London|London]]. The scene soon descended into chaos; the soldiers forming the honour guard opened fire and rode through the crowd with drawn sabres. People in the crowd threw cobblestones and bricks at the soldiers, and two members of the public—Richard Honey, a carpenter, and George Francis, a bricklayer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/31505964@N08/12958254664/|title=Grave of Richard Honey and George Francis, St Paul's Hammersmith|publisher=Flickr|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—were killed. Eventually, [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Chief Metropolitan Magistrate]] Sir Robert Baker, ordered that the official route be abandoned, and the cortège passed through the city. As a result, Baker was dismissed from office.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, pp. 314–317&lt;/ref&gt;

The final route (in heavy rain) took the following course: [[Hammersmith]], [[Kensington]] (blocked), [[Kensington Gore]] (blocked), [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] (blocked), return to Hyde Park where soldiers forced the gates open, Cumberland Gate (blocked), [[Edgware Road]], [[Tottenham Court Road]], [[Drury Lane]], the [[Strand, London|Strand]], and from there through the [[City of London]], then by way of [[Romford]], [[Chelmsford]], and [[Colchester]], to the seaport of [[Harwich]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Chambers, Book of Days&lt;/ref&gt; where it was placed on a ship bound for [[Brunswick Cathedral]], Caroline's final resting place.

==Legacy==
Historian Thomas Laqueur emphasises that the sordid royal squabble captivated all Britons:
: During much of 1820 the &quot;queen's business&quot; captivated the nation. &quot;It was the only question I have ever known,&quot; wrote the radical critic [[William Hazlitt]], &quot;that excited a thorough popular feeling.  It struck its roots into the heart of the nation; it took possession of every house or cottage in the kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Laquer (1982) p 417&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Caroline's marriage to George and her battle to be recognised as queen served as the basis for the 1996 [[BBC]] [[docudrama]] ''[[A Royal Scandal]]'' with [[Susan Lynch]] as Caroline and [[Richard E. Grant]] as George IV. The 2008 radio play ''[[The People's Princess (radio play)|The People's Princess]]'', with [[Alex Jennings]] as George IV and [[Rebecca Saire]] as Caroline, drew parallels with the marriage and divorce of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. Caroline is the subject of [[Richard Condon]]'s 1977 novel ''The Abandoned Woman''.

The final conflict between the newly ascended George IV and the soon-to-die Caroline is the subject of [[Robert Barnard|Bernard Bastable]]'s novel ''Dead, Mr. Mozart'', where an [[alternate history]] [[Mozart]], who had a long life in England instead of a short life in Austria, is drawn against his will into a cover-up of information reflecting badly on all sides.

{{About|the role a person may take as a model||Model (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Model Posing On Typical Studio Set.jpg|thumb|Model [[Caitlin O'Connor]] posing on a typical studio shooting set]]

A '''model''' is a person with a [[role]] either to [[Promotion (marketing)|promote]], display or [[advertise]] commercial [[product (business)|products]] (notably [[fashion]] clothing in [[fashion show]]s), or to serve as a visual aid for people who are creating [[works of art]] or to pose for photography. Though models are predominantly female, there are also male models, especially to model clothing. Models may work professionally or casually.

'''Modelling''' (&quot;modeling&quot; in [[British and American English spelling differences#Doubled consonants|American English]]) is considered to be different from other types of public [[performance]], such as acting or dancing. Although the difference between modelling and performing is not always clear, appearing in a film or a play is not generally considered to be &quot;modelling&quot;. Similarly, appearing in a TV advertisement is generally not considered modelling. Modelling generally does not involve speaking. Personal opinions are generally not expressed, and a model's reputation and image are considered critical.

Types of modelling include: fashion, glamour, fitness, bikini, fine art, body-part, promotional, and commercial print models. Models are featured in a variety of media formats including: books, magazines, films, newspapers, internet and television. Fashion modelling as a profession is sometimes featured in films (''[[Prêt-à-Porter (film)|Prêt-à-Porter]]'' and ''[[Looker]]''), [[Reality television|reality TV]] shows (''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' and ''[[The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency]]''), and music videos (&quot;[[Freedom! '90]]&quot;, &quot;[[Wicked Game]]&quot;, &quot;[[Daughters (John Mayer song)|Daughters]]&quot; and &quot;[[Blurred Lines]]&quot;).

[[Celebrities]], including actors, singers, [[sportsperson|sports personalities]] and reality TV stars, frequently participate in modelling contests, assignments as well as contracts in addition to their regular work. Often, modelling is not a full-time, main activity.

==History==
===Early years===
Modelling as a profession was first established in 1853 by [[Charles Frederick Worth]], the &quot;father of [[haute couture]]&quot;, when he asked his wife, Marie Vernet Worth, to model the clothes he designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modelworker.com/history.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017020950/http://www.modelworker.com/history.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-10-17|title=modelworker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fabulous faces of fashion: A century of modelling|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/fabulous-faces-of-fashion-a--century-of-modelling-1678417.html|date=4 May 2009|author=Walker, Harriet|journal=The Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528025946/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/fabulous-faces-of-fashion-a--century-of-modelling-1678417.html|archive-date=2011-05-28|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;[[house model]]&quot; was coined to describe this type of work. Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle époque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].

With the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models. One of the most popular models during the 1940s was [[Jinx Falkenburg]] who was paid $25 per hour, a large sum at the time;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401102507/http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-04-01 |title=fashion models 1940s, fashion modeling in 1940, Forties Fashion modeling agencies, first fashion modeling agency in New York, 1940s fashion models, John Powers modeling agency, girls of the John Roberts Powers modeling agency, Powers Girls Photographs, popular 1 |publisher=Oldmagazinearticles.com |access-date=2012-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through the 1950s, [[Wilhelmina Cooper]], [[Jean Patchett]], [[Dovima]], [[Dorian Leigh]], [[Suzy Parker]], [[Evelyn Tripp]], and [[Carmen Dell'Orefice]] also dominated fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |author=Cathy Horyn|date=4 February 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |title=Jean Patchett, 75, a Model Who Helped Define the 50s |newspaper=New York Times |access-date=19 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829054807/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |archive-date=29 August 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothea Church]] was among the first black models in the industry to gain recognition in Paris. However, these models were unknown outside the fashion community. [[Wilhelmina Cooper]]'s measurements were 38&quot;-24&quot;-36&quot; whereas [[Chanel Iman]]'s measurements are 32&quot;-23&quot;-33&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/Chanel_Iman |title=Chanel Iman – Fashion Model – Profile on FMD |publisher=Fashionmodeldirectory.com |access-date=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830212536/http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/chanel_iman/ |archive-date=2012-08-30 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, [[Ford Models]] was established by [[Eileen Ford|Eileen]] and [[Gerard W. Ford|Gerard Ford]] in New York; it is one of the oldest model agencies in the world.

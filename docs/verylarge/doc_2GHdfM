Both helper and cytotoxic T-cells can control viral infections by secreting interferons. Cytotoxic T cells usually kill virally infected cells. However, they can also be stimulated to secrete antiviral cytokines such as [[Interferon gamma|IFN-γ]] and [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNF-α]], which do not kill the cell, but limit viral infection by down-regulating the expression of viral components.&lt;ref name=Franco1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franco A, Guidotti LG, Hobbs MV, Pasquetto V, Chisari FV | title = Pathogenetic effector function of CD4-positive T helper 1 cells in hepatitis B virus transgenic mice | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 159 | issue = 4 | pages = 2001–8 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9257867 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/159/4/2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA vaccinations can be used to curb viral infections by non-destructive IFN-mediated control.

== Immune response modulation ==

=== Cytokine modulation ===

An effective vaccine must induce an appropriate immune response for a given pathogen. DNA vaccines can polarise T-cell help towards TH1 or TH2 profiles and generate CTL and/or antibody when required. This can be accomplished by modifications to the form of antigen expressed (i.e. intracellular vs. secreted), the method and route of delivery or the dose.&lt;ref name=Feltquate1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=References1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cardoso1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cardoso AI, Blixenkrone-Moller M, Fayolle J, Liu M, Buckland R, Wild TF | title = Immunization with plasmid DNA encoding for the measles virus hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein leads to humoral and cell-mediated immunity | journal = Virology | volume = 225 | issue = 2 | pages = 293–9 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8918915 | doi = 10.1006/viro.1996.0603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sato1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sato Y, Roman M, Tighe H, Lee D, Corr M, Nguyen MD, Silverman GJ, Lotz M, Carson DA, Raz E | title = Immunostimulatory DNA sequences necessary for effective intradermal gene immunization | journal = Science | volume = 273 | issue = 5273 | pages = 352–4 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8662521 | doi = 10.1126/science.273.5273.352 | bibcode = 1996Sci...273..352S | s2cid = 9333197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss R, Leitner WW, Scheiblhofer S, Chen D, Bernhaupt A, Mostböck S, Thalhamer J, Lyon JA | title = Genetic vaccination against malaria infection by intradermal and epidermal injections of a plasmid containing the gene encoding the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 68 | issue = 10 | pages = 5914–9 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 10992502 | pmc = 101554 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.68.10.5914-5919.2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be accomplished by the co-administration of plasmid DNA encoding immune regulatory molecules, i.e. cytokines, [[lymphokine]]s or co-stimulatory molecules. These “genetic [[adjuvants]]” can be administered as a:
* mixture of 2 plasmids, one encoding the immunogen and the other encoding the cytokine
* single bi- or polycistronic vector, separated by spacer regions
* plasmid-encoded [[Fusion protein|chimera]], or fusion protein
In general, co-administration of pro-inflammatory agents (such as various [[interleukins]], [[tumor necrosis factor]], and GM-CSF) plus TH2-inducing cytokines increase antibody responses, whereas pro-inflammatory agents and TH1-inducing cytokines decrease humoral responses and increase cytotoxic responses (more important in viral protection). Co-stimulatory molecules such as [[CD80|B7-1]], [[CD86|B7-2]] and [[CD154|CD40L]] are sometimes used.

This concept was applied in topical administration of pDNA encoding [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]].&lt;ref name=Daheshia1997 /&gt; Plasmid encoding B7-1 (a ligand on APCs) successfully enhanced the immune response in tumour models. Mixing plasmids encoding GM-CSF and the circumsporozoite protein of ''P. yoelii'' (PyCSP) enhanced protection against subsequent challenge (whereas plasmid-encoded PyCSP alone did not). It was proposed that GM-CSF caused dendritic cells to present antigen more efficiently and enhance IL-2 production and TH cell activation, thus driving the increased immune response.&lt;ref name=Weiss1998 /&gt; This can be further enhanced by first priming with a pPyCSP and pGM-CSF mixture, followed by boosting with a recombinant [[Poxviridae|poxvirus]] expressing PyCSP.&lt;ref name=Sedegah2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sedegah M, Weiss W, Sacci JB, Charoenvit Y, Hedstrom R, Gowda K, Majam VF, Tine J, Kumar S, Hobart P, Hoffman SL | title = Improving protective immunity induced by DNA-based immunization: priming with antigen and GM-CSF-encoding plasmid DNA and boosting with antigen-expressing recombinant poxvirus | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 164 | issue = 11 | pages = 5905–12 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10820272 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.164.11.5905 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, co-injection of plasmids encoding GM-CSF (or IFN-γ, or IL-2) and a fusion protein of ''[[Plasmodium chabaudi|P. chabaudi]]'' [[Apicomplexan life cycle|merozoite surface protein]] 1 (C-terminus)-hepatitis B virus surface protein (PcMSP1-HBs) abolished protection against challenge, compared to protection acquired by delivery of pPcMSP1-HBs alone.&lt;ref name=Wunderlich2000 /&gt;

The advantages of genetic adjuvants are their low cost and simple administration, as well as avoidance of unstable [[recombinant cytokine]]s and potentially toxic, “conventional” adjuvants (such as [[alum]], [[calcium phosphate]], monophosphoryl lipid A, [[cholera]] toxin, cationic and mannan-coated liposomes, [[QS21]], [[carboxymethyl cellulose]] and [[Ubenimex|ubenimix]]).&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis1999 /&gt; However, the potential toxicity of prolonged cytokine expression is not established. In many commercially important animal species, cytokine genes have not been identified and isolated. In addition, various plasmid-encoded cytokines modulate the immune system differently according to the delivery time. For example, some cytokine plasmid DNAs are best delivered after immunogen pDNA, because pre- or co-delivery can decrease specific responses and increase non-specific responses.&lt;ref name=Barouch1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barouch DH, Santra S, Steenbeke TD, Zheng XX, Perry HC, Davies ME, Freed DC, Craiu A, Strom TB, Shiver JW, Letvin NL | title = Augmentation and suppression of immune responses to an HIV-1 DNA vaccine by plasmid cytokine/Ig administration | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 161 | issue = 4 | pages = 1875–82 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9712056 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/161/4/1875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immunostimulatory CpG motifs ===

Plasmid DNA itself appears to have an adjuvant effect on the immune system.&lt;ref name=Alarcon1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; Bacterially derived DNA can trigger innate immune defence mechanisms, the activation of dendritic cells and the production of TH1 cytokines.&lt;ref name=Jakob1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Krieg1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krieg AM, Yi AK, Matson S, Waldschmidt TJ, Bishop GA, Teasdale R, Koretzky GA, Klinman DM | s2cid = 4261304 | title = CpG motifs in bacterial DNA trigger direct B-cell activation | journal = Nature | volume = 374 | issue = 6522 | pages = 546–9 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7700380 | doi = 10.1038/374546a0 | bibcode = 1995Natur.374..546K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to recognition of certain CpG dinucleotide sequences that are immunostimulatory.&lt;ref name=Sato1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klinman1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klinman DM, Yamshchikov G, Ishigatsubo Y | title = Contribution of CpG motifs to the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 158 | issue = 8 | pages = 3635–9 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9103425 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/158/8/3635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CpG stimulatory (CpG-S) sequences occur twenty times more frequently in bacterially-derived DNA than in eukaryotes. This is because eukaryotes exhibit “CpG suppression” – i.e. CpG dinucleotide pairs occur much less frequently than expected. Additionally, CpG-S sequences are hypomethylated. This occurs frequently in bacterial DNA, while CpG motifs occurring in eukaryotes are methylated at the cytosine nucleotide. In contrast, nucleotide sequences that inhibit the activation of an immune response (termed CpG neutralising, or CpG-N) are over represented in eukaryotic genomes.&lt;ref name=Krieg1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krieg AM, Wu T, Weeratna R, Efler SM, Love-Homan L, Yang L, Yi AK, Short D, Davis HL | title = Sequence motifs in adenoviral DNA block immune activation by stimulatory CpG motifs | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 21 | pages = 12631–6 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9770537 | pmc = 22882 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.21.12631 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...9512631K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal immunostimulatory sequence is an unmethylated CpG dinucleotide flanked by two 5’ [[purine]]s and two 3’ [[pyrimidine]]s.&lt;ref name=Sato1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Krieg1995 /&gt; Additionally, flanking regions outside this immunostimulatory [[Oligomer|hexamer]] must be [[guanine]]-rich to ensure binding and uptake into target cells.

The innate system works with the adaptive immune system to mount a response against the DNA encoded protein. CpG-S sequences induce polyclonal B-cell activation and the upregulation of cytokine expression and secretion.&lt;ref name=Klinsman1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klinman DM, Yi AK, Beaucage SL, Conover J, Krieg AM | title = CpG motifs present in bacteria DNA rapidly induce lymphocytes to secrete interleukin 6, interleukin 12, and interferon gamma | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 7 | pages = 2879–83 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8610135 | pmc = 39727 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.7.2879 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...93.2879K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stimulated macrophages secrete IL-12, [[IL18BP|IL-18]], TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ, while stimulated B-cells secrete IL-6 and some IL-12.&lt;ref name=Lewis1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klinsman1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yi1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yi AK, Chace JH, Cowdery JS, Krieg AM | title = IFN-gamma promotes IL-6 and IgM secretion in response to CpG motifs in bacterial DNA and oligodeoxynucleotides | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 156 | issue = 2 | pages = 558–64 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 8543806 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/156/2/558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manipulation of CpG-S and CpG-N sequences in the plasmid backbone of DNA vaccines can ensure the success of the immune response to the encoded antigen and drive the immune response toward a TH1 phenotype. This is useful if a pathogen requires a TH response for protection. CpG-S sequences have also been used as external adjuvants for both DNA and recombinant protein vaccination with variable success rates. Other organisms with hypomethylated CpG motifs have demonstrated the stimulation of polyclonal B-cell expansion. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The mechanism behind this may be more complicated than simple methylation – hypomethylated murine DNA has not been found to mount an immune response.

Most of the evidence for immunostimulatory CpG sequences comes from murine studies. Extrapolation of this data to other species requires caution – individual species may require different flanking sequences, as binding specificities of scavenger receptors vary across species. Additionally, species such as ruminants may be insensitive to immunostimulatory sequences due to their large gastrointestinal load.

=== Alternative boosts ===

DNA-primed immune responses can be boosted by the administration of recombinant protein or recombinant poxviruses. &quot;Prime-boost&quot; strategies with recombinant protein have successfully increased both neutralising antibody titre, and antibody avidity and persistence, for weak immunogens, such as HIV-1 envelope protein.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Letvin1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Letvin NL, Montefiori DC, Yasutomi Y, Perry HC, Davies ME, Lekutis C, Alroy M, Freed DC, Lord CI, Handt LK, Liu MA, Shiver JW | title = Potent, protective anti-HIV immune responses generated by bimodal HIV envelope DNA plus protein vaccination | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 17 | pages = 9378–83 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9256490 | pmc = 23198 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.17.9378 | bibcode = 1997PNAS...94.9378L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recombinant virus boosts have been shown to be very efficient at boosting DNA-primed CTL responses. Priming with DNA focuses the immune response on the required immunogen, while boosting with the recombinant virus provides a larger amount of expressed antigen, leading to a large increase in specific CTL responses.

Prime-boost strategies have been successful in inducing protection against malarial challenge in a number of studies. Primed mice with plasmid DNA encoding ''Plasmodium yoelii'' circumsporozoite surface protein (PyCSP), then boosted with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the same protein had significantly higher levels of antibody, CTL activity and IFN-γ, and hence higher levels of protection, than mice immunized and boosted with plasmid DNA alone.&lt;ref name=Sedegah1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sedegah M, Jones TR, Kaur M, Hedstrom R, Hobart P, Tine JA, Hoffman SL | title = Boosting with recombinant vaccinia increases immunogenicity and protective efficacy of malaria DNA vaccine | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 13 | pages = 7648–53 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9636204 | pmc = 22711 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.13.7648 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.7648S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be further enhanced by priming with a mixture of plasmids encoding PyCSP and murine GM-CSF, before boosting with recombinant vaccinia virus.&lt;ref name=Sedegah2000 /&gt; An effective prime-boost strategy for the [[simian]] malarial model ''P. knowlesi'' has also been demonstrated.&lt;ref name=Rogers2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers WO, Baird JK, Kumar A, Tine JA, Weiss W, Aguiar JC, Gowda K, Gwadz R, Kumar S, Gold M, Hoffman SL | title = Multistage multiantigen heterologous prime boost vaccine for Plasmodium knowlesi malaria provides partial protection in rhesus macaques | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 69 | issue = 9 | pages = 5565–72 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11500430 | pmc = 98670 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.69.9.5565-5572.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhesus monkeys]] were primed with a multicomponent, multistage DNA vaccine encoding two liver-stage antigens – the circumsporozoite surface protein (PkCSP) and sporozoite surface protein 2 (PkSSP2) – and two blood stage antigens – the apical merozoite surface protein 1 (PkAMA1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (PkMSP1p42). They were then boosted with a recombinant canarypox virus encoding all four antigens (ALVAC-4). Immunized monkeys developed antibodies against sporozoites and infected erythrocytes, and IFN-γ-secreting T-cell responses against peptides from PkCSP. Partial protection against sporozoite challenge was achieved, and mean parasitemia was significantly reduced, compared to control monkeys. These models, while not ideal for extrapolation to ''P. falciparum'' in humans, will be important in pre-clinical trials.

=== Enhancing immune responses ===

==== DNA ====

The efficiency of DNA immunization can be improved by stabilising DNA against degradation, and increasing the efficiency of delivery of DNA into [[antigen-presenting cell]]s.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; This has been demonstrated by coating biodegradable cationic microparticles (such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) formulated with [[Cetrimonium bromide|cetyltrimethylammonium bromide]]) with DNA. Such DNA-coated microparticles can be as effective at raising CTL as recombinant viruses, especially when mixed with alum. Particles 300&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter appear to be most efficient for uptake by antigen presenting cells.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;

==== Alphavirus vectors ====

Recombinant alphavirus-based vectors have been used to improve DNA vaccination efficiency.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; The gene encoding the antigen of interest is inserted into the alphavirus replicon, replacing structural genes but leaving non-structural replicase genes intact. The [[Sindbis virus]] and [[Semliki Forest virus]] have been used to build recombinant [[alphavirus]] [[Replicon (genetics)|replicons]]. Unlike conventional DNA vaccinations alphavirus vectors kill transfected cells and are only transiently expressed. Alphavirus replicase genes are expressed in addition to the vaccine insert. It is not clear how alphavirus replicons raise an immune response, but it may be due to the high levels of protein expressed by this vector, replicon-induced cytokine responses, or replicon-induced apoptosis leading to enhanced antigen uptake by dendritic cells.

'''Southern Schleswig''' ({{lang-de|Südschleswig}} or ''{{lang|de|Landesteil Schleswig}}'', {{lang-da|Sydslesvig}}) is the southern half of the former [[Duchy of Schleswig]]&lt;ref&gt;Kathrin Sinner: Schleswig-Holstein - das nördliche Bundesland: Räumliche Verortung als kulturelles Identitäskonstruk, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany on the [[Jutland Peninsula]]. The geographical area today covers the large area between the [[Eider (river)|Eider]] river in the south and the [[Flensburg Fjord]] in the north,&lt;ref&gt;Sønderjylland A-Å, Aabenraa 2011, page 364&lt;/ref&gt; where it borders [[Denmark]]. Northern Schleswig, congruent with the former [[South Jutland County]], forms the southernmost part of Denmark. The area belonged to the [[Denmark|Crown of Denmark]] until Prussia and Austria declared war on Denmark in 1864. Denmark wanted to give away the German-speaking [[Holstein|Holsten]] and set the new border at the small river [[Ejderen]]. Prussian chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] concluded that this justified a war, and even proclaimed it a &quot;holy war&quot;. He also turned to the [[Emperor of Austria]], [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] for help. A similar war in 1848 had gone poorly for the Prussians. With Prussia's modern weapons and the help from both the Austrians and General [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Moltke]], the Danish army was destroyed or forced to make a disorderly retreat. And the Prussian-Danish border was moved from the [[Elbe]] up in [[Jutland]] to the creek ''{{lang|da|Kongeåen}}''.

After the [[First World War]], two referendums decided a new border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/genforeningen-1920/|title=Vis|first=|last=103982@au.dk|date=13 April 2018|website=danmarkshistorien.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;German, Troels Fink: &quot;Geschichte des schleswigschen Grenzlandes&quot; Publisher: Munksgaard, Copenhagen 1958, pages 178-192.&lt;/ref&gt;
The northern part reverted to Denmark as ''{{lang|da|Nordslesvig}}'' (North Slesvig). But the middle and southern part, including Schleswig's only city, [[Flensburg]], remained in what, since the [[unification of Germany]], had become German hands. In Denmark, the loss of ''{{lang|da|Flensborg}}'' caused a political crisis, ''{{lang|da|Påskekrisen}}'' or the Easter Crisis, as it happened during the Easter of 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.historiefaget.dk/emner/1920erne-1930erne/paaskekrisen-1920/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507194406/http://www.historiefaget.dk/emner/1920erne-1930erne/paaskekrisen-1920/# |archive-date=2016-05-07 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1849-1945/P%C3%A5skekrisen_1920|title=Påskekrisen 1920 - Gyldendal - Den Store Danske|website=denstoredanske.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second World War]] the area remained as German territory and, with [[Holstein]], formed the new [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] as a part of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] ([[West Germany]]) in 1948.

==History==
The Schleswig lands north of the [[Eider (river)|Eider]] river and the [[Bay of Kiel]] had been a [[fief]] of the [[Denmark|Danish Crown]] since the Early Middle Ages. The southern [[Holstein]] region belonged to [[Francia]] and later to the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but it was held as an imperial fief by the Danish kings since the 1460 [[Treaty of Ribe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.region.de/index.php?id=162&amp;L=1%2Ftrainers.php%3Fid%3D%27__ Region Sønderjylland-Schleswig: ''Politische Entwicklungen im Mittelalter'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] was first brought to a head during the [[Revolutions of 1848]], when, from 1848 to 1851, revolting German-speaking [[National liberalism|National liberals]] backed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] fought for the separation of Schleswig and Holstein from Denmark in the [[First Schleswig War]]. Though the ''status quo ante bellum'' was restored, the conflict lingered on, and on 1 February 1864 Prussian and [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] troops crossed the Eider, sparking off the [[Second Schleswig War]], after which Denmark had to cede Schleswig and Holstein according to the [[Treaty of Vienna (1864)|Treaty of Vienna]]. After the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, victorious Prussia took control over all Schleswig and Holstein but was obliged by the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]] to hold a referendum in predominantly Danish-speaking Northern Schleswig, which it never did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.region.de/index.php?id=169&amp;L=0%252C%252C Region Sønderjylland-Schleswig: ''Nationale Entwicklung im 19. Jahrhundert'' {{in lang|de}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the German defeat in [[World War I]], the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] were decreed by the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]], in which the present-day German-Danish border was drawn. The border took effect on 15 June 1920, dividing Schleswig into a southern and northern part and leaving a considerable Danish and German minority on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vimu.info/general_04.jsp?id=mod_4_5&amp;lang=da&amp;u=general&amp;flash=true vimu - Det Virtuelle Museum: ''Genforening'' {{in lang|da}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vimu.info/general_04.jsp?id=mod_4_5&amp;lang=de&amp;u=general&amp;flash=true&amp;s= vimu - Das Virtuelle Museum: ''Volksabstimmung'' {{in lang|de}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern day==
Southern Schleswig is part of the German [[states of Germany|state]] (''{{lang|de|Bundesland}}'') of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], thus its denotation as ''{{lang|de|Landesteil Schleswig}}''. It does not, however, form an administrative entity, but instead consists of the [[districts of Germany|districts]] (''{{lang|de|Landkreise}}'') of [[Schleswig-Flensburg]], [[Nordfriesland]], the [[urban districts of Germany|urban district]] (''{{lang|de|Kreisfreie Stadt}}'') of [[Flensburg]] and the northern part of [[Rendsburg-Eckernförde]].

Besides Standard German, [[West Low German|Low Saxon]] dialects ([[Schleswigsch]]) are spoken, as well as [[Danish language|Danish]] (Standard Danish or South Schleswig Danish) and its [[South Jutlandic]] variant, plus [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.region.de/index.php?id=219&amp;L=0%252C%252C Region Sønderjylland-Schleswig: ''Sprachen und Dialekte südlich der Grenze''{{in lang|de}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Danish and North Frisian are official minority languages. Many of the inhabitants who speak only German and not Danish do not consider the region any different from the rest of Schleswig-Holstein. This notion is disputed by those defining themselves as [[Danes]], South Schleswigans or Schleswigans, particularly historians and people organised in the institutions of the [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig]], such as the [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]], a political party representing the Danish and North Frisian minorities in the [[Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein]] and excluded from the 5% [[Election threshold|electoral threshold]]. Many of the last names found in the region are very often of Scandinavian or Danish form, with the ''-sen'' endings like Petersen.

The major cities of Southern Schleswig are [[Flensburg]], [[Rendsburg]], the city of [[Schleswig (city)|Schleswig]], and [[Husum]].

'''County Donegal''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ʌ|n|ɪ|ˈ|ɡ|ɔː|l|,_|ˌ|d|ɒ|n|-|,_|ˈ|d|ʌ|n|ɪ|ɡ|ɔː|l|,_|ˈ|d|ɒ|n|-}} {{Respell|DUN|ig|AWL|,_|DON|-,_-|awl}}; {{lang-ga|Contae Dhún na nGall}})&lt;ref name=logainm&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.logainm.ie/en/100013 | title = Dún na nGall/Donegal | work = Placenames Database of Ireland (logainm.ie) | publisher = [[Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht|Government of Ireland – Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht]] and [[Dublin City University]] | access-date = 7 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[counties of Ireland|county]] of Ireland in the [[provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]]. It is named after the town of [[Donegal (town)|Donegal]] ({{lang|ga|Dún na nGall}}, meaning 'fort of the foreigners'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donegaltown.ie/|title=Donegal Town Website Donegal Town (Dún na nGall), Donegal|website=donegaltown.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the south of the county. It has also been known as County '''Tyrconnell''' ({{lang|ga|Tír Chonaill}}, meaning 'Land of [[Conall Gulban|Conall]]'), after the historic [[Tyrconnell|territory of the same name]], on which it was based. [[Donegal County Council]] is the [[local government in the Republic of Ireland|local council]] and [[Lifford]] the [[county town]].

The population was 159,192 at the 2016 census.&lt;ref name=cso2016/&gt;

==Geography and political subdivisions==
In terms of size and area, it is the largest county in [[Ulster]] and the fourth-largest county in all of [[Ireland]]. Uniquely, County Donegal shares a small border with only one other county in the [[Republic of Ireland]] – [[County Leitrim]]. The vast majority of its land border is shared with three counties of [[Northern Ireland]]: [[County Londonderry]], [[County Tyrone]] and [[County Fermanagh]]. This geographic isolation from the rest of the Republic has led to Donegal people maintaining a distinct cultural identity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.donegallibrary.ie/quicklinks/aboutdonegal/ |title=Donegal Library Services |publisher=Donegallibrary.ie |access-date=9 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020165335/http://www.donegallibrary.ie/quicklinks/aboutdonegal/ |archive-date=20 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used to market the county with the [[slogan]] &quot;Up here it's different&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;IE NW&quot;&gt;[http://www.irelandnorthwest.ie/?id=28 Ireland Northwest].&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Lifford]] is the [[county town]], [[Letterkenny]] is by far the largest town in the county with a population of just under 20,000. Letterkenny and the nearby city of [[Derry]] form the main economic axis of the northwest of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/16086 |title=Derry and Donegal Sinn Féin Councillors join forces to push North West tourism |publisher=Sinnfein.ie |date=16 February 2009 |access-date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, what became the City of Derry was officially part of County Donegal up until 1610.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brian Lacy 1983&quot;&gt;Brian Lacy (Editor), ''Archaeological Survey of County Donegal'', P. 1. [[Donegal County Council]], Lifford, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baronies===
[[File:Dún Lúiche Cró Nimhe 2017 09 05.jpg|thumb|Poison Glen (''Gleann Nimhe''), in North West Donegal]]

There are eight historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] in the county:
* [[Banagh]] 
* [[Boylagh]] 
* Inishowen East
* Inishowen West 
* [[Kilmacrennan]] 
* Raphoe North
* Raphoe South 
* Tirhugh

===Informal districts===
The county may be informally divided into a number of traditional districts. There are two [[Gaeltacht]] districts in the west: [[The Rosses]] ({{lang-ga|Na Rosa}}), centred on the town of [[Dungloe]] ({{lang-ga|An Clochán Liath}}), and [[Gweedore]] ({{lang-ga|Gaoth Dobhair}}). Another Gaeltacht district is located in the north-west: [[Cloughaneely]] ({{lang-ga|Cloich Chionnaola}}), centred on the town of [[Falcarragh]] ({{lang-ga|An Fál Carrach}}). The most northerly part of the island of Ireland is the location for three [[peninsula]]s: [[Inishowen]], [[Fanad]] and [[Rosguill]]. The main population centre of Inishowen, Ireland's largest peninsula, is [[Buncrana]]. In the east of the county lies the [[River Finn (County Donegal)|Finn Valley]] (centred on [[Ballybofey]]) and The Laggan district (not to be confused with the [[Lagan Valley]] in the south of [[County Antrim]]), which is centred on the town of [[Raphoe]].

According to the 1841 Census, County Donegal had a population of 296,000 people. As a result of famine and emigration, the population had reduced by 41,000 by 1851 and further reduced by 18,000 by 1861. By the time of the 1951 Census the population was only 44% of what it had been in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Patterson, Edward M| year=1962 |title=The County Donegal Railways | publisher=David and Charles | location= Dawlish| pages=9–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016}}, the county's population was 159,192.&lt;ref name=cso2016/&gt;

===Physical geography===
[[File:Donegal beaches (2579124526).jpg|thumb|Horse riding on Tramore Strand (also known as Rosapenna Strand) in [[Downings]]]]
[[File:SlieveLeague ToneMapped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Slieve League]] cliffs, the second tallest in Ireland]]
[[File:Glengesh Pass.jpg|thumb|left|Glengesh Pass, near [[Ardara, County Donegal|Ardara]]]]
[[File:Donegalmap.jpg|thumb|Map of County Donegal]]

The county is the most mountainous in [[Ulster]] consisting chiefly of two ranges of low mountains; the [[Derryveagh Mountains]] in the north and the [[Blue Stack Mountains]] in the south, with [[Errigal]] at {{convert|749|m|ft|0}} the highest peak. It has a deeply indented coastline forming natural [[sea lough]]s, of which both [[Lough Swilly]] and [[Lough Foyle]] are the most notable. The [[Slieve League]] cliffs are the sixth-highest sea cliffs in Europe, while [[Malin Head]] is the most northerly point on the island of Ireland.

The climate is temperate and dominated by the [[Gulf Stream]], with warm, damp summers and mild wet winters. Two permanently inhabited islands, [[Arranmore]] and [[Tory Island]], lie off the coast, along with a large number of islands with only transient inhabitants. Ireland's second longest river, the [[River Erne|Erne]], enters [[Donegal Bay]] near the town of [[Ballyshannon]]. The [[River Erne]], along with other Donegal waterways, has been dammed to produce [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power. The [[River Foyle]] separates part of County Donegal from parts of both counties [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]].

===Botany===
A survey of the macroscopic marine [[algae]] of County Donegal was published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, O. 2003. The marine macroalgae of County Donegal, Ireland. ''Bulletin of Irish biogeoghical Society.'' 27: 3 – 164&lt;/ref&gt; The survey was compiled using the algal records held in the [[herbarium|herbaria]] of the following institutions: the [[Ulster Museum]], [[Belfast]]; [[Trinity College, Dublin]]; [[NUI Galway]], and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London.
Records of flowering plants include ''[[Dactylorhiza purpurella]]'' (Stephenson and Stephenson) Soó.&lt;ref&gt;Ennis, T. 2014. The occurrence of ''Dactylorhiza purpurella'' (T.Stephenson and T.S.Stephenson) Soó ''Irish Naturalists' Journal.'' '''33''': 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoology===
The animals included in the county include the [[European badger]] (''Meles meles'' L.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleeman|first1=D. Paddy|last2=Davenport|first2=John|last3=Cussen|first3=Robert E.|last4=Hammond|first4=Robert F.|title=The small-bodied Badgers (Meles meles (L.)) of Rutland Island, Co. Donegal|journal=The Irish Naturalists' Journal|date=1 January 2009|volume=30|jstor=20764515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are habitats for the rare [[corn crake]] (''Crex crex'') in the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.habitas.org.uk/priority/species.asp?item=23  |title=Crex Crex Corncrake, Priority Species Northern Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible examples of fallacious defense arguments===
Authors have cited defense arguments in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O. J. Simpson murder trial]] as an example of this fallacy regarding the context in which the accused had been brought to court: crime scene blood matched [[O. J. Simpson|Simpson]]'s with characteristics shared by 1 in 400 people. The defense argued that a football stadium could be filled with [[Los Angeles|Angelenos]] matching the sample and that the figure of 1 in 400 was useless.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, B., &amp; Vignaux, G. A. (1995). '' Interpreting evidence: Evaluating forensic evidence in the courtroom. '' Chichester: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossmo, D. Kim (2009).

[[File:OJ_Simpson_case_frequency_tree.svg|thumb|Frequency tree of 100 000 battered American women showing the prosecutor's fallacy in OJ Simpson's murder trial]]
Also at the O. J. Simpson murder trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Simpson had been violent toward his wife, while the defense argued that there was only one woman murdered for every 2500 women who were subjected to spousal abuse, and that any history of Simpson being violent toward his wife was irrelevant to the trial. However, the reasoning behind the defense's calculation was fallacious. According to author [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], the correct probability requires the context — that Simpson's wife had not only been subjected to domestic violence, but rather subjected to domestic violence (by Simpson) ''and'' murdered (by someone) — to be taken into account. Gigerenzer writes &quot;the chances that a batterer actually murdered his partner, given that she has been killed, is about 8 in 9 or approximately 90%&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gigerenzer, G., Reckoning with Risk: Learning to Live with Uncertainty, Penguin, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; While most cases of spousal abuse do not end in murder, most cases of murder where there is a history of spousal abuse were murdered by their spouse.

== The Sally Clark case ==

[[Sally Clark]], a British woman, was accused in 1998 of having killed her first child at 11 weeks of age and then her second child at 8 weeks of age. The prosecution had [[expert witness]] [[Roy Meadow|Sir Roy Meadow]], a professor and consultant paediatrician,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://reporter.leeds.ac.uk/428/mead.htm |title=Resolution adopted by the Senate (21 October 1998) on the retirement of Professor Sir Roy Meadow| work=Reporter |publisher=[[University of Leeds]] |number=428 |date=30 November 1998 |access-date=2015-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416125642/http://reporter.leeds.ac.uk/428/mead.htm |archive-date=2016-04-16 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; testify that the probability of two children in the same family dying from [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]] is about 1 in 73 million. That was much less frequent than the actual rate measured in [[Epidemiology|historical data]] – Meadow estimated it from single-SIDS death data, and the assumption that the probability of such deaths should be [[uncorrelated]] between infants.&lt;ref&gt;The population-wide probability of a SIDS fatality was about 1 in 1,303; Meadow generated his 1-in-73 million estimate from the lesser probability of SIDS death in the Clark household, which had lower risk factors (e.g. non-smoking). In this sub-population he estimated the probability of a single death at 1 in 8,500. See: {{cite web

}}. Professor Ray Hill questioned even this first step (1/8,500 vs 1/1,300) in two ways: firstly, on the grounds that it was [[bias]]ed, excluding those factors that increased risk (especially that both children were boys) and (more importantly) because reductions in SIDS risk factors will proportionately reduce murder risk factors, so that the relative frequencies of [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy]] and SIDS will remain in the same ratio as in the general population: {{cite web |url= http://www.mrbartonmaths.com/resources/a%20level/s1/Beyond%20reasonable%20doubt.doc

Yes, we can agree that such factors make a natural death less likely – but those same characteristics also make murder less likely. |year= 2002 |title= Cot Death or Murder? – Weighing the Probabilities }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Meadow acknowledged that 1-in-73 million is not an impossibility, but argued that such accidents would happen &quot;once every hundred years&quot; and that, in a country of 15 million 2-child families, it is vastly more likely that the double-deaths are due to [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy]] than to such a rare accident. However, there is good reason to suppose that the likelihood of a death from SIDS in a family is significantly greater if a previous child has already died in these circumstances (a [[genetic predisposition]] to SIDS is likely to invalidate that assumed [[statistical independence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,4221973-102285,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711221623/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,4221973-102285,00.html |archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=Gene find casts doubt on double 'cot death' murders |work=[[The Observer]] |date=July 15, 2001 |first1=John|last1=Sweeney |first2=Bill|last2=Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;) making some families more susceptible to SIDS and the error an outcome of the [[ecological fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://understandinguncertainty.org/node/545#notes |title= Convicted on Statistics? |author= Vincent Scheurer |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood of two SIDS deaths in the same family cannot be soundly [[Estimation theory|estimated]] by squaring the likelihood of a single such death in all otherwise similar families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Multiple sudden infant deaths – coincidence or beyond coincidence? |url= http://www.cse.salford.ac.uk/staff/RHill/ppe_5601.pdf |first= R. |last= Hill |journal= Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology |year= 2004 |volume= 18 |page= 321 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2004.00560.x |issue= 5 |pmid= 15367318}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
1-in-73 million greatly underestimated the chance of two successive accidents, but, even if that assessment were accurate, the court seems to have missed the fact that the 1-in-73 million number meant nothing on its own. As an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' probability, it should have been weighed against the ''a priori'' probabilities of the alternatives. [[A priori and a posteriori|Given that]] two deaths had occurred, one of the following explanations must be true, and all of them are ''a priori'' extremely improbable:
# Two successive deaths in the same family, both by SIDS
# Double homicide (the prosecution's case)
# Other possibilities (including one homicide and one case of SIDS)

It's unclear whether an estimate of the probability for the second possibility was ever proposed during the trial, or whether the comparison of the first two probabilities was understood to be the key estimate to make in the statistical analysis assessing the prosecution's case against the case for innocence.

Mrs. Clark was convicted in 1999, resulting in a press release by the [[Royal Statistical Society]] which pointed out the mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rss.org.uk/uploadedfiles/documentlibrary/744.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110824151124/http://www.rss.org.uk/uploadedfiles/documentlibrary/744.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date= 24 August 2011 |title= Royal Statistical Society concerned by issues raised in Sally Clark case |date= 23 October 2001 |quote= Society does not tolerate doctors making serious clinical errors because it is widely understood that such errors could mean the difference between life and death. The case of R v. Sally Clark is one example of a medical expert witness making a serious statistical error, one which may have had a profound effect on the outcome of the case }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Ray Hill (Mathematics professor at [[University of Salford|Salford]]) attempted to accurately compare the chances of these two possible explanations; he concluded that successive accidents are between 4.5 and 9 times more likely than are successive murders, so that the '&quot;a priori&quot;' [[odds]] of Clark's guilt were between 4.5 to 1 and 9 to 1 against.&lt;ref&gt;The uncertainty in this range is mainly driven by uncertainty in the likelihood of [[Recidivism|killing a second child]], having killed a first, see: {{cite journal |title= Multiple sudden infant deaths – coincidence or beyond coincidence? |url= http://www.cse.salford.ac.uk/staff/RHill/ppe_5601.pdf |first= R. |last= Hill |journal= Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology |year= 2004 |volume= 18 |pages= 322–323 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2004.00560.x |issue= 5 |pmid= 15367318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After it was found that the forensic pathologist who had examined both babies had withheld [[exculpatory evidence]], a higher court later quashed Sally Clark's conviction, on 29 January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2003/1020.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Sally Clark was a practising solicitor before the conviction. After her three-year imprisonment she developed a number of serious psychiatric problems including serious alcohol dependency and died in 2007 from acute alcohol poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/mar/17/childrensservices.uknews |title=Sally Clark, mother wrongly convicted of killing her sons, found dead at home |newspaper=The Guardian |date=March 17, 2007 |accessdate=2008-09-25 | location=London | first=Thair | last=Shaikh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/7082411.stm |title=Alcohol killed mother Sally Clark |work=[[BBC News]] |date=7 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Longitude blue.svg|thumb|Longitude lines on the globe]]

The '''longitude rewards''' were the system of [[inducement prize contest|inducement prizes]] offered by the [[United Kingdom|British]] government for a simple and practical method for the precise determination of a ship's [[longitude]] at sea.  The rewards, established through an Act of Parliament (the [[Longitude Act]]) in 1714, were administered by the [[Board of Longitude]].

This was by no means the first reward to be offered to solve this problem. [[Philip II of Spain]] offered one in 1567, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] in 1598 offered 6,000 ducats and a pension,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Longitude and the Académie Royale|first1=J J |last1=O'Connor|first2=E F|last2= Robertson|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/PrintHT/Longitude1.html|year=1997|publisher=MacTutor History of Mathematics}}
&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the [[States General of the Netherlands]] offered 10,000 florins shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=The Life of Christian Huygens|first=A.E.|last=Bell|page=35|year=1950|publisher=Edward Arnold, London|url=https://archive.org/stream/christianhuygens029504mbp#page/n41}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1675 [[Robert Hooke]] wanted to apply for a £1,000 reward in England for his invention of a spring-regulated watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Man Who Knew Too Much|last=Inwood|first=Stephen|year=2002|publisher=Macmillan|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these large sums were never won, though several people were awarded smaller amounts for significant achievements.

==The longitude problem==
The measurement of longitude was a problem that came into sharp focus as people began making transoceanic voyages.
Determining [[latitude]] was relatively easy in that it could be found from the altitude of the sun at noon with the aid of a table giving the sun's [[declination#Sun|declination]] for the day.&lt;ref&gt;Latitude can also be determined in the Northern Hemisphere from the angle above the horizon of [[Polaris]], the northern [[pole star]]. However, since Polaris is not precisely at the pole, it can only estimate the latitude unless the precise time is known or many measurements are made over time. While many measurements can be made on land, this makes it impractical for determining latitude at sea.&lt;/ref&gt; For longitude, early ocean navigators had to rely on [[dead reckoning]], based on calculations of the vessel's heading and speed for a given time (much of which was based on intuition on the part of the master and/or navigator). This was inaccurate on long voyages out of sight of land, and these voyages sometimes ended in tragedy. An accurate determination of longitude was also necessary to determine the proper &quot;magnetic declination&quot;, that is, the difference between indicated magnetic north and true north, which can differ by up to 10 degrees in the important trade latitudes of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Finding an adequate solution to determining longitude at sea was therefore of paramount importance.

The Longitude Act only addressed the determination of longitude at sea.  Determining longitude reasonably accurately on land was, from the 17th century onwards, [[History of longitude#Galileo's proposal — Jovian moons|possible]] using the [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]] as an astronomical 'clock'.  The moons were easily observable on land, but numerous attempts to reliably observe them from the deck of a ship resulted in failure.  For details on other efforts towards determining the longitude, see [[History of longitude]].

The need for better navigational accuracy for increasingly longer oceanic voyages had been an issue explored by many European nations for centuries before the passing of the [[Longitude Act]] in England in 1714. Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands offered financial incentives for solutions to the problem of [[longitude]] as early as 1598.&lt;ref name=Andrewes_1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrewes|first1=William J.H.|title=Introduction|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing the problem of longitude fell, primarily, into three categories: terrestrial, celestial, and mechanical.&lt;ref name=Andrewes_1/&gt;  This included detailed atlases, lunar charts, and timekeeping mechanisms at sea. It is postulated by scholars that the economic gains and political power to be had in oceanic exploration, and not scientific and technological curiosity, is what resulted in the swift passing of the [[Longitude Act]] of 1714 and the largest and most famous reward, the Longitude Prize being offered.&lt;ref name=Knowles&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knowles|first1=Jeremy R|title=Opening Address at the Longitude Symposium|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishing the rewards==
In the early 1700s, a series of maritime disasters occurred, including the wrecking of a squadron of naval vessels on the [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707|Scilly Islands in 1707]].&lt;ref name=Stimson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stimson|first1=Alan|title=The Longitude Problem: The Navigator's Story|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=71–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, mathematician Thomas Axe decreed in his will that a £1,000 prize be awarded for promising research into finding “true longitude” and that annual sums be paid to scholars involved in making corrected world maps.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner|first1=A.J.|title=In the Wake of the Act, but Mainly Before|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=115–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1713, when the longitude proposal of [[William Whiston]] and [[Humphrey Ditton]] was presented at the opening of the session of Parliament, a general understanding of the longitude problem prompted the formation of a parliamentary committee and the swift passing of the Longitude Act on July 8, 1714.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; Within this act, is detailed three rewards based on levels of accuracy, which are the same accuracy requirements used for the Axe prize, set by Whiston and Ditton in their petition, and recommended by [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Edmund Halley]] to the parliamentary committee.&lt;ref name=Sobel_1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobel|first1=Dana|title=The Illustrated Longitude|date=1995|publisher=Walker and Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*£10,000 (equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|10000|1714|2015|r=0}}}} in 2015{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) for a method that could determine longitude within 1 [[Degree of arc|degree]] (equivalent to {{convert|60|nmi}} at the equator).  
*£15,000 (equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|15000|1714|2015|r=0}}}} in 2015{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) for a method that could determine longitude within 40 [[Minutes of arc|minutes]]  
*£20,000 (equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|20000|1714|2015|r=0}}}} in 2015{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) for a method that could determine longitude within 30 minutes 
 
In addition, rewards were on offer for those who could produce a method that worked within 80 geographical miles of the coast (where ships would be in most danger), and for those with promising ideas who needed financial help to bring them to trial.

Proposed methods would be tested by sailing through the ocean, from Britain to any port in West Indies (about six weeks) without losing its longitude beyond the limits listed above.  Also, the contender would be required to demonstrate the accuracy of their method by determining the longitude of a specific land based feature whose longitude was already accurately known.  The parliamentary committee also established the [[Board of Longitude]]. This panel of adjudicators would review proposed solutions and were also given authority to grant up to £2,000 in advances for promising projects that did not entirely fulfill the terms of the prize levels, but that were still found worthy of encouragement.&lt;ref name=Stimson/&gt; The exact terms of the requirements for the prizes would later be contended by several recipients, including John Harrison. Ultimately, the £20,000 reward was not awarded to anyone in a lump sum, although [[John Harrison]] did receive a series of payments totaling £23,065.&lt;ref name=Andrewes_2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrewes|first1=William J.H.|title=Even Newton Could Be Wrong: The Story of Harrison’s First Three Sea Clocks|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=189–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Board of Longitude]] remained in existence for more than 100 years. When it was officially disbanded in 1828, an excess of £100,000 had been disbursed.&lt;ref name=Sobel_1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howse|first1=Derek|title=Britain's Board of Longitude: The Finances|url=http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/03/howse.pdf|publisher=Mariner's Mirror (1998)|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable recipients==
The Longitude Act offered a very large incentive for solutions to the longitude problem. Some later recipients of rewards, such as Euler and Mayer, made clear publicly that the money was not the incentive, but instead the important improvements to navigation and cartography. Other recipients, such as Kendall and Harrison had to appeal to the Board of Longitude and other governmental officials for adequate compensation for their work. Still others submitted radical and impractical theories, some of which can be seen in a collection at Harvard’s [[Houghton Library]].&lt;ref name=Gingerich&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gingerich|first1=Owen|title=Cranks and opportunists: &quot;Nutty&quot; solutions to the longitude problem|journal=The Quest for Longitude: The Proceedings of the Longitude Symposium|date=1996|pages=134–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schemes and ideas for improvements to instruments and astronomy, both practical and impractical, can be seen among the digitised archives of the Board of Longitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Papers of the Board of Longitude&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Papers of the Board of Longitude|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/rgo14|website=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Board of Longitude did not award £20,000 at one time, they did offer sums to various individuals in recognition of their work for improvements in instrumentation or in published atlases and star charts.

==John Harrison's contested reward==

The winner of the most reward money under the Longitude Act is [[John Harrison]] for sea timekeepers, including his H4 [[marine chronometer|sea watch]]. Harrison was 21 years old when the Longitude Act was passed. He spent the next 45 years perfecting the design of his timekeepers. He first received a reward from the Commissioners of Longitude in 1737 and did not receive his final payment until he was 80.&lt;ref name=Quill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quill|first1=Humphrey|title=John Harrison: The Man who found Longitude|date=1966|publisher=John Baker Publishers|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison was first awarded £250 in 1737, in order to improve on his promising H1 sea clock, leading to the construction of H2. £2,000 was rewarded over the span of 1741–1755 for continued construction and completion of H2 and H3. From 1760 to 1765, Harrison received £2,865 for various expenses related to the construction, ocean trials, and eventual award for the performance of his sea watch H4.&lt;ref name=Sobel_1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=Richard|last2=Higgitt|first2=Rebekah|title=Finding longitude: how clocks and stars helped solve the longitude problem|date=2014|publisher=Collins|location=Glasgow|isbn=9780007525867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite
the performance of the H4 exceeding the accuracy requirement of the highest reward possible in the original [[Longitude Act]], Harrison was rewarded £7,500 (that is, £10,000 minus payments he had received in 1762 and 1764) once he had revealed the method of making his device, and was told that he must show that his single machine could be replicated before the final £10,000 could be paid.&lt;ref name=Andrewes_2/&gt;

Harrison made one rather than the requested two further copies of H4, and he and his family members eventually appealed to [[King George III]] after petitions for further rewards were not answered by the [[Board of Longitude]].&lt;ref name=Quill/&gt; A reward of £8,750 was granted by Parliament in 1773 for a total payment of £23,065 spanning thirty-six years.&lt;ref name=Andrewes_2/&gt;

[https://books.google.com/books?id=hP7jJAkTd9MC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=Leonid+Ilyich+Brezhnev+10+november+1982&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIwtafmp3WAhXya5oKHS1NDk8Q6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Leonid%20Ilyich%20Brezhnev%2010%20november%201982&amp;f=false Profile of Leonid Brezhnev]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] politician who led the Soviet Union as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the governing [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] (1964–1982) and as [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] (1977–1982). His 18-year term as general secretary was second only to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s in duration. While Brezhnev's rule was characterised by political stability and notable foreign policy successes, it was also marked by corruption, inefficiency, economic stagnation, and rapidly growing technological gaps with the West.

Brezhnev was born into a Russian working-class family in [[Kamianske|Kamenskoye]], [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]]. Upon the Soviet Union's formation in the aftermath of the 1917 [[October Revolution]], Brezhnev joined the Communist party's youth league in 1923. He became an official party member in 1929. When [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941]], he joined the [[Red Army]] as a [[political commissar|commissar]] and rose rapidly through the ranks to become a [[major general]] during [[World War II]]. Brezhnev was promoted to the Central Committee in 1952 and became a full member of the [[Politburo]] in 1957. In 1964 he ousted [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and took over as First Secretary of the CPSU, the most powerful position in the Kremlin.

Brezhnev's conservative, pragmatic approach to leadership significantly stabilised the position of the Soviet Union and its ruling party. Whereas Khrushchev regularly enacted policies without consulting the rest of the Politburo, Brezhnev was careful to minimise dissent among the Party membership by reaching decisions through consensus. Additionally, while pushing for détente between the two Cold War superpowers, he achieved Soviet nuclear parity with the United States and legitimised his country's hegemony over Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the massive arms buildup and widespread military interventionism under Brezhnev's regime significantly expanded the Soviet Union's global influence (particularly in the Middle East and Africa).

Conversely, Brezhnev's hostility to political reform ushered in an era of societal decline known as the [[Era of Stagnation|Brezhnev Stagnation]]. In addition to pervasive corruption and falling economic growth, this period was characterised by an increasing technological gap between the Soviet Union and the United States. Upon coming to power in 1985, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] denounced Brezhnev's government for its pervasive inefficiency and inflexibility before [[perestroika|implementing policies]] to [[liberalisation|liberalise]] the Soviet Union.

After 1975, Brezhnev's health rapidly deteriorated and he increasingly withdrew from international affairs. Following years of declining health, [[Death and state funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|he died]] on 10 November 1982 and was succeeded as general secretary by [[Yuri Andropov]].

==Early life and career==
===Origins (1906–1939)===
[[File:Л. И. Брежнев с женой Викторией, 1927 год.jpg|thumb|upright=0.79545|left|Young Brezhnev with his wife [[Viktoria Brezhneva|Viktoria]]]]

Brezhnev was born on 19 December 1906 in [[Kamianske|Kamenskoye]], [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now Kamianske, [[Ukraine]]), to [[metalworker]] Ilya Yakovlevich Brezhnev and his wife, Natalia Denisovna Mazalova. His parents lived in Brezhnevo ([[Kursky District, Kursk Oblast]], Russia) before moving to Kamenskoe. Brezhnev's ethnicity was given as [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] in some documents, including his passport,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/a/ac/Brezhnev_LI_ListKadr_1942.jpg|title=Wikimedia commons: L.I. Brezhnev military card}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Brezhnev_LI_OrKrZn_NagrList_1942.jpg?uselang=ru|title=File:Brezhnev LI OrKrZn NagrList 1942.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Brezhnev_LI_Pasport_1947.jpg?uselang=en|title=File:Brezhnev LI Pasport 1947.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russian in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Brezhnev_LI_OrOtVo_NagrList_1943.jpg?uselang=en|title=File:Brezhnev LI OrOtVo NagrList 1943.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=6}}

Like many youths in the years after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], he received a [[vocational education|technical education]], at first in [[land management]] and then in [[metallurgy]]. He graduated from the Kamenskoye Metallurgical [[Tekhnikum|Technicum]] in 1935{{sfn|McCauley|1997|p=47}} and became a [[metallurgical engineer]] in the iron and steel industries of eastern Ukraine.

Brezhnev joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] youth organisation, the [[Komsomol]], in 1923, and the Party itself in 1929 {{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=6}} From 1935 to 1936 he completed the compulsory term of military service. After taking courses at a tank school, he served as a [[political commissar]] in a tank factory.

During Stalin's [[Great Purge]], Brezhnev was one of many ambitious apparatchiks who exploited the resulting openings in the government and the party to advance rapidly in the regime's ranks.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=6}} In 1936, he became director of the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum (a technical college) and was transferred to the regional center of [[Dnipropetrovsk]]. Later in 1939 he became Party Secretary in Dnipropetrovsk,{{sfn|McCauley|1997|p=47}} in charge of the city's defence industries. Here, he took the first steps toward building a network of supporters which came to be known as the &quot;Dnipropetrovsk Mafia&quot; that would greatly aid his rise to power.

===World War II (1941–1945)===
[[File:Brezhnev 1942.jpg|thumb|240px|Brigade commissar Brezhnev (right) presents a Communist Party membership card to a soldier on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in 1943.]]

When [[Nazi Germany]] [[Eastern Front (World War II)|invaded the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, Brezhnev was, like most middle-ranking Party officials, immediately drafted. He worked to evacuate Dnipropetrovsk's industries before the city fell to the Germans on 26 August, and then was assigned as a [[political commissar]]. In October Brezhnev was made deputy of political administration for the [[Soviet Southern Front|Southern Front]], with the rank of Brigade-Commissar (Colonel).{{sfn|Green|Reeves|1993|p=192}}

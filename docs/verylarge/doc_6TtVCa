In September 1946, Holiday began her only major film, ''[[New Orleans (1947 film)|New Orleans]]'', in which she starred opposite Louis Armstrong and [[Woody Herman]]. Plagued by racism and [[McCarthyism]], producer [[Jules Levey]] and script writer [[Herbert Biberman]] were pressed to lessen Holiday's and Armstrong's roles to avoid the impression that black people created jazz. The attempts failed because in 1947 Biberman was listed as one of the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] and sent to jail.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, pp. 152–155.&lt;/ref&gt; Several scenes were deleted from the film. &quot;They had taken miles of footage of music and scenes,&quot; Holiday said, but &quot;none of it was left in the picture. And very damn little of me. I know I wore a white dress for a number I did... and that was cut out of the picture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Lady Sings the Blues'', pp. 136–140.&lt;/ref&gt; She recorded &quot;The Blues Are Brewin'&quot; for the film's soundtrack. Other songs included in the movie are &quot;[[Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?]]&quot; and &quot;Farewell to Storyville&quot;. Holiday's drug addictions were a problem on the set. She earned more than one thousand dollars per week from club ventures but spent most of it on [[heroin]]. Her lover, [[Joe Guy (musician)|Joe Guy]], traveled to Hollywood while Holiday was filming and supplied her with drugs. Guy was banned from the set when he was found there by Holiday's manager, Joe Glaser.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, pp. 152–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1940s, Holiday had begun recording a number of slow, sentimental ballads. ''[[Metronome (magazine)|Metronome]]'' expressed its concerns in 1946 about &quot;Good Morning Heartache&quot;, saying, &quot;there's a danger that Billie's present formula will wear thin, but up to now it's wearing well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson, p. 113&quot;/&gt; The ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' reported of a concert in 1946 that her performance had little variation in melody and no change in tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1947, Holiday was at her commercial peak, having made $250,000 in the three previous years.&lt;ref&gt;''Lady Sings the Blues'', pp. 147–149.&lt;/ref&gt; She was ranked second in the ''[[DownBeat]]'' poll for 1946 and 1947, her highest ranking in that poll.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; She was ranked fifth in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' 's annual college poll of &quot;girl singers&quot; on July 6, 1947 ([[Jo Stafford]] was first). In 1946, Holiday won the ''Metronome'' magazine popularity poll.&lt;ref&gt;Chilton, John (1975). ''Billie's Blues: The Billie Holiday Story, 1933–1959''. Part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 1947, Holiday was arrested for possession of [[narcotic]]s in her New York apartment. On May 27 she was in court. &quot;It was called 'The United States of America versus Billie Holiday'. And that's just the way it felt,&quot; she recalled.&lt;ref&gt;''Lady Sings the Blues'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, she heard that her lawyer would not come to the trial to represent her. &quot;In plain English that meant no one in the world was interested in looking out for me,&quot; she said. Dehydrated and unable to hold down food, she pleaded guilty and asked to be sent to the hospital. The [[district attorney]] spoke in her defense, saying, &quot;If your honor please, this is a case of a drug addict, but more serious, however, than most of our cases, Miss Holiday is a professional entertainer and among the higher rank as far as income was concerned.&quot; She was sentenced to [[Federal Prison Camp, Alderson|Alderson Federal Prison Camp]] in West Virginia. The drug possession conviction caused her to lose her [[New York City Cabaret Card]], preventing her working anywhere that sold alcohol; thereafter, she performed in concert venues and theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Lahr, John.[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n24/john-lahr/her-haunted-heart ''Her Haunted Heart''].

Holiday was released early (on March 16, 1948) because of good behavior. When she arrived at [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], her pianist [[Bobby Tucker]] and her dog Mister were waiting. The dog leaped at Holiday, knocking off her hat, and tackling her to the ground. &quot;He began lapping me and loving me like crazy,&quot; she said. A woman thought the dog was attacking Holiday. She screamed, a crowd gathered, and reporters arrived. &quot;I might just as well have wheeled into [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Penn Station]] and had a quiet little get-together with the [[Associated Press]], [[United Press]], and [[International News Service]],&quot; she said.&lt;ref&gt;''Lady Sings the Blues'', p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Fishman (who fought with Joe Glaser to be Holiday's manager) thought of a comeback concert at Carnegie Hall. Holiday hesitated, unsure audiences would accept her after the arrest. She gave in and agreed to appear. On March 27, 1948, Holiday played Carnegie Hall to a sold-out crowd. 2,700 tickets were sold in advance, a record at the time for the venue. Her popularity was unusual because she didn't have a current hit record.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, pp. 165–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Her last record to reach the charts was &quot;Lover Man&quot; in 1945. Holiday sang 32 songs at the Carnegie concert by her count, including [[Cole Porter]]'s &quot;[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]&quot; and her 1930s hit, &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;. During the show, someone sent her a box of [[gardenia]]s. &quot;My old trademark,&quot; Holiday said. &quot;I took them out of box and fastened them smack to the side of my head without even looking twice.&quot; There was a hatpin in the gardenias and Holiday unknowingly stuck it into the side of her head. &quot;I didn't feel anything until the blood started rushing down in my eyes and ears,&quot; she said. After the third curtain call, she passed out.&lt;ref&gt;''Lady Sings the Blues'' pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 1948, Bob Sylvester and her promoter Al Wilde arranged a Broadway show for her. Titled ''Holiday on Broadway'', it sold out. &quot;The regular music critics and drama critics came and treated us like we were legit,&quot; she said. But it closed after three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;''Lady Sings the Blues'', pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holiday was arrested again on January 22, 1949, in her room at the Hotel Mark Twain in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Travel Picks: Top 10 famous hotel rooms | editor1-first=Miral | editor1-last=Fahmy | work=Reuters | date=July 4, 2008 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-travel-picks-rooms/travel-picks-top-10-famous-hotel-rooms-idUSSP29329220080704 | access-date=January 29, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holiday said she began using hard drugs in the early 1940s. She married trombonist Jimmy Monroe on August 25, 1941. While still married, she became involved with trumpeter Joe Guy, her drug dealer. She divorced Monroe in 1947 and also split with Guy.

[[File:Billie Holiday LAT.jpg|thumb|Holiday in court over a contract dispute, late 1949]]
In October 1949, Holiday recorded &quot;[[Crazy He Calls Me]]&quot;, which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2010. Gabler said the hit was her most successful recording for Decca after &quot;Lover Man&quot;. The charts of the 1940s did not list songs outside the top 30, making it impossible to recognize minor hits. By the late 1940s, despite her popularity and concert power, her singles were little played on radio, perhaps because of her reputation.{{sfn|Clarke|2000|p=327}}

The loss of her cabaret card reduced Holiday's earnings. She had not received proper record royalties until she joined Decca, so her main revenue was club concerts. The problem worsened when Holiday's records went out of print in the 1950s. She seldom received royalties in her later years. In 1958, she received a royalty of only $11.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Her lawyer in the late 1950s, Earle Warren Zaidins, registered with [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] only two songs she had written or co-written, costing her revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Holiday played at the Ebony Club, which was against the law. Her manager, John Levy, was convinced he could get her card back and allowed her to open without one. &quot;I opened scared,&quot; Holiday said, &quot;[I was] expecting the cops to come in any chorus and carry me off. But nothing happened. I was a huge success.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holiday recorded Gershwin's &quot;[[I Loves You, Porgy]]&quot; in 1948. In 1950, Holiday appeared in the [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] short film ''[[Sugar Chile Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet]]'', singing &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; and &quot;Now, Baby or Never&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1952–59: ''Lady Sings the Blues''===
By the 1950s, Holiday's drug abuse, drinking, and relationships with abusive men caused her health to deteriorate. She appeared on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[reality television|reality series]] ''The Comeback Story'' to discuss attempts to overcome her misfortunes. Her later recordings showed the effects of declining health on her voice, as it grew coarse and no longer projected its former vibrancy.{{dubious|date=August 2019}}

Holiday first toured Europe in 1954 as part of a [[Leonard Feather]] package. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[impresario]], Nils Hellstrom, initiated the &quot;Jazz Club U.S.A.&quot; (after the Leonard Feather radio show) tour starting in [[Stockholm]] in January 1954 and then Germany, Netherlands, Paris and Switzerland. The tour party was Holiday, [[Buddy DeFranco]], [[Red Norvo]], Carl Drinkard, Elaine Leighton, [[Sonny Clark]], Berryl Booker, [[Jimmy Raney]], and [[Red Mitchell]]. A recording of a live set in Germany was released as ''Lady Love – Billie Holiday''.&lt;ref&gt;Record notes, ''Lady Love – Billie Holiday'', [[United Artists Records]], UAL 8073; notes by [[Leonard Feather]] and [[LeRoi Jones]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Holiday's autobiography, ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (book)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', was ghostwritten by [[William Dufty]] and published in 1956. Dufty, a ''[[New York Post]]'' writer and editor then married to Holiday's close friend Maely Dufty, wrote the book quickly from a series of conversations with the singer in the Duftys' 93rd Street apartment. He also drew on the work of earlier interviewers and intended to let Holiday tell her story in her own way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle&quot; /&gt; In his 2015 study, ''Billie Holiday: The Musician and the Myth'', [[John Szwed]] argued that ''Lady Sings the Blues'' is a generally accurate account of her life, but that co-writer Dufty was forced to water down or suppress material by the threat of legal action. According to the reviewer [[Richard Brody]], &quot;Szwed traces the stories of two important relationships that are missing from the book—with [[Charles Laughton]], in the 1930s, and with [[Tallulah Bankhead]], in the late 1940s—and of one relationship that's sharply diminished in the book, her affair with [[Orson Welles]] around the time of ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Brody, Richard |author-link=Richard Brody |title=The Art of Billie Holiday's Life |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-art-of-billie-holidays-life |access-date=April 6, 2015 |work=The New Yorker |date=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accompany her autobiography, Holiday released the LP ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (Billie Holiday album)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' in June 1956. The album featured four new tracks, &quot;[[Lady Sings the Blues (song)|Lady Sings the Blues]]&quot;, &quot;[[Too Marvelous for Words]]&quot;, &quot;[[Willow Weep for Me]]&quot;, and &quot;[[I Thought About You]]&quot;, and eight new recordings of her biggest hits to date.

On November 10, 1956, Holiday performed two concerts before packed audiences at Carnegie Hall. Live recordings of the second Carnegie Hall concert were released on a Verve/HMV album in the UK in late 1961 called ''[[The Essential Billie Holiday: Carnegie Hall Concert Recorded Live|The Essential Billie Holiday]]''. The 13 tracks included on this album featured her own songs &quot;[[Billie's Blues|I Love My Man]]&quot;, &quot;[[Don't Explain (song)|Don't Explain]]&quot; and &quot;[[Fine and Mellow (song)|Fine and Mellow]]&quot;, together with other songs closely associated with her, including &quot;[[Body and Soul (1930 song)|Body and Soul]]&quot;, &quot;[[My Man]]&quot;, and &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; (her lyrics accompanied a tune by pianist [[Herbie Nichols]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicadesdelasantipodas.blogspot.com/2009/11/billie-holiday-1956-at-carnegie-hall.html Billie Holiday: 1956 at the Carnegie Hall.

Interspersed among Holiday's songs, Millstein read aloud four lengthy passages from her autobiography, ''Lady Sings the Blues''. He later wrote:

{{quote|The narration began with the ironic account of her birth in Baltimore – 'Mom and Pop were just a couple of kids when they got married. He was eighteen, she was sixteen, and I was three' – and ended, very nearly shyly, with her hope for love and a long life with 'my man' at her side. It was evident, even then, that Miss Holiday was ill. I had known her casually over the years and I was shocked at her physical weakness. Her rehearsal had been desultory; her voice sounded tinny and trailed off; her body sagged tiredly. But I will not forget the metamorphosis that night. The lights went down, the musicians began to play and the narration began. Miss Holiday stepped from between the curtains, into the white spotlight awaiting her, wearing a white evening gown and white gardenias in her black hair. She was erect and beautiful; poised and smiling. And when the first section of narration was ended, she sang – with strength undiminished – with all of the art that was hers. I was very much moved. In the darkness, my face burned and my eyes. I recall only one thing. I smiled.&quot;&lt;ref name=Millstein /&gt;}}

The critic [[Nat Hentoff]] of ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine, who attended the Carnegie Hall concert, wrote the remainder of the sleeve notes on the 1961 album. He wrote of Holiday's performance:

{{quote|Throughout the night, Billie was in superior form to what had sometimes been the case in the last years of her life. Not only was there assurance of phrasing and intonation; but there was also an outgoing warmth, a palpable eagerness to reach and touch the audience. And there was mocking wit. A smile was often lightly evident on her lips and her eyes as if, for once, she could accept the fact that there were people who did dig her. The beat flowed in her uniquely sinuous, supple way of moving the story along; the words became her own experiences; and coursing through it all was Lady's sound – a texture simultaneously steel-edged and yet soft inside; a voice that was almost unbearably wise in disillusion and yet still childlike, again at the centre. The audience was hers from before she sang, greeting her and saying good-bye with heavy, loving applause. And at one time, the musicians too applauded. It was a night when Billie was on top, undeniably the best and most honest jazz singer alive.}}

Her performance of &quot;Fine and Mellow&quot; on [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Sound of Jazz]]'' program is memorable for her interplay with her long-time friend [[Lester Young]]. Both were less than two years from death. Young died in March 1959. Holiday wanted to sing at his funeral, but her request was denied.

When Holiday returned to Europe almost five years later, in 1959, she made one of her last television appearances for Granada's ''Chelsea at Nine'' in London. Her final studio recordings were made for [[MGM Records]] in 1959, with lush backing from [[Ray Ellis]] and his Orchestra, who had also accompanied her on the Columbia album ''[[Lady in Satin]]'' the previous year (see below). The MGM sessions were released posthumously on a self-titled album, later retitled and re-released as ''[[Last Recording]]''.

On March 28, 1957, Holiday married Louis McKay, a [[Organized crime|mob]] enforcer. McKay, like most of the men in her life, was abusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robertfulford.com/2005-05-17-holiday.html |title=Trying to Find the Real Lady Day: Those Who Try to Tell Billie Holiday's Story Often Discover an Unknowable Life |first=Robert |last=Fulford |publisher=Robertfulford.com |date=May 17, 2005 |access-date=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were separated at the time of her death, but McKay had plans to start a chain of Billie Holiday vocal studios, on the model of the [[Arthur Murray]] dance schools. Holiday was childless, but she had two godchildren: singer [[Lorraine Feather|Billie Lorraine Feather]] (the daughter of Leonard Feather) and [[Bevan Dufty]] (the son of [[William Dufty]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamlin |first=Jesse |title=Billie Holiday's Bio, 'Lady Sings the Blues,' May Be Full of Lies, but It Gets at Jazz Great's Core |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=September 18, 2006 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/09/18/DDG2VL68691.DTL |access-date=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
By early 1959, Holiday was diagnosed with [[cirrhosis]]. Although she had initially stopped drinking on her doctor's orders, it was not long before she relapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feather |first=Leonard |title=From Satchmo to Miles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7NUtAEACAA |year=1987 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-80302-4 |page=82}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1959, she had lost {{convert|20|lb|kg}}.

The [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]], under the order of [[Harry J.

Gilbert Millstein of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who was the announcer at Holiday's 1956 Carnegie Hall concerts and wrote parts of the sleeve notes for the album ''The Essential Billie Holiday'' (see above), described her death in these sleeve notes, dated 1961:

{{quote|Billie Holiday died in Metropolitan Hospital, New York, on Friday, July 17, 1959, in the bed in which she had been arrested for illegal possession of narcotics a little more than a month before, as she lay mortally ill; in the room from which a police guard had been removed – by court order – only a few hours before her death, which, like her life, was disorderly and pitiful. She had been strikingly beautiful, but she was wasted physically to a small, grotesque caricature of herself. The worms of every kind of excess – drugs were only one – had eaten her. The likelihood exists that among the last thoughts of this cynical, sentimental, profane, generous and greatly talented woman of 44 was the belief that she was to be arraigned the following morning. She would have been, eventually, although possibly not that quickly. In any case, she removed herself finally from the jurisdiction of any court here below.&lt;ref name=Millstein&gt;{{cite liner notes |last1=Millstein |first1=Gilbert |type=liner notes |title=[[The Essential Billie Holiday: Carnegie Hall Concert Recorded Live|The Essential Billie Holiday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}When Holiday died, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a short obituary on page 15 without a byline. She left an estate of $1,000, and her best recordings from the '30s were mostly out of print. Holiday's public stature grew in the following years. In 1961, she was voted to the Down Beat Hall Of Fame, and soon after Columbia reissued nearly one hundred of her early records. In 1972, Diana Ross' portrayal of Holiday in ''Lady Sings the Blues'' was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe. Holiday was posthumously nominated for 23 Grammy awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McDonough |first=John |date=April 7, 2015 |title=Billie Holiday: A Singer Beyond Our Understanding |newspaper=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/04/07/397877385/billie-holiday-a-singer-beyond-our-understanding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocal style and range==
Holiday's delivery made her performances recognizable throughout her career. Her improvisation compensated for lack of musical education. Holiday said that she always wanted her voice to sound like an instrument and some of her influences were [[Louis Armstrong]] and the singer [[Bessie Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Billie Holiday&quot;. New York Jazz Museum, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}} Her last major recording, a 1958 album entitled ''[[Lady in Satin]]'', features the backing of a 40-piece orchestra conducted and arranged by [[Ray Ellis]], who said of the album in 1997:

{{quote|I would say that the most emotional moment was her listening to the playback of &quot;I'm a Fool to Want You.&quot; There were tears in her eyes&amp;nbsp;... After we finished the album I went into the control room and listened to all the takes. I must admit I was unhappy with her performance, but I was just listening musically instead of emotionally. It wasn't until I heard the final mix a few weeks later that I realized how great her performance really was.&lt;ref&gt;Interview on KCSM&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Frank Sinatra]] was influenced by her performances on [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] as a young man. He told ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine in 1958 about her impact:

{{quote| With few exceptions, every major pop singer in the US during her generation has been touched in some way by her genius. It is Billie Holiday who was, and still remains, the greatest single musical influence on me. Lady Day is unquestionably the most important influence on American popular singing in the last twenty years.{{sfn|Clarke|2000|p=96}}}}

==Discography==
{{Main|Billie Holiday discography}}
Billie Holiday recorded extensively for four labels: [[Columbia Records]], which issued her recordings on its subsidiary labels [[Brunswick Records]], [[Vocalion Records]], and [[OKeh Records]], from 1933 through 1942; [[Commodore Records]] in 1939 and 1944; [[Decca Records]] from 1944 through 1950; briefly for [[Aladdin Records (US)|Aladdin Records]] in 1951; [[Verve Records]] and on its earlier imprint [[Clef Records]] from 1952 through 1957, then again for Columbia Records from 1957 to 1958 and finally for [[MGM Records]] in 1959. Many of Holiday's recordings appeared on [[phonograph record|78-rpm records]] prior to the [[LP record|long-playing vinyl record era]], and only Clef, Verve, and Columbia issued albums during her lifetime that were not compilations of previously released material. Many compilations have been issued since her death, as well as comprehensive [[box set]]s and live recordings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/LP_discography.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225224251/http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/LP_discography.htm|date=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p56716/discography/compilations|pure_url=yes}} Billie Holiday].

===Hit records===
In 1986, [[Joel Whitburn]]'s company Record Research compiled information on the popularity of recordings released from the era predating rock and roll and created pop charts dating back to the beginning of the commercial recording industry. The company's findings were published in the book ''Pop Memories 1890–1954''. Several of Holiday's records are listed on the pop charts Whitburn created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald, p. 74&quot;&gt;Donald, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holiday began her recording career on a high note with her first major release, &quot;Riffin' the Scotch&quot;, of which 5,000 copies were sold. It was released under the name &quot;Benny Goodman &amp; His Orchestra.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald, p. 74&quot;/&gt;

Most of Holiday's early successes were released under the name &quot;Teddy Wilson &amp; His Orchestra&quot;. During her stay in Wilson's band, Holiday would sing a few bars and then other musicians would have a solo. Wilson, one of the most influential jazz pianists of the swing era,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riverwalkjazz.org/jazznotes/educators_TeddyWilson/ JazzNotes for Educators: Teddy Wilson]. Riverwalkjazz.org. Retrieved on November 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; accompanied Holiday more than any other musician. He and Holiday issued 95 recordings together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/the_musicians.htm#Wilson Billie Holiday Discography – Her Musicians] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831024022/http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/the_musicians.htm#Wilson |date=August 31, 2010 }}. Billieholidaysongs.com. Retrieved on November 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1936, Holiday began releasing sides under her own name. These songs were released under the band name &quot;Billie Holiday &amp; Her Orchestra&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/all_songs.htm#1936 Billie Holiday Studio Songs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528124535/http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/all_songs.htm#1936 |date=May 28, 2010 }}. Billieholidaysongs.com. Retrieved on November 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Most noteworthy, the popular jazz standard &quot;[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]&quot; sold well and was listed on the pop charts of the time at number 12, the first time the jazz standard charted. Only [[Billy Stewart]]'s R&amp;B version of &quot;Summertime&quot; reached a higher chart placement than Holiday's, charting at number 10 thirty years later in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tsort.info/music/b7senr.htm Song Title 70: Summertime]. Tsort.info. Retrieved on November 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holiday had 16 best-selling songs in 1937, making the year her most commercially successful. It was in this year that Holiday scored her sole number one hit as a featured vocalist on the available pop charts of the 1930s, &quot;Carelessly&quot;. The hit &quot;[[I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm]]&quot;, was also recorded by [[Ray Noble]], [[Glen Gray]] and [[Fred Astaire]], whose rendering was a bestseller for weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntl.matrix.com.br/pfilho/html/top1/ No.&amp;nbsp;1 Songs – 1930–1989] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616002911/http://ntl.matrix.com.br/pfilho/html/top1/ |date=June 16, 2010 }}.

In 1939, Holiday recorded her biggest selling record, &quot;[[Strange Fruit]]&quot; for Commodore, charting at number 16 on the available pop charts for the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/all_songs.htm#1939 Billie Holiday Studio Songs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414163506/http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/all_songs.htm |date=April 14, 2012 }}.

In 1940, ''Billboard'' began publishing its modern pop charts, which included the [[Billboard Hot 100|Best Selling Retail Records]] chart, the precursor to the Hot 100. None of Holiday's songs placed on the modern pop charts, partly because ''Billboard'' only published the first ten slots of the charts in some issues. Minor hits and independent releases had no way of being spotlighted.

&quot;[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]&quot;, which went on to sell over a million copies, ranked number 3 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end top songs of 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;jazzstandards.com&quot;/&gt;

On October 24, 1942, ''Billboard'' began issuing its R&amp;B charts. Two of Holiday's songs placed on the chart, &quot;[[Trav'lin' Light (song)|Trav'lin' Light]]&quot; with Paul Whiteman, which topped the chart, and &quot;[[Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)|Lover Man]]&quot;, which reached number 5. &quot;Trav'lin' Light&quot; also reached 18 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end chart.

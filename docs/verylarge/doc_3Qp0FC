=== The Germanic peoples ===

In ''De Bello Gallico'' 6.21–28, Julius Caesar provides his audience with a picture of Germanic lifestyle and culture. He depicts the Germans as primitive hunter gatherers with diets mostly consisting of meat and dairy products who only celebrate earthly gods such as the sun, fire, and the moon (6.21–22). German women reportedly wear small cloaks of deer hides and bathe in the river naked with their fellow men, yet their culture celebrates men who abstain from sex for as long as possible (6.21). Caesar concludes in chapters 25–28 by describing the Germans living in the almost-mythological Hercynian forest full of oxen with horns in the middle of their foreheads, elks without joints or ligatures, and uri who kill every man they come across.

However, the distinguishing characteristic of the Germans for Caesar, as described in chapters 23 and 24, is their warring nature, which they believe is a sign of true valour (''{{lang|la|hoc proprium virtutis existimant}}'', 6.23). The Germans have no neighbors, because they have driven everyone out from their surrounding territory (''{{lang|la|civitatibus maxima laus est quam latissime circum se vastatis finibus solitudines habere}}'', 6.23). Their greatest political power resides in the wartime magistrates, who have power over life and death (''{{lang|la|vitae necisque habeant potestatem}}'', 6.23). While Caesar certainly respects the warring instincts of the Germans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polito|first1=Robert|title=Caesar, the Germani, and Rome|journal=Hyperboreus|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=107–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wants his readers to see that their cultures are simply too barbaric, especially when contrasted with the high-class Gallic Druids described at the beginning of chapter six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=Armario|last2=Javier|first2=Francisco|title=El Barbaro: La Gran Innovacion De Julio Cesar|journal=Latomus|date=2002|volume=61|issue=3|pages=577–588}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Caesar writes that robberies committed outside of the state are legalized in hopes of teaching young people discipline and caution, an idea nearly offensive to the judicial practices of the Romans (''{{lang|la|ea iuventutis exercendae ac desidiae minuendae causa fieri praedicant}}'', 6.23). Caesar's generalizations, alongside the writings of Tacitus, form the barbaric identity of the Germans for the ancient world.

=== The Druids  ===
Caesar's account of the Druids and the &quot;superstitions&quot; of the Gallic nations are documented in book six chapters 13, 14 and 16–18 in ''De Bello Gallico''.  In chapter 13 he mentions the importance of Druids in the culture and social structure of Gaul at the time of his conquest. Chapter 14 addresses the education of the Druids and the high social standing that comes with their position. He first comments on the role of sacrificial practices in their daily lives in chapter 16. Caesar highlights the sacrificial practices of the Druids containing innocent people and the large sacrificial ceremony where hundreds of people were burnt alive at one time to protect the whole from famine, plague, and war (DBG 6.16). Chapter 17 and 18 focuses on the divinities the Gauls believed in and Dis, the god which they claim they were descended from. This account of the Druids highlights Caesar's interest in the order and importance of the Druids in Gaul.

Caesar spent a great amount of time in Gaul and his book is one of the best preserved accounts of the Druids from an author who was in Gaul.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=Jane|date=1999|title=At the End of the World: Druidic and Other Revitalization Movements in Post-Conquest Gaul and Britain|url=|journal=Britannia|volume=30|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Caesar provides what is seemingly a first-hand account, much of his knowledge of the Druids is not from personal experience, but rather the hearsay of others and is regarded as anachronistic.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Caesar based some of his account after that of Posidonius, who wrote a clear and well-known account of the Druids in Gaul.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Caesar provides his account of the Druids as a means of sharing his knowledge and educating the Roman people on the foreign conquests.

There is no doubt that the Druids offered sacrifices to their god. However, scholars are still uncertain about what they would offer. Caesar, along with other Roman authors, assert that the Druids would offer human sacrifices on numerous occasions for relief from disease and famine or for a successful war campaign. Caesar provides a detailed account of the manner in which the supposed human sacrifices occurred in chapter 16, claiming that &quot;they have images of immense size, the limbs of which are framed with twisted twigs and filled with living persons.  These being set on fire, those within are encompassed by the flames&quot; (DBG 6.16).

Caesar, however, also observes and mentions a civil Druid culture. In chapter 13, he claims that they select a single leader who ruled until his death, and a successor would be chosen by a vote or through violence. Also in chapter 13, he mentions that the Druids studied &quot;the stars and their movements, the size of the cosmos and the earth, the nature of the world, and the powers of immortal deities,&quot; signifying to the Roman people that the druids were also versed in astrology, cosmology, and theology. Although Caesar is one of the few primary sources on the druids, many believe that he had used his influence to portray the druids to the Roman people as both barbaric, as they perform human sacrifices, and civilized in order to depict the Druids as a society worth assimilating to Rome (DBG 6.16).

=== Vorenus and Pullo ===
Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo were two centurions in the garrison of [[Quintus Tullius Cicero]], brother of [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], and are mentioned in Book 5.44 of ''De Bello Gallico''. They were bitter rivals who both sought to achieve the greatest honors &quot;and every year used to contend for promotion with the utmost animosity&quot; [''{{lang|la|omnibusque annis de locis summis simultatibus contendebant}}''] (''DBG'' 5.44). Their garrison had come under siege during a rebellion by the tribes of the [[Belgae]] led by [[Ambiorix]]. They showed their prowess during this siege by jumping from the wall and directly into the enemy despite being completely outnumbered. During the fighting, they both find themselves in difficult positions and are forced to save each other, first Vorenus saving Pullo and then Pullo saving Vorenus. Through great bravery they are both able to make it back alive slaying many enemies in the process. They return to the camp showered in praise and honors by their fellow soldiers. The phrase, ''{{lang|la|Sic fortuna in contentione et certamine utrumque versavit, ut alter alteri inimicus auxilio salutique esset, neque diiudicari posset, uter utri virtute anteferendus videretur}}'', is used to emphasize that though they started out in competition, they both showed themselves to be worthy of the highest praise and equal to each other in bravery (''DBG'' 5.44).

Caesar uses this anecdote to illustrate the courage and bravery of his soldiers. Since his forces had already been humiliated and defeated in previous engagements, he needed to report a success story to Rome that would lift the spirits of the people. Furthermore, the tale of unity on the battlefield between two personal rivals is in direct opposition to the disunity of [[Quintus Titurius Sabinus|Sabinus]] and [[Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta|Cotta]], which resulted in the destruction of an entire legion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Robert|date=2004|title=Virtus Consili Expers: An Interpretation of the Centurions' Contest in Caesar, ''De Bello Gallico'' 5, 44.|jstor=4477610|journal=Hermes|volume=132|pages=292–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; He relates this particular account to illustrate that, despite the losses against Ambiorix and his army, Rome is still able to trust in the valor of its soldiers. Thus, Caesar turns a military blunder into a positive propaganda story.

===Hostage exchanges===
In the first two books of ''De Bello Gallico'', there are seven examples of hostage exchanges. First, the Helveti exchange hostages with the [[Sequani]] as a promise that the Sequani will let the Helveti pass and that the Helveti will not cause mischief (1.9 and 1.19).  The [[Helvetii|Helveti]] also give Caesar hostages to ensure that the Helveti keep their promises (1.14).  Then the [[Aedui]] gave hostages to the Sequani, during the Sequani's rise to power (1.31).  In book two, the [[Belgae]] were exchanging hostages to create an alliance against Rome (2.1) and  the [[Remi]] offered Caesar hostages in their surrender (2.3, 2.5).  Later in the book Caesar receives 600 hostages from the Aedui (2.15) and other hostages from most of Gaul (2.35).  This practice of exchanging hostages continues to be used throughout Caesar's campaigns in diplomacy and foreign policy.

Today the term [[hostage]] has a different connotation than it did for the Ancient Romans, which is shown in the examples above.  Where the Romans did take prisoners of war, hostages could also be given or exchanged in times of peace.  The taking of hostages as collateral during political arrangements was a common practice in ancient Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=A. D.|date=1991|title=The Role of Hostages in Roman Diplomacy with Sasanian Persia|url=|journal=Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte|volume=40|pages=366–374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the practice was that important people from each side were given to ensure that both sides kept their word; a type of contract.  Two examples of this is when Caesar demands the children of chieftains (2.5) and accepted the two sons of King Galba (2.13).  However, as seen by Caesar, sometimes it was only a one-way exchange, with Caesar taking hostages but not giving any.

There is evidence though, particularly in Caesar's ''De Bello Gallico'', indicating that the practice was not always effective. Cities often moved to revolt against Rome, even though hostages were in Roman custody. Occasionally, hostages would be entrusted to a neutral or mediating party during a revolt, such as the time one hundred hostages surrendered by the Senones were placed in the custody of the Aedui who helped negotiate between the revolutionaries and Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moscovich|first=M.J.|date=December 1979 – January 1980|title=Obsidibus Traditis: Hostages in Caesar's De Bello Gallico|url=|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=75|pages=122–128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources say there is not much evidence that hostages were even harmed, at least severely, in retribution of the broken agreements.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; It is commonly noted that Caesar never mentions penalties being dealt to hostages.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Taking hostages did benefit Rome in one particular way: since hostages were commonly the sons of political figures and would typically be under Roman watch for a year or more, Romans had ample time to introduce those hostages to the Roman customs in hopes that when they were freed, they would go on to become influential political leaders themselves and favor Rome in subsequent foreign relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Modern influence==
[[File:Julii Caesaris quae exstant.tif|thumb|C. Iulii Caesaris quae extant, 1678]]

===Educational use===
This book is often lauded for its polished, clear [[Latin]]; in particular, German historian Hans Herzfeld describes the work as &quot;a paradigm of proper reporting and stylistic clarity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Caesar''. In {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Herzfeld|de|vertical-align=sup}} (1960): ''Geschichte in Gestalten'' (''History in figures''), vol. 1: ''A–E''. {{Interlanguage link multi|Das Fischer Lexikon|de|vertical-align=sup}} 37, Frankfurt 1963, p. 214. &quot;Hauptquellen [betreffend Caesar]: Caesars eigene, wenn auch leicht tendenziöse Darstellungen des Gallischen und des Bürgerkrieges, die Musterbeispiele sachgemäßer Berichterstattung und stilistischer Klarheit sind&quot; (&quot;''Main sources [regarding Caesar]: Caesar's own, even though slightly tendentious depictions of the Gallic and the Civil Wars, which are paradigms of pertinent information and stylistic clarity''&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is traditionally the first authentic text assigned to students of Latin, as [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' is for students of [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]; they are both autobiographical tales of military adventure told in the third person. It contains many details and employs many stylistic devices to promote Caesar's political interests.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Albrecht, Michael v.: ''Geschichte der römischen Literatur Band 1'' (History of Roman Literature, Volume 1). Munich 1994, 2nd ed., p. 332–334.&lt;/ref&gt;

The books are valuable for the many geographical and historical claims that can be retrieved from the work. Notable chapters describe Gaulish custom (VI, 13), their religion (VI, 17), and a comparison between Gauls and Germanic peoples (VI, 24).

===''Astérix''===
Since Caesar is one of the characters in the ''[[Asterix|Astérix and Obélix]]'' albums, [[René Goscinny]] included [[humour in Asterix|gags]] for French schoolchildren who had the ''Commentarii'' as a textbook, even though Latin was then disappearing from French schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reception of Ancient Greece and Rome in Children's Literature: Heroes and Eagles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XJ-XCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA301|date=17 September 2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-29860-6|pages=301–}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is having Caesar talk about himself in the third person as in the book.

Most English editions of Asterix begin with the prelude: &quot;The year is 50 BC. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well not entirely! One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courrierinternational.com/article/2014/01/02/asterix-resiste-encore-et-toujours French original]: &quot;Nous sommes en 50 avant Jésus-Christ. Toute la Gaule est occupée par les Romains… Toute ? Non ! Car un village peuplé d’irréductibles Gaulois résiste encore et toujours à l’envahisseur.&quot; English translation on the [https://www.asterix.com/en/welcome-to-the-virtual-village/ official website].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 36th book of the Asterix series, ''[[Asterix and the Missing Scroll]]'', a fictitious and supposedly censored chapter from Caesar's ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' forms the basis for the story.

===Vorenus and Pullo===
In Book 5, Chapter 44 the ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' notably mentions [[Lucius Vorenus]] and [[Titus Pullo]], two [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[centurion]]s of the [[Legio XI|11th Legion]].&lt;ref&gt;Prior to its demobilization and subsequent remobilization by [[Augustus]]—see also [[List of Roman legions|Republican and Imperatorial legions]]. [[Julius Caesar]], ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5#44|5.44]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2005 [[television series]] [[Rome (TV series)|''Rome'']] gives a fictionalized account of Caesar's rise and fall, featuring [[Kevin McKidd]] as the [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|character of Lucius Vorenus]] and [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] as the [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|character of Titus Pullo]] of the [[Legio XIII Gemina|13th Legion]].

===Vincent d'Indy===
During [[World War I]] the French composer [[Vincent d'Indy]] wrote his Third Symphony, which bears the title ''De Bello Gallico''. D'Indy was adapting Caesar's title to the situation of the current struggle in France against the German army, in which he had a son and nephew fighting, and which the music illustrates to some extent.

== Manuscripts and publication history ==
Since the work of [[Karl Nipperdey]] in 1847, the existing manuscripts have been divided into two classes. The first (α) encompasses manuscripts containing only ''De Bello Gallico'' and characterized  by colophons with allusions to late antique ''correctores''. The oldest manuscript in this class is MS. Amsterdam 73, written at [[Fleury Abbey]] in the later ninth century. The second (β) encompasses manuscripts containing all of the related works—not only ''De Bello Gallico'', but ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili|De Bello Civili]]'', ''[[De Bello Alexandrino]]'', ''[[De Bello Africo]]'', and ''[[De Bello Hispaniensi]]'', always in that order. The oldest manuscript in this class is MS Paris lat. 3864, written at Corbie in the last quarter of the ninth century. For ''De Bello Gallico'', the readings of α are considered better than β.&lt;ref name=Winterbottom-35&gt;Michael Winterbottom, &quot;Caesar&quot;, in ''Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[editio princeps]]'' was published by [[Giovanni Andrea Bussi]] at Rome in 1469.&lt;ref name=Winterbottom-35/&gt;

== Historiography ==

=== Accuracy ===
Caesar's account was largely taken as truthful and accurate until the 20th century. Even in 1908, [[Camille Jullian]] wrote a comprehensive history of Gaul and took Caesar's account as unerring. But after World War II historians began to question if Caesar's claims stood up.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henige|first=David|date=1998|title=He came, he saw, we counted : the historiography and demography of Caesar's gallic numbers|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/adh_0066-2062_1998_num_1998_1_2162|journal=Annales de Démographie Historique|volume=1998|issue=1|pages=215–242|doi=10.3406/adh.1998.2162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[David Henige]] takes particular issue with the supposed population and warrior counts. Caesar claims that he was able to estimate the population of the Helvetii because in their camp there was a census, written in Greek on tablets, which would have indicated 263,000 Helvetii and 105,000 allies, of whom exactly one quarter (92,000) were combatants. But Henige points out that such a census would have been difficult to achieve by the Gauls, that it would make no sense to be written in Greek by non-Greek tribes, and that carrying such a large quantity of stone or wood tablets on their migration would have been a monumental feat. Henige finds it oddly convenient that exactly one quarter were combatants, suggesting that the numbers were more likely ginned up by Caesar than outright counted by census. Even contemporary authors estimated that the population of the Helvetii and their allies were lower, [[Livy]] surmised that there were 157,000 overall. But Henige still believes this number inaccurate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

During the campaign against the Usipetes and the Tenceri, Caesar makes the incredible claim that the Romans faced an army of 430,000 Gauls, that the Roman victory was overwhelming, that the Romans lost not a single soldier, and that upon their loss the Gauls committed mass suicide. Henige finds this entire story impossible, as did [[Ferdinand Lot]], writing in 1947. Lot was one of the first modern authors who directly questioned the validity of Caesar's numbers, finding a fighting force of 430,000 to have been unbelievable for the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; 

Not all contemporaries of Caesar believed the account to have been accurate. [[Gaius Asinius Pollio]], who served under Caesar, noted that the account had been put together without much care or regard for the truth. Still, Pollio attributed this to mistakes by Caesar's lieutenants, or even that Caesar intended to rewrite the text more accurately. Up until the 20th century authors tended to follow Pollio's thinking, attributing mistakes not to Caesar but to the process, such as errors in translation and transcription throughout time. [[Ernest Desjardins]], writing in 1876, suggested (in what Henige considers to be very charitable on Desjardins part) that the error in numbers in the Usipetes campaign was the result of a mis-transcription of &quot;CCCCXXX&quot; instead of &quot;XXXXIII&quot;, which would mean that the real size of the Gualic force was actually just 43,000. But even Henige suggests that it is possible the numbers have not always been accurately written down, and that the earliest surviving manuscripts are only from the ninth to twelfth centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Part of the dispute over the historiography of the ''Commentarii'' revolves around modern authors trying to use it to estimate the pre-Roman population of Gaul. In the 18th century, authors extrapolated from the text populations of 40{{En dash}}200 million. Authors in the 19th century guessed in the 15-20 million range based on the text. 20th century authors guessed as low as 4 million, with Henige giving a modern range of 4-48 million between authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Ultimately, Henige sees the ''Commentarii'' as a very clever piece of propaganda written by Caesar, built to make Caesar appear far grander than he was. Henige notes that Caesar's matter of fact tone and easy to read writing made it all the easier to accept his outlandish claims. Caesar sought to portray his fight as a justified defense against the barbarity of the Gauls (which was important, as Caesar had actually been the aggressor contrary to his claims). By making it appear that he had won against overwhelming odds and suffered minimal casualties, he further increased the belief that the he and the Romans were godly and destined to win against the godless barbarians of Gaul. Overall, Henige concludes that &quot;Julius Caesar must be considered one of history's earliest {{En dash}} and most durably successful {{En dash}} &quot;spin doctors&quot;&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

=== Authorship ===
Classicist Ruth Breindal believes it likely that Caesar did not directly write the work, but instead dictated most of it to a scribe at one time and the scribe wrote as Caesar spoke, or that the scribe took notes and wrote the account afterwards. Still, she does believe that Caesar had an overwhelming hand in creating the work, but believes much of the grammar and clarity of the work to be the result of the scribe or scribes involved. Breindal also considers the main point of the work to be as a propaganda piece to protect Caesars reputation in the vicious politics of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Breindel, R. L. (2016). [https://crossworks.holycross.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1116&amp;context=necj Who Wrote the Gallic Wars?]. ''New England Classical Journal'', ''43''(4), 253-283. &lt;/ref&gt; Book eight was written after Caesar's death in 44 BC by consul [[Aulus Hirtius]]; Hirtius must have written the book before his death in civil war in 43 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peck1898p248&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Peck|editor-first=Harry Thurston|editor-link=Harry Thurston Peck|title=Caesar, Gaius Iulius|encyclopedia=[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities]]|date=1963|orig-year=1898|page=248|location=New York|publisher=Cooper Square Publishers, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Synaptic screenshot.png|thumb|[[Synaptic (software)|Synaptic]], example of a full-featured package manager]]

A '''package manager''' or '''package-management system''' is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a [[computer]]'s [[operating system]] in a consistent manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aptitude.alioth.debian.org/doc/en/pr01s02.html |title=What is a package manager? |access-date=19 December 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017151526/http://aptitude.alioth.debian.org/doc/en/pr01s02.html |archive-date=17 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A package manager deals with [[package format|''packages'']], distributions of software and data in [[archive file]]s. Packages contain [[metadata]], such as the software's name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, [[checksum]] (preferably a [[cryptographic hash function]]), and a list of [[coupling (computer programming)|dependencies]] necessary for the software to run properly. Upon installation, metadata is stored in a local package database. Package managers typically maintain a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites. They work closely with [[software repository|software repositories]], [[binary repository manager]]s, and [[app store]]s.

Package managers are designed to eliminate the need for manual installs and updates. This can be particularly useful for large enterprises whose operating systems are typically consisting of hundreds or even tens of thousands of distinct software packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://software.dell.com/products/kace-k1000-systems-management-appliance/software-distribution.aspx |title=Software Distribution |accessdate=2012-07-11 |publisher=Dell KACE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003031633/http://software.dell.com/products/kace-k1000-systems-management-appliance/software-distribution.aspx |archive-date=3 October 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
[[File:Pms.svg|thumb|Illustration of a package manager being used to [[download]] new software. Manual actions can include accepting a license agreement or selecting some package-specific configuration options.]]

A software package is an [[archive file]] containing a computer program as well as necessary metadata for its deployment. The computer program can be in [[source code]] that has to be compiled and built first.&lt;ref&gt;Ludovic Courtès, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4584 Functional Package Management with Guix], June 2013, Madrid, European Lisp Symposium 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Package metadata include package description, package version, and dependencies (other packages that need to be installed beforehand).

Package managers are charged with the task of finding, installing, maintaining or uninstalling software packages upon the user's command. Typical functions of a package management system include:
*Working with [[file archiver]]s to extract package archives
*Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the package by verifying their [[checksum]]s and [[digital certificate]]s, respectively
*Looking up, downloading, installing, or updating existing software from a [[software repository]] or [[app store]]
*Grouping packages by function to reduce user confusion
*Managing dependencies to ensure a package is installed with all packages it requires, thus avoiding &quot;[[dependency hell]]&quot;

===Challenges with shared libraries===
Computer systems that rely on [[dynamic library]] linking, instead of [[static library]] linking, share executable libraries of machine instructions across packages and applications. In these systems, complex relationships between different packages requiring different versions of libraries results in a challenge colloquially known as &quot;[[dependency hell]]&quot;. On [[Microsoft Windows]] systems, this is also called &quot;[[DLL hell]]&quot; when working with dynamically linked libraries. Good package management is vital on these systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;sharedlibrary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first= Chris |last= Tucker |title= OPIUM: Optimal Package Install/Uninstall Manager |publisher= UC San Diego |date= 2007-03-15 |page=1 |journal=Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Software Engineering - ACM Conferences |doi=10.1109/ICSE.2007.59 |url= http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/papers/opium.pdf |accessdate= 2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Framework system from [[OPENSTEP]] was an attempt at solving this issue, by allowing multiple versions of libraries to be installed simultaneously, and for software packages to specify which version they were linked against.

===Front-ends for locally compiled packages===
[[System administrator]]s may install and maintain software using tools other than package management software. For example, a local administrator may [[download]] unpackaged source code, compile it, and install it. This may cause the state of the local system to fall out of [[synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] with the state of the package manager's [[database]]. The local administrator will be required to take additional measures, such as manually managing some dependencies or integrating the changes into the package manager.

There are tools available to ensure that locally compiled packages are integrated with the package management. For distributions based on .deb and [[RPM Package Manager|.rpm]] files as well as Slackware Linux, there is [[CheckInstall]], and for recipe-based systems such as [[Gentoo Linux]] and hybrid systems such as [[Arch Linux]], it is possible to write a recipe first, which then ensures that the package fits into the local package database.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Maintenance of configuration===
Particularly troublesome with software [[upgrade]]s are upgrades of configuration files. Since package managers, at least on Unix systems, originated as extensions of [[file archiver|file archiving utilities]], they can usually only either overwrite or retain configuration files, rather than applying rules to them. There are exceptions to this that usually apply to kernel configuration (which, if broken, will render the computer unusable after a restart). Problems can be caused if the format of configuration files changes; for instance, if the old configuration file does not explicitly disable new options that should be disabled. Some package managers, such as [[Debian]]'s [[dpkg]], allow configuration during installation. In other situations, it is desirable to install packages with the default configuration and then overwrite this configuration, for instance, in [[Headless system|headless]] installations to a large number of computers. This kind of pre-configured installation is also supported by dpkg.

===Repositories===
To give users more control over the kinds of software that they are allowing to be installed on their system (and sometimes due to legal or convenience reasons on the distributors' side), software is often downloaded from a number of [[software repository|software repositories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Linux repository classification schemes |url=http://braintickle.blogspot.com/2006/01/linux-repository-classification.html|publisher=braintickle.blogspot.com |accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upgrade suppression===
When a user interacts with the package management software to bring about an upgrade, it is customary to present the user with the list of actions to be executed (usually the list of packages to be upgraded, and possibly giving the old and new version numbers), and allow the user to either accept the upgrade in bulk, or select individual packages for upgrades. Many package managers can be configured to never upgrade certain packages, or to upgrade them only when critical vulnerabilities or instabilities are found in the previous version, as defined by the packager of the software. This process is sometimes called ''version pinning''.

For instance:
*[[Yellowdog Updater, Modified|yum]] supports this with the syntax ''exclude=openoffice*''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CentOS yum pinning rpms|url=http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/2005-May/046320.html|publisher=centos.org|accessdate=2008-03-01 |url-status=unfit |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071102203232/http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/2005-May/046320.html |archive-date= 2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pacman (package manager)|pacman]] with ''IgnorePkg= openoffice''&lt;ref name=pacman/&gt; (to suppress upgrading openoffice in both cases)
*[[dpkg]] and [[dselect]] support this partially through the ''hold'' flag in package selections
*[[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]] extends the ''hold'' flag through the complex &quot;pinning&quot; mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to keep specific versions of packages installed (complex)|url=https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-apt-get.en.html#s-pin|publisher=debian.org|accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Users can also blacklist a package&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apt pinning to blacklist a package|url=http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Debian/2009-07/msg00476.html|accessdate=2010-08-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722062625/http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Debian/2009-07/msg00476.html|archive-date=22 July 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*[[Aptitude (program)|aptitude]] has &quot;hold&quot; and &quot;forbid&quot; flags
*[[Portage (software)|portage]] supports this through the package.mask configuration file
&lt;!--(DotPet from .PET packages in [[Puppy Linux]], but is efficient in console and lightweight ?? --&gt;

===Cascading package removal===
Some of the more advanced package management features offer &quot;cascading package removal&quot;,&lt;ref name=pacman&gt;{{cite web |title=pacman(8) Manual Page|url=https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman.8.html|website=archlinux.org|accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which all packages that depend on the target package and all packages that only the target package depends on, are also removed.

===Comparison of commands===
Although the commands are specific for every particular package manager, they are to a large extent translatable, as most package managers offer similar functions.

This failed when his teenage successor, the [[Jianwen Emperor]], attempted to curtail his uncles' power, prompting the [[Jingnan Campaign]], an uprising that placed the Prince of Yan upon the throne as the [[Yongle Emperor]] in 1402. The Yongle Emperor established Yan as a secondary capital and renamed it [[Beijing]], constructed the [[Forbidden City]], and restored the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] and the primacy of the [[keju|imperial examinations]] in official appointments. He rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the Confucian [[scholar-bureaucrats]].

The growth of [[economic history of Portugal#Triangular trade between China, Japan, and Europe|Portuguese]], [[Economic history of Spain#Gold and silver from the New World|Spanish]], and [[Economic history of the Netherlands (1500–1815)|Dutch]] trade created new demand for Chinese products and produced a massive influx of [[Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine|Japanese]] and [[Manila galleons|American]] silver. This abundance of specie remonetized the Ming economy, whose [[Ming currency|paper money]] had suffered repeated [[hyperinflation]] and was no longer trusted. While traditional Confucians opposed such a prominent role for commerce and the newly rich it created, the [[heterodoxy]] introduced by [[Wang Yangming]] permitted a more accommodating attitude. [[Zhang Juzheng]]'s initially successful reforms proved devastating when a slowdown in agriculture produced by the [[Little Ice Age]] joined changes in Japanese and Spanish policy that quickly cut off the supply of silver now necessary for farmers to be able to pay their taxes. Combined with crop failure, floods, and epidemic, the dynasty collapsed before the rebel leader [[Li Zicheng]], who was himself defeated shortly afterward by the Manchu-led [[Eight Banner]] armies who founded the [[Qing dynasty]].

===Founding===

====Revolt and rebel rivalry====
The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]]-led [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) ruled before the establishment of the Ming dynasty. Explanations for the demise of the Yuan include institutionalized ethnic discrimination against [[Han Chinese]] that stirred resentment and rebellion, overtaxation of areas hard-hit by [[inflation]], and massive flooding of the [[Yellow River]] as a result of the abandonment of irrigation projects.{{sfnp|Gascoigne|2003|p=150}} Consequently, agriculture and the economy were in shambles, and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dykes of the Yellow River.{{sfnp|Gascoigne|2003|p=150}} A number of Han Chinese groups revolted, including the [[Red Turban Rebellion|Red Turbans]] in 1351. The Red Turbans were affiliated with the [[White Lotus]], a [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhist]] secret society. [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] was a penniless peasant and Buddhist monk who joined the Red Turbans in 1352; he soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|pp=190–191}} In 1356, Zhu's rebel force captured the city of [[Nanjing]],{{sfnp|Gascoigne|2003|p=151}} which he would later establish as the capital of the Ming dynasty.

With the [[Yuan dynasty]] crumbling, competing rebel groups began fighting for control of the country and thus the right to [[Dynastic cycle|establish a new dynasty]]. In 1363, Zhu Yuanzhang eliminated his archrival and leader of the rebel Han faction, [[Chen Youliang]], in the [[Battle of Lake Poyang]], arguably the [[largest naval battle in history]]. Known for its ambitious use of [[fire ships]], Zhu's force of 200,000 Ming sailors were able to defeat a Han rebel force over triple their size, claimed to be 650,000-strong. The victory destroyed the last opposing rebel faction, leaving Zhu Yuanzhang in uncontested control of the bountiful [[Yangtze River Valley]] and cementing his power in the south. After the dynastic head of the Red Turbans suspiciously died in 1367 while a guest of Zhu, there was no one left who was remotely capable of contesting his march to the throne, and he made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the Yuan capital [[Khanbaliq|Dadu]] (present-day [[Beijing]]) in 1368.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=191}} The last Yuan emperor fled north to the upper capital [[Shangdu]], and Zhu declared the founding of the Ming dynasty after razing the Yuan palaces in Dadu to the ground;{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=191}} the city was renamed Beiping in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naquin|first=Susan|title = Peking: Temples and City Life, 1400–1900 | year = 2000|publisher=University of California press|isbn=978-0-520-21991-5|location=Berkeley|page=xxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhu Yuanzhang took Hongwu, or &quot;Vastly Martial&quot;, as his [[Chinese era name|era name]].

====Reign of the Hongwu Emperor====
[[File:A Seated Portrait of Ming Emperor Taizu.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the [[Hongwu Emperor]] (ruled in 1368–98)]]
Hongwu made an immediate effort to rebuild state infrastructure. He built a {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} long [[City Wall of Nanjing|wall around Nanjing]], as well as new palaces and government halls.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=191}} The ''[[History of Ming]]'' states that as early as 1364 Zhu Yuanzhang had begun drafting a new [[Confucianism|Confucian]] law code, the ''Da Ming Lü'', which was completed by 1397 and repeated certain clauses found in the old [[Tang Code]] of 653.{{sfnp|Andrew|Rapp|2000|p=25}} Hongwu organized a military system known as the ''weisuo'', which was similar to the [[Fubing system|''fubing'' system]] of the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).

In 1380 Hongwu had the Chancellor [[Hu Weiyong]] executed upon suspicion of a conspiracy plot to overthrow him; after that Hongwu abolished the [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellery]] and assumed this role as chief executive and emperor, a precedent mostly followed throughout the Ming period.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|pp=192–193}}{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=130}} With a growing suspicion of his ministers and subjects, Hongwu established the [[Jinyiwei]], a network of [[secret police]] drawn from his own palace guard. Some 100,000 people were executed in a series of purges during his rule.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|pp=192–193}}{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|pp=129–130}}

The Hongwu emperor issued many edicts forbidding Mongol practices and proclaiming his intention to purify China of barbarian influence. However, he also sought to use the Yuan legacy to legitimize his authority in China and other areas ruled by the Yuan. He continued policies of the Yuan dynasty such as continued request for Korean concubines and eunuchs, Mongol-style hereditary military institutions, Mongol-style clothing and hats, promoting archery and horseback riding, and having large numbers of Mongols serve in the Ming military. Until the late 16th century Mongols still constituted one-in-three officers serving in capital forces like the [[Embroidered Uniform Guard]], and other peoples such as [[Jurchens]] were also prominent.{{sfnp|Robinson|2008|pp=365–399}} He frequently wrote to Mongol, Japanese, Korean, Jurchen, Tibetan and Southwest frontier rulers offering advice on their governmental and dynastic policy, and insisted on leaders from these regions visiting the Ming capital for audiences. He resettled 100,000 Mongols into his territory, with many serving as guards in the capital. The emperor also strongly advertised the hospitality and role granted to Chinggisid nobles in his court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=David M.

====South-Western frontier====
{{Main|Ming conquest of Yunnan}}
In [[Qinghai]], the [[Salar people|Salar]] Muslims voluntarily came under Ming rule, their clan leaders capitulating around 1370. [[Kingdom of Qocho|Uyghur]] troops under Uyghur general Hala Bashi suppressed the [[Miao Rebellions (Ming dynasty)|Miao Rebellions]] of the 1370s and settled in [[Changde]], [[Hunan]].&lt;ref name=harmony&gt;{{cite news |title=Ethnic Uygurs in Hunan Live in Harmony with Han Chinese |newspaper=People's Daily |date=29 December 2000 | url = http://english.people.com.cn/english/200012/28/eng20001228_59085.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hui Muslim troops also settled in Changde, Hunan after serving the Ming in campaigns against other aboriginal tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ePxMW066j8C&amp;pg=PA133 |title=Negotiating ethnicity in China: citizenship as a response to the state | author =Zhiyu Shi|year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press|edition=illustrated |isbn=978-0-415-28372-4 |page=133 |volume=Volume 13 of Routledge studies – China in transition | accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1381, the Ming dynasty annexed the areas of the southwest that had once been part of the [[Kingdom of Dali]] following the successful effort by Hui Muslim Ming armies to defeat [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]]-loyalist Mongol and Hui Muslim troops holding out in Yunnan province. The [[Hui people|Hui]] troops under General [[Mu Ying]], who was appointed Governor of Yunnan, were resettled in the region as part of a colonization effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;pg=PA34 |title= China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects |author=Michael Dillon |year=1999 |publisher=Curzon Press |location=Richmond |page=34 |isbn=978-0-7007-1026-3 | accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 14th century, some 200,000 military colonists settled some 2,000,000 ''mu'' (350,000 acres) of land in what is now [[Yunnan]] and [[Guizhou]]. Roughly half a million more Chinese settlers came in later periods; these migrations caused a major shift in the ethnic make-up of the region, since formerly more than half of the population were non-Han peoples. Resentment over such massive changes in population and the resulting government presence and policies sparked more [[Miao people|Miao]] and [[Yao people|Yao]] revolts in 1464 to 1466, which were crushed by an army of 30,000 Ming troops (including 1,000 Mongols) joining the 160,000 local [[Guangxi]] (see [[Miao Rebellions (Ming dynasty)]]). After the scholar and philosopher [[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529) suppressed another rebellion in the region, he advocated single, unitary administration of Chinese and indigenous ethnic groups in order to bring about [[Sinicization|sinification]] of the local peoples.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=197}}

====Campaign in the North-East====
{{Main|Manchuria under Ming rule}}
[[File:Chemin de ronde muraille long.JPG|thumb|The [[Great Wall of China]]: Although the [[rammed earth]] walls of the ancient [[Warring States]] were combined into a unified wall under the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han dynasty|Han]] dynasties, the vast majority of the brick and stone Great Wall seen today is a product of the Ming dynasty.]]

After the overthrow of the [[Mongols|Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]] by the Ming dynasty in 1368, Manchuria remained under control of the Mongols of the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]] based in [[Mongolia]]. [[Naghachu]], a former Yuan official and a [[Uriankhai]] general of the Northern Yuan dynasty, won hegemony over the Mongol tribes in Manchuria ([[Liaoyang province]] of the former Yuan dynasty). He grew strong in the northeast, with forces large enough (numbering hundreds of thousands) to threaten invasion of the newly founded Ming dynasty in order to restore the Mongols to power in China. The Ming decided to defeat him instead of waiting for the Mongols to attack. In 1387 the Ming sent [[Ming military campaign against Naghachu|a military campaign to attack Naghachu]],&lt;ref&gt;Harmony and War: Confucian Culture and Chinese Power Politics, by Yuan-kang Wang&lt;/ref&gt; which concluded with the surrender of Naghachu and Ming conquest of Manchuria.

The early Ming court could not, and did not, aspire to the control imposed upon the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] in Manchuria by the Mongols, yet it created a norm of organization that would ultimately serve as the principal vehicle for the relations with peoples along the northeast frontiers. By the end of the Hongwu reign, the essentials of a policy toward the Jurchens had taken shape. Most of the inhabitants of Manchuria, except for the wild Jurchens, were at peace with China. The Ming had created many guards (衛, wei) in Manchuria, but the creation of a guard did not necessarily imply political control. In 1409, the Ming dynasty under Yongle Emperor established the [[Nurgan Regional Military Commission]] on the banks of the [[Amur River]], and [[Yishiha]], a eunuch of [[Haixi Jurchens|Haixi Jurchen]] derivation, was ordered to lead an expedition to the mouth of the Amur to pacify the Wild Jurchens. After the death of Yongle Emperor, the Nurgan Regional Military Commission was abolished in 1435, and the Ming court ceased to have substantial activities there, although the guards continued to exist in Manchuria. By the late Ming period, Ming political presence in Manchuria had waned considerably.

The ''[[History of Ming|Mingshi]]'' – the official history of the Ming dynasty compiled by the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1739 – states that the Ming established itinerant commanderies overseeing Tibetan administration while also renewing titles of ex-Yuan dynasty officials from [[Tibet]] and conferring new princely titles on leaders of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist sects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mingshi&quot;&gt;''[[Mingshi]]''-Geography I &quot;明史•地理一&quot;: 東起朝鮮，西據吐番，南包安南，北距大磧。; Geography III &quot;明史•地理三&quot;: 七年七月置西安行都衛於此，領河州、朵甘、烏斯藏、三衛。; Western territory III &quot;明史•列傳第二百十七西域三&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, Turrell V. Wylie states that [[censorship]] in the ''Mingshi'' in favor of bolstering the Ming emperor's prestige and reputation at all costs obfuscates the nuanced history of Sino-Tibetan relations during the Ming era.{{sfnp|Wylie|2003|p=470}}

Modern scholars debate whether the Ming dynasty had [[sovereignty]] over Tibet. Some believe it was a relationship of loose [[suzerainty]] that was largely cut off when the [[Jiajing Emperor]] (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of [[Daoism]] at court.{{sfnp|Wylie|2003|p=470}}{{sfnp|Wang|Nyima|1997|pp=1–40}} Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship.{{sfnp|Norbu|2001|p=52}}{{sfnp|Kolmaš|1967|p=32}} Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the [[Tibet during the Ming dynasty#Tribute and exchanging tea for horses|tea-horse trade]].{{sfnp|Wang|Nyima|1997|pp=39–40}}{{sfnp|Sperling|2003|pp=474–75, 478}}{{sfnp|Perdue|2000|p=273}}{{sfnp|Kolmaš|1967|pp=28–29}}

The Ming sporadically sent armed forays into Tibet during the 14th century, which the Tibetans successfully resisted.{{sfnp|Langlois|1988|pp=139, 161}}{{sfnp|Geiss|1988|pp=417–418}} Several scholars point out that unlike the preceding Mongols, the Ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in Tibet.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=227}}{{sfnp|Wang|Nyima|1997|p=38}} The [[Wanli Emperor]] (r. 1572–1620) attempted to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations in the wake of a [[History of Tibet#The origin of the title of 'Dalai Lama'|Mongol-Tibetan alliance]] initiated in 1578, an alliance which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent Manchu [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) in their support for the [[Dalai Lama]] of the [[Gelug|Yellow Hat]] sect.{{sfnp|Wylie|2003|p=470}}{{sfnp|Kolmaš|1967|pp=30–31}}{{sfnp|Goldstein|1997|p=8}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Ming Biographical Dictionary 23&quot;&gt;The Ming Biographical Dictionary (1976), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 16th century, the Mongols proved to be successful armed protectors of the Yellow Hat Dalai Lama after their increasing presence in the [[Amdo]] region, culminating in the [[Mongol conquest of Tibet|conquest of Tibet]] by [[Güshi Khan]] (1582–1655) in 1642,{{sfnp|Wylie|2003|p=470}}{{sfnp|Kolmaš|1967|pp=34–35}}{{sfnp|Goldstein|1997|pp=6–9}} establishing the [[Khoshut Khanate]].

===Reign of the Yongle Emperor===
{{Main|Yongle Emperor}}

====Rise to power====
[[File:Anonymous-Ming Chengzu.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of the [[Yongle Emperor]] (ruled in 1402–24)]]
The [[Hongwu Emperor]] specified his grandson Zhu Yunwen as his successor, and he assumed the throne as the [[Jianwen Emperor]] (1398–1402) after Hongwu's death in 1398. The most powerful of Hongwu's sons, Zhu Di, then the militarily mighty disagreed with this, and soon a political showdown erupted between him and his nephew Jianwen.{{sfnp|Robinson|2000|p=527}} After Jianwen arrested many of Zhu Di's associates, Zhu Di plotted a rebellion that sparked a [[Jingnan Campaign|three-year civil war]]. Under the pretext of rescuing the young Jianwen from corrupting officials, Zhu Di personally led forces in the revolt; the palace in Nanjing was burned to the ground, along with Jianwen himself, his wife, mother, and courtiers. Zhu Di assumed the throne as the [[Yongle Emperor]] (1402–1424); his reign is universally viewed by scholars as a &quot;second founding&quot; of the Ming dynasty since he reversed many of his father's policies.{{sfnp|Atwell|2002|p=84}}

====New capital and foreign engagement====
Yongle demoted Nanjing to a secondary capital and in 1403 announced the new capital of China was to be at his power base in [[Beijing]]. Construction of a new city there lasted from 1407 to 1420, employing hundreds of thousands of workers daily.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=272}} At the center was the political node of the [[Imperial City (Beijing)|Imperial City]], and at the center of this was the [[Forbidden City]], the palatial residence of the emperor and his family. By 1553, the Outer City was added to the south, which brought the overall size of Beijing to 4 by 4½ miles.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=194}}

[[File:Noel 2005 Pékin tombeaux Ming voie des âmes.jpg|thumb|The [[Ming Tombs]] located {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Beijing]]; the site was chosen by Yongle.]]

Beginning in 1405, the Yongle Emperor entrusted his favored [[eunuch]] commander [[Zheng He]] (1371–1433) as the admiral for a gigantic new fleet of ships designated for international [[treasure voyages|tributary missions]]. The Chinese had [[Foreign relations of Imperial China|sent diplomatic missions]] over land since the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE – 220 CE) and engaged in [[Economy of the Song dynasty|private overseas trade]], but these missions were unprecedented in grandeur and scale. To service seven different tributary voyages, the Nanjing shipyards constructed two thousand vessels from 1403 to 1419, including [[Chinese treasure ship|treasure ships]] measuring 112&amp;nbsp;m (370&amp;nbsp;ft) to 134&amp;nbsp;m (440&amp;nbsp;ft) in length and 45&amp;nbsp;m (150&amp;nbsp;ft) to 54&amp;nbsp;m (180&amp;nbsp;ft) in width.{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=137}}

Yongle used [[woodblock printing]] to spread Chinese culture. He also [[Ming dynasty military conquests|used the military]] to expand China's borders. This included the [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam|brief occupation of Vietnam]], from the initial invasion in 1406 until the Ming withdrawal in 1427 as a result of protracted [[guerrilla warfare]] led by [[Lê Lợi]], the founder of the Vietnamese [[Lê dynasty]].{{sfnp|Wang|1998|pp=317–327}}

The [[Oirats|Oirat]] leader [[Esen Tayisi]] launched an invasion into Ming China in July 1449. The chief eunuch [[Wang Zhen (eunuch)|Wang Zhen]] encouraged the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] (r. 1435–49) to lead a force personally to face the Oirats after a recent Ming defeat; the emperor left the capital and put his half-brother [[Zhu Qiyu]] in charge of affairs as temporary regent. On 8 September, Esen routed Zhengtong's army, and Zhengtong was captured – an event known as the [[Tumu Crisis]].{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=273}} The Oirats held the Zhengtong Emperor for ransom. However, this scheme was foiled once the emperor's younger brother assumed the throne under the era name [[Jingtai Emperor|Jingtai]] (r. 1449–57); the Oirats were also repelled once the Jingtai Emperor's confidant and defense minister [[Yu Qian]] (1398–1457) gained control of the Ming armed forces. Holding the Zhengtong Emperor in captivity was a useless bargaining chip for the Oirats as long as another sat on his throne, so they released him back into Ming China.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=273}} The former emperor was placed under house arrest in the palace until the coup against the Jingtai Emperor in 1457 known as the &quot;Wresting the Gate Incident&quot;.{{sfnp|Robinson|1999|p=83}} The former emperor retook the throne under the new era name [[Emperor Yingzong of Ming|Tianshun]] (r. 1457–64).

[[Emperor Yingzong of Ming|Tianshun]] proved to be a troubled time and Mongol forces within the Ming military structure continued to be problematic. On 7 August 1461, the Chinese general Cao Qin and his Ming troops of Mongol descent [[Rebellion of Cao Qin|staged a coup against the Tianshun Emperor]] out of fear of being next on his purge-list of those who aided him in the Wresting the Gate Incident.{{sfnp|Robinson|1999|pp=84–85}} Cao's rebel force managed to set fire to the western and eastern gates of the [[Imperial City (Beijing)|Imperial City]] (doused by rain during the battle) and killed several leading ministers before his forces were finally cornered and he was forced to commit suicide.{{sfnp|Robinson|1999|pp=79, 101–08}}

While the [[Yongle Emperor]] had staged [[Yongle Emperor's campaigns against the Mongols|five major offensives north]] of the [[Great Wall]] against the Mongols and the Oirats, the constant threat of Oirat incursions prompted the Ming authorities to fortify the Great Wall from the late 15th century to the 16th century; nevertheless, John Fairbank notes that &quot;it proved to be a futile military gesture but vividly expressed China's siege mentality.&quot;{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=139}} Yet the Great Wall was not meant to be a purely defensive fortification; its towers functioned rather as a series of lit beacons and signalling stations to allow rapid warning to friendly units of advancing enemy troops.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=208}}

====Later reign of the Wanli Emperor====
[[File:MingShenzong1.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Wanli Emperor]] (ruled in 1572–1620) in state ceremonial court dress]]
The financial drain of the [[Imjin War]] in Korea against the Japanese was one of the many problems – fiscal or other – facing Ming China during the reign of the [[Wanli Emperor]] (1572–1620). In the beginning of his reign, Wanli surrounded himself with able advisors and made a conscientious effort to handle state affairs. His Grand Secretary [[Zhang Juzheng]] (1572–82) built up an effective network of alliances with senior officials. However, there was no one after him skilled enough to maintain the stability of these alliances;{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=31}} officials soon banded together in opposing political factions.

====Role of eunuchs====
[[File:Porcelain tea cups from the reign of the Tianqi Emperor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tianqi Emperor|Tianqi-era]] teacups, from the Nantoyōsō Collection in Japan; the Tianqi Emperor was heavily influenced and largely controlled by the eunuch [[Wei Zhongxian]] (1568–1627).]]
The Hongwu Emperor forbade eunuchs to learn how to read or engage in politics. Whether or not these restrictions were carried out with absolute success in his reign, eunuchs during the Yongle Emperor's reign and afterwards managed huge imperial workshops, commanded armies, and participated in matters of appointment and promotion of officials. The eunuchs developed their own bureaucracy that was organized parallel to but was not subject to the civil service bureaucracy.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|pp=194–195}} Although there were several dictatorial eunuchs throughout the Ming, such as [[Wang Zhen (eunuch)|Wang Zhen]], [[Wang Zhi (pirate)|Wang Zhi]], and [[Liu Jin]], excessive tyrannical eunuch power did not become evident until the 1590s when the [[Wanli Emperor]] increased their rights over the civil bureaucracy and granted them power to collect provincial taxes.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=17}}{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=11}}

The eunuch [[Wei Zhongxian]] (1568–1627) dominated the court of the [[Tianqi Emperor]] (r. 1620–1627) and had his political rivals tortured to death, mostly the vocal critics from the faction of the [[Donglin movement|Donglin Society]]. He ordered temples built in his honor throughout the Ming Empire, and built personal palaces created with funds allocated for building the previous emperor's tombs. His friends and family gained important positions without qualifications. Wei also published a historical work lambasting and belittling his political opponents.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|pp=17–18}} The instability at court came right as natural calamity, pestilence, rebellion, and foreign invasion came to a peak. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] (r. 1627–44) had Wei dismissed from court, which led to Wei's suicide shortly after.

The eunuchs built their own social structure, providing and gaining support to their birth clans. Instead of fathers promoting sons, it was a matter of uncles promoting nephews.
The Heishanhui Society in Peking sponsored the temple that conducted rituals for worshiping the memory of Gang Tie, a powerful eunuch of the Yuan dynasty. The Temple became an influential base for highly placed eunuchs, and continued in a somewhat diminished role during the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Chen, . &quot;Castration and connection: Kinship organization among Ming Eunuchs.&quot; ''Ming Studies'' 2016.74 (2016): 27–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Robinson,  &quot;Notes on Eunuchs in Hebei during the Mid-Ming Period.&quot; ''Ming Studies''  (1995) 1: 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shih-shan Henry Tsai, ''The Eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty'' (SUNY series in Chinese Local Studies, 1995).[https://www.amazon.com/Eunuchs-Dynasty-Chinese-Local-Studies/dp/0791426882/ Excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic breakdown and natural disasters====
{{further|Europeans in Medieval China}}
[[File:Ch'iu Ying 001.jpg|thumb|''Spring morning in a Han palace'', by [[Qiu Ying]] (1494–1552); excessive luxury and decadence marked the late Ming period, spurred by the enormous state [[bullion]] of incoming silver and by private transactions involving silver.]]
During the last years of the Wanli era and those of his two successors, an economic crisis developed that was centered on a sudden widespread lack of the empire's chief medium of exchange: silver. [[Kingdom of Portugal|The Portuguese]] first [[Rafael Perestrello|established trade with China]] in 1516,{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=124}} trading Japanese silver for Chinese silk,{{sfnp|Spence|1999|pp=19–20}} and after some [[Fernão Pires de Andrade|initial hostilities]] gained consent from the Ming court in 1557 to settle [[Macau]] as their permanent trade base in China.{{sfnp|Wills|1998|pp=343–349}} Their role in providing silver was gradually surpassed by [[Spanish Empire|the Spanish]],{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=20}}{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=205}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/potosi-the-mountain-of-silver-that-was-the-first-global-city|title=Potosí: the mountain of silver that was the first global city|last=Lane|first=Kris|date=30 July 2019|website=[[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]]|language=en|access-date=4 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; while even [[Dutch Empire|the Dutch]] challenged them for control of this trade.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=206, 208}}{{sfnp|Wills|1998|pp=349–353}} [[Philip IV of Spain]] (r. 1621–1665) began cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] through the [[Philippines]] towards China, in favor of [[Manila galleon|shipping American-mined silver]] through Spanish ports. In 1639 the new [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers, cutting off another source of silver coming into China. These events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=208}} People began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it, forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline. In the 1630s a string of one thousand [[Cash (Chinese coin)|copper coins]] equaled an ounce of silver; by 1640 that sum could fetch half an ounce; and, by 1643 only one-third of an ounce.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=20}} For peasants this meant economic disaster, since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|pp=20–21}}  Recent historians have debated the validity of the theory that silver shortages caused the downfall of the Ming dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Atwell, &quot;Another look at silver imports into China, ca. 1635-1644.&quot; ''Journal of World History'' (2005): 467–489 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20079347 online].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Billy K.

Famines became common in northern China in the early 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event now known as the [[Little Ice Age]].{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=21}} Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=21}} The central government, starved of resources, could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities. Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing an unknown but large number of people.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|pp=22–24}} The deadliest earthquake of all time, the [[1556 Shaanxi earthquake|Shaanxi earthquake of 1556]], occurred during the [[Jiajing Emperor]]'s reign, killing approximately 830,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4128509.stm Tsunami among world's worst disasters].

====Rise of the Manchu====
[[File:Shanhaiguan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]] along the Great Wall, the gate where the Manchus were repeatedly repelled before being finally let through by [[Wu Sangui]] in 1644.]]
A [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribal leader named [[Nurhaci]] (r. 1616–26), starting with just a small tribe, rapidly gained control over all the [[Manchuria|Manchurian tribes]]. During the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions of Joseon Korea]] in the 1590s, he offered to lead his tribes in support of the Ming and [[Joseon]] army. This offer was declined, but he was granted honorific Ming titles for his gesture. Recognizing the weakness of Ming authority north of their border, he united all of the adjacent northern tribes and consolidated power in the region surrounding his homeland as the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jurchen Jin dynasty]] had done previously.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=27}} In 1610, he broke relations with the Ming court, and in 1618 demanded a tribute from them to redress &quot;Seven Grievances&quot;.

By 1636, Nurhaci's son [[Huang Taiji]] renamed his dynasty from the &quot;Later Jin&quot; to the &quot;[[Qing dynasty|Great Qing]]&quot; at [[Shenyang|Mukden]], which had fallen to Qing forces in 1621 and was made their capital in 1625.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|pp=24, 28}}{{sfnp|Chang|2007|p=92}} Huang Taiji also adopted the Chinese imperial title ''[[Emperor of China|huangdi]]'', declared the [[Huang Taiji|Chongde]] (&quot;Revering Virtue&quot;) era, and changed the ethnic name of his people from &quot;[[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]&quot; to &quot;[[Manchu people|Manchu]]&quot;.{{sfnp|Chang|2007|p=92}}{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=31}} In 1638 the Manchu defeated and conquered Ming China's traditional ally Joseon with an army of 100,000 troops in the [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea]]. Shortly after, the Koreans renounced their long-held loyalty to the Ming dynasty.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=31}}

====Rebellion, invasion, collapse====
{{main|Qing conquest of the Ming}}
A peasant soldier named [[Li Zicheng]] mutinied with his fellow soldiers in western Shaanxi in the early 1630s after the Ming government failed to ship much-needed supplies there.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=21}} In 1634 he was captured by a Ming general and released only on the terms that he return to service.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|pp=21–22}} The agreement soon broke down when a local magistrate had thirty-six of his fellow rebels executed; Li's troops retaliated by killing the officials and continued to lead a rebellion based in Rongyang, central [[Henan]] province by 1635.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=22}} By the 1640s, an ex-soldier and rival to Li – [[Zhang Xianzhong]] (1606–1647) – had created a firm rebel base in [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]], while Li's center of power was in [[Hubei]] with extended influence over Shaanxi and Henan.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=22}}

In 1640, masses of Chinese peasants who were starving, unable to pay their taxes, and no longer in fear of the frequently defeated Chinese army, began to form into huge bands of rebels. The Chinese military, caught between fruitless efforts to defeat the Manchu raiders from the north and huge peasant revolts in the provinces, essentially fell apart. Unpaid and unfed, the army was defeated by Li Zicheng – now self-styled as the Prince of [[Shun dynasty|Shun]] – and deserted the capital without much of a fight. On 25 April 1644, Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng when the city gates were opened by rebel allies from within. During the turmoil, [[Chongzhen Emperor|the last Ming emperor]] hanged himself [[Guilty Chinese Scholartree|on a tree in the imperial garden]] outside the Forbidden City.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=25}}

[[File:Ming Chongzhen.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] (r. 1627–44)]]

Seizing opportunity, the [[Eight Banners]] crossed the [[Great Wall]] after the Ming border general [[Wu Sangui]] (1612–1678) opened the gates at [[Shanhai Pass]]. This occurred shortly after he learned about the fate of the capital and an army of Li Zicheng marching towards him; weighing his options of alliance, he decided to side with the Manchus.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|pp=32–33}} The Eight Banners under the Manchu Prince [[Dorgon]] (1612–1650) and Wu Sangui approached Beijing after the army sent by Li was destroyed at [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]]; the Prince of Shun's army fled the capital on the fourth of June. On 6 June, the Manchus and Wu entered the capital and proclaimed the young [[Shunzhi Emperor]] ruler of China. After being forced out of [[Xi'an]] by the Qing, chased along the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]] to [[Wuchang, Hubei|Wuchang]], and finally along the northern border of [[Jiangxi]] province, Li Zicheng died there in the summer of 1645, thus ending the [[Shun dynasty]]. One report says his death was a suicide; another states that he was beaten to death by peasants after he was caught stealing their food.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=33}}

Despite the loss of Beijing and the death of the emperor, the Ming were not yet totally destroyed. Nanjing, Fujian, Guangdong, Shanxi, and Yunnan were all strongholds of Ming resistance. However, there were several pretenders for the Ming throne, and their forces were divided. These scattered Ming remnants in southern China after 1644 were collectively designated by 19th-century historians as the [[Southern Ming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Southern Ming, 1644–1662.

In 1725 the Qing [[Yongzheng Emperor]] bestowed the hereditary title of Marquis on a descendant of the [[House of Zhu|Ming dynasty Imperial family]], Zhu Zhilian (朱之璉), who received a salary from the Qing government and whose duty was to perform rituals at the [[Ming tombs]]. The Chinese Plain White Banner was also inducted in the Eight Banners. Later the [[Qianlong Emperor]] bestowed the title [[Marquis of Extended Grace]] posthumously on Zhu Zhilian in 1750, and the title passed on through twelve generations of Ming descendants until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912. The last Marquis of Extended Grance was Zhu Yuxun (朱煜勳). In 1912, after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in the [[Xinhai Revolution]], some advocated that a Han Chinese be installed as Emperor, either the descendant of Confucius, who was the [[Duke Yansheng]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodhouse2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Eiko Woodhouse|title=The Chinese Hsinhai Revolution: G.

Throughout the Song dynasty, the largest political division was the [[Circuit (country subdivision)|circuit]] (''lu'' 路).{{sfnp|Yuan|1994|pp=193–194}} However, after the [[Jingkang Incident|Jurchen invasion]] in 1127, the Song court established four semi-autonomous regional command systems based on territorial and military units, with a detached service secretariat that would become the provincial administrations of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.{{sfnp|Hartwell|1982|pp=397–398}} Copied on the Yuan model, the Ming provincial bureaucracy contained three commissions: one civil, one military, and one for surveillance. Below the level of the [[Province (China)|province]] (''sheng'' 省) were [[Prefecture (China)|prefectures]] (''fu'' 府) operating under a prefect (''zhifu'' 知府), followed by [[Zhou (country subdivision)|subprefectures]] (''zhou'' 州) under a subprefect. The lowest unit was the [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|county]] (''xian'' 縣), overseen by a magistrate. Besides the provinces, there were also two large areas that belonged to no province, but were metropolitan areas (''jing'' 京) attached to Nanjing and Beijing.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=5}}

===Institutions and bureaus===

====Institutional trends====
[[File:Gugong.jpg|thumb| The [[Forbidden City]], the official imperial household of the Ming and Qing dynasties from 1420 until 1924, when the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] evicted [[Puyi]] from the Inner Court.]]
Departing from the main central administrative system generally known as the [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]] system, [[Government of the Han dynasty|which was instituted by various dynasties]] since late [[Han dynasty|Han]] (202 BCE – 220 CE), the Ming administration had only one Department, the Secretariat, that controlled the Six Ministries. Following the execution of the [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]] Hu Weiyong in 1380, the Hongwu Emperor abolished the Secretariat, the [[Censorate]], and the Chief Military Commission and personally took charge of the Six Ministries and the regional Five Military Commissions.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=28}}{{sfnp|Chang|2007|loc=p. 15, footnote 42}} Thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=28}} The [[Grand Secretariat]], at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork, was instituted, but without employing grand counselors, or [[Chancellor (China)|chancellors]].

The Hongwu Emperor sent his heir apparent to Shaanxi in 1391 to &quot;tour and soothe&quot; (''xunfu'') the region; in 1421 the Yongle Emperor commissioned 26 officials to travel the empire and uphold similar investigatory and patrimonial duties. By 1430 these ''xunfu'' assignments became institutionalized as &quot;[[grand coordinator]]s&quot;. Hence, the Censorate was reinstalled and first staffed with investigating censors, later with censors-in-chief. By 1453, the grand coordinators were granted the title vice censor-in-chief or assistant censor-in-chief and were allowed direct access to the emperor.{{sfnp|Chang|2007|p=16}} As in prior dynasties, the provincial administrations were monitored by a travelling inspector from the Censorate. Censors had the power to impeach officials on an irregular basis, unlike the senior officials who were to do so only in triennial evaluations of junior officials.{{sfnp|Chang|2007|p=16}}{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=16}}

Although decentralization of state power within the provinces occurred in the early Ming, the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the 1420s. By the late Ming dynasty, there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys, a system which reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=23}}

{{nihongo|'''''Gundam'''''|ガンダム|Gandamu|lead=yes}}, also known as the {{nihongo|'''''Gundam'' series'''|ガンダムシリーズ|Gandamu Shirīzu}}, is a Japanese [[military science fiction]] [[media franchise]]/[[media mix]] created by [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]] and [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] and, as of March 2020, indirectly fully owned by [[Bandai Namco Holdings]] through subsidiaries [[Sotsu]] and Sunrise. The franchise features giant robots ([[mecha]]) with the name &quot;Gundam&quot; (after the [[RX-78-2 Gundam|original titular mecha]]).  The franchise began on April 7, 1979 with ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'', a [[TV series]] that defined the &quot;[[real robot]]&quot; [[mecha anime]] genre by featuring giant robots called [[powered exoskeleton|mobile suit]]s in a militaristic setting.  The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes television series, [[Original Video Animation|OVA]]s, films, [[manga]], novels and video games, as well as a whole industry of [[plastic model|plastic model kits]] known as [[Gunpla]].

Gunpla makes up 90 percent of the Japanese character plastic-model market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081207100050/http://www3.jetro.go.jp/jetro-file/BodyUrlPdfDown.do?bodyurlpdf=05000892_001_BUP_0.pdf Flow of the Japan toy industry (日本の玩具産業の動向)], Japan Economics Department, Information section (日本経済情報課)&lt;/ref&gt; Academics in Japan have viewed the series as inspiration; in 2008, the virtual Gundam Academy was planned as the first academic institution based on an animated TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Leo|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gundam-cartoon-academy-to-turn-science-fiction-into-reality-in-japan-zffmrwsvwgj|title=Gundam cartoon academy to turn science fiction into reality in Japan|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=November 1, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Concept===
''Mobile Suit Gundam'' was developed by animator [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]] and a changing group of Sunrise creators with the collective pseudonym of [[Hajime Yatate]]. The series was originally entitled ''Freedom Fighter Gunboy'' (or ''Gunboy'') for the robot's gun, with teen boys the primary target demographic. Early production had a number of references to [[Freedom (political)|freedom]]: the [[White Base]] was originally &quot;Freedom's Fortress&quot;, the Core Fighter was the &quot;Freedom Wing&quot; and the Gunperry was the &quot;Freedom Cruiser&quot;. The Yatate team combined the English word &quot;gun&quot; with the last syllable of the word &quot;freedom&quot; to form the [[portmanteau]] ''Gundom''. Tomino changed it to ''Gundam'', suggesting a unit wielding a gun powerful enough to hold back enemies like a hydroelectric [[dam]] holding back water.&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Archives, production notes&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the concept, Gundams are depicted as prototypes or limited-production, with higher capabilities than mass-produced units.

Most Gundams are large, bipedal, [[humanoid]] vehicles controlled from a [[cockpit]] by a human pilot. The cockpit is located in the [[torso]], while the [[head]] serves as a camera to transmit images back to the cockpit. Most of the series protagonists are [[Newtypes]], genetically advanced humans adapted for space. Newtypes have [[extrasensory perception|psychic abilities]] that enable them to sense each other across space and to utilize special mobile suits.

The series itself has been described as a [[space opera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuckmann2018&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Stuckmann|title=Anime Impact: The Movies and Shows that Changed the World of Japanese Animation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFxZDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT42|date=15 May 2018|publisher=Mango Media Inc.|isbn=978-1-63353-733-0|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation===
''Mobile Suit Gundam'' reportedly pioneered the [[real robot]] subgenre of [[mecha anime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppliger&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2007/10/12/ask-john-which-gundam-series-have-had-the-most-impact-on-anime/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616111552/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2007/10/12/ask-john-which-gundam-series-have-had-the-most-impact-on-anime/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-06-16|title=Ask John: Which Gundam Series Have Had the Most Impact on Anime?|first=John|last=Oppliger|authorlink=AnimeNation#John Oppliger|date=2007-10-12|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=[[AnimeNation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike its [[super robot]] cousins, ''Mobile Suit Gundam'' attempted realism in its robot design and weaponry by running out of energy and ammunition or malfunctioning. Its technology is derived from actual science (such as [[Lagrange points]] and the [[O'Neill cylinder]] in space, and the use of [[Helium-3]] as an energy source) or feasible technology requiring only a few fictional elements to function (such as [[Minovsky Physics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Science, The High Frontier - G.K. O'neil's Space colonization plan, Gundam Century, Out Magazine special edition, Renewal Version&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Narrative}}Timelines===
Most of the ''Gundam'' animation (including the earliest series) is set in what is known as the Universal Century (UC) [[calendar era]], with later series set in alternate calendars or [[alternate future|timelines]]. Although many new Gundam stories are told in their parallel universe with independent timelines (giving them greater creative freedom), the original UC storyline continues to be popular. It established the series, setting the standard for [[hard science fiction]] in anime; the original ''Gundam'' marked the maturing of the giant-robot genre. Nostalgia for the oldest ''Gundam'' shows (and its status as a pop-culture icon in Japan) is a factor in its continuing success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhi.co.jp/news/sec1/020220nl.html] ''機動戦士ガンダムは、同じくバンダイグループの（株）サンライズが制作し、1979年4月～1980年1月にテレビシリーズ第１作が放映されて以来、テレビシリーズ8作品、劇場用映画9作品などが公開され、20年以上にわたり人気を保っています。米国をはじめ、ヨーロッパ、アジアでも作品が放映され、各地で高い人気を得ています。''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinoffs===
''[[SD Gundam]]'', a spinoff of ''Gundam'' which began during the mid-1980s, features [[super deformed]] designs and emphasizes comedy and adventure. ''[[Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G]]'', ''[[Gundam Build Fighters]]'', and ''[[Gundam Build Divers]]'' feature contemporary settings and use Gunpla as plot elements.

=={{anchor|Franchise}}Media==

===TV series, films, and video===
Except for ''Mobile Suit Gundam 00'', which follows the [[Common Era|current calendar era]], all Gundam series are set in a fictional era, begin after a drastic event or chain of events, and typically involve a major conflict between Earth and space colonies (and in some cases the Moon and [[Terraforming|terraformed]] planets). An exception is the ''Gundam Build'' timeline, which is set in an alternate present time where all other Gundam installments are fictional.

===Manga and novels===
{{Main|List of Gundam manga and novels}}

Manga adaptations of the ''Gundam'' series have been published in English in North America by a number of companies, such as [[Viz Media]], [[Del Rey Manga]] and [[Tokyopop]], and in [[Singapore]] by [[Chuang Yi]].

===Video games===
{{Main|List of Gundam video games}}
''Gundam'' has spawned over 80 video games for arcade, computer and console platforms, some with characters not found in other ''Gundam'' media. Some of the games, in turn inspired spinoff novels and manga. Most ''Gundam'' video games, except ''[[Dynasty Warriors: Gundam]]'', were released only in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/altjapan-co-ltd/list-games/|title=MobyGames: Game Browser|website=MobyGames|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Gundam model}}Gundam models===
{{Main|Gundam model}}
Hundreds of Gundam models, primarily made of plastic but sometimes with resin and metal detail parts, have been released. They range in quality from children's toy kits to hobbyist and museum-grade models, and most are in 1:35, 1:48, 1:60, 1:100 or 1:144 scale. Promotional 1:6 or 1:12 scale models are supplied to retailers and are not commercially available. For ''Gundam''{{'s}} 30th anniversary, a full-size RX-78-2 Gundam model was constructed and displayed at Gundam Front Tokyo, in the Odaiba district;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://appetiteforjapan.com/2015/12/02/gundam-odaiba/|title=Diver City Tokyo: the ultimate Gundam experience|last=appetiteforjapan|date=2015-12-02|website=Appetite For Japan|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was taken down on 5 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gundam.info/topic/17012|script-title=ja:「実物大ガンダム立像」5年の歴史に幕。そして新たなプロジェクトへ！|work=公式ガンダム情報ポータルサイト「GUNDAM.INFO」|access-date=2017-04-12|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new statue of the Unicorn Gundam was erected at the same location, now renamed The Gundam Base Tokyo.

===Other merchandise===
[[Bandai]], ''Gundam''{{'s}} primary licensee, produces a variety of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://na.gundam.info/index/white|title=GUNDAM.INFO {{!}} The official Gundam news and video portal|website=na.gundam.info|language=ja-JP|access-date=2016-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026105446/http://na.gundam.info/index/white|archive-date=2016-10-26|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies produce unofficial merchandise, such as toys, models and T-shirts. Products include Mobile Suit In Action (MSiA) action figures and Gundam model kits in several scales and design complexities. Each series generally has its own set of products, MSiA and model lines such as Master Grade and High Grade Universal Century may extend across series. The most popular action-figure line has been the Gundam Fix series, which includes the mecha in the animated series, manga and novels and accessories to create an updated version. In addition to Master Grade and High Grade Gundams, Bandai released a 30th-anniversary series of Gundam models in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suzuki|first=Toshiyuki|title=RX-78-2 Gundam (RG) (Gundam Model Kits)|url=http://www.1999.co.jp/eng/10115841|publisher=Hobby Search Co., Ltd.|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Real Grade (RG) Gundam series combined the Master Grade's detailed inner structure with additional colour separation, making the 1:144-scale series complex in design and compact in size. After the introduction of the RG Gundam series, Bandai released the Metal Build series in March 2011 (beginning with the 00 Gundam).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gundam metal build&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=METAL BUILD FREEDOM GUNDAM|url=http://www.gundamplanet.com/metal-build-freedom-gundam.html|publisher=Gundamplanet.com|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
Bandai maintains several websites to promote ''Gundam'' projects; Gundam Perfect Web is the official Japanese site. Its English-language counterpart is the US-maintained Gundam Official. In 2005, the website hosted the Gundam Official User Forum. The forum was based on the existing fan forum, Gundam Watch, using many of its staff. When the project was retired, Gundam Watch was reborn and became Gundam Evolution.

A number of series-specific websites have been created, often available for a limited time (usually to promote a [[DVD]] release). Common content includes character and mecha listings, lists of related merchandise and pay-for-download content. Special pages are frequent, often presenting downloadable wallpaper or a small game. The ''[[Superior Defender Gundam Force]]'' website has a game in which players take the role of villain Commander Sazabi, attempting to blast his subordinate with weapons.

'''Middle English''' (abbreviated to '''ME'''&lt;ref&gt;Simon Horobin, ''Introduction to Middle English'', Edinburgh 2016, s. 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a form of the [[English language]] spoken after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] (1066) until the late 15th century. English underwent distinct variations and developments following the [[Old English]] period. Scholarly opinion varies, but the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' specifies the period when Middle English was spoken as being from 1150 to 1500.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Middle English–an overview - Oxford English Dictionary|url = http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-time/middle-english-an-overview/|website = Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate = 2016-01-04|language = en-US|date = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stage of the development of the English language roughly followed the [[High Middle Ages|High]] to the [[Late Middle Ages]].

Middle English saw significant changes to its vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and [[orthography]]. Writing conventions during the Middle English period varied widely. Examples of writing from this period that have survived show extensive regional variation. The more standardized Old English language became fragmented, localized, and was, for the most part, being improvised.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; By the end of the period (about 1470) and aided by the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1439, a standard based on the London dialect (Chancery Standard) had become established. This largely formed the basis for Modern English spelling, although pronunciation has changed considerably since that time. Middle English was succeeded in England by the era of [[Early Modern English]], which lasted until about 1650. [[History of the Scots language|Scots]] developed concurrently from a variant of the [[Northumbrian dialect]] (prevalent in northern England and spoken in southeast [[Scotland]]).

During the Middle English period, many Old English grammatical features either became simplified or disappeared altogether. Noun, adjective and verb [[inflection]]s were simplified by the reduction (and eventual elimination) of most [[grammatical case]] distinctions. Middle English also saw considerable adoption of [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]] vocabulary, especially in the areas of politics, law, the arts, and religion, as well as poetic and emotive diction. Conventional English vocabulary remained primarily Germanic in its sources, with [[Old Norse]] influences becoming more apparent. Significant changes in pronunciation took place, particularly involving long vowels and diphthongs, which in the later Middle English period began to undergo the [[Great Vowel Shift]].

Little survives of early [[Middle English literature]], due in part to Norman domination and the prestige that came with writing in French rather than English. During the 14th century, a new style of literature emerged with the works of writers including [[John Wycliffe]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], whose ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' remains  the most studied and read work of the period.{{refn|The name &quot;tales of Canterbury&quot; appears within the surviving texts of Chaucer's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Carlson, David. |title= The Chronology of Lydgate's Chaucer References |journal= [[The Chaucer Review]] |volume=38 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=246–254 |doi=10.1353/cr.2004.0003 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.691.7778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==

===Transition from Old English===
[[File:Middle English Dialects.png|thumb|The dialects of Middle English c. 1300]]

Transition from Late [[Old English]] to Early Middle English occurred at some time during the 12th century.

The influence of [[Old Norse]] aided the development of English from a [[synthetic language]] with relatively free word order, to a more [[Analytic language|analytic]] or [[Isolating language|isolating]] language with a more strict word order.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Language|last = Baugh|first = Albert|publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|year = 1951|isbn = |location = London|pages = 110–130 (Danelaw); 131–132 (Normans)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Old English and Old Norse (as well as the descendants of the latter, [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]) were synthetic languages with complicated inflections. The eagerness of [[Vikings]] in the [[Danelaw]] to communicate with their Anglo-Saxon neighbours resulted in the erosion of inflection in both languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Growth and Structure of the English Language|last = Jespersen|first = Otto|publisher = B. G. Teubner|year = 1919|isbn = |location = Leipzig, Germany|pages = 58–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old Norse may have had a more profound impact on Middle and Modern English development than any other language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|url = https://archive.org/details/cambridgeencyclo00crys_012|url-access = limited|last = Crystal|first = David|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Cambridge, UK|pages = [https://archive.org/details/cambridgeencyclo00crys_012/page/n35 32]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Story of English|last = McCrum|first = Robert|publisher = Faber and Faber|year = 1987|isbn = |location = London|pages = 70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-OiNxknXdY|title = [BBC World News] BBC Documentary English Birth of a Language - 35:00 to 37:20|date = 27 December 2014|access-date = 12 January 2016|website = [BBC World News] BBC Documentary English Birth of a Language|publisher = BBC|last = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simeon Potter notes: &quot;No less far-reaching was the influence of Scandinavian upon the inflexional endings of English in hastening that wearing away and leveling of grammatical forms which gradually spread from north to south.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Our Language|url = https://archive.org/details/ourlanguage00pott|url-access = registration|last = Potter|first = Simeon|publisher = Penguin|year = 1950|isbn = |location = Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|pages = [https://archive.org/details/ourlanguage00pott/page/33 33]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viking influence on [[Old English]] is most apparent in the more indispensable elements of the language. Pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal adverbs (like &quot;hence&quot; and &quot;together&quot;), conjunctions and prepositions show the most marked Danish influence. The best evidence of Scandinavian influence appears in extensive word borrowings, yet no texts exist in either Scandinavia or in Northern England from this period to give certain evidence of an influence on syntax. The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Like close cousins, Old Norse and Old English resembled each other, and with some words in common, they roughly understood each other;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adngAZ2iuRc|title = 121028 Charlene Lohmeier &quot;Evolution of the English Language&quot; - 23:40 - 25:00; 30:20 - 30:45; 45:00 - 46:00|date = 28 October 2012|access-date = 12 January 2016|website = 121028 Charlene Lohmeier &quot;Evolution of the English Language&quot;|publisher = Dutch Lichliter|last = Lohmeier|first = Charlene}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most &quot;important to recognise that in many words the English and Scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements. The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost.&quot; This blending of peoples and languages happily resulted in &quot;simplifying English grammar.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

While the influence of Scandinavian languages was strongest in the dialects of the [[Danelaw]] region and Scotland, words in the spoken language emerge in the tenth and eleventh centuries near the transition from the Old to Middle English. Influence on the written language only appeared at the beginning of the thirteenth century, likely because of a scarcity of literary texts from an earlier date.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

The [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 saw the replacement of the top levels of the English-speaking political and ecclesiastical hierarchies by [[Normans|Norman]] rulers who spoke a dialect of [[Old French]] known as [[Old Norman]], which developed in England into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. The use of Norman as the preferred language of literature and polite discourse fundamentally  altered the role of Old English in education and administration, even though many Normans of this period were illiterate and depended on the clergy for written communication and record-keeping. A significant number of words of French origin began to appear in the English language alongside native English words of similar meaning, giving rise to such Modern English synonyms as ''[[pig]]/[[pork]], [[chicken]]/[[poultry]], [[calf (animal)|calf]]/[[veal]], [[cow]]/[[beef]], [[sheep]]/[[mutton]], wood/[[forest]], house/[[mansion]], worthy/valuable, bold/courageous, freedom/[[liberty]], sight/vision, eat/dine''.
The role of Anglo-Norman as the language of government and law can be seen in the abundance of Modern English words for the mechanisms of government that are derived from Anglo-Norman: ''[[court]]'', ''[[judge]]'', ''[[jury]]'', ''[[appeal]]'', ''[[parliament]]''. There are also many Norman-derived terms relating to the [[chivalric]] cultures that arose in the 12th century; an era of [[feudalism]] and [[crusading]].

Words were often taken from [[Latin]], usually through French transmission. This gave rise to various synonyms including ''kingly'' (inherited from Old English), ''royal'' (from French, which inherited it from Vulgar Latin), and ''regal'' (from French, which borrowed it from classical Latin). Later French appropriations were derived from standard, rather than Norman, French. Examples of resultant cognate pairs include the words ''warden'' (from Norman), and ''guardian'' (from later French; both share a common Germanic ancestor).

The end of Anglo-Saxon rule did not result in immediate changes to the language. The general population would have spoken the same [[Old English dialects|dialects]] as they had before the Conquest. Once the writing of Old English came to an end, Middle English had no standard language, only dialects that derived from the [[Old English dialects|dialects of the same regions]] in the Anglo-Saxon period.

===Early Middle English===
Early Middle English (1150–1300)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fuster-Márquez |first1=Miguel |last2=Calvo García de Leonardo |first2=Juan José |year=2011 |title=A Practical Introduction to the History of English |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQLBqKjxuvAC&amp;q=%22ca+1150+and+1500%22&amp;pg=PA21 |location=[València] |publisher=Universitat de València |page=21 |isbn=9788437083216 |access-date=19 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a largely Anglo-Saxon vocabulary (with [[Scandinavian influence in English|many Norse borrowings]] in the northern parts of the country), but a greatly simplified [[inflection]]al system. The grammatical relations that were expressed in Old English by the [[dative]] and [[instrumental case]]s are replaced in Early Middle English with [[preposition]]al constructions. The Old English [[genitive]] ''-es'' survives in the ''-'s'' of the modern [[English possessive]], but most of the other case endings disappeared in the Early Middle English period, including most of the [[Old English declension#Definite articles and demonstratives|roughly one dozen forms]] of the [[definite article]] (&quot;the&quot;). The [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] personal pronouns (denoting exactly two) also disappeared from English during this period.

Gradually, the wealthy and the government [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] again, although Norman (and subsequently [[Law French|French]]) remained the dominant language of literature and law until the 14th century, even after the loss of the majority of the continental possessions of the [[English monarchy]]. The loss of case endings was part of a general trend from inflections to fixed [[word order]] that also occurred in other Germanic languages (though more slowly and to a lesser extent), and therefore it cannot be attributed simply to the influence of French-speaking sections of the population: English did, after all, remain the [[vernacular]]. It is also argued&lt;ref&gt;McWhorter, ''Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue,'' 2008, pp. 89–136.&lt;/ref&gt; that Norse immigrants to England had a great impact on the loss of inflectional endings in Middle English. One argument is that, although Norse- and English-speakers were somewhat comprehensible to each other due to similar morphology, the Norse-speakers' inability to reproduce the ending sounds of English words influenced Middle English's loss of inflectional endings.

Important texts for the reconstruction of the evolution of Middle English out of Old English are the ''[[Peterborough Chronicle]]'', which continued to be compiled up to 1154; the ''[[Ormulum]]'', a biblical commentary probably composed in [[Lincolnshire]] in the second half of the 12th century, incorporating a unique phonetic spelling system; and the ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'' and the [[Katherine Group]], religious texts written for [[anchoress]]es, apparently in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in the early 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Burchfield |first=Robert W. |chapter=Ormulum |editor-first=Joseph R. |editor-last=Strayer |title=Dictionary of the Middle Ages |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=1987 |volume=9 |page=280 |isbn=978-0-684-18275-9 }}, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; The language found in the last two works is sometimes called the [[AB language]].

More literary sources of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries include ''[[Layamon's Brut|Lawman's Brut]]'' and ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]''.

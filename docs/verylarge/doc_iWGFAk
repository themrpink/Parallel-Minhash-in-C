Connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase to establish the parameters of communication before any packet is transferred. The [[signaling (telecommunications)|signaling]] protocols used for setup allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters. Acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated. The packets transferred may include a connection identifier rather than address information and the packet header can be smaller, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets. In this case, address information is only transferred to each node during the connection setup phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. When a connection identifier is used, routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection identifier in a table. 

Connection-oriented transport layer protocols such as TCP provide a connection-oriented service by using an underlying connectionless network. In this case, the [[end-to-end principle]] dictates that the end nodes, not the network itself, are responsible for the connection-oriented behavior.

==Packet switching in networks==
Packet switching is used to optimize the use of the [[channel capacity]] available in digital telecommunication networks, such as computer networks, and minimize the transmission [[latency (engineering)|latency]] (the time it takes for data to pass across the network), and to increase [[robustness (computer science)|robustness]] of communication.

Packet switching is used in the [[Internet]] and most [[local area network]]s. The Internet is implemented by the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] using a variety of [[Link Layer]] technologies. For example, [[Ethernet]] and [[Frame Relay]] are common. Newer [[mobile phone]] technologies (e.g., [[GSM]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]) also use packet switching. Packet switching is associated with connectionless networking because, in these systems, no connection agreement needs to be established between communicating parties prior to exchanging data. 

[[X.25]] is a notable use of packet switching in that, despite being based on packet switching methods, it provides [[virtual circuit]]s to the user. These virtual circuits carry variable-length packets. In 1978, X.25 provided the first international and commercial packet switching network, the [[International Packet Switched Service]] (IPSS). [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) also is a virtual circuit technology, which uses fixed-length [[cell relay]] connection oriented packet switching.

Technologies such as [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]] (MPLS) and the [[Resource Reservation Protocol]] (RSVP) create virtual circuits on top of datagram networks. MPLS and its predecessors, as well as ATM, have been called &quot;fast packet&quot; technologies. MPLS, indeed, has been called &quot;ATM without cells&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.certificationzone.com/cisco/newsletter/SL/interview_08-12-03.html Interview with the author (of an MPLS-based VPN article)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929150800/http://www.certificationzone.com/cisco/newsletter/SL/interview_08-12-03.html |date=2007-09-29 }}, G. Pildush&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual circuits are especially useful in building robust failover mechanisms and allocating bandwidth for delay-sensitive applications.

{{Further|History of the Internet}}
The history of packet-switched networks can be divided into three overlapping eras: early networks before the introduction of [[X.25]] and the [[OSI model]], the X.25 era when many [[postal, telegraph and telephone service|postal, telephone, and telegraph]] companies used networks with X.25 interfaces, and the [[Internet]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Roger D.|title=This is a temporary index for a collection of papers about packet-switching in the 1970s|url=http://rogerdmoore.ca/PS/|access-date=5 September 2017|date=August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirstein|first1=Peter T.|title=A SURVEY OF PRESENT AMD PLANNED GENERAL PURPOSE EUROPEAN DATA AND COMPUTER NETWORKS|url=http://rogerdmoore.ca/PS/Kirs1973/Ki.html|access-date=5 September 2017|date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=National Research Council (U.S.).

===Early networks===
Research into packet switching at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) began with a proposal for a wide-area network in 1965,&lt;ref name=Roberts1978&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Dr. Lawrence G.|title=The Evolution of Packet Switching|url=http://www.packet.cc/files/ev-packet-sw.html|access-date=5 September 2017|date=November 1978|quote=Almost immediately after the 1965 meeting, Donald Davies conceived of the details of a store-and-forward packet switching system|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324033133/http://www.packet.cc/files/ev-packet-sw.html|archive-date=24 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a local-area network in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A SURVEY OF THE CAPABILITIES OF 8 PACKET SWITCHING NETWORKS|url=http://rogerdmoore.ca/PS/Wood.html|date=1975|access-date=5 September 2017|quote=Research in packet switching networks at the British National Physical Laboratory (NPL) predates ARPANET, having commenced in 1966.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARPANET funding was secured in 1966 by [[Robert Taylor (computer scientist)|Bob Taylor]], and planning began in 1967 when he hired [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Larry Roberts]]. The NPL network, ARPANET, and SITA HLN became operational in 1969. Before the introduction of X.25 in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; about twenty different network technologies had been developed. Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core. In the datagram system, operating according to the [[end-to-end principle]], the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets. In the [[virtual call capability|virtual call]] system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host. This results in a simpler host interface but complicates the network. The X.25 protocol suite uses this network type.

===={{anchor|Appletalk}}AppleTalk====
[[AppleTalk]] is a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in 1985 for [[Apple Macintosh]] computers. It was the primary protocol used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 1990s. AppleTalk included features that allowed [[local area network]]s to be established ''ad hoc'' without the requirement for a centralized router or server. The AppleTalk system automatically assigned addresses, updated the distributed namespace, and configured any required [[Internetworking|inter-network routing]]. It was a [[plug-n-play]] system.&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer&gt;[http://www.opendoor.com/nethistory/MacWorld2004/index.html &quot;A History of Macintosh Networking&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016132614/http://www.opendoor.com/nethistory/MacWorld2004/index.html |date=2006-10-16 }}, Alan Oppenheimer, MacWorld Expo, January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Inside AppleTalk, Second Edition'', Gursharan Sidhu, Richard Andrews and Alan Oppenheiner, Addison-Wesley, 1989, {{ISBN|0-201-55021-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AppleTalk implementations were also released for the [[IBM PC]] and compatibles, and the [[Apple IIGS]]. AppleTalk support was available in most networked printers, especially [[laser printer]]s, some [[file server]]s and [[router (computing)|router]]s. AppleTalk support was terminated in 2009, replaced by [[TCP/IP]] protocols.&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer/&gt;

====ARPANET====
The [[ARPANET]] was a progenitor network of the Internet and one of the first networks, along with ARPA's [[SATNET]], to run the [[TCP/IP]] suite using packet switching technologies.

====BNRNET====
BNRNET was a network which [[Bell-Northern Research]] developed for internal use. It initially had only one host but was designed to support many hosts. BNR later made major contributions to the CCITT [[X.25]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

====CYCLADES====
The [[CYCLADES]] packet switching network was a French research network designed and directed by [[Louis Pouzin]]. First demonstrated in 1973, it was developed to explore alternatives to the early ARPANET design and to support network research generally. It was the first network to use the [[end-to-end principle]] and make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data, rather than the network itself. Concepts of this network influenced later ARPANET architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/chris/think/Cyclades/index.shtml|title=A Technical History of CYCLADES|work=Technical Histories of the Internet &amp; other Network Protocols|publisher=Computer Science Department, University of Texas Austin|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901092641/http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/chris/think/Cyclades/index.shtml|archive-date=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

====DECnet====
[[DECnet]] is a suite of network protocols created by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], originally released in 1975 in order to connect two [[PDP-11]] [[minicomputers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/dec/dec.digital_1957_to_the_present_(1978).1957-1978.102630349.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630025909/http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/dec/dec.digital_1957_to_the_present_(1978).1957-1978.102630349.pdf |archive-date=2017-06-30 |title=Digital Equipment Corporation, Nineteen Fifty-Seven to the Present |publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation |date=1978 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; It evolved into one of the first [[peer-to-peer]] network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with three [[Abstraction layer|layers]], it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI]]-compliant networking protocol. The DECnet protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation. However, DECnet Phase II (and later) were [[open standard]]s with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including one for [[Linux]].

====GEIS====
As General Electric Information Services (GEIS), [[General Electric]] was a major international provider of information services. The company originally designed a telephone network to serve as its internal (albeit continent-wide) voice telephone network.

In 1965, at the instigation of Warner Sinback, a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect GE's four computer sales and service centers (Schenectady, New York, Chicago, and Phoenix) to facilitate a computer time-sharing service.

After going international some years later, GEIS created a network data center near [[Cleveland]], Ohio. Very little has been published about the internal details of their network. The design was hierarchical with redundant communication links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schwartz |first= Mischa |author2=Boorstyn, Rober R. |author3=Pickholtz, Raymond L. |title= Terminal-Oriented Computer-Communication Networks |journal= Proceedings of the IEEE |volume= 60 |issue= 11 |pages= 1408–23 |date= November 1972 |url= http://rogerdmoore.ca/PS/TONET/TON.html#GEISCO |doi=10.1109/proc.1972.8912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= Peter T. |last= Kirstein |title= A SURVEY OF PRESENT AND PLANNED GENERAL PURPOSE EUROPEAN DATA AND COMPUTER NETWORKS |book-title= Proceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Computer Communication Networks |publisher= Noordhoff International Publishing |location= Sussex, United Kingdom |year=1973 |url= http://rogerdmoore.ca/PS/Kirs1973/Ki.html#GEISCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====RCP====
RCP was an experimental network created by the French PTT. It was used to gain experience with packet switching technology before the specification of [[Transpac (network)|TRANSPAC]] was frozen&lt;ref name=&quot;Transpac choices&quot;/&gt;. RCP was a [[virtual circuit|virtual-circuit]] network in contrast to CYCLADES which was based on [[datagram]]s. RCP emphasised terminal-to-host and terminal-to-terminal connection; CYCLADES was concerned with host-to-host communication. [[Transpac (network)|TRANSPAC]] was introduced as an X.25 network. RCP influenced the specification of [[X.25]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= R. |last= Després |author-link= Rémi Després |title= RCP, THE EXPERIMENTAL PACKET-SWITCHED DATA TRANSMISSION SERVICE OF THE FRENCH PTT |book-title= Proceedings of ICCC 74 |pages= 171–85 |year= 1974 |url= http://rogerdmoore.ca/PS/RCPDEP/RD.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= A. |last= Bache |author2=Matras, Y. |title= Fundamental Choices in the Development of RCP, the Experimental Packet-Switching Data Transmission Service of the French PTT |book-title= Proceedings of ICCC 76 |pages= 311–16 |year= 1976 |url= http://rogerdmoore.ca/PS/RCPBAC/RB.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= A. |last= Bache |author2=L.

====RETD====
Red Especial de Transmisión de Datos was a network developed by Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España. It became operational in 1972 and thus was the first public network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= G. |last= Alarcia |author2=Herrera, S. |title= C.T.N.E.'s PACKET SWITCHING NETWORK.

====SCANNET====
&quot;The experimental packet-switched Nordic telecommunication network SCANNET was implemented in Nordic technical libraries in the 1970s, and it included first Nordic electronic journal Extemplo. Libraries were also among first ones in universities to accommodate microcomputers for public use in the early 1980s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/conferences/eunis2001/e/Haarala/HTML/haarala-ch2.html |title= Libraries as key players at the local level |first= Arja-Riitta |last= Haarala|doi= 10.18452/1040 |year= 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SITA HLN====
[[SITA (IT company)|SITA]] is a consortium of airlines. Its High Level Network became operational in 1969 at about the same time as ARPANET. It carried interactive traffic and message-switching traffic. As with many non-academic networks, very little has been published about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= G.J. |last= Chretien |author2=Konig, W.M. |author3=Rech, J.H. |title= The SITA Network |url= http://rogerdmoore.ca/PS/SITAB.html |book-title= Proceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Computer Communication Networks |publisher= Noordhoff International Publishing |location= Sussex, United Kingdom |pages= 373–396 |year= 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Systems Network Architecture====
[[Systems Network Architecture]] (SNA) is [[IBM]]'s proprietary networking architecture created in 1974. An IBM customer could acquire hardware and software from IBM and lease private lines from a common carrier to construct a private network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= R.J. |last= Sundstrom |author2=G.D.

====Telenet====
[[Telenet]] was the first FCC-licensed [[public data network]] in the United States. Telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975. It was founded by [[Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman]] with [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Larry Roberts]] as CEO as a means of making packet switching technology public. He had tried to interest AT&amp;T in buying the technology, but the monopoly's reaction was that this was incompatible with their future. It initially used ARPANET technology but changed the host interface to X.25 and the terminal interface to X.29. It went public in 1979 and was then sold to GTE.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Electronic post for switching data&quot;. Timothy Johnson. New Scientist. May 13, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathison, S.L.

====Tymnet====
[[Tymnet]] was an international data communications network headquartered in San Jose, CA that utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used X.25, SNA/SDLC, BSC and ASCII interfaces to connect host computers (servers) at thousands of large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. Users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections. The business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies (mostly banks and airlines) to build their own dedicated networks. The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network. Tymnet was also connected to dozens of other public networks in the U.S. and internationally via X.25/X.75 gateways. (Interesting note: Tymnet was not named after Mr. Tyme. Another employee suggested the name.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last= TYMES |first= LA ROY W. |title= TYMNET &amp;mdash; A terminal oriented communication network |book-title= Proceedings of the SJCC 1971 |volume= 38 |pages= 211–16 |url= http://rogerdmoore.ca/PS/TYMNET/TY.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= TYMES |first= LA ROY W. |title= Routing and Flow Control in TYMNET

====XNS====
[[Xerox Network Systems]] (XNS) was a [[protocol suite]] promulgated by [[Xerox]], which provided [[routing]] and packet delivery, as well as higher level functions such as a [[reliable stream]], and [[remote procedure call]]s. It was developed from [[PARC Universal Packet]] (PUP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.msgilligan.com/2012/07/xerox-system-integration-standard.html ''Xerox System Integration Standard - Internet Transport Protocols''], Xerox, Stamford, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ics.upjs.sk/~novotnyr/home/programovanie/c/books/cpc/ch12_xns.htm &quot;Chapter 12: Xerox Network Systems&quot;], ''AIX Version 4.3 Communications Programming Concepts'', International Business Machines, October 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===X.25 era===
{{See also|Public data network}}
There were two kinds of X.25 networks. Some such as [[DATAPAC]] and [[Transpac (network)|TRANSPAC]] were initially implemented with an X.25 external interface. Some older networks such as TELENET and TYMNET were modified to provide a X.25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes. DATAPAC was developed by Bell Northern Research which was a joint venture of [[Bell Canada]] (a common carrier) and [[Northern Telecom]] (a telecommunications equipment supplier). Northern Telecom sold several DATAPAC clones to foreign PTTs including the [[Deutsche Bundespost]]. [[X.75]] and [[X.121]] allowed the interconnection of national X.25 networks. A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the DNIC of the remote network as part of the destination address.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

====AUSTPAC====
[[AUSTPAC]] was an Australian public X.25 network operated by [[Telstra]]. Started by [[Telecom Australia]] in the early 1980s, AUSTPAC was Australia's first public packet-switched data network, supporting applications such as on-line betting, financial applications—the [[Australian Tax Office]] made use of AUSTPAC—and remote terminal access to academic institutions, who maintained their connections to AUSTPAC up until the mid-late 1990s in some cases. Access can be via a dial-up terminal to a [[Packet Assembler/Disassembler|PAD]], or, by linking a permanent X.25 node to the network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew Colley&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/telstra-drops-austpac-reaches-for-finance-market/ | title=Telstra drops Austpac; reaches for finance market | date=28 January 2004 | access-date=21 December 2018 | author= Andrew Colley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ConnNet====
[[ConnNet]] was a packet-switched data network operated by the Southern New England Telephone Company serving the state of Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ufUXLhZHLoC&amp;q=ConnEct+was+a+packet-switched+data+network+operated+by+the+Southern+New+England+Telephone+Company+serving+the+state+of+Connecticut&amp;pg=PA40|title=Straight To The Point - Networking|last=Maidasani|first=Dinesh|date=June 2009|publisher=Laxmi Publications Pvt Limited|isbn=9788131805299}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

====Datanet 1====
Datanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] PTT Telecom (now known as [[KPN]]). Strictly speaking Datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via [[leased line]]s (using the [[X.121]] DNIC 2041), the name also referred to the public [[Packet Assembler/Disassembler|PAD]] service ''Telepad'' (using the DNIC 2049). And because the main [[Videotex]] service used the network and modified [[Packet Assembler/Disassembler|PAD]] devices as [[infrastructure]] the name Datanet 1 was used for these services as well. Although this use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of [[KPN]] contributed to the confusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;dn1descr&quot;&gt;H.J.

====Euronet====
Nine member states of the [[European Economic Community]] contracted with [[Logica]] and the French company SESA to set up a joint venture in 1975 to undertake the ''Euronet'' development, using X.25 protocols to form virtual circuits. It was to replace EIN and established a network in 1979 linking a number of European countries until 1984 when the network was handed over to national PTTs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Origins, development and future of the Euronet|date=1977-12-31|publisher=Emeraldinsight.com|doi=10.1108/eb046759|last1 = Dunning|first1 = A.J.|journal = Program|volume = 11|issue = 4|pages = 145–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerssens|first=Niels|title=Rethinking legacies in internet history: Euronet, lost (inter)networks, EU politics|journal=Internet Histories|volume=0|pages=32–48|doi=10.1080/24701475.2019.1701919|issn=2470-1475|year=2020|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HIPA-NET====
[[Hitachi]] designed a private network system for sale as a turnkey package to multi-national organizations. In addition to providing X.25 packet switching, message switching software was also included. Messages were buffered at the nodes adjacent to the sending and receiving terminals. Switched virtual calls were not supported, but through the use of &quot;logical ports&quot; an originating terminal could have a menu of pre-defined destination terminals.

[[Iberpac]] is the Spanish public packet-switched network, providing X.25 services. Iberpac is run by [[Telefonica]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

====IPSS====
In 1978, X.25 provided the first international and commercial packet switching network, the [[International Packet Switched Service]] (IPSS).

====JANET====
[[JANET]] was the UK academic and research network, linking all universities, higher education establishments, publicly funded research laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1984-2014: 30 years of the Janet network|url=https://www.jisc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/janet-news-24-pull-out-april-2014.pdf|publisher=Disc|access-date=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The X.25 network, which used the [[Coloured Book protocols]], was based mainly on [[GEC 4000 series]] switches, and run X.25 links at up to 8 Mbit/s in its final phase before being converted to an IP based network. The JANET network grew out of the 1970s SRCnet, later called SERCnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Mike|date=1988-11-01|title=JANET-the United Kingdom Joint Academic Network|journal=Serials|language=en|volume=1|issue=3|pages=28–36|doi=10.1629/010328|issn=1475-3308|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PSS====
[[Packet Switch Stream]] (PSS) was the UK Post Office (later to become British Telecom) national X.25 network with a DNIC of 2342. British Telecom renamed PSS under its GNS (Global Network Service) name, but the PSS name has remained better known. PSS also included public dial-up PAD access, and various InterStream gateways to other services such as Telex.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

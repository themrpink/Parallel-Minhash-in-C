The Narentines took more liberties in their raiding quests while the Venetian Navy was abroad, as when it was campaigning in Sicilian waters in 827–882. As soon as the Venetian fleet would return to the Adriatic, the Narentines temporarily abandoned their habits again, even signing a Treaty in Venice and baptising their Slavic pagan leader into Christianity. In 834 or 835 they broke the treaty and again they raided Venetian traders returning from Benevento, and all of Venice's military attempts to punish them in 839 and 840 utterly failed. Later, they raided the Venetians more often, together with the [[Arabs]]. In 846, the Narentines broke through to Venice itself and raided its lagoon city of [[Caorle]]. This caused a Byzantine military action against them that finally brought Christianity to them. After the [[Caliphate|Arab]] raids on the [[Adriatic coast]] circa 872 and the retreat of the Imperial Navy, the Narentines continued their raids of Venetian waters, causing new conflicts with the Italians in 887–888. The Venetians futilely continued to fight them throughout the 10th and 11th centuries.

In 937, Irish pirates sided with the Scots, Vikings, [[Picts]], and Welsh in their invasion of England. [[Athelstan]] drove them back.

The [[Baltic Slavic piracy|Slavic piracy]] in the Baltic Sea ended with the Danish conquest of the [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]] stronghold of [[Cape Arkona|Arkona]] in 1168. In the 12th century the coasts of western Scandinavia were plundered by [[Curonians]] and [[Oeselians]] from the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. In the 13th and 14th century, pirates threatened the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] routes and nearly brought sea trade to the brink of extinction. The [[Victual Brothers]] of [[Gotland]] were a companionship of privateers who later turned to piracy as the [[Victual Brothers#Likedeelers, successors of Victual Brothers|Likedeelers]]. They were especially noted for their leaders [[Klaus Störtebeker]] and [[Gödeke Michels]]. Until about 1440, maritime trade in both the [[North Sea]], the Baltic Sea and the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] was seriously in danger of attack by the pirates.

H. Thomas Milhorn mentions a certain Englishman named William Maurice, convicted of piracy in 1241, as the first person known to have been [[hanged, drawn and quartered]],&lt;ref&gt;H Thomas Milhorn, ''Crime: Computer Viruses to Twin Towers'', Universal Publishers, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58112-489-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which would indicate that the then-ruling King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] took an especially severe view of this crime.

The [[ushkuiniks]] were [[Novgorod]]ian pirates who looted the cities on the [[Volga]] and [[Kama]] Rivers in the 14th century.

As early as [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, the [[Maniots]] (one of Greece's toughest populations) were known as pirates. The Maniots considered piracy as a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor and it became their main source of income. The main victims of Maniot pirates were the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] but the Maniots also targeted ships of European countries.

[[Zaporizhian Sich]] was a pirate republic in Europe from the 16th through to the 18th century. Situated in [[Cossacks|Cossack]] territory in the remote [[Eurasian Steppe|steppe]] of [[Eastern Europe]], it was populated with Ukrainian peasants that had run away from their feudal masters, outlaws, destitute gentry, run-away slaves from Turkish [[galleys]], etc. The remoteness of the place and the rapids at the [[Dnieper]] river effectively guarded the place from invasions of vengeful powers. The main target of the inhabitants of Zaporizhian Sich who called themselves &quot;Cossacks&quot; were rich settlements at the Black Sea shores of Ottoman Empire and [[Crimean Khanate]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} By 1615 and 1625, [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] had even managed to raze townships on the outskirts of [[Istanbul]], forcing the [[Ottoman Sultan]] to flee his palace.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} [[Don Cossacks]] under [[Stenka Razin]] even ravaged the Persian coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cindyvallar.com/razin.html|title=Pirates &amp; Privateers: The History of Maritime Piracy |author=Stepan Razin|website=www.cindyvallar.com|access-date=August 28, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805222255/http://www.cindyvallar.com/razin.html|archive-date=August 5, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=November 2015}}

[[File:A French Ship and Barbary Pirates (c 1615) by Aert Anthoniszoon.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|French ship under attack by Barbary pirates, ca. 1615]]
Though less famous and romanticized than Atlantic or Caribbean pirates, corsairs in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] equaled or outnumbered the former at any given point in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Earle 2003, p. 89&quot;&gt;Earle (2003), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Mediterranean piracy was conducted almost entirely with galleys until the mid-17th century, when they were gradually replaced with highly maneuverable sailing vessels such as [[xebec]]s and [[brigantine]]s. They were, however, of a smaller type than battle galleys, often referred to as [[galiot]]s or [[fusta]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), pp. 217–19&lt;/ref&gt; Pirate galleys were small, nimble, lightly armed, but often heavily manned in order to overwhelm the often minimal crews of merchant ships. In general, pirate craft were extremely difficult for patrolling craft to actually hunt down and capture. [[Anne Hilarion de Tourville]], a French admiral of the 17th century, believed that the only way to run down raiders from the infamous corsair Moroccan port of [[Salé]] was by using a captured pirate vessel of the same type.&lt;ref&gt;Earle (2003), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Using oared vessels to combat pirates was common, and was even practiced by the major powers in the Caribbean. Purpose-built galleys (or hybrid sailing vessels) were built by the English in Jamaica in 1683&lt;ref&gt;Earle (2003), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Spanish in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (2000), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Specially-built sailing frigates with oar-ports on the lower decks, like the ''James Galley'' and ''[[HMS Charles Galley (1676)|Charles Galley]]'', and oar-equipped sloops proved highly useful for pirate hunting, though they were not built in sufficient numbers to check piracy until the 1720s.&lt;ref&gt;Earle (2003), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of Muslim power through the Ottoman conquest of large parts of the eastern Mediterranean in the 15th and 16th century resulted in extensive piracy on sea trading. The so-called [[Barbary pirates]] began to operate out of North African ports in Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, Morocco around 1500, preying primarily on the shipping of Christian powers, including massive slave raids at sea as well as on land. The Barbary pirates were nominally under Ottoman [[suzerainty]], but had considerable independence to prey on the enemies of Islam. The Muslim corsairs were technically often privateers with support from legitimate, though highly belligerent, states. They considered themselves as holy Muslim warriors, or [[ghazi (warrior)|ghazis]],&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; carrying on the tradition of fighting the incursion of Western Christians that had begun with the [[First Crusade]] late in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Earle 2003, pp. 39-52&quot;&gt;Earle (2003), pp. 39–52&lt;/ref&gt;

Coastal villages and towns of Italy, Spain and [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|islands in the Mediterranean]] were frequently attacked by Muslim corsairs and long stretches of the Italian and Spanish coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants; after 1600 the Barbary corsairs occasionally entered the Atlantic and struck as far north as Iceland. According to Robert Davis between 1&amp;nbsp;million and 1.25&amp;nbsp;million Europeans were captured by Barbary corsairs and sold as [[Arab slave trade|slaves]] in North Africa and the [[Ottoman Empire]] between the 16th and 19th centuries. The most famous corsairs were the Ottoman [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hayreddin]] and his older brother [[Oruç Reis]] (Redbeard), [[Turgut Reis]] (known as Dragut in the West), [[Kurtoglu Muslihiddin Reis|Kurtoglu]] (known as Curtogoli in the West), [[Kemal Reis]], [[Salih Reis]] and [[Murat Reis the Older|Koca Murat Reis]]. A few Barbary corsairs, such as the Dutch [[Jan Janszoon]] and the English [[John Ward (pirate)|John Ward]] (Muslim name Yusuf Reis), were renegade European privateers who had converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm|title=When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220038/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm|archive-date=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5q9zcB3JS40C&amp;pg=PR14 Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500–1800]''&quot;.

The Barbary pirates had a direct Christian counterpart in the military order of the [[Knights of Saint John]] that operated out first out of [[Rhodes]] and after 1530 [[Malta]]), though they were less numerous and took fewer slaves. Both sides waged war against the respective enemies of their faith, and both used galleys as their primary weapons. Both sides also used captured or bought [[galley slave]]s to man the oars of their ships; the Muslims relying mostly on captured Christians, the Christians using a mix of Muslim slaves, Christian convicts and a small contingency of ''buonavoglie'', free men who out of desperation or poverty had taken to rowing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Earle 2003, pp. 39-52&quot;/&gt;

Historian Peter Earle has described the two sides of the Christian-Muslim Mediterranean conflict as &quot;mirror image[s] of maritime predation, two businesslike fleets of plunderers set against each other&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Earle (2003), pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict of faith in the form of privateering, piracy and slave raiding generated a complex system that was upheld/financed/operated on the trade in plunder and slaves that was generated from a low-intensive conflict, as well as the need for protection from violence. The system has been described as a &quot;massive, multinational protection racket&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Earle (2003), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; the Christian side of which was not ended until 1798 in the Napoleonic Wars. The Barbary corsairs were finally quelled as late as the 1830s, effectively ending the last vestiges of counter-crusading [[jihad]].&lt;ref&gt;Earle (2003), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Amaro Pargo.jpg|thumb|[[Amaro Rodríguez Felipe|Amaro Pargo]] was one of the most famous corsairs of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]]]]
Piracy off the [[Barbary coast]] was often assisted by competition among European powers in the 17th century. France encouraged the corsairs against Spain, and later Britain and Holland supported them against France. However, by the second half of the 17th century the greater European naval powers began to initiate reprisals to intimidate the Barbary States into making peace with them. The most successful of the Christian states in dealing with the corsair threat was England.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} From the 1630s onwards England had signed peace treaties with the Barbary States on various occasions, but invariably breaches of these agreements led to renewed wars. A particular bone of contention was the tendency of foreign ships to pose as English to avoid attack. However, growing English naval power and increasingly persistent operations against the corsairs proved increasingly costly for the Barbary States. During the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] a series of English expeditions won victories over raiding squadrons and mounted attacks on their home ports which permanently ended the Barbary threat to English shipping. In 1675 a bombardment from a [[Royal Navy]] squadron led by [[John Narborough|Sir John Narborough]] and further defeats at the hands of a squadron under [[Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington|Arthur Herbert]] negotiated a lasting peace (until 1816) with Tunis and Tripoli.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

France, which had recently emerged as a leading naval power, achieved comparable success soon afterwards, with bombardments of Algiers in 1682, 1683 and 1688 securing a lasting peace, while Tripoli was similarly coerced in 1686. In 1783 and 1784 the Spaniards also bombarded [[Algiers]] in an effort to stem the piracy. The [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)|second time]], [[Antonio Barceló|Admiral Barceló]] damaged the city so severely that the Algerian [[Dey]] asked [[Spain]] to negotiate a peace treaty and from then on Spanish vessels and coasts were safe for several years.

Until the American [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] treaties with the [[Northwest Africa|North African]] states protected American ships from the [[Barbary Coast|Barbary]] corsairs. [[Morocco]], which in 1777 was [[Moroccan–American Treaty of Friendship|the first independent nation to publicly recognize the United States]], became in 1784 the first Barbary power to seize an American vessel after independence. While the United States managed to secure peace treaties, these obliged it to pay tribute for protection from attack. Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of United States government annual expenditures in 1800,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oren|first=Michael B.|title=The Middle East and the Making of the United States, 1776 to 1815|date=2005-11-03|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/05/11/michaelOren.html| access-date=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the [[Barbary Wars]] that ended the payment of tribute. However, Algiers broke the 1805 peace treaty after only two years, and subsequently refused to implement the 1815 treaty until compelled to do so by Britain in 1816.

In 1815, the sacking of Palma on the island of [[Sardinia]] by a Tunisian squadron, which carried off 158 inhabitants, roused widespread indignation. Britain had by this time banned the slave trade and was seeking to induce other countries to do likewise. This led to complaints from states which were still vulnerable to the corsairs that Britain's enthusiasm for ending the trade in [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] did not extend to stopping the enslavement of Europeans and Americans by the Barbary States.

[[File:Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|U.S. naval officer [[Stephen Decatur]] boarding a Tripolitan gunboat during the [[First Barbary War]], 1804]]
In order to neutralise this objection and further the anti-slavery campaign, in 1816 [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] was sent to secure new concessions from [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Tripoli]], [[Beylik of Tunis|Tunis]], and [[Ottoman Algeria|Algiers]], including a pledge to treat Christian captives in any future conflict as [[prisoners of war]] rather than slaves and the imposition of peace between Algiers and the kingdoms of [[Piedmont-Sardinia|Sardinia]] and [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Sicily]]. On his first visit he negotiated satisfactory treaties and sailed for home. While he was negotiating, a number of Sardinian fishermen who had settled at [[Annaba|Bona]] on the Tunisian coast were brutally treated without his knowledge. As [[Sardinians]] they were technically under British protection and the government sent Exmouth back to secure reparation. On August 17, in combination with a Dutch squadron under Admiral Van de Capellen, he bombarded Algiers.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Both Algiers and Tunis made fresh concessions as a result.

However, securing uniform compliance with a total prohibition of slave-raiding, which was traditionally of central importance to the North African economy, presented difficulties beyond those faced in ending attacks on ships of individual nations, which had left slavers able to continue their accustomed way of life by preying on less well-protected peoples. Algiers subsequently renewed its slave-raiding, though on a smaller scale. Measures to be taken against the city's government were discussed at the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1818. In 1820 another British fleet under Admiral Sir Harry Neal again bombarded Algiers. Corsair activity based in Algiers did not entirely cease until its [[French Algeria#The French conquest of Algeria|conquest by France in 1830]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Barbary Pirates|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the [[Islam]] and the [[colonial era]], slaves became a valuable resource for trading with European, Arab, and Chinese slavers, and the volume of piracy and slave raids increased significantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;junker&quot;/&gt; Numerous native peoples engaged in sea raiding, they include the [[Iranun people|Iranun]] and [[Balanguingui]] slavers of [[Sulu]], the [[Iban people|Iban]] [[headhunting|headhunter]]s of [[Borneo]], the [[Bugis]] sailors of [[South Sulawesi]], and the [[Malay people|Malays]] of western Southeast Asia. Piracy was also practiced by foreign seafarers on a smaller scale, including Chinese, Japanese, and European traders, renegades, and outlaws.&lt;ref name=&quot;turbulent waters&quot;/&gt; The volume of piracy and raids were often dependent on the ebb and flow of trade and [[monsoon]]s, with pirate season (known colloquially as the &quot;Pirate Wind&quot;) starting from August to September.&lt;ref name=&quot;warren2&quot;/&gt;

Slave raids was particularly economically important to the Muslim Sultanates in the [[Sulu Sea]]: the [[Sultanate of Sulu]], the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]], and the [[Confederation of Sultanates in Lanao]] (the modern [[Moro people]]). It is estimated that from 1770 to 1870, around 200,000 to 300,000 people were enslaved by [[Iranun people|Iranun]] and [[Banguingui]] slavers.&lt;ref name=&quot;warren&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;warren2&quot;/&gt; David P.

[[File:Bombardment Balanguingui.jpg|thumb|left|Spanish warships bombarding the [[Moro Pirates]] of the southern Philippines in 1848]]
These slaves were taken from piracy on passing ships as well as coastal raids on settlements as far as the [[Malacca Strait]], [[Java]], the southern coast of [[China]] and the islands beyond the [[Makassar Strait]]. Most of the slaves were [[Tagalogs]], [[Visayans]], and &quot;Malays&quot; (including [[Bugis]], [[Mandarese people|Mandarese]], [[Iban people|Iban]], and [[Makassar people|Makassar]]). There were also occasional European and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] captives who were usually ransomed off through [[Tausug people|Tausug]] intermediaries of the [[Sulu Sultanate]]. Slaves were the primary indicators of wealth and status, and they were the source of labor for the farms, fisheries, and workshops of the sultanates. While personal slaves were rarely sold, they trafficked extensively in slaves purchased from the Iranun and Banguingui [[slave market]]s. By the 1850s, slaves constituted 50% or more of the population of the Sulu archipelago.&lt;ref name=&quot;warren&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James Francis Warren|title =The Sulu Zone, 1768–1898: The Dynamics of External Trade, Slavery, and Ethnicity in the Transformation of a Southeast Asian Maritime State|publisher =NUS Press|year =2007|pages=257–258|isbn =9789971693862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;turbulent waters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;warren2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James Francis Warren|title =Iranun and Balangingi: Globalization, Maritime Raiding and the Birth of Ethnicity|publisher =NUS Press|year =2002|pages=53–56|isbn =9789971692421|url =https://nuspress.nus.edu.sg/products/iranun-and-balangingi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scale was so massive that the word for &quot;pirate&quot; in [[Malay language|Malay]] became ''lanun'', an [[exonym]] of the Iranun people. The economy of the Sulu sultanates was largely run by slaves and the slave trade. Male captives of the Iranun and the Banguingui were treated brutally, even fellow Muslim captives were not spared. They were usually forced to serve as [[galley slave]]s on the ''[[lanong]]'' and ''[[garay (ship)|garay]]'' warships of their captors. Female captives, however, were usually treated better. There were no recorded accounts of rapes, though some were starved for discipline. Within a year of capture, most of the captives of the Iranun and Banguingui would be bartered off in [[Jolo, Sulu|Jolo]] usually for rice, opium, bolts of cloth, iron bars, brassware, and weapons. The buyers were usually Tausug ''[[datu]]'' from the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] who had preferential treatment, but buyers also included European ([[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]]) and Chinese traders as well as [[Visayan peoples|Visayan]] pirates (''renegados'').&lt;ref name=&quot;warren2&quot;/&gt;

[[File:National Museum KL 2008 (54).JPG|thumb|upright|[[British Empire|British]] forces engaging Iranun pirates off [[Sarawak]] in 1843]]
Spanish authorities and native Christian Filipinos responded to the Moro slave raids by building watchtowers and forts across the Philippine archipelago. Many of which are still standing today. Some provincial capitals were also moved further inland. Major command posts were built in [[Manila City|Manila]], [[Cavite City|Cavite]], [[Cebu City|Cebu]], [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]], [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], and [[Iligan City|Iligan]]. Defending ships were also built by local communities, especially in the [[Visayas Islands]], including the construction of war &quot;''barangayanes''&quot; (''[[balangay]]'') that were faster than the Moro raiders and could give chase. As resistance against raiders increased, ''[[Lanong]]'' warships of the Iranun were eventually replaced by the smaller and faster ''[[garay (ship)|garay]]'' warships of the Banguingui in the early 19th century. The Moro raids were eventually subdued by several major naval expeditions by the Spanish and local forces from 1848 to 1891, including retaliatory bombardment and capture of Moro settlements. By this time, the Spanish had also acquired [[steamship|steam gunboat]]s (''vapor''), which could easily overtake and destroy the native Moro warships.&lt;ref name=&quot;warren&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;non&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Domingo M.

===East Asia===
In [[East Asia]] by the ninth century, populations centered mostly around merchant activities in coastal [[Shandong]] and [[Jiangsu]] provinces. Wealthy benefactors, including [[Jang Bogo]] established [[Silla]] Buddhist temples in the region. Jang Bogo had become incensed at the treatment of his fellow countrymen, who in the unstable milieu of late Tang often fell victim to coastal pirates or inland bandits. After returning to Silla around 825, and in possession of a formidable private fleet headquartered at Cheonghae ([[Wando County|Wando]]), Jang Bogo petitioned the Silla king Heungdeok (r. 826–836) to establish a permanent maritime garrison to protect Silla merchant activities in the [[Yellow Sea]]. Heungdeok agreed and in 828 formally established the Cheonghae (淸海, &quot;clear sea&quot;) Garrison(청해진) at what is today Wando island off Korea's South Jeolla province. Heungdeok gave Jang an army of 10,000 men to establish and man the defensive works. The remnants of Cheonghae Garrison can still be seen on Jang islet just off Wando's southern coast. Jang's force, though nominally bequeathed by the Silla king, was effectively under his own control. Jang became arbiter of Yellow Sea commerce and navigation.&lt;ref&gt;Chong Sun Kim, &quot;Slavery in Silla and its Sociological and Economic Implications&quot;, in Andrew C. Nahm, ed. ''Traditional Korea, Theory and Practice'' (Kalamazoo, MI: Center for Korean Studies, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 13th century, Wokou based in Japan made their debut in East Asia, initiating invasions that would persist for 300 years. The wokou raids [[Jiajing wokou raids|peaked in the 1550s]], but by then the wokou were mostly Chinese smugglers who reacted strongly against the [[Ming dynasty]]'s strict prohibition on private sea trade.
[[File:Wokou.jpg|thumb|right|Sixteenth century [[Wokou|Japanese]] pirate raids.]]
During the [[Qing]] period, Chinese pirate fleets grew increasingly large. The effects large-scale piracy had on the Chinese economy were immense. They preyed voraciously on China's junk trade, which flourished in [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] and was a vital artery of Chinese commerce. Pirate fleets exercised [[hegemony]] over villages on the coast, collecting revenue by exacting tribute and running [[extortion]] rackets. In 1802, the menacing [[Zheng Yi (pirate)|Zheng Yi]] inherited the fleet of his cousin, captain Zheng Qi, whose death provided Zheng Yi with considerably more influence in the world of piracy. Zheng Yi and his wife, [[Zheng Yi Sao]] (who would eventually inherit the leadership of his pirate confederacy) then formed a pirate coalition that, by 1804, consisted of over ten thousand men. Their military might alone was sufficient to combat the Qing navy. However, a combination of famine, Qing naval opposition, and internal rifts crippled piracy in China around the 1820s, and it has never again reached the same status.

In the 1840s and 1850s, [[United States Navy]] and Royal Navy forces campaigned together against Chinese pirates. Major battles were fought such as those at [[Battle of Ty-ho Bay|Ty-ho Bay]] and the [[Battle of Tonkin River|Tonkin River]] though pirate [[junk (ship)|junks]] continued operating off China for years more. However, some British and American individual citizens also volunteered to serve with Chinese pirates to fight against European forces. The British offered rewards for the capture of westerners serving with Chinese pirates. During the [[Second Opium War]] and the [[Taiping Rebellion]], piratical junks were again destroyed in large numbers by British naval forces but ultimately it wasn't until the 1860s and 1870s that fleets of pirate junks ceased to exist.

==== Piracy in the Ming dynasty ====
Pirates in the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] era tended to come from populations on the geographic periphery of the state.&lt;ref&gt;MacKay, Joseph. “Pirate Nations: Maritime Pirates as Escape Societies in Late Imperial China.” ''Social Science History'' ''37'', no. 4 (2013): 551–73. {{doi|10.1017/S0145553200011962}}. p. 554&lt;/ref&gt;  They were recruited largely from the lower classes of society, including poor fishermen, and many were fleeing from obligatory labor on state-building projects organized by the dynasty.  These lower-class men, and sometimes women, may have fled taxation or conscription by the state in the search of better opportunities and wealth, and willingly joined local pirate bands.&lt;ref&gt;MacKay. 2013. p. 553&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacKay. 2013. p. 555&lt;/ref&gt;  These local, lower class individuals seem to have felt unrepresented, and traded the small amount of security afforded them from their allegiance to the state for the promise of a relatively improved existence engaging in smuggling or other illegal trade.

Originally, pirates in the coastal areas near Fujian and Zhejiang may have been Japanese, suggested by the Ming government referring to them as “''[[wokou]]'' (倭寇),” but it is probable that piracy was a multi-ethnic profession by the 16th century, although coastal brigands continued to be referred to as ''wokou'' in many government documents.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Roland L.  “Pirates in Gowns and Caps: Gentry Law-Breaking in the Mid-Ming.” ''Ming Studies Volume 1980'', Issue #1.  Pages 30–37 p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Most pirates were probably [[Han Chinese]], but Japanese and even Europeans engaged in pirate activities in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, David M. &quot;Banditry and the Subversion of State Authority in China: The Capital Region During the Middle Ming Period (1450–1525).&quot; ''Journal of Social History'' 33, no. 3 (2000): 527–563. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed February 20, 2019). p. 547&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Illegal trade and authority ====
Pirates engaged in a number of different schemes to make a living.  Smuggling and illegal trade overseas were major sources of revenue for pirate bands, both large and small.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higgins. 1980. p. 31&quot;&gt;Higgins. 1980. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Ming government mostly outlawed private trade overseas, at least until the overseas silver trade contributed to a lifting of the ban, pirates basically could almost by default control the market for any number of foreign goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higgins. 1980. p. 31&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Glahn, Richard. ''The Economic History of China: From Antiquity to the Nineteenth Century''. Cambridge, United Kingdom. {{ISBN|9781107030565}}. [[OCLC]] 919452147. p.307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Von Glahn. 2016. p. 308&quot;&gt;Von Glahn. 2016. p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;  The geography of the coastline made chasing pirates quite difficult for the authorities, and private overseas trade began to transform coastal societies by the 15th century, as nearly all aspects of the local society benefitted from or associated with illegal trade.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins. 1980. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to trade for silver eventually led to open conflict between the Ming and illegal smugglers and pirates.  This conflict, along with local merchants in southern China, helped persuade the Ming court to end the [[haijin]] ban on private international trade in 1567.&lt;ref name=&quot;Von Glahn. 2016. p. 308&quot;/&gt;

Pirates also projected local political authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;MacKay. 2013. p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;  Larger pirate bands could act as local governing bodies for coastal communities, collecting taxes and engaging in “protection” schemes.  In addition to illegal goods, pirates ostensibly offered security to communities on land in exchange for a tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;MacKay. 2013. p. 557&lt;/ref&gt;  These bands also wrote and codified laws that redistributed wealth, punished crimes, and provided protection for the taxed community.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;  These laws were strictly followed by the pirates, as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;MacKay. 2013. p. 567&lt;/ref&gt;  The political structures tended to look similar to the Ming structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

==== Hierarchy and structure ====
Pirates did not tend to stay pirates permanently.  It seems to have been relatively easy both to join and leave a pirate band, and these raiding groups were more interested in maintaining a willing force.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;MacKay. 2013. pp. 564, 568&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of these pirate groups did not tend to stay longer than a few months or years at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

There appears to have been a hierarchy in most pirate organizations.  Pirate leaders could become very wealthy and powerful, especially when working with the Chinese dynasty, and, consequently, so could those who served under them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;  These pirate groups were organized similarly to other “escape societies” throughout history, and maintained a redistributive system to reward looting; the pirates directly responsible for looting or pillaging got their cut first, and the rest was allocated to the rest of the pirate community.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;  There seems to be evidence that there was an egalitarian aspect to these communities, with capability to do the job being rewarded explicitly.  The pirates themselves had some special privileges under the law when they interacted with communities on land, mostly in the form of extra allotments of redistributed wealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

==== Clientele ====
Pirates, of course, had to sell their loot.  They had trading relationships with land communities and foreign traders in the southeastern regions of China. [[Zhu Wan]], who held the office of Grand Coordinator for Coastal Defense, documented that pirates in the region to which he had been sent had the support of the local elite gentry class.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins. 1980. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  These “pirates in gowns and caps” directly or indirectly sponsored pirate activity and certainly directly benefitted from the illegal private trade in the region.  When Zhu Wan or other officials from the capital attempted to eliminate the pirate problem, these local elites fought back, having Zhu Wan demoted and eventually even sent back to Beijing to possibly be executed.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins. 1980. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  The gentry who benefitted from illegal maritime trade were too powerful and influential, and they were clearly very invested in the smuggling activities of the pirate community.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson. 2000. p. 547&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their relationship with the local elite class on the coast, pirates also had complicated and often friendly relationships and partnerships with the dynasty itself, as well as with international traders.&lt;ref&gt;MacKay. 2013. pp. 552, 557&lt;/ref&gt;  When pirate groups recognized the authority of the dynasty, they would often be allowed to operate freely and even profit from the relationship.  There were also opportunities for these pirates to ally themselves with colonial projects from Europe or other overseas powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKay. 2013. p. 559&quot;&gt;MacKay. 2013. p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the dynasty and foreign colonial projects would employ pirates as mercenaries to establish dominance in the coastal region.&lt;ref&gt;MacKay. 2013. p. 551&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of how difficult it was for established state powers to control these regions, pirates seem to have had a lot of freedom to choose their allies and their preferred markets.&lt;ref&gt;Szonyi, Michael. ''The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China''. Princeton. {{ISBN|9781400888887}}. [[OCLC]] 1007291604. pp. 101, 102&lt;/ref&gt;  Included in this list of possible allies, sea marauders and pirates even found opportunities to bribe military officials as they engaged in illegal trade.&lt;ref&gt;Szonyi. 2017. pp. 101, 102&lt;/ref&gt;  They seem to have been incentivized mostly by money and loot, and so could afford to play the field with regards to their political or military allies.

Because pirate organizations could be so powerful locally, the Ming government made concerted efforts to weaken them.  The presence of colonial projects complicated this, however, as pirates could ally themselves with other maritime powers or local elites to stay in business.  The Chinese government was clearly aware of the power of some of these pirate groups, as some documents even refer to them as “sea rebels,” a reference to the political nature of pirates.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKay. 2013. p. 559&quot;/&gt;  Pirates like [[Zheng Zhilong]] and [[Koxinga|Zheng Chenggong]] accrued tremendous local power, eventually even being hired as naval commanders by the Chinese dynasties and foreign maritime powers.&lt;ref&gt;MacKay. 2013. pp. 559, 561&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Asia===
Pirates who accepted the Royal Pardon from the [[Chola Dynasty|Chola Empire]] would get to serve in the [[Chola Navy]] as &quot;Kallarani&quot;. They would be used as coast guards, or sent on recon missions to deal with Arab piracy in the [[Arabian Sea]]. Their function is similar to the 18th century [[privateers]], used by the Royal Navy.

Starting in the 14th century, the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (Southern Peninsular region of India) was divided into two entities: on the one side stood the Muslim [[Bahmani Sultanate]] and on the other stood the Hindu kings rallied around the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. Continuous wars demanded frequent resupplies of fresh horses, which were imported through sea routes from Persia and Africa. This trade was subjected to frequent raids by thriving bands of pirates based in the coastal cities of Western India. One of such was [[Timoji]], who operated off [[Anjadip Island]] both as a privateer (by seizing horse traders, that he rendered to the [[raja]] of [[Honavar]]) and as a pirate who attacked the Kerala merchant fleets that traded pepper with [[Gujarat]].

During the 16th and 17th centuries, there was frequent European piracy against [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Indian merchants, especially those en route to Mecca for [[Hajj]]. The situation came to a head when the Portuguese attacked and captured the vessel ''Rahimi'' which belonged to [[Mariam Zamani]] the Mughal queen, which led to the Mughal seizure of the Portuguese town Daman.&lt;ref&gt;Findly, Elison B (April – June 1988). &quot;The Capture of Maryam-uz-Zamani's Ship: Mughal Women and European Traders,&quot; ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', 108 (2): 227–238.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, the famous [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] privateer [[Kanhoji Angre]] ruled the seas between Mumbai and Goa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_world_history/v012/12.2risso.html|title=Cross-Cultural Perceptions of Piracy: Maritime Violence in the Western Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf Region during a Long Eighteenth Century}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marathas attacked British shipping and insisted that [[British East India Company|East India Company]] ships pay taxes if sailing through their waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/exhibitions/soldiersSeahawks/page2.shtml|title=Soldiers, Seahawks and Smugglers|access-date=July 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906064531/http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/exhibitions/soldiersSeahawks/page2.shtml|archive-date=September 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian Gulf===
{{Main|Piracy in the Persian Gulf}}
The southern coast of the [[Persian Gulf]] was known to the British from the late 18th century as the ''[[Pirate Coast]], ''where control of the seaways of the Persian Gulf was asserted by the Qawasim ([[Al-Qasimi|Al Qasimi]]) and other local maritime powers. Memories of the privations carried out on the coast by Portuguese raiders under Albuquerque were long and local powers antipathetic as a consequence to Christian powers asserting dominance of their coastal waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last = Heard-Bey|first = Frauke|publisher = Longman|year = 1996|isbn = 0582277280|location = UK|pages = 282–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early British expeditions to protect the Imperial [[Trade route|Indian Ocean trade]] from competitors, principally the Al Qasimi from [[Ras Al Khaimah]] and [[Bandar Lengeh|Lingeh]], led to campaigns against those headquarters and other harbours along the coast in [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1809|1809]] and then, after a relapse in raiding, again in [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1819|1819]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197306/from.pirate.coast.to.trucial.htm|title=From Pirate Coast To Trucial|access-date=July 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829143613/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197306/from.pirate.coast.to.trucial.htm|archive-date=August 29, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the signing of the first formal treaty of [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|maritime peace]] between the British and the rulers of several coastal sheikhdoms in 1820. This was cemented by the Treaty of Maritime Peace in Perpetuity in 1853, resulting in the British label for the area, 'Pirate Coast' being softened to the 'Trucial Coast', with several emirates being recognised by the British as [[Trucial States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Madagascar===
[[File:Pirates Cemetery Ile Ste Marie Madagascar.jpg|thumb|The cemetery of past pirates at Île Ste-Marie (St. Mary's Island)]]

The most famous [[pirate utopia]] is that of the probably fictional Captain Misson and his pirate crew, who allegedly founded the free colony of [[Libertatia]] in northern Madagascar in the late 17th century, until it was destroyed in a surprise attack by the island natives in 1694.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=869187%7ctitle=Libertatia|title=Libertatia|work=everything2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic era of piracy in the [[Caribbean]] lasted from circa 1650 until the mid-1720s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucie-Smith|first=Edward|title=Outcasts of the Sea: Pirates and Piracy|publisher=Paddington Press|year=1978|isbn=9780448226170|url=https://archive.org/details/outcastsofseapir0000luci}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1650, [[France]], [[England]] and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] began to develop their colonial empires.  This involved considerable seaborne trade, and a general economic improvement: there was money to be made—or stolen—and much of it traveled by ship.

French buccaneers were established on northern [[Hispaniola]] as early as 1625,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewayofthepirates.com/history-of-piracy/tortuga.php|title=Tortuga – Pirate History – The Way Of The Pirates|access-date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lived at first mostly as hunters rather than robbers; their transition to full-time piracy was gradual and motivated in part by Spanish efforts to wipe out both the buccaneers and the prey animals on which they depended.  The buccaneers' migration from Hispaniola's mainland to the more defensible offshore island of [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] limited their resources and accelerated their piratical raids. According to [[Alexandre Exquemelin]], a buccaneer and historian who remains a major source on this period, the Tortuga buccaneer [[Pierre le Grand (pirate)|Pierre Le Grand]] pioneered the settlers' attacks on galleons making the return voyage to Spain.

The growth of buccaneering on Tortuga was augmented by the English capture of Jamaica from Spain in 1655.  The early English governors of Jamaica freely granted letters of marque to Tortuga buccaneers and to their own countrymen, while the growth of [[Port Royal]] provided these raiders with a far more profitable and enjoyable place to sell their booty.  In the 1660s, the new French governor of Tortuga, Bertrand d'Ogeron, similarly provided privateering commissions both to his own colonists and to English cutthroats from Port Royal.  These conditions brought Caribbean buccaneering to its zenith.

[[File:Pg 003 - Engraving (bw).jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Every]] is shown selling his loot in this engraving by Howard Pyle. Every's capture of the Grand Mughal ship ''[[Ganj-i-Sawai]]'' in 1695 stands as one of the most profitable pirate raids ever perpetrated.]]
A new phase of piracy began in the 1690s as English pirates began to look beyond the Caribbean for treasure. The fall of Britain's Stuart kings had restored the traditional enmity between Britain and France, thus ending the profitable collaboration between English Jamaica and French Tortuga.  The devastation of Port Royal by an [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|earthquake in 1692]] further reduced the Caribbean's attractions by destroying the pirates' chief market for fenced plunder.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Cawthorne (2005), ''Pirates: An Illustrated History,'' Arturus Publishing Ltd., 2005, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  Caribbean colonial governors began to discard the traditional policy of &quot;no peace beyond the Line,&quot; under which it was understood that war would continue (and thus letters of marque would be granted) in the Caribbean regardless of peace treaties signed in Europe; henceforth, commissions would be granted only in wartime, and their limitations would be strictly enforced.  Furthermore, much of the Spanish Main had simply been exhausted; [[Maracaibo]] alone had been sacked three times between 1667 and 1678,&lt;ref&gt;Cawthorne, p. 34, 36, 58&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Rio de la Hacha|Río de la Hacha]] had been raided five times and [[Tolú]] eight.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Earle (2003), ''The Pirate Wars'', {{ISBN|0-312-33579-2}}, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bartholomew Roberts.jpg|thumb|Bartholomew Roberts was the pirate with most captures during the Golden Age of Piracy. He is now known for hanging the governor of [[Martinique]] from the yardarm of his ship.]]
At the same time, England's less favored colonies, including [[Bermuda]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Rhode Island]], had become cash-starved by the [[Navigation Acts]], which restricted trade with foreign ships.  Merchants and governors eager for coin were willing to overlook and even underwrite pirate voyages; one colonial official defended a pirate because he thought it &quot;very harsh to hang people that brings in gold to these provinces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Earle, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some of these pirates operating out of New England and the Middle Colonies targeted Spain's remoter Pacific coast colonies well into the 1690s and beyond, the Indian Ocean was a richer and more tempting target.  India's economic output was large during this time, especially in high-value luxury goods like silk and calico which made ideal pirate booty;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, ed. (1986), ''The World: An Illustrated History'', Times Books Ltd., p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time, no powerful navies plied the Indian Ocean, leaving both local shipping and the various East India companies' vessels vulnerable to attack.  This set the stage for the famous pirates, [[Thomas Tew]], Henry Every, [[Robert Culliford]] and (although his guilt remains controversial) [[William Kidd]].

Between 1713 and 1714, a succession of peace [[treaties]] was signed which ended the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. With the end of this conflict, thousands of seamen, including Britain's [[paramilitary]] privateers, were relieved of military duty. The result was a large number of trained, idle sailors at a time when the cross-Atlantic colonial shipping trade was beginning to boom. In addition, Europeans who had been pushed by unemployment to become sailors and soldiers involved in slaving were often enthusiastic to abandon that profession and turn to pirating, giving pirate captains for many years a constant pool of trained European recruits to be found in west African waters and coasts.

In 1715, pirates launched a major raid on Spanish divers trying to recover gold from a sunken treasure galleon near Florida.  The nucleus of the pirate force was a group of English ex-privateers, all of whom would soon be enshrined in infamy: [[Henry Jennings]], [[Charles Vane]], [[Samuel Bellamy]], and [[Edward England]]. The attack was successful, but contrary to their expectations, the governor of Jamaica refused to allow Jennings and their cohorts to spend their loot on his island. With Kingston and the declining Port Royal closed to them, Jennings and his comrades founded a new pirate base at [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], on the island of [[New Providence]] in the Bahamas, which had been abandoned during the war. Until the arrival of governor [[Woodes Rogers]] three years later, Nassau would be home for these pirates and their many recruits.

Shipping traffic between Africa, the Caribbean, and Europe began to soar in the 18th century, a model that was known as [[triangular trade]], and was a rich target for piracy. Trade ships sailed from Europe to the African coast, trading manufactured goods and weapons in exchange for slaves. The traders would then sail to the Caribbean to sell the slaves, and return to Europe with goods such as sugar, tobacco and cocoa. Another triangular trade saw ships carry raw materials, preserved cod, and rum to Europe, where a portion of the cargo would be sold for manufactured goods, which (along with the remainder of the original load) were transported to the Caribbean, where they were exchanged for sugar and molasses, which (with some manufactured articles) were borne to New England. Ships in the triangular trade made money at each stop.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kurlansky, ''Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World.'' Penguin, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pirata Cofresi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Born to a noble family in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Roberto Cofresí]] was the last notably successful pirate in the Caribbean.]]
As part of the peace settlement of the [[War of the Spanish succession]], Britain obtained the ''[[asiento]]'', a Spanish government contract, to [[slave trade|supply slaves]] to Spain's new world colonies, providing British traders and smugglers more access to the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America. This arrangement also contributed heavily to the spread of piracy across the western Atlantic at this time. Shipping to the colonies boomed simultaneously with the flood of skilled mariners after the war. Merchant shippers used the surplus of sailors' labor to drive wages down, cutting corners to maximize their profits, and creating unsavory conditions aboard their vessels. Merchant sailors suffered from mortality rates as high or higher than the slaves being transported (Rediker, 2004). Living conditions were so poor that many sailors began to prefer a freer existence as a [[pirate]]. The increased volume of shipping traffic also could sustain a large body of brigands preying upon it. Among the most infamous Caribbean pirates of the time were [[Edward Teach]] or ''Blackbeard'', [[Calico Jack|Calico Jack Rackham]], and [[Bartholomew Roberts]].

[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] knowledge of the fabulous beast stemmed from [[Re'em|biblical]] and ancient sources, and the creature was variously represented as a kind of [[Onager|wild ass]], [[goat]], or [[horse]].

The predecessor of the medieval [[bestiary]], compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] and known as ''[[Physiologus]]'' (''Φυσιολόγος''), popularized an elaborate [[allegory]] in which a unicorn, trapped by a maiden (representing the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]]), stood for the [[Incarnation]]. As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head on her lap and falls asleep. This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in every form of [[Sacred art|religious art.]] Interpretations of the unicorn myth focus on the medieval lore of beguiled lovers,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} whereas some religious writers interpret the unicorn and its death as the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]]. The myths refer to a beast with one horn that can only be tamed by a [[Virginity|virgin]]; subsequently, some writers translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary.

The unicorn also figured in [[courtly love|courtly terms]]: for some 13th-century [[France|French]] authors such as [[Theobald I of Navarre|Thibaut of Champagne]] and [[Richard de Fournival]], the lover is attracted to his lady as the unicorn is to the virgin. With the rise of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]], the unicorn also acquired more orthodox secular meanings, emblematic of chaste love and faithful marriage. It plays this role in [[Petrarch]]'s ''Triumph of Chastity'', and on the reverse of [[Piero della Francesca]]'s portrait of Battista Strozzi, paired with that of her husband [[Federico da Montefeltro]] (painted {{circa}} 1472–74), Bianca's [[triumphal car]] is drawn by a pair of unicorns.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Aronberg Lavin, 2002. ''Piero della Francesca'', pp. 260-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frederik vi in coronationrobes1830.jpg|thumb|The [[Throne Chair of Denmark|unicorn throne]] in [[Denmark]]]]
The [[Throne Chair of Denmark]] is made of &quot;unicorn horns&quot; – almost certainly [[narwhal]] tusks. The same material was used for ceremonial cups because the unicorn's horn continued to be believed to neutralize poison, following classical authors.

The unicorn, tamable only by a virgin woman, was well established in medieval lore by the time [[Marco Polo]] described them as &quot;scarcely smaller than elephants. They have the hair of a buffalo and feet like an elephant's. They have a single large black horn in the middle of the forehead... They have a head like a wild boar's… They spend their time by preference wallowing in [[mud]] and slime. They are very ugly brutes to look at. They are not at all such as we describe them when we relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary to our notions.&quot; It is clear that Marco Polo was describing a rhinoceros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Noah |title=The Story of Marco Polo |url=https://archive.org/details/storyofmarcopolo00broouoft |date=1898 |publisher=Palala Press (originally The Century Co.) |isbn=978-1341338465 |page=[https://archive.org/details/storyofmarcopolo00broouoft/page/221 221] |edition=2015 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alicorn ====
{{Main article|Unicorn horn}}

The horn itself and the substance it was made of was called '''alicorn''', and it was believed that the horn holds magical and medicinal properties. The [[Danish people|Danish]] physician [[Ole Worm]] determined in 1638 that the alleged alicorns were the tusks of narwhals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mythical creatures|author=Linda S Godfrey|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=2009|page=28|isbn=978-0-7910-9394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beliefs were examined wittily and at length in 1646 by Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

False alicorn powder, made from the tusks of [[narwhal]]s or horns of various animals, has been sold in Europe for medicinal purposes as late as 1741.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exotic Zoology|url=https://archive.org/details/exoticzoologyill0000leyw|url-access=registration|author=Willy Ley|year=1962|publisher=Viking Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/exoticzoologyill0000leyw/page/20 20–22]|oclc=4049353}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alicorn was thought to cure many diseases and have the ability to detect poisons, and many physicians would make &quot;cures&quot; and sell them. Cups were made from alicorn for kings and given as a gift; these were usually made of [[ivory]] or [[walrus]] ivory. Entire horns were very precious in the Middle Ages and were often really the tusks of narwhals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shepard, Odell|title=The Lore of the Unicorn|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/etc/lou/index.htm|publisher=London, Unwin and Allen|year=1930|isbn=978-1-4375-0853-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entrapment ===
[[File:The Hunt of the Unicorn Tapestry 7.jpg|thumb|''The Unicorn Is Penned,'' Unicorn Tapestries, c. 1495–1505 ([[The Cloisters]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]])]]
[[File:Französischer Tapisseur (15. Jahrhundert) 001.jpg|thumb|''Maiden with Unicorn'', tapestry, 15th century ([[Musée de Cluny]], [[Paris]])]]
One traditional method of hunting unicorns involved entrapment by a virgin.

In one of his notebooks [[Leonardo da Vinci]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The unicorn, through its intemperance and not knowing how to control itself, for the love it bears to fair maidens forgets its ferocity and wildness; and laying aside all fear it will go up to a seated damsel and go to sleep in her lap, and thus the hunters take it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalleonardo.org/work.php?id=438|title=Universal Leonardo: Leonardo da Vinci online › Young woman seated in a landscape with a unicorn|website=www.universalleonardo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The famous late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] series of seven [[tapestry]] hangings ''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'' are a high point in [[Europe]]an tapestry manufacture, combining both secular and religious themes. The tapestries now hang in [[the Cloisters]] division of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]. In the series, richly dressed [[Nobility|noblemen]], accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against ''[[mille-fleur]]'' backgrounds or settings of buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay with the help of a maiden who traps it with her charms, appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle; in the last and most famous panel, &quot;The Unicorn in Captivity&quot;, the unicorn is shown alive again and happy, chained to a [[pomegranate]] tree surrounded by a fence, in a field of flowers. Scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood but rather the juice from pomegranates, which were a symbol of fertility. However, the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected unicorn in the last panel is unclear. The series was woven about 1500 in the [[Low Countries]], probably [[Brussels]] or [[Liège (city)|Liège]], for an unknown patron. A set of six [[engraving]]s on the same theme, treated rather differently, were engraved by the French artist [[Jean Duvet]] in the 1540s.

Another famous set of six tapestries of ''[[The Lady and the Unicorn|Dame à la licorne]]'' (&quot;Lady with the unicorn&quot;) in the [[Musée de Cluny]], [[Paris]], were also woven in the [[Southern Netherlands]] before 1500, and show the five senses (the gateways to temptation) and finally Love (&quot;A mon seul desir&quot; the legend reads), with unicorns featured in each piece. Facsimiles of these unicorn tapestries were woven for permanent display in [[Stirling Castle]], [[Scotland]], to take the place of a set recorded in the castle in a [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|16th-century inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient unicorn tapestries recreated at Stirling Castle|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-33237947|website=BBC News|accessdate=11 June 2017|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rather rare, late-15th-century, variant depiction of the ''[[hortus conclusus]]'' in religious art combined the [[Annunciation to Mary]] with the themes of the ''Hunt of the Unicorn'' and ''Virgin and Unicorn'', so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the [[Incarnation of Christ|Incarnation]] and whether this meaning is intended in many ''prima facie'' secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel [[Gabriel]] is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The [[Council of Trent]] finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction,&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'',1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, pp. 52-4 &amp; figs 126-9, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}, [http://www.sagen.at/fotos/data/603/medium/Maria_Gail_HortusConclusus_Detail.jpg another image]&lt;/ref&gt; partly on the grounds of realism, as no one now believed the unicorn to be a real animal.

[[Shakespeare]] scholars describe unicorns being captured by a hunter standing in front of a tree, the unicorn goaded into charging; the hunter would step aside the last moment and the unicorn would embed its horn deeply into the tree (See annotations&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Shakespeare'', Fourth Edition, [[David Bevington]], pg. 1281;''The Norton Shakespeare'', Second Edition, pg 2310, footnote 9; ''[[The Riverside Shakespeare]]'', Second Edition, page 1515&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Timon of Athens]], Act 4, scene 3, c. line 341: &quot;wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury&quot;.)

=== Heraldry ===
In [[heraldry]], a unicorn is often depicted as a horse with a goat's cloven hooves and beard, a lion's tail, and a slender, spiral horn on its forehead&lt;ref name=&quot;friar&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-906670-44-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (non-equine attributes may be replaced with equine ones, as can be seen from the following gallery). Whether because it was an emblem of the Incarnation or of the fearsome animal passions of raw nature, the unicorn was not widely used in early heraldry, but became popular from the 15th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;friar&quot; /&gt; Though sometimes shown collared and chained, which may be taken as an indication that it has been tamed or tempered, it is more usually shown collared with a broken chain attached, showing that it has broken free from its bondage.

==== Scotland ====
{{See also|The Lion and the Unicorn}}
In heraldry the unicorn is best known as a symbol of [[Scotland]]: the unicorn was believed to be the natural enemy of the lion – a symbol that the English royals had adopted around a hundred years before&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/why-is-the-unicorn-scotland-s-national-animal-1-3953188 |title=Why is the Unicorn Scotland’s national animal? |newspaper=The Scotsman | date=19 November 2015 |accessdate=14 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and was also chosen because it was seen as a proud and haughty beast which would rather die than be captured, just as Scots would fight to remain sovereign and unconquered.&lt;ref name=Nisbet&gt;{{cite book|last=Nisbet|first=Alexander|title=A System of Heraldry|publisher=William Blackwood|location=Edinburgh|date=1816|url=https://archive.org/stream/systemofheraldry01nisbuoft#page/304/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two unicorns supported the [[royal arms of Scotland|royal arms]] of the King of Scots, and since the [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 union]] of England and Scotland, the [[royal arms of the United Kingdom]] have been supported by a unicorn along with an English lion. Two versions of the royal arms exist: that used in Scotland gives more emphasis to the Scottish elements, placing the unicorn on the left and giving it a crown, whereas the version used in England and elsewhere gives the English elements more prominence.

Golden coins known as the [[unicorn (coin)|unicorn]] and half-unicorn, both with a unicorn on the [[obverse]], were used in Scotland in the 15th and 16th century. In the same realm, carved unicorns were often used as finials on the pillars of [[Mercat cross]]es, and denoted that the settlement was a [[royal burgh]]. Certain noblemen such as the [[Earl of Kinnoull]] were given special permission to use the unicorn in their arms, as an [[augmentation of honour]].&lt;ref name=Nisbet/&gt;   The crest for [[Clan Cunningham]] bears a unicorn head.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U5pkxvtxyr8C&amp;q=clan+cunningham+unicorn&amp;dq=clan+cunningham+unicorn&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4vZullfDMAhVJU1IKHdcCADwQ6AEIIDABClans &amp; tartans] George Way, Romilly Squire; HarperCollins, 1995; page 84 &quot;Cunningham CREST A unicorn's head couped Argent armed Or MOTTO 'Over fork over'&lt;/ref&gt;

An animal called the ''[[re'em]]'' ({{lang-he|רְאֵם}}) is mentioned in several places in the [[Hebrew Bible]], often as a metaphor representing strength. The allusions to the ''re'em'' as a wild, untamable animal of great strength and agility, with mighty horn or horns&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Job|Job]] 39:9–12; [[Psalms]] 22:21, 29:6; [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 23:22, 24:8; [[Deuteronomy]] 33:17; compare Psalms 112:11&lt;/ref&gt; best fit the [[aurochs]] (''Bos primigenius''); this view is further supported by the Assyrian cognate word ''rimu,'' which is often used as a metaphor of strength, and is depicted as a powerful, fierce, wild mountain bull with large horns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14584-unicorn|title=UNICORN - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This animal was often depicted in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n art in profile, with only one horn visible.{{cn|date=March 2020}}

The translators of the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the [[Bible]] (1611) followed the Greek [[Septuagint]] (''monokeros'') and the Latin [[Vulgate]] (''unicornis'')&lt;ref&gt;Psalms 21:22, 28:6, 77:69, 91:11; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 34:7. The Latin ''rhinoceros'' is employed in Numbers 23:22, 24:8; Deuteronomy 33:17, Job 39:9–10&lt;/ref&gt; and employed ''unicorn'' to translate ''re'em'', providing a recognizable animal that was proverbial for its untamable nature. The [[American Standard Version]] translates this term &quot;wild ox&quot; in each case.

* &quot;God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an '''unicorn'''.&quot;—{{bibleverse||Numbers|23:22}}
* &quot;God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an '''unicorn'''.&quot;—{{bibleverse||Numbers|24:8}}

Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?&quot;—{{bibleverse||Job|39:9–12}}
* &quot;Save me from the lion's mouth; for thou hast heard me from the horns of '''unicorns'''.&quot;—{{bibleverse||Psalms|22:21}}

* &quot;And the '''unicorns''' shall come down with them, and the bullocks with their bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.&quot;—{{bibleverse||Isaiah|34:7}}

The classical Jewish understanding of the Bible did not identify the ''Re'em'' animal as the unicorn. However, some rabbis in the [[Talmud]] debate the proposition that the ''[[Tahash]]'' animal (Exodus 25, 26, 35, 36 and 39; Numbers 4; and Ezekiel 16:10) was a domestic, single-horned [[kosher]] creature that existed in Moses' time, or that it was similar to the ''keresh'' animal described in [[Morris Jastrow]]'s Talmudic dictionary as &quot;a kind of antelope, unicorn&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_28.html|title=Babylonian Talmud: Shabbath 28|website=halakhah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese mythology===
[[File:Pottery unicorn. Northern Wei (386-534 CE).jpg|thumb|Pottery Unicorn. Northern Wei. Shaanxi History Museum]]
The ''[[qilin]]'' ({{zh|c=麒麟}}), a creature in [[Chinese mythology]], is sometimes called &quot;the Chinese unicorn&quot;, and some ancient accounts describe a single horn as its defining feature. However, it is more accurately described as a [[:Category:Mythological hybrids|hybrid animal]] that looks less unicorn than [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], with the body of a deer, the head of a lion, green [[Scale (zoology)|scales]] and a long forwardly-curved horn. The [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] version (''kirin'') more closely resembles the Western unicorn, even though it is based on the Chinese ''qilin''. The Quẻ Ly of [[Vietnam]]ese myth, similarly sometimes mistranslated &quot;unicorn&quot; is a symbol of wealth and prosperity that made its first appearance during the Duong Dynasty, about 600 CE, to Emperor Duong Cao To, after a military victory which resulted in his conquest of [[Tây Nguyên]]. In November 2012 the History Institute of the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences, as well as the [[Korean Central News Agency|Korea News Service]], reported that the [[Kiringul]] had been found, which is associated with a kirin ridden by [[King Dongmyeong of Goguryeo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lair of King Tongmyong's Unicorn Reconfirmed in DPRK|date=November 29, 2012|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2012/201211/news29/20121129-20ee.html|publisher=[[Korean Central News Agency]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203012958/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2012/201211/news29/20121129-20ee.html|archivedate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Quinn|first=Ben|title=Unicorn lair 'discovered' in North Korea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/30/unicorn-lair-discovered-north-korea|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the [[Ming Dynasty]], the ''qilin'' became associated with [[giraffe]]s, after [[Zheng He]]'s [[Treasure voyages|voyage]] to [[East Africa]] brought a pair of the long-necked animals and introduced them at court in [[Nanjing]] as ''qilin''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Samuel M. &quot;The Emperor's Giraffe&quot;, ''Natural History'' Vol. 101, No. 12, December 1992 {{cite web |url=http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/WILSON09.ART |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202235051/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/WILSON09.ART |archivedate=2008-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resemblance to the ''qilin'' was noted in the giraffe's [[ossicones]] (bony protrusions from the skull resembling horns), graceful movements, and peaceful demeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/news/2004year/2004-05-31/26/442822.shtml|title=此“麟”非彼“麟”专家称萨摩麟并非传说中麒麟|website=www.chinanews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shanhaijing]] (117) also mentioned ''Bo''-horse ({{zh|c=駮馬|p=bómǎ}}), a chimera horse with ox tail, single horn, white body, and its sound like person calling. The creature is lived at Honest-head Mountain. [[Guo Pu]] in his ''jiangfu'' said that ''Bo''-horse able to walk on water.

'''Thomas Telford''' [[Royal Society of London|FRS]], [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (9 August 1757 – 2 September 1834) was a Scottish [[civil engineer]], architect and [[stonemason]], and road, bridge and [[canal]] builder. After establishing himself as an engineer of road and canal projects in [[Shropshire]], he designed numerous infrastructure projects in his native Scotland, as well as harbours and tunnels. Such was his reputation as a prolific designer of highways and related bridges, he was dubbed ''The Colossus of Roads'' (a pun on the [[Colossus of Rhodes]]), and, reflecting his command of all types of civil engineering in the early 19th century, he was elected as the first President of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]], a post he held for 14 years until his death.

==Early career==
Telford was born on 9 August 1757, at Glendinning, a [[hill farm]] 3 miles east of [[Eskdalemuir Kirk]], in the rural [[List of Church of Scotland parishes|parish]] of Westerkirk, in [[Eskdale, Dumfries and Galloway|Eskdale, Dumfriesshire]]. His father John Telford, a shepherd, died soon after Thomas was born. Thomas was raised in poverty by his mother Janet Jackson (died 1794).&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterston&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Portrait of Thos. Telford (4672707).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait and signature of Thomas Telford]]
At the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a stonemason, and some of his earliest work can still be seen on the bridge across the [[River Esk, Dumfriesshire|River Esk]] in [[Langholm]] in the Scottish borders. He worked for a time in [[Edinburgh]] and in 1782 he moved to London where, after meeting architects [[Robert Adam]] and Sir [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]], he was involved in building additions to [[Somerset House]] there. Two years later he found work at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth dockyard]] and — although still largely self-taught — was extending his talents to the specification, design and management of building projects.

In 1787, through his wealthy patron [[Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet|William Pulteney]], he became Surveyor of Public Works in Shropshire. Civil engineering was a discipline still in its infancy, so Telford was set on establishing himself as an architect. His projects included renovation of [[Shrewsbury Castle]], the town's [[prison]] (during the planning of which he met leading prison reformer [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]]), the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Bridgnorth]] and another church, St Michael, in [[Madeley (Shropshire)|Madeley]]. Called in to advise on a leaking roof at St Chad's Church Shrewsbury in 1788, he warned the church was in imminent danger of collapse; his reputation was made locally when it collapsed 3 days later, but he was not the architect for its replacement.

As the Shropshire county surveyor, Telford was also responsible for bridges. In 1790 he designed a bridge carrying the London–[[Holyhead]] road over the [[River Severn]] at [[Montford, Shropshire|Montford]], the first of some 40 bridges he built in Shropshire, including major crossings of the Severn at [[Buildwas]], and [[Bridgnorth]]. The bridge at Buildwas was Telford's first iron bridge. He was influenced by [[Abraham Darby III|Abraham Darby's]] [[The Iron Bridge|bridge]] at [[Ironbridge]], and observed that it was grossly over-designed for its function, and many of the component parts were poorly cast. By contrast, his bridge was 30&amp;nbsp;ft (10&amp;nbsp;m) wider in span and half the weight, although it now no longer exists. He was one of the first engineers to test his materials thoroughly before construction. As his engineering prowess grew, Telford was to return to this material repeatedly.

In 1795, the bridge at [[Bewdley]] in [[Worcestershire]] was swept away in the winter floods and Telford was responsible for the design of its replacement. The same winter floods saw the bridge at [[Tenbury]] also swept away. This bridge across the [[River Teme]] was the joint responsibility of both Worcestershire and Shropshire and the bridge has a bend where the two counties meet. Telford was responsible for the repair to the northern (Shropshire) end of the bridge.

==Ellesmere Canal==
Telford's reputation in Shropshire led to his appointment in 1793 to manage the detailed design and construction of the [[Ellesmere Canal]], linking the ironworks and collieries of [[Wrexham]] via the north-west Shropshire town of [[Ellesmere, England|Ellesmere]], with [[Chester]], utilising the existing [[Chester Canal]], and then the [[River Mersey]].
[[File:pontcysyllte aqueduct arp.jpg|thumb|right|A canal boat traverses the [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct|Pontcysyllte aqueduct]]]]

Among other structures, this involved the spectacular [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]] over the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] in the Vale of [[Llangollen]], where Telford used a new method of construction consisting of troughs made from [[cast iron]] plates and fixed in masonry. Extending for over {{convert|1000|ft|m}} with an altitude of {{convert|126|ft|m}} above the valley floor, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct consists of nineteen arches, each with a forty-five foot span. Being a pioneer in the use of cast-iron for large scaled structures, Telford had to invent new techniques, such as using boiling sugar and lead as a sealant on the iron connections.
Eminent canal engineer [[William Jessop]] oversaw the project, but he left the detailed execution of the project in Telford's hands.  The aqueduct was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO-Pontcysyllte&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and Canal|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1303|website=UNESCO – World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Longden-on-Tern1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct]]]]
The same period also saw Telford involved in the design and construction of the [[Shrewsbury Canal]]. When the original engineer, Josiah Clowes, died in 1795, Telford succeeded him. One of Telford's achievements on this project was the design of [[Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct]], the cast-iron aqueduct at [[Longdon-on-Tern]], pre-dating that at Pontcysyllte, and substantially bigger than the UK's first cast-iron aqueduct, built by [[Benjamin Outram]] on the [[Derby Canal]] just months earlier. The aqueduct is no longer in use, but is preserved as a distinctive piece of canal engineering.

The Ellesmere Canal was completed in 1805 and alongside his canal responsibilities, Telford's reputation as a civil engineer meant he was constantly consulted on numerous other projects. These included water supply works for [[Liverpool]], improvements to London's docklands and [[London Bridge#.22New.22 .2819th-century.29 London Bridge|the rebuilding of London Bridge]] (c.1800).

Most notably (and again William Pulteney was influential), in 1801 Telford devised a master plan to improve communications in the [[Highlands of Scotland]], a massive project that was to last some 20 years. It included the building of the [[Caledonian Canal]] along the [[Great Glen]] and redesign of sections of the [[Crinan Canal]], some {{convert|920|mi|km}} of new roads, over a thousand new bridges (including the [[Craigellachie Bridge]]), numerous [[harbour]] improvements (including works at [[Aberdeen]], [[Dundee]], [[Peterhead]], [[Wick, Highland|Wick]], [[Portmahomack]] and [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]]), and 32 new churches.

Telford also undertook highway works in the Scottish Lowlands, including {{convert|184|mi|km}} of new roads and numerous bridges, ranging from a 112&amp;nbsp;ft (34&amp;nbsp;m) span stone bridge across the [[River Dee, Galloway|Dee]] at [[Tongueland]] in [[Kirkcudbright]] (1805–06) to the 129&amp;nbsp;ft (39&amp;nbsp;m) tall Cartland Crags bridge near [[Lanark]] (1822).

Telford was consulted in 1806 by the [[Gustaf IV Adolf of Sweden|King of Sweden]] about the construction of a canal between [[Gothenburg]] and [[Stockholm]]. His plans were adopted and construction of the [[Göta Canal]] began in 1810. Telford travelled to Sweden at that time to oversee some of the more important initial excavations.

Many of Telford's projects were undertaken due to his role as a member of the [[Exchequer Bill Loan Commission]], an organ set up under the [[Poor Employment Act]] of 1817, to help finance public work projects that would generate employment.&lt;ref name=&quot;engineering-timelines&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Telford_T/telfordThomas6.asp|title=Engineering Timelines – Thomas Telford|publisher=engineering-timelines.com|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 'Colossus of Roads'==
[[File:Menai Suspension Bridge.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Menai Suspension Bridge]]]]
During his later years, Telford was responsible for rebuilding sections of the [[Watling Street|London to Holyhead road]], a task completed by his assistant of ten years, [[John Benjamin Macneill|John MacNeill]]; today, much of the route is the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] trunk road, although the Holyhead Road diverted off the A5 along what is now parts of [[A45 road|A45]], [[A41 road|A41]] and [[A464 road|A464]] through the cities of [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Wolverhampton]]. Between London and Shrewsbury, most of the work amounted to improvements. Beyond Shrewsbury, and especially beyond Llangollen, the work often involved building a highway from scratch. Notable features of this section of the route include the
[[Waterloo Bridge, Betws-y-Coed|Waterloo Bridge]] across the [[River Conwy]] at [[Betws-y-Coed]], the ascent from there to [[Capel Curig]] and then the descent from the pass of [[Nant Ffrancon]] towards [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]]. Between [[Capel Curig]] and [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]], in the [[Ogwen Valley]], Telford deviated from the original road, built by Romans during their occupation of this area.

On the island of [[Anglesey]] a new [[Stanley Embankment|embankment]] across the Stanley Sands to Holyhead was constructed, but the crossing of the [[Menai Strait]] was the most formidable challenge, overcome by the [[Menai Suspension Bridge]] (1819–26). Spanning {{convert|580|ft|m}}, this was the longest suspension bridge of the time. Unlike modern suspension bridges, Telford used individually linked {{convert|9.5|ft|m|adj=on}} iron eye bars for the cables.

Telford also worked on the North Wales coast road between Chester and Bangor, including another major [[Conwy Suspension Bridge|suspension bridge]] at [[Conwy]], opened later the same year as its Menai counterpart.

Further afield Telford designed a road to cross the centre of the [[Isle of Arran]]. Named the 'String road', this route traverses bleak and difficult terrain to allow traffic to cross between east and west Arran avoiding the circuitous coastal route. His work on improving the Glasgow – Carlisle road, later to become the [[A74 road|A74]], has been described as &quot;a model for future engineers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mort&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Telford improved on methods for the building of [[macadam]] roads by improving the selection of stone based on thickness, taking into account traffic, alignment and slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Other military assignments===
On August 17, 1862, Wallace accepted a regiment command in the [[Department of the Ohio]] to help with the successful [[defense of Cincinnati]] during [[Braxton Bragg]]'s incursion into [[Kentucky]]. Next, Wallace took command of [[Camp Chase]], a prisoner-of-war camp at [[Columbus, Ohio]], where he remained until October 30, 1862. A month later Wallace was placed in charge of a five-member commission to investigate Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s conduct in response to the Confederate invasion of [[Kentucky]]. The commission criticized Buell for his retreat, but it did not find him disloyal to the Union. When the commission's work was completed on May 6, 1863, Wallace returned to Indiana to wait for a new command.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 127, 137–46.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-July 1863, while Wallace was home, he helped protect the railroad junction at [[North Vernon, Indiana]], from Confederate general [[Morgan's Raid|John Hunt Morgan's raid]] into southern Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 153–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monocacy===
{{Main|Battle of Monocacy}}
Wallace's most notable service came on Saturday, July 9, 1864 at the [[Battle of Monocacy]] part of the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Although Confederate General [[Jubal A. Early]] and an estimated 15,000 troops defeated Wallace's troops at Monocacy Junction, Maryland, forcing them to retreat to Baltimore, the effort cost Early a chance to capture [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace's men were able to delay the Confederate advance toward Washington for an entire day, giving the city time to organize its defenses. Early arrived in Washington at around noon on July 11, two days after defeating Wallace at Monocacy, the northernmost Confederate victory of the war,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; but Union reinforcements had already arrived at [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]] to repel the Confederates and force their retreat to Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 305; Stephens, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace, who had returned to active duty on March 12, 1864, assumed command of [[VIII Corps (Union Army)|VIII Corps]], which was headquartered in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 161–62, 164, 175; Boomhower, pp. 8, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, a combined Union force of approximately 5,800 men under Wallace's command (mostly hundred-days' men from VIII Corps) and a division under [[James B. Ricketts]] from [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] encountered Confederate troops at Monocacy Junction between 9 and 10 a.m.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wallace was uncertain whether Baltimore or Washington, D.C., was the Confederate objective, he knew his troops would have to delay the advance until Union reinforcements arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 185–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace's men repelled the Confederate attacks for more than six hours before retreating to Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 73; Stephens, pp. 196, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the battle Wallace informed Halleck that his forces fought until 5 p.m., but the Confederate troops, which he estimated at 20,000 men, had overwhelmed them. When Grant learned of the defeat, he named Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord|E. O. C. Ord]] as Wallace's replacement in command of VIII Corps. On July 28, after officials learned how Wallace's efforts at Monocacy helped save Washington D.C. from capture, he was reinstated as commander of VIII Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 201, 203, 205; Boomhower, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|Grant's memoirs]], he praised Wallace's delaying tactics at Monocacy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Early had been but one day earlier, he might have entered the capital before the arrival of the reinforcements I had sent.&amp;nbsp;... General Wallace contributed on this occasion by the defeat of the troops under him, a greater benefit to the cause than often falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to render by means of a victory.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, [http://www.bartleby.com/1011/57.html Chapter LVII, p. 13.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Later military service===
On January 22, 1865, Grant ordered Wallace to the [[Rio Grande]] in southern [[Texas]] to investigate Confederate military operations in the area. Although Wallace was not officially authorized to offer terms, he did discuss proposals for the surrender of the Confederate troops in the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]]. Wallace provided Grant with copies of his proposals and reported on the negotiations, but no agreement was made. Before returning to Baltimore, Wallace also met with Mexican military leaders to discuss the U.S. government's unofficial efforts to aid in expelling [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian's]] French occupation forces from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 212–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following President Lincoln's death on April 15, 1865, Wallace was appointed to the military commission that investigated the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln assassination conspirators]]. The commission, which began in May, was dissolved on June 30, 1865, after all eight conspirators were found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 219, 221–22; Morrow, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-August 1865, Wallace was appointed head of an eight-member military commission that investigated the conduct of [[Henry Wirz]], the Confederate commandant in charge of the South's [[Andersonville prison camp]]. The [[court-martial]] which took nearly two months, opened on August 21, 1865. At its conclusion Wirz was found guilty and sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=Eicher551/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 223, 226;  Boomhower, pp. 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1865, Wallace had accepted an offer to become a major general in the Mexican army, but the agreement, which was contingent upon his resignation from the U.S. Army, was delayed by Wallace's service on the two military commissions. Wallace tendered his resignation from the U.S. Army on November 4, 1865, effective November 30,&lt;ref name=Eicher773 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Mexico to assist the Mexican army. Although the [[Benito Juárez|Juárez]] government promised Wallace $100,000 for his services, he returned to the United States in 1867 in deep financial debt.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace received $15,000 from the Mexican government in 1882. See Stephens, pp. 215–17, 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and diplomatic career==
Wallace returned to Indiana in 1867 to practice law, but the profession did not appeal to him, and he turned to politics.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace made two unsuccessful bids for a seat in Congress (in 1868 and 1870), and supported Republican presidential candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in the 1876 election.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 229; Boomhower, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; As a reward for his political support, Hayes appointed Wallace as governor of the [[New Mexico Territory]], where he served from August 1878 to March 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 98, 101; Ferraro, p. 142; Morrow, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His next assignment came in March 1881, when Republican [[President of the United States|president]] [[James A. Garfield]] appointed Wallace to an overseas diplomatic post in [[Constantinople]], [[Turkey]], as [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|U.S. Minister]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Wallace remained in this post until 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 229–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territorial governor of New Mexico===
Wallace arrived in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on September 29, 1878, to begin his service as governor of the New Mexico Territory during a time of lawless violence and political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 97, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace was involved in efforts to resolve New Mexico's [[Lincoln County War]], a contentious and violent disagreement among the county's residents, and tried to end a series of Apache raids on territorial settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 229; Boomhower, p. 107; Ferraro, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, while living at the [[Palace of the Governors]] in Santa Fe, Wallace also completed the manuscript for ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 108; Morrow, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 1879, after previous efforts to restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings.&lt;ref name=Boom102&gt;Boomhower, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as [[Billy the Kid]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with Bonney, who had witnessed the murder of a Lincoln County lawyer named Huston Chapman. Wallace wanted him to testify in the trial of Chapman's accused murderers, but Bonney wanted Wallace's protection from his enemies and amnesty for his earlier crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for Bonney to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the Kid that he would be &quot;scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Utley, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20 Bonney agreed to provide grand jury testimony against those involved in Chapman's murder. Wallace arranged for a &quot;fake&quot; arrest and Bonney's detention in a local jail to assure his safety.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Bonney testified in court on April 14, as agreed. However, the local district attorney revoked Wallace's bargain and refused to set the outlaw free.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt; After spending several weeks in jail, Bonney escaped and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. He was shot and killed on July 14, 1881, by Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]], who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 106–07, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2010, on his last day in office, then-Governor [[Bill Richardson]] of New Mexico declined a pardon request from Bonney's supporters, citing a &quot;lack of conclusiveness and the historical ambiguity&quot; over Wallace's promise of amnesty. Descendants of Wallace and Garrett were among those who opposed the pardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marc Lacey|title=No Pardon for Billy the Kid|work=New York Times|date=December 31, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/01/us/01billy.html|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. diplomat in the Ottoman Empire===
[[File:Wallace Az indus herceg.png|thumb|200px|''The Prince of India'' (Hungarian edition, 1930s)]]

On May 19, 1881, Wallace was appointed U.S. Minister to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]], Turkey). Wallace remained at the diplomatic post until 1885, and became a trusted friend of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. When a crisis developed between the Turkish and British governments over control of Egypt, Wallace served as an intermediary between the sultan and [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], the British ambassador. Although Wallace's efforts were unsuccessful, he earned respect for his efforts and a promotion in the U.S. diplomatic service.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 112, 118, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, an editorial aimed at Wallace appeared in the newspaper ''[[Havatzelet]]'' (xiii. No. 6) titled &quot;An American and yet a Despot&quot;. The editorial caused the ''Havatzelet'' to be suspended and its editor [[Israel Dov Frumkin]] to be imprisoned for forty-five days by order from Constantinople, directed to the pasha of the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]]. The incident that led to the editorial was the dismissal, made at Wallace's request, of Joseph Kriger, the Jewish secretary and interpreter to the pasha of Jerusalem. Wallace complained that Kriger had failed to receive him with the honor due to his rank, and refused to issue any apology for the alleged shortcoming. ''Havatzelet'' claimed that the proceeding was instigated by missionaries, whom Wallace strongly supported.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolow, Sefer Zikkaron, pp. 175–80, Warsaw, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Wallace's diplomatic duties, which included protection of U.S. citizens and U.S. trade rights in the area, Wallace found time to travel and do historical research. Wallace visited [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area, the site for his novel, ''Ben-Hur'', and did research in Constantinople, the locale for ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell'', which he began writing in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 119, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The election of [[Grover Cleveland]], the Democratic candidate for president, ended Wallace's political appointment. He resigned from the U.S. diplomatic service on March 4, 1885.&lt;ref name=Boom122&gt;Boomhower, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The sultan wanted Wallace to continue to work in the Ottoman Empire, and even made a proposal to have him represent Ottoman interests in England or France, but Wallace declined and returned home to Crawfordsville.&lt;ref name=Boom122/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 230–31; Morrow, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==
Wallace confessed in his autobiography that he took up writing as a diversion from studying law. Although he wrote several books, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (1880), which established his fame as an author.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 11; Forbes, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, Wallace began writing his first novel, ''The Fair God'', but it was not published until 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular historical novel, with Cortez's conquest of Mexico as its central theme, was based on [[William H. Prescott]]'s ''History of the Conquest of Mexico''.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, p. 387; McKee, &quot;The Early Life of Lew Wallace&quot;, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace's book sold seven thousand copies in its first year. Its sales continued to rise after Wallace's reputation as an author was established with the publication of subsequent novels.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 90, and Morrow, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace wrote the manuscript for ''Ben-Hur'', his second and best-known novel, during his spare time at Crawfordsville, and completed it in Santa Fe, while serving as the territorial governor of New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrow15&gt;Morrow, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ben-Hur'', an adventure story of revenge and redemption, is told from the perspective of a Jewish nobleman named Judah Ben-Hur.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Wallace had not been to the [[Holy Land]] before writing the book, he began research to familiarize himself with the area's geography and its history at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C., in 1873.&lt;ref name=Morrow15/&gt; [[Harper (publisher)|Harper and Brothers]] published the book on November 12, 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 9, 91, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ben-Hur'' made Wallace a wealthy man and established his reputation as a famous author.&lt;ref name=Stephens229&gt;Stephens, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were slow at first; only 2,800 copies were sold in the first seven months after its release, but the book became popular among readers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 11, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1886, it was earning Wallace about $11,000 in annual royalties (equivalent to $290,000 in 2015 dollars),&lt;ref name=Stephens229/&gt; and provided Wallace's family with financial security.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1889, Harper and Brothers had sold 400,000 copies and the book had been translated into several languages.&lt;ref name=Boom111&gt;Boomhower, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, ''Ben-Hur'' became the best-selling American novel of the 19th century, surpassing Harriet Beecher Stowe's ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lew Wallace|title=''Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ'', with a New Introduction by Tim LaHaye|publisher=Signet Classic|year=2003|page=vii |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YMwjxK9vBVkC&amp;q=ben-hur&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0192831996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Lifson, an editor for ''Humanities'', identified it as the most influential Christian book of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt; Others named it one of the best-selling novels of all time.&lt;ref name=Boom111/&gt; At the time of ''Ben-Hur'''s one hundredth anniversary in 1980, it had &quot;never been out of print&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and had been adapted for the stage and several motion pictures.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 11, 138; Morrow, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; One historian, [[Victor Davis Hanson]], has argued that ''Ben-Hur'' drew from Wallace's life, particularly his experiences at Shiloh, and the damage it did to his reputation. The book's main character, Judah Ben-Hur, accidentally causes injury to a high-ranking Roman commander, for which he and his family suffer tribulations and calumny.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Davis Hanson|Hanson, Victor Davis]], (2003) ''Ripples of Battle: How Wars of the Past Still Determine How We Fight, How We Live, and How We Think'', Doubleday, {{ISBN|0-385-50400-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace wrote subsequent novels and biographies, but ''Ben-Hur'' remained his most important work. Wallace considered ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell'' (1893) as his best novel.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a biography of President [[Benjamin Harrison]], a fellow Hoosier and Civil War general, and ''The Wooing of Malkatoon'' (1898), a narrative poem. Wallace was writing his autobiography when he died in 1905. His wife Susan completed it with the assistance of [[Mary Hannah Krout]], another author from Crawfordsville. It was published posthumously in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 234, 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Wallace continued to write after his return from Turkey. He also patented several of his own inventions, built a seven-story apartment building in Indianapolis, [[The Blacherne]], and drew up plans for a private study at his home in Crawfordsville.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 126; Morsberger and Morsberger, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace remained active in veterans groups, including writing a speech for the dedication of the battlefield at the [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park|Chickamauga]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 232–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's elaborate writing study, which he described as &quot;a pleasure-house for my soul&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; served as his private retreat.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt; Now called the [[General Lew Wallace Study|General Lew Wallace Study and Museum]], it was built between 1895 and 1898, adjacent to his residence in Crawfordsville, and set in an enclosed park. The study along with three and one-half acres of its grounds were designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1590&amp;ResourceType=Building|title=General Lew Wallace Study|accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=National Historic Landmark Program, Quick Links|publisher=National Park Service|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231501/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1590&amp;ResourceType=Building|archivedate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property is operated as a museum, open to the public.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=George R.|author2=Ralph Christian |title=Wallace, Gen. Lew, Study NRHP Nomination Form|publisher=American Assoc. for State and Local History|year=1975|url={{NHLS url|id=76000013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace had a moat on two sides of the Study and stocked it so he could fish from the back porch and a landing. In winter, he would fire up the coal furnace in the Study basement and fish from the windows. He loved fishing so much he invented and patented a special traveler's fishing pole. After just a few years he had the moat drained as it was negatively affecting the Study foundation and he worried about his grandchildren and neighborhood children falling into the water.

On April 5, 1898, at the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]], Wallace, at age seventy-one, offered to raise and lead a force of soldiers, but the war office refused. Undeterred, he went to a local recruiting office and attempted to enlist as a private, but was rejected again, presumably because of his age.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 236; Boomhower, p. 129; Morrow, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's service at the battle of Shiloh continued to haunt him in later life. The debate persisted in book publications, magazine articles, pamphlets, speeches, and in private correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 231; Ferraro, pp. 143–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace attended a reunion at Shiloh in 1894, his first return since 1862, and retraced his journey to the battlefield with veterans from the 3rd Division. He returned to Shiloh for a final time in 1901 to walk the battlefield with David W. Reed, the Shiloh Battlefield Commission's historian, and others. Wallace died before the manuscript of his memoirs was fully completed, and it is unknown whether he would have revised his final account of the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 233–34, 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Wallace died at home in Crawfordsville, on February 15, 1905,{{r|swansburg20130326}} of [[atrophic gastritis]].&lt;ref&gt;The physician's cause of death on his death certificate is &quot;atrophy of stomach&quot;, which is consistent with documented reports of his health beginning in Fall 1904. See, {{cite news |title=General Lew Wallace dies at Indiana home |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 16, 1905 |page=9 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A1EF63D5912738DDDAF0994DA405B858CF1D3}} See also, Welsh, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; He was seventy-seven years old.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt; Wallace is buried in Crawfordsville Oak Hill Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 12, 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
[[File:Wallace NSHC.jpg|thumb|upright|Wallace's statue in the U.S. Capitol]]
Wallace was a man of many interests and a lifelong adventure seeker, who remained a persistent, self-confident man of action. He was also impatient and highly sensitive to personal criticisms, especially those related to his command decisions at Shiloh.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, pp. 149–50, 389–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Wallace's career in law and politics, combined with years of military and diplomatic service, he achieved his greatest fame as a novelist, most notably for his best-selling biblical tale, ''Ben-Hur''.

Following Wallace's death, the State of Indiana commissioned the sculptor [[Andrew O'Connor (sculptor)|Andrew O'Connor]] to create a [[Lew Wallace (O'Connor)|marble statue of Wallace]] dressed in a military uniform for the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] in the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]]. The statue was unveiled during a ceremony held on January 11, 1910.&lt;ref name=Boom138&gt;Boomhower, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace is the only novelist honored in the hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humanities&quot;/&gt; A bronze copy of the statue is installed on the grounds of Wallace's study in Crawfordsville.&lt;ref name=Boom138/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lew Wallace High School]] opened in 1926 at 415 West 45th Avenue in [[Gary, Indiana]]. On June 3, 2014, the Gary School Board voted 4 to 2 to close Lew Wallace, along with five other schools.&lt;ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
[[North American Soccer League|NASL]] Indianapolis-based team The [[Indy Eleven]] pays homage to the 11th Regiment of Indiana Volunteers, which fought for the Union Army during the Civil War. The inspiration for the name came from Donna Schmink, the Collection Manager at the Indiana War Museum, who, when asked by team officials for ideas on a team name connected to Indiana history, suggested &quot;the Eleventh&quot; in honor of the regiment that valiantly fought under the initial direction of Colonel Lew Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indyeleven.com/about-indy|title=About Indy Eleven {{!}} Indy Eleven|website=www.indyeleven.com|access-date=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is considered one of the greatest Italian actors and is often remembered as an extremely professional, versatile and magnetic interpreter, whose long career includes both important productions as well as dozens of ''divertissements'' (which made him greatly popular).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Markon.net srl |url=http://www.vittoriogassman.it/biografia.htm |title=Vittorio Gassman - Sito ufficiale |publisher=Vittoriogassman.it |access-date=2014-05-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503165619/http://www.vittoriogassman.it/biografia.htm |archive-date=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born in [[Genoa]] to a German father, Heinrich Gassmann (an engineer from [[Karlsruhe]]), and a [[Pisa]]n Jewish mother, Luisa Ambron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovguide.com/vittorio-gassman-9202a8c04000641f80000000000582db# |title=Vittorio Gassman Video &amp;#124; Celebrity Interview and Paparazzi |publisher=Ovguide.com |access-date=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still very young he moved to Rome, where he studied at the [[Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica Silvio D'Amico|Silvio D'Amico National Academy of Dramatic Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Markon.net srl |url=http://www.vittoriogassman.it/biografia.htm |title=Vittorio Gassman - Sito ufficiale |publisher=Vittoriogassman.it |access-date=2014-05-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503165619/http://www.vittoriogassman.it/biografia.htm |archive-date=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Gassman's debut was in [[Milan]], in 1942, with Alda Borelli in Niccodemi's ''La Nemica'' (theatre). He then moved to Rome and acted at the ''Teatro Eliseo'' joining [[Tino Carraro]] and [[Ernesto Calindri]] in a team that remained famous for some time; with them he acted in a range of plays from bourgeois comedy to sophisticated intellectual theatre. In 1946, he made his film debut in ''Preludio d'amore'', while only one year later he appeared in five films. In 1948 he played in ''[[Bitter Rice|Riso amaro]]''.

It was with [[Luchino Visconti]]'s company that Gassman achieved his mature successes, together with Paolo Stoppa, Rina Morelli and [[Paola Borboni]]. He played [[Stanley Kowalski]] in [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''Un tram che si chiama desiderio'' (''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]''), as well as in ''Come vi piace'' (''[[As You Like It]]'') by [[Shakespeare]] and ''Oreste'' (by [[Vittorio Alfieri]]). He joined the ''Teatro Nazionale'' with Tommaso Salvini, [[Massimo Girotti]], [[Arnoldo Foà]] to create a successful ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' (by [[Henrik Ibsen]]). With [[Luigi Squarzina]] in 1952 he co-founded and co-directed the ''Teatro d'Arte Italiano'', producing the first complete version of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in Italy, followed by rare works such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''Thyestes'' and [[Aeschylus]]'s ''The Persians''.
[[File:1957 Grolla d'oro - Vittorio Gassman, Giovanna Ralli and Alberto Lattuada.jpg|thumb|Gassman, [[Giovanna Ralli]] and [[Alberto Lattuada]] awarded at the 1957 [[Grolla d'oro]].]]

In 1956 Gassman played the title role in a production of ''[[Othello]]''. He was so well received by his acting in the television series entitled ''Il Mattatore'' (''Spotlight Chaser'') that &quot;Il Mattatore&quot; became the nickname that accompanied him for the rest of his life. Gassman's debut in the [[commedia all'italiana]] genre was rather accidental, in [[Mario Monicelli]]'s ''[[I soliti ignoti]]'' (''Big Deal on Madonna Street'', 1958). Famous movies featuring Gassman include: ''[[The Easy Life|Il sorpasso]]'' (1962), ''[[La Grande Guerra]]'' (1962), ''[[I mostri]]'' (1963), ''[[L'Armata Brancaleone]]'' (1966), ''[[Profumo di donna]]'' (1974) and ''[[C'eravamo tanto amati]]'' (1974).

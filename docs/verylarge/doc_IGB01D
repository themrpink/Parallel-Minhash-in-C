===2013 State of Palestine decree===
Following the successful passage of the [[#2012 United Nations observer state status|2012 United Nations status resolution]] which changed Palestine's status at the UN to that of observer state, on 3 January 2013, Abbas signed a [[President of the Palestinian National Authority|presidential]] decree 1/2013&lt;ref name=JohnVW /&gt; officially changing the name of the 'Palestinian Authority' to the 'State of Palestine' The decree stated that &quot;Official documents, seals, signs and letterheads of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] official and national institutions shall be amended by replacing the name ‘Palestinian National Authority’ whenever it appears by the name ‘State of Palestine’ and by adopting the emblem of the State of Palestine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2013/01/04/world/middleeast/ap-ml-palestinians.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0 |title=Fatah Rally in Gaza Looks Toward Unity With Hamas|date=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to international lawyer John V.

==Peace process==
===Oslo accords===
In the 1990s, outstanding steps were taken which formally began a process the goal of which was to solve the Arab–Israeli conflict through a [[two-state solution]]. Beginning with the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]] and culminating in the 1993 [[Oslo Accords|Oslo Peace Accords]] between Palestinians and Israelis, the peace process has laid the framework for Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and in Gaza. According to the Oslo Accords, signed by Yassir Arafat and then Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Israel would pull out of the Gaza Strip and cities in the West Bank. East Jerusalem, which had been annexed by Israel in 1980 was not mentioned in any of the agreements.
[[File:Restricted space in the West Bank, Area C.png|thumb|[[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]], controlled by Israel [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|under Oslo Accords]], in blue and red, in December 2011]]
Following the landmark accords, the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA) was established to govern those areas from which Israel was to pull out. The PNA was granted limited autonomy over a non-contiguous area, though it does govern most Palestinian population centers.

The process stalled with the collapse of the [[Camp David 2000 Summit between Palestinians and Israel]], after which the [[second Intifada]] broke out.

Israel ceased acting in cooperation with the PNA. In the shadow of the rising death toll from the violence, the [[United States]] initiated the [[Road Map for Peace]] (published on June 24, 2002), which was intended to end the Intifada by disarming the Palestinian terror groups and creating an independent Palestinian state. The Road Map has stalled awaiting the implementation of the step required by the first phase of that plan with then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon stating within weeks of the release of the final text that a settlement freeze, one of Israel's main requirements, would be &quot;impossible&quot; because of the need for settlers to build new houses and start families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3020335.stm|title=Powell visit highlights problems, 12/05/2003|work=BBC News|access-date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains stalled because of Israel's continuing refusal to comply with the requirement to freeze settlement expansion and the civil war between [[Hamas]] and [[Fatah]], except that on April 27, 2011 it was announced that Hamas and Fatah had reached a reconciliation agreement in a pact which was brokered by Egypt. Hamas, Fatah, and the other Palestinian political factions signed the reconciliation agreement in the official signing ceremony of that agreement which took place on May 4, 2011.

In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip as part of the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Disengagement Plan]].

In 2008, U.S.-brokered negotiations were ongoing between Palestinian Chairman Mahmoud Abbas and the outgoing Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert.

In 2011, [[Al Jazeera]] published thousands of classified documents that it had received from sources close to negotiators in the 2008 negotiation talks between Israeli Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. The documents, dubbed the [[Palestine Papers]], showed that in private the Palestinians had made major concessions on issues that had scuttled previous negotiations. Olmert also presented his ideas for the borders for a Palestinian state, dubbed the &quot;Napkin Map&quot; because of Abbas having to sketch the map on a napkin because Olmert refused to allow Abbas to keep a copy for further consideration. Olmert's proposal largely followed the route of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]], and placed all of the Israeli settlement blocs and East Jerusalem Jewish neighbourhoods under Israeli sovereignty. Israel would retain around 10% of the West Bank and in return the Palestinians would receive around 5% of Israeli territory adjacent to the southern West Bank and lands adjacent to the Gaza Strip.

===Direct talks in 2010===
{{main|Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in 2010}}
In early September 2010 the first peace talks since the Gaza war in 2009 were held in Washington DC between Israeli prime-minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. The pace of the talks were assessed by the US as &quot;break through&quot;. However, on 25 September Netanyahu did not renew a 10-month moratorium on settlement construction in the [[West Bank]], which brought him severe criticism from the United States, Europe and the United Nations. Abbas stated that Netanyahu could not be trusted as a 'true' peace negotiator if the freeze was not extended. Netanyahu's failure to uphold the commitments he made just a few weeks earlier &quot;to reaching a comprehensive peace agreement with Palestinians&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3961939,00.html |title=Netanyahu to US: I'm leading Israel's policy |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |access-date=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; through extending the term of moratorium has caused a ''de facto'' halt of peace negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3961142,00.html |title=Direct negotiations suspended |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |access-date=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2010, Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party, presented to the UN a ″[[Lieberman plan|peace plan]]″ according to which ″parts of Israel's territory populated predominantly by Israeli Arabs would be transferred to a newly created Palestinian state, in return for annexation of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and/or population swap″.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ravid |first=Barak |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/lieberman-presents-plans-for-population-exchange-at-un-1.316197 |title=Lieberman presents plans for population exchange at UN|work=Haaretz |date=28 September 2010 |access-date=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement came about while Israeli prime-minister Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Abbas were holding peace talks mediated by the United States. In the press conference on 28 September Netanyahu stated &quot;Israel, Palestinians can reach Middle-East peace in a year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mozgovaya |first=Natasha |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/netanyahu-israel-palestinians-can-reach-mideast-peace-in-a-year-1.316220 |title=Netanyahu: Israel, Palestinians can reach Mideast peace in a year |work=Haaretz |date=28 September 2010 |access-date=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Liberman's controversial proposal means that &quot;the conflict will not be solved within a year and that implementation of the peace agreement will take generations&quot;. Lieberman's proposal was viewed as undermining Netanyahu's credibility in the discussions and causing embarrassment for the Israeli government. According to a New York Jewish leader &quot;Every time when Lieberman voices skepticism for peace talks, he gives Abu Mazen [Abbas] and the Arab League an opportunity to reinforce their claim that Netanyahu isn't serious.&quot; On 29 September, while commenting on the Lieberman proposal Netanyahu said that &quot;I didn't see [the] speech beforehand, but I don't reject the idea.&quot;

The proposal also caused wide 'outrage' among Israelis and US Jews. [[Seymour Reich]], a former president of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations stated that &quot;If Lieberman can't keep his personal opinions to himself, he ought to resign from the cabinet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shamir |first=Shlomo |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/u-s-jews-outraged-by-lieberman-s-un-speech-on-population-exchange-1.316298 |title=U.S. Jews outraged by Lieberman's UN speech on population exchange.

===Positions===
[[File:Palestine recognition only.svg|thumb|300 px|International recognition of the State of Palestine]]

The main discussion since 1993 has focused on turning most or all of the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]] into an independent Palestinian state. This was the basis for the [[Oslo accords]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/nea/rls/22602.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is, as a matter of official policy, favoured by the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geneva.usmission.gov/press2004/0916Roadmap.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010191526/http://geneva.usmission.gov/press2004/0916Roadmap.htm |date=October 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of Israel within the [[1949 Armistice lines]] has not been the subject of international negotiations. Some members of the PLO recognize Israel's right to exist within these boundaries; others hold that Israel must eventually be destroyed.&lt;ref name=HamasC/&gt; Consequently, some Israelis hold that Palestinian statehood is impossible with the current PLO as a basis, and needs to be delayed.

Israel declares that its security demands that a &quot;Palestinian entity&quot; would not have all attributes of a state, at least initially, so that in case things go wrong, Israel would not have to face a dangerous and nearby enemy. Israel may be therefore said to agree (as of now) not to a complete and independent Palestinian state, but rather to a self-administering entity, with partial but not full sovereignty over its borders and its citizens.

The central Palestinian position is that they have already compromised greatly by accepting a state covering only the areas of the West Bank and Gaza. These areas are significantly less territory than allocated to the Arab state in UN [[UN General Assembly Resolution 181|Resolution 181]]. They feel that it is unacceptable for an agreement to impose additional restrictions (such as level of militarization, see below) which, they declare, makes a viable state impossible. In particular, they are angered by significant increases in the population of Israeli settlements and communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the interim period of the Oslo accords. Palestinians claim that they have already waited long enough, and that Israel's interests do not justify depriving their state of those rights that they consider important. The Palestinians have been unwilling to accept a territorially disjointed state.

==Plans for a solution==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2011}}
[[File:Trump Peace Plan Map.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Trump peace plan|Trump's peace plan]] for the creation of the [[State of Palestine]].]]
There are several plans for a possible Palestinian state. Each one has many variations. Some of the more prominent plans include:
*Creation of a Palestinian state out of the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]], with its capital in [[East Jerusalem]]. This would make the [[Green Line (Israel)|1949 Armistice lines]], perhaps with minor changes, into permanent ''[[de jure]]'' borders. This long-extant idea forms the basis of a [[Arab Peace Initiative|peace plan]] put forward by [[Saudi Arabia]] in March 2002, which was accepted by the [[Palestinian Authority]] and all other members of the [[Arab League]]. This plan promised, in exchange for withdrawal, complete recognition of and full diplomatic relations with Israel by the Arab world. Israel claims its security would be threatened by (essentially) complete withdrawal as it would return Israel to its pre-1967 10-mile [[strategic depth]]. The plan spoke only of a &quot;just settlement of the refugee problem&quot;, but insistence on a [[Palestinian right of return]] to the pre-1967 territory of Israel could result in two Arab states, one of them (pre-1967 Israel) with a significant Jewish minority, and another (the West Bank and Gaza) without Jews.
* Other, more limited, plans for a Palestinian state have also been put forward, with parts of Gaza and the West Bank which have been settled by Israelis or are of particular strategic importance remaining in Israeli hands. Areas that are currently part of Israel could be allocated to the Palestinian state in compensation. The status of Jerusalem is particularly contentious.
*A plan proposed by former Israeli tourism minister MK [[Binyamin Elon]] and popular with the Israeli right wing advocates the expansion of Israel up to the [[Jordan River]] and the &quot;recognition and development of Jordan as the Palestinian State&quot;.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The legitimacy for this plan leans on the fact that a large share of the Jordanian population has Palestinian roots, including [[List of kings of Jordan|King]] [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]]'s wife, [[Queen Rania of Jordan|Queen Rania]], as well as the fact that the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]] is composed of lands that until 1921 were part of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and thus was claimed by at least some Zionists (such as [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] and his [[Irgun|Etzel]]) as part of the &quot;Jewish national home&quot; of the Balfour Declaration. Palestinian residents of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and the [[West Bank]] would become citizens of Jordan and many would be settled in other countries. Elon claims this would be part of the [[population exchange]] initiated by the exodus &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/article/263 |title=Why Jews Fled the Arab Countries :: Middle East Quarterly |publisher=Meforum.org |access-date=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Jews from Arab states to Israel in the 1950s. See [[Elon Peace Plan]]. A September 2004 poll conducted by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies reported that 46% of Israelis support transferring the Arab population out of the territories and that 60% of respondents said that they were in favor of encouraging Israeli Arabs to leave the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;elon&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051127105105/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=140196&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0 More Israeli Jews favor transfer of Palestinians, Israeli Arabs - poll finds] Ha'aretz&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[RAND]] has proposed a solution entitled &quot;The Arc&quot; in which the West Bank is joined with Gaza in an infrastructural arc. The development plan includes recommendations from low level civic planning to banking reform and currency reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;randarc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9119/index1.html|title=The Arc: A Formal Structure for a Palestinian State|year=2005|publisher=RAND Corporation|access-date=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another plan which has gained some support is one where the [[Gaza Strip]] is given independence as a Palestinian enclave, with parts of the [[West Bank]] split between Israel and Jordan respectively. The Jerusalem problem may be addressed by administration by a third party such as the [[United Nations]] as put forward in their initial partition plan.

Several plans have been proposed for a Palestinian state to incorporate all of the former British mandate of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (pre-1967 territory of Israel, the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]]). Some possible configurations include:
*A secular Arab state (as described in the [[Palestinian National Covenant]] before the cancellation of the relevant clauses in 1998). Accordingly, only those &quot;Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the beginning of the Zionist invasion will be considered Palestinians&quot;, which excludes at least 90% of the Jewish population of Israel.
*A strictly Islamic state (advocated by [[Hamas]] and the Islamic Movement). This arrangement would face objection from the Jewish population as well as secular [[Muslims]], and non-Muslim Palestinians.
*A [[federation]] (likely [[consociationalism|consociational]]) of separate Jewish and Arab areas (some Israelis and [[Palestinians]]). It is not clear how this arrangement would distribute natural resources and maintain security.
*A single, [[Binational solution|bi-national state]] (advocated by various Israeli and Palestinian groups). Fears exist that the Palestinians may come to outnumber the Jews after a few years. Many Israelis are loath to live in a state where Jews no longer are the majority.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Such a configuration exists in Lebanon and Bosnia, but failed in Yugoslavia. Strong nationalist sentiment among many Israelis and Palestinians would be an obstacle to this arrangement.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} After what he perceived as the failure of the Oslo Process and the two-state solution, Palestinian-American professor [[Edward Said]] became a vocal advocate of this plan. &lt;!--does this belong here?--&gt;
*A [[United Arab Kingdom]] plan which returns Palestine to nominal Jordanian control under the supervision of a Hashemite monarch. This idea was first proposed by the late [[King Hussein]]. In October 2007, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah]] stated that the Palestinian independence must be achieved before Jordan will entertain expanding its role in Palestine beyond religious sites. This plan is buttressed by a Jordanian infrastructure, which is vastly superior to the 1948–1967 area with particular attention paid to tourism, health care, and education. A Palestinian state would rely heavily on tourism, which Jordan would assist with considerable experience and established departments.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Parties which recognise a Palestinian entity separate from Israel==
{{Main|International recognition of the State of Palestine}}
* There are conflicting reports about the number of countries that extended their recognition to the proclaimed State of Palestine. In Annex 2 of the [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000827/082711eo.pdf Request for the Admission of the State of Palestine to UNESCO] from 12 May 1982, several Arab and African countries provided a list of 92 countries allegedly having extended such recognition. In the same document (Corrigendum 1), it is requested that Austria be removed from the list. Namibia is listed even though it was not independent at the time. The list also includes a considerable number of states that ceased to exist during the 1990s, most notably the [[German Democratic Republic]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Democratic Yemen]], [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (today: [[Cambodia]]) and [[Zaire]] (today: [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). On 13 February 2008, The Palestinian Authorities' Minister of Foreign Affairs announced he could provide documents for the recognition of 67 countries in the proclaimed State of Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP)&amp;nbsp;– Feb 13, 2009 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g8_mQhPKa5f5urfm_o3_nYf_Y_Wg |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103131428/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g8_mQhPKa5f5urfm_o3_nYf_Y_Wg |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-03 |title=AFP: Palestinian ministers press for Israel 'war crimes' probe |date=2009-02-13 |access-date=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing countries that are known to have extended such recognition include most [[Arab League|Arab League nations]], most [[Africa]]n nations, and several [[Asia]]n nations, including [[China]] and [[India]].
*Many countries, including European countries, the [[United States]] and [[Israel]] recognize the [[Palestinian Authority]] established in 1994, as per the [[Oslo Accords]], as an autonomous geopolitical entity without extending recognition to the 1988 proclaimed State of Palestine.
*Since the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], the [[International Olympic Committee]] have recognized a separate [[Palestine Olympic Committee]] and Palestinian team. Two track &amp; field athletes, Majdi Abu Marahil and Ihab Salama, competed for the inaugural Palestinian team.
*Since 1998, football's world governing body [[FIFA]] have recognized the [[Palestine national football team]] as a separate entity. On 26 October 2008 Palestine played their first match at home, a 1–1 draw against [[Jordan national football team|Jordan]] in the [[West Bank]].

==Life and professional career==
Born somewhere around 1615 in [[Gdańsk]] (Danzig),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stefan Muthesius|title=Art, architecture and design in Poland, 966-1990: an introduction|year=1994 |editor= |page=43 |chapter= |url= |publisher=K.R.

Köster Verlagsbuchhandlung |location= |isbn=978-3-7845-7611-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Pomeranian Voivodeship,&lt;ref&gt;''Polnisch-Preußen'' - '''official name''' (legal name) in the original state document - ''State Constitution of the Polish-Prussia'' (see: [https://books.google.com/books?id=9RsVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA380&amp;dq=Constitution+Preussen&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1800&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Excerpt] in the publication of 1764, p. 581)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], Schultz learned the art of painting from his uncle, [[Daniel Schultz the Elder]], another important painter, working in his workshop for about five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz_pl&quot; /&gt; After his uncle's death he travelled to [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] to continue his studies for about three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz_pl&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Sokolnik Jana Kazimierza.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Crimean Falconer'' of King [[John II Casimir Vasa|John Casimir]], 1664]]

Schultz became the leading artist at the [[Warsaw]] court of the Polish kings in the second half of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz_pl&quot; /&gt; In 1649 he became a private painter to the Polish king [[John II Casimir Vasa]], and then to successor kings [[Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki|Michael Wiśniowiecki]] and [[John III Sobieski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz_pl&quot; /&gt; Schultz returned to his hometown around 1660, yet from time to time worked on royal commissions in Warsaw, often in the [[Wilanów Palace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz_pl&quot; /&gt; His great portraits of Polish kings and nobles are among the best examples of Baroque art in Poland. The most notable of his works ''Crimean Falconer of King John II Casimir with his Family '' (also known as ''The Family Portrait'', today in the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg) was painted in 1664.&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz_pl&quot; /&gt; It depicts [[Crimea]]n [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Agha]] Dedesh (or Dedis) with his sons and servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.schultz.pl/detale.php?a=da|title=Family Portrait of Dedesza Aga|work=www.schultz.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date=2003-07-03 |accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;krakowski&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Piotr Krakowski|title=Teoretyczne podstawy architektury wieku XIX, Wydania 14-16|year=1979 |editor= |page=63 |chapter= |url= |publisher=PWN |location= |isbn= |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eldest son of Agha was entitled ''Royal Falconer'' in reward for his father's support during the [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)|Polish war with Russia]] (1654–1667). This work was painted during Agha's visit to Warsaw after successful invasion of the [[Left-bank Ukraine]] (1663–1664).&lt;ref name=&quot;krakowski&quot; /&gt; Rich color variations of cerise, dark green and orange create an ideal composition with silver-brown tone of the painting. Some of the portraits of John II are also well known - ''en pied'' propaganda portrait in Polish costume, when he was leading the [[Battle of Berestechko|Berestechko expedition]] and so-called ''[[Bielany]] portrait'' in armour with black glow of burning [[Kraków]] in background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Zofia Baranowicz|author2=Aleksander Gieysztor|author2-link=Aleksander Gieysztor|author3=Janusz Durko|title=Warszawa, jej dzieje i kultura|year=1980 |editor=Aleksander Gieysztor |editor2=Janusz Durko |page=149 |chapter= |url= |publisher=Arkady |location= |isbn=978-83-213-2958-1 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His greatest activity occurred during the reign of John II.&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz_pl&quot; /&gt; At that time Schultz painted many [[portrait]]s and [[Christian art|religious paintings]]. For the abdicating king he painted [[Saint Casimir]], which was later displayed in the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] in [[Paris]] (missing).&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz_pl&quot; /&gt; After king's death, he painted his [[coffin portrait]] (now at the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] in Warsaw), that was later placed in the Marble Room at the Royal Castle among preserved 22 effigies of the [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish monarchs]] by [[Peter Danckerts de Rij]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz_pl&quot; /&gt; The inspirations of [[Rembrandt]] and [[Philippe de Champaigne]] are visible in his works. During his career at the court he probably had contact with some Rembrandt's works, as king John II was a passionate collector of [[Dutch School (painting)|Dutch paintings]] and by his agent in [[Amsterdam]], [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh]], he purchased many of his works (''The bath of Diana'', ''Actaeon'' among others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zbigniew Wójcik|title=Jan Kazimierz Waza|year=1997|editor=|page=[https://archive.org/details/jankazimierzwaza00wojc/page/186 186]|chapter=|url=https://archive.org/details/jankazimierzwaza00wojc/page/186|publisher=Zakład Narodowy im.

Schultz lived in Gdańsk at the same time as the&lt;!-- please no assertion of nationality here! --&gt;  engraver [[Jeremias Falck]] (ca. 1620–1664), who often engraved portraits after Schultz's paintings.

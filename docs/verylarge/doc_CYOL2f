The '''Virginia opossum''' (''Didelphis virginiana''), commonly known as the '''North American opossum''', is the only [[marsupial]] found north of Mexico. In the United States, the animal is typically referred to simply as a '''''possum'''''. It is a solitary and [[nocturnal animal]] about the size of a [[domestic cat]]. It is a successful [[Opportunism#Biological|opportunist]]. It is familiar to many North Americans as they frequently inhabit settled areas due to the associated proximity to food sources, notably trash cans.

==Name==
The Virginia opossum is the original animal named &quot;[[opossum]]&quot;. The word comes from [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] ''wapathemwa'' meaning &quot;white animal&quot;. Colloquially, the Virginia opossum is frequently called simply &quot;possum&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFM&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Florida's Fabulous Mammals|last=Gingerich|first=Jerry Lee|publisher=World Publications|year=1994|isbn=978-0-911977-13-4|location=Tampa, FL|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name opossum is applied more generally to any of the other marsupials of the families [[Didelphidae]] and [[Caenolestidae]].

The generic name (''Didelphis'') is derived from Ancient Greek: ''di'', &quot;two&quot;, and ''delphus'', &quot;womb&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Day |first=Leslie |title=Field Guide to the Natural World of New York City |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BoOGYeaQ64C&amp;pg=PT225 |date=10 May 2013 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-1-4214-1149-1 |page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Phalangeriformes|possums]] of [[Australia]], whose name is derived from a similarity to the opossums of the Americas, are also marsupials, but of the order [[Diprotodontia]].

The Virginia opossum is known in Mexico as ''tlacuache'', ''tacuachi'', and ''tlacuachi'', from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word ''tlacuatzin''.

==Range==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
The Virginia opossum's ancestors evolved in [[South America]], but spread into North America as part of the [[Great American Interchange]], which occurred mainly after the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] about 3 million years ago. ''Didelphis'' was apparently one of the later migrants, entering North America about 0.8 million years ago.&lt;ref name = &quot;Woodburne2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Woodburne|first1= M.O.|title=The Great American Biotic Interchange: Dispersals, Tectonics, Climate, Sea Level and Holding Pens|journal= Journal of Mammalian Evolution|volume= 17|issue= 4|date= 2010-07-14|pages= 245–264|doi= 10.1007/s10914-010-9144-8|pmid= 21125025|pmc= 2987556}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now found throughout [[Central America]] and [[North America]] east of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] from [[Costa Rica]] to southern [[Ontario]] and is expanding its range northward, northwesterly and northeasterly at a significant pace.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFM&quot; /&gt; Its pre-European settlement range was generally as far north as Maryland; southern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois; Missouri and Kansas. The clearing of dense forests in these areas and further north by settlers allowed the opossum to move northward. Since 1900, it has expanded its range to include most of New England (including Maine); New York State, extreme southwestern Quebec; most of southern and eastern Ontario; most of Michigan and Wisconsin; most of Minnesota, southeastern South Dakota and most of Nebraska. Areas such as Rhode Island and Waterloo Region and Simcoe County in southern Ontario rarely had sightings of opossums in the 1960s, but now have them regularly, some speculate that this is likely due to global warming causing winters to be warmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=L. L.|last2=Tucker|first2=P. K.|year=2017|title=Contemporary range expansion of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) impacted by humans and snow cover|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=96|issue=2|pages=107–115|doi=10.1139/cjz-2017-0071|hdl=1807/81311|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people speculate the expansion into Ontario mostly occurred by opossums accidentally being transferred across the St. Lawrence, Niagara, Detroit and St. Clair Rivers by motor vehicles or trains they may have climbed upon. As the opossum is not adapted to colder winters or heavy snow, its population may be significantly reduced if a colder winter with heavier snow occurs in a particular northern region.

The Virginia opossum was not originally native to the West Coast of the United States. It was intentionally introduced into the West&lt;ref name=&quot;FFM&quot; /&gt; during the [[Great Depression]], probably as a source of food,&lt;ref&gt;''The Opossum: Its Amazing Story'', William J. Krause and Winifred A. Krause, University of Missouri-Columbia, 2006, p. 23, {{ISBN|0-9785999-0-X}}, 9780978599904.&lt;/ref&gt; and now occupies much of the Pacific coast. Its range has been expanding steadily northward into British Columbia, [[Canada]].

==Description==
[[File:Opossum Skull.jpg|thumb|Skull of a Virginia opossum|alt=|left]]
Virginia opossums can vary considerably in size, with larger specimens found to the north of the opossum's range and smaller specimens in the tropics. They measure 13–37 [[inch|in]] (35–94 [[centimetre|cm]]) long from their snout to the base of the tail, with the tail adding another 8.5–19 in (21.6–47&amp;nbsp;cm). Weight for males ranges from 1.7 to 14&amp;nbsp;lb (0.8–6.4 [[kilogram|kg]]) and for females from 11 ounces to 8.2&amp;nbsp;lb (0.3–3.7&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Didelphis_virginiana.html|title=ADW: Didelphis virginiana: Information (1974-05-02)|website=animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu|access-date=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are one of the world's most variably sized mammals, since a large male from northern North America weighs about 20 times as much as a small female from the tropics. Their coats are a dull grayish brown, other than on their faces, which are white. Opossums have long, hairless, [[prehensile]] tails, which can be used to grab branches and carry small objects. They also have hairless ears and a long, flat nose. Opossums have [[dentition|50 teeth]], more than any other North American land mammal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.extension.illinois.edu/wildlife/directory_show.cfm?species=opossum Wildlife Directory: Virginia Opossum — Living with Wildlife — University of Illinois Extension].

Opossums have 13 [[nipple]]s, arranged in a circle of 12 with one in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcollections.fiu.edu/wild/transcripts/possums1.htm With the Wild Things - Transcripts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323001102/http://digitalcollections.fiu.edu/wild/transcripts/possums1.htm |date=2013-03-23 }}.

Virginia opossum tracks generally show five finger-like toes in both the fore and hind prints.&lt;ref name=Krause&gt;Krause, William J.; Krause, Winifred A. (2006).[https://web.missouri.edu/~krausew/Histology/Home_files/opossum.pdf  ''The Opossum: Its Amazing Story''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211214644/https://web.missouri.edu/~krausew/Histology/Home_files/opossum.pdf |date=2012-12-11 }}. Department of Pathology and Anatomical Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri. 80 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; The hind tracks are unusual and distinctive due to the opossum's opposable [[thumb]], which generally prints at an angle of 90° or greater to the other fingers (sometimes near 180°). Individual adult tracks generally measure 1.9 in long by 2.0&amp;nbsp;in wide (4.8 × 5.1&amp;nbsp;cm) for the fore prints and 2.5 in long by 2.3 in wide (6.4 × 5.7&amp;nbsp;cm) for the hind prints. Opossums have claws on all fingers fore and hind except on the two thumbs (in the photograph, claw marks show as small holes just beyond the tip of each finger); these generally show in the tracks. In a soft medium, such as the mud in this photograph, the foot pads clearly show (these are the deep, darker areas where the fingers and toes meet the rest of the hand or foot, which have been filled with plant debris by wind due to the advanced age of the tracks).

The tracks in the photograph were made while the opossum was walking with its typical pacing [[gait]]. The four aligned toes on the hind print show the approximate direction of travel.

In a pacing gait, the limbs on one side of the body are moved simultaneously, just prior to moving both limbs on the other side of the body. This is illustrated in the pacing diagram, which explains why the left-fore and right-hind tracks are generally found together (and vice versa). However, if the opossum were not walking (but running, for example), the prints would fall in a different pattern. Other animals that generally employ a pacing gait are [[raccoon]]s, [[bear]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[badger]]s, [[woodchuck]]s, [[porcupine]]s, and [[beaver]]s.

When pacing, the opossum's 'stride' generally measures from 7 to 10&amp;nbsp;in, or 18 to 25&amp;nbsp;cm (in the pacing diagram the stride is 8.5&amp;nbsp;in, where one grid square is equal to 1 in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). To determine the stride of a pacing gait, measure from the tip (just beyond the fingers or toes in the direction of travel, disregarding claw marks) of one set of fore/hind tracks to the tip of the next set. By taking careful stride and track-size measurements, one can usually determine what species of animal created a set of tracks, even when individual track details are vague or obscured.

[[File:PlayingPossum.jpg|thumb|When injured or threatened (e.g., by a dog), the Virginia opossum is known to [[feign death]] or &quot;play possum&quot;.|alt=]]

=== &quot;Playing possum&quot; ===
If threatened, an opossum will either flee or take a stand.

An early description of the opossum comes from explorer [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]], who wrote in ''Map of Virginia, with a Description of the Countrey, the Commodities, People, Government and Religion'' in 1608 that &quot;An Opassom hath an head like a Swine, and a taile like a Rat, and is of the bignes of a Cat. Under her belly she hath a bagge, wherein she lodgeth, carrieth, and sucketh her young.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080603030757/http://wordsmithradio.org/scripts/opossum.html Chrysti the Wordsmith &gt; Radio Scripts &gt; Opossum].

Around the turn of the 20th century, the opossum was the subject of numerous songs, including &quot;Carve dat Possum,&quot; a minstrel song written in 1875 by Sam Lucas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Carve dat possum|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sm1875.10894/|access-date=2020-11-09|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although it is widely distributed in the United States, the Virginia opossum's appearance in folklore and popularity as a food item has tied it closely to the American [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]]. In animation, it is often used to depict uncivilized characters or &quot;[[hillbilly|hillbillies]]&quot;. Not surprisingly, then, the Virginia opossum is featured in several episodes of the hit TV show ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', such as the &quot;Possum Day&quot; episode in 1965.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0522552/ Possum Day Episode of the Beverly Hillbillies]&lt;/ref&gt; The title character in [[Walt Kelly]]'s long-running comic strip ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' was an opossum.

'''''Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits''''' is the first [[compilation album]] from [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], released on June 14, 1972, two years after the duo had split.

The album is currently available on CD under [[Legacy Recordings|Legacy]]'s Playlist banner.

==Overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}

The album was a mix of original studio recordings and four previously unreleased live recordings. The album's minimalist packaging does not specifically date the latter; however, the live versions of &quot;For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her&quot; and &quot;[[Kathy Chitty|Kathy's Song]]&quot; included on ''Greatest Hits'' were also included on the 2008 album ''[[Live 1969]]''. The [[liner notes]] to ''Live 1969'' state that these two songs were both recorded at a November 1969 [[concert]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. According to the liner notes from ''[[Collected Works (Simon and Garfunkel album)|Collected Works]]'', however, the version of &quot;Kathy's Song&quot; was taken from a 1968 concert in [[Vermont]].

In a 1975 [[BBC Radio 1]] interview, Roy Halee identified this version of &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song&quot; as being from Simon &amp; Garfunkel's 1970 performance at [[Carnegie Hall]], &quot;the last concert they did together&quot; (prior to their disbanding later in 1970). A live version of &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; was also included on the album.

The remaining ten studio songs comprise nine singles released between 1965 and 1972, &quot;[[America (Paul Simon song)|America]]&quot; being issued as a single several years after its appearance as a track on the ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'' album, and one album track, &quot;[[Bookends (song)|Bookends]]&quot; (without its parent song &quot;Old Friends&quot;).

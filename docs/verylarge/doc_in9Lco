Since mid-2008, an IPsec Maintenance and Extensions (ipsecme) working group is active at the IETF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2015-10-26|url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ipsecme/charter/|title=ipsecme charter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2015-10-26|url=https://tools.ietf.org/wg/ipsecme/|title=ipsecme status}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged NSA interference==
In 2013, as part of  [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|Snowden leaks]], it was revealed that the US [[National Security Agency]] had been actively working to &quot;Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, networks, and endpoint communications devices used by targets&quot; as part of the [[Bullrun (code name)|Bullrun]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html|newspaper=New York Times|title=Secret Documents Reveal N.S.A. Campaign Against Encryption}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are allegations that IPsec was a targeted encryption system.&lt;ref name=&quot;gilmore_bullrun&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg12325.html|title=Re: [Cryptography] Opening Discussion: Speculation on &quot;BULLRUN&quot;|author=John Gilmore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OpenBSD IPsec stack came later on and also was widely copied.  In a letter which OpenBSD lead developer [[Theo de Raadt]] received on 11 Dec 2010 from Gregory Perry, it is alleged that Jason Wright and others, working for the FBI, inserted &quot;a number of [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]s and [[side channel]] key leaking mechanisms&quot; into the OpenBSD crypto code. In the forwarded email from 2010, Theo de Raadt did not at first express an official position on the validity of the claims, apart from the implicit endorsement from forwarding the email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=129236621626462&amp;w=2|title=Allegations regarding OpenBSD IPSEC|author=Theo de Raadt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Wright's response to the allegations: &quot;Every urban legend is made more real by the inclusion of real names, dates, and times. Gregory Perry's email falls into this category. … I will state clearly that I did not add backdoors to the OpenBSD operating system or the OpenBSD crypto framework (OCF).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=129244045916861&amp;w=2|title=Allegations regarding OpenBSD IPSEC|author=Jason Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some days later, de Raadt commented that &quot;I believe that NETSEC was probably contracted to write backdoors as alleged. … If those were written, I don't believe they made it into our tree.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/420858/|title=Update on the OpenBSD IPSEC backdoor allegation|author=Theo de Raadt}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was published before the Snowden leaks.

An alternative explanation put forward by the authors of the [[Logjam (computer security)|Logjam attack]] suggests that the NSA compromised IPsec VPNs by undermining the [[Diffie-Hellman]] algorithm used in the key exchange.  In their paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy.pdf|title=Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice|author1=David Adrian |author2=Karthikeyan Bhargavan |author3=Zakir Durumeric |author4=Pierrick Gaudry |author5=Matthew Green |author6-link=J. Alex Halderman|author6=J. Alex Halderman |author7=Nadia Heninger|author7-link= Nadia Heninger |author8=Drew Springall |author9=Emmanuel Thomé |author10=Luke Valenta |author11=Benjamin VanderSloot |author12=Eric Wustrow |author13=Santiago Zanella-Béguelink |author14=Paul Zimmermann }}&lt;/ref&gt; they allege the NSA specially built a computing cluster to precompute multiplicative subgroups for specific primes and generators, such as for the second Oakley group defined in RFC 2409.  As of May 2015, 90% of addressable IPsec VPNs supported the second Oakley group as part of IKE.  If an organization were to precompute this group, they could derive the keys being exchanged and decrypt traffic without inserting any software backdoors.

A second alternative explanation that was put forward was that the [[Equation Group]] used [[Zero-day (computing)|zero-day exploits]] against several manufacturers' VPN equipment which were validated by [[Kaspersky Lab]] as being tied to the Equation Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/code-dumped-online-came-from-omnipotent-nsa-tied-hacking-group/ | title = Confirmed: hacking tool leak came from &quot;omnipotent&quot; NSA-tied group | first = Dan | last = Goodin | date = August 16, 2016 | access-date = August 19, 2016 | newspaper = Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; and validated by those manufacturers as being real exploits, some of which were zero-day exploits at the time of their exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/08/17/cisco_two_shadow_brokers_vulnerabilities_real/ | first = Iain | last = Thomson | title = Cisco confirms two of the Shadow Brokers' 'NSA' vulns are real | date = August 17, 2016 | access-date = September 16, 2016 | newspaper = [[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Equation Group exploit hits newer Cisco ASA, Juniper Netscreen | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/08/24/equation_group_exploit_expanded_to_target_cisco_924_asa_boxes/ | first = Darren | last = Pauli | date = August 24, 2016 | access-date=September 16, 2016 | newspaper = [[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/08/18/fortinet_follows_cisco_in_confirming_shadow_broker_vuln/ | title = Fortinet follows Cisco in confirming Shadow Broker vuln | first = Richard | last = Chirgwin | newspaper = [[The Register]] | date = August 18, 2016 | access-date = September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cisco PIX#Security vulnerabilities|Cisco PIX and ASA]] firewalls had vulnerabilities that were used for wiretapping by the NSA{{citation-needed|date=April 2020}}.

Furthermore, IPsec VPNs using &quot;Aggressive Mode&quot; settings send a hash of the PSK in the clear. This can be and apparently is targeted by the NSA using offline dictionary attacks.&lt;ref&gt;https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy-ccs15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/27404 What are the problems of IKEv1 aggressive mode (compared to IKEv1 main mode or IKEv2)?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nohats.ca/wordpress/blog/2014/12/29/dont-stop-using-ipsec-just-yet/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telluride''' is the [[county seat]] and most populous town of [[San Miguel County, Colorado|San Miguel County]] in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GR6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|access-date=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The town is a former [[silver]] [[mining]] camp on the [[San Miguel River (Colorado)|San Miguel River]] in the western [[San Juan Mountains]]. The first gold mining claim was made in the mountains above Telluride in 1875, and early settlement of what is now Telluride followed. The town itself was founded in 1878 as &quot;Columbia&quot;, but due to confusion with a California town of the same name, was renamed Telluride in 1887 for the [[gold telluride]] minerals found in other parts of Colorado. These telluride minerals were never found near Telluride, but the area's mines for some years provided zinc, lead, copper, silver, and other gold ores.

Telluride sits in a [[Canyon|box canyon]]. Steep forested mountains and cliffs surround it, with [[Bridal Veil Falls (Telluride)|Bridal Veil Falls]] situated at the canyon's head. Numerous weathered ruins of old mining operations dot the hillsides. A free [[Gondola lift|gondola]] connects the town with its companion town, [[Mountain Village, Colorado]], at the base of the ski area. Telluride and the surrounding area have featured prominently in popular culture, and it is the subject of several popular songs. It is especially known for its [[ski resort]] and slopes during the winter, as well as an extensive festival schedule during the summer.

The [[Telluride Historic District]], which includes a significant portion of the town, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is also one of [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Colorado|Colorado's 20 National Historic Landmarks]]. The town population was 2,325 in the [[2010 United States Census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php | title = 2010 Census Interactive Population Search | publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division | access-date = January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Gold-245690.jpg|thumb|Historic gold specimen from Telluride]]

===Mining days===
Gold was first discovered in Colorado near present-day Denver, setting off the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush|Pike's Peak gold rush of 1858]]. The Smuggler gold vein above Telluride, and placer gold in the [[San Miguel River (Colorado)|San Miguel River]], were discovered in 1875.&lt;ref name=Voynick&gt;Voynick, S.M., 1992, Colorado Gold, Missoula: Mountain Press Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0878424555}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51,54}}  John Fallon made the first claim in Marshal Basin above Telluride in 1875 and early settlement of Telluride followed. The town itself was founded in 1878. Telluride was originally named &quot;Columbia&quot;, but due to confusion with [[Columbia, California|Columbia]], [[California]], the name was changed by the [[post office]] in 1887. The town was named after valuable ore compounds of the [[chemical element]] [[tellurium]], a [[metalloid]] element which forms natural [[telluride (chemistry)|tellurides]], the most notable of which are telluride ores of gold and silver. Although [[gold telluride]] minerals were never actually found in the mountains near Telluride, the area's [[Mining|mines]] were rich in [[zinc]], [[lead]], [[copper]], silver, and ores which contained gold in other forms.

Telluride began slowly because of its isolated location. In 1881, a [[toll road]] was opened by [[Otto Mears]] which allowed wagons to go where only pack [[mule]]s could go before. This increased the number of people in Telluride, but it was still expensive to get gold-rich [[ore]] out of the valley.

In June 1889, [[Butch Cassidy]], before becoming associated with his gang, &quot;the wild bunch&quot;, robbed the San Miguel Valley Bank in Telluride. This was his first major recorded crime. He exited the bank with [[US$|$]]24,580, and later became famous as a bank robber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/old-text-wrinkles-did-butch-cassidy-survive-083206159.html|access-date=August 15, 2011|title=Old text, new wrinkles: Did Butch Cassidy survive?|agency=Associated Press|first=Mead|last=Gruver|date=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, the [[Rio Grande Southern]] [[railroad]], also begun by Mears, arrived in Telluride, eventually building a two stall engine house, water facilities, a section house and a bunkhouse, sidings and a depot. It continued further up the valley to end its Telluride branch at Pandora, serving the mines and the town until 1952. The cheaper and consistent transportation for passengers and freight allowed miners and goods to flow into the San Miguel town and ore to flow out to the mills and foundries elsewhere. This brought a brief but unprecedented boom to Telluride before the [[Panic of 1893]].&lt;ref name=NGC_Telluride&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Jerry|title=Telluride, Colorado – Mile Post 45.1 – Elev. 8,756ft|url=http://www.narrowgauge.org/ngc/html/excursion1/excursion1-telluride.html|work=The Narrow Gauge Circle|publisher=Mark L. Evans|access-date=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the turn of the 20th century, there were serious [[trade union|labor disputes]] in the mines near Telluride. The [[Colorado National Guard]] was called out and there were deaths on both sides. [[trade union|Unions]] were formed as miners joined the [[Western Federation of Miners]] in 1896. 1899 brought big changes as union [[strike action]] led most mines to grant miners $3 a day for an 8-hour day’s work plus a boarding pay of $1 a day. At this time, workers were putting in 10- to 12-hour days and the mines ran 24 hours a day. [[Occupational safety and health|Work conditions]] were treacherous, with mines above 12,000&amp;nbsp;ft, a lack of safety measures, and bitter weather in winter months. Even the [[boarding houses]] were precariously placed on the mountainsides.

[[File:Bridal Veil Falls Telluride CO.jpg|thumb|left|Bridal Veil Falls in Telluride]]
Telluride's labor unrest occurred against the backdrop of a statewide struggle between miners and mine owners. [[Bulkeley Wells]] was one mine operator considerably hostile to the union. The Telluride Miners' Union was led by [[Vincent Saint John|Vincent St. John]]. The disappearance of mine guard [[William J. Barney]], which Wells declared a &quot;murder&quot;, created much intrigue and national interest. The accusations, animosity, [[gun]]play, and expulsions which followed were part of an ongoing struggle throughout Colorado's mining communities which came to be called the [[Colorado Labor Wars]].

In 1891, Telluride's [[L.L. Nunn]] joined forces with [[George Westinghouse]] to build the [[Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant]], an [[alternating current]] [[power plant]], near Telluride. (Nunn's home can be found at the corner of Aspen and Columbia Streets; next door is the home he purchased for the &quot;pinheads&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} to study hydro-electric engineering.) The plant supplied power to the [[2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill|Gold King Mine]] 3.5 miles away. This was the first successful demonstration of long-distance transmission of industrial-grade alternating current power and used two 100-hp Westinghouse alternators, one working as a generator producing 3,000 volt, 133 Hertz, single-phase AC, and the other used as an AC motor.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=31O4upzTHQwC&amp;q=In+1891+Telluride+westinghouse+induction+motor&amp;pg=PA39|title=The Foundations of Vacuum Coating Technology|first=D. M.|last=Mattox|date=15 January 2013|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780080947051|access-date=26 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hydroelectric AC power plant predated the Westinghouse plant at [[Niagara Falls]] by 4 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; Nunn and his brother Paul built power plants in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Mexico, and the Ontario Power plant at Niagara Falls on the Canadian side. Nunn developed a keen interest in education as part of his electrical power companies, and in conjunction with Cornell University built the [[Telluride House]] at Cornell in 1909 to educate promising students in [[electrical engineering]]. Later, Nunn along with [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]], started the non-profit [[Telluride Association]]. Nunn founded [[Deep Springs College]] in 1917. All of Nunn's educational endeavors are going strong today. Each year, the Telluride Tech Festival honors Nunn, inventor [[Nikola Tesla]], and Westinghouse, along with current day technology and science leaders.

Telluride's most famous historic mines are the Tomboy, Pandora, Smuggler-Union, Nellie, and Sheridan mines. Beginning in 1939, the hard-rock mining operations in the Red Mountain and Telluride mining districts began a lengthy [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] under the [[Idarado Mine|Idarado Mining Company]] (Idarado), now a division of [[Newmont Mining]]. The consolidation ended in 1953 with Idarado’s acquisition of the Telluride Mines. Idarado kept the underground workings and mill operations open at Telluride’s Pandora hard-rock mine until 1978. When the mine officially closed, the [[snow]] which tormented Telluride's miners became the town's new source of income, in the form of [[skiing]] and tourism. The documentary video &quot;the YX factor&quot; chronicles the transition from mining to skiing and the influx of &quot;[[hippies]]&quot; in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the words of local residents and commentators such as [[Peter Yarrow]] and [[Tom Hayden]].

[[File:AERIAL VIEW OF TELLURIDE SHOWING NEWLY-CUT SKI TRAILS (IN RIGHT FOREGROUND - NARA - 543746.jpg|thumb|upright|Aerial view of newly cut Boomerang Road (May 1972).]]

===Skiing era===
Mining was Telluride’s only industry until 1972, when the first [[Chairlift|ski lift]] was installed by [[Telluride Ski Resort]] founder [[Joseph T. Zoline]] and his Telluride Ski Corporation (Telco). Zoline bought the land for the future resort in 1969 and began to craft the slopes. Along with his mountain manager, Telluride native Bill &quot;Sr.&quot; Mahoney, they slowly and thoughtfully put together a plan for sustained development of Telluride and the region. As mining phased out and a new service industry phased in, the local population changed sharply. Mining families fled Telluride to settle in places like [[Moab, Utah]], where uranium mining offered hope of continued employment. Mining families were replaced by what locals referred to as &quot;[[hippie]]s&quot;, young people with a 1960s worldview that often clashed with the values of Telluride's old-timers. These newcomers were characterized as idle &quot;trustfunders&quot; drawn to the town for a casual lifestyle and outdoor excitements such as [[hang gliding]], [[Mountaineering|mountain climbing]], and [[kayaking]].
[[File:Tel2wall.jpg|thumb|A view in Telluride from the ski slopes by Mountain Village.]]
The new population opposed town growth and economic expansion, including growth due to tourism and skiing. At one point, a serious effort was made to ban cars from the city limits and force visitors to use horse-drawn carts. The 1970s had fluctuating snowfalls and economic recession, but the town's music and film festivals flourished. They exposed hundreds of thousands to the grandeur of the valley for the first time and created iconic associations with elite entertainers. Meanwhile, ski area founder Joe Zoline worked to develop one of the best mountains in North America for expert skiers,{{fact|date=July 2020}} and created infrastructure for tourism that respected Telluride's need to stay small.{{fact|date=July 2020}}

As the final ore carts were rolling out of the Pandora mine, tourists began to discover Telluride's views, skiing, and autumn color changes. After the brutal snow drought of 1976 nearly wiped out the embryonic ski and lodging industry, the town started to rebound economically. In 1978, Ron Allred and his partner Jim Wells bought a stake of the ski area to form the Telluride Company. They expanded the infrastructure by adding a gondola connecting Telluride with the Mountain Village.

The [[Grateful Dead]] played Telluride on 8/16/87 and 8/17/87 riding the recent success of [[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)]].

During the 1980s, Telluride developed a reputation as &quot;Colorado's best-kept secret&quot;, which paradoxically made it one of the better-known resort communities. Wealthy skiers flocked to the mountain all winter, and sightseers kept hotel rooms full all summer. Telluride also became notorious in the drug counterculture as a drop point for Mexican smugglers and a favorite place for wealthy importers to enjoy downtime. The town was even featured in the hit song by [[Glenn Frey]] from ''[[Miami Vice]]'', &quot;Smugglers Blues&quot;.  Telluride was living up to its Wild West history. This type of attention helped differentiate it from [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]]. The festivals and Telluride's bad-boy image attracted celebrities like [[Tom Cruise]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], and [[Oliver Stone]]. By the mid-1990s, Telluride had shed both its mining personality and drug image to establish itself as a premier resort town balancing modern culture with fascinating western history. In 2003, Prospect Bowl, an extension to the ski area opened, providing the resort with many new trails and runs. In 2007–08, the ski area opened some of the most extreme, in-bound, hike-to terrain in the country. Most lifts in the area are high-speed quad chairs capable of holding four passengers. The highest lift on the mountain reaches 12,570 feet.
[[File:Telluride from gondola.jpg|thumb|right|Telluride from a gondola ascending to Mountain Village.]]

Telluride has a [[free box]] that is well supported by the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lise |last=Waring |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |title=The Free Box Provides |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lise-waring/the-free-box-provides_b_603900.html |date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Telluride has an elevation of {{convert|8750|ft}} in an isolated spot in Southwest Colorado. From the west, Colorado Route 145 is the most common way into Telluride; two other passes enter the town, [[Imogene Pass]] and [[Black Bear Road|Black Bear Pass]].

On the eastern side of town, there are two waterfalls: Ingram Falls, which is visible from town, and [[Bridal Veil Falls (Telluride)|Bridal Veil Falls]] and the Bridal Veil Hydroelectric plant, which are just out of sight from town to the right of Ingram. The power plant house was leased for a period of time by Eric Jacobson, who restored the house and the generator inside. The hydroelectric plant was built in 1895 to power the Smuggler-Union Mine.

The town is served by air transportation via [[Telluride Regional Airport]] (TEX), once the highest elevation commercial airport in the United States at 9,070 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/20/aspen-telluride-airport-landings/|title=Aspen, Telluride make list of America's most white-knuckle airport landings|date=20 March 2017|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport is considered challenging by pilots because of frequent adverse weather conditions, high elevation, and the extremely rugged mountain terrain surrounding the airport on nearly all sides. Major airline service is provided seasonally into Montrose (MTJ), approximately {{convert|70|mi}} north by road.

===Climate===
Telluride has a [[humid continental climate]] (Dfb). The coldest month is January, averaging {{convert|21|F|C}}, and the hottest July, which averages {{convert|59.9|F|C}}. Precipitation peaks as snow in winter and as thunderstorms in summer with a dry period in late spring. Telluride gets decent precipitation all year due to its altitude, averaging {{convert|23|in|cm|abbr=}} of rain and {{convert|177|in|cm|abbr=}} inches of snow per year.

Beyond the ski lifts, Telluride is now widely recognized as an all-season resort. Telluride Ski Resort is the main attraction in the winter. But when summer comes around, Telluride transforms into an outdoor recreation hot spot, with tourists visiting to enjoy [[mountain biking]], [[hiking]], river rafting, [[sightseeing]] and more. The Telluride Tourism Board promotes tourism in the region.

Telluride features over 30 hiking trails ranging in difficulty level. Some of the hiking routes include Ajax Peak, Bear Creek Falls, Hope Lake, and Bridal Veil Falls. Hiking season begins in May and lasts until early October, with waterfalls gushing in June and wildflowers at their peak in early July. The trails range from quick and easy runs to multi-day hiking trips that reach an elevation of 14,000 feet. Nearly all the trails feature waterfalls, wildflowers, and high alpine lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telluride.com/activities/hikingrunning|title=Hiking and Running|last=Telluride.com|website=www.telluride.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telluride is also home to many endurance events. The [[Hardrock 100]], held in July, has a major aid station in the town park. The Fall Tilt, a 12-hour downhill mountain biking event, is held in Mountain Village each September. And the 40-mile Telluride Mountain Run loops the town in a wide swath that includes some of the most difficult and scenic trails in the area.

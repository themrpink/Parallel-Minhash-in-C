This sort of argument has no effect on the expansionist, because he believes that we have magnificently succeeded in our problem, in spite of failures, neglects, and violations of our own principles, and because what he wishes to do is, not to abandon the experiment, but, inspired by the successes of the past, extend the Pax Americana over lands not included in this continent.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin for &quot;American Peace&quot;, modeled after ''[[Pax Romana]]'' and ''[[Pax Britannica]]''; also called [[Long Peace|the Long Peace]]) is a term applied to the concept of relative [[peace]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and later the world after the end of World War II in 1945, when the  [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Pax+Americana|title=Definition of PAX AMERICANA|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the world's dominant economic and military power. 

In this sense, ''Pax Americana'' has come to describe the military and economic position of the United States relative to other nations.  The [[Marshall Plan]], which spent $13 billion after World War II to rebuild the economies of [[Western Europe]], has been described by some as &quot;the launching of the Pax Americana&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Mee, ''The Marshall Plan: The launching of the pax americana'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early period ==
{{Main|Gilded Age}}
{{See also|History of the United States (1865–1918)|Territorial changes of the United States|Overseas expansion of the United States}}
The first articulation of a ''Pax Americana'' occurred after the end of the [[American Civil War]] (in which the United States both squashed its greatest disunity and demonstrated the ability to field millions of well-equipped soldiers utilizing modern tactics) with reference to the peaceful nature of the North American geographical region, and was abeyant at the commencement of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Its emergence was concurrent with the development of the idea of [[American exceptionalism]]. This view holds that the U.S. occupies a special niche among [[developed nation]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagehistory.net/gildedage/documents/TurnerFT.html |title=sagehistory.net |publisher=sagehistory.net |accessdate=2014-07-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629043938/http://sagehistory.net/gildedage/documents/TurnerFT.html |archive-date=June 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of its national [[credo]], historical evolution, political and religious institutions, and unique origins. The concept originates from [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref name=&quot;politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225014354/http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-02-25|title=American Exceptionalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; who asserted that the then-50-year-old United States held a special place among nations because it was a country of [[immigrants]] and the first [[modern democracy]]. From the establishment of the United States after the [[American Revolution]] until the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[foreign policy of the United States]] had a regional, instead of global, focus. The Pax Americana, which the Union enforced upon the states of central North America, was a factor in the United States' national [[prosperity]]. The larger states were surrounded by smaller states, but these had no anxieties: no standing armies to require taxes and hinder labor; no wars or rumors of wars that would interrupt trade; there is not only peace, but security, for the Pax Americana of the Union covered all the states within the [[Federation|federal]] constitutional republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;LalorCyclopaedia&quot;&gt;Lalor, John J., ''Cyclopaedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States''. Chicago: Rand, McNally, 1884. &quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OC0QAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA959 The Union]&quot;, p. 959.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first time the phrase appeared in print was in the August 1894 issue of ''Forum'': &quot;The true cause for exultation is the universal outburst of patriotism in support of the prompt and courageous action of President Cleveland in maintaining the supremacy of law throughout the length and breadth of the land, in establishing the ''pax Americana''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00344727?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Pax+Americana&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|title=Help – Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:10kMiles.JPG|thumb|right|1898 [[political cartoon]]: &quot;Ten Thousand Miles From Tip to Tip&quot; meaning the extension of U.S. domination (symbolized by a [[bald eagle]]) from [[Puerto Rico]] to the [[Philippines]].]]
[[File:Roosevelt monroe Doctrine cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|1906 political cartoon depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] using the Monroe Doctrine to keep European powers out of the [[Dominican Republic]].]]
With the [[rise of the New Imperialism#New Imperialism and the emerging empires|rise of the New Imperialism]] in the Western hemisphere at the end of the 19th century, debates arose between [[imperialism|imperialist]] and [[isolationism|isolationist]] factions in the U.S. Here, ''Pax Americana'' was used to connote the peace across the United States and, more widely, as a Pan-American peace under the aegis of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Those who favored traditional policies of avoiding foreign entanglements included labor leader [[Samuel Gompers]] and steel tycoon [[Andrew Carnegie]]. American politicians such as [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], [[William McKinley]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] advocated an aggressive foreign policy, but the administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]] was unwilling to pursue such actions. On January 16, 1893, U.S. diplomatic and military personnel conspired with a small group of individuals to [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow the constitutional government]] of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] and establish a [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|Provisional Government]] and then a [[Republic of Hawaii|republic]]. On February 15, they presented a treaty for annexation of the Hawaiian Islands to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], but opposition to annexation stalled its passage. The United States finally opted to annex Hawaii by way of the [[Newlands Resolution]] in July 1898.

After its victory in the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898 and the subsequent acquisition of [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Guam]], the United States had gained a [[colonial empire]]. By ejecting Spain from the Americas, the United States shifted its position to an uncontested regional power, and extended its influence into [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. Although U.S. capital investments within the Philippines and Puerto Rico were relatively small, these colonies were strategic outposts for expanding trade with Latin America and Asia, particularly [[China]]. In the Caribbean area, the United States established a [[sphere of influence]] in line with the Monroe Doctrine, not explicitly defined as such, but recognized in effect by other governments and accepted by at least some of the republics in that area.&lt;ref name=&quot;KirkpatrickWar&quot;&gt;Kirkpatrick, F. A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XtFCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 ''South America and the War'']: Being the Substance of a Course of Lectures Delivered in the University of London, King's College Under the Tooke Trust in the Lent Term, 1918. Cambridge [England]: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The events around the start of the 20th century demonstrated that the United States undertook an obligation, usual in such cases, of imposing a &quot;Pax Americana&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;KirkpatrickWar&quot; /&gt; As in similar instances elsewhere, this Pax Americana was not quite clearly marked in its geographical limit, nor was it guided by any theoretical consistency, but rather by the merits of the case and the test of immediate expediency in each instance.&lt;ref name=&quot;KirkpatrickWar&quot; /&gt; Thus, whereas the United States enforced a peace in much of the lands southward from the Nation and undertook measures to maintain internal tranquility in such areas, the United States on the other hand withdrew from interposition in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;KirkpatrickWar&quot; /&gt;

European powers largely regarded these matters as the concern of the United States. Indeed, the nascent Pax Americana was, in essence, abetted by the policy of the United Kingdom, and the preponderance of global [[sea power]] which the [[British Empire]] enjoyed by virtue of the strength of the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Bernard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=m38uhldLcGsC ''Empire and Superempire: Britain, America and the World'']. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Preserving the [[freedom of the seas]] and ensuring naval dominance had been the policy of the British since victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. As it was not in the interests of the United Kingdom to permit any European power to interfere in Americas, the Monroe Doctrine was indirectly aided by the Royal Navy. British commercial interests in South America, which comprised a valuable component of the [[Informal Empire]] that accompanied Britain's imperial possessions, and the economic importance of the United States as a trading partner, ensured that intervention by Britain's rival European powers could not engage with the Americas.

The United States lost its Pacific and regionally bounded nature towards the end of the 19th century. The government adopted [[protectionism]] after the [[Spanish–American War]] and built up the navy, the &quot;[[Great White Fleet]]&quot;, to expand the reach of U.S. power. When Theodore Roosevelt became [[President of the United States|President]] in 1901, he accelerated a foreign policy shift away from isolationism towards foreign intervention which had begun under his predecessor, [[William McKinley]]. The [[Philippine–American War]] arose from the ongoing [[Philippine Revolution]] against [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11635503|year=1984|last1=Gates|first1=J.

By 1900, the United States possessed the world's largest industrial capacity and national income, having surpassed both the United Kingdom and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers.&quot; Vintage, January 1989. United States is listed as possessing 23.6% of world industrial capacity compared to 18.5% for the British.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interwar period ==
{{Main|Interwar period}}
The United States had been criticized for not taking up the hegemonic mantle following the disintegration of ''Pax Britannica'' before the First World War and during the interwar period due to the absence of established political structures, such as the [[World Bank]] or [[United Nations]] which would be created after World War II, and various internal policies, such as protectionism.&lt;ref name=&quot;HummelAnnal&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Harold. The Interwar Depression in an International Context. München: R. Oldenbourg, 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe0E1BEzOOEC&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Little, Michael Smith, ''Perspectives on World Politics''. Routledge, 2006.

Santa Barbara, Calif: ABC-CLIO, 2003. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3DE4P7NdaycC&amp;pg=PA135 Great Depression]'' pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Though, the United States participated in the Great War, according to Woodrow Wilson:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[...] to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth insure the observance of those principles.&lt;br /&gt;
[...] for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.&lt;ref name=&quot;HummelAnnal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:The Gap in the Bridge.png|thumbnail|left|The Gap in the Bridge. Cartoon about the absence of the U.S. from the League of Nations, depicted as the missing keystone of the arch.]]

The United States' entry into the Great War marked the abandonment of the traditional American policy of isolation and independence of world politics. Not at the close of the Civil War, not as the result of the Spanish War, but in the [[Interwar period]] did the United States become a part of the international system.&lt;ref name=&quot;HummelAnnal&quot; /&gt; With this global reorganization from the Great War, there were those in the American populace that advocated an activist role in international politics and international affairs by the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;HummelAnnal&quot; /&gt; Activities that were initiated did not fall into political-military traps and, instead, focused on economic-ideological approaches that would increase the American Empire and general worldwide stability.&lt;ref name=&quot;ParchamiHegemonic&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Parchami|first=Ali|title=Hegemonic Peace and Empire: The Pax Romana, Britannica and Americana|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQPEdl_cGHEC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=181|chapter=The Pax Americana Debate|isbn=9780203879290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the prior path, a precursor to the United Nations and a league to enforce peace, the League of Nations, was proposed by Woodrow Wilson.&lt;ref name=&quot;HummelAnnal&quot; /&gt; This was rejected by the American Government in favor of more economic-ideological approaches and the United States did not join the League. Additionally, there were even proposals of extending the Monroe Doctrine to Great Britain put forth to prevent a second conflagration on the European theater.&lt;ref name=&quot;EinsteinProphecy&quot; /&gt; Ultimately, the United States' proposals and actions did not stop the factors of  European nationalism spawned by the previous war, the repercussions of Germany's defeat, and the failures of the Treaty of Versailles from plunging the globe into a Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John (1998), The First World War, Hutchinson, {{ISBN|0-09-180178-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between World War I and World War II, America also sought to continue to preserve ''Pax America'' as a [[corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine.&lt;ref name=&quot;EinsteinProphecy&quot;&gt;Einstein, Lewis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gpUMAAAAYAAJ A Prophecy of the War (1913–1914)]. New York: Columbia University Press, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sought the peaceful and orderly evolution of existing conditions in the western hemisphere and nothing by immediate changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;EinsteinProphecy&quot; /&gt; Before 1917, the position of the United States government and the feelings of the nation in respect to the &quot;Great War&quot; initially had properly been one of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EinsteinProphecy&quot; /&gt; Its interests remained untouched, and nothing occurred of a nature to affect those interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;EinsteinProphecy&quot; /&gt;

The average American's sympathies, on the other hand, if the feelings of the vast majority of the nation had been correctly interpreted, was with the Allied (Entente) Powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;EinsteinProphecy&quot; /&gt; The population of the United States was revolted at the ruthlessness of the Prussian doctrine of war, and German designs to shift the burden of aggression encountered skeptical derision.&lt;ref name=&quot;EinsteinProphecy&quot; /&gt; The American populace saw themselves safeguarding liberal peace in the Western World. To this end, the American writer Roland Hugins stated:&lt;ref&gt;Roland Hugins, ''The Possible Peace'', New York, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The truth is that the United States is the only high-minded Power left in the world. It is the only strong nation that has not entered on a career of imperial conquest, and does not want to enter on it. [...] There is in America little of that spirit of selfish aggression which lies at the heart of militarism. Here alone exists a broad basis for &quot;a new passionate sense of brotherhood, and a new scale of human values.&quot; We have a deep abhorrence of war for war's sake; we are not enamored of glamour or glory. We have a strong faith in the principle of self-government. We do not care to dominate alien peoples, white or colored; we do not aspire to be the Romans of tomorrow or the &quot;masters of the world.&quot; The idealism of Americans centers in the future of America, wherein we hope to work out those principles of liberty and democracy to which we are committed. This political idealism, this strain of pacifism, this abstinence from aggression and desire to be left alone to work out our own destiny, has been manifest from the birth of the republic. We have not always followed our light, but we have never been utterly faithless to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;HummelAnnal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It was observed during this time that the initial defeat of Germany opened a moral recasting of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;EinsteinProphecy&quot; /&gt; The battles between Germans and Allies were seen as far less battles between different nations than they represent the contrast between [[Liberalism]] and [[reactionary|reaction]], between the aspirations of [[democracy]] and the [[Wilhelminism]] [[Blood and Iron (speech)|gospel of iron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EinsteinProphecy&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bismarck introduced this in the era of force.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern period ==
[[File:Superpower map 1945.png|240px|thumb|A world map of 1945 with three [[superpower]]s: the [[United States]] (in blue), the [[Soviet Union]] (in red), and the [[British Empire]] (in teal).]]

The modern ''Pax Americana'' era is cited by both supporters and critics of [[Foreign relations of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] after World War II. However, from 1946 to 1992 ''Pax Americana'' is considered a partial international order, as it applied only to capitalist bloc countries, being preferable for some authors to speak about a ''Pax Americana et Sovietica''.&lt;ref&gt;Ibañez Muñoz, Josep, &quot;El desafío a la Pax americana: del 11 de septiembre a la guerra de Irak&quot; in C. García and A. J. Rodrigo (eds) &quot;El imperio inviable. El orden internacional tras el conflicto de Irak&quot;, Madrid: Tecnos, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many commentators and critics focus on American policies from 1992 to the present, and as such, it carries different connotations depending on the context. For example, it appears three times in the 90 page document, ''[[Project for the New American Century#Rebuilding America's Defenses|Rebuilding America's Defenses]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |title=Rebuilding America's Defenses Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century |publisher=Newamericancentury.org |accessdate=2014-07-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923154604/http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |archive-date=September 23, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Project for the New American Century]], but is also used by critics to characterize American dominance and [[hyperpower]] as imperialist in function and basis. From about the mid-1940s until 1991, U.S. foreign policy was dominated by the [[Cold War]], and characterized by its significant international military presence and greater diplomatic involvement. Seeking an alternative to the isolationist policies pursued after World War I, the United States defined a new policy called [[containment]] to oppose the spread of [[communism]].

The modern ''Pax Americana'' may be seen as similar to the period of peace in [[Roman Empire|Rome]], ''[[Pax Romana]]''. In both situations, the period of peace was 'relative peace'.  During both ''Pax Romana'' and ''Pax Americana'' wars continued to occur, but it was still a prosperous time for both Western and Roman civilizations. It is important to note that during these periods, and most other times of relative tranquility, the peace that is referred to does not mean complete peace.  Rather, it simply means that the civilization prospered in their [[military]], [[agriculture]], [[trade]], and [[manufacturing]].

=== ''Pax Britannica'' heritage ===
{{Main|Pax Britannica}}

From the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 until [[World War I]] in 1914, the [[United Kingdom]] played the role of [[Offshore balancing|offshore-balancer]] in Europe, where the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was the main aim. It was also in this time that the British Empire became the largest empire of all time.  The global superiority of [[British Armed Forces|British military]] and commerce was guaranteed by dominance of a Europe lacking in strong [[nation-state]]s, and the presence of the [[Royal Navy]] on all of the world's oceans and seas. In 1905, the Royal Navy was superior to any two navies combined in the world. It provided services such as suppression of [[piracy]] and [[slavery]]. In this era of peace, though, there were several wars between the major powers: the [[Crimean War]], the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]], the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and the [[Russo-Japanese War]], as well as numerous other wars. ''[[La Belle Époque]]'', [[William Wohlforth]] argued, was rather ''Pax Britannica'', ''[[Pax Russica]]'' and later ''Pax Germanica'', and between 1853 and 1871 it was not ''Pax'' of any kind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unipolar World 1999 p 39&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=2539346|title=The Stability of a Unipolar World|last1=Wohlforth|first1=William C.|journal=International Security|year=1999|volume=24|issue=1|pages=5–41|doi=10.1162/016228899560031|s2cid=57568539}} p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the British hegemony, America developed close ties with Britain, evolving into what has become known as a &quot;[[special relationship]]&quot; between the two. The many commonalities shared with the two nations (such as language and history) drew them together as allies. Under the managed transition of the British Empire to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], members of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]], such as [[Harold Macmillan]], liked to think of [[Anglo-American relations|Britain's relationship with America]] as similar to that of a progenitor [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] to America's [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3581313/Labours-love-in-with-America-is-nothing-new.html  Labour's love-in with America is nothing new] [[Daily Telegraph]] 6 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years, both have been active in [[North America]]n, [[Middle East]]ern, and [[Asia]]n countries.

=== Late 20th century ===
{{Main|American Century}}
{{See also|History of the United States (1945–1964)|History of the United States (1964–1980)}}

After the Second World War, no [[war|armed conflict]] emerged among major Western nations themselves, and no [[nuclear weapon]]s were used in open conflict.  The [[United Nations]] was also soon developed after World War II to help keep peaceful relations between nations and establishing the veto power for the permanent members of the [[UN Security Council]], which included the United States.

In the second half of the 20th century, the [[USSR]] and US superpowers were engaged in the [[Cold War]], which can be seen as a struggle between hegemonies for global dominance. After 1945, the United States enjoyed an advantageous position with respect to the rest of the industrialized world. In the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]], the US was responsible for half of global industrial output, held 80 percent of the world's [[gold]] reserves, and was the world's sole [[list of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear power]]. The catastrophic destruction of life, infrastructure, and capital during the Second World War had exhausted the imperialism of the [[Old World]], victor and vanquished alike. The largest economy in the world at the time, the United States recognized that it had come out of the war with its domestic [[infrastructure]] virtually unscathed and its [[United States Armed Forces|military forces]] at unprecedented strength.

The term ''Pax Americana'' was explicitly used by [[John F. Kennedy]] in the 1960s, who advocated against the idea, arguing that the Soviet bloc was composed of human beings with the same individual goals as Americans and that such a peace based on &quot;American weapons of war&quot; was undesirable:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have, therefore, chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived. And that is the most important topic on earth: peace. What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a ''Pax Americana'' enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables men and nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for their children—not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael E.

Beginning around the [[Vietnam War]], the 'Pax Americana' term had started to be used by the critics of American Imperialism. Here in the late 20th century conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, the charge of ''[[Neocolonialism]]'' was often aimed at Western involvement in the affairs of the [[Third World]] and other developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511895449.009|chapter = Soviet new thinking on national liberation movements: Continuity and change|title = Soviet Foreign Policy in Transition|year = 1992|last1 = Chenoy|first1 = Anuradha M.|pages = 145–160|isbn = 9780521413657|editor1-last = Kanet|editor1-first = Roger E|editor2-last = Miner|editor2-first = Deborah N|editor3-last = Resler|editor3-first = Tamara J}} See especially pp. 149–50 of the internal definitions of neocolonialism in soviet bloc academia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Radford Ruether.

Currently, the ''Pax Americana'' is based on the military preponderance beyond challenge by any combination of powers and projection of power throughout the world's ''commons''—neutral sea, air and space. This projection is coordinated by the [[Unified Command Plan]] which divides the world on regional branches controlled by a single command. Integrated with it are global network of military alliances (the [[Rio Pact]], [[NATO]], [[ANZUS]] and bilateral alliances with Japan and several other states) coordinated by Washington in a hub-and-spokes system and worldwide network of several hundreds of military bases and installations. Neither the Rio Treaty, nor NATO, for [[Robert J. Art]], &quot;was a regional collective security organization; rather both were regional imperia run and operated by the United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=2539339|title=Geopolitics Updated: The Strategy of Selective Engagement|last1=Art|first1=Robert J.|journal=International Security|year=1998|volume=23|issue=3|pages=79–113|doi=10.2307/2539339}} p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Security Advisor Zbignew Brzezinski drew an expressive summary of the military foundation of ''Pax Americana'' shortly after the ''[[New world order (politics)|unipolar moment]]'':
{{quote|
In contrast [to the earlier empires], the scope and pervasiveness of American global power today are unique. Not only does the United States control all the world's oceans, its military legions are firmly perched on the western and eastern extremities of Eurasia&amp;nbsp;... American vassals and tributaries, some yearning to be embraced by even more formal ties to Washington, dot the entire Eurasian continent&amp;nbsp;... American global supremacy is&amp;nbsp;... buttered by an elaborate system of alliances and coalitions that literally span the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], ''[[The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives]]'', (Perseus Books, New York, 1997, p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Besides the military foundation, there are significant non-military international institutions backed by American financing and diplomacy (like the [[United Nations]] and [[WTO]]). The United States invested heavily in programs such as the [[Marshall Plan]] and in the reconstruction of [[Japan]], economically cementing defense ties that owed increasingly to the establishment of the [[Iron Curtain]]/[[Eastern Bloc]] and the widening of the [[Cold War]].

Being in the best position to take advantage of free trade, culturally indisposed to traditional empires, and alarmed by the rise of [[communism]] in [[China]] and the detonation of the first Soviet [[atom bomb]], the historically [[Noninterventionism|non-interventionist]] U.S. also took a keen interest in developing multilateral institutions which would maintain a favorable world order among them. The [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (World Bank), part of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of [[international financial system|international financial management]] was developed and, until the early 1970s, the existence of a [[fixed exchange rate]] to the US dollar. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was developed and consists of a protocol for normalization and reduction of trade [[tariff]]s.

With [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]], the demise of the notion of a ''[[Pax Sovietica]]'', and the end of the [[Cold War]], the U.S. maintained significant contingents of armed forces in Europe and [[East Asia]]. The institutions behind the Pax Americana and the rise of the United States unipolar power have persisted into the early 21st century. The ability of the United States to act as &quot;the world's [[police]]man&quot; has been constrained by its own citizens' historic aversion to foreign wars.&lt;ref&gt;Westerfield, H. Bradford. ''The Instruments of America's Foreign Policy''. New York: Crowell, 1963. p. 138. (''cf''. &quot;the traditional American aversion to foreign wars, but also related to some recent disillusionment with the fruits of total wars&amp;nbsp;...&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Though there has been calls for the continuation of military leadership, as stated in &quot;Rebuilding America's Defenses&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The American peace has proven itself peaceful, stable, and durable. It has, over the past decade, provided the geopolitical framework for widespread economic growth and the spread of American principles of liberty and democracy. Yet no moment in international politics can be frozen in time; even a global ''Pax Americana'' will not preserve itself. [... What is required is] a military that is strong and ready to meet both present and future challenges; a foreign policy that boldly and purposefully promotes American principles abroad; and national leadership that accepts the United States' global responsibilities.&lt;ref name=RAD2000&gt;{{Cite news

This is reflected in the research of American exceptionalism, which shows that &quot;there is some indication for [being a leader of an 'American peace'] among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of [[unilateral]] attitudes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de&quot; /&gt; Resentments have arisen at a country's dependence on American military protection, due to disagreements with United States foreign policy or the presence of American military forces.
In the ''[[post-communism]]'' world of the 21st-century, the French Socialist politician and former Foreign Minister [[Hubert Védrine]] describes the US as a hegemonic [[hyperpower]], while the U.S. political scientists [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Joseph Nye]] counter that the US is not a &quot;true&quot; hegemony, because it does not have the resources to impose a proper, formal, global rule; despite its political and military strength, the US is economically equal to Europe, thus, cannot rule the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye Sr., ''Understanding International Conflicts: An introduction to Theory and History'', pp. 276–77&lt;/ref&gt; Several other countries are either emerging or re-emerging as powers, such as [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Russia]], [[Republic of India|India]], and the [[European Union]].

Joseph Nye discredited the United States as not a &quot;true&quot; hegemony in his 2002 article titled &quot;The New Rome Meets the New Barbarians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=The new Rome meets the new barbarians |url=https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2002/03/21/the-new-rome-meets-the-new-barbarians |magazine=The Economist |issn=0013-0613|last=Nye|first= Joseph|date= March 21, 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190915234602/https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2002/03/21/the-new-rome-meets-the-new-barbarians|archive-date=2019-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book of the same year he opens: &quot;Not since Rome has one nation loomed so large above the others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Paradox of American Power'', (Oxford University Press, New York, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; And his 1991 book he titled ''Bound to Lead''.&lt;ref&gt;''Bound To Lead: The Changing Nature Of American Power'' (Basic Books, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leadership'', translated into Greek, renders ''[[hegemony]]''; an alternative translation is ''archia'' – Greek common word for ''empire''. Having defined the US hegemony as &quot;not true&quot;, Nye looks for an analogy to the true empire: Decline, he writes, is not necessarily imminent. &quot;Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the peak of its power&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2010-11-01/future-american-power The Future of American Power: Dominance and Decline in Perspective]&quot;, ''Foreign Affairs'' (November–December  2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, there are striking parallels with the early ''Pax Romana'' (especially between 189 BC when the supremacy over the Mediterranean was won and the first annexation in 168 BC). Under that ''Pax Romana'' other states remained formally independent and very seldom were called &quot;clients&quot;. The latter term became widely used only in the late medieval period. Usually, other states were called &quot;friends and allies&quot;—a popular expression under the ''Pax Americana''.

One of the first to use the term ''Pax Americana'' was the [[Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy]]. In 1942, the Committee envisaged that the United States may have to replace the British Empire. Therefore, the United States &quot;must cultivate a mental view toward world settlement after this war which will enable us to impose our own terms, amounting perhaps to a Pax Americana&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Michio Kaku and David Axelrod, ''To Win a Nuclear War: The Pentagon Secret War Plans'', Boston: South End Press, 1987, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swen Holdar, the founder of [[geopolitics]] [[Rudolf Kjellen]] (1864–1922) predicted the era of US global supremacy using the term ''Pax Americana'' shortly after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0962-6298(92)90031-N|title = The ideal state and the power of geography: The life-work of Rudolf Kjellén|year = 1992|last1 = Holdar|first1 = Sven|journal = Political Geography|volume = 11|issue = 3|pages = 307–323}} p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1945, [[Ludwig Dehio]] remembered that the Germans used the term ''Pax Anglosaxonica'' in a sense of Pax Americana since 1918:
{{quote|
Now [1918] the [American colonial] cutting had grown into a tree that bade fair to overshadow the globe with its foliage. Amazed and shaken, we Germans began to discuss the possibility of a Pax Anglosaxonica as a world-wide counterpart to the Pax Romana. Suddenly the tendency toward global unification towered up, ready to gather the separate national states of Europe together under one banner and blanket in a larger cohesion&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Dehio, ''The Precarious Balance: Four Centuries of the European Power Struggle'', 1945 (tr. Fullman, Charles, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1962), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The United States, Dehio associates on the same page, withdrew to isolation on that occasion. &quot;Rome, too, had taken a long time to understand the significance of her world role.&quot; Two years earlier, with the war still at its peak, the founder of the [[Paneuropean Union]], [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], invoked the example of the two-centuries long &quot;Pax Romana&quot; which, he suggested, could be repeated if based on the preponderant US air power:
{{quote|
During the third century BC the Mediterranean world was divided on five great powers—Roma and Carthage, Macedonia, Syria, and Egypt. The balance of power led to a series of wars until Rome emerged the queen of the Mediterranean and established an incomparable era of two centuries of peace and progress, the 'Pax Romana'&amp;nbsp;... It may be that America's air power could again assure our world, now much smaller than the Mediterranean at that period, two hundred years of peace&amp;nbsp;... This is the only realistic hope for a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;''Crusade for Pan-Europe'' (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1943), pp. 299–304.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
One of the first criticisms of &quot;Pax Americana&quot; was written by [[Nathaniel Peffer]] in 1943:
{{quote|
It is neither feasible nor desirable&amp;nbsp;... Pax Americana can be established and maintained only by force, only by means of a new, gigantic imperialism operating with the instrumentalities of militarism and the other concomitants of imperialism&amp;nbsp;... The way to dominion is through empire and the price of dominion is empire, and empire generates its own opposition.&lt;ref name=Peffer1943&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=2144425|title=America's Place in the Post-War World|last1=Peffer|first1=Nathaniel|journal=Political Science Quarterly|year=1943|volume=58|issue=1|pages=11–24|doi=10.2307/2144425}} pp. 12, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, Peffer was not certain that this would not happen: &quot;It is conceivable that&amp;nbsp;... America might drift into empire, imperceptibly, stage by stage, in a kind of power-politics gravitation.&quot; He also noted that America was heading precisely in that direction: &quot;That there are certain stirrings in this direction is apparent, though how deep they go is unclear.&quot;&lt;ref name=Peffer1943/&gt;

The depth soon became clarified. Two later critics of Pax Americana, [[Michio Kaku]] and [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], interpreted the outcome of Pax Americana: &quot;[[Gunboat diplomacy]] would be replaced by Atomic diplomacy. [[Pax Britannica]] would give way to Pax Americana.&quot; After the war, with the German and British militaries in tatters, only one force stood on the way to Pax Americana: the Red Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;To Win a Nuclear War, p 64&quot;&gt;''To Win a Nuclear War'', ''op. cit.'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years after this criticism was written, the Red Army withdrew, paving the way for the [[Unipolarity|unipolar moment]]. [[Joshua Muravchik]] commemorated the event by titling his 1991 article, &quot;At Last, Pax Americana&quot;. He detailed:
{{quote|
Last but not least, the Gulf War marks the dawning of the Pax Americana. True, that term was used immediately after World War II. But it was a misnomer then because the Soviet empire—a real competitor with American power—was born at the same moment. The result was not a &quot;pax&quot; of any kind, but a cold war and a bipolar world&amp;nbsp;... During the past two years, however, Soviet power has imploded and a bipolar world has become unipolar.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Muravchick, &quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/24/opinion/at-last-pax-americana.html At Last, Pax Americana]&quot;, ''The New York Times'' (January 24, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following year, in 1992, a US strategic draft for the post-Cold War period was leaked to the press. The person responsible for the confusion, former Assistant Secretary of State, [[Paul Wolfowitz]], confessed seven years later: &quot;In 1992 a draft memo prepared by my office at the Pentagon&amp;nbsp;... leaked to the press and sparked a major controversy.&quot; The draft's strategy aimed &quot;to prevent any hostile power from dominating&quot; a Eurasian region &quot;whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power&quot;. He added: &quot;Senator Joseph Biden ridiculed the proposed strategy as 'literally a ''Pax Americana''&amp;nbsp;... It won't work&amp;nbsp;...' Just seven years later, many of these same critics seem quite comfortable with the idea of a ''Pax Americana''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://nationalinterest.org/article/remembering-the-future-855|jstor = 42897259|title = Remembering the Future|last1 = Wolfowitz|first1 = Paul|journal = The National Interest|year = 2000|issue = 59|pages = 35–45}} p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War period, concluded [[William Wohlforth]], much less ambiguously deserves to be called ''Pax Americana''. &quot;Calling the current period the true Pax Americana may offend some, but it reflects reality&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unipolar World 1999 p 39&quot; /&gt;

The ‘’Pax Americana’’ motif reached its peak in the context of the 2003 [[Iraq War]]. The phrase &quot;American Empire&quot; appeared in one thousand news stories over a single six-month period in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Go, ''Patterns of Empire: The British and American Empires, 1688 to the Present'' (New York: Cambridge University Press,  2011), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Freedland]] observed:

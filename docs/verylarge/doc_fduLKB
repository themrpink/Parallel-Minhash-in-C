Jerry Cantrell's guitar style combines &quot;pummeling riffs and expansive guitar textures&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dirt - Guitar World&quot; /&gt; to create &quot;slow, brooding minor-key grinds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/degradation-trip-r590407/review |title=Degradation Trip |author =Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also recognized for his natural ability to blend acoustic and electric guitars. While down-tuned, distorted guitars mixed with Staley's distinctive &quot;snarl-to-a-scream&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dirt - Guitar World&quot;/&gt; vocals appealed to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans, the band also had &quot;a sense of melody that was undeniable,&quot; which introduced Alice in Chains to a much wider audience outside of the heavy metal underground.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Facelift&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]], Alice in Chains' sound has a &quot;[[Black Sabbath]]-style riffing and an unconventional vocal style.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;/&gt; The band has been described by Erlewine as &quot;hard enough for metal fans, yet their dark subject matter and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the Seattle-based grunge bands.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;/&gt; Three of the band's releases feature acoustic music, and while the band initially kept these releases separate, Alice in Chains' self-titled album combined the styles to form &quot;a bleak, nihilistic sound that balanced grinding hard rock with subtly textured acoustic numbers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;/&gt;

Alice in Chains is also noted for the unique vocal harmonies of Staley (or DuVall) and Cantrell, which included overlapping passages, dual lead vocals, and trademark harmonies typically separated by a major third.&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;/&gt; Cantrell said it was Staley who gave him the self-assurance to sing his own songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guitar World 2013&quot;/&gt; Alyssa Burrows said the band's distinctive sound &quot;came from Staley's vocal style and his lyrics dealing with personal struggles and addiction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Burrows, Alyssa |date=May 17, 2002 |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=3778 |title=Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley dies on April 5, 2002. |publisher=Historylink.com |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staley's songs were often considered &quot;dark,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;/&gt; with themes such as drug abuse, depression, and suicide,&lt;ref name=&quot;Remembering Layne Staley&quot;/&gt; while Cantrell's lyrics often dealt with personal relationships.

The brother of [[Mehmed V]], he became heir to the throne in 1916 after the suicide of [[Abdülaziz]]'s son, [[Şehzade Yusuf Izzeddin]], as the eldest male member of the [[House of Osman]]. He acceded to the throne after the death of Mehmed V.&lt;ref&gt;Freely, John, ''Inside the Seraglio'', 1999, Chapter 16: The Year of Three Sultans.&lt;/ref&gt; He was girded with the [[Sword of Osman]] on 4 July 1918, as the thirty-sixth ''[[padishah]]''. His father was Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]] and his mother was [[Gülüstü Hanım]] (1830 – 1865.) She was an ethnic [[Abkhaz people|Abkhazian]], daughter of Prince Tahir Bey Çaçba and his wife Afişe Lakerba, who was originally named Fatma Çaçba.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harun&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Harun Açba|title=Kadın efendiler: 1839-1924|url=https://books.google.com/books?gA0nNAAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Profil|isbn=978-9-759-96109-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmed stepped down when the [[Abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate|Ottoman Sultanate was abolished]] in 1922, and the secular Republic of Turkey was created, with [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] as the first president.

==Early life==
Mehmed VI was born at the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], in [[Constantinople]], on 14 January 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica|volume=7|editor-first=Hugh|editor-last=Chisholm|year=1911|number=3|quote=Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul]:''When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capital was moved to Ankara, and Constantinople was officially renamed Istanbul in 1930.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Mehmed's father died when Mehmed was only five months old, and Mehmed's mother died when he was four years old. He was raised and taught by his step-mother [[Şayeste Hanım]]. He trained himself by taking lessons from private teachers and attending some of the lessons given at Fatih Madrasa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehmed&quot;/&gt; The prince had a rough time with his overbearing stepmother, and at the age of 16 he left his stepmother's mansion with the three servants who had been serving him since childhood.{{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=6}}

He grew up with nannies, female servants, and tutors. During the thirty-three years of his brother Sultan Abdülhamid’s reign he lived in the [[Ottoman Imperial Harem]]. {{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=4-5}}
 
During his youth his closest friend was [[Abdulmejid II]],  the son of his uncle, Sultan Abdülaziz. But, sadly, in the years to come, the two cousins became unyielding rivals. Before moving to the [[Feriye Palace]], the prince had lived briefly in the mansion in Çengelköy owned by [[Şehzade Ahmed Kemaleddin]]. {{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=7}}

During the reign of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], Mehmed was considered to be the sultan’s closest brother. In the years to come, when he ascended to the throne, this closeness would greatly influence his political attitudes, such as his intense dislike of the Young Turks and the [[Committee of Union and Progress|Union and Progress Party]], and his sympathy for the British. {{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=8}}

===Education===
Mehmed took private lessons, he read a great deal, and he was interested in various subjects, including the arts, which was a tradition of the Ottoman family. He took courses in calligraphy and music and learned how to write in the naskh script and to play the kanun (a kind of zither).{{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=6}}

Then he became interested in [[Sufism]] and, unknown to the Palace, he followed courses at the madrasa of Fatih on Islamic jurisprudence, Islamic theology, interpretation of the [[Quran]], and the Hadiths, as well as in Arabic and Persian. He attended the dervish lodge of Ahmed Ziyaüddin Gümüşhanevi, located not far from the Sublime Porte, where Ömer Ziyaüddin of Dagestan was the spiritual leader, and he became a disciple of the [[Naqshbandi]] order. {{sfn|Bardakçı|2017|p=6-7}}

==Reign==
Mehmed succeeded to the throne after the death of his half-brother [[Mehmed V]], on 3 July 1918. {{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2015|p=488}}

The [[World War I|First World War]] was a disaster for the Ottoman Empire. British and allied forces conquered [[Baghdad]], [[Damascus]], and [[Jerusalem]] during the war, and most of the Ottoman Empire was divided amongst the European allies. At the [[San Remo conference]] of April 1920, the [[France|French]] were granted a mandate over [[Syria]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] were granted one over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. On 10 August 1920, Mehmed's representatives signed the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], which recognised the mandates and recognised [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] as an independent state.

The sultan requested the resignation of the Unionist government and assigned [[Ahmet Tevfik Pasha|Ahmed Tevfik Pasha]] to form the government.  In the speech of the opening of the new legislative year of the parliament, [[Woodrow Wilson]] said that he applied for peace according to his principles, that he wanted peace in accordance with the honour and dignity of the state, that he believed that the precious places of the homeland were not occupied, and that the army would begin heroically{{clarify|date=May 2020}}.  Mustafa Kemal Pasha, who sent a telegram to the Sultan, asked the government to establish Ahmed Izzet Pasha and make him a [[Ministry of War (Ottoman Empire)|minister of Harbiye]].The sultan assigned the task of forming the government to his son Ahmed Izzet Pasha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehmed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=MEHMED VI محمد (1861-1926) Son Osmanlı padişahı (1918-1922).|url=https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/mehmed-vi |website=İslam Ansiklopedisi|access-date=19 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new government, consisting of members of the [[Freedom and Accord Party|Liberty and Accord Party]], arrested the leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress, including one of the former grand viziers, [[Said Halim Pasha]]. The trial of [[Boğazlıyan]] District Governor Kemal Bey was quickly concluded, and the death penalty was carried out in Beyazıt Square after the fatwa was signed by the sultan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehmed&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, the French General d'Esperey, who came to Istanbul, threatened to go to the palace with a battalion of soldiers and make what he wanted by burning the distractions of the sultan and his government. He called him to the embassy without visiting the Grand Vizier. The French handed over a list of thirty-six people they wanted to arrest to the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehmed&quot;/&gt;

Turkish nationalists rejected the settlement by the Sultan's four signatories. A new government, the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]], under the leadership of [[Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk)]], was formed on 23 April 1920, in [[Ankara]] (then known as Angora). The new government denounced the rule of Mehmed VI and the command of [[Süleyman Şefik Pasha]], who was in charge of the army commissioned to fight against the [[Turkish National Movement]] (the [[Kuva-yi Inzibatiye|Kuvâ-i İnzibâtiyye]]); as a result, a [[Turkish Constitution of 1921|temporary constitution was drafted]].

On 22 July 1920, Şurayı Saltanat{{who|date=May 2020}} was gathered in Yıldız Palace to discuss the principles of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. The Sevres Agreement was signed on 10 August 1920.  Since he had to resign two and a half-month later, Ferid Pasha founded the last delegation of Tevfik Pasha, the last delegation of the Ottoman Empire, on 2 October 1920.{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2015|p=494}}

==Exile and death==
[[File:Former Ottoman Sultan Mehmed VI arrives in Malta on a British warship. 9 Dec 1922.jpg|thumb|Mehmed VI arrives in Malta on a British warship, 9 Dec 1922. On the left, 10-year-old Prince Mehmed Ertuğrul Efendi]]
The Grand National Assembly of Turkey abolished the [[Sultanate]] on 1 November 1922, and Mehmed VI was expelled from [[Istanbul]]. One day before his departure, he had lunch with his daughter, [[Ulviye Sultan]], and spent a night at her palace.{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2015|p=497}} Leaving aboard the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[warship]] [[HMS Malaya|''Malaya'']] on 17 November 1922, he took care not to bring valuable items or jewelry, other than his personal belongings. Harington himself took the last Ottoman ruler from [[Yıldız Palace]]. Ten people with the sultan were sent off early in the morning by an English battalion. He went into exile in [[Malta]], later living on the [[Italian Riviera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehmed&quot;/&gt;

On 19 November 1922, Mehmed's first cousin and heir, Abdulmejid Efendi, was elected [[caliph]], becoming the new head of the Imperial House of Osman as [[Abdulmejid II]] before [[Abolition of the Caliphate|the Caliphate was abolished]] by the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 1924.

Mehmed sent a declaration to the Caliphate Congress and protested the preparations made, declaring that he had never waived the right to reign and be caliph. The congress met on 13 May 1926, but Mehmed died without the news of the congress meeting on 16 May 1926 in [[Sanremo]], [[Italy]]. His daughter Sabiha Sultan found money for a burial, and the coffin was taken to Syria and buried at the [[Tekkiye Mosque]] of Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;Freely, John, ''Inside the Seraglio'', published 1999, Chapter 19: The Gathering Place of the Jinns&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehmed&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2015|p=498}}

==Character==
Mehmed Vahdeddin had an optimistic and patient personality according to the testimony of his relatives and employees. He was evidently a kind family man in his palace; outside, and especially at official ceremonies, he would stand cold, frowning and serious, and would not compliment anyone; he attached great importance to religious traditions; the palace didn't know the gossip and didn't like it being spoken alongside.  Even in his informal conversations, he always attracted attention with seriousness.  The sources in question also state that he was intelligent and quick-grasped, but he was under the influence of his entourage and especially those he believed in, that he had a very evident, unstable and stubborn temperament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehmed&quot;/&gt;

Mehmed VI had dealt with advanced literature, music, and calligraphy.  His compositions were performed in the palace when he was on the throne.  The lyrics of the songs he repeatedly composed while in Tâif envision the longing of the country and the pain of not getting the news that they have left behind.  Sixty-three works belonging to him can be identified, but only forty works have notes.  His poems, which can be an example to his poetry, are only the lyrics of his songs. He was also a good calligrapher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehmed&quot;/&gt;

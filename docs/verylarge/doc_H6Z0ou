[[Simon Keynes]] points out that all coins were issued in Edward's name, and while the Mercian rulers were able to issue some charters on their own authority, others acknowledged Edward's lordship. In 903 a Mercian ealdorman &quot;petitioned King Edward, and also Æthelred and Æthelflæd, who then held rulership and power over the race of the Mercians under the aforesaid king&quot;. Keynes argues that a new polity was created when Æthelred submitted to Alfred in the 880s, covering Wessex and English (western) Mercia. In Keynes's view, &quot;the conclusion seems inescapable that the Alfredian polity of the kingship 'of the Anglo-Saxons' persisted in the first quarter of the tenth century, and that the Mercians were thus under Edward's rule from the beginning of his reign&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes|1y=1998|1pp=37–38|2a1=Keynes|2y=1999|2pp=459–464}} Ryan believes that the Mercian rulers &quot;had a considerable but ultimately subordinate share of royal authority&quot;.{{sfn|Ryan|2013|p=298}}

In Higham's view, Keynes makes a strong case that Edward ruled over an Anglo-Saxon state with a developing administrative and ideological unity but that Æthelflæd and Æthelred did much to encourage a separate Mercian identity, such as establishing cults of Mercian saints at their new burhs, as well as reverence for their great Northumbrian royal saint at Gloucester:

{{quote|There must remain some doubt as to the extent to which Edward's intentions for the future were shared in all respects by his sister and brother-in-law, and one is left to wonder what might have occurred had their sole offspring been male rather than female. Celtic visions of Æthelred and Æthelflæd as king and queen certainly offer a different, and equally valid, contemporary take on the complex politics of this transition to a new English state.{{sfn|Higham|2001b|pp=307–308}} }}

==Commemoration==
In June 2018, Æthelflæd's funeral was re-enacted in front of a crowd of 10,000 people in Gloucester, as part of a series of living history events marking the 1,100th anniversary of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-44429911|work=[[BBC News]]|title=Gloucester funeral procession honours Aethelflaed, Lady of the Mercians|date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Autograph score of part of Act2 (Wolf's Glen) of 'Der Freischütz' - NGO4p1116.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A hand-written [[Sheet music|musical score]] for Act 2 of the [[opera]] ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber]], written in the 1820s. The score contains all the parts for the singers and the [[accompaniment]] parts and melodies for the [[orchestra]].]]
'''Orchestration''' is the study or practice of writing [[music]] for an [[orchestra]] (or, more loosely, for any [[musical ensemble]], such as a [[concert band]]) or of adapting music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Also called &quot;instrumentation&quot;, orchestration is the assignment of different instruments to play the different parts (e.g., [[melody]], [[bassline]], etc.) of a musical work.  For example, a work for solo piano could be adapted and orchestrated so that an orchestra could perform the piece, or a concert band piece could be orchestrated for a symphony orchestra.

In [[classical music]], composers have historically orchestrated their own music.  Only gradually over the course of music history did orchestration come to be regarded as a separate compositional art and profession in itself. In modern classical music, composers almost invariably orchestrate their own work.

However, in [[musical theatre]], [[film music]] and other commercial media, it is customary to use orchestrators and arrangers to one degree or another, since time constraints and/or the level of training of composers may preclude them orchestrating the music themselves.

The precise role of the orchestrator in film music is highly variable, and depends greatly on the needs and skill set of the particular composer. 

In musical theatre, the composer typically writes a piano/vocal score and then hires an [[arranger]] or orchestrator to create the instrumental score for the [[pit orchestra]] to play.

In jazz [[big band]]s, the composer or [[songwriter]] writes the [[lead sheet]], which contains the melody and the chords, and then one or more orchestrators or arrangers &quot;flesh out&quot; these basic musical ideas by creating parts for the saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and the [[rhythm section]] (bass, piano/[[jazz guitar]]/[[Hammond organ]], drums). 

==As profession==
An '''orchestrator''' is a trained musical professional who assigns instruments to an [[orchestra]] or other [[musical ensemble]] from a piece of music written by a [[composer]], or who adapts music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Orchestrators may work for [[musical theatre]] productions, [[film production]] companies or [[recording studio]]s. Some orchestrators teach at colleges, conservatories or universities. The training done by orchestrators varies. Most have completed formal postsecondary education in music, such as a [[Bachelor of Music]] (B.Mus.), [[Master of Music]] (M.Mus.) or an artist's diploma. Orchestrators who teach at universities, colleges and conservatories may be required to hold a master's degree or a Doctorate (the latter may be a Ph.D. or a D.M.A). Orchestrators who work for film companies, musical theatre companies and other organizations may be hired solely based on their orchestration experience, even if they do not hold academic credentials. In the 2010s, as the percentage of faculty holding [[terminal degree]]s and/or Doctoral degrees is part of how an institution is rated, this is causing an increasing number of postsecondary institutions to require terminal and/or Doctoral degrees.

==In practice==
The term ''orchestration'' in its specific sense refers to the way instruments are used to portray any musical aspect such as [[melody]], [[harmony]] or [[rhythm]]. For example, a C [[major chord]] is made up of the notes [[C (musical note)|C]], [[E (musical note)|E]], and [[G (musical note)|G]]. If the notes are held out the entire duration of a [[bar (music)|measure]], the composer or orchestrator will have to decide what instrument(s) play this chord and in what [[Register (music)|register]]. Some instruments, including [[woodwinds]] and [[brass]] are [[Monophony|monophonic]] and can only play one note of the chord at a time. However, in a full orchestra there are more than one of these instruments, so the composer may choose to outline the chord in its basic form with a group of [[clarinets]] or [[trumpets]] (with separate instruments each being given one of the three notes of the chord). Other instruments, including the [[string instrument|strings]], [[piano]], [[harp]], and pitched [[percussion]] are [[polyphonic]] and may play more than one note at a time. As such, if the composer/orchestrator wishes to have the strings play the C major chord, he could assign the low C to the cellos and basses, the G to the violas, and then a high E to the second [[violin]]s and an E an octave higher to the first violins. If the composer/orchestrator wishes the chord to be played only by the first and second violins, he could give the second violins a low C and give the first violins a [[double stop]] of the notes G (an open string) and E.

Additionally in orchestration, notes may be placed into another register (such as transposed down for the [[string bass|basses]]), doubled (both in the same and different octaves), and altered with various levels of dynamics.  The choice of instruments, registers, and dynamics affect the overall [[timbre|tone color]].  If the C major chord was orchestrated for the [[trumpet]]s and [[trombone]]s playing [[fortissimo]] in their upper registers, it would sound very bright; but if the same chord was orchestrated for the [[cello|celli]] and [[string bass]]es playing [[sul tasto]], doubled by the [[bassoon]]s and [[bass clarinet]], it might sound heavy and dark.

Note that although the above example discussed orchestrating a chord, a melody or even a single note may be orchestrated in this fashion. Also note that in this specific sense of the word, ''orchestration'' is not necessarily limited to an orchestra, as a composer may ''orchestrate'' this same C major chord for, say, a [[woodwind quintet]], a [[string quartet]] or a [[concert band]]. Each different ensemble would enable the orchestrator/composer to create different tone &quot;colours&quot; and timbres.

A [[melody]] is also orchestrated. The composer or orchestrator may think of a melody in their head, or while playing the piano or organ. Once they have thought of a melody, they have to decide which instrument (or instruments) will play the melody. One widely used approach for a melody is to assign it to the first violins. When the first violins play a melody, the composer can have the second violins double the melody an octave below, or have the second violins play a harmony part (often in thirds and sixths). Sometimes, for a forceful effect, a composer will indicate in the score that all of the strings (violins, violas, cellos, and double basses) will play the melody in [[unison]], at the same time. Typically, even though the instruments are playing the same note names, the violins will play very high-register notes, the violas and cellos will play lower-register notes, and the double basses will play the deepest, lowest pitches.

As well, the [[woodwinds]] and [[brass instrument]]s can effectively carry a melody, depending on the effect the composer/orchestrator desires. The [[trumpet]]s can perform a melody in a powerful, high register. Alternatively, if the trombones play a melody, the pitch will be lower than the trumpet, and the tone will be heavier, which may change the musical effect that is created. While the [[cello]]s are often given an [[accompaniment]] role in orchestration, there are notable cases where the cellos have been assigned the melody. In even more rare cases, the double bass section (or principal bass) may be given a melody (e.g., the high-register double bass solo in [[Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Lieutenant Kije Suite]]'').

While assigning a melody to a particular section, such as the string section or the woodwinds will work well, as the stringed instruments and all the woodwinds blend together well, some composers give the melody to one section and then have the melody doubled by a different section or an instrument from a different section. For example, a melody played by the first violins could be doubled by the [[glockenspiel]], which would add a sparkling, chime-like colour to the melody. Alternatively, a melody played by the piccolos could be doubled by the [[celesta]], which would add a bright tone to the sound.

In the 20th and 21st century, [[contemporary composer]]s began to incorporate [[music technology (electric)|electric]] and [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic]] instruments into the orchestra, such as the [[electric guitar]] played through a [[guitar amplifier]], the [[electric bass]] played through a [[bass amplifier]], the [[Theremin]] and the [[synthesizer]]. The addition of these new instruments gave composers new options for creating tonal &quot;colours&quot; in their orchestration. For example, in the late 20th century and onwards, a composer could have a melody played by the first violins doubled by a futuristic-sounding [[synthesizer]] or a [[theremin]] to create an unusual effect.

Orchestral instrumentation is denoted by an abbreviated formulaic convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orchestral Music a Handbook|last=Daniels|first=David|publisher=Scarecrow Press Inc.|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[bassoon]], [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], [[tuba]]. More details can be contained in brackets. A dot separates one player from another, a slash indicates doubling. Timpani and percussion are denoted 2Tmp+ number of percussion.

For example, 3[1.2.3/pic] 2[1.Eh] 3[1.2.3/Ebcl/bcl] 3[1.2/cbn.cbn] tmp+2 is interpreted as:

* 3 flautists, the 3rd doubling on piccolo (&quot;doubling&quot; means that the performer can play flute and piccolo)
* 
* 2 oboists, the 2nd playing English horn throughout
* 
* 3 clarinetists, the 3rd doubling also on E-flat clarinet and bass clarinet
* 
* 3 bassoonists, the 2nd doubling on contrabassoon, the 3rd playing only contra
* 
* Timpani+ 2 percussion.

As an example, Mahler Symphony 2 is scored: 4[1/pic.2/pic.3/pic.4/pic] 4[1.2.3/Eh.4/Eh] 5[1.2.3/bcl.4/Ebcl2.Ebcl] 4[1.2.3.4/cbn]- 10 8 4 1- 2tmp+4-2&amp;nbsp;hp- org- str.

==Examples from the repertoire==

===J.S Bach===
During the [[Baroque]] era, composers showed increasing awareness of the expressive potential of orchestration.  While some early Baroque pieces have no indication of which instruments should play the piece, the choice of instruments being left to the musical group's leader or [[concertmaster]], there are Baroque works which specify certain instruments. The orchestral accompaniment to the aria 'et misericordia' from J.S.Bach’s ''[[Magnificat]]'', BWV243 (1723) features muted strings [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubled]] by flutes, a subtle combination of mellow instrumental [[timbres]].[[File:Et misericordia.png|thumb|center|500px|Orchestral introduction to 'et misericordia' from Bach's Magnificat, BWV 243. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om6FA-8Rs5I Listen]]]

The orchestral introduction to the opening chorus of J.S.Bach’s [[epiphany (holiday)|epiphany]] Cantata [[Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen, BWV 65|''Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen'']] BWV65, which [[John Eliot Gardiner]] (2013, p.&amp;nbsp;328) describes as “one of the crowning glories of Bach’s first Christmas season” demonstrates the composer’s mastery of his craft.  Within a space of eight bars, we hear recorders, [[oboe da caccia|oboes da caccia]], horns and strings creating a “glittery sheen” of contrasted timbres, sonorities and textures ranging from just two horns against a string [[pedal point]] in the first bar to a “restatement of the octave unison theme, this time by all the voices and instruments spread over five octaves” in bars 7-8:&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, J.E. (2013, p. 328) ''Music in the Castle of Heaven''.  London, Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65.wav|thumb|Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65.]][[File:Sie werden aus Saba Alle kommen opening bars.png|thumb|center|600px|Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65. ]]

Igor Stravinsky (1959, p45) marvelled at Bach’s skill as an orchestrator: “What incomparable instrumental writing is Bach's. You can smell the resin [(rosin)] in his violin parts, [and] taste the reeds in the 
oboes.”&lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky I. and Craft, R. ''Conversations with Igor Stravinsky''.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rameau===
Jean Philippe [[Rameau]] was famous for &quot;the eloquence of [his] orchestral writing which was something entirely new... - with a feeling for colour [(i.e., tone colour or [[timbre]])] that is altogether 'modern'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pincherle, M. (1967, p.122) ''An Illustrated History of Music''.  London, MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In 'The Entrance of Polymnie' from his opera ''[[Les Boréades]]'' (1763), the predominant string texture is shot through with descending scale figures on the bassoon, creating an exquisite blend of timbres:[[File:Entry of Polymnie from les Boreades.wav|thumb|'L'Entrée de Polymnie' from ''Les Boréades'' by Rameau.]][[File:Entry of Polymnie from les Boreades.png|thumb|center|500px|'L'Entrée de Polymnie' from ''Les Boréades'' by Rameau.]]In the aria ‘Rossignols amoureux’ from his opera ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'', Rameau evokes the sound of lovelorn nightingales by means of two flutes blending with a solo violin, while the rest of the violins play sustained notes in the background.

===Haydn===
Joseph [[Haydn]] was a pioneer of symphonic form, but he was also a pioneer of orchestration.  In the minuet of [[Symphony No. 97 (Haydn) |Symphony No. 97]], “we can see why [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] declared Haydn to be the greatest of all masters of orchestration. The oom-pah-pah of a German dance band is rendered with the utmost refinement, amazingly by kettledrums and trumpets pianissimo, and the rustic ''[[glissando]]''… is given a finicky elegance by the grace notes in the horns as well as by the doubling of the melody an octave higher with the solo violin.  These details are not intended to blend, but to be set in relief; they are individually exquisite.”&lt;ref&gt; Rosen, C. (1971, p342-3) The Classical Style. London, Faber. &lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Haydn, Symphony 97, third movement, bars 109-116.wav|thumb|Haydn, Symphony 97, third movement, bars 109-118]][[File:Haydn, Symphony 97, third movement, bars 109-117.png|thumb|center|500px|]][[File:Haydn, Symphony 97, third movement, bars 109-118.png|thumb|center|500px|Haydn, Symphony 97, third movement, bars 109-118]] Another example of Haydn’s imagination and ingenuity that shows how well he understood how orchestration can support harmony may be found in the concluding bars of the second movement his [[Symphony No. 94 (Haydn) |Symphony No. 94]] (the “Surprise Symphony.”)  Here, the oboes and bassoons take over the theme, while sustained chords in the strings accompany it with “soft, but very dissonant harmony. “&lt;ref&gt; Taruskin, R. (2010, p573) The Oxford History of Western Music: Music in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries.  Oxford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; Flute, Horns and timpani add to the mix, all contributing to the “air of uncanny poignancy” that characterises this atmospheric conclusion.&lt;ref&gt; Taruskin, R. (2010, p573) The Oxford History of Western Music: Music in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries.  Oxford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Haydn, Symphony 94, second movement bars 150-156.wav|thumb|Haydn, Symphony 94, second movement bars 143-156]][[File:Haydn, Symphony 94, second movement bars 150-157.png|thumb|center|500px|]][[File:Haydn, Symphony 94, second movement bars 150-158.png|thumb|center|500px|Haydn, Symphony 94, second movement bars 143-156]]

===Mozart===
[[Mozart]] &quot;was acutely sensitive to matters of instrumentation and instrumental effect where orchestral writing was concerned&quot;, including a &quot;meticulous attitude towards the spacing of chords.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Keefe, S.P. (2003, p.92) ''The Cambridge Companion to Mozart''. Cambridge University Press.  &lt;/ref&gt; [[H. C. Robbins Landon]] marvels at the “gorgeous wash of colour displayed in Mozart’s scores.”&lt;ref&gt; Robbins Landon, H. (1989, p.137), Mozart, the Golden Years.  London, Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;   For example, the opening movement of the [[Symphony No. 39 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 39]] (K543) contains “a charming dialogue between strings and woodwind”&lt;ref&gt; Robbins Landon, H. and Mitchell, D. (1956, p. 191) The Mozart Companion.  London, Faber. &lt;/ref&gt; that demonstrates the composer’s exquisite aural imagination for the blending and contrast of [[timbres]].  Bars 102-3 feature a widely spaced [[voicing (music)|voicing]] over a range of four octaves.  The first and second violins weave curly parallel melodic lines, a tenth apart, underpinned by a [[pedal point]] in the double basses and a sustained [[octave]] in the horns.  Wind instruments respond in bars 104-5, accompanied by a spidery ascending [[chromatic]] line in the cellos.[[File:Symphony 39, first movement, bars 102-119.wav|thumb|Symphony 39, first movement, bars 102-119]] [[File:Symphony 39, first movement, bars 102-120.png|thumb|center|500px|Symphony 39, first movement, bars 102-105]]A graceful continuation to this features clarinets and bassoons with the lower strings supplying the bass notes.[[File:Symphony 39, first movement, bars 102-121.png|thumb|center|500px|Symphony 39, first movement, bars 106-109]]Next, a phrase for strings alone blends [[pizzicato]] cellos and basses with bowed violins and violas, playing mostly in thirds:[[File:Symphony 39, first movement, bars 110-114.png|thumb|center|500px|Symphony 39, first movement, bars 110-114]]The woodwind repeat these four bars with the violins adding a [[counter-melody]] against the cellos and basses playing [[Bow (music)|''arco'']].  The violas add crucial harmonic colouring here with their D flat in bar 115. In 1792, an early listener marvelled at the dazzling orchestration of this movement “ineffably grand and rich in ideas, with striking variety in almost all obbligato parts.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Black|first1=David|title=A personal response to the Mozart memorial concert in Hamburg and the Symphony in E-flat (K. 543)|url=https://sites.google.com/site/mozartdocuments/documents/1792-02-19-anderwitsch|website=Mozart: New Documents, edited by Dexter Edge and David Black|accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Symphony 39, first movement, bars 115-119.png|thumb|center|500px|Symphony 39, first movement, bars 115-119]]“The main feature in [his] orchestration is Mozart’s density, which is of course part of his density of thought.”&lt;ref&gt; Robbins Landon, H. (1989, p.137), Mozart, the Golden Years.  London, Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important technique of Mozart's orchestration was [[call and response (music)|antiphony]], the &quot;call and response&quot; exchange of musical motifs or &quot;ideas&quot; between different groups in the orchestra. In an antiphonal section, the composer may have one group of instruments introduce a melodic idea (e.g., the first violins), and then have the woodwinds &quot;answer&quot; by restating this melodic idea, often with some type of variation. In the trio section of the minuet from his [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 41]] (1788), the flute, bassoons and horn exchange phrases with the strings, with the first violin line [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubled]] at the [[octave]] by the first oboe:[[File:Mozart Jupiter Symphony Trio.wav|thumb|Trio section of the Minuet from Mozart's Symphony No. 41.]] [[File:Mozart Jupiter Trio.png|thumb|center|500px|Trio section of the Minuet from Mozart's Symphony No. 41. ]] Charles Rosen (1971, p.&amp;nbsp;240) admires Mozart’s skill in orchestrating his piano concertos, particularly the [[Piano Concerto No. 22 (Mozart)|Concerto in E flat major, K482]], a work that introduced clarinets into the mix.  “This concerto places the greatest musical reliance on tone colour, which is, indeed, almost always ravishing.  One lovely example of its sonorities comes near the beginning.”&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (1971, p240) The Classical Style.  London Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mozart Piano Concerto 22 first movement opening.wav|thumb|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 1-12]][[File:Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 1-6.png|thumb|center|500px|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 1-6]] 
 
The orchestral [[tutti]] in the first two bars is answered by just horns and bassoon in bars 2-6.  This passage repeats with fresh orchestration: [[File:Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 7-12.png|thumb|center|500px|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 7-12. ]]“Here we have the unusual sound on the violins providing the bass for the solo clarinets.  The simplicity of the sequence concentrates all our interest on tone-colour, and what follows – a series of woodwind solos – keeps it there.  The orchestration throughout, in fact, has a greater variety than Mozart had wished or needed before, and fits the brilliance, charm, and grace of the first movement and the finale.”&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (1971, p240) The Classical Style.  London Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beethoven===
Beethoven’s innovative mastery of orchestration and his awareness of the effect of highlighting, contrasting and blending distinct instrumental [[timbre|colours]] are well exemplified in the [[Scherzo]] of his [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven) |Symphony No. 2]]. [[George Grove]] asks us to note “the sudden contrasts both in amount and quality of sound… we have first the full orchestra, then a single violin, then two horns, then two violins, then the full orchestra again, all within the space of half-a-dozen bars.”&lt;ref&gt; Grove, G. (1896, p.34) ''Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies''.  London, Novello. &lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The scoring, a bar of this followed by a bar of that, is virtually unique, and one can visualize chaos reigning at the first rehearsal when many a player must have been caught unprepared.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A. (1981, p.51)  ''The Nine Symphonies of Beethoven''. London, Heinemann. &lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Symphony 2 scherzo bars 1-8.wav|thumb|Beethoven, Symphony 2 scherzo bars 1-8]][[File:Symphony 2 scherzo bars 1-9.png|thumb|center|500px|Symphony 2 scherzo bars 1-8]]

Another demonstration of Beethoven’s consummate skill at obtaining the maximum variety out of seemingly unprepossessing and fairly simple material can be found in the first movement of the [[Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 5|Piano Concerto No. 5]] in E flat (‘The Emperor’) Opus 73 (1810). The [[sonata form|second subject of the sonata form]] is a deceptively simple tune that, according to Fiske (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;41) “is limited to notes playable on the horns for which it must have been specially designed.”&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme appears in five different orchestrations throughout the movement, with changes of [[Mode (music)|mode]] (major to minor), [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] ([[forte (music)|forte]] to [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]]) and a blending of instrumental [[Timbre|colour]] that ranges from boldly stated [[tutti]] passages to the most subtle and differentiated episodes, where instrumental sounds are combined often in quite unexpected ways:[[File:Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor).wav|thumb|Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor)]][[File:Subsidiary theme from the first movement of beethoven's Piano Conxcert No. 5 (Emperor).png|thumb|center|600px|Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor)]]

The theme first appears in the minor mode during the orchestral introduction, performed using [[staccato]] articulation and orchestrated in the most delicate and enchanting colours:[[File:Minor version of the theme.wav|thumb|Minor version of the theme]][[File:Minor version 1.png|thumb|center|500px|Minor version of the theme.]] This is followed by a more straightforward version in the major key, with horns accompanied by strings.  The theme is now played [[legato]] by the horns, accompanied by a sustained [[pedal point]] in the bassoons.  The violins simultaneously play an elaborated version of the theme.  (See also [[heterophony]].)  The timpani and [[pizzicato]] lower strings add further colour to this variegated palette of sounds. “Considering that the notes are virtually the same the difference in effect is extraordinary”:&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.41), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody.wav|thumb|Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody]][[File:Major version of the theme.png|thumb|center|500px|Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody.]] When the solo piano enters, its right hand plays a variant of the minor version of the theme in a [[Tuplet|triplet]] rhythm, with the backing of pizzicato (plucked) strings on the off-beats:[[File:Minor version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets.wav|thumb|Minor version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets]][[File:Minor version 2 - piano.png|thumb|center|500px|Minor key version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets.]] This is followed by a bold ''[[tutti]]'' statement of the theme, &quot;with the whole orchestra thumping it out in aggressive semi-[[staccato]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.42), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Tutti statement of the theme.wav|thumb|Tutti statement of the theme]]:[[File:Tutti version in major.png|thumb|center|500px|Tutti statement of the theme.]] The minor version of the theme also appears in the [[cadenza]], played staccato by the solo piano:[[File:Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza.wav|thumb|Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza]][[File:Cadenza.png|thumb|center|500px|Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza.]] This is followed, finally, by a restatement of the major key version, featuring horns playing legato , accompanied by pizzicato strings and [[filigree]] arpeggio figuration in the solo piano:[[File:Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza.wav|thumb|Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza]][[File:Major version in cadenza.png|thumb|center|500px|Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza. ]] Fiske (1970) says that Beethoven shows “a superb flood of invention” through these varied treatments.  “The variety of moods this theme can convey is without limit” .”&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.42), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlioz===

The most significant orchestral innovator of the early 19th century was Hector [[Berlioz]].  (The composer was also the author of a ''[[Treatise on Instrumentation]]''.) “He was drawn to the orchestra as his chosen medium by instinct … and by finding out the exact capabilities and [[timbres]] of individual instruments, and it was on this raw material that his imagination worked to produce countless new sonorities, very striking when considered as a totality, crucially instructive for later composers, and nearly all exactly tailored to their dramatic or expressive purpose.”&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, H. (1969, p5) ''Berlioz Orchestral Music''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous examples of Berlioz’s orchestral wizardry and his penchant for conjuring extraordinary sonorities can be found in his ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''.  The opening of the fourth movement, entitled “March to the Scaffold” features what for the time (1830) must have seemed a bizarre mix of sounds.  The timpani and the double basses play thick chords against the snarling muted brass: [[File:March to the Scaffold bars 1-4 for audio.wav|thumb|March to the Scaffold from the ''Symphonie fantastique'']][[File:March to the Scaffold bars 1-4.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, March to the Scaffold from the ''Symphonie fantastique'']]

“Although he derives from Beethoven, Berlioz uses features that run counter to the rules of composition in general, such as the chords in close position in the low register of the double basses.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (203, p.44) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlioz was also capable of conveying great delicacy in his instrumental writing.  A particularly spectacular instance is the “[[Queen Mab]]” scherzo from the ''[[Romeo et Juliette]]'' symphony, which [[Hugh Macdonald]] (1969, p51) describes as “Berlioz’s supreme exercise in light orchestral texture, a brilliant, gossamer fabric, [[prestissimo]] and [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]] almost without pause: [[File:Berlioz, Queen Mab Scherzo, opening bars.wav|thumb|Berlioz, Queen Mab scherzo from Romeo et Juliette]][[File:Queen Mab main theme.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, Queen Mab scherzo from Romeo et Juliette]]

Boulez points out that the very fast tempo must have made unprecedented demands on conductors and orchestras of the time (1830), “Because of the rapid and precise rhythms, the staccatos which must be even and regular in all registers, because of the isolated notes that occur right at the end of the bar on the third quaver…all of which must fall into place with absolutely perfect precision.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (203, p.37) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;
Macdonald highlights the passage towards the end of the scherzo where “The sounds become more ethereal and fairylike, low clarinet, high harps and the bell-like antique cymbals…The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned.”&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, H. (1969, p51) Berlioz orchestral Music.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:From Berlioz, Queen Mab scherzo.wav|thumb|Berlioz, orchestral texture from Queen Mab scherzo]][[File:Queen mab scherzo p218.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, orchestral texture from Queen Mab scherzo]] The [[New Grove Dictionary]] says that for Berlioz, orchestration “was intrinsic to composition, not something applied to finished music...in his hands [[timbre]] became something that could be used in free combinations, as an artist might use his palette, without bowing to the demands of line, and this leads to the rich orchestral resource of Debussy and Ravel.”&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, H., (2001) “Berlioz”, article in Sadie, S. (ed.) ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition.  London, MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wagner===

After Berlioz, [[Richard Wagner]] was the major pioneer in the development of orchestration during the 19th century. [[Pierre Boulez]] speaks of the “sheer richness of Wagner’s orchestration and his irrepressible instinct for innovation.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (1986, p273) Orientations.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Latham says that Wagner had a “unique appreciation of the possibilities for colour inherent in the instruments at his disposal, and it was this that guided him both in his selection of new recruits for the orchestral family and in his treatment of its established members. The well-known division of that family into strings, woodwind, and brass, with percussion as required, he inherited from the great classical symphonists such changes as he made were in the direction of splitting up these groups still further.” Latham gives as an example, the sonority of the opening of the opera ''[[Lohengrin]]'', where “the ethereal quality of the music” is due to the violins being “divided up into four, five, or even eight parts instead of the customary two.”&lt;ref&gt;Latham, P. (1926) “Wagner: Aesthetics and Orchestration.” Gramophone, June 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Prelude to Lohengrin condensed score.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Prelude to Lohengrin [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqk4bcnBqls Listen]]] &quot;The A major chord with which the ''Lohengrin'' Prelude begins, in the high register, using [[harmonics]] and held for a long time, lets us take in all its detail. It is undoubtedly an A major chord, but it is also high strings, harmonics, long notes - which gives it all its expressivity, but an expressivity in which the acoustic features play a central role, as we have still heard neither melody nor harmonic progression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (2005, p.361) ''Music Lessons'', trans. Dunsby, Goldman and Whittal, 2018. London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he matured as a composer, particularly through his experience of composing [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|''The Ring'']] Wagner made “increasing use of the contrast between pure and mixed [[Timbre|colours]], bringing to a fine point the art of transition from one field of sonority to another.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (1986, p273) Orientations.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in the evocative &quot;Fire Music&quot; that concludes ''[[Die Walküre]]'', &quot;the multiple [[arpeggio|arpeggiations]] of the wind chords and the [[contrapuntal motion|contrary motion]] in the strings create an oscillation of tone-colours almost literally matching the visual flickering of the flames.” &lt;ref&gt; Boulez, P. (2018, p.524) ''Music Lessons'', trans. Dunsby, Goldman and Whittal, 2018. London, Faber. &lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Wagner Fire Music from Die Walkure 01.wav|thumb|Wagner Fire Music from ''Die Walküre'']][[File:Wagner Fire Music from Die Walkure 02.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner Fire Music from ''Die Walküre'']][[Robert Craft]] found Wagner's final opera ''[[Parsifal]]'' to be a work where “Wagner’s powers are at their pinnacle… The orchestral blends and separations are without precedent.”&lt;ref&gt;Craft, R. (1977, p.82.  Current Convictions. London, Secker &amp; Warburg. &lt;/ref&gt;   Craft cites the intricate orchestration of the single line of melody that opens the opera:[[File:Parsifal Prelude Opening 01.wav|thumb|Parsifal Prelude Opening]][[File:Parsifal Prelude Opening.png|thumb|center|500px|Parsifal Prelude Opening]]

“''Parsifal'' makes entirely new uses of orchestral colour… Without the help of the score, even a very sensitive ear cannot distinguish the instruments playing the unison beginning of the Prelude.  The violins are halved, then doubled by the cellos, a clarinet, and a bassoon, as well as, for the peak of the phrase, an alto oboe [cor anglais]. The full novelty of this colour change with the oboe, both as intensity and as timbre, can be appreciated only after the theme is repeated in harmony and in one of the most gorgeous orchestrations of even Wagner’s Technicolor [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQOfIENN2tk imagination].”&lt;ref&gt;Craft, R. (1977, p.91.  ''Current Convictions''. London, Secker &amp; Warburg. &lt;/ref&gt;
Later, during the opening scene of the first act of ''[[Parsifal]]'', Wagner offsets the bold brass with gentler strings, showing that the same musical material feels very different when passed between contrasting families of instruments:[[File:Parsifal contrasting groups for audio.wav|thumb|Contrasting orchestral groups from the Prelude to the first Act of Parsifal]][[File:Parsifal contrasting groups.png|thumb|center|500px|Contrasting orchestral groups from the Prelude to first Act of Parsifal]]

=== Vice presidential campaign ===
Humphrey's defeat in 1960 had a profound influence on his thinking; after the primaries he told friends that, as a relatively poor man in politics, he was unlikely to ever become President unless he served as Vice President first.&lt;ref&gt;Solberg, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Humphrey believed that only in this way could he attain the funds, nationwide organization, and visibility he would need to win the Democratic nomination. So as the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential campaign]] began, Humphrey made clear his interest in becoming Lyndon Johnson's running mate. At the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]], Johnson kept the three likely vice-presidential candidates, Connecticut Senator [[Thomas J. Dodd|Thomas Dodd]], fellow Minnesota Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]], and Humphrey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBvIFG6q4AkC&amp;pg=PA209|title=When Freedom Would Triumph: The Civil Rights Struggle in Congress, 1954–1968|author=Robert Mann|isbn=978-0807132500|publisher=LSU Press|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the rest of the nation, in suspense before announcing his choice of Humphrey with much fanfare, praising his qualifications at considerable length before announcing his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pomper|first=Gerald|title=The Nomination of Hubert Humphrey for Vice President|url=http://huberthumphreytribute.wordpress.com/2014/02/18/the-nomination-of-hubert-humphrey-for-vice-president/|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day Humphrey's acceptance speech overshadowed Johnson's own acceptance address:

{{quote|Hubert warmed up with a long tribute to the President, then hit his stride as he began a rhythmic jabbing and chopping at [[Barry Goldwater]]. &quot;Most Democrats and Republicans in the Senate voted for an $11.5&amp;nbsp;billion tax cut for American citizens and American business,&quot; he cried, &quot;but not Senator Goldwater. Most Democrats and Republicans in the Senate – in fact four-fifths of the members of his own party – voted for the Civil Rights Act, but not Senator Goldwater.&quot;

Time after time, he capped his indictments with the drumbeat cry: &quot;But not Senator Goldwater!&quot; The delegates caught the cadence and took up the chant. A quizzical smile spread across Humphrey's face, then turned to a laugh of triumph. Hubert was in fine form. He knew it. The delegates knew it. And no one could deny that Hubert Humphrey would be a formidable political antagonist in the weeks ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Man Who Quit Kicking the Wall|work=Time|date=September 4, 1964|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,830552-6,00.html|accessdate=May 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an address before labor leaders in [[Youngstown, Ohio]] on September 7, 1964, Humphrey said the labor movement had &quot;more at stake in this election than almost any other segment of society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/09/08/page/1/article/bid-for-union-backing-made-by-humphrey|title=Bid For Union Backing Made by Humphrey|date=September 8, 1964|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jamesburg, New Jersey]] on September 10, Humphrey remarked that Goldwater had a &quot;record of retreat and reaction&quot; when it came to issues of urban housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/09/11/page/3/article/humphrey-assails-barry-on-housing|title=Humphrey Assails Barry on Housing|date=September 11, 1964|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a September 12 [[Denver]] Democratic rally, Humphrey charged Goldwater with having rejected programs that most Americans and members of his own party supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/09/13/page/3/article/goldwater-is-no-man-says-sen-humphrey|title=Goldwater Is 'No' Man, Says Sen.

During a September 27 appearance in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, Humphrey said the Kennedy administration had led America in a prosperous direction and called for voters to issue a referendum with their vote against &quot;those who seek to replace the Statue of Liberty with an iron-padlocked gate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/09/28/page/26/article/humphrey-hits-g-o-p-view-on-immigration|title=Humphrey Hits G.O.P.

At Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California, on October 2, Humphrey said the general election would give voters a choice between his running mate and a candidate &quot;who curses the darkness and never lights a candle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/10/03/page/8/article/barry-scored-by-humphrey-in-california|title=Barry Scored by Humphrey in California|date=October 3, 1964|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an October 9 [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] appearance, Humphrey responded to critics of the administration, who he called &quot;sick and tired Americans&quot;, by touting the accomplishments of both Kennedy's and Johnson's presidencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/10/10/page/10/article/sick-and-tired-americans-hit-by-humphrey|title='Sick and Tired Americans' Hit By Humphrey|date=October 9, 1964|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tampa, Florida]] on October 18, a week after the resignation of [[Walter Jenkins]] amid a scandal, Humphrey said he was unaware of any potential security leaks relating to the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/10/19/page/9/article/hubert-sad-over-jenkins-case|title=Hubert Sad Over Jenkins Case| date=October 19, 1964|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Minneapolis]] on October 24, Humphrey listed the censure vote toward Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], the civil rights bill, and the nuclear test ban treaty as &quot;three great issues of conscience to come before the United States Senate in the past decade&quot; that Goldwater had voted incorrectly on as a Senator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/10/25/page/2/article/humphrey-hits-barrys-no-on-great-issues|title=Humphrey Hits Barry's 'No' on 'Great Issues'|date=October 25, 1964|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 26 speech in Chicago, Humphrey called Goldwater &quot;neither a Republican nor a Democrat&quot; and &quot;a radical&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/10/27/page/1/article/15-000-in-loop-for-humphrey|title=15,000 In Loop For Humphrey|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 27, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vice President-elect of the United States ===
On November 6, 1964, Humphrey traveled to the [[Virgin Islands]] for a two-week vacation ahead of assuming office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/11/09/page/18/article/hubert-rests-friends-fish-in-virgin-isles|title=Humphrey Rests, Friends Fish in Virgin Isles|date=November 9, 1964|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; News stations aired taped remarks in which Humphrey stated that he had not discussed with President Johnson what his role would be as Vice President and that national campaigns should be reduced by four weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/11/09/page/18/article/shorter-campaigns-urged-by-humphrey|title=Shorter Campaigns Urged by Humphrey|date=November 9, 1964|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on November 20, Humphrey announced he would resign his Senate seat midway through the following month so that [[Walter Mondale]] could assume the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/11/21/page/7/article/hubert-to-quit-senate-job-in-mid-december|title=Hubert To Quit Senate Job in Mid-December|date=November 20, 1964|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 1964, Humphrey met with President Johnson in the Oval Office, the latter charging the vice president-elect with &quot;developing a publicity machine extraordinaire and of always wanting to get his name in the paper.&quot; Johnson showed Humphrey a George Reed memo with the allegation that the president would die within six months from an already acquired fatal heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=LBJ: Architect of American Ambition|first=Randall|last=Woods|page=555|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0674026995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, during a speech in Washington, President Johnson announced Humphrey would have the position of giving assistance to governmental civil rights programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/12/11/page/2/article/johnson-gives-humphrey-key-rights-task|title=Johnson Gives Humphrey Key Rights Task|date=December 10, 1964|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 19, 1965, the day before the inauguration, Vice President-elect Humphrey told the [[Democratic National Committee]] that the party had unified because of the national consensus established by the presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1965/01/20/page/5/article/64-campaign-forged-party-unity-hubert|title='64 Campaign Forged Party Unity: Hubert|date=January 20, 1965|first=Russell|last=Freeburg|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vice Presidency (1965–1969)==
[[File:Hubert Humphrey 1965.jpg|thumb|Vice President Humphrey at a meeting in the [[Oval Office]], June 21, 1965]]
Humphrey took office on January 20, 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mctKh-DcEOY|title=Inauguration of the President and Vice President, 1/20/1965|last=TheLBJLibrary|date=August 2, 2012|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; ending the 14-month vacancy of the Vice President of the United States, which had remained empty when then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the Presidency after the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlibrary.org/press/lbj-in-the-news/looking-back-january-20-1965|title=Looking back – January 20, 1965|publisher=lbjlib.utexas.edu|date=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an early skeptic of the then growing [[Vietnam War]]. Following a successful [[Viet Cong]] hit-and-run [[Attack on Camp Holloway|attack on a US military installation at Pleiku]] on February 7, 1965 (where 7 Americans were killed and 109 wounded), Humphrey returned from Georgia to Washington D.C., to attempt to prevent further escalation.&lt;ref name=&quot;T. Hoopes, p31&quot;&gt;T. Hoopes, ''The Limits of Intervention'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He told President Johnson that bombing [[North Vietnam]] was not a solution to the problems in [[South Vietnam]], but that bombing would require the injection of US ground forces into South Vietnam to protect the airbases.&lt;ref name=&quot;T. Hoopes, p31&quot; /&gt; Presciently, he noted that a military solution in Vietnam would take several years, well beyond the next election cycle. In response to this advice, President Johnson punished Humphrey by treating him coldly and restricting him from his inner circle for a number of months, until Humphrey decided to &quot;get back on the team&quot; and fully support the war effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;T. Hoopes, p31&quot; /&gt;

As Vice President, Humphrey was criticized for his complete and vocal loyalty to Johnson and the policies of the Johnson Administration, even as many of his liberal admirers opposed the president's policies with increasing fervor regarding the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphrey Wilson Center&quot;/&gt; Many of Humphrey's liberal friends and allies abandoned him because of his refusal to publicly criticize Johnson's Vietnam War policies. Humphrey's critics later learned that Johnson had threatened Humphrey – Johnson told Humphrey that if he publicly criticized his policies, he would destroy Humphrey's chances to become President by opposing his nomination at the next Democratic Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Solberg, pp. 282–284.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Humphrey's critics were vocal and persistent: even his nickname, &quot;the Happy Warrior&quot;, was used against him. The nickname referred not to his military hawkishness, but rather to his crusading for social welfare and civil rights programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphrey Wilson Center&quot;/&gt; After his narrow defeat in the 1968 presidential election, Humphrey wrote that &quot;After four years as Vice-President ... I had lost some of my personal identity and personal forcefulness. ... I ought not to have let a man [Johnson] who was going to be a former President dictate my future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Solberg, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was Vice President, Hubert Humphrey was the subject of a satirical song by songwriter/musician [[Tom Lehrer]] entitled &quot;Whatever Became of Hubert?&quot; The song addressed how some liberals and [[progressivism|progressives]] felt let down by Humphrey, who had become a much more mute figure as Vice President than he had been as a senator. The song goes ''&quot;Whatever became of Hubert? Has anyone heard a thing? Once he shone on his own, now he sits home alone and waits for the phone to ring. Once a fiery liberal spirit, ah, but now when he speaks he must clear it. ...&quot; ''

During these years Humphrey was a repeated and favorite guest of [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/122519894.html|title=10 tidbits about Hubert H.

He also appeared on ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' in 1973.

[[File:Gemini 4 Astronauts Meet Yuri Gagarin.jpg|thumb|Humphrey with Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini 4]] astronauts at the 1965 [[Paris Air Show]]]]
On April 15, 1965, Humphrey delivered an address to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, pledging the incumbent session of Congress would &quot;do more for the lasting long-term health of this nation&quot; since the initial session in office at the time of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] assuming the presidency in 1933 and predicting 13 major measures of President Johnson's administration would be passed ahead of the session's conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1965/04/16/page/9/article/editors-hear-humphreys-glowing-forecast-for-u-s|title=Editors Hear Humphrey's Glowing Forecast For U.S.|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=April 16, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-May 1965, Humphrey traveled to [[Dallas]], Texas for an off-the-record discussion with donors of President Johnson's campaign. During the visit, Humphrey was imposed tight security as a result of the JFK assassination a year and a half prior and the mother of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was placed under surveillance by Police Chief Cato Hightower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1965/05/18/page/31/article/guard-hubert-closely-on-dallas-visit|title=Guard Hubert Closely On Dallas Visit|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=May 18, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a May 31, 1966 appearance at Huron College, Humphrey said the US should not expect &quot;either friendship or gratitude&quot; in helping poorer countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1966/06/01/page/34/article/dont-expect-gratitude-for-aid-humphrey|title=Don't Expect Gratitude for Aid: Humphrey|date=June 1, 1966|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a September 22, 1966 [[Jamesburg, New Jersey]] Democratic Party fundraiser, Humphrey said the Vietnam War would be shortened if the US stayed firm and hastened the return of troops: &quot;We are making a decision not only to defend Vietnam, we are defending the United States of America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1966/09/23/page/7/article/humphrey-answers-heckler-on-viet-nam-war-lssue|title=Humphrey Answers Hecklers on Viet Nam War Issue|date=September 23, 1966|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a May 1967 news conference, Humphrey said American anger toward Vietnam was losing traction and that he could see a growth in popularity for President Johnson since a low point five months prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19670527&amp;id=H1cmAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2381,2801833|title=Humphrey at 56 Gives His Views on Life|first=Robert E.|last=Geiger|work=Gettysburg Times|date=May 27, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an August 2, 1967 appearance in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], Humphrey proposed each state consider forming peacekeeping councils focused on preventing violence, gaining community cooperation, and listening to &quot;the voices of those who have gone unheard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1967/08/03/page/1/article/hubert-idea-end-unrest-by-spending|title=Hubert Idea: End Unrest by Spending|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 2, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 1967, Humphrey cited [[Malaysia]] as an example of what Vietnam could resemble post a Viet Cong defeat while in [[Jakarta, Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1967/11/04/page/4/article/viet-can-win-as-malays-did-humphrey|title=Viet Can Win as Malays Did: Humphrey|date=November 4, 1967|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil rights ===
In February 1965, President Johnson appointed Humphrey to the chairmanship of the President's Council on Equal Opportunity.&lt;ref name=Dallek224 /&gt; The position and board had been proposed by Humphrey, who told Johnson that the board should consist of members of the Cabinet and federal agency leaders and serve multiple roles: assisting agency cooperation, creating federal program consistency, using advanced planning to avoid potential racial unrest, creating public policy, and meeting with local and state level leaders.&lt;ref name=Thurber171&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of Equality|pages=171–172|first=Timothy|last=Thurber|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231110471|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, he appointed Wiley A.

Johnson told Humphrey he would shorten his role within the administration's civil rights policies and pass a portion to Katzenbach, Califano writing that Humphrey agreed to go along with the plan reluctantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Triumph &amp; Tragedy of Lyndon Johnson: The White House Years|first=Joseph A.|last=Caulifano|page=56|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=978-1476798790|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 1967 speech at a county officials national convention in Detroit, Michigan, Humphrey called for the establishment of a [[Marshall Plan]] that would curb poverty in the United States as well as address racial violence, and advocated for the creation of civil peace councils that would counter rioting. He said the councils should include representation from all minority groups and religions, state governments, the National Guard, and law enforcement agencies and that the United States would see itself out of trouble only when law and order was reestablished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8_tS2Vw13FcC&amp;dat=19670803&amp;printsec=frontpage|title=Marshall Plan in U.S. Urged By Humphrey|date=August 3, 1967|newspaper=Toledo Blade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign trips ===
December 1965 saw the beginning of Humphrey's tour of eastern countries, saying he hoped to have &quot;cordial and frank discussions&quot; ahead of the trip beginning when asked about the content of the talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1965/12/28/page/3/article/humphrey-begins-asian-trip|title=Humphrey Begins Asian Trip|date=December 28, 1965|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a December 29 meeting with [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Eisaku Satō]], Humphrey asked the latter for support on achieving peace in the Vietnam War and said it was a showing of strength that the United States wanted a peaceful ending rather than a display of weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1965/12/29/page/3/article/humphrey-asks-japans-aid|title=Humphrey Asks Japan's Aid|date=December 29, 1969|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humphrey began a European tour in late-March 1967 to mend frazzled relations and indicated that he was &quot;ready to explain and ready to listen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1967/03/27/page/11/article/humphrey-begins-europe-tour|title=Humphrey Begins Europe Tour|date=March 27, 1967|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 1967, Vice President Humphrey met with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Harold Wilson]].

Following the announcement from Johnson, Humphrey announced his presidential candidacy on April 27, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5a0wf4HHRVgC&amp;pg=PA375|title=The Columbia Guide to America in The 1960s|author=David Rosenthal Farber|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231113731|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declaring his candidacy in a speech in Washington, DC alongside Senators [[Fred R. Harris|Fred Harris]] of [[Oklahoma]] and [[Walter Mondale]] of Minnesota (who both served as the co-chairs to his campaign), Humphrey stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here we are, just as we ought to be, here we are, the people, here we are the spirit of dedication, here we are the way politics ought to be in America, the politics of happiness, politics of purpose, politics of joy; and that's the way it's going to be, all the way, too, from here on out. We seek an America able to preserve and nurture all the basic rights of free expression, yet able to reach across the divisions that too often separate race from race, region from region, young from old, worker from scholar, rich from poor. We seek an America able to do this in the higher knowledge that our goals and ideals are worthy of conciliation and personal sacrifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCSB Remarks Declaring Candidacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=77814|title=Remarks Declaring Candidacy for the Democratic Presidential Nomination|author1=Gerhard Peters |author2=John T.

Also in his speech, Humphrey supported President Johnson's Vietnam initiative he proposed during his address to the nation four weeks earlier;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCSB Remarks Declaring Candidacy&quot;/&gt; partially halting the bombings in North Vietnam, while sending an additional 13,500 troops and increasing the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense's]] budget by 4% over the next fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/johnson-announces-bombing-halt|title=Vietnam War: Johnson announces bombing halt|publisher=History Channel|date=March 31, 1968|access-date=June 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826104225/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/johnson-announces-bombing-halt|archive-date=August 26, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the campaign, Humphrey opposed a proposal by Senators McCarthy and [[George McGovern]] of [[South Dakota]] to the Democratic Convention's Policy Committee, calling for an immediate end to the bombings in Vietnam, an early withdrawal of troops and setting talks for a [[coalition government]] with the Viet Cong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00442/pdfa/00442-02684.pdf|title=Meet the Press: America's Press Conference of the Air|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]]|date=August 25, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hubert H. Humphrey 1968 presidential campaign..jpg|thumb|230px|left|Hubert Humphrey campaigning for President in 1968]]
Many people saw Humphrey as Johnson's stand-in; he won major backing from the nation's labor unions and other Democratic groups troubled by young antiwar protesters and the social unrest around the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHH Papers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00720/pdf/hhh41.pdf|title=HUBERT H. HUMPHREY PAPERS An Inventory of His 1968 Presidential Campaign Files|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of British journalists wrote that Humphrey, despite his liberal record on civil rights and support for a nuclear test-ban treaty, &quot;had turned into an arch-apologist for the war, who was given to trotting around Vietnam looking more than a little silly in olive-drab fatigues and a forage cap. The man whose name had been a by-word in the South for softness toward Negroes had taken to lecturing black groups ... the wild-eyed reformer had become the natural champion of every conservative element in the Democratic Party.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chester, p. 147&quot;/&gt; Humphrey entered the race too late to participate in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1968|Democratic primaries]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/1968-democratic-convention.html|title=1968 Democratic Convention The Bosses Strike Back|author=Haynes Johnson|work=Smithsonian Magazine|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concentrated on winning delegates in non-primary states by gaining the support of Democratic officeholders who were elected delegates to the Democratic Convention.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHH Papers&quot;/&gt; By June, McCarthy won in Oregon and Pennsylvania, while Kennedy had won in Indiana and Nebraska, though Humphrey was the front runner as he led the delegate count.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHH Papers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMCA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumca.org/theoaklandstandard/mr-kennedy-and-1968-battle-california|title=Mr. Kennedy and the 1968 Battle for California|author=Matthew Harrison Tedford|publisher=[[Oakland Museum of California]]|date=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California primary was crucial for [[Robert F.

===Chicago riots and party fallout===
Humphrey did not enter any of the 13 state primary elections,&lt;ref&gt;Jennings &amp; Brewster 1998: 413.&lt;/ref&gt; but won the Democratic nomination at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention|party convention]] in Chicago, even though 80 percent of the primary voters had been for antiwar candidates. The delegates defeated the peace plank by 1,567{{sfrac|3|4}} to 1,041{{sfrac|1|4}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gitlin 1987: 331&quot;&gt;Gitlin 1987: 331.&lt;/ref&gt; Humphrey selected as his [[running mate]] Senator [[Ed Muskie]] of Maine. Unfortunately for Humphrey and his campaign, in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], just five miles south of [[International Amphitheatre]] convention hall (closed 1999), and at other sites near downtown Chicago, there were [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|gatherings and protests]] by thousands of [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|antiwar demonstrators]], many of whom favored McCarthy, [[George McGovern]], or other antiwar candidates. Chicago police attacked and beat these protesters, most of them young college students, which amplified the growing feelings of unrest among the public.

Humphrey's inaction during these incidents, President Johnson and Chicago [[Mayor of Chicago|Mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley|Richard Daley]]'s behind-the-scenes maneuvers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gitlin 1987: 331&quot;/&gt; public backlash against Humphrey's winning the nomination without entering a single primary, and Humphrey's refusal to meet McCarthy halfway on his demands,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Eugene's Stand Saddens HHH&quot;, The Daily Collegian, University Park, PA, 69 (16), p. 4, October 10, 1968, archived from the original on March 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in McCarthy's refusal to fully endorse him, highlighted turmoil in the Democratic Party's base that proved to be too much for Humphrey to overcome in time for the general election. The combination of Johnson's unpopularity, the Chicago demonstrations, and the discouragement of liberals and African-Americans after the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] that year, all contributed to his loss to former Vice President Nixon.

Although he lost the November [[1968 United States presidential election|election]] by less than one percent of the popular vote, with 43.4% for Nixon (31,783,783 votes) to 42.7% (31,271,839&lt;!-- votes--&gt;) for Humphrey, and 13.5% (9,901,118&lt;!-- votes --&gt;) for [[George Wallace]]. Humphrey carried just 13 states with 191 electoral college votes, Nixon carried 32 states and 301 electoral votes, and Wallace carried five states and 46 electoral votes. In&amp;nbsp;his concession speech, Humphrey said, &quot;I have done my best. I have lost; Mr. Nixon has won. The democratic process has worked its&amp;nbsp;will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/1968-Presidential-Election/12303153093431-2/|title=1968 Presidential Election – Events of 1968 – Year in Review|agency=United Press International|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the Vice Presidency, Humphrey taught at [[Macalester College]] and the [[University of Minnesota]], and served as chairman of the board of consultants at the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Educational Corporation.

On February 11, 1969, Humphrey met privately with Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] and denied ever being &quot;at war&quot; with Daley during a press conference later in the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/02/12/page/10/article/humphrey-visits-hails-daley-in-effort-to-unify-democrats|title=Humphrey Visits, Hails Daley in Effort to Unify Democrats|date=February 12, 1969|first=Edward|last=Schreiber|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, Humphrey declined answering questions on the Johnson administration being either involved or privy to the cessation of bombing of the north in Vietnam during an interview on ''[[Issues and Answers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/03/10/page/8/article/hubert-shuns-talk-of-deal-on-bomb-halt|title=Hubert Shuns Talk of Deal On Bomb Halt|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a press conference on June 2, 1969, Humphrey backed Nixon's peace efforts, dismissing the notion that he was not seeking an end to the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/06/03/page/29/article/hubert-backs-nixon-efforts-on-viet-peace|title=Hubert Backs Nixon Efforts on Viet Peace|date=June 2, 1969|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early July, Humphrey traveled to Finland for a private visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/07/08/page/9/article/humphrey-in-finland-on-his-european-tour|title=Humphrey in Finland on His European Tour|date=July 8, 1969|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Humphrey returned to Washington after visiting Europe, a week after McCarthy declared he would not seek reelection, Humphrey declining to comment amid speculation he intended to return to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/07/27/page/7/article/hubert-wont-comment-on-his-political-future|title=Hubert Won't Comment on His Political Future|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=July 27, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fall, Humphrey arranged to meet with President Nixon through [[United States National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]], Humphrey saying the day after the meeting that President Nixon had &quot;expressed his appreciation on my attitude to his effort on Vietnam.&quot;&lt;ref name=Solberg417&gt;Solberg, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 3, Humphrey said that Russia was buying time to develop ballistic missile warheads to catch up with the United States and that security was the &quot;overriding concern&quot; of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/08/04/page/14/article/russ-stalling-arms-talks-humphrey|title=Russ Stalling Arms Talks – Humphrey|date=August 4, 1969|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, Humphrey repudiated efforts against President Nixon's anti-ballistic missile system: &quot;I have a feeling that they [opponents of the ABM] were off chasing rabbits when a tiger is loose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/08/08/page/5/article/abm-fight-a-waste-of-time-hubert-says|title=ABM Fight a Waste of Time, Hubert Says|first=Russell|last=Freeburg|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 8, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; During October, Humphrey spoke before the AFL-CIO convention delegates, charging President Nixon's economic policies with &quot;putting Americans out of work without slowing inflation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/10/07/page/40/article/hubert-rips-nixon-tight-money-policy|title=Hubert Rips Nixon, Tight Money Policy|date=October 7, 1969|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, Humphrey stated his support for Nixon's policies in Vietnam and that he believed &quot;the worst thing that we can do is to try to undermine the efforts of the President.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/10/11/page/19/article/hubert-backs-nixon-policies-on-viet-nam|title=Hubert Backs Nixon Policies on Viet Nam|date=October 11, 1969|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a December 21 press conference, Humphrey said President Nixon was a participant in the &quot;politics of polarization&quot; and could not seek unity on one hand but have divisive agents on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/12/22/page/1/article/nixon-is-polarizing-people-hubert-says|title=Nixon is Polarizing People, Hubert Says|date=December 22, 1969|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 26, Humphrey responded to a claim from former President Johnson that Humphrey had been cost the election by his own call for a stop to North Vietnam bombing, saying he did what he &quot;thought was right and responsible at Salt Lake City.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/12/27/page/2/article/hubert-answers-lbj-criticism|title=Hubert Answers LBJ Criticism|date=December 26, 1969|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 1970, Humphrey said the United States should cease tests of nuclear weapons during the continued conversations for potential strategic arms limitations between the United States and the Soviet Union while speaking to the National Retail Furniture association at the Palmer House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1970/01/05/page/8/article/halt-nuclear-arms-tests-hubert-says|title=Halt Nuclear Arms Talks, Hubert Says|first=Stephen|last=Crews|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 5, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Humphrey predicted Nixon would withdraw 75,000 or more troops prior to the year's midterm elections and the main issue would be the economy during an interview: &quot;The issue of 1970 is the economy. Some of my fellow Democrats don't believe this. But this is a fact.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1970/02/10/page/2/article/hubert-sees-economy-as-key-election-issue-next-autumn|title=Hubert Sees Economy as Key Election Issue Next Autumn|date=February 10, 1970|first=Russell|last=Freeburg|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 23, Humphrey disclosed his recommendation to [[Larry O'Brien]] for the latter to return to being Chair of the [[Democratic National Committee]], a Humphrey spokesman reporting that Humphrey wanted a quick settlement to the issue of the DNC chairmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1970/02/24/page/20/article/hubert-asks-obrien-to-be-chief-of-dems|title=Hubert Asks O'Brien To Be Chief of Dems|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=February 24, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solberg wrote of President Nixon's April 1970 [[Cambodian Campaign]] as having done away with Humphrey's hopes that the war be taken out of political context.&lt;ref name=Solberg417 /&gt; In May, Humphrey pledged to do all that he was capable of to provide additional war planes to Israel and stress the issue to American leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/08/archives/humphrey-assures-israelis.html|title=Humphrey Assures Israeli|date=May 8, 1970|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid an August 11 address to the American Bar Association luncheon meeting, Humphrey called for liberals to cease defending campus radicals and militants and align with law and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1970/08/12/page/3/article/support-law-and-order-humphrey-tells-liberals|title=Support Law and Order, Humphrey Tells Liberals|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 12, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humphrey had not planned to return to political life, but an unexpected opportunity changed his mind. McCarthy, who was up for reelection in [[1970 United States Senate election in Minnesota|1970]], realized that he had only a slim chance of winning even re-nomination for the Minnesota seat because he had angered his party by opposing Johnson and Humphrey for the 1968 presidential nomination, and declined to run. Humphrey won the nomination, defeated Republican Congressman [[Clark MacGregor]], and returned to the U.S. Senate on January 3, 1971. Ahead of resuming his senatorial duties, Humphrey had a November 16, 1970 White House meeting with President Nixon as part of a group of newly elected senators invited to meet with the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1970/11/17/page/3/article/humphrey-pays-nixon-a-visit|title=Humphrey Pays Nixon a Visit|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=November 17, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reelected in [[1976 U.S. Senate election|1976]], and remained in office until his death. In a rarity in politics, Humphrey held both Senate seats from his state (Class I and Class II) at different times. During his return to the Senate he served in the [[92nd United States Congress|92nd]], [[93rd United States Congress|93rd]], [[94th United States Congress|94th]], and a portion of the [[95th United States Congress|95th Congress]].  He served as chairman of the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]] in the 94th Congress.

=== Fourth Senate term ===
L. Edward Purcell wrote that upon returning to the Senate, Humphrey found himself &quot;again a lowly junior senator with no seniority&quot; and that he resolved to create credibility in the eyes of liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vice Presidents: A Biographical Dictionary|pages=[https://archive.org/details/vicepresidents00ledw/page/370 370–372]|publisher=Facts on File|year=2001|isbn=978-0816046157|url=https://archive.org/details/vicepresidents00ledw/page/370}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On May 3, 1971, after the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] adopted a resolution demanding President Nixon's impeachment, Humphrey commented that they were acting &quot;more out of emotion and passion than reason and prudent judgment&quot; and that the request was irresponsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/04/archives/humphrey-assails-ada-on-impeachment-of-nixon.html|title=Humphrey Assails A.D.A.

Humphrey said members of the Nixon administration needed to remember &quot;when they talk of a tough negotiating position, they are going to get a tough response.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/15/archives/humphrey-muskie-ask-missile-curb-freeze-by-us-and-soviet-proposed.html|title=HUMPHREY, MUSKIE ASK MISSILE CURB|first=John W.|last=Finney|date=July 15, 1971|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, Humphrey rebuked the Nixon administration's wage price freeze, saying it was based on trickle-down policies and advocating &quot;percolate up&quot; as a replacement, while speaking at a [[United Rubber Workers]] gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1971/09/07/page/5/article/new-fair-deal-urged-by-humphrey|date=September 7, 1971|title=New 'Fair Deal' Urged by Humphrey|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, Humphrey stated his support for removing barriers to voting registration and authorizing students to establish voting residences in their college communities, rebuking the refusal of [[United States Attorney General]] [[John N.

In January 1972, Humphrey stated the U.S. would be out of the Vietnam War by that point had he been elected President, saying Nixon was taking longer to withdraw American troops from the country than it took to defeat [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hubert-humphrey-criticizes-president-nixon|title=Hubert Humphrey criticizes President Nixon|publisher=History.com|date=January 10, 1973|access-date=September 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918021435/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hubert-humphrey-criticizes-president-nixon|archive-date=September 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, Humphrey said Nixon's proposal to limit schoolchildren busing was &quot;insufficient in the amount of aid needed for our children, deceptive to the American people, and insensitive to the laws and the Constitution of this nation&quot;, in a reversal of his prior stance, while in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/21/archives/humphrey-shifts-now-disapproves-nixon-busing-plan-backs-away-from.html|title=HUMPHREY SHIFTS, NOW DISAPPROVES NIXON BUSING PLAN|date=March 21, 1972|newspaper=The New York Times|first=Walter|last=Rugarer}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a May 30 appearance in [[Burbank, California]], Humphrey stated his support for an immediate withdrawal of American forces from South Vietnam despite an invasion by North Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/05/31/page/3/article/2d-debate-with-mcgovern|title=Humphrey Wants U.S. to Quit S.

In January 1973, Humphrey said the Nixon administration was plotting to eliminate a school milk program in the upcoming fiscal year budget during a telephone interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1973/01/02/page/21/article/humphrey-sees-school-milk-subsidy-as-next-nixon-target|title=Humphrey sees school milk subsidy as next Nixon target|date=January 2, 1973|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, 1973, Humphrey said the Middle East could possibly usher in peace following the Vietnam War ending along with American troops withdrawing from [[Indochina]] during an appearance at the New York Hilton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/19/archives/humphrey-sees-new-chance-for-peace-in-mideast.html|title=Humphrey Sees New Chance for Peace in Mideast|first=Irving|last=Spiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1973, Humphrey called on Nixon to schedule a meeting with nations exporting and importing foods as part of an effort to both create a worldwide policy on food and do away with food hoarding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1973/08/10/page/5/article/humphrey-and-ford-discuss-nixon-agnew-and-watergate|title=Humphrey and Ford discuss, Nixon, Agnew and Watergate|date=August 10, 1973|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Nixon's dismissal of [[Archibald Cox]], Humphrey said he found &quot;the whole situation entirely depressing.&quot;&lt;ref name=Solberg449&gt;Solberg, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after Cox's dismissal, during a speech to the AFL-CIO convention on October 23, Humphrey declined to state his position on whether Nixon should be impeached, citing that his congressional position would likely cause him to have to play a role in determining Nixon's fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1973/10/24/page/2/article/hubert-wont-take-impeachment-stand|title=Hubert won't take impeachment stand|first=James|last=Strong|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 24, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, Humphrey disclosed his request of federal tax deductions of US$199,153 for the donation of his vice presidential papers to the Minnesota State Historical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19731222&amp;id=o6tVAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3274,5893856|title=Humphrey releases tax data|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|date=December 22, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 1974, Humphrey checked into the [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] for tests regarding a minute tumor of the bladder. His physician Edgar Berman said the next day that Humphrey &quot;looks fine and feels fine&quot; and was expected to leave early the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1974/01/06/page/3/article/tested-after-x-ray-treatments|title=Humphrey hospitalized for tumor|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 6, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview conducted on March 29, 1974, Humphrey concurred with Senator [[Mike Mansfield]]'s assessment from the prior day that the House of Representatives had enough votes to impeach Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/30/archives/humphrey-believes-impeachment-likely.html|title=HUMPHREY BELIEVES IMPEACHMENT LIKELY|date=March 30, 1974|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humphrey was reportedly pleased by Nixon's resignation.&lt;ref name=Solberg449 /&gt;

In an April 1975 news conference at the spring education conference of the United Federation of Teachers, Humphrey cited the need for a national department of education, a national education trust fund, and a federal government provision for a third of America's educational expenses. He said the Ford administration had no educational policy and noted the United States was the only industrialized country without a separate national education department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/20/archives/separate-us-unit-on-schools-urged-humphrey-proposes-a-split-of.html|title=SEPARATE U.S. UNIT ON SCHOOLS URGED|first=C. Gerald|last=Fraser|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 20, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Humphrey testified at the trial of his former campaign manager Jack L.

Import Fee|date=August 12, 1975|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, after [[Sara Jane Moore]]'s assassination attempt on Ford, Humphrey joined former presidential candidates Barry Goldwater, Edmund Muskie, and George McGovern in urging Ford and other presidential candidates to restrain their campaigning the following year to prevent future attempts on their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/01/archives/miss-moore-tried-to-call-ford-guards-five-times-miss-moore-tried-to.html|title=Miss Moore Tried to Call Ford Guards Five Times|first=Richard D.|last=Lyons|date=October 1, 1975|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1972 Presidential election ===
[[File:Humphrey1972.gif|thumb|1972 campaign logo]]
On November 4, 1970, shortly after being elected to the Senate, Humphrey stated his intention to take on the role of a &quot;harmonizer&quot; within the Democratic Party to minimize the possibility of potential presidential candidates within the party lambasting each other prior to deciding to run in the then-upcoming election, dismissing that he was an active candidate at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/05/archives/humphrey-adopts-harmonizers-role.html|title=Humphrey Adopts Harmonizer's Role|first=Seth S.|last=King|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 5, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1971, Humphrey made his second trip to New Jersey in under a month, talking with a plurality of county leaders at the [[Robert Treat Hotel]]: &quot;I told them I wanted their support. I said I'd rather work with them than against them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/18/archives/humphrey-talks-to-jersey-chiefs-tells-them-announcement-is-coming.html|title=HUMPHREY TALKS TO JERSEY CHIEFS|first=Joseph|last=Sullivan|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 18, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Humphrey once again ran for the Democratic nomination for president, announcing his candidacy on January 10, 1972 during a twenty-minute speech in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. At the time of the announcement, Humphrey said he was running on a platform of the removal of troops from Vietnam and a revitalization of the United States economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/01/11/page/7/article/humphrey-enters-presidential-race-raps-nixons-policies|title=Humphrey Enters Presidential Race, Raps Nixon's Policies|date=January 11, 1972|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew upon continuing support from organized labor and the African-American and Jewish communities, but remained unpopular with college students because of his association with the Vietnam War, even though he had altered his position in the years since his 1968 defeat. Humphrey initially planned to skip the primaries, as he had in 1968. Even after he revised this strategy he still stayed out of New Hampshire, a decision that allowed McGovern to emerge as the leading challenger to Muskie in that state. Humphrey did win some primaries, including those in Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/11/02/page/3/article/mcgovern-gets-big-crowd-for-n-y-appearance|title=McGovern Gets Big Crowd for N.Y. Appearance|date=November 2, 1972|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indiana and Pennsylvania, but was defeated by McGovern in several others, including the crucial California primary. Humphrey also was out-organized by McGovern in caucus states and was trailing in delegates at the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Miami Beach, Florida]]. His hopes rested on challenges to the credentials of some of the McGovern delegates. For example, the Humphrey forces argued that the winner-take-all rule for the California primary violated procedural reforms intended to produce a better reflection of the popular vote, the reason that the Illinois delegation was bounced. The effort failed, as several votes on delegate credentials went McGovern's way, guaranteeing his victory.

=== 1976 Presidential election ===
[[File:Senator Hubert Humphrey and Jimmy Carter - NARA - 176625.tif|thumb|Senator Hubert Humphrey with President [[Jimmy Carter]] aboard [[Air Force One]] in 1977]]
On April 22, 1974, Humphrey said that he would not enter the upcoming Democratic presidential primary for the 1976 Presidential election. Humphrey said at the time that he was urging fellow Senator and Minnesotan [[Walter Mondale]] to run, despite believing that [[Ted Kennedy]] would enter the race as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1974/04/23/page/5/article/humphrey-wont-run-for-president-in-1976|title=Humphrey won't run for President in 1976|first=Neil|last=Mehler|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=April 23, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the election cycle, Humphrey also said, &quot;Here's a time in my life when I appear to have more support than at any other time in my life. But it's too financially, politically, and physically debilitating – and I'm just not going to do it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1975/10/20/page/15/article/humphreys-resisting-the-call-of-the-presidential-primaries|title=Humphrey's resisting the call of the presidential primaries|first=Harry|last=Kelly|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1975, a Gallup poll was released showing Humphrey and [[Ronald Reagan]] as the leading Democratic and Republican candidates for the following year's presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/28/archives/humphrey-vs-reagan.html|first=Tom|last=Wicker|title=Humphrey Vs.

On April 12, 1976, Chairman of the [[New Jersey Democratic Party]] State Senator James P. Dugan said the selection of a majority of uncommitted delegates could be interpreted as a victory for Humphrey, who had indicated his availability as a presidential candidate for the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/13/archives/humphrey-called-victor-in-jersey-uncommitted-state-to-vie-with-4.html|title=HUMPHREY CALLED VICTOR IN JERSEY|first=Ronald|last=Sullivan|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 13, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humphrey announced his choice to not enter the [[New Jersey]] primary nor authorize any committees to work to support him during an April 29, 1976 appearance in the Senate Caucus Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1976/04/30/page/1/article/tearful-humphrey-out-of-race|title=Tearful Humphrey out of race|date=April 30, 1976|first=Jon|last=Margolis|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after [[Jimmy Carter]] had won enough delegates to clinch the nomination, many still wanted Humphrey to announce his availability for a [[draft (politics)|draft]]. However, he did not do so, and Carter easily secured the nomination on the first round of balloting. Humphrey had learned that he had terminal cancer, prompting him to sit the race out.

Humphrey attended the November 17, 1976 meeting between President-elect Carter and Democratic congressional leaders in which Carter sought out support for a proposal to have the president's power to reorganize the government reinstated with potential to be vetoed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/18/archives/carter-asks-leaders-of-congress-to-help-in-a-reorganization-he-is.html|title=CARTER ASKS LEADERS OF CONGRESS TO HELP IN A REORGANIZATION|first=Warren|last=Weaver, Jr.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 18, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fifth Senate term ===
Humphrey attended the May 3, 1977 White House meeting on legislative priorities. Humphrey told President Carter that the U.S. would enter a period of high unemployment without an economic stimulus and noted that in &quot;every period in our history, a rise in unemployment has been accompanied by a rise in inflation&quot;. Humphrey stated a preventative health care program would be the only way for the Carter administration to not have to fund soaring health costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/04/archives/democrats-criticize-carter-on-priorities-congressional-leaders.html|title=DEMOCRATS CRITICIZE CARTER ON PRIORITIES|first=Martin|last=Tolchin|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 4, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1977, after the Senate began debating approval for funding of the neutron bomb, Humphrey stated that the White House had granted the impact statement on arms control be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/14/archives/senate-votes-funds-for-neutron-bombs-heeding-carter-plea-cutoff.html|title=SENATE VOTES FUNDS FOR NEUTRON BOMBS, HEEDING CARTER PLEA|date=July 14, 1977|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deputy President pro tempore of the Senate (1977–1978)===
In 1974, along with [[Augustus F. Hawkins|Rep. Augustus Hawkins]] of California, Humphrey authored the [[Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act]], the first attempt at full employment legislation. The original bill proposed to guarantee full employment to all citizens over 16 and set up a permanent system of public jobs to meet that goal. A watered-down version called the ''Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act'' passed the House and Senate in 1978. It set the goal of 4 percent unemployment and 3 percent inflation and instructed the [[Federal Reserve Board]] to try to produce those goals when making policy decisions.

====Late-1930s: tank regiment====
From April 1936, whilst still in his staff position at SGDN, de Gaulle was also a lecturer to generals at CHEM.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p125&quot;/&gt; De Gaulle's superiors disapproved of his views about tanks, and he was passed over for promotion to full colonel in 1936, supposedly because his service record was not good enough. He interceded with his political patron Reynaud, who showed his record to the Minister of War [[Édouard Daladier]]. Daladier, who was an enthusiast for rearmament with modern weapons, ensured that his name was entered onto the promotion list for the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;{{RP|109}}&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp147-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 General Bineau, who had taught him at St Cyr, wrote on his report on his lectureship at CHEM that he was highly able and suitable for high command in the future, but that he hid his attributes under &quot;a cold and lofty attitude&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p125&quot;/&gt; He was put in command of the 507th Tank Regiment (consisting of a battalion of medium [[Char D2]]s and a battalion of [[Renault R35|R35 light tanks]]) at [[Metz]] on 13 July 1937, and his promotion to full colonel took effect on 24 December that year. De Gaulle attracted public attention by leading a parade of 80 tanks into the Place d'Armes at Metz, in his command tank &quot;[[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp149-50, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

By now de Gaulle was beginning to be a well-known figure, known as &quot;Colonel Motor(s)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;{{RP|117}} At the invitation of the publisher [[Plon (publisher)|Plon]], he produced another book, ''La France et son Armée (France and Her Army)'' in 1938. De Gaulle incorporated much of the text he had written for Pétain a decade earlier for the uncompleted book ''Le Soldat'', to Pétain's displeasure. In the end, de Gaulle agreed to include a dedication to Pétain (although he wrote his own rather than using the draft Pétain sent him), which was later dropped from postwar editions. Until 1938 Pétain had treated de Gaulle, as Lacouture puts it, &quot;with unbounded good will&quot;, but by October 1938 he privately thought his former protégé &quot;an ambitious man, and very ill-bred&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp157-65, 213–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War: the Fall of France==
===Early war===
At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle was put in command of the French [[Fifth Army (France)|Fifth Army]]'s tanks (five scattered battalions, largely equipped with [[Renault R35|R35 light tanks]]) in Alsace. On 12 September 1939 he attacked at [[Bitche]], simultaneously with the [[Saar Offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p149, 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;{{RP|118}}

At the start of October 1939 Reynaud asked for a staff posting under de Gaulle, but in the event remained at his post as Minister of Finance. De Gaulle's tanks were inspected by [[Albert Lebrun|President Lebrun]], who was impressed, but regretted that it was too late to implement his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p170&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a paper ''L'Avènement de la force mécanique (The coming of the Armoured Force)'' which he sent to [[Alphonse Joseph Georges|General Georges]] (commander-in-chief on the northeast front – who was not especially impressed) and the politician [[Leon Blum]]. Daladier, Prime Minister at the time, was too busy to read it.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p171&lt;/ref&gt;

In late-February 1940, Reynaud told de Gaulle that he had been earmarked for command of an armoured division as soon as one became available.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp174-5&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1940 (the exact date is uncertain) de Gaulle proposed to Reynaud that he be appointed Secretary-General of the War Council, which would in effect have made him the government's military adviser. When Reynaud became prime minister in March he was reliant on Daladier's backing, so the job went instead to the politician [[Paul Baudouin]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p175&lt;/ref&gt;

In late-March de Gaulle was told by Reynaud that he would be given command of the [[4e Division cuirassée|4th Armoured Division]], due to form by 15 May.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p177&lt;/ref&gt; The government appeared likely to be restructured, as Daladier and [[Maurice Gamelin]] (commander-in-chief) were under attack in the aftermath of the [[Norwegian Campaign|Allied defeat in Norway]], and had this happened de Gaulle, who on 3 May was still lobbying Reynaud for a restructuring of the control of the war, might well have joined the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p178&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, p178&lt;/ref&gt; By 7 May he was assembling the staff of his new division.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, pp180-1&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp180-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of France: division commander===
{{Main|Battle of France}}
The Germans [[Manstein Plan|attacked the West on 10 May]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p178&quot;/&gt; De Gaulle activated his new division on 12 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, pp180-1&quot;/&gt; The Germans broke through at [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|Sedan]] on 15 May 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Brad DeLong|title=Charles de Gaulle|url=http://econ161.berkeley.edu/TCEH/charlesdegaulle.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107012026/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/TCEH/charlesdegaulle.html|archivedate=7 January 2006|publisher=University of California at Berkeley|date=29 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day, with three tank battalions assembled, less than a third of his paper strength, he was summoned to headquarters and told to attack to gain time for General Robert Touchon's [[Sixth Army (France)|Sixth Army]] to redeploy from the Maginot Line to the Aisne. General Georges told him it was his chance to implement his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p180-2&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|time19590105}}

De Gaulle commandeered some retreating cavalry and artillery units and also received an extra half-brigade, one of whose battalions included some heavy [[Char B1 bis|B1 bis]] tanks. The attack at [[Battle of Montcornet|Montcornet]], a key road junction near Laon, began around 04:30 on 17 May. Outnumbered and without air support, he lost 23 of his 90 vehicles to mines, anti-tank weapons, or [[Stuka]]s. On 18 May he was reinforced by two fresh regiments of armoured cavalry, bringing his strength up to 150 vehicles. He attacked again on 19 May and his forces were once again devastated by German Stukas and artillery. He ignored orders from General Georges to withdraw, and in the early afternoon demanded two more divisions from Touchon, who refused his request.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p180-3 on pp213-5, in a list of acts of insubordination committed by de Gaulle prior to 18 June 1940, Lacouture mentions a demand on 25 May 1940 that he be given command of an extra two or three divisions to mount a stronger attack. This does not appear in the more detailed narrative and it is not clear whether it is a confusion of the events on 19 May.&lt;/ref&gt; Although de Gaulle's tanks forced the German infantry to retreat to [[Caumont-sur-Durance|Caumont]], the action brought only temporary relief and did little to slow the spearhead of the German advance. Nevertheless, it was one of the few successes the French enjoyed while suffering defeats elsewhere across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ledwidge p. 50-52&quot;&gt;Ledwidge pp. 50–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p180-3&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, p180-3&lt;/ref&gt;

He delayed his retreat until 20 May. On 21 May, at the request of propaganda officers, he gave a talk on French radio about his recent attack.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p183&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition for his efforts de Gaulle was promoted to the rank of temporary ([[Acting (rank)|acting]], in Anglophone parlance) [[Brigade general#France|brigadier-general]] on 23 May 1940. Despite being compulsorily retired as a colonel on 22 June (see below) he would wear the uniform of a brigadier-general for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture writes that after the war he was &quot;mythically a general to all eternity, but legally a retired colonel&quot;. Early in 1946, just after his departure from office, War Minister [[Edmond Michelet]] wrote to him that Prime Minister [[Félix Gouin]] wanted his rank to be as high as possible (which Lacouture takes to mean Marshal of France). De Gaulle wrote back that it was &quot;impossible to regulate a situation absolutely without precedent,&quot; that the situation had continued for 5 years 7 months and 3 days and that it would be &quot;strange, even ridiculous&quot; to rectify his rank for administrative reasons now. As the royalties for his War Memoirs were paid to the Anne-de-Gaulle foundation, he and his wife had to live off his pension as a retired colonel in the 1950s. His wife was reduced to selling family silverware to help make ends meet.[Lacouture Vol 2, p128, pp156-7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p180-3&quot;/&gt;

On 28–29 May, de Gaulle attacked the German bridgehead south of the Somme at [[Battle of Abbeville|Abbeville]], taking around 400 German prisoners in the last attempt to cut an escape route for the Allied forces falling back on Dunkirk.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;{{RP|127}}

The future General Paul Huard, who served under de Gaulle at this time, recorded how he would often stand on a piece of high ground, keeping other officers literally at six yards' distance, subjecting his subordinates to harsh criticism and making all decisions autocratically himself, behaviour consistent with his later conduct as a political leader. Lacouture points out that for all his undoubted energy and physical courage there is no evidence in his brief period of command that he possessed the &quot;hunter's eye&quot; of the great battlefield commander, and that not a single one of his officers joined him in London, although some joined the Resistance in France.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p186&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle's rank of brigadier-general became effective on 1 June 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;{{RP|127}} That day he was in Paris. After a visit to his tailor to be fitted for his general's uniform, he visited Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time, and later afterwards the commander-in-chief [[Maxime Weygand]], who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p187&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, p187&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June he sent a memo to Weygand vainly urging that the French armoured divisions be consolidated from four weak divisions into three stronger ones and concentrated into an armoured [[corps]] under his command. He made the same suggestion to Reynaud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p187&quot;/&gt;

===Battle of France: government minister===
On 5 June, the day the Germans began the second phase of their offensive ''([[Fall Rot]])'', Prime Minister Paul Reynaud appointed de Gaulle a government minister, as Under-Secretary of State for [[Minister of Defence (France)|National Defence and War]], with particular responsibility for coordination with the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabinet Paul Reynaud|publisher=Assemblée Nationale Française|year=2008|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/gvt3rep.asp#paulreynaud}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weygand objected to the appointment, thinking him &quot;a mere child&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p190&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, p190&lt;/ref&gt; Pétain (Deputy Prime Minister) was also displeased at his appointment and told Reynaud the story of the ghost-writing of ''Le Soldat''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p190&quot;/&gt; His appointment received a good deal of press attention, both in France and in the UK. He asked for an English-speaking aide and [[Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel]] was given the job.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p191&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June, de Gaulle visited Weygand, who believed it was &quot;the end&quot; and that after France was defeated Britain would also soon sue for peace. He hoped that after an armistice the Germans would allow him to retain enough of a French Army to &quot;maintain order&quot; in France. He gave a &quot;despairing laugh&quot; when de Gaulle suggested fighting on.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p193. Weygand later disputed the accuracy of de Gaulle's account of this conversation, and remarked on its similarity to a dialogue by [[Pierre Corneille]]. Lacouture suggests that de Gaulle's account is consistent with other evidence of Weygand's beliefs at the time and is therefore, allowing perhaps for a little literary embellishment, broadly plausible.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June, de Gaulle flew to London and met British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] for the first time. It was thought that half a million men could be evacuated to [[French North Africa]], provided the British and French navies and air forces coordinated their efforts. Either at this meeting or on 16 June he urged Churchill in vain to throw more [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft into the Battle of France, but conceded there and then that Churchill was right to refuse.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p194&lt;/ref&gt;

In his memoirs, de Gaulle mentioned his support for the proposal to continue the war from French North Africa, but at the time he was more in favour of the plan to form a &quot;[[National redoubt|redoubt]]&quot; in Brittany than he later admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p189&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy entered the war on 10 June. That day de Gaulle was present at two meetings with Weygand (he only mentions one in his memoirs), one at the defence committee and a second where Weygand barged into Reynaud's office and demanded an armistice. When Weygand asked de Gaulle, who wanted to carry on fighting, if he had &quot;anything to suggest&quot;, de Gaulle replied that it was the government's job to give orders, not to make suggestions. De Gaulle wanted Paris to be stubbornly defended by [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|de Lattre]], but instead it was declared an [[open city]]. At around 23:00 Reynaud and de Gaulle left Paris for Tours; the rest of the government left Paris on 11 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, pp195-6&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp195-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of France: Briare and Tours===
On 11 June de Gaulle drove to Arcis-sur-Aube and offered General [[Charles Huntziger|Hunziger]] (Commander of the Central Army Group) Weygand's job as Commander-in-Chief. Hunziger accepted in principle (although according to Henri Massis he was merely amused at the prospect of forming a Breton redoubt – Hunziger would sign the armistice on behalf of Pétain a few weeks later) but de Gaulle was unable to persuade Reynaud to sack Weygand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, pp195-6&quot;/&gt;

Later on 11 June de Gaulle attended the meeting of the [[Anglo-French Supreme War Council]] at the Chateau du Muguet at [[Briare]]. The British were represented by Churchill, [[Anthony Eden]], [[John Dill]], [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]] and [[Edward Spears]], and the French by Reynaud, Pétain, Weygand, and Georges. Churchill demanded that the French take to guerrilla warfare, and reminded Pétain of how he had come to the aid of the British with forty divisions in [[Spring Offensive|March 1918]], receiving a dusty answer in each case. De Gaulle's fighting spirit made a strong impression on the British. At the meeting de Gaulle met Pétain for the first time in two years. Pétain noted his recent promotion to general, adding that he did not congratulate him, as ranks were of no use in defeat. When de Gaulle protested that Pétain himself had been promoted to brigadier-general and division commander at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914, he replied that there was &quot;no comparison&quot; with the present situation. De Gaulle later conceded that Pétain was right about that much at least.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p197&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle missed the second day of the conference as he was in [[Rennes]] for a meeting (not mentioned in his memoirs) to discuss the plans for the Breton redoubt with General [[René Altmayer]]. He then returned to attend a cabinet meeting, at which it was clear that there was a growing movement for an armistice, and which decided that the government should move to [[Bordeaux]] rather than de Gaulle's preference for [[Quimper]] in Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p198&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 June de Gaulle attended another Anglo-French conference at Tours with Churchill, [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], Spears, Ismay, and [[Alexander Cadogan]]. This time few other major French figures were present apart from Reynaud and Baudoin. He was an hour late, and his account is not reliable. Reynaud demanded that France be released from the agreement which he had made with Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] in March 1940, so that France could seek an armistice. De Gaulle wrote that Churchill was sympathetic to France seeking an armistice, provided that an agreement was reached about what was to happen to the French fleet. This claim was later made by apologists for the Vichy Regime, e.g., General Georges, who claimed that Churchill had supported the armistice as a means of keeping the Germans out of French North Africa. However, is not supported by other eyewitnesses (Churchill himself, [[Roland de Margerie]], Spears) who agree that Churchill said that he &quot;understood&quot; the French action but that he did ''not'' agree with it. He murmured at de Gaulle that he was ''&quot;l’homme du destin (the man of destiny)&quot;'', although it is unclear whether de Gaulle actually heard him.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp198-200, 238&lt;/ref&gt; At the cabinet meeting that evening Pétain strongly supported Weygand's demand for an armistice, and said that he himself would remain in France to share the suffering of the French people and to begin the national rebirth. De Gaulle was dissuaded from resigning by the Interior Minister [[Georges Mandel]], who argued that the war was only just beginning, and that de Gaulle needed to keep his reputation unsullied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p201&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, p201&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of France: Franco-British Union===
De Gaulle arrived at Bordeaux on 14 June, and was given a new mission to go to [[London]] to discuss the potential evacuation to North Africa. He had a brief meeting with [[Francois Darlan|Admiral Darlan]] about the potential role of the [[French Navy]]. That evening, by coincidence, he dined in the same restaurant as Pétain: he went over to shake his hand in silence, the last time they ever met. Next morning no aircraft could be found so he had to drive to [[Brittany]], where he visited his wife and daughters, and his aged mother (whom he never saw again, as she died in July), before taking a boat to [[Plymouth]] (he asked the skipper if he would be willing to carry on the war under the [[flag of the United Kingdom|British flag]]), where he arrived on 16 June. He ordered the boat ''Pasteur'', with a cargo of munitions, to be diverted to a British port, which caused some members of the French Government to call for him to be put on trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p201&quot;/&gt;

On the afternoon of Sunday 16 June de Gaulle was at [[10 Downing Street]] for talks about [[Jean Monnet]]'s mooted [[Franco-British Union#World War II (1940)|Anglo-French political union]]. He telephoned Reynaud – they were cut off during the conversation and had to resume later – with the news that the British had agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp203-4&lt;/ref&gt; He took off from London on a British aircraft at 18:30 on 16 June (it is unclear whether, as was later claimed, he and Churchill agreed that he would be returning soon), landing at Bordeaux at around 22:00 to be told that he was no longer a minister, as Reynaud had resigned as prime minister after the Franco-British Union had been rejected by his cabinet. Pétain had become prime minister with a remit of seeking an [[armistice]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. De Gaulle was now in imminent danger of arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp202-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight with Edward Spears===
De Gaulle visited Reynaud, who still hoped to escape to French North Africa and declined to come to London. Reynaud still had control of secret government funds until the handover of power the next day. It has been suggested that he ordered de Gaulle to go to London, but no written evidence has ever been found to confirm this. Georges Mandel also refused to come.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p209-11&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 09:00 on the morning of 17 June he flew to London on a British aircraft with [[Edward Spears]]. The escape was hair-raising. Spears claimed that de Gaulle had been reluctant to come, and that he had pulled him into the aircraft at the last minute, although de Gaulle's biographer does not accept this. Jean Laurent brought 100,000 gold francs in secret funds provided to him by Reynaud. De Gaulle later told [[André Malraux]] of the mental anguish which his flight to London – a break with the French Army and with the recognised government, which would inevitably be seen as treason by many – had caused him.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p211-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal from London===
[[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|General de Gaulle speaking on [[BBC Radio]] during the war]]
[[File:De Gaulle - à tous les Français.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|&quot;To all Frenchmen&quot;: de Gaulle exhorting the French to resist the German occupation]]
[[File:De Gaulle speech plaque in Arc de Triomphe.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|De Gaulle speech plaque in Arc de Triomphe]]

De Gaulle landed at [[Heston Airport]] soon after 12:30 on 17 June 1940. He saw Churchill at around 15:00 and Churchill offered him broadcast time on BBC. They both knew about Pétain's broadcast earlier that day that stated that &quot;the fighting must end&quot; and that he had approached the Germans for terms. That evening de Gaulle dined with Jean Monnet and denounced Pétain's &quot;treason&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 2019, p 125-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day the British Cabinet (Churchill was not present, as it was the day of his [[This was their finest hour|&quot;Finest Hour&quot; speech]]) were reluctant to agree to de Gaulle giving a radio address, as Britain was still in communication with the Pétain government about the fate of the French fleet. [[Duff Cooper]] (Minister of Information) had an advance copy of the text of the address, to which there were no objections. The cabinet eventually agreed after individual lobbying, as indicated by a handwritten amendment to the cabinet minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp221-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CDG&quot;/&gt;

De Gaulle's ''[[Appeal of 18 June]]'' exhorted the French people not to be demoralized and to continue to resist the occupation of France. He also – apparently on his own initiative – declared that he would broadcast again the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p208&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, p208&lt;/ref&gt; No recording survives of the 18 June speech. Few listened to it, although it was published in some newspapers in metropolitan (mainland) France. The speech was largely aimed at French soldiers who were then in Britain after being evacuated from [[Norwegian campaign|Norway]] and [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]; most showed no interest in fighting for de Gaulle's [[Free French Forces]] and were repatriated back to France to become German prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p226&lt;/ref&gt;

In his next broadcast on 19 June de Gaulle denied the legitimacy of the government at Bordeaux.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p208&quot;/&gt; He called on the North African troops to live up to the tradition of [[Bertrand Clausel]], [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]], and [[Hubert Lyautey]] by defying orders from Bordeaux. The British Foreign Office protested to Churchill.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p228&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle also tried, largely in vain, to attract the support of French forces in the French Empire. He telegraphed to General [[Charles Noguès]] (Resident-General in Morocco and Commander-in-Chief of French forces in North Africa), offering to serve under him or to cooperate in any way. Noguès, who was dismayed by the armistice but agreed to go along with it, refused to cooperate and forbade the press in French North Africa to publish de Gaulle's appeal. Noguès told the British liaison officer that de Gaulle's attitude was &quot;unseemly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp229-30&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle also sent a telegram to Weygand offering to serve under his orders, receiving a dismissive reply.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p230&lt;/ref&gt;

After the armistice was signed on 21 June 1940, de Gaulle spoke at 20:00 on 22 June to denounce it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p236&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, p236&lt;/ref&gt; The Bordeaux government declared him compulsorily retired from the French Army (with the rank of colonel) on 23 June 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1:243-4&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1:243-4&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June the British Government denounced the armistice as a breach of the Anglo-French treaty signed in March, and stated that they no longer regarded the Bordeaux Government as a fully independent state. They also &quot;took note&quot; of the plan to establish a French National Committee ''(FNC)'' in exile, but did not mention de Gaulle by name. Jean Monnet broke with de Gaulle on 23 June, as he thought his appeal was &quot;too personal&quot; and went too far, and that French opinion would not rally to a man who was seen to be operating from British soil. He said he had warned the Foreign Office officials Alexander Cadogan and [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]], as well as Edward Spears, of his concerns about de Gaulle. Monnet soon resigned as head of the Inter-Allied Commission and departed for the US. De Gaulle broadcast again on 24 June.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp236-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leader of the Free French===
The armistice took effect from 00:35 on 25 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p236&quot;/&gt; Alexander Cadogan of the foreign office sent [[Gladwyn Jebb]], then a fairly junior official, to ask de Gaulle to tone down his next broadcast on 26 June; de Gaulle backed down under protest when Jebb told him that he would otherwise be banned from broadcasting. He claimed erroneously that the French fleet was to be handed over to the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p248-51&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June de Gaulle wrote to Churchill demanding recognition of his French Committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p208&quot;/&gt; On 28 June, after Churchill's envoys had failed to establish contact with the French leaders in North Africa, the British Government recognised de Gaulle as leader of the Free French, despite the reservations of Halifax and Cadogan at the foreign office.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p243&lt;/ref&gt; Cadogan later wrote that de Gaulle was &quot;that c*** of a fellow&quot;, but other foreign office figures [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]] and [[Oliver Harvey, 1st Baron Harvey of Tasburgh|Oliver Harvey]] were quite sympathetic, as was ''The Times'' which gave de Gaulle plenty of coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p249-50&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle had little success in attracting the support of major figures. Ambassador [[Charles Corbin]], who had strongly supported the mooted Anglo-French Union on 16 June, resigned from the French Foreign Office but retired to South America. [[Alexis Leger]], Secretary-General at the [[Quai d'Orsay]] (who hated Reynaud for sacking him) came to London but went on to the US. Roland de Margerie stayed in France despite his opposition to the armistice. De Gaulle received support from Captain Tissier and [[André Dewavrin]] (both of whom had been fighting in Norway prior to joining the Free French), [[Gaston Palewski]], [[Maurice Schumann]], and the jurist [[René Cassin]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p239&lt;/ref&gt;

Pétain's government was recognised by the US, the USSR, and the Papacy, and controlled the French fleet and the forces in almost all her colonies. At this time de Gaulle's followers consisted of a secretary of limited competence, three colonels, a dozen captains, a famous law professor (Cassin), and three battalions of [[French Foreign Legion|legionnaires]] who had agreed to stay in Britain and fight for him. For a time the [[New Hebrides]] were the only French colony to back de Gaulle.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p244&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 1940 [[Émile Muselier|Admiral Muselier]] joined the Free French.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p263&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, p263&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle initially reacted angrily to news of the Royal Navy's [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir|attack on the French fleet]] (3 July); Pétain and others wrongly blamed him for provoking it by his 26 June speech (in fact it had been planned at least as early as 16 June). He considered withdrawing to Canada to live as a private citizen and waited five days before broadcasting. Spears called on de Gaulle on 5 July and found him &quot;astonishingly objective&quot; and acknowledging that it was the right thing from the British point of view. Spears reported to Churchill that de Gaulle had shown &quot;a splendid dignity&quot;. In his broadcast of 8 July he spoke of the &quot;pain and anger&quot; caused by the attack and that it was a &quot;hateful tragedy not a glorious battle&quot;, but that one day the enemy would have used the ships against England or the French Empire, and that the defeat of England would mean &quot;bondage forever&quot; for France. &quot;Our two ancient nations...remain bound to one another. They will either go down both together or both together they will win&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p248-9&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Bastille Day]] (14 July) 1940 de Gaulle led a group of between 200 and 300 sailors to lay a wreath at the statue of [[Ferdinand Foch]] at Grosvenor Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p260&lt;/ref&gt; A mass of anonymous flowers were left on his mother's grave on 16 July 1940, suggesting he was not without admirers in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p256&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, p256&lt;/ref&gt;

From 22 July 1940 de Gaulle used [[Carlton House Terrace|4 Carlton Gardens]] in [[central London]] as his London headquarters. His family had left Brittany (the other ship which left at the same time was sunk) and lived for a time at [[Petts Wood]]. As his daughter Anne was terrified by the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] they moved to [[Ellesmere, Shropshire|Ellesmere]] in Shropshire, a four-hour journey from London and where de Gaulle was only able to visit them once a month. His wife and daughter also lived for a time in the country at Rodinghead House, [[Little Gaddesden]], in Hertfordshire, 45 kilometres (28 miles) from central London. De Gaulle lived at the [[Connaught Hotel]] in London, then from 1942 to 1944 he lived in [[Hampstead]], North London.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1:257–58&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vichy regime had already sentenced de Gaulle to four years' imprisonment; on 2 August 1940 he was condemned to death by court martial ''in absentia'', although Pétain commented that he would ensure that the sentence was never carried out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1:243-4&quot;/&gt; De Gaulle said of the sentence, &quot;I consider the act of the Vichy men as void; I shall have an explanation with them after the victory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sptimes19400803&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dk8wAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3148%2C219080 | title=French Take Part in Air Raids | work=St. Petersburg Times | date=1940-08-03 | accessdate=2018-08-09 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Churchill reached agreement on 7 August 1940, that Britain would fund the Free French, with the bill to be settled after the war (the financial agreement was finalised in March 1941). A separate letter guaranteed the territorial integrity of the French Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p261-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De_Gaulle_Brazzaville_1944.jpg|thumb|190px|De Gaulle at the inauguration of the [[Brazzaville]] Conference, [[French Equatorial Africa]], 1944]]

General [[Georges Catroux]], Governor of [[French Indo-China]] (which was increasingly coming under Japan's thumb), disapproved of the armistice and congratulated de Gaulle, whom he had known for many years. He was sacked by Vichy and arrived in London on 31 August; de Gaulle had gone to Dakar, but they met in [[Chad]] four weeks later. He was the most senior military figure to defect to the Free French.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p263&quot;/&gt;

De Gaulle's support grew out of a base in colonial Africa. In the fall of 1940, the colonial empire largely supported the Vichy regime. [[Félix Éboué]], governor of Chad, switched his support to General de Gaulle in September. Encouraged, de Gaulle traveled to Brazzaville in October, where he announced the formation of an [[Empire Defense Council]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Shillington-2013&quot; /&gt; in his &quot;Brazzaville Manifesto&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brazzaville-1940&quot;&gt;{{cite book  |author=France libre  |title=Documents officiels. &amp;#91;Manifeste du 27 octobre 1940, à Brazzaville.

In October 1940, after talks between the foreign office and [[Louis Rougier]], de Gaulle was asked to tone down his attacks on Pétain. On average he spoke on BBC radio three times a month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p250-1&quot;&gt;Lacouture 1991, p250-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Gaulle and Pétain: rival visions of France===
Prime Minister Pétain moved the government to Vichy (2 July) and had the National Assembly (10 July) vote to dissolve itself and give him dictatorial powers, making the beginning of his ''Révolution nationale'' (National Revolution) intended to &quot;reorient&quot; French society. This was the dawn of the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1:243-4&quot;/&gt;

De Gaulle's subsequent speeches reached many parts of the territories under the Vichy regime, helping to rally the French resistance movement and earning him much popularity amongst the French people and soldiers. The British historian Christopher Flood noted that there were major differences between the speeches of de Gaulle and Pétain, which reflected their views on themselves and of France. Pétain always used the personal pronoun ''je'', portrayed himself as both a Christ-like figure sacrificing himself for France while also assuming a God-like tone of a semi-omniscient narrator who knew truths about the world that the rest of the French did not.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolmanKelly-2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flood|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Holman|editor1-first=Valerie|editor2-last=Kelly|editor2-first=Debra|title=France at War in the Twentieth Century; Propaganda, Myth, and Metaphor|date=2000|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=9781571817013|pages=88–110|chapter-url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HolmanFrance|accessdate=19 November 2017|chapter=Pétain and de Gaulle}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle began by making frequent use of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; in his war-time speeches, but over time, their use declined. Unlike Pétain, de Gaulle never invoked quasi-religious imagery to enhance his prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolmanKelly-2000&quot; /&gt; De Gaulle always mentioned Pétain by name whereas Pétain never mentioned de Gaulle directly, referring to him as the &quot;''faux ami''&quot; (&quot;false friend&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;HolmanKelly-2000&quot; /&gt;

Pétain exonerated the French military of responsibility for the defeat of 1940 which he blamed on the moral decline of French society (thus making his ''Révolution nationale'' necessary) while de Gaulle blamed the military chiefs while exonerating French society for the defeat (thus suggesting that French society was nowhere near as rotten as Pétain claimed, making the ''Révolution nationale'' unnecessary).&lt;ref name=&quot;HolmanKelly-2000&quot; /&gt; Pétain claimed that France had &quot;stupidly&quot; declared war on Germany in 1939 at British prompting while de Gaulle spoke of the entire era since 1914 as &quot;''la guerre de trente ans''&quot; (&quot;the thirty years' war&quot;), arguing the two world wars were really one with a long truce in between.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolmanKelly-2000&quot; /&gt; The only historical figure Pétain invoked was [[Joan of Arc]] as a model of self-sacrificing French patriotism in the &quot;eternal struggle&quot; against England whereas de Gaulle invoked virtually every major French historical figure from the ancient Gauls to World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolmanKelly-2000&quot; /&gt; De Gaulle's willingness to invoke historical figures from before and after 1789 was meant to suggest that his France was an inclusive France where there was room for both left and right, in contrast to Pétain's demand for national unity under his leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolmanKelly-2000&quot; /&gt; Most significantly, Pétain's speeches always stressed the need for France to withdraw from a hostile and threatening world to find unity.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolmanKelly-2000&quot; /&gt; By contrast, de Gaulle's speeches, while praising the greatness of France, lacked Pétain's implicit xenophobia; the fight for a free, democratic and inclusive France was always portrayed as part of a wider worldwide struggle for world freedom, where France would be an anchor for a new democratic order.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolmanKelly-2000&quot; /&gt;

De Gaulle spoke more of &quot;the Republic&quot; than of &quot;democracy&quot;; before his death René Cassin claimed that he had &quot;succeeded in turning de Gaulle towards democracy&quot;. However, claims that de Gaulle was surrounded by [[Cagoulards]], Royalists and other right-wing extremists are untrue. Some of André Dewavrin's closest colleagues were Cagoulards, although Dewavrin always denied that he himself was. Many leading figures of the Free French and the Resistance, e.g., [[Jean Moulin]] and [[Pierre Brossolette]], were on the political left.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p254-5&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1940 de Gaulle was beginning to be recognised as the leader of the Resistance, a position cemented after Jean Moulin's visit to London in autumn 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p256&quot;/&gt; In the summer of 1941 the BBC set aside five minutes per day (later increased to ten) for the Free French, with Maurice Schumann as the main spokesman, and eventually there was a programme &quot;Les Francais parlent aux Francais&quot;. A newspaper ''France'' was also soon set up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacouture 1991, p250-1&quot;/&gt;

De Gaulle organised the Free French Forces and the Allies gave increasing support and recognition to de Gaulle's efforts. In London in September 1941 de Gaulle formed the Free French National Council, with himself as president. It was an all-encompassing coalition of resistance forces, ranging from conservative Catholics like himself to communists. By early 1942, the &quot;Fighting French&quot; movement, as it was now called, gained rapidly in power and influence; it overcame Vichy in Syria and Lebanon, adding to its base. Dealing with the French communists was a delicate issue, for they were under Moscow's control and the USSR was friendly with Germany in 1940–41 as a result of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. They came into the Free French movement only when [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded Russia]] in June 1941. De Gaulle's policy then became one of friendship directly with Moscow, but [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] showed little interest.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1:373, 462&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, de Gaulle created the [[Normandie-Niemen]] squadron, a [[Free French Air Force]] regiment, in order to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. It is the only Western allied formation to have fought until the end of the war in the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bg8drRyDGhEC&amp;pg=PA361|title = 500 Days: The War in Eastern Europe, 1944–1945|isbn=978-1-4349-6159-4|page=361|last1 = McAteer|first1 = Sean M.|year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Gaulle's relations with the ''Anglo-Saxons''===
[[File:Sikorski McNaughton Churchill de Gaulle C064027.jpg|thumb|right|Charles de Gaulle (far right) with [[Andrew McNaughton]], [[Władysław Sikorski]], and [[Winston Churchill]]]]
In his dealings with the British and Americans (both referred to as the &quot;Anglo-Saxons&quot;, in de Gaulle's parlance), he always insisted on retaining full freedom of action on behalf of France and was constantly on the verge of losing the Allies' support. Some writers have sought to deny that there was deep and mutual antipathy between de Gaulle and British and American political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, F. Patrick [http://www.cavortingwithstrangers.com/bookVIII-Gaulle.php ''Cavorting with Strangers'': Book VIII- Charles de Gaulle arrogant autocrat, Chapter 1: Feet of Clay]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article995545.ece|place=London|work=The Times|first=Charles|last=Bremner|title=Did De Gaulle really hate the British Mais non|date=18 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle personally had ambivalent feelings about Britain, possibly in part because of childhood memories of the [[Fashoda Incident]]. As an adult he spoke German much better than he spoke English; he had thought little of the British Army's contribution to the First World War, and even less of that of 1939–40, and in the 1930s he had been a reader of the journal ''[[Action Française]]'' which blamed Britain for German foreign policy gains at France's expense.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p220&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle explained his position:{{quote|Never did the Anglo-Saxons really treat us as real allies. They never consulted us, government to government, on any of their provisions. For political purpose or by convenience, they sought to use the French forces for their own goals, as if these forces belonged to them, alleging that they had provided weapons to them [...] I considered that I had to play the French game, since the others were playing theirs ... I deliberately adopted a stiffened and hardened attitude ....&lt;ref&gt;[[Le Monde diplomatique]], &quot;Les relations entre Roosevelt et Charles de Gaulle&quot;, 1956 [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1956/08/JULIEN/21868]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, de Gaulle harboured a suspicion of the British in particular, believing that they were seeking to seize France's colonial possessions in the [[Levant]]. Winston Churchill was often frustrated at what he perceived as de Gaulle's patriotic arrogance, but also wrote of his &quot;immense admiration&quot; for him during the early days of his British exile. Although their relationship later became strained, Churchill tried to explain the reasons for de Gaulle's behaviour in the second volume of [[The Second World War (book series)|his history of World War II]]:{{quote|He felt it was essential to his position before the French people that he should maintain a proud and haughty demeanour towards &quot;[[perfidious Albion]]&quot;, although in exile, dependent upon our protection and dwelling in our midst. He had to be rude to the British to prove to French eyes that he was not a British puppet. He certainly carried out this policy with perseverance.}}

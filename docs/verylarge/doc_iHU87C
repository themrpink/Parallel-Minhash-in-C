==Disbandment==
After realizing the huge success of Unit 101, the Chief of Staff, General Moshe Dayan decided that the experience gained by it must be shared with all IDF infantry units starting with the Paratroopers Battalion 890. This was done by merging the two together under the command of Ariel Sharon who was then promoted to the rank of Lt. Colonel. After the merger and the addition of a NACHAL MUTZNACH battalion, the combined outfit turned into a brigade size unit, named Brigade 202. Sharon became the commander of the merged brigade which was now composed of two battalions—890 and 88 and a few months later joined by reserve battalion 771 which included ex-101 members together with reserve paratroopers and NACHAL paratroopers.

The merge with T'zanhanim company{{Clarify|date=October 2015}} was actually ironic since their officers were originally the biggest opposition against the creation of Unit 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;Israeli Special Forces History&quot; /&gt;  This was because they didn't want a competitor for retaliation missions.  Before the formation of Unit 101 only they undertook these missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Israeli Special Forces History&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unit 101 (history) - Specwar.info &quot;/&gt;

Operating within the brigade, they{{Who|date=October 2015}} carried out a large-scale attack on the Egyptian army positions in the Gaza strip during February 1955.  Sharon personally led the raid, codenamed [[Operation Black Arrow]].  It resulted in 42 Egyptian soldiers killed and 36 wounded, versus 8 Israeli dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unit 101 (history) - Specwar.info &quot;/&gt;  The newly formed brigade did most of the Israeli special forces operations during the remainder of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Israeli Special Forces History&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unit 101 (history) - Specwar.info &quot;/&gt;

Egyptian shock over the magnitude of their losses is often cited as one of the catalysts for the Soviet-Egyptian arms deal that opened the Middle East to the [[Soviet Union]].  Up to 20 such attacks were carried out between 1955 and 1956, culminating in the [[Qalqilya|Qalqilya Police raid]] of October 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unit 101 (history) - Specwar.info &quot;/&gt;  This particular raid targeted a position of the Jordanian [[Arab Legion]] in one of the old [[Mandatory Palestine|British]] police forts, during which 18 Israeli soldiers and up to a hundred Legionnaires were killed.

During the end of the 1950s the IDF realized that they were lacking a small SF unit, since the T'zanhanim company had turned into an infantry brigade. That is the main reason why Avraham Arnan formed the [[Sayeret Matkal]] in 1958.  In various ways the Sayeret Matkal combined the operational experience gathered by Unit 101 and utilised the structure of the British [[Special Air Service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The secret remains&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1019894.html|title=The secret remains&amp;nbsp;– Haaretz&amp;nbsp;– Israel News|last=Reicher-Atir |first=Yiftach|date=September 2008|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After losing their special forces title, the T'zanhanim company formed its own SF unit—the [[Sayeret T'zanhanim]] in October 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unit 101 (history) - Specwar.info &quot;/&gt;

[[File:Johann Otto von Gemmingen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Johann Otto von Gemmingen]], Prince-Bishop of [[Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg|Augsburg]] (1591–1598)]]
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
A '''prince-bishop''' is a [[bishop]] who is also the civil ruler of some [[Secularity|secular]] principality and [[sovereignty]]. Thus the principality or '''[[Hochstift|prince-bishopric]]''' ruled politically by a prince-bishop could wholly or largely overlap with his diocesan jurisdiction, but some parts of his [[diocese]], even the city of his residence, could be exempt from his civil rule, obtaining the status of [[free imperial city]]. If the [[episcopal see]] is an [[archbishop]], the correct term is '''prince-archbishop'''; the equivalent in the regular (monastic) clergy is [[prince-abbot]]. A prince-bishop is usually considered an [[elective monarchy|elected monarch]].

In the West, with the decline of [[Roman Empire|imperial power]] from the 4th century onwards in the face of the [[barbarian]] invasions, sometimes [[Christianity|Christian]] bishops of [[city|cities]] took the place of the Roman commander, made secular decisions for the city and led their own troops when necessary. Later relations between a prince-bishop and the [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] were invariably not cordial. As cities demanded charters from emperors, kings, or their prince-bishops and declared themselves independent of the secular territorial magnates, friction intensified between burghers and bishops.

In the [[Byzantine Empire]], the still [[autocratic]] Emperors passed general legal measures assigning all bishops certain rights and duties in the secular administration of their dioceses, possibly as part of a development to put the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Church]] in the service of the Empire{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}, with its [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] almost reduced to the Emperor's minister of religious affairs.

Bishops had been involved in the government of the Frankish realm and subsequent [[Carolingian Empire]] frequently as the clerical member of a duo of envoys styled {{lang|la|[[Missus dominicus]]}}, but that was an individual mandate, not attached to the see. Prince-bishoprics were most common in the feudally fragmented [[Holy Roman Empire]], where many were formally awarded the rank of an [[Prince of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Prince]] {{lang|de|[[Reichsfürst]]}}, granting them the [[imperial immediacy|immediate]] power over a certain territory and a representation in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] ({{lang|de|Reichstag}}).

The [[stem duchy|stem duchies]] of the [[Kingdom of Germany|German kingdom]] inside the Empire had strong and powerful [[duke]]s (originally, war-rulers), always looking out more for their [[duchy]]'s &quot;[[national interest]]&quot; than for the Empire's. In turn the first [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] ([[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]]) king [[Henry the Fowler]] and more so his son, Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], intended to weaken the power of the dukes by granting loyal bishops Imperial lands and vest them with {{lang|la|[[regalia]]}} privileges. Unlike dukes they could not pass hereditary titles and lands to any descendants. Instead the Emperors reserved the implementation of the bishops of their [[proprietary church]] for themselves, defying the fact that according to [[canon law]] they were part of the transnational [[Catholic Church]]. This met with increasing opposition by the [[Pope]]s, culminating in the fierce [[Investiture Controversy]] of 1076. Nevertheless, the Emperors continued to grant major territories to the most important (arch)bishops. The immediate territory attached to the episcopal see then became a prince-diocese or bishopric ({{lang|de|Fürstbistum}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Joachim Fernau: 'Deutschland, Deutschland über alles — Geschichte der Deutschen'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German term {{lang|de|[[Hochstift]]}} was often used to denote the form of secular authority held by bishops ruling a prince-bishopric with {{lang|de|Erzstift}} being used for prince-archbishoprics.

Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]] confirmed the privileged status of the Prince-Archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]] and [[Electorate of Trier|Trier]] as members of the [[Prince-elector|electoral]] college. At the eve of the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Imperial state]]s comprised 53 ecclesiastical principalities. They were finally secularized in the 1803 [[German Mediatization]] upon the territorial losses to [[French First Republic|France]] in the [[Treaty of Lunéville]], except for the Mainz prince-archbishop and German archchancellor [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]], who continued to rule as [[Principality of Aschaffenburg|Prince of Aschaffenburg]] and [[Principality of Regensburg|Regensburg]]. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the title finally became defunct. However, in some countries outside of French control, such as in the [[Austrian Empire]] ([[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Salzburg|Salzburg]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Graz-Seckau|Seckau]], and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Olomouc|Olomouc]]) and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] ([[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wrocław|Breslau]]), the institution nominally continued, and in some cases was revived; a new, titular type arose.

No less than three of the (originally only seven) [[prince-elector]]s, the highest order of {{lang|de|[[Reichsfürst]]en}} (comparable in rank with the French [[pairie|pairs]]), were prince-archbishops, each holding the title of [[Archchancellor]] (the only arch-office amongst them) for a part of the Empire; given the higher importance of an electorate, their principalities were known as {{lang|de|Kurfürstentum}} (&quot;electoral principality&quot;) rather than prince-archbishoprics:

==State of the Teutonic Order==
[[File:Teutonic Order 1466.png|thumb|Order's State in 1466: Livonian episcopal territories in violet, Prince-Bishopric of Warmia in cyan]]
Upon the incorporation of the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] in 1237, the territory of the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Order's State]] largely corresponded with the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Riga|Diocese of Riga]]. Bishop [[Albert of Riga]] in 1207 had received the lands of [[Livonia]] as an Imperial fief from the hands of German king [[Philip of Swabia]], he however had to come to terms with the Brothers of the Sword. At the behest of [[Pope Innocent III]] the ''[[Terra Mariana]]'' confederation was established, whereby Albert had to cede large parts of the episcopal territory to the [[Livonian Order]]. Albert proceeded tactically in the conflict between the Papacy and Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]: in 1225 he reached the acknowledgement of his status as a Prince-Bishop of the Empire, though the [[Roman Curia]] insisted on the fact that the Christianized [[Baltic region|Baltic]] territories were solely under the suzerainty of the [[Holy See]]. By the 1234 Bull of Rieti, [[Pope Gregory IX]] stated that all lands acquired by the Teutonic Knights were no subject of any [[conveyancing]] by the Emperor.

Within this larger conflict, the continued dualism of the autonomous Riga prince-bishop and the [[Teutonic Knights]] led to a lengthy friction. Around 1245 the Papal legate [[William of Modena]] reached a compromise: though incorporated into the Order's State, the archdiocese and its suffragan bishoprics were acknowledged with their autonomous ecclesiastical territories by the Teutonic Knights. The bishops pursued the conferment of the princely title by the Holy Roman Emperor to stress their sovereignty. In the original [[Prussia (region)|Prussian]] lands of the Teutonic Order, Willam of Modena established the suffragan bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Culm (Chełmno)|Culm]], [[Bishopric of Pomesania|Pomesania]], [[Bishopric of Samland|Samland]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Warmia|Warmia]]. From the late 13th century onwards, the appointed Warmia bishops were no longer members of the Teutonic Knights, a special status confirmed by the bestowal of the princely title by Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1356.

== Elsewhere ==

=== England ===
The [[Bishop of Durham|Bishops of Durham]] were also territorial prince-bishops, with the extraordinary secular rank of [[County palatine|Earl palatine]], for it was their duty not only to be head of the large diocese, but also to help protect the Kingdom against the [[Scotland|Scottish]] threat from the north. The title survived the union of England and Scotland into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707 until 1836. The first Prince-bishop was [[William Walcher]] who purchased the earldom and constructed additional buildings of [[Durham Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/castle|title=Durham Castle|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=29 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for a brief period of suppression during the [[English Civil War]], the bishopric retained this temporal power until it was abolished by the [[Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836]] with the powers returned to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1836 |title=The Statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFk0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=bishop+of+durham+++temporal+Powers+by+Palatine++Act+1836#q=bishop%20of%20durham%20%20%20temporal%20Powers%20by%20Palatine%20%20Act%201836 |location= |publisher=His Majesty's Statute and Law Printers|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
Apart from territories formerly within the Holy Roman Empire, no [[France|French]] diocese had a principality of political significance linked to its see.

However, a number of French bishops did hold a noble title, with a tiny territory usually about their seat; it was often a [[prince]]ly title, especially Count. Indeed, six of the twelve original [[Pairie]]s (the royal vassals awarded with the highest precedence at Court) were episcopal: the [[Archbishop of Reims]], the [[Bishop of Langres]], and the [[Bishop of Laon]] held a [[Duke|ducal]] title, the bishops of [[Bishop of Beauvais|Beauvais]], [[Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne|Chalôns]], and [[Bishop of Noyon|Noyon]] had [[Count|comital]] status.

They were later joined by the [[Archbishop of Paris]], who was awarded a ducal title, but with precedence over the others.

=== Montenegro ===
{{further|Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro}}
The [[eparchy of Cetinje|bishops of Cetinje]], [[Montenegro]], who took the place of the earlier secular (Grand) [[Voivode]]s in 1516 had a unique position of [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] prince-bishops of [[History of Ottoman Montenegro|Montenegro]] under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] suzerainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|sr-Latn|[[Sima Milutinović Sarajlija]]}}: [http://www.njegos.org/past/sarajlija.htm#_Toc483545799 ''MONTENEGRO lead by its Bishops''] from {{lang|sr|Историја Црне Горе}} (''The History of Montenegro'', 1835) {{in lang|sr}}&lt;/ref&gt; They actually became the secularized, hereditary princes and ultimately [[King of Montenegro|Kings of Montenegro]] in 1852, as reflected in their styles:
* first {{lang|sr-Latn|Vladika i upravitelj Crne Gore i Brda}} (&quot;Bishop and Ruler of Montenegro and the Highlands&quot;)
* from 13 March 1852 ([[New Style]]): {{lang|sr-Latn|Po milosti Božjoj  knjaz i gospodar Crne Gore i Brda}} (&quot;[[By the grace of God]] Prince and Sovereign of Montenegro and the Highlands&quot;)
* from 28 August 1910 (New Style): {{lang|sr-Latn|Po milosti Božjoj kralj i gospodar Crne Gore}} (&quot;By the grace of God, King and Sovereign of Montenegro&quot;)

=== Portugal ===
From 1472 to 1967, the bishop of [[Coimbra]] held the [[Count|comital]] title of Count of [[Arganil Municipality|Arganil]], being thus called &quot;bishop-count&quot; ({{lang-pt|Bispo-Conde}}). The [[count|comital]] title is still held ''de jure'', but since [[Portugal]] is a republic and nobility privileges are abolished, its use declined during the 20th century.

== Special cases ==
The [[Bishop of Urgell]], Catalonia, who no longer has any secular rights in Spain, remains one of two [[co-princes of Andorra]], along with the French head of state (currently its [[President of the French Republic|President]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andorramania.com/constit_gb.htm|title=The constitution of the Principality of Andorra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://royalcentral.co.uk/features/why-is-the-president-of-france-co-prince-of-andorra-130690/ |title=Why is the President of France Co-Prince of Andorra? |date=7 October 2019 |publisher=Royal Central |access-date=9 November 2019 |quote=The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, serves as Co-Prince of Andorra in addition to his duties as French President and is one of the few examples of a democratically elected leader serving in a royal capacity in another country.

== Modern informal usage ==
The term has been used by Episcopalians in North America to describe modern bishops with commanding personalities usually of previous generations.&lt;ref name=ATVM&gt;{{cite web|title=Duncan's Final Interview as Archbishop|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATPDweJYiL8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PL7p2AAcz9AHhPIOE0_aK0JbpNuzvpEime&amp;t=546|publisher=AnglicanTV Ministries|date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such individual was Bishop [[Horace W. B. Donegan]] of whom Episcopal [[suffragan bishop]] [[Robert E. Terwilliger]] said &quot;We often say that Bishop Donegan is the last prince bishop of the church because in his graciousness, in his presence, in his total lack of any crisis of identity, we have seen what a bishop is; and we know that it is a kind of royalty in Christ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Apostolic Ministry|author=Robert E. Terwilliger|date=1973|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/reterwilliger/apostolic1973.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglican Archbishop [[Robert Duncan (bishop)|Robert Duncan]] expressed his view that the pastoral changes &quot;in the 1970s was a revolution in reaction to those prince bishops - they had all this authority, they had all this power.&quot; So systems such as the Commission on Ministry system in the Episcopal Church &quot;was to replace an individual's authority with a committee's authority.&quot;&lt;ref name=ATVM/&gt;

'''Louis XVI'''  (Louis-Auguste; {{IPA-fr|lwi sɛːz}}; 23 August 1754{{spnd}}21 January 1793) was the last [[king of France]] before the fall of the monarchy during the [[French Revolution]]. He was referred to as ''Citizen Louis Capet'' during the four months just before [[Execution of Louis XVI|he was executed by guillotine]]. In 1765, upon the death of his father, [[Louis, Dauphin of France (son of Louis XV)|Louis, Dauphin of France]], he became the new [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]. Upon his grandfather [[Louis XV]]'s death on 10 May 1774, he assumed the title [[King of France and Navarre]], until 4 September 1791, when he received the title of King of ''[[the French]]'' until the [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|monarchy was abolished]] on 21 September 1792.

The first part of his reign was marked by attempts to reform the French government in accordance with [[Enlightened absolutism|Enlightenment]] ideas. These included efforts to abolish [[serfdom]], remove the ''[[taille]]'' (land tax) and the ''[[corvée]]'' (labour tax),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elvis.rowan.edu/~kilroy/JEK/01/21b.html|title=Louis XVI of France, King and Martyr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increase tolerance toward non-Catholics as well as abolish the death penalty for [[deserters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ib-miw&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berkovich|first1=Ilya|title=Motivation in War|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JzDDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85 |accessdate=11 December 2017|isbn=9781107167735|date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;md-eote&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delon|first1=Michel|title=Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment|page=1246|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEpJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1246 |accessdate=11 December 2017|isbn=9781135959982|date=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French nobility]] reacted to the proposed reforms with hostility, and successfully opposed their implementation. Louis implemented [[deregulation]] of the [[Food grain|grain]] market, advocated by his [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] minister [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot|Turgot]], but it resulted in an increase in bread prices. In periods of bad harvests, it led to food scarcity which, during a particularly bad harvest in 1775, [[Flour War|prompted the masses to revolt]]. From 1776, Louis XVI actively [[France in the American Revolutionary War|supported the North American colonists]], who were seeking their [[American Revolutionary War|independence from Great Britain]], which was realised in the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. The ensuing debt and financial crisis contributed to the unpopularity of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''. This led to the convening of the [[Estates-General of 1789]]. Discontent among the members of France's middle and lower classes resulted in strengthened opposition to the French aristocracy and to the [[absolute monarchy in France|absolute monarchy]], of which Louis and his wife, Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], were viewed as representatives. Increasing tensions and violence were marked by events such as the [[storming of the Bastille]], during which riots in Paris forced Louis to definitively recognize the legislative authority of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]]. 

Louis's indecisiveness and conservatism led some elements of the people of France to view him as a symbol of the perceived tyranny of the ''Ancien Régime'', and his popularity deteriorated progressively. His unsuccessful [[flight to Varennes]] in June 1791, four months before the [[French Constitution of 1791|constitutional monarchy]] was declared, seemed to justify the rumors that the king tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of [[French Revolutionary Wars|foreign intervention]]. The credibility of the king was deeply undermined, and the [[Abolition of monarchy|abolition of the monarchy]] and the establishment of a republic became an ever-increasing possibility. The growth of [[anti-clericalism]] among revolutionaries resulted in the abolition of the ''[[Tithe#France|dîme]]'' (religious land tax) and several government policies aimed at the [[Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution|dechristianization of France]].

In a context of [[War of the First Coalition|civil and international war]], Louis XVI was suspended and arrested at the time of the [[Insurrection of 10 August 1792]]. One month later, the absolute monarchy was abolished and the [[First French Republic]] was proclaimed on 21 September 1792. Louis was then tried by the [[National Convention]] (self-instituted as a tribunal for the occasion), found guilty of [[high treason]], and executed by [[guillotine]] on 21 January 1793, as a [[Desecration|desacralized]] French citizen under the name of ''Citizen Louis Capet'', in reference to [[Hugh Capet]], the founder of the [[Capetian dynasty]] – which the revolutionaries interpreted as Louis's surname. Louis XVI was the only King of France ever to be executed, and his death brought an end to more than a thousand years of continuous French monarchy. Both of his sons died in childhood, before the [[Bourbon Restoration]]; his only child to reach adulthood, [[Marie Thérèse of France|Marie Therese]], was given over to the Austrians in exchange for French prisoners of war, eventually dying childless in 1851.

==Childhood==

[[File:Duc de Berry-Borély.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The duc de Berry as a young boy, artist unknown]]

''Louis-Auguste de France'', who was given the title [[Duc de Berry]] at birth, was born in the [[Palace of Versailles]]. One of seven children, he was the second surviving son of [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis]], the [[Dauphin of France]], and the grandson of [[Louis XV of France]] and of his consort, [[Maria Leszczyńska]]. His mother was [[Maria Josepha of Saxony (1731–1767)|Marie-Josèphe of Saxony]], the daughter of [[August III of Poland|Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]], [[Prince-Elector]] of [[Saxony]] and [[King of Poland]].

Louis-Auguste was overlooked by his parents who favored his older brother, [[Louis of France (1751–1761)|Louis, duc de Bourgogne]], who was regarded as bright and handsome but who died at the age of nine in 1761. Louis-Auguste, a strong and healthy boy but very shy, excelled in his studies and had a strong taste for Latin, history, geography, and astronomy and became fluent in Italian and English. He enjoyed physical activities such as hunting with his grandfather and rough play with his younger brothers, [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis-Stanislas, comte de Provence]], and [[Charles X of France|Charles-Philippe, comte d'Artois]]. From an early age, Louis-Auguste was encouraged in another of his interests, locksmithing, which was seen as a useful pursuit for a child.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David, ''The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France'', Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, 2005, pp. 12–13. {{ISBN|978-0374530730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When his father died of [[tuberculosis]] on 20 December 1765, the eleven-year-old Louis-Auguste became the new [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]. His mother never recovered from the loss of her husband and died on 13 March 1767, also from tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Lever, Évelyne, ''Louis XVI'', Librairie Arthème Fayard, Paris, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The strict and conservative education he received from the [[Paul François de Quelen de la Vauguyon|Duc de La Vauguyon]], &quot;gouverneur des Enfants de France&quot; (governor of the Children of France), from 1760 until his marriage in 1770, did not prepare him for the throne that he was to inherit in 1774 after the death of his grandfather, [[Louis XV]]. Throughout his education, Louis-Auguste received a mixture of studies particular to religion, morality, and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Hardman, John, ''Louis XVI, The Silent King'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; His instructors may have also had a good hand in shaping Louis-Auguste into the indecisive king that he became. [[Abbé Berthier]], his instructor, taught him that timidity was a value in strong monarchs, and [[Abbé Soldini]], his confessor, instructed him not to let people read his mind.&lt;ref&gt;Hardman, John, ''Louis XVI, The Silent King'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==
[[File:Marie Antoinette and her Children by Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|[[Marie Antoinette]], [[List of Queens and Empresses of France|Queen of France]], with her three eldest children, [[Marie Thérèse of France|Marie-Thérèse]], [[Louis XVII of France|Louis-Charles]] and [[Louis-Joseph, Dauphin of France|Louis-Joseph]], by [[Marie Louise Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]]]]

On 16 May 1770, at the age of fifteen, Louis-Auguste married the fourteen-year-old Habsburg Archduchess [[Marie Antoinette|Maria Antonia]] (better known by the French form of her name, ''Marie Antoinette''), his [[cousin|second cousin once removed]] and the youngest daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] and his wife, the Empress [[Maria Theresa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardman1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hardman|title=Louis XVI: The Silent King and the Estates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nkJqSmHcd5oC&amp;pg=PA24 |year=1994|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-06077-5|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This marriage was met with hostility from the French public. France's alliance with Austria had pulled the country into the disastrous [[Seven Years' War]], in which it was defeated by the British and the Prussians, both in Europe and in North America. By the time that Louis-Auguste and Marie-Antoinette were married, the French people generally disliked the Austrian alliance, and Marie-Antoinette was seen as an unwelcome foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David. ''The Terror'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; For the young couple, the marriage was initially amiable but distant. Louis-Auguste's shyness and, among other factors, the young age and inexperience of the newlyweds (who were near total strangers to each other: they had met only two days before their wedding) meant that the 15-year-old bridegroom failed to consummate the union with his 14-year-old bride. His fear of being manipulated by her for imperial purposes caused him to behave coldly towards her in public.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Marie Antoinette'', pp.100–102&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the couple became closer, though while their marriage was reportedly consummated in July 1773, it did not actually happen until 1777.&lt;ref name=fraser127&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Marie Antoinette'', p.127&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple's failure to produce any children for several years placed a strain upon their marriage,&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Marie Antoinette'', pp.166–167&lt;/ref&gt; exacerbated by the publication of obscene pamphlets ([[libelle (literary genre)|''libelles'']]) mocking their infertility. One questioned, &quot;Can the King do it? Can't the King do it?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Marie Antoinette'', p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for the couple's initial failure to have children were debated at that time, and they have continued to be debated since. One suggestion is that Louis-Auguste suffered from a physiological dysfunction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.newyorker.com/printables/archive/021007fr_archive01| title = The New Yorker From the Archive Books| accessdate =17 October 2006| author=Francine du Plessix Gray| date = 7 August 2000| website=The Child Queen}}&lt;/ref&gt; most often thought to be [[phimosis]], a suggestion first made in late 1772 by the royal doctors.&lt;ref name=fraser122&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Marie Antoinette'', p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Historians adhering to this view suggest that he was [[circumcision|circumcised]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Androutsos|first=George|title=The Truth About Louis XVI's Marital Difficulties|url=http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=78|website=Translated from French|access-date=4 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518123742/http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=78|archive-date=18 May 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a common treatment for phimosis) to relieve the condition seven years after their marriage. Louis's doctors were not in favour of the surgery – the operation was delicate and traumatic, and capable of doing &quot;as much harm as good&quot; to an adult male. The argument for phimosis and a resulting operation is mostly seen to originate from [[Stefan Zweig]]'s 1932 biography of Marie Antoinette.

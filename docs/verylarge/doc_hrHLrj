In [[telecommunications]] and [[fiber optics]], a '''plastic-clad silica fiber''' or '''polymer-clad silica fiber''' (PCS) is an [[optical fiber]] that has a [[silica]]-based [[Fiber_optics#Principle_of_operation|core]] and a plastic [[Cladding (fiber optics)|cladding]]. The cladding of a PCS fiber should not be confused with the polymer overcoat of a conventional [[all-silica fiber]]. PCS fibers in general have significantly lower performance characteristics, particularly higher [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] losses and lower bandwidths, than all-glass fibers.

The main applications of plastic-clad silica fiber are industrial, medical or sensing applications where cores that are larger than those used in standard data communications fibers are advantageous.

'''Ingrid Bergman'''{{efn|{{IPA-sv|ˈɪ̌ŋːrɪd ˈbæ̌rjman|lang|Sv-Ingrid_Bergman_2.ogg}}}} (29 August 1915{{spnd}}29 August 1982) was a Swedish actress who starred in a variety of European and American films, television movies, and plays.&lt;ref name=&quot;WVobit&quot;&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 1 September 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;   With a career spanning 50 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Biography - The Official Licensing Website of Ingrid Bergman|url=https://www.ingridbergman.com/biography/|access-date=2020-11-12|website=Ingrid Bergman|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is often regarded as one of the most influential screen figures in film history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Harlan|first=Justin|date=2018-04-12|title=Criterion Honors the Great “Betterlater” with ECLIPSE SERIES 46: INGRID BERGMAN’S SWEDISH YEARS|url=https://cinapse.co/criterion-honors-the-great-betterlater-with-eclipse-series-46-ingrid-bergmans-swedish-years-81e2ffbf323|access-date=2020-11-12|website=Medium|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won [[List of awards and nominations received by Ingrid Bergman|many accolades]], including three [[Academy Awards]], two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Tony Award]], four [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and a [[BAFTA Award]].

Bergman was born in [[Stockholm]] to a Swedish father and a German mother and started her acting career in Swedish and German films. Her introduction to Americans came in the English-language remake of ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1939). In addition to ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), Bergman's notable performances from the 1940s include the dramas ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]; she won the award for ''Gaslight''. She made three films with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] including'' [[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945) and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946).

In 1950, she starred in [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'', following the revelation that she was having an extramarital affair with the director. The affair and then marriage to Rossellini created a scandal in the United States that forced her to remain in Europe for several years, during which she starred in Rossellini's ''[[Journey to Italy]]'' (1954), now critically acclaimed. She made a successful return to working for a Hollywood studio in ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), winning her second Academy Award for Best Actress.

In her later years, Bergman won her third Academy Award, this one for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], for her small role in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974). In 1978, she worked with director [[Ingmar Bergman]] in ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'', for which she received her sixth Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In her final acting role, she portrayed the late Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] in the television mini-series ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'' (1982) for which she posthumously won her second [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actress. Bergman died on her sixty-seventh birthday (29 August 1982) from [[breast cancer]].

According to the ''[[St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture]]'', Bergman quickly became &quot;the ideal of American womanhood&quot; and a contender for Hollywood's greatest leading actress.&lt;ref name=James&gt;{{cite book|first1=Tom|last1=Pendergast|first2=Sara|last2=Pendergast|title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|publisher=[[Gale Publishing]]|location=Farmington Hills, Michigan|date=2000|isbn=1-55862-405-8|title-link=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, she is considered to have brought a &quot;Nordic freshness and vitality&quot; to the screen, along with exceptional beauty and intelligence; [[David O. Selznick]] once called her &quot;the most completely conscientious actress&quot; he had ever worked with. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] recognized Bergman as the fourth greatest female [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|screen legend]] of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classic Hollywood Cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Stars|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|access-date=23 October 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020084914/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx|archive-date=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingrid Bergman was born on 29 August 1915 in Stockholm, to a Swedish father, Justus Samuel Bergman (2 May 1871 – 29 July 1929),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingridbergman.com/about/bio.htm|title=The Official Ingrid Bergman Web Site|website=Ingridbergman.com|access-date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his German wife, Frieda Henriette Auguste Louise ([[née]] Adler) Bergman (12 September 1884 – 19 January 1918), who was born in [[Kiel]].&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite book|author=Chandler, Charlotte|title=Ingrid: Ingrid Bergman, A Personal Biography|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2007|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7432-9421-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ingridingridberg00chan/page/19 19, 21, 294]|url=https://archive.org/details/ingridingridberg00chan/page/19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZuwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|title=Ingrid Bergman and her American Relatives|isbn=9780761861515|last1=Ziolkowska-Boehm|first1=Aleksandra|date=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents married in [[Hamburg]] on 13 June 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ancestrylibrary.proquest.com/aleweb/ale/do/login|title=Ancestry Library Edition|website=ancestrylibrary.proquest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Standesamt Hamburg'' 3, 1907 No. 173&lt;/ref&gt; She was named after [[Ingrid of Sweden|Princess Ingrid of Sweden]]. Although she was raised  in Sweden, she spent her summers in Germany and spoke fluent German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arne |last=Lunde |title=Nordic Exposures: Scandinavian Identities in Classical Hollywood Cinema |page=157 |publisher=University of Washington Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780295800844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergman suffered a succession of crucial losses in her infancy and childhood, which may have been experienced as abandonment. When she was two or three years old, her mother died. Justus Bergman had wanted her to become an opera star and had her take voice lessons for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Russell Taylor|first=John|url=https://archive.org/details/ingridbergman00tayl|title=Ingrid Bergman|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1983|isbn=0-312-41796-9|location=Great Britain|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sent her to the Palmgrenska Samskolan, a prestigious girls' school in Stockholm. Bergman was neither a good student nor popular one.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Since Justus was a photographer, he loved to document all her birthdays with his camera.&lt;ref name=LifeMag/&gt; He made his daughter one of his favorite photographic subjects. She enjoyed dancing, dressing up and acting in front of her father's lenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ingrid Bergman's early years {{!}} Sight &amp; Sound|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/ingrid-bergman-early-years-sweden-germany|access-date=21 October 2020|website=British Film Institute|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; “I was perhaps the most photographed child in Scandinavia,” quipped Bergman in her later years.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; In 1929, when Bergman was 13, her father died of stomach cancer. Losing her parents at such a tender age was a trauma to Bergman who later described as &quot;living with an ache&quot;, an experience she was not even aware of.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

After his death, she was sent to live with his sister, Ellen Bergman, who also died of heart disease only six months later. Bergman then lived with her maternal aunt Hulda and her husband Otto, who had five children of their own. She also visited her other maternal aunt, Elsa Adler, whom the young girl called ''Mutti'' (Mom) according to family lore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandler&quot; /&gt;{{rp|294}} She later said she &quot;knew from the beginning that [she] wanted to be an actress,&quot; sometimes wearing her deceased mother's clothing, and staging plays in her father's empty studio.

Bergman could speak Swedish and German as [[first language]]s, English and Italian (acquired later, while living in the US and Italy respectively),&lt;ref name=&quot;Leamer&quot; /&gt; and French (learned in school). She acted in each of these languages at various times.&lt;ref name=&quot;JP&quot; /&gt;

Bergman received a scholarship to the state-sponsored [[Royal Dramatic Theatre School]], where [[Greta Garbo]] had some years earlier earned a similar scholarship. After several months, she was given a part in a new play, ''Ett Brott'' (''A Crime''), written by [[Sigfrid Siwertz]]. This was &quot;totally against procedure&quot; at the school, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles.&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;{{rp|33}} During her first summer break, Bergman was hired by a Swedish film studio, which led to her leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre after just one year to work in films full time.

=== 1935−1938: Swedish years ===

Bergman's first film experience was as an [[Extra (acting)|extra]] in the 1932 film ''Landskamp'', an experience she described as &quot;walking on holy ground”.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; Her first speaking role was a small part in ''[[Munkbrogreven]]'' (1934).&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bfi.org.uk&quot; /&gt; Bergman played Elsa, a maid in a seedy hotel, being pursued by the leading man, [[Edvin Adolphson]]. Critics called her &quot;hefty and sure of herself” and “somewhat overweight . . . with an unusual way of speaking her lines.” The unflatteringly striped costume that she wore, may have contributed to the unfavorable comments, regarding her appearance.&lt;ref name=Eclipse/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bfi.org.uk&quot; /&gt; Soon after&amp;nbsp;''Munkbrogreven'', Bergman was offered a studio contract and placed under director [[Gustaf Molander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bfi.org.uk&quot; /&gt;

She left the Royal Dramatic Theater to pursue acting full time. Bergman starred in ''[[Ocean Breakers]]'' in which she played a fisherman's daughter, and then in ''[[Swedenhielms]]'',  where she had the opportunity to work alongside her idol [[Gösta Ekman (senior)|Gösta Ekman]]. Next, she starred in ''Walpurgis Night'' (1935).&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bfi.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ingrid Bergman's early years {{!}} Sight &amp; Sound|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/ingrid-bergman-early-years-sweden-germany|access-date=17 October 2020|website=British Film Institute|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Eclipse/&gt; She plays Lena, a secretary in love with her boss, Johan who is unhappily married. Throughout, Lena and the wife vye for Johan's affection with the wife losing her husband to Lena at the end. &lt;ref name=Eclipse/&gt;  In 1936, in ''On the Sunny Side'' she was cast as an orphan from a good family who marries a rich older gentleman. 

Also in 1936, she appeared in ''[[Intermezzo (1936 film)|Intermezzo]]'', her first lead performance, where she was reunited with Gösta Ekman. This was a pivotal film for the young actress, and allowed her to demonstrate her talent. Director Molander later said &quot;I created Intermezzo for her, but I was not responsible for its success. Ingrid herself made it successful.” &lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bfi.org.uk&quot; /&gt; In 1938, she starred in&amp;nbsp;''[[Only One Night (1939 film)|Only One Night]]''&amp;nbsp;and played a manor house girl, an upper-class woman living on a country estate. She didn't like the part, calling it 'a piece of rubbish'.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hutchinson|first=Pamela|title=Eclipse Series 46: Ingrid Bergman's Swedish Years|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/5543-eclipse-series-46-ingrid-bergman-s-swedish-years|access-date=30 October 2020|website=The Criterion Collection|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She only agreed to appear if only she could star in the studio's next film project ''En kvinnas ansikte.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Only One Night (1939) - IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031270/trivia|language=en|access-date=19 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt; She later acted in ''Dollar'' (1938), &lt;ref name=Eclipse/&gt; a Scandinivian screwball comedy. Bergman had just been voted Sweden's most admired movie star in the previous year, and received top-billing. ''Svenska Dagbladet'' wrote in its review; &quot;Ingrid Bergman's feline appearance as an industrial tycoon's wife overshadows them all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt; 

In her next film, a role created especially for her,&amp;nbsp;''[[A Woman's Face (1938 film)|En kvinnas ansikte]]'' (''A Woman's Face''), she played against her usual casting, as a bitter, unsympathetic character, whose face had been hideously burned. Anna Holm is the leader of a blackmail gang that targets the wealthy folk of Stockholm for their money and jewellery. &lt;ref name=Eclipse/&gt; The film required Bergman to wear heavy makeup, as well as glue, to simulate a burned face. A brace was put in place to distort the shape of one cheek. &lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bfi.org.uk&quot; /&gt;  In her diary, she called the film “my own picture, my very own. I have fought for it.” The critics loved her performance, citing her as an actor of great talent and conﬁdence.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bfi.org.uk&quot; /&gt; The film was awarded a Special Recommendation at the [[1938 Venice Film Festival]] for its &quot;overall artistic contribution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20110614063501/http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-film/Filmdatabasen/?itemid=3863&amp;type=MOVIE&amp;iv=Awards En kvinnas ansikte - Utmärkelser] (in Swedish).

Bergman signed a three-picture contract with UFA, the German major film company, although she only made one picture. At the time, she was pregnant but nonetheless, she arrived in Berlin to begin filming&amp;nbsp;''[[The Four Companions (film)|The Four Companions]]'' (Die vier Gesellen)(1938), directed by [[Carl Froelich]]. The film was intended as a star vehicle to launch Bergman's career in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lunde | first = Arne | title = Nordic Exposures: Scandinavian Identities in Classical Hollywood Cinema | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 2010 | location = Seattle | isbn = 978-0-295-99045-3}} &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|157}} &lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bfi.org.uk&quot; /&gt; In the film she played one of four ambitious young women, attempting to set up a graphic design agency. The film was a lighthearted combination of comedy and romance. At first, she did not comprehend the political and social situation in Germany. Later she said &quot;I saw very quickly that if you were anybody at all in ﬁlms, you had to be a member of the Nazi party.”&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bfi.org.uk&quot;/&gt; By September, she was back in Sweden, and gave birth to her daughter, Pia.

Bergman appeared in eleven films in her native Sweden before the age of twenty-five. Her characters were always plagued with uncertainty, fear and anxiety. The early Swedish films were not masterpieces,&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ingrid Bergman's Swedish film|url=http://kinotuskanac.hr/en/article/svedski-filmovi-ingrid-bergman|access-date=19 October 2020|website=Kino Tuškanac|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she worked with some of the biggest talents in the Swedish film industry such as Gösta Ekman, Karin Swanström, Victor Sjöström, and Lars Hanson. It showcased her immense acting talent, as a young woman with a bright future ahead of her.&lt;ref name=Eclipse&gt;{{Cite web|title=Eclipse Series 46: Ingrid Bergman's Swedish Years|url=https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/1315-eclipse-series-46-ingrid-bergman-s-swedish-years|access-date=17 October 2020|website=The Criterion Collection|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1939−1949: Hollywood and stage work breakthrough===
[[File:Intermezzo- A Love Story (1939) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Bergman in a scene from ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1939)|220x220px|left]]
Bergman's first acting role in the United States was in ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'' by [[Gregory Ratoff]] which premiered on 22 September 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/5126-INTERMEZZO-A-LOVE-STORY?cxt=filmography|access-date=16 October 2020|website=catalog.afi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She accepted the invitation of [[Hollywood]] producer [[David O. Selznick]], who wished her to star in the English-language remake of her earlier Swedish film ''[[Intermezzo (1936 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1936). Unable to speak English, and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden. Her husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindström, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia (born 1938).&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;{{rp|63}} In ''Intermezzo'', she played the role of a young piano accompanist, opposite [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], who played a famous violin virtuoso. Bergman arrived in [[Los Angeles]] on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence. 

According to Selznick's son Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had concerns about Bergman: &quot;She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick&quot;. Bergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandler&quot; /&gt;{{rp|6}} &quot;He let her have her way&quot;, notes a story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and &quot;instructed them to lay off&quot;. He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's &quot;synthetic razzle-dazzle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LifeMag&quot; /&gt; 
During the following weeks, while ''Intermezzo'' was being filmed, Selznick was also filming ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman: {{quote|Miss Bergman is the most completely conscientious actress with whom I have ever worked, in that she thinks of absolutely nothing but her work before and during the time she is doing a picture&amp;nbsp;... She practically never leaves the studio, and even suggested that her dressing room be equipped so that she could live here during the picture. She never for a minute suggests quitting at six o'clock or anything of the kind&amp;nbsp;...

''Intermezzo'' became an enormous success and as a result Bergman became a star. Ratoff, said, &quot;She is sensational.&quot; This was the &quot;sentiment of the entire set&quot;, wrote a retrospective,{{Vague|date=October 2020}}&lt;!-- Which retrospective? --&gt; adding that workmen went out of their way to do things for her and that the cast and crew &quot;admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LifeMag&quot; /&gt; Film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] notes that this became &quot;the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America&quot;, where her lack of make-up contributed to an &quot;air of nobility&quot;. According to ''Life'', the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall girl &quot;with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy, but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LifeMag&quot; /&gt; Selznick appreciated her uniqueness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|76}} Bergman was hailed as a fine new talent, and received many positive reviews. [[The New York Times]] noted her &quot;freshness and simplicity and natural dignity&quot; and the maturity of her acting which was nonetheless, free of &quot;stylistic traits - the mannerisms, postures, precise inflections - that become the stock in trade of the matured actress.&quot; [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] noted that she was warm and convincing, and provided an &quot;arresting performance&quot; and that her &quot;charm, sincerity&quot; ...and &quot;infectious vivaciousness&quot; would &quot;serve her well in both comedy and drama.&quot; There was also recognition of her natural appearance, in contrast to other film actresses. [[The New York Tribune]] said: &quot;Using scarcely any makeup, but playing with mobile intensity, she creates the character so vividly and credibility that it becomes the core of [the] narrative&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quirk&quot; /&gt;{{rp|73–74}}

Selznick was worried that his new starlet's value would diminish if she received bad reviews. Brooks Atkinson of ''The New York Times'' reviewed that Bergman seemed at ease, and commanded the stage that evening.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; That same year she starred in ''[[June Night]],'' (''Juninatten'') a [[Swedish language]] [[drama]] film directed by [[Per Lindberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Chandler  ''Ingrid: Ingrid Bergman, A Personal Biography'' 71 141653914X - 2007 -&quot;... more films in Germany ended, Ingrid started the last Swedish film she had agreed to do, June Night.

On 5 October 1946, Bergman appeared in ''Joan of Lorraine'' at the Alvin Theatre in New York. Tickets were fully booked for a twelve-week run. It was the greatest hit in New York. After each performance, crowds were in line to see Bergman in person. ''[[Newsweek]]'' called her 'Queen of the Broadway Season.' She reportedly received roughly $129,000 plus 15 percent of the grosses. ''The Associated Press'' named her 'Woman of the Year'. ''Gallup'' certified her as the most popular actress in America.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

On 17 February 1948, [[Arch of Triumph (1948 film)|''Arch of Triumph'']], by [[Lewis Milestone]] was released with Bergman and [[Charles Boyer]] as the leading roles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/25448-ARCH-OF-TRIUMPH?cxt=filmography|access-date=16 October 2020|website=catalog.afi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Erich Maria Remarque's book, it follows a story of Joan Madou, an Italian-Romanian refugee who works as a cabaret singer in a Paris nightclub.

The independent film was based on the Maxwell Anderson play ''[[Joan of Lorraine]]'', which had earned her a [[Tony Award]] earlier that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leamer&quot; /&gt; Produced by [[Walter Wanger]] and initially released through [[RKO]]. Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, then chose to appear on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the Rossellini scandal, which broke while the film was still in theatres. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and, although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination. It was subsequently cut by 45 minutes, but restored to full length in 1998, and released in 2004 on DVD.

''[[Under Capricorn]]'' premiered on 9 September 1949, as another Bergman and Hitchcock collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/768-UNDER-CAPRICORN?cxt=filmography|access-date=16 October 2020|website=catalog.afi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is set in the Australia of 1770. The story opens as Charles Adare, played by [[Michael Wilding]], arrives in [[New South Wales]] with his uncle. Desperate to find his fortune, Adare meets Sam Flusky ([[Joseph Cotten]]), who is married to Charles's childhood friend Lady Henrietta (Bergman), an alcoholic kept locked in their mansion. Soon, Flusky becomes jealous of Adare's affections for his wife. The film met with negative reactions from critics. Some of the negativity may have based on disapproval of Bergman's affair with the Italian director [[Roberto Rossellini]]. Their scandalous relationship became apparent, shortly after the film's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=13 July 2018|title=Film Geeks Know That Hitchcock's 'Under Capricorn' Is So Much More Than Merely a Costume Drama|url=https://www.popmatters.com/under-capricorn-alfred-hitchcock-2584067831.html?rebelltitem=5#rebelltitem5?rebelltitem=5|access-date=10 October 2020|website=PopMatters|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She wrote to him in 1949, expressing her admiration and suggesting that she make a film with him. As a consequence, she was cast in ''Stromboli''. During the production, they began an affair, and Bergman became pregnant with their first child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bondanella&quot;&gt;Bondanella, Peter E.

This affair caused a huge scandal in the United States, where it led to Bergman being denounced on the floor of the [[United States Senate]]. On 14 March 1950, Senator [[Edwin C.

She had played a nun in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and a virgin saint in ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948). Bergman later said, &quot;People saw me in ''Joan of Arc'', and declared me a saint. I'm not. I'm just a woman, another human being.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoto&quot;&gt;Spoto, Donald.

As a result of the scandal, Bergman returned to Italy, leaving her first husband and went through a publicized divorce and custody battle for their daughter. Bergman and Rossellini were married on 24 May 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v5rU6O_490gC&amp;q=Rossellini&amp;pg=PA90|title=Ingrid Bergman: The Life, Career and Public Image|last=Smit|first=David|date=12 October 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476600598|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States the film was a [[box office bomb]] but did better overseas, where Bergman and Rossellini's affair was considered less scandalous. In all, RKO lost $200,000 on the picture.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewell&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jewell|first=Richard B.|title=Slow Fade to Black: The Decline of RKO Radio Pictures|date=2016|publisher=University of California|isbn=9780520289673|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, it was awarded the Rome Prize for Cinema as the best film of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;dagrada&quot;&gt;Dagrada, Elena. &quot;A Triple Alliance for a Catholic Neorealism: Roberto Rossellini According to Felix Norton, Giulio Andreotti and Gian Luigi Rondi.&quot; ''Moralizing Cinema: Film, Catholicism, and Power.''

The initial reception in America, however, was very negative. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opened his review by writing: &quot;After all the unprecedented interest that the picture 'Stromboli' has aroused — it being, of course, the fateful drama which Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini have made — it comes as a startling anticlimax to discover that this widely heralded film is incredibly feeble, inarticulate, uninspiring and painfully banal.&quot; Crowther added that Bergman's character &quot;is never drawn with clear and revealing definition, due partly to the vagueness of the script and partly to the dullness and monotony with which Rossellini has directed her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|date=16 February 1950|title=The Screen In Review|journal=[[The New York Times]]|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The staff at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' agreed, writing, &quot;Director Roberto Rossellini purportedly denied responsibility for the film, claiming the American version was cut by RKO beyond recognition. Cut or not cut, the film reflects no credit on him. Given elementary-school dialog to recite and impossible scenes to act, Ingrid Bergman's never able to make the lines real nor the emotion sufficiently motivated to seem more than an exercise ... The only visible touch of the famed Italian director is in the hard photography, which adds to the realistic, documentary effect of life on the rocky, lava-blanketed island. Rossellini's penchant for realism, however, does not extend to Bergman. She's always fresh, clean and well-groomed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=15 February 1950|title=Stromboli|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' wrote: &quot;As entertainment, it does have a few moments of distinction, but on the whole it is a dull slow-paced piece, badly edited and mediocre in writing, direction and acting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=18 February 1950|title='Stromboli' with Ingrid Bergman|journal=[[Harrison's Reports]]|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McCarten]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' found that there was &quot;nothing whatsoever in the footage that rises above the humdrum&quot;, and felt that Bergman &quot;doesn't really seem to have her heart in any of the scenes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarten|first=John|date=25 February 1950|title=The Current Cinema|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard L. Coe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' lamented, &quot;It's a pity that many people who never go to foreign-made pictures will be drawn into this by the Rossellini-Bergman names and will think that this flat, drab, inept picture is what they've been missing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coe|first=Richard L.|date=16 February 1950|title=All That Fuss, and The Thing Is Dull|journal=[[The Washington Post]]|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent assessments have been more positive. Reviewing the film in 2013 in conjunction with its DVD release as part of [[The Criterion Collection]], [[Dave Kehr]] called the film &quot;one of the pioneering works of modern European filmmaking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kehr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kehr|first=Dave|date=27 September 2013|title=Rossellini and Bergman's Break From Tradition|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/movies/homevideo/ingrid-bergman-in-3-rossellini-films-from-criterion.html|access-date=2 June 2018|website=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an expansive analysis of the film, critic Fred Camper wrote of the drama, &quot;Like many of cinema's masterpieces, ''Stromboli'' is fully explained only in a final scene that brings into harmony the protagonist's state of mind and the imagery. This structure...suggests a belief in the transformative power of revelation. Forced to drop her suitcase (itself far more modest than the trunks she arrived with) as she ascends the volcano, Karin is stripped of her pride and reduced — or elevated — to the condition of a crying child, a kind of first human being who, divested of the trappings of self, must learn to see and speak again from a personal &quot;year zero&quot; (to borrow from another Rossellini film title).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Camper, Fred.

The [[Venice Film Festival]] ranked ''Stromboli'' among the 100 most important Italian films (&quot;[[100 film italiani da salvare]]&quot;) from 1942–1978. In 2012, the [[British Film Institute]]'s ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' critics' poll also listed it as one of the 250 greatest films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STROMBOLI, TERRA DI DIO (1950)|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b6b6d8bc6|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820045845/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b6b6d8bc6|archive-date=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

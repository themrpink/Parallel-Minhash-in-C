In the aftermath of the revolt, French power extended throughout Poitou, threatening the interests of the Lusignan family.&lt;ref name=Jobson2012P11/&gt; In 1247 Henry encouraged his relatives to travel to England, where they were rewarded with large estates, largely at the expense of the English barons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Vincent|2006|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Henry's step-father Hugh de Lusignan died in 1249.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vincent|2007|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} More Poitevins followed, until around 100 had settled in England, around two-thirds of them being granted substantial incomes worth £66 or more by Henry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridgeway 1988 81–82&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ridgeway|1988|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money}} Henry encouraged some to help him on the continent; others acted as mercenaries and diplomatic agents, or fought on Henry's behalf in European campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ridgeway|1988|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were given estates along the contested Welsh Marches, or in Ireland, where they protected the frontiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ridgeway|1988|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Henry, the community was an important symbol of his hopes to one day reconquer Poitou and the rest of his French lands, and many of the Lusignans became close friends with his son Edward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vincent|2006|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Henry's extended family in England proved controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridgeway 1988 81–82&quot;/&gt; Concerns were raised by contemporary chroniclers – especially in works of Roger de Wendover and Matthew Paris – about the number of foreigners in England and historian Martin Aurell notes the xenophobic overtones of their commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aurell|2003|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Poitevins&quot; became loosely applied to this grouping, although many came from Anjou and other parts of France, and by the 1250s there was a fierce rivalry between the relatively well established Savoyards and the newly arrived Poitevins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ridgeway|1988|p=90}}; {{harvnb|Aurell|2003|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lusignans began to break the law with impunity, pursuing personal grievances against other barons and the Savoyards, and Henry took little or no action to restrain them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1258, the general dislike of the Poitevins had turned into hatred, with Simon de Montfort one of their strongest critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=9–10}}; {{harvnb|Ridgeway|1988|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland, Wales and Ireland===
Henry's position in Wales was strengthened during the first two decades of his personal rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter 2004 362&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Llywelyn the Great in 1240, Henry's power in Wales expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2006|p=82}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three military campaigns were carried out in the 1240s, new castles were constructed and the royal lands in the [[County of Chester]] were expanded, increasing Henry's dominance over the Welsh princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2006|pp=82–93}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn|Dafydd]], Llywelyn's son, resisted the incursions, but died in 1246, and Henry confirmed the [[Treaty of Woodstock]] the following year with [[Owain Goch ap Gruffydd|Owain]] and [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], Llywelyn the Great's grandsons, under which they ceded land to the King but retained the heart of their princedom in [[Gwynedd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Wales, Henry gradually extended his authority across the region, but the campaigns were not pursued with vigour and the King did little to stop the Marcher territories along the border becoming increasingly independent of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=365–366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1256, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd rebelled against Henry and widespread violence spread across Wales. Henry promised a swift military response but did not carry through on his threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=364}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland was important to Henry, both as a source of royal revenue – an average of £1,150 was sent from Ireland to the Crown each year during the middle of his reign – and as a source of estates that could be granted to his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money}} The major landowners looked eastwards towards Henry's court for political leadership, and many also possessed estates in Wales and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frame|1992|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1240s saw major upheavals in land ownership due to deaths among the barons, enabling Henry to redistribute Irish lands to his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frame|1992|pp=192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1250s, the King gave out numerous grants of land along the frontier in Ireland to his supporters, creating a buffer zone against the [[Irish people|native Irish]]. The local [[List of High Kings of Ireland|Irish kings]] began to suffer increased harassment as English power increased across the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frame|1992|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lands were in many cases unprofitable for the barons to hold and English power reached its zenith under Henry for the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frame|1992|pp=179, 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1254, Henry granted Ireland to his son, Edward, on condition that it would never be separated from the Crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter 2004 362&quot;/&gt;

Henry maintained peace with Scotland during his reign, where he was the feudal lord of [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2006|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry assumed that he had the right to interfere in Scottish affairs and brought up the issue of his authority with the Scottish kings at key moments, but he lacked the inclination or the resources to do much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2006|p=85}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander had occupied parts of northern England during the First Barons' War but had been excommunicated and forced to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=327–328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander married Henry's sister Joan in 1221, and after he and Henry signed the [[Treaty of York]] in 1237, Henry had a secure northern frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2006|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry knighted [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] before the young King married Henry's daughter Margaret in 1251 and, despite Alexander's refusal to give homage to Henry for Scotland, the two enjoyed a good relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2006|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry had Alexander and Margaret rescued from [[Edinburgh Castle]] when they were imprisoned there by a rebellious Scottish baron in 1255 and took additional measures to manage Alexander's government during the rest of his minority years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European strategy===
[[File:Paris.elefant.jpg|thumb|alt=Sketch of elephant|Henry's elephant, given to him by [[Louis IX of France]], by Matthew Paris]]
Henry had no further opportunities to reconquer his possessions in France after the collapse of his military campaign at the [[battle of Taillebourg]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Henry's resources were quite inadequate in comparison to those of the French Crown, and by the end of the 1240s it was clear that King Louis had become the preeminent power across France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aurell|2003|pp=30–31}}; {{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry instead adopted what historian [[Michael Clanchy]] has described as a &quot;European strategy&quot;, attempting to regain his lands in France through diplomacy rather than force, building alliances with other states prepared to put military pressure on the French King.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Clanchy|1998|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Henry cultivated Frederick II, hoping he would turn against Louis or allow his nobility to join Henry's campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=104–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, Henry's attention became increasingly focused on European politics and events rather than domestic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crusading was a popular cause in the 13th century, and in 1248 Louis joined the ill-fated [[Seventh Crusade]], having first made a fresh truce with England and received assurances from the Pope that he would protect his lands against any attack by Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=278}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry might have joined this crusade himself, but the rivalry between the two kings made this impossible and, after Louis's defeat at the [[Battle of Al Mansurah]] in 1250, Henry instead announced that he would be undertaking his own crusade to the Levant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maier|2003|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=140}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Some accounts suggest that Louis of France prevented Henry from joining the Seventh Crusade, others that Henry himself did not want to join it because of Louis's leadership role.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maier|2003|p=63}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He began to make arrangements for passage with friendly rulers around the Levant, imposing efficiency savings on the royal household and arranging for ships and transport: he appeared almost over-eager to take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=140–141}}; {{harvnb|Tyerman|1996|p=123}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's plans reflected his strong religious beliefs, but they also stood to give him additional international credibility when arguing for the return of his possessions in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=140–141}}; {{harvnb|Tyerman|1996|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louis9 Innocentius4 Cluny.jpg|thumb|alt=Illuminated manuscript picture|14th-century representation of [[Pope Innocent IV]] (l) and Louis IX (r), 1248]]
Henry did not give up on his hopes for a crusade, but became increasingly absorbed in a bid to acquire the wealthy [[Kingdom of Sicily]] for his son Edmund.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sicily had been controlled by Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire, for many years a rival of Pope Innocent IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=122, 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Frederick's death in 1250, Innocent started to look for a new ruler, one more amenable to the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=147–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry saw Sicily as both a valuable prize for his son and as an excellent base for his crusading plans in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; With minimal consultation within his court, Henry came to an agreement with the Pope in 1254 that Edmund should be the next king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=149, 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innocent urged Henry to send Edmund with an army to reclaim Sicily from Frederick's son [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred]], offering to contribute to the expenses of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=149, 152}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innocent was succeeded by [[Pope Alexander IV]], who was facing increasing military pressure from the Empire.&lt;ref name=Weiler2012P152Jobson2012P13&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=152}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He could no longer afford to pay Henry's expenses, instead demanding that Henry compensate the Papacy for the £90,000 spent on the war so far.&lt;ref name=Weiler2012P152Jobson2012P13/&gt;{{efn|name=Money}} This was a huge sum, and Henry turned to parliament for help in 1255, only to be rebuffed. Further attempts followed, but by 1257 only partial parliamentary assistance had been offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander grew increasingly unhappy about Henry's procrastinations and in 1258 sent an envoy to England, threatening to excommunicate Henry if he did not first pay his debts to the Papacy and then send the promised army to Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=155–156}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament again refused to assist the King in raising this money.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead Henry turned to extorting money from the senior clergy, who were forced to sign blank charters, promising to pay effectively unlimited sums of money in support of the King's efforts, raising around £40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money}} The English Church felt the money was wasted, vanishing into the long-running war in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Henry attempted to influence the outcomes of the elections in the Holy Roman Empire, which would appoint a new [[King of the Romans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the more prominent German candidates failed to gain traction, Henry began to back his brother Richard's candidature, giving donations to his potential supporters in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard was elected in 1256 with expectations of possibly being crowned the Holy Roman Emperor, but continued to play a major role in English politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=165, 194}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; His election faced a mixed response in England; Richard was believed to provide moderate, sensible counsel and his presence was missed by the English barons, but he also faced criticism, probably incorrectly, for funding his German campaign at England's expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Henry now had increased support in the Empire for a potential alliance against Louis of France, the two kings were now moving towards potentially settling their disputes peacefully; for Henry, a peace treaty could allow him to focus on Sicily and his crusade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=133}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later reign (1258–72)==

===Revolution===
[[File:Gal nations edward i - trimmed.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Edward I|Probable late 13th or early 14th-century depiction of Henry's eldest son, Edward]]
In 1258, Henry faced a revolt among the English barons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 152–153}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger had grown about the way the King's officials were raising funds, the influence of the Poitevins at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy, and resentment of abuse of purchased Jewish loans.&lt;ref name=hillaby2013p5353/&gt; Even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 153}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=347–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh were still in open revolt, and now allied themselves with Scotland.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Henry was also critically short of money. Although he still had some reserves of gold and silver, they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures, including the campaign for Sicily and his debts to the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|pp=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending to profit from the crusading tithes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tyerman|1996|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; To compound the situation, the harvests in England failed.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Within Henry's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discontent finally erupted in April, when seven of the major English and Savoyard barons – Simon de Montfort, Roger and Hugh Bigod, [[John Fitzgeoffrey]], [[Peter de Montfort]], Peter de Savoy and Richard de Clare – secretly formed an alliance to expel the Lusignans from court, a move probably quietly supported by the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=18–19}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 153}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April, Roger Bigod marched into Westminster in the middle of the King's parliament, backed by his co-conspirators, and carried out a coup d'état.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 153}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry, fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned, agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen, half chosen by the King and half by the barons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 154–154}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own nominees to the council drew heavily on the hated Lusignans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pressure for reform continued to grow unabated and a fresh parliament met in June, passing a set of measures known as the [[Provisions of Oxford]], which Henry swore to uphold.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 156}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=22, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then had the power to appoint England's justiciar, chancellor, and treasurer, and which would be monitored through triannual parliaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The actual election procedure for the council was, as historian Adrian Jobson describes, &quot;rather convoluted&quot;; the twelve Royalist members of the first, Bigod-inspired council elected two nominees, followed by the twelve baronial members electing an additional two nominees; these four men would then elect the remainder of the council. The result was a heavily baronial council.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both Henry's officials and the major barons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=22–23}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elected council included representatives of the Savoyard faction but no Poitevins, and the new government immediately took steps to exile the leading Lusignans and to seize key castles across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 156–157}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disagreements between the leading barons involved in the revolt soon became evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority and power of the major barons as well as the Crown; others, such as Hugh Bigod, promoted only moderate change, while the conservative barons, such as Richard, expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King's powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's son, Edward, initially opposed the revolution, but then allied himself with de Montfort, helping him to pass the radical [[Provisions of Westminster]] in 1259, which introduced further limits on the major barons and local royal officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=26, 38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louis9+Henri3+StDenis.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Henry and Louis IX|14th-century representation of Henry visiting Louis IX of France]]
Over the next four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England, and power swung back and forth between the different factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=372–377}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the priorities for the new regime was to settle the long-running dispute with France and, at the end of 1259, Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace treaty]] with King Louis, escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=21, 45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the treaty, Henry gave up any claim to his family's lands in the north of France, but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south, giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Simon de Montfort returned to England, Henry, supported by Eleanor, remained in Paris where he seized the opportunity to reassert royal authority and began to issue royal orders independently of the barons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry finally returned to retake power in England in April 1260, where conflict was brewing between Richard de Clare's forces and those of Simon and Edward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's brother Richard mediated between the parties and averted a military confrontation; Edward was reconciled with his father and Simon was put on trial for his actions against the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was unable to maintain his grip on power, and in October a coalition headed by Simon, Richard and Edward briefly seized back control; within months their baronial council had collapsed into chaos as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry continued to publicly support the Provisions of Oxford, but he secretly opened discussions with [[Pope Urban IV]], hoping to be absolved from the oath he had made at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1261, the King announced that Rome had released him from his promises and he promptly held a counter-coup with the support of Edward.&lt;ref name=Jobson2012PP6164&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=61–64, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; He purged the ranks of the sheriffs of his enemies and seized back control of many of the royal castles.&lt;ref name=Jobson2012PP6164/&gt; The baronial opposition, led by Simon and Richard, were temporarily reunited in their opposition to Henry's actions, convening their own parliament, independent of the King, and establishing a rival system of local government across England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=64–67, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry and Eleanor mobilised their own supporters and raised a foreign mercenary army.&lt;ref name=Jobson2012PP70&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing the threat of open civil war, the barons backed down: de Clare switched sides once again, Simon left for exile in France and the baronial resistance collapsed.&lt;ref name=Jobson2012PP70/&gt;

Henry's government relied primarily on Eleanor and her Savoyard supporters, and it proved short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to settle the crisis permanently by forcing the barons to agree to the Treaty of Kingston.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between the King and the barons, using Richard as an initial adjudicator, backed up by Louis of France should Richard fail to generate a compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry softened some of his policies in response to the concerns of the barons, but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had done nothing significant to deal with the concerns over Baronial and royal abuse of Jewish debts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stacey 2003 52&quot;/&gt; Henry's government was weakened by the death of Richard, as his heir, [[Gilbert de Clare, 5th Earl of Gloucester]], sided with the radicals; the King's position was further undermined by major Welsh incursions along the Marches and the Pope's decision to reverse his judgement on the Provisions, this time confirming them as legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=79–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1263, Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Barons' War===
{{main|Second Barons' War}}
[[File:Montfort Evesham.jpg|thumb|alt=Cloth drawing|A 13th-century depiction of the mutilation of [[Simon de Montfort]]'s body following the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265]]

Simon returned to England in April 1263 and convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford to pursue a renewed anti-Poitevin agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revolt broke out shortly afterwards in the Welsh Marches and, by October, England faced a likely civil war between Henry, backed by Edward, Hugh Bigod and the conservative barons, and Simon, Gilbert de Clare and the radicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=86–89}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=374–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels leveraged concern among knights over abuse of Jewish loans, who feared losing their lands, a problem Henry had done much to create and nothing to solve.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stacey 2003 53&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stacey|2003|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case following, the rebels employed violence and killings in a deliberate attempt to destroy the records of their debts to Jewish lenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huscroft|2006|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt, where 500 Jews died.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry and Eleanor were trapped in the Tower of London by the rebels. The Queen attempted to escape up the [[River Thames]] to join Edward's army at Windsor, but was forced to retreat by the London crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon took the pair prisoners, and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry's name, the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own, trusted men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wild|2011|pp=41–42, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon's coalition began to quickly fragment, Henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry appealed to Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute, as had been laid out in the Treaty of Kingston; Simon was initially hostile to this idea, but, as war became more likely again, he decided to agree to French arbitration as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry went to Paris in person, accompanied by Simon's representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Simon's legal arguments held sway, but in January 1264, Louis announced the [[Mise of Amiens]], condemning the rebels, upholding the King's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=13–105}}; {{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis had strong views of his own on the rights of kings over those of barons, but was also influenced by his wife, Margaret, who was Eleanor's sister, and by the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The wording of Louis's judgement in the case also appears to suggest that Louis believed that he had feudal authority over Henry, as a consequence of Henry having given homage to him for Gascony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Leaving Eleanor in Paris to assemble mercenary reinforcements, Henry returned to England in February 1264, where violence was brewing in response to the unpopular French decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=107–109}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Barons' War]] finally broke out in April 1264, when Henry led an army into Simon's territories in the Midlands, and then advanced south-east to re-occupy the important route to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=109–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming desperate, Simon marched in pursuit of Henry and the two armies met at the [[Battle of Lewes]] on 14 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=113–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their numerical superiority, Henry's forces were overwhelmed.&lt;ref name=Jobson2012PP115&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=115, 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Richard was captured, and Henry and Edward retreated to the local priory and surrendered the following day.&lt;ref name=Jobson2012PP115/&gt; Henry was forced to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the Provisions of Oxford, leaving him, as historian Adrian Jobson describes, &quot;little more than a figurehead&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=117, 122}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Henry's power diminished, Simon cancelled many debts and interest owed to Jews, including those held by his baronial supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=132}} {{harvnb|Hillaby|Hillaby|2013|pp=656–657}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|&quot;After Simon's victory at the battle of Lewes in May 1264, some 60 men received royal writs pardoning debts and interest owed to Jews. The beneficiaries included prominent supporters, such as John d'Eyville and Simon's own retainers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hillaby|Hillaby|2013|pp=656–657}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Simon was unable to consolidate his victory and widespread disorder persisted across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England with the support of Louis, while Edward escaped his captors in May and formed a new army.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=120–121, 136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued Simon's forces through the Marches, before striking east to attack his fortress at Kenilworth and then turning once more on the rebel leader himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=138–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon, accompanied by the captive Henry, was unable to retreat and the [[Battle of Evesham]] ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=140–142, 144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was triumphant and Simon's corpse was mutilated by the victors. Henry, who was wearing borrowed armour, was almost killed by Edward's forces during the fighting before they recognised the King and escorted him to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=140–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In places the now leaderless rebellion dragged on, with some rebels gathering at Kenilworth, which Henry and Edward took after a long siege in 1266.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=149–152, 154–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continued targeting Jews and their debt records.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stacey 2003 53&quot;/&gt; The remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up, and the final rebels, holed up in the [[Isle of Ely]], surrendered in July 1267, marking the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=381}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconciliation and reconstruction===
Henry quickly took revenge on his enemies after the Battle of Evesham.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=150}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately ordered the [[Sequestration (law)|sequestration]] of all the rebel lands, triggering a wave of chaotic looting across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=150–151}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry initially rejected any calls for moderation, but in October 1266 he was persuaded by Papal Legate [[Ottobuono de' Fieschi]] to issue a less draconian policy, called the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]], which allowed for the return of the rebels' lands, in exchange for the payment of harsh fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=152, 156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statute of Marlborough]] followed in November 1267, which effectively reissued much of the Provisions of Westminster, placing limitations on the powers of local royal officials and the major barons, but without restricting central royal authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobson 2012 162–163&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=162–163}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the exiled Poitevins began to return to England after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ridgeway|1988|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1267 Henry made the [[Treaty of Montgomery]] with Llywelyn, recognising him as the Prince of Wales and giving substantial land concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final years of his reign, Henry was increasingly infirm and focused on securing peace within the kingdom and his own religious devotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=164}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward became the Steward of England and began to play a more prominent role in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's finances were in a precarious state as a result of the war, and when Edward decided to join the crusades in 1268 it became clear that fresh taxes were necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobson 2012 162–163&quot;/&gt; Henry was concerned that Edward's absence might encourage further revolts, but was swayed by his son to negotiate with multiple parliaments over the next two years to raise the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=164}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=382}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Henry had initially reversed Simon de Montfort's anti-Jewish policies, including attempting to restore the debts owed to Jews where these could be proven, he faced pressure from parliament to introduce restrictions on Jewish bonds, particularly their sale to Christians, in the final years of his reign in return for financing.&lt;ref name=stacey2003p53huscroftp107&gt;{{harvnb|Stacey|2003|p=53}}; {{harvnb|Huscroft|2006|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Henry agreed to limits on fee-rents, restrictions on sale of Jewish loans to Christians and a prohibition on levying interest on loans purchased by Christians. These were the grievances that had helped fuel the wider crisis since 1239.&lt;ref name=stacey2003p53huscroftp107/&gt;}} Henry continued to invest in Westminster Abbey, which became a replacement for the Angevin mausoleum at [[Fontevraud Abbey]], and in 1269 he oversaw a grand ceremony to rebury Edward the Confessor in a lavish new shrine, personally helping to carry the body to its new resting place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=165}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=382}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 247}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward left for the [[Eighth Crusade]], led by Louis of France, in 1270, but Henry became increasingly ill; concerns about a fresh rebellion grew and the next year the King wrote to his son asking him to return to England, but Edward did not turn back.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=166}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 252–253}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry recovered slightly and announced his renewed intention to join the crusades himself, but he never regained his full health and on the evening of 16 November 1272, he died in Westminster, probably with Eleanor in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=166}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 253}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Edward, who slowly made his way back to England via Gascony, finally arriving in August 1274.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=46, 468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleanor probably hoped that Henry would be recognised as a saint, as his contemporary Louis IX of France had been; indeed, Henry's final tomb resembled the shrine of a saint, complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 306}}; {{harvnb|Vincent|2006|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the King's body was exhumed in 1290, contemporaries noted that the body was in perfect condition and that Henry's long beard remained well preserved, which at the time was considered to be an indication of saintly purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stacey|1997|p=86}}; {{harvnb|Duffy|2003|p=79}};{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miracles began to be reported at the tomb, but Edward was sceptical about these stories.

The first histories of Henry's reign emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries, relying primarily on the accounts of medieval chroniclers, in particular writings of [[Roger of Wendover]] and [[Matthew Paris]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; These early historians, including Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]], were influenced by contemporary concerns about the roles of the Church and state, and examined the changing nature of kingship under Henry, the emergence of English nationalism during the period and what they perceived to be the malign influence of the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}; {{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[English Civil War]], historians also drew parallels between Henry's experiences and those of the deposed [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, Victorian scholars such as [[William Stubbs]], James Ramsay, and [[William Hunt (priest)|William Hunt]] sought to understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as [[Kate Norgate]]'s 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=4–5}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1900, the financial and official records from Henry's reign began to become accessible to historians, including the [[pipe rolls]], court records, correspondence and records of administration of the royal forests.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter 1990, p.5; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Frederick Tout]] made extensive use of these new sources in the 1920s, and post-war historians brought a particular focus on the finances of Henry's government, highlighting his fiscal difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=5}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This wave of research culminated in Sir [[Maurice Powicke]]'s two major biographical works on Henry, published in 1948 and 1953, which formed the established history of the King for the next three decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}; {{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry's reign did not receive much attention from historians for many years after the 1950s: no substantial biographies of Henry were written after Powicke's, and the historian John Beeler observed in the 1970s that the coverage of Henry's reign by military historians remained particularly thin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beeler|1972|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=12}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century, there was a renewed interest in 13th-century English history, resulting in the publication of various specialist works on aspects of Henry's reign, including government finance and the period of his minority.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Current historiography notes both Henry's positive and negative qualities: historian [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]] judges him to have been a decent man, who failed as a ruler because of his naivety and inability to produce realistic plans for reform, a theme echoed by Huw Ridgeway, who also notes his unworldliness and inability to manage his court, but who considers him to have been &quot;essentially a man of peace, kind and merciful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=338–340}}; {{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207–1272) |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
The chronicler Matthew Paris depicted Henry's life in a series of illustrations, which he sketched and, in some cases, water-coloured, in the margins of the ''[[Chronica majora]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1987|pp=201–207}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paris first met Henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with the King, although he disliked many of Henry's actions and the illustrations are frequently unflattering.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1987|pp=201–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry is a character in ''[[Purgatorio]]'', the second part of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (completed in 1320). The King is depicted sitting alone in [[purgatory]], to one side of other failed rulers:&lt;ref name=Fritts2008P466&gt;{{harvnb|Fritts|2008|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf I of Germany]], [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]], [[Philip III of France]] and [[Henry I of Navarre]], as well as [[Charles I of Naples]] and [[Peter III of Aragon]]. Dante's symbolic intent in depicting Henry sitting separately is unclear; possible explanations include it being a reference to England not being part of the Holy Roman Empire and/or it indicating that Dante had a favourable opinion of Henry, due to his unusual piety.&lt;ref name=Fritts2008P466/&gt; His son, Edward, is also saluted by Dante in this work (Canto VII. 132).

Henry appears in ''[[King John (play)|King John]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] as a minor character referred to as Prince Henry but within modern popular culture, Henry has a minimal presence and has not been a prominent subject of films, theatre or television.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2013|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical novels which feature him as a character include ''Longsword, Earl of Salisbury: An Historical Romance'' (1762) by [[Thomas Leland]],&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Price, ''Reinventing Liberty: Nation, Commerce and the British Historical Novel from Walpole to Scott''. Edinburgh, [[Edinburgh University Press]], 2016. {{ISBN|9781474402972}} (p.28)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Red Saint'' (1909) by [[Warwick Deeping]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Arthur Ransome Marriott|John Marriott]],  ''English history in English fiction''. London: Blackie, 1940. (p.59)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Outlaw of Torn]]'' (1927) by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], ''The De Montfort Legacy'' (1973) by Pamela Bennetts, ''The Queen from Provence'' (1979) by [[Jean Plaidy]], ''The Marriage of Meggotta'' (1979) by [[Edith Pargeter]] and ''Falls the Shadow'' (1988) by [[Sharon Kay Penman]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynda G.

{{main article|Danish slave trade}}

Trading African slaves was part of the [[transatlantic slave trade]] by [[Denmark-Norway]] around 1671, when the [[Danish West India Company]] was chartered until 1 January 1803 when the 1792 law to abolish the slave trade came into effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;goeber&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/03468755.2011.564065|title = Danish Shipping Along the Triangular Route, 1671–1802: Voyages and conditions on board| journal=Scandinavian Journal of History| volume=36| issue=2| pages=135–155|year = 2011|last1 = Gøbel|first1 = Erik|s2cid = 143440637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1778, it was estimated that the Danes were bringing about 3,000 Africans to the Danish West Indies yearly for enslavement.&lt;ref name=Kitchin1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Thomas|title=The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe|year=1778|publisher=R.

===Slave codes===

Laws and regulations in the Danish West Indies were based on Denmark's laws, but the local government was allowed to adapt them to match local conditions. For example, things like animals, land, and buildings were regulated according to Danish law, but Danish law did not regulate slavery. Slaves were treated as common property, and therefore did not necessitate specific laws.
[[File:Høgensborg, Plantation, St. Croix, Danish West Indies.jpg|thumb|The Høgensborg estate on Sankt Croix, 1833]]

In 1733, differentiation between slaves and other property was implied by a regulation that stated that slaves had their own will and thus could behave inappropriately or be disobedient. There was a general consensus that if the slaves were punished too hard or were malnourished, the slaves would start to rebel. This was borne out by the [[1733 slave insurrection on St. John]] where many plantation owners and their families were killed by the [[Akwamu]], including [[Breffu]], before it was suppressed later the following year.&lt;ref name=norton&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Estate by Estate: The Landscape of the 1733 St. Jan Slave Rebellion|author=Holly Kathryn Norton|date=2013|type=PhD|publisher=Syracuse University|page=90|id={{ProQuest|1369397993}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1755 [[Frederick V of Denmark]] issued more new Regulations, in which slaves were guaranteed the right not to be separated from their children and the right to medical support during periods of illness or old age. However, the colonial government had the ability to amend laws and regulations according to local conditions, and thus the regulations were never enacted in the colony, on grounds that it was more disadvantageous than advantageous.&lt;ref name=&quot;SurtSødt.dk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surtsoedt.dk/pages/leksikon/begivenheder/syttentreogtredve.html|title=Begivenheder: 1733|last1=Trolle Gronemann|first1=Signe|last2=Vindberg|first2=Rikke|year=2005|website=SurtSødt|language=Danish|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626111624/http://www.surtsoedt.dk/pages/leksikon/begivenheder/syttentreogtredve.html|archive-date=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1733 slave insurrection===

{{main article|1733 slave insurrection on St. John}}

The 1733 slave insurrection on St. John, which lasted from November 1733 until August 1734 was one of the earliest and longest [[slave rebellion]]s in the [[Americas]]. The insurrection started on November 23, 1733, when 150 slaves, primarily [[Akwamu]]s revolted against plantation owners and managers. The slaves captured the fort in [[Coral Bay, United States Virgin Islands|Coral Bay]] and took control of most of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sebro|first=Louise|title=The 1733 Slave Revolt on the Island of St. John: Continuity and Change from Africa to the Americas|date=2013|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-6202-6_15|work=Scandinavian Colonialism and the Rise of Modernity|series=Contributions to Global Historical Archaeology|volume=37|pages=261–274|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=978-1-4614-6201-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planters regained control by the end of May 1734, after the Akwamu were defeated by several hundred better-armed French and Swiss troops sent in April from [[Martinique]], a French colony. Colony militia continued to hunt down [[Maroon (people)|maroons]] and finally declared the rebellion at an end in late August 1734.&lt;ref name=Rebellion&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohnbeachguide.com/Slave%20Rebellion.htm |title=St. John Slave Rebellion |accessdate=July 19, 2008 |work=St. John Off the Beaten Track |publisher=Sombrero Publishing Co |year=2000| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080621205949/http://www.stjohnbeachguide.com/Slave%20Rebellion.htm| archivedate= June 21, 2008 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emancipation===
[[File:EmancipationsplakatDWI1848.jpg|thumb|Emancipation proclamation, 1848]]

By the 1830s and 1840s, the [[sugar beet]] industry had reduced the profitability of sugarcane. The [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|British Slavery Abolition Act of 1833]] [[Emancipation of the British West Indies|emancipated slaves in the neighboring British West Indies]], fully effective as of 1840. Abolition in the Danish West Indies was discussed, with [[Peter von Scholten|Governor von Scholten]], who had been seeking reforms since 1830, in favor of [[emancipation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history.dk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virgin-islands-history.dk/eng/vi_hist.asp|title=A Brief History of the Danish West Indies|publisher=Danish National Archives|accessdate=2020-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FreedomWeekProclamation&quot;&gt;{{cite executive order | number=2017-06-26 | url=http://aphj2sd.com/files/documents/2017-Virgin-Islands-Freedom-Week.pdf | title=Virgin Islands Freedom Week | date= 2017-06-26 | language=English | post=Governor of the US Virgin Islands | accessdate=2020-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly consensus suggests von Scholten's views were influenced by his free-coloured mistress Anna Heegaard.&lt;ref name=&quot;newenglishreview.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm/frm/184381/sec_id/184381|title=The Abolition of Slavery in the Danish West Indies and the Governor's Mulatto Mistress|publisher=New English Review|accessdate=2020-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stcroixlandmarks.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stcroixlandmarks.org/history/anna-heegaard/|title=Anna Heegaard, mistress of Governor General Peter von Scholten|publisher=St. Croix Landmarks Society|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200704055102/http://www.stcroixlandmarks.org/history/anna-heegaard/|accessdate=2020-07-03|archive-date=2020-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dookhan | first1 = Isaac | year = 1994 | title = A History of the Virgin Islands of the United States | location = Kingston, Jamaica | publisher = University of the West Indies | publication-date = 2006 | page = 173 | isbn = 978-976-8125-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Hall| first1 = Neville A.

[[Christian VIII of Denmark|King Christian VIII]] supported the gradual abolition of slavery and ruled in 1847 that every child born of an unfree woman should be free from birth, and that slavery would end entirely after 12 years. That ruling satisfied neither the slaves, nor the plantation owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.org1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virgin-islands-history.org/en/history/slavery/the-emancipation-of-the-enslaved-in-1848/|title=The emancipation of the enslaved in 1848|publisher=Danish National Archives|accessdate=2020-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile on April 27, 1848, France signed a law to abolish slavery in their colonies within two months, but a slave insurrection on [[History of Martinique#1815-1899|Martinique]] led to immediate abolition on Martinique on May 22 and [[Guadeloupe]] on May 27.&lt;ref name=&quot;slaveryandremembrance.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slaveryandremembrance.org/partners/partner/?id=P0054|title=Monument to Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Slavery and Remembrance|accessdate=2020-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slaves in the Danish West Indies did not want to wait for their freedom either. On July 2, 1848 freedman John Gottlieb (also known as &quot;Moses Gottlieb&quot; or &quot;General Buddhoe&quot;) and Admiral Martin King (among others) led a slave rebellion, taking over [[Frederiksted, U.S. Virgin Islands|Frederiksted]], Saint Croix.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.org2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virgin-islands-history.org/en/timeline/the-slave-rebellion-on-st-croix-and-emancipation/|title=The slave rebellion on St. Croix and Emancipation|publisher=Danish National Archives|accessdate=2020-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; That evening hundreds of slaves gathered peaceably outside [[Fort Frederik]] refusing to work the next day and demanding freedom. By 10 AM the following morning about 8000 slaves had joined.&lt;ref name=&quot;slaverebellion.info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slaverebellion.info/index.php?page=slave-resistances-in-latin-america-2|title=Slave Resistances in Latin America|publisher=African American Information Service|accessdate=2020-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FreedomStatueCruzBay.jpg|thumb|The conch blower in the &quot;Freedom Statue&quot; depicts the slaves' call to action in 1848]]

On the afternoon of July 3, 1848 (now known as [[Emancipation Day#US Virgin Islands|Emancipation Day]]), Peter von Scholten, in order to end the rebellion and prevent bloodshed and damages, went to Frederiksted and announced an immediate and total emancipation of all slaves. He then went to [[Christiansted, U.S. Virgin Islands|Christiansted]] where a second rebellion had formed and some fires had been set, and had notices disseminated to the other islands. General Buddhoe worked with the governor and other officials to end the riots and violence that had broken out on a few estates.&lt;ref name=&quot;aphj2sd.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aphj2sd.com/general-buddhoe~liberator-of-the-virgin-islands|title=General Buddhoe~Liberator of the Virgin Islands|publisher=A People's Historical Journey to Self Determination and Decolonization 2020|accessdate=2020-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath, Buddhoe is said to have been jailed and exiled to Trinidad.&lt;ref name=&quot;aphj2sd.com&quot; /&gt; Governor von Scholten also fared poorly. As governor, he did not actually have the authority to end slavery, but had found himself in a situation where he needed to take immediate action that could not wait for communicating with Denmark. For his actions, he was called back to Denmark to face a trial for treason. He was first denied his pension, but later cleared of the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bricka |first1=C.F. |title=Dansk Biografisk Lexikon |date=1901 |publisher=Gyldendal |location=Copenhagen |pages=255–256 |url=http://runeberg.org/dbl/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Denmark abolished slavery in 1848, many plantation owners wanted full reimbursement on the grounds that their assets were damaged by the loss of the slaves, and by the fact that they would have to pay for labor in the future. The Danish government paid fifty dollars for every slave the plantation owners had owned and recognized that the slaves' release had caused a financial loss for the owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;SurtSødt.dk&quot;/&gt;

===Post-slavery===

The lives of the former slaves changed very little. Most were simply hired at the plantations where they had previously worked and were offered one-year contracts, a small hut, a little land and some money as part of a [[sharecropping]] system. However, as employees, former slaves were not the plantation owners' responsibility and did not receive food or care from their employers.

On Contract Day in 1878, violence escalated into the [[1878 St. Croix labor riot|Fireburn labor riot]] after laborers in Frederiksted demanded higher wages and working conditions.

[[File:WaterTractorBeam.webm|thumbtime=36|thumb|Water Tractor Beam]]
A '''tractor beam''' is a device with the ability to attract one object to another from a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15535115 | work=BBC News | title=Nasa examines 'tractor beams' for sample gathering | date=November 1, 2011 | access-date=June 20, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416181025/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15535115 | archive-date=April 16, 2018 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept originates in fiction: the term was coined by [[E. E. Smith]] (an update of his earlier &quot;attractor beam&quot;) in his novel ''[[Spacehounds of IPC]]'' (1931).  Since the 1990s, technology and research has laboured to make it a reality, and have had some success on a microscopic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-21187598|title=Star Trek style 'tractor beam' created by scientists|publisher=BBC|date=25 January 2013|accessdate=1 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014151040/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-21187598|archive-date=14 October 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less commonly, a similar beam that repels is called a '''pressor beam''' or '''repulsor beam'''. Gravity impulse and gravity propulsion beams are traditionally areas of research from [[fringe physics]] that coincide with the concepts of tractor and repulsor beams.

==Physics==
A [[force field]] confined to a [[Collimated light|collimated beam]] with clean borders is one of the principal characteristics of tractor and repulsor beams.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://108.59.0.28/encyclopedia/index.php/Tractor_beam|title=Tractor beam, a hypothetical device|last=|first=|date=|website=Academic Kids|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 October 2019}}{{Dead link|date=August 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several theories that have predicted repulsive effects do not fall within the category of tractor and repulsor beams because of the absence of field collimation. For example, [[Robert L. Forward]], Hughes Research Laboratories, Malibu, California, showed that general relativity theory allowed the generation of a very brief impulse of a gravity-like repulsive force along the axis of a helical torus containing accelerated [[condensed matter]].&lt;ref&gt;Forward, R. L.. (1961, September 11).  Practical anti-gravity still far off.  ''Missiles and Rockets'', '''9'''(11), 28–31, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1119/1.1969340 | last1 = Forward | first1 =  Robert L.| date = 1963 | title = March. Guidelines to antigravity | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 166–170 | bibcode=1963AmJPh..31..166F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream scientific community has accepted Forward's work.  A variant of [[Burkhard Heim]]'s theory by [[Walter Dröscher]], Institut für Grenzgebiete der Wissenschaft (IGW), Innsbruck, Austria, and Jocham Häuser, University of Applied Sciences and CLE GmbH, Salzgitter, Germany, predicted a repulsive force field of gravitophotons could be produced by a ring rotating above a very strong magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;Dröscher, W., &amp; Häuser, J. (2004, July). ''Guidelines for a space propulsion device based on Heim's quantum theory'' (AIAA 2004–3700). Paper presented at the meeting of the 40th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference &amp; Exhibit, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  This work was named the 2004 AIAA Best Paper by the AIAA Nuclear and Future Flight Technical Committee.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heim’s theory, and its variants, have been treated by the mainstream scientific community as fringe physics. But the works by Forward, Dröscher, and Häuser could not be considered as a form of repulsor or tractor beam because the predicted impulses and field effects were not confined to a well defined, collimated region.

The following are a summary of experiments and theories that resemble repulsor and tractor beam concepts:

===1960s===
In July 1960, ''Missiles and Rockets'' reported Martin N. Kaplan, Senior Research Engineer, Electronics Division, Ryan Aeronautical Company, San Diego, had conducted experiments that justified planning for a more comprehensive research program.  The article indicated such a program, if successful, would yield either “restricted” or “general” results.  It described the “restricted” results as an ability to direct an anti-gravitational force towards or away from a second body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Force&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Force | date = 1960 | title = July 11 | journal = Missiles and Rockets | volume = 7 | issue = 2| page = 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Copenhagen physicists, L. Halpern, Universitetets Institut for Teoretisk Fysik, and B. Laurent, Nordisk Institut for Teoretisk Atomfysik, indicated general relativity theory and quantum theory allowed the generation and amplification of [[gravitons]] in a manner like the LASER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Halpern | first1 = L. | last2 = Laurent | first2 = B. | date = 1964 | title = Agosto. On the gravitational radiation of microscopic systems | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento | volume = XXXIII | issue = 3| pages = 728–751 | doi=10.1007/bf02749891| bibcode = 1964NCim...33..728H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They showed, in principle, gravitational radiation in the form of a beam of [[graviton]]s could be generated and amplified by using induced, resonant emissions.

===1990s===
In 1992, Russian Professor of Chemistry, [[Yevgeny Podkletnov]], and Nieminen, [[Tampere University of Technology]], Tampere, Finland, discovered weight fluctuations in objects above an electromagnetically levitated, massive, composite superconducting disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0921-4534(92)90055-H | last1 = Podkletnov | first1 = E. | last2 = Nieminen | first2 = R. | date = 1992 | title = A possibility of gravitational force shielding by bulk YBa2Cu3O7-x superconductor | journal = Physica C | volume = 203 | issue = 3–4| pages = 441–444 |bibcode = 1992PhyC..203..441P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three years later, Podkletnov reported the results of additional experiments with a toroidal disk superconductor.&lt;ref&gt;Podkletnov, E. E. (1995, January).  Weak gravitational shielding properties of composite bulk YBa2Cu3O7-x superconductor below 70 K under e.m. field [Report MSU-chem 95]. Moscow, Russia: Moscow Chemical Scientific Research Centre.  Also, LANL Physics Preprint Server, arXiv: cond-mat/9701074v3.&lt;/ref&gt;  They reported the weight of the samples would fluctuate between −2.5% and +5.4% as the angular speed of the superconductor increased.  Certain combinations of disk angular speeds and electromagnetic frequencies caused the fluctuations to stabilize at a 0.3% reduction.  The experiments with the toroidal disk yielded reductions that reached a maximum of 1.9–2.1%.  Reports about both sets of experiments stated the weight loss region was cylindrical, extending vertically for at least three meters above the disk.  Qualitative observations of an expulsive force at the border of the shielded zone were reported in the Fall of 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congress&quot;&gt;Modanese, G. (1997).  Updating the theoretical analysis of the weak gravitational shielding experiments.  ''Proceedings of the 1997 IAF Congress'', nr. IAA-97-4.107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian physicist Giovanni Modanese, while a Von Humboldt Fellow at the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]], made the first attempt to provide a theoretical explanation of Podkletnov's observations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congress&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Modanese | first1 = G | year = 1996 | title = Theoretical analysis of a reported weak-gravitational-shielding effect | url = | journal = Europhysics Letters | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 413–418 |arxiv=hep-th/9505094 | doi=10.1209/epl/i1996-00129-8| bibcode = 1996EL.....35..413M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued the shielding effect and slight expulsive force at the border of the shielded zone could be explained in terms of induced changes in the local [[cosmological constant]].  Modanese described several effects in terms of responses to modifications to the local cosmological constant within the superconductor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Modanese | first1 = G | year = 1996 | title = Role of a &quot;local&quot; cosmological constant in Euclidean quantum gravity | url = | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 54 | issue = 8| pages = 5002–5009 |arxiv=hep-th/9601160 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.54.5002| pmid = 10021190 | bibcode = 1996PhRvD..54.5002M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ning Wu, Institute of High Energy Physics, Beijing, China, used the quantum gauge theory of gravity he had developed in 2001 to explain Podkletnov's observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = N | year = 2004 | title = Gravitational shielding effects in gauge theory of gravity | url = | journal = Communications in Theoretical Physics | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 567–572 |arxiv=hep-th/0307225 | doi=10.1088/0253-6102/41/4/567| bibcode = 2004CoTPh..41..567W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wu's theory approximated the relative gravity loss as 0.03% (an order of magnitude smaller than the reported range of 0.3 – 0.5%).

Several groups around the world tried to replicate Podkletnov's gravity shielding observations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0376-0421(02)00049-0 | last1 = Allen | first1 = J.

Clive Woods, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [[Iowa State University]], those groups were not able to overcome the extremely challenging technical problems of replicating all aspects of the 1992 experimental conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woods&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woods | first1 = R. C. | date = 2004 | title = Review of claims of interaction between gravitation and high-temperature superconductors | journal = AIP Conference Proceedings | volume = 669 | issue = 1| pages = 1085–1092 | doi = 10.1063/1.1649676| bibcode = 2004AIPC..699.1085W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Woods summarised those shortcomings in the following list:

:* Use of a superconductor disk with a diameter greater than 100 mm;
:* A disk containing ~30% non-superconducting YBCO, preferable organised into two layers;
:* A disk capable of self-levitation, but still containing large numbers of inter-grain junctions;
:* An AC levitation field with a frequency of ~10 kHz;
:* A second excitation field with a frequency of ~1 MHz, for disk rotation; and
:* Disk rotation speeds of 3,000 rpm or greater for large (&gt;0.05%) gravitational effects.

C. S. Unnikrishan, [[TIFR|Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, India]], showed that if the effect had been caused by gravitational shielding, the shape of the shielded region would be similar to a shadow from the gravitational shield.  For example, the shape of the shielded region above a disk would be conical.  The height of the cone's apex above the disk would vary directly with the height of the shielding disk above the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0921-4534(96)00340-1 | last1 = Unnikrishan | first1 = C.

That factor and others precipitated a recommendation to reclassify the effect as gravitational modification instead of gravitational shielding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woods&quot;/&gt;  Such a reclassification means the region causing the weight modifications can be directed and is not limited to the space above the superconductor.

===2010s===
A team of scientists at the Australian National University led by Professor Andrei Rode created a device similar to a tractor beam to move small particles 1.5 meters through the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shvedov|first=Vladlen|author2=A.

This method confines particles to the centre of the beam using [[photophoresis]], whereby illuminated sections of the particle have a higher temperature and thus impart more momentum to air molecules incident on the surface.  Owing to this method, it is impossible for such a device to work in space due to lack of air, but Professor Rode states that there are practical applications for the device on Earth such as, for example, the transportation of microscopic hazardous materials and other microscopic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smart|first=Ashley|title=Optical manipulation of light – absorbing particles takes to the air|journal=Physics Today|date=November 2010|volume=63|issue=11|pages=13–14|doi=10.1063/1.3518265|bibcode=2010PhT....63k..13S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aussiescientists&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =McDaniel | first =Tracie | title =Aussie Scientists Have New &quot;Pull&quot; as Tractor Beam Goes the Distance | work =[[Daily Tech]] | date =September 9, 2010 | url =http://www.dailytech.com/Aussie+Scientists+Have+New+Pull+as+Tractor+Beam+Goes+the+Distance/article19583.htm | accessdate =2010-09-09 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100913022948/http://www.dailytech.com/Aussie+Scientists+Have+New+Pull+as+Tractor+Beam+Goes+the+Distance/article19583.htm | archive-date =2010-09-13 | url-status =dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Chinese scientists posited that a specific type of [[Bessel beam]] (a special kind of laser that does not diffract at the centre) is capable of creating a pull-like effect on a given microscopic particle, forcing it towards the beam source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Chris Gayomali | title = Tractor Beam Lasers?

They show explicitly that the necessary condition to realize a negative (pulling) optical force is the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle and if the projection of the total photon momentum along the propagation direction is small, attractive optical force is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Backward Pulling Force from a Forward Propagating Beam   | journal = Nature Photonics | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 531 | date = 24 February 2011 | author1 = Jun Chen | author2 = Jack Ng | author3 = Zhifang Lin | author4 = C.

Functioning tractor beams based on solenoidal modes of light were demonstrated in 2010 by physicists at [[New York University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LeeRoichman2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Sang-Hyuk|last2=Roichman|first2=Yohai|last3=Grier|first3=David G.|title=Optical solenoid beams|journal=Optics Express|volume=18|issue=7|pages=6988–93|date=2010|issn=1094-4087|doi=10.1364/OE.18.006988|pmid=20389718|bibcode=2010OExpr..18.6988L}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The spiraling intensity distribution in these non-diffracting beams tends to trap illuminated objects and thus helps to 
overcome the radiation pressure that ordinarily would drive them down the optical axis.  
[[Orbital angular momentum of light|Orbital angular momentum]] transferred from the solenoid beam's helical wavefronts then 
drives the trapped objects upstream along the spiral.  Both Bessel-beam and solenoidal tractor beams are being considered for 
applications in space exploration by [[NASA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nasa examines 'tractor beams' for sample gathering | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15535115 | date = 1 November 2011 | accessdate = 2012-09-21 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130126053916/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15535115 | archive-date = 26 January 2013 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, scientists at the Institute of Scientific Instruments (ISI) and the university of St Andrews succeeded in creating a tractor beam that pulls objects on a microscopic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Star-Trek style tractor beam created by scientists | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-21187598 | date=25 January 2013 | access-date=20 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820231155/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-21187598 | archive-date=20 August 2018 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new study states that while this technique is new, it may have potential for bio-medical research. 
Professor Zemanek said: “The whole team have spent a number of years investigating various configurations of particles delivery by light. 
Dr Brzobohaty said: “These methods are opening new opportunities for fundamental photonics as well as applications for life-sciences.”
Dr Cizmar said: “Because of the similarities between optical and acoustic particle manipulation we anticipate that this concept will provide inspiration for exciting future studies in areas outside the field of photonics.”

In 2018, a research team from Tel-Aviv University led by Dr. Alon Bahabad experimentally demonstrated an optical analog of the famous Archimedes’ screw where the rotation of a helical-intensity laser beam is transferred to the axial motion of optically trapped micrometer-scale, airborne, carbon-based particles. With this optical screw, particles were easily conveyed with controlled velocity and direction, upstream or downstream of the optical flow, over a distance of half a centimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hadad|first1=Barak|last2=Froim|first2=Sahar|last3=Nagar|first3=Harel|last4=Admon|first4=Tamir|last5=Eliezer|first5=Yaniv|last6=Roichman|first6=Yael|last7=Bahabad|first7=Alon|title=Particle trapping and conveying using an optical Archimedes' screw|journal=Optica|date=2 May 2018|volume=5|issue=5|pages=551–556|doi=10.1364/OPTICA.5.000551|language=EN|issn=2334-2536|arxiv=1706.10122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
[[Science fiction]] movies and telecasts normally depict tractor and repulsor beams as audible, narrow rays of visible light that cover a small area of a target. Tractor beams are most commonly used on [[Spacecraft|spaceships]] and [[space stations]]. They are generally used in three ways:
# As a device for securing or retrieving cargo, passengers, shuttlecraft, etc. This is analogous to [[crane (machine)|crane]]s on modern [[ship]]s.
# As a device to harness objects that can then be used as improptu weapons by the craft
# As a means of preventing an enemy from escaping, analogous to [[grappling hook]]s.

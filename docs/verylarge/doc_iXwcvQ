===International===
* The series was broadcast by [[BBC One|BBC1]] in the United Kingdom, debuting on Saturday March 3, 1979 at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (just several months after it began in the U.S.) Popular with all ages (and as some of the more adult elements of very early episodes faded out of the series), it quickly moved from its post-[[Watershed (broadcasting)#United Kingdom|watershed]] position to a more family-friendly Monday evening slot at 7:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. Soon a massive hit, it moved from Monday evenings to prime-time Saturday evening (times varied, but typically around 5:25&amp;nbsp;p.m.), where it stayed for a number of years. Later when ratings began to dip (partly caused by the change to Coy and Vance, and partly to do with competition from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], with new hit shows such as ''[[The A-Team]]''), it moved back to Mondays, making the odd return for short runs on Saturdays. Late episodes also popped up occasionally on Sunday afternoons, and the remaining episodes of the final season were broadcast on weekday mornings during school holidays in the late 1980s.
* In 1992, U.K. satellite channel [[Sky1]] bought a package of the program, owning the rights to the first 60 episodes produced (running up to &quot;The Fugitive&quot;), showing the series on Saturday afternoons at 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. They later showed the episodes they owned again, including a stint showing it in a weekday 3&amp;nbsp;p.m. slot, running for 50 minutes (including commercials) with the episodes heavily edited for time as a result, often leaving gaps in the plot. Despite requests from fans, they did not secure the rights to later episodes. The series was later run on the satellite channels [[Plus (British TV channel)|Granada Plus]] and [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]]. U.K. satellite channel [[Bravo (British TV channel)|Bravo]] began airing reruns in August 2005. Reruns are currently shown on [[Forces TV]].
* In Brazil, the series was named ''Os Gatões'' (''The Big Hunks''), which limited its popularity among the male audience.
* The series was also shown in the Netherlands by Dutch broadcasting organization [[Algemene Vereniging Radio Omroep|AVRO]], with Dutch subtitles, rather than being dubbed.
* It was shown on [[Nine Network]] in Australia from September 1979 until the end of the series, and repeated throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. It was quietly rerun on [[Pay television|pay TV]] channel [[TV1 (Australia)|TV1]] in the 2000s, but is now shown on Nine Network's subchannel, [[9Go!|Go!]].
* The series aired weekdays on New Zealand's channel [[Sky 5|The BOX]]. Previously it aired on [[TVNZ]] for its original run, being repeated on Saturday afternoons in the early 1990s.
* The series was popular in [[Colombia]], dubbed into Spanish. Some late-night reruns continue to the present day.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}
* In Italy, the series started to air in September 1981 on [[Canale 5]], under the title ''Hazzard'' and quickly became popular with the viewers.

==Spin-offs==
* A spin-off named ''[[Enos (TV series)|Enos]]'' aired on CBS starring [[Sonny Shroyer]] and lasted 18 episodes before being cancelled.
* An animated version of the show called ''[[The Dukes (TV series)|The Dukes]]'' aired in 1983 and produced by Hanna-Barbera. The first season fell under the Coy and Vance era of the live-action show and thus they were adapted into animated form. By the second season, Bo and Luke had returned, and they replaced Coy and Vance in the cartoon.
* Several video games based on the show were created:
** ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (video game)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' for [[ColecoVision]] (1984) and [[ZX Spectrum]] (1985); also planned for the [[Atari 2600]]
** ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard: Racing for Home]]'' (1999)
** ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard II: Daisy Dukes It Out]]'' (2000)
** ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard: Return of the General Lee]]'' (2004)
* In 2005, the [[Humana Festival of New American Plays]] premiered a full-length comedy-drama entitled ''[[Hazzard County (play)|Hazzard County]]'' by [[Allison Moore]]. The story centers on a young widowed mother and a visit she receives from a big city television producer. Interspersed with recollections of Bo, Luke, and Daisy, the play takes a deep look at southern &quot;good ol' boy&quot; culture and its popularization through the lens of American mass media.
* In 2014, AutoTrader made a commercial where Bo and Luke shop for a new car while being chased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/dukes-hazzard-ride-again-autotraders-high-octane-campaign-158537/|title=The Dukes of Hazzard Ride Again in AutoTrader's High-Octane Campaign|work=AdWeek|access-date=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901033503/http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/dukes-hazzard-ride-again-autotraders-high-octane-campaign-158537/|archive-date=September 1, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV movies==
There were two made-for-TV reunion movies that aired on CBS, ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion!]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard: Hazzard in Hollywood]]'' (2000).

==Films==
Also made were ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' in 2005 and a direct-to-video prequel ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Eastbound-Down-Jody-Hill-May-Reboot-Dukes-Hazzard-Warner-Bros-30735.html|title=East &amp; Down's Jody Hill May Reboot Dukes of Hazard At Warner Bros.|publisher=CinemaBlend|access-date=May 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505210218/https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Eastbound-Down-Jody-Hill-May-Reboot-Dukes-Hazzard-Warner-Bros-30735.html|archive-date=May 5, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; These films were in the [[buddy film|buddy]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[Road movie|road film]] in tone than compared to how the original TV series itself was an action-comedy.

==Home media==

==Legacy and influence in popular culture==
In 2005, Tom Wopat and John Schneider were reunited during &quot;Exposed&quot;, a [[Smallville (season 5)|fifth-season]] episode of the television series ''[[Smallville]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;smallville&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Exposed |series=Smallville |series-link=Smallville |credits=Kelly Souders &amp; [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]] (writers); [[Jeannot Szwarc]] (director) |network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]] |airdate=November 3, 2005 |season=5 |number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wopat guest-starred as [[Kansas Senate|Kansas State Senator]] Jack Jennings, an old friend of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]'s adoptive father [[Characters of Smallville#Jonathan Kent|Jonathan Kent]] (portrayed by Schneider). In the episode, Jennings drives a 1969 Dodge Charger—the same body style as the ''General Lee''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2005/11/03/the-dukes-of-smallville-are-on-tonight/ |title='The Dukes' of Smallville are on Tonight |author=Sloan, Sam |date=November 3, 2005 |publisher=[[Slice of SciFi]] |access-date=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605200535/http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2005/11/03/the-dukes-of-smallville-are-on-tonight/ |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daisy Duke was almost always dressed in very short jean shorts. That style of shorts became known as &quot;Daisy Dukes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.dictionary.com/e/fashion/jorts/|title=Dictionary.com definition 'jorts' |access-date=September 28, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Lizard Lick Towing]]'' featured an episode with its repossession specialists Ronnie Shirley and Bobby Brantley repossessing a ''General Lee'' replica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dave.uktv.co.uk/lizard-lick-towing/gallery/lizard-licks-most-ridiculous-repos/|title=Lizard Lick's most ridiculous repos {{!}} Lizard Lick Towing {{!}} Dave Channel|website=dave.uktv.co.uk|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confederate flag controversy ===
After the 2015 [[Charleston church shooting]], renewed debate about the symbolism of the Confederate battle flag (which was prominently featured on the ''General Lee''{{'}}s roof, and panel behind the rear window in the first five episodes) prompted [[TV Land]] to pull reruns of the original series.&lt;ref name=&quot;amazon_considers_fox&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/amazon-considers-removing-dukes-of-hazzard-racial-tensions |title=Amazon considers removing 'Dukes of Hazzard' from its streaming library over Confederate flag: report |access-date=July 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200630012515/https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/amazon-considers-removing-dukes-of-hazzard-racial-tensions |archive-date=June 30, 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros., which owns the property, announced it would also no longer create merchandise bearing the flag, including miniatures of the ''General Lee'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2015/07/01/confederate-flag-gets-dukes-of-hazzard-yanked-from-tv-land/29571785/ |title=Confederate flag gets 'Dukes of Hazzard' yanked |date=July 1, 2015 |work=USA TODAY |access-date=September 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711192544/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2015/07/01/confederate-flag-gets-dukes-of-hazzard-yanked-from-tv-land/29571785/ |archive-date=July 11, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this has led to people making their own custom ''General Lee''s and selling them.  During the 2020 [[George Floyd protests]], Amazon reportedly considered removing the program from its streaming service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-12/amazon-considers-pulling-dukes-of-hazzard-from-video-service |title=Amazon Considers Pulling ‘Dukes of Hazzard’ From Video Service |access-date=July 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705165543/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-12/amazon-considers-pulling-dukes-of-hazzard-from-video-service |archive-date=July 5, 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hubble's law''', also known as the '''Hubble–Lemaître law''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |date=29 October 2018 |title=IAU members vote to recommend renaming the Hubble law as the Hubble–Lemaître law |url=https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1812/?lang |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the observation in [[physical cosmology]] that [[galaxies]] are moving away from the Earth at speeds proportional to their distance. In other words, the farther they are the faster they are moving away from Earth. The velocity of the galaxies has been determined by their [[redshift]], a shift of the [[light]] they emit to the red end of the spectrum.

Hubble's law is considered the first observational basis for the [[expansion of the universe]], and today it serves as one of the pieces of evidence most often cited in support of the [[Big Bang]] model.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20170220&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |author-link=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coles&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often expressed by the equation {{nowrap|''v'' {{=}} ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''D''}}, with ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the constant of proportionality—'''Hubble constant'''—between the &quot;proper distance&quot; ''D'' to a galaxy, which can change over time, unlike the [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving distance]], and its speed of separation ''v'', i.e. the [[derivative]] of proper distance with respect to [[Chronology of the universe|cosmological time]] coordinate. (See ''[[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|uses of the proper distance]]'' for some discussion of the subtleties of this definition of 'velocity'.)

Hubble constant is most frequently quoted in ([[kilometre|km]]/[[second|s]])/[[Parsec#Megaparsecs and gigaparsecs|Mpc]], thus giving the speed in km/s of a galaxy {{convert|1|Mpc|km|sigfig=3}} away, and its value is about {{nobr|70 (km/s)/Mpc}}.  However, the SI unit of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is simply s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the SI unit for the reciprocal of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is simply the second. The reciprocal of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the [[#Hubble time|Hubble time]]. The Hubble constant can also be interpreted as the relative rate of expansion. In this form H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 7%/Gyr, meaning that at the current rate of expansion it takes a billion years for an unbound structure to grow by 7%.

A decade before Hubble made his observations, a number of [[physicists]] and [[mathematician]]s had established a consistent theory of an expanding universe by using [[Einstein's field equations]] of [[general relativity]]. Applying the most [[Cosmological principle|general principles]] to the nature of the [[universe]] yielded a [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] solution that conflicted with the then-prevalent notion of a [[static universe]].

===Slipher's observations===
In 1912, [[Vesto Slipher]] measured the first [[Doppler shift]] of a &quot;[[spiral nebula]]&quot; (the obsolete term for spiral galaxies) and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was [[Shapley–Curtis debate|highly controversial]] whether or not these [[nebulae]] were &quot;island universes&quot; outside our Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parameter used by Friedmann is known today as the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] and can be considered as a [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] form of the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality constant]] of Hubble's law. [[Georges Lemaître]] independently found a similar solution in his 1927 paper discussed in the following section. The Friedmann equations are derived by inserting the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|metric for a homogeneous and isotropic universe]] into Einstein's field equations for a fluid with a given [[density]] and [[pressure]]. This idea of an expanding spacetime would eventually lead to the [[Big Bang]] and [[Steady State Theory|Steady State]] theories of cosmology.

===Lemaître's equation===
In 1927, two years before Hubble published his own article, the Belgian priest and astronomer [[Georges Lemaître]] was the first to publish research deriving what is now known as Hubble's law. According to the Canadian astronomer [[Sidney van den Bergh]], &quot;the 1927 discovery of the expansion of the universe by Lemaître was published in French in a low-impact journal. In the 1931 high-impact English translation of this article, a critical equation was changed by omitting reference to what is now known as the Hubble constant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van den Bergh|first1=Sydney|title=The Curious Case of Lemaître's Equation No. 24|journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada|volume=105|issue=4|pages=151|arxiv=1106.1195|year=2011|bibcode=2011JRASC.105..151V}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that the alterations in the translated paper were carried out by Lemaître himself.&lt;ref name = Livio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=David|title='Georges Lemaitre and Stigler's law of eponymy' in Georges Lemaître: Life, Science and Legacy|date=2012|publisher=Springer|pages=89–96|edition=Holder and Mitton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shape of the universe===
Before the advent of [[Big Bang|modern cosmology]], there was considerable talk about the size and [[shape of the universe]]. In 1920, the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Shapley–Curtis debate]] took place between [[Harlow Shapley]] and [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber D. Curtis]] over this issue. Shapley argued for a small universe the size of the Milky Way galaxy, and Curtis argued that the universe was much larger. The issue was resolved in the coming decade with Hubble's improved observations.

===Cepheid variable stars outside of the Milky Way===
Edwin Hubble did most of his professional astronomical observing work at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], home to the world's most powerful telescope at the time. His observations of [[Cepheid variable]] stars in “''spiral [[nebula]]e''” enabled him to calculate the distances to these objects. Surprisingly, these objects were discovered to be at distances which placed them well outside the Milky Way. They continued to be called ''nebulae'', and it was only gradually that the term ''galaxies'' replaced it.

===Combining redshifts with distance measurements===

The parameters that appear in Hubble's law, velocities and distances, are not directly measured. In reality we determine, say, a supernova brightness, which provides information about its distance, and the [[redshift]] ''z'' = ∆''λ''/''λ'' of its spectrum of radiation. Hubble correlated brightness and parameter ''z''.

Combining his measurements of galaxy distances with Vesto Slipher and [[Milton Humason]]'s measurements of the redshifts associated with the galaxies, Hubble discovered a rough proportionality between redshift of an object and its distance. Though there was considerable [[variance|scatter]] (now known to be caused by [[peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]]—the 'Hubble flow' is used to refer to the region of space far enough out that the recession velocity is larger than local peculiar velocities), Hubble was able to plot a trend line from the 46 galaxies he studied and obtain a value for the Hubble constant of 500&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc (much higher than the currently accepted value due to errors in his distance calibrations; see [[cosmic distance ladder]] for details).

At the time of discovery and development of Hubble's law, it was acceptable to explain redshift phenomenon as a Doppler shift in the context of special relativity, and use the Doppler formula to associate redshift ''z'' with velocity. Today, in the context of general relativity, velocity between distant objects depends on the choice of coordinates used, and therefore, the redshift can be equally described as a Doppler shift or a cosmological shift (or gravitational) due to the expanding space, or some combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;

===Cosmological constant abandoned===
{{main|Cosmological constant}}
After Hubble's discovery was published, [[Albert Einstein]] abandoned his work on the [[cosmological constant]], which he had designed to modify his equations of general relativity to allow them to produce a static solution, which he thought was the correct state of the universe. The Einstein equations in their simplest form model generally either an expanding or contracting universe, so Einstein's cosmological constant was artificially created to counter the expansion or contraction to get a perfect static and flat universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;mapcc&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hubble's discovery that the universe was, in fact, expanding, Einstein called his faulty assumption that the universe is static his &quot;biggest mistake&quot;.&lt;ref name=mapcc /&gt; On its own, general relativity could predict the expansion of the universe, which (through [[Tests of general relativity|observations]] such as the [[Gravitational lens|bending of light by large masses]], or the [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|precession of the orbit of Mercury]]) could be experimentally observed and compared to his theoretical calculations using particular solutions of the equations he had originally formulated.

In 1931, Einstein made a trip to Mount Wilson Observatory to thank Hubble for providing the observational basis for modern cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;

The discovery of the linear relationship between redshift and distance, coupled with a supposed linear relation between [[recessional velocity]] and redshift, yields a straightforward mathematical expression for Hubble's law as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;v = H_0 \, D&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the recessional velocity, typically expressed in km/s.
* ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is Hubble's constant and corresponds to the value of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (often termed the '''Hubble parameter''' which is a value that is [[time-variant system|time dependent]] and which can be expressed in terms of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]]) in the Friedmann equations taken at the time of observation denoted by the subscript ''0''. This value is the same throughout the universe for a given [[comoving time#Comoving coordinates|comoving time]].
* &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the [[comoving distance]], which is constant) from the [[galaxy]] to the observer, measured in [[mega-|mega]] [[parsec]]s (Mpc), in the 3-space defined by given [[cosmological time]]. (Recession velocity is just ''v'' = ''dD/dt'').

Hubble's law is considered a fundamental relation between recessional velocity and distance. However, the relation between recessional velocity and redshift depends on the cosmological model adopted and is not established except for small redshifts.

For distances ''D'' larger than the radius of the [[Hubble sphere]] ''r''&lt;sub&gt;HS&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;, objects recede at a rate faster than the [[speed of light]] (''See'' [[Comoving distance#Uses of the proper distance|Uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion of the significance of this):

:&lt;math&gt;r_{HS} = \frac{c}{H_0} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Since the Hubble &quot;constant&quot; is a constant only in space, not in time, the radius of the Hubble sphere may increase or decrease over various time intervals. The subscript '0' indicates the value of the Hubble constant today.&lt;ref name=Keel/&gt; Current evidence suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (''see'' [[Accelerating universe]]), meaning that for any given galaxy, the recession velocity dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances; however, the Hubble parameter is actually thought to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some ''fixed'' distance D and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575|website=Ask an Astronomer at Cornell University|access-date=5 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031123150109/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575|archive-date=23 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

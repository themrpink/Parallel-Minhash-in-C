Simon spread a rumour that Warwick had actually escaped from the Tower and was under his guardianship. He gained some support from [[Yorkist]]s.  He took Simnel to [[Ireland]] where there was still support for the Yorkist cause, and presented him to the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland|head of the Irish government]], the [[Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare|Earl of Kildare]]. Kildare was willing to support the story and invade England to overthrow King Henry. Simnel was paraded through the streets, carried on the shoulders of &quot;the tallest man of the time&quot;, an individual called D'Arcy of Platten.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, Christopher, ''The Last Knight Errant: Edward Woodville and the Age of Chivalry'', IB Tauris, 2009, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Coronation&quot;===
On 24 May 1487, Simnel was crowned in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] in [[Dublin]] as &quot;King Edward VI&quot; but this regnal number was written later when the official story had taken hold.&lt;ref&gt;Kilfeather, Siobhán, ''Dublin: A Cultural History'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He was about 10 years old. Lord Kildare collected an army of Irish soldiers under the command of his younger brother, [[Thomas FitzGerald of Laccagh]].

[[John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln]], formerly the designated successor of his uncle the late [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]], joined the conspiracy against Henry VII. He fled to [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], where Warwick's aunt [[Margaret of York]], the [[Duke of Burgundy|Dowager Duchess of Burgundy]], kept her court. Lincoln claimed that he had taken part in young Warwick's supposed escape. He also met [[Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell|Viscount Lovell]], who had supported a [[Stafford and Lovell Rebellion|failed Yorkist uprising in 1486]]. Margaret collected 2,000 Flemish mercenaries and shipped them to Ireland under the command of [[Martin Schwartz (mercenary)|Martin Schwartz]], a noted military leader of the time. They arrived in Ireland on 5 May. King Henry was informed of this and began to gather troops.

===Battle of Stoke Field===
{{main|Battle of Stoke Field}}
Simnel's army—mainly [[Flanders|Flemish]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] troops—landed on [[Piel Island]] in the [[Furness]] area of [[Lancashire]] on 5 June 1487 and were joined by some English supporters. However, most local nobles, with the exception of Sir Thomas Broughton, did not join them. They clashed with the King's army on 16 June at the [[Battle of Stoke Field]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], and were defeated. Lincoln and Thomas FitzGerald were killed. Lovell went missing; there were rumours that he had escaped to Scotland with Sir Thomas Broughton and hidden to avoid retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Horrox, Rosemary. &quot;Lovell, Francis&quot;. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (online ed.). Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Simons avoided execution due to his priestly status, but was imprisoned for life. Kildare, who had remained in Ireland, was pardoned.

==Later life==
King Henry pardoned young Simnel (probably because he recognised that Simnel had merely been a puppet in the hands of adults) and put him to work in the royal kitchen as a [[Roasting jack|spit-turner]]. When he grew older, he became a [[falconry|falconer]]. Almost no information about his later life is known. He died some time between 1525 and 1535. He seems to have married, as he is probably the father of Richard Simnel, a canon of [[St Osyth's Priory]] in Essex during the reign of Henry VIII.&lt;ref name = &quot;ali&quot;&gt;Weir, Alison, ''The Princes in the Tower'', Vintage, 2008, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural depictions==
In the 1972 [[BBC]] serial ''[[The Shadow of the Tower]]'', Simnel was portrayed by [[Gary Warren (actor)|Gary Warren]].

In 1996, [[Blyth Power]]'s album ''Out From Under the King'' included a song, ''Lambert Simnel''.

In 2006 [[Steeleye Span]]'s album ''[[Bloody Men]]'' included a song, ''The Story of the Scullion King'', about Simnel.

In the 2017 [[Starz]] miniseries ''[[The White Princess]]'', Simnel is portrayed by Max True.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The White Princess|url=https://screammanagement.com/max-true-starz-in-the-white-princess/|website=Scream Management|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 children's book ''The Player King'', by [[Avi (author)|Avi]], offers a fictionalized first-person account of the key period of Simnel's life.&lt;ref&gt;Avi, ''The Player King'', Atheneum Books, 2017, {{ISBN|978-1481437684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Photios I''' ({{lang-el|Φώτιος}}, ''Phōtios''; c. 810/820 – 6 February 893), {{cref|a}} also spelled '''Photius'''&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Fr. Justin Taylor, essay &quot;Canon Law in the Age of the Fathers&quot; (published in Jordan Hite, T.O.R., &amp; Daniel J. Ward, O.S.B., &quot;Readings, Cases, Materials in Canon Law: A Textbook for Ministerial Students, Revised Edition&quot; [Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical Press, 1990]), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|oʊ|ʃ|ə|s}}) or '''Fotios''', was the [[ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople]] from 858 to 867 and from 877 to 886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.photius.com/photios/photios15.html |title= The Life of Patriarch Photios |work=Patriarch Photios of Constantinople, His Life, Scholarly Contributions, and Correspondence, Together with a Translation of Fifty-two of His Letters | first =Despina Stratoudaki | last = White |year= 1981 |isbn=978-0-91658626-3 |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is recognized in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] as '''Saint Photios the Great'''.

Photios is widely regarded as the most powerful and influential church leader of Constantinople subsequent to [[John Chrysostom]]'s archbishopric around the turn of the fifth century. He is also viewed as the most important intellectual of his time – &quot;the leading light of the ninth-century renaissance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Louth|2007|loc=Chapter Seven: &quot;Renaissance of Learning: East and West&quot;, p. 159}}; {{harvnb|Mango|1980|p=168}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a central figure in both the [[Christianization of Bulgaria|conversion of the Slavs to Christianity]] and the [[Photian schism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1983|p=1100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered &quot;[t]he great systematic compiler of the Eastern Church, who occupies a similar position to that of [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] in the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|West]],&quot;  and whose &quot;[[nomocanon|collection]] in two parts...formed and still forms the classic source of ancient [[canon law|Church Law]] for the Greek Church.&quot;&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

Photios was a well-educated man from a noble Constantinopolitan family. Photius's great uncle was a previous patriarch of Constantinople, [[Tarasios of Constantinople|Saint Tarasius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1987|loc=Chapter Thirteen: &quot;Ignatius, Photius, and Pope Nicholas I&quot;, p. 168}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to be a monk, but chose to be a scholar and statesman instead. In 858, Emperor [[Michael III]] (r. 842–867) decided to confine Patriarch [[Ignatios of Constantinople|Ignatius]] in order to force him into resignation, and Photios, still a layman, was appointed to replace him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=&quot;Photius&quot;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Amid power struggles between the pope and the Byzantine emperor, Ignatius was reinstated. Photios resumed the position when Ignatius died (877), by order of the Byzantine emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; The new pope, [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]], approved Photios's reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Durant|1972|p=529}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics regard as legitimate a [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)]] anathematizing Photios,&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; while Eastern Orthodox regard as legitimate a subsequent [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)]], reversing the former.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; The contested councils mark the end of unity represented by the [[first seven Ecumenical Councils]].

Studies show that Photios was venerated as a saint as early as the 9th century, and by the Roman Church as late as the 12th century.&lt;ref name=early_veneration&gt;И. Византийский. ''Святѣйшій Фотій, патріархъ Константинопольскій (The Most Holy Photius, Patriarch of Constantinople)'' // «Церковныя Вѣдомости, издаваемыя при Святѣйшемъ Правительствующемъ Сѵнодѣ» («Ecclesiastical leaflets of the Most Holy Governing Synod»). 29 January 1900, № 5, pages 193—201.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Photios was formally canonized by the Orthodox Church in 1847.

==Secular life==
Most of the primary sources treating Photios's life are written by persons hostile to him. Modern scholars are thus cautious when assessing the accuracy of the information these sources provide.{{cref|b}} Little is known of Photios's origin and early years. It is known that he was born into a notable family and that his uncle Saint Tarasius had been the patriarch of Constantinople from 784&amp;ndash;806 under both Empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]] (r. 797–802) and Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (r. 802–811).&lt;ref&gt;Photios. ''Epistola II'', CII, 609; {{harvnb|Tougher|1997|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the second [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|Iconoclasm]], which began in 814, his family suffered persecution since his father, Sergios, was a prominent [[iconophile]]. Sergios's family returned to favor only after the restoration of the icons in 842.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tougher|1997|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain scholars assert that Photios was, at least in part, of [[Armenians|Armenian]] descent{{cref|c}} while other scholars merely refer to him as a &quot;[[Byzantine Greeks|Greek Byzantine]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gren|2002|p=110}}: &quot;Something of it, though, has been saved for posterity in the extracts made later by the Greek Byzantine patriarch Photios...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine writers also report that Emperor [[Michael III]] (r. 842–867) once angrily called Photios &quot;[[Khazar]]-faced&quot;, but whether this was a generic insult or a reference to his [[ethnicity]] is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1954|p=194}}; {{harvnb|Fortescue|2001|loc=Chapter IV: &quot;The Schism of Photius&quot;, pp. 146–147}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Photios had an excellent education, we have no information about how he received this education. The famous library he possessed attests to his enormous erudition (theology, history, grammar, philosophy, law, the natural sciences, and medicine).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tat102&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Tatakes|Moutafakis|2003|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars believe that he never taught at [[University of Constantinople|Magnaura]] or at any other university;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mango|1980|pp=168–169}}; {{harvnb|Treadgold|1983|p=1100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasileios N. Tatakes asserts that, even while he was patriarch, Photios taught &quot;young students passionately eager for knowledge&quot; at his home, which &quot;was a center of learning&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tat102&quot; /&gt; He was a friend of the renowned Byzantine scholar and teacher [[Leo the Mathematician]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vlasto&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Entry of the Slavs into Christendom: An Introduction to the Medieval History of the Slavs |last=Vlasto |first=A. P. |authorlink= |year=1970 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn= |page=33 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photios says that, when he was young, he had an inclination for the monastic life, but instead he started a secular career. The way to public life was probably opened for him by (according to one account) the marriage of his brother Sergios to Irene, a sister of Empress [[Theodora (9th century)|Theodora]], who upon the death of her husband Emperor [[Theophilos, Byzantine Emperor|Theophilos]] (r. 829–842) in 842, had assumed the regency of the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=483}} Photios became a captain of the guard (''[[protospatharios|prōtospatharios]]'') and subsequently chief imperial secretary (''[[Protasekretis|protasēkrētis]]''). At an uncertain date, Photios participated in an embassy to the [[Abbasids]] of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plexidas|2007|loc=&quot;Introduction&quot;, p. 17}}; {{harvnb|Shepard|2002|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patriarch of Constantinople==
Photios's ecclesiastical career took off spectacularly after ''[[Caesar (title)#Byzantine Empire|Caesar]]'' [[Bardas]] and his nephew, the youthful Emperor Michael, put an end to the administration of the regent [[Theodora II|Theodora]] and the [[logothete of the drome]] [[Theoktistos]] in 856. In 858, Bardas found himself opposed by the then Patriarch [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople|Ignatios]], who refused to admit him into [[Hagia Sophia]], since it was believed that he was having an affair with his widowed daughter-in-law. In response, Bardas and Michael engineered Ignatios's confinement and removal on the charge of treason, thus leaving the patriarchal throne empty. The throne was soon filled with a kinsman of Bardas, Photios himself, who was tonsured a monk on December 20, 858, and on the four following days was successively ordained lector, sub-deacon, deacon and priest, and then on Christmas Day, the [[patronal feast]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janin |first= Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Janin|title=La Géographie Ecclésiastique de l'Empire Byzantin. 1. Part: Le Siège de Constantinople et le Patriarcat Oecuménique. 3rd Vol. : Les Églises et les Monastères |publisher=Institut Français d'Etudes Byzantines |location=Paris |year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Constantinople's cathedral, Hagia Sophia, Photius was [[Consecration in Eastern Christianity#Consecration of bishops|consecrated a bishop]] and installed as patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tougher|1997|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The confinement and removal of Ignatios and the speedy promotion of Photios at first caused only internal controversy within the Church of Constantinople, and in 859 a local council was held, examining the issue and confirming the removal of Ignatios and election of Photios.{{sfn|Dvornik|1948|pp=39-69}} In the same time, partisans of Ignatios decided to appeal to the Church of Rome, thus initiating ecclesiastical controversy on an ecumenical scale as the [[Pope]] and the rest of the western bishops took up the cause of Ignatios. The latter's confinement and removal without a formal ecclesiastical trial meant that Photios's election was uncanonical, and eventually [[Pope Nicholas I]] sought to involve himself in determining the legitimacy of the succession. His legates were dispatched to Constantinople with instructions to investigate, but finding Photios well ensconced, they acquiesced in the confirmation of his election at a [[Council of Constantinople (861)|synod]] in 861.{{sfn|Dvornik|1948|pp=70-90}} On their return to Rome, they discovered that this was not at all what Nicholas had intended, and in 863 at a synod in Rome the pope deposed Photios, and reappointed Ignatius as the rightful patriarch, triggering a [[Photian schism|schism]]. Four years later, Photios was to respond on his own part by calling a Council and [[excommunication|excommunicating]] the pope on grounds of heresy – over the question of the double procession of the [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fortescue|2001|pp=147–148}}; {{harvnb|Louth|2007|p=171}}; {{harvnb|Tougher|1997|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was additionally complicated by the question of [[Papacy|papal]] authority over the entire Church and by disputed jurisdiction over newly converted [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|2003|loc=Chapter 3: &quot;Early Christian Diversity: The Quest for Coherence&quot;, p. 146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This state of affairs changed with the murder of Photios's patron [[Bardas]] in 866 and of Emperor Michael III in 867, by his colleague [[Basil I the Macedonian|Basil the Macedonian]], who now usurped the throne. Photios was deposed as patriarch, not so much because he was a protégé of Bardas and Michael, but because Basil I was seeking an alliance with the Pope and the western emperor. Photios was removed from his office and banished about the end of September 867,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=483}} and Ignatios was reinstated on November 23. Photios was condemned by the [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|Council of 869–870]], thus putting an end to the schism. During his second patriarchate, however, Ignatios followed a policy not very different from that of Photios.

Not long after his condemnation, Photios had reingratiated himself with Basil, and became tutor to the Byzantine emperor's children. From surviving letters of Photios written during his exile at the Skepi monastery, it appears that the ex-patriarch brought pressure to bear on the Byzantine emperor to restore him. Ignatios's biographer argues that Photios forged a document relating to the genealogy and rule of Basil's family, and had it placed in the imperial library where a friend of his was a librarian. According to this document, the Byzantine emperor's ancestors were not mere peasants as everyone believed but descendants of the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|loc=Chapter Fourteen: &quot;External Gains, 842–912&quot;, p. 457}}.&lt;/ref&gt; True or not, this story does reveal Basil's dependence on Photios for literary and ideological matters. Following Photios's recall, Ignatios and the ex-patriarch met, and publicly expressed their reconciliation. When Ignatios died on October 23, 877, it was a matter of course that his old opponent replaced him on the patriarchal throne three days later. Shaun Tougher asserts that from this point on Basil no longer simply depended on Photios, but in fact he was dominated by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tougher|1997|pp=70–71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Патриарх фотий.png|thumb|270px|A fresco of St. Photius as Patriarch of Constantinople]]

Photios now obtained the formal recognition of the Christian world in a [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|council convened at Constantinople]] in November 879. The legates of [[Pope John VIII]] attended, prepared to acknowledge Photios as legitimate patriarch, a concession for which the pope was much censured by Latin opinion. The patriarch stood firm on the main points contested between the Eastern and Western Churches: the demand of an apology to the Pope, the ecclesiastical jurisdiction over [[Bulgaria]], and the addition of the ''[[filioque clause|filioque]]'' to the [[Nicene creed]] by the Western church.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=483}} Eventually, Photios refused to apologize or accept the ''filioque'', and the papal legates made do with his return of Bulgaria to Rome. This concession, however, was purely nominal, as Bulgaria's return to the [[Byzantine rite]] in 870 had already secured for it an autocephalous church. Without the consent of [[Boris I of Bulgaria]] (r. 852–889), the papacy was unable to enforce its claims.

During the altercations between Emperor Basil I and his heir [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]], Photios took the side of the Byzantine emperor. In 883, Basil accused Leo of conspiracy and confined the prince to the palace; he would have even have Leo blinded had he not been dissuaded by Photios and [[Stylianos Zaoutzes]], the father of [[Zoe Zaoutzaina]], Leo's mistress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=460}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 886, Basil discovered and punished a conspiracy by the domestic of the ''[[Hikanatoi]]'' [[John Kourkouas the Elder]] and many other officials. In this conspiracy, Leo was not implicated, but Photios was possibly one of the conspirators against Basil's authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vlyssidou|1997|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Basil died in 886 injured while hunting, according to the official story. Warren T. Treadgold believes that this time the evidence points to a plot on behalf of Leo VI, who became emperor, and deposed Photios, although the latter had been his tutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=461}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Photios was replaced by the Byzantine emperor's brother [[Ecumenical Patriarch Stephen I of Constantinople|Stephen]], and sent into exile to the monastery of Bordi in [[Armenia]]. It is confirmed from letters to and from [[Pope Stephen V|Pope Stephen]] that Leo extracted a resignation from Photios. In 887, Photios and his protégé, [[Theodore Santabarenos]], were put on trial for treason before a tribunal headed by senior officials, headed by [[Andrew the Scythian]]. Although the sources sympathetic to Photios give the impression that the trial ended without a conviction, the chronicle of Pseudo-Symeon clearly states that Photios was banished to the monastery of Gordon, where he later died. Latin sources confirm that he died in a state of complete excommunication by Pope John VIII. &lt;ref&gt;https://sensusfidelium.us/apologetics/history-of-heresies-their-refutation-st-alphonsus/the-errors-of-the-greeks-condemned-in-three-general-councils/&lt;/ref&gt;   Yet it appears that he did not remain reviled for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tougher|1997|pp=73–76, 84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Photios continued his career as a writer throughout his exile, and Leo probably rehabilitated his reputation within the next few years; in his ''Epitaphios'' on his brothers, a text probably written in 888, the Emperor presents Photios favorably, portraying him as the legitimate archbishop, and the instrument of ultimate unity, an image that jars with his attitude to the patriarch in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tougher|1997|pp=85–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmation that Photios was rehabilitated comes upon his death: according to some chronicles, his body was permitted to be buried in Constantinople. In addition, according to the anti-Photian biographer of Ignatius, partisans of the ex-patriarch after his death endeavored to claim for him the &quot;honor of sainthood&quot;. Furthermore, a leading member of Leo's court, [[Leo Choirosphaktes]], wrote poems commemorating the memory of several prominent contemporary figures, such as [[Leo the Mathematician]] and the Patriarch Stephen, and he also wrote one on Photios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tougher|1997|pp=87–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaun Tougher notes, however, that &quot;yet Photios's passing does seem rather muted for a great figure of Byzantine history [...] Leo [...] certainly did not allow him back into the sphere of politics, and it is surely his absence from this arena that accounts for his quiet passing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tougher|1997|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Photios as a saint, his feast day being February 6; Ignatius is also venerated as a saint both in Eastern Orthodox Church, his feast day being October 23, and in the Roman Catholic Church.

==Assessments==
Photios is one of the most famous figures not only of 9th-century Byzantium but of the entire history of the Byzantine Empire. One of the most learned men of his age, and revered – even by some of his opponents and detractors – as the most prolific theologian of his time, he has earned his fame due to his part in ecclesiastical conflicts, and also for his intellect and literary works.{{Sfn |Louth|2007|loc=Chapter Seven: &quot;Renaissance of Learning: East and West&quot;, p. 171}}{{Sfn |Tougher|1997|p= 68}}

Analyzing his intellectual work, Tatakes regards Photios as &quot;mind turned more to practice than to theory&quot;. He believes that, thanks to Photios, humanism was added to Orthodoxy as a basic element of the national consciousness of the medieval Byzantines, returning it to the place it had had in the late Roman (early Byzantine) period.  Tatakes also argues that, having understood this national consciousness, Photios emerged as a defender of the Greek nation and its spiritual independence in his debates with the Western Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tat103&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Tatakes|Moutafakis|2003|p= 103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrian Fortescue]] regards him as &quot;one of the most wonderful men of all the middle ages&quot;, and stresses that &quot;had [he] not given his name to the great schism, he would always be remembered as the greatest scholar of his time&quot;.{{Sfn |Fortescue|2001|p= 138}} Yet, Fortescue is equally adamant of his condemnation of Photios' involvement in the Schism: &quot;And yet the other side of his character is no less evident. His insatiable ambition, his determination to obtain and keep the patriarchal see, led him to the extreme of dishonesty. His claim was worthless. That Ignatius was the rightful patriarch as long as he lived, and Photius an intruder, cannot be denied by any one who does not conceive the Church as merely the slave of a civil government. And to keep this place Photius descended to the lowest depth of deceit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12043b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
The most important of the works of Photios is his renowned ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' or ''Myriobiblon'', a collection of extracts and abridgements of 280 volumes of classical authors (usually cited as Codices), the originals of which are now to a great extent lost. The work is especially rich in extracts from historical writers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=483}}

Some older scholarship speculated that the ''Bibliotheca'' was in fact compiled in [[Baghdad]] at the time of Photius's embassy to the [[Abbasid]] court, since many of the mentioned works were rarely cited during the so-called Byzantine Dark Ages c. 630 – c. 800, and it was known that the Abbasids were interested in works of Greek science and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jokisch|2007|pp=365–386}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, specialists of this period of Byzantine history, such as [[Paul Lemerle]], have shown that Photios could not have compiled his ''Bibliotheca'' in Baghdad because he clearly states in both his introduction and his postscript that when he learned of his appointment to the embassy, he sent his brother a summary of books that he read ''previously'', &quot;since the time I learned how to understand and evaluate literature&quot; i.e. since his youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jokisch|2007|pp=365–386}}; {{harvnb|Lemerle|1986|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Abbasids were interested only in Greek science, philosophy and medicine; they did not have Greek history, rhetoric, or other literary works translated; nor did they have Christian patristic writers translated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lemerle|1986|pp=26–27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the majority of works in ''Bibliotheca'' are by Christian patristic authors, and most of the secular texts in ''Bibliotheca'' are histories, grammars or literary works, usually rhetoric, rather than science, medicine or philosophy. This further indicates that the majority of the works cannot have been read while Photios was in the Abbasid empire.

To Photios, we are indebted for almost all we possess of [[Ctesias]], [[Memnon of Heraclea]], [[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]], the lost books of [[Diodorus Siculus]], and the lost writings of [[Arrian]]. Theology and ecclesiastical history are also very fully represented, but poetry and ancient philosophy are almost entirely ignored. It seems that he did not think it necessary to deal with those authors with whom every well-educated man would naturally be familiar. The literary criticisms, generally distinguished by keen and independent judgment, and the excerpts vary considerably in length. The numerous biographical notes are probably taken from the work of [[Hesychius of Miletus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=483}}

The ''Lexicon'' (Λέξεων Συναγωγή), published later than the ''Bibliotheca'', was probably in the main the work of some of his pupils. It was intended as a book of reference to facilitate the reading of old classical and sacred authors, whose language and vocabulary were out of date. For a long time, the only manuscripts of the ''Lexicon'' were the ''Codex Galeanus'', which passed into the library of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=483}} and Berolinensis graec. oct. 22, both of which were incomplete. But in 1959, Linos Politis of the University of Thessaloniki discovered a complete manuscript, codex Zavordensis 95, in the Zavorda Monastery (Greek: Ζάβορδα) in [[Grevena]], Greece, where it still resides.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2011/01/15/the-lexicon-of-photius/ The Lexicon of Photius]&quot; by Roger Pearse, January 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

His most important theological work is the ''Amphilochia'', a collection of some 300 questions and answers on difficult points in Scripture, addressed to Amphilochius, archbishop of Cyzicus. Other similar works are his treatise in four books against the [[Manichaean]]s and [[Paulicians]], and his controversy with the Latins on the Procession of the [[Holy Spirit]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=483–484}} Photios also addressed a long letter of theological advice to the newly converted Boris I of Bulgaria. Numerous other ''Epistles'' also survive.

Photios is also the writer of two &quot;mirrors of princes&quot;, addressed to Boris-Michael of Bulgaria (Epistula 1, ed. Terzaghi) and to Leo VI the Wise (Admonitory Chapters of Basil I).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paidas|2005|loc=passim}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief contemporary authority for the life of Photios is his bitter enemy, Nicetas the Paphlagonian, the biographer of his rival Ignatios.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=484}}

The first English translation, by Holy Transfiguration Monastery, of the &quot;[[Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit]]&quot; by Photios was published in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Photius|title=On the Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit|publisher=Studion Publishers|year=1983|isbn=0-943670-00-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5tPYAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another translation was published in 1987 with a preface by [[Archimandrite]] (now [[Archbishop]]) Chrysostomos of [[Mount Etna|Etna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Photius|author2=Joseph P.

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
{{Cnote|a|The exact dates of Photios's birth and death are not known. Most sources list circa 810 and others circa 820 as his year of birth. He died some time between 890 and 895 (probably 891 or 893).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mango|1980|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Plexidas|2007|loc=&quot;Introduction&quot;, p. 15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Cnote|b|The case of pseudo-Simeon's ''Chronicle'' is characteristic: the author argues that Photios was educated after an agreement he concluded with a Jewish magician who offered him knowledge and secular recognition, in case he renounced his faith.&lt;ref&gt;Symeon Metaphrastes (?). ''Chronicle'', [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/30_20_0950-1050-_Symeon_Metaphrastes.html PG 109, 732 BC]; {{harvnb|Plexidas|2007|loc=&quot;Introduction&quot;, p. 15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Cnote|c|David Marshall Lang argues that &quot;Photius [...] was only one of many Byzantine scholars of Armenian descent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|1988|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Charanis]] notes that &quot;[[Patriarch John VII of Constantinople|John the Grammarian]], Photius, Caesar Bardas and [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo the Philosopher]] seem to have been the prime movers. All four were, at least in part, of Armenian descent [...] as for Photius, the fact is that his mother Irene, was the sister of [[Arshavir]], the Arshavir who had married Calomaria the sister of Bardas and the empress Theodora.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Charanis|1963|pp=27–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Adontz]] stresses that &quot;Arshavir, Photius' uncle, must not be confused with Arshavir, the brother of John the Grammarian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adontz|1950|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Cnote|d|G. N. Wilson regards [[Leo the Mathematician]] as Photios's teacher, but [[Paul Lemerle]] notes that Leo was not one of the persons with whom Photios had a correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lemerle|1971|p=159}}; {{harvnb|Plexidas|2007|loc=&quot;Introduction&quot;, p. 16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

:”Punishment of the former kaiser and other German war criminals is worrying Great Britain little, it was said. As a matter of form, however, the British and French governments were expected to request Holland for the former kaiser’s extradition. Holland, it was said, will refuse on the ground of constitutional provisions covering the case and then the matter will be dropped. The request for extradition will not be based on genuine desire on the part of British officials to bring the kaiser to trial, according to authoritative information, but is considered necessary formality to ‘save the face’ of politicians who promised to see that Wilhelm was punished for his crimes.”&lt;ref&gt;United Press, “Former Kaiser Will Never Be Tried For War - Holland Will Refuse Extradition - Demand Will Be Made as Matter of Form But Britain and France Will Drop Case When Dutch Refuse to Deliver War Lord,” ''Riverside Daily Press'', Riverside, California, Thursday evening, 1 January 1920, Volume XXXV, Number 1, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the United States opposed extradition, arguing that prosecuting Wilhelm would destabilise international order and lose the peace.{{Sfn | Ashton | Hellema | 2000 | pp = 53–78}}

Wilhelm first settled in [[Amerongen Castle|Amerongen]], where on 28 November he issued a belated statement of abdication from both the Prussian and imperial thrones, thus formally ending the Hohenzollerns' 500-year rule over Prussia.  Accepting the reality that he had lost both of his crowns for good, he gave up his rights to &quot;the throne of Prussia and to the German Imperial throne connected therewith.&quot;  He also released his soldiers and officials in both Prussia and the empire from their oath of loyalty to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Year Book: A Record of Events and Progress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jzM9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA153|year=1919|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; He purchased a country house in the municipality of [[Doorn]], known as [[Huis Doorn]], and moved in on 15 May 1920.{{Sfn | Macdonogh | 2001 | p = 426}} This was to be his home for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/the-last-kaiser-the-dramatic-story-of-wilhelm-ii-the-last-emperor-of-the-german-reich/ The Last Kaiser, Radio Netherlands Archives, November 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Weimar Republic]] allowed Wilhelm to remove twenty-three railway wagons of furniture, twenty-seven containing packages of all sorts, one bearing a car and another a boat, from the [[New Palace (Potsdam)|New Palace]] at Potsdam.{{Sfn | Macdonogh | 2001 | p = 425}}

===Life in exile===
In 1922, Wilhelm published the first volume of his memoirs{{Sfn | Hohenzollern | 1922}}—a very slim volume that insisted he was not guilty of initiating the Great War, and defended his conduct throughout his reign, especially in matters of foreign policy. For the remaining twenty years of his life, he entertained guests (often of some standing) and kept himself updated on events in Europe. He grew a beard and allowed his famous moustache to droop, adopting a style very similar to that of his cousins [[King George V]] and [[Tsar Nicholas II]], (and still worn by [[Prince Michael of Kent]] today). He also learned the Dutch language. Wilhelm developed a penchant for archaeology while residing at the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Corfu Achilleion]], excavating at the site of the [[Temple of Artemis, Corfu|Temple of Artemis in Corfu]], a passion he retained in his exile. He had bought the former Greek residence of [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Empress Elisabeth]] after her murder in 1898. He also sketched plans for grand buildings and battleships when he was bored. In exile, one of Wilhelm's greatest passions was hunting, and he bagged thousands of animals, both beast and bird. Much of his time was spent chopping wood and thousands of trees were chopped down during his stay at Doorn.{{Sfn | Macdonogh | 2001 | p = 457}}

====Views on Nazism====

In the early 1930s, Wilhelm apparently hoped that the successes of the German [[Nazi Party]] would stimulate interest in a restoration of the monarchy, with his eldest grandson as the fourth Kaiser. His second wife, Hermine, actively petitioned the Nazi government on her husband's behalf. However, [[Adolf Hitler]], himself a veteran of the [[First World War]], like other leading Nazis, felt nothing but contempt for the man they blamed for Germany's greatest defeat, and the petitions were ignored. Though he played host to [[Hermann Göring]] at Doorn on at least one occasion, Wilhelm grew to distrust Hitler. Hearing of the murder of the wife of former [[Kurt von Schleicher|Chancellor Schleicher]], he said &quot;We have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the Nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall!&quot;{{Sfn | Macdonogh | 2001 | pp = 452–52}}

Wilhelm was also appalled at the [[Kristallnacht]] of 9–10 November 1938, saying &quot;I have just made my views clear to [[Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia|Auwi]] [August Wilhelm, Wilhelm's fourth son] in the presence of his brothers. He had the nerve to say that he agreed with the Jewish [[pogrom]]s and understood why they had come about. When I told him that any decent man would describe these actions as gangsterisms, he appeared totally indifferent. He is completely lost to our family&quot;.{{Sfn | Macdonogh | 2001 | p = 456}} Wilhelm also stated, &quot;For the first time, I am ashamed to be a German.&quot;{{Sfn | Balfour | 1964 | p = 419}}
{{quote|&quot;There's a man alone, without family, without children, without God&amp;nbsp;... He builds legions, but he doesn't build a nation. A nation is created by families, a religion, traditions: it is made up out of the hearts of mothers, the wisdom of fathers, the joy and the exuberance of children&amp;nbsp;... For a few months I was inclined to believe in National Socialism. I thought of it as a necessary fever. And I was gratified to see that there were, associated with it for a time, some of the wisest and most outstanding Germans. But these, one by one, he has got rid of or even killed&amp;nbsp;... He has left nothing but a bunch of shirted gangsters! This man could bring home victories to our people each year, without bringing them either glory or danger. But of our Germany, which was a nation of poets and musicians, of artists and soldiers, he has made a nation of hysterics and hermits, engulfed in a mob and led by a thousand liars or fanatics.&quot; ― Wilhelm on Hitler, December 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/pdf/Kaiser_Wm_and_Hitler.pdf|title=The Kaiser on Hitler|publisher=[[Ken (magazine)|Ken]]|date=15 December 1938|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In the wake of the [[Invasion of Poland|German victory over Poland]] in September 1939, Wilhelm's adjutant, {{interlanguage link|Wilhelm von Dommes|lt=General von Dommes|de}}, wrote on his behalf to Hitler, stating that the House of Hohenzollern &quot;remained loyal&quot; and noted that nine Prussian Princes (one son and eight grandchildren) were stationed at the front, concluding &quot;because of the special circumstances that require residence in a neutral foreign country, His Majesty must personally decline to make the aforementioned comment. The Emperor has therefore charged me with making a communication.&quot;{{Sfn | Petropoulos | 2006 | p = 170}} Wilhelm greatly admired the success which Hitler was able to achieve in the opening months of the Second World War, and personally sent a congratulatory telegram when the Netherlands surrendered in May 1940: &quot;My Fuhrer, I congratulate you and hope that under your marvellous leadership the German monarchy will be restored completely.&quot; Hitler was reportedly exasperated and bemused, and remarked to [[Heinz Linge|Linge]], his valet, &quot;What an idiot!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Second World War (Antony Beevor book)|The Second World War]]'', [[Antony Beevor]], Phoenix Books, 2013; pp.92–3&lt;/ref&gt; In another telegram to Hitler upon the fall of Paris a month later, Wilhelm stated &quot;Congratulations, you have won using ''my'' troops.&quot; In a letter to his daughter [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|Victoria Louise]], Duchess of Brunswick, he wrote triumphantly, &quot;Thus is the pernicious ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'' of Uncle [[Edward VII]] brought to nought.&quot;{{Sfn | Palmer | 1978 | p = 226}} Nevertheless, after the German conquest of the Netherlands in 1940, the ageing Wilhelm retired completely from public life. In May 1940, when Hitler invaded the Netherlands, Wilhelm declined an offer from Churchill of asylum in Britain, preferring to remain at ''Huis Doorn''.{{Sfn | Gilbert | 1994 | p = 523}}

====Anti-England, anti-Semitic, and anti-Freemason views====
During his last year at Doorn, Wilhelm believed that Germany was the land of monarchy and therefore of Christ, and that England was the land of liberalism and therefore of [[Satan]] and the [[Anti-Christ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conflict, Catastrophe and Continuity: Essays on Modern German History|last=Röhl|first=John C. G.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780521844314|pages=1263|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the English ruling classes were &quot;[[Freemasons]] thoroughly infected by Juda&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Wilhelm asserted that the &quot;British people must be ''liberated'' from ''Antichrist Juda''. We must drive Juda out of England just as he has been chased out of the Continent.&quot;{{Sfn | Röhl | p = 211}}{{Clarify|which text?| date = June 2011}}

He believed the Freemasons and Jews had caused the two world wars, aiming at a world Jewish empire with British and American gold, but that &quot;Juda's plan has been smashed to pieces and they themselves swept out of the European Continent!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Continental Europe was now, Wilhelm wrote, &quot;consolidating and closing itself off from British influences after the elimination of the British and the Jews!&quot; The end result would be a &quot;[[U.S. of Europe]]!&quot;{{Sfn | Röhl | p = 211}}{{Clarify|which text?| date = June 2011}} In a 1940 letter to his sister [[Princess Margaret of Prussia|Princess Margaret]], Wilhelm wrote: &quot;The hand of God is creating a new world &amp; working miracles... We are becoming the U.S. of Europe under German leadership, a united European Continent.&quot; He added: &quot;The Jews [are] being thrust out of their nefarious positions in all countries, whom they have driven to hostility for centuries.&quot;{{Sfn | Petropoulos | 2006 | p = 170}}

Also in 1940 came what would have been his mother's 100th birthday, on which he wrote ironically to a friend &quot;Today the 100th birthday of my mother! No notice is taken of it at home! No 'Memorial Service' or&amp;nbsp;... committee to remember her marvellous work for the&amp;nbsp;... welfare of our German people&amp;nbsp;... Nobody of the new generation knows anything about her.&quot;{{Sfn | Pakula | 1997 | p = 602}}

===Death===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L19106, Doorn, Beisetzung Kaiser Wilhelm II..jpg|thumb|The funeral of Wilhelm II]]
[[File:Mausoleumwhilhelm.JPG|thumb|Wilhelm's tomb at Huis Doorn]]
Wilhelm died of a [[pulmonary embolism|pulmonary embolus]] in Doorn, Netherlands, on 4 June 1941, at the age of 82, just weeks before the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]].  German soldiers had been guarding his house.  Hitler, however, was reported{{By whom|date=November 2015}} to be angry that the former monarch had an honour guard of German troops and nearly fired the general who ordered them when he found out. Despite his personal animosity toward Wilhelm, Hitler wanted to bring his body back to Berlin for a state funeral, as Wilhelm was a symbol of Germany and Germans during the previous World War. Hitler felt that such a funeral would demonstrate to the Germans the direct descent of the [[Third Reich]] from the old [[German Empire]].{{Sfn | Sweetman | 1973 | pp = 654–55}}  However, Wilhelm's wishes never to return to Germany until the restoration of the monarchy were respected, and the Nazi occupation authorities granted him a small military funeral, with a few hundred people present. The mourners included [[August von Mackensen]], fully dressed in his old imperial Life Hussars uniform, Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]], General [[Curt Haase]] and ''Reichskommissar'' for the Netherlands [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], along with a few other military advisers. However, Wilhelm's request that the [[swastika]] and other Nazi regalia not be displayed at his funeral was ignored, and they are featured in the photographs of the event taken by a Dutch photographer.{{Sfn | Macdonogh | 2001 | p = 459}}

Wilhelm was buried in a mausoleum in the grounds of Huis Doorn, which has since become a place of pilgrimage for German monarchists. A few of these gather there every year on the anniversary of his death to pay their homage to the last German Emperor.{{Sfn | Ruggenberg | 1998}}

==Historiography==
Three trends have characterised the writing about Wilhelm. First, the court-inspired writers considered him a martyr and a hero, often uncritically accepting the justifications provided in the Kaiser's own memoirs. Second, there came those who judged Wilhelm to be completely unable to handle the great responsibilities of his position, a ruler too reckless to deal with power. Third, after 1950, later scholars have sought to transcend the passions of the early 20th century and attempted an objective portrayal of Wilhelm and his rule.{{Sfn | Goetz | 1955 | pp = 21–44}}

On 8 June 1913, a year before the Great War began, ''The New York Times'' published a special supplement devoted to the 25th anniversary of the Kaiser's accession. The banner headline read: ''&quot;Kaiser, 25 Years a Ruler, Hailed as Chief Peacemaker&quot;''. The accompanying story called him &quot;the greatest factor for peace that our time can show&quot;, and credited Wilhelm with frequently rescuing Europe from the brink of war.{{Sfn | New York Times | 1913}} Until the late 1950s, the Kaiser was depicted by most historians as a man of considerable influence. Partly that was a deception by German officials. For example, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] believed the Kaiser was in control of German foreign policy because [[Hermann Speck von Sternburg]], the German ambassador in Washington and a personal friend of Roosevelt, presented to the president messages from [[Chancellor von Bülow]] as messages from the Kaiser. Later historians downplayed his role, arguing that senior officials learned to work around him. More recently historian [[John C. G. Röhl]] has portrayed Wilhelm as the key figure in understanding the recklessness and downfall of Imperial Germany.{{Sfn | Röhl | 1994 | p = 10}}  Thus, the argument is made that the Kaiser played a major role in promoting the policies of naval and colonial expansion that caused the sharp deterioration in Germany's relations with Britain before 1914.{{Sfn | McLean | 2001 | pp = 478–502}}{{Sfn | Berghahn | 2003 | pp = 281–93}}

Empress Augusta, known affectionately as &quot;Dona&quot;, was a constant companion to Wilhelm, and her death on 11 April 1921 was a devastating blow. It also came less than a year after their son Joachim committed suicide.

===Remarriage===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11383, Doorn, Kaiser Wilhelm II. mit Gattin und Tochter.jpg|thumb|With second wife, Hermine, and her daughter, [[Princess Henriette of Schönaich-Carolath|Princess Henriette]]]]
The following January, Wilhelm received a birthday greeting from a son of the late Prince Johann George Ludwig Ferdinand August Wilhelm of Schönaich-Carolath. The 63-year-old Wilhelm invited the boy and his mother, [[Hermine Reuss of Greiz|Princess Hermine Reuss of Greiz]], to [[Doorn]]. Wilhelm found Hermine very attractive, and greatly enjoyed her company. The couple were wed in Doorn on 9 November 1922&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ex Kaiser's Secret Wedding 1922 |url=https://www.britishpathe.com/video/ex-kaisers-secret-wedding/query/wedding |website=British Pathe News}}&lt;/ref&gt;, despite the objections of Wilhelm's monarchist supporters and his children. Hermine's daughter, [[Princess Henriette of Schönaich-Carolath|Princess Henriette]], married the late Prince Joachim's son, Karl Franz Josef, in 1940, but divorced in 1946. Hermine remained a constant companion to the ageing former emperor until his death.

==Religion==
===Own views===
Emperor Wilhelm II was a [[Lutheran]] member of the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces]]. It was a [[United Protestant]] denomination, bringing together [[Reformed]] and [[Lutheran]] believers.

===Attitude towards Islam===
Wilhelm II was on friendly terms with the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Dudoignon|editor1-first=Stephane A.|editor2-last=Hisao|editor2-first=Komatsu|editor3-last=Yasushi|editor3-first=Kosugi|title=Intellectuals in the Modern Islamic World: Transmission, Transformation and Communication|url=https://archive.org/details/intellectualsmod00dudo|url-access=limited|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134205974|page=[https://archive.org/details/intellectualsmod00dudo/page/n206 188]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described himself as a &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;300 million [[Mohammedan|Mohammedans]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Motadel|editor1-first=David|title=Islam and the European Empires|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199668311|pages=244–5|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his trip to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] (which he visited three times – an unbeaten record for any European monarch)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacob M.

===Antisemitism===
Wilhelm's biographer [[Lamar Cecil]] identified Wilhelm's &quot;curious but well-developed anti-Semitism&quot;, noting that in 1888 a friend of Wilhelm &quot;declared that the young Kaiser's dislike of his Hebrew subjects, one rooted in a perception that they possessed an overweening influence in Germany, was so strong that it could not be overcome&quot;.
Cecil concludes:
:Wilhelm never changed, and throughout his life he believed that Jews were perversely responsible, largely through their prominence in the Berlin press and in leftist political movements, for encouraging opposition to his rule. For individual Jews, ranging from rich businessmen and major art collectors to purveyors of elegant goods in Berlin stores, he had considerable esteem, but he prevented Jewish citizens from having careers in the army and the diplomatic corps and frequently used abusive language against them.{{sfn|Cecil|2000|p=57}}

On 2 December 1919, Wilhelm wrote to Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], denouncing his own abdication as the &quot;deepest, most disgusting shame ever perpetrated by a person in history, the Germans have done to themselves&amp;nbsp;... egged on and misled by the tribe of [[Jew|Judah]]&amp;nbsp;... Let no German ever forget this, nor rest until these parasites have been destroyed and exterminated from German soil!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Röhl, ''The Kaiser and His Court: Wilhelm II and the Government of Germany'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 1994), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm advocated a &quot;regular international all-worlds pogrom à la Russe&quot; as &quot;the best cure&quot; and further believed that Jews were a &quot;nuisance that humanity must get rid of some way or other. I believe the best thing would be gas!&quot;{{sfn|Röhl|1994|p=210}}

==Early life and education==

Born in [[Aberdeen]], [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland, he grew up in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Lancashire]], England. Garden was educated at [[Repton School]], and studied medicine at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he joined the [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club]] and served as its president in 1964, while also performing in the 1964 Footlights revue, ''Stuff What Dreams Are Made Of'' at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].&lt;ref name=footlights/&gt;

Garden qualified in medicine at [[King's College London]], but has never practised.&lt;ref name=&quot;WINKLER-2005&quot; /&gt; Asked how he justified making jokes rather than saving lives, he answered:

{{Quote|I don't think I would have done it as well. It's an interesting question – whether you've contributed more to the vast store of human enjoyment by doing comedy or by being a doctor, but the answer for me is that I don't think I would have been as successful or as happy being a doctor.&lt;ref name=&quot;WINKLER-2005&quot;&gt;

==Career==

===Radio===

Garden was co-writer and performer in the classic BBC [[radio comedy]] sketch show, ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', in the late 1960s. Garden was studying medicine during the early series of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'', and this commitment made it difficult for him to be a member of the cast during the third series because of a midwifery medical course in [[Plymouth]]. However, he continued sending scripts for the radio show by mail – and rejoined the cast upon his return to his medical studies in London.&lt;ref&gt;''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' – 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960–1980' – Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions his medical qualifications are lampooned; in the 25th Anniversary Show, David Hatch asks him if he is still a writer.

===Marching===
[[File:Purdue Drum.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The Purdue University's marching band has a large bass drum]]
In a [[marching band]]'s field show, bass drummers tend to turn to face either goal line. When standing on the 20 yard line, it can become difficult to see the drum major while facing the goal line. Or if the basses can't dress a form facing one direction, they can turn the other way for that section. Turns can take place either in unison, or rippled for a different effect.

For the lower basses it takes a lot more control to turn quickly. Cleaning turns for a bassline can be rather easy. They should lead with the shoulder at the start of the turn and lock the other direction on a specified count. Setting a check-point can help. For instance, one should be flat front on count two of the turn. However, note that the turn should be smooth and not jerky. A common problem may result from not stopping the weight of the drum at the end of the turn and letting the [[momentum]] get the better of the player. The solution to that problem involves tightening the core (abdominals and back muscles).

As well as marking time as above, in some marching bands, the bass drum is used to give orders to the band e.g.
*One stroke is used to order the band (and associated troops) to start/stop marching
*Two strokes are used to order the band to stop marching
*Two strong strokes (Double Beat) are used when the music is due to cut off (usually a double beat then three beats and finish)

[[File:Fill with groove number 2 and crash.png|325px|right|thumb|In rock and popular drumming styles the crash cymbal frequently follows a [[fill (music)|fill]], replacing the first note of the next measure and accompanying the [[bass drum]].&lt;ref&gt;Peckman, Jonathan (2007). ''Picture Yourself Drumming'', p.65. {{ISBN|1-59863-330-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Audio|Fill with groove number 2 and crash.mid|play}}]]

A '''crash cymbal''' is a type of [[cymbal]] that produces a loud, sharp &quot;crash&quot; and is used mainly for occasional accents, as opposed to a [[ride cymbal]].  It can be mounted on a stand and played with a [[drum stick]], or by hand in [[clash cymbals|pairs]]. One or two crash cymbals are a standard part of a [[drum kit]]. [[Suspended cymbal|Suspended]] crash cymbals are also used in [[Band (music)|band]]s and [[orchestra]]s, either played with a drumstick or rolled with a pair of [[Drum stick#Mallets|mallets]] to produce a slower, swelling crash. Sometimes a drummer may hit two different crash cymbals in a kit at the same time to produce a very loud accent, usually in [[rock music]].
[[File:Crash cymbal.ogg|thumb|326x326px|The sound of a crash cymbal.]]
Although crash cymbals range in thickness from paper-thin to very heavy, all crash cymbals have a fairly thin edge. They are typically {{convert|14|to|18|in|cm}} in diameter, but sizes down to {{convert|8|in|cm}} and up to {{convert|24|in|cm}} are manufactured. Custom crash cymbals up to {{convert|28|in|cm}} in diameter have been used by [[big band]]s. Different thicknesses are used for different kinds of music, and the alloy for each manufacturer's models varies. A thick cymbal is likely to be used by a metal or rock band, while thinner cymbals are generally used in lighter rock. Darker crashes are best used for jazz.

The sound of a crash is changed by its luster. A cleaner cymbal creates a crisper sound, whereas a cymbal showing signs of oxidation (called a 'raw' cymbal) creates a duller sound.

Normally, two crashes are best for a drum set; a 16&quot; and a larger one.

==Position==

Crash cymbals were traditionally placed on the left side of the [[drum set]] (for a right-handed drummer) since the normally larger [[ride cymbal]] is usually on the right, however some drummers set up their crash on the right. Often a drummer will have multiple crashes, and so may set them up with one or two on each side or, less commonly, one mounted very closely above another, usually larger crash or ride.

[[File:Sabian AAX Xplosion Crash.JPG|thumb|An 18&quot; [[Sabian]] AAX X-plosion Crash.]]

Crash cymbals are often the first ones in a drum set to warp and ultimately crack, due to repeated striking of the edge. Cracking is generally in the form of a fracture along the edge, or across the bow, often originating from the edge. Cracks are caused by poor technique or excessive playing or more rarely as a result of a defect originating from manufacture or damage to the cymbal not caused by playing, for example dropping. If a crack is left untreated, it will begin to follow the lathe grooves around the cymbal and could potentially spread all the way around and back to the point where it started, causing the outer portion of a cymbal to simply drop off. Often, lower quality sheet cymbals are more likely to crack, due to stress caused in some areas by pressing sheet metal. Thicker cymbals are also more likely to crack due to their brittleness and less freedom to vibrate. Cymbal manufacturers suggest that wear on the cymbal can be reduced by playing with glancing blows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zildjian.com/Education/Zildjian-101/Care-and-Feeding |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629232408/http://zildjian.com/Education/Zildjian-101/Care-and-Feeding |archivedate=2012-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; angled to the side and slightly away from the vertical, about a quarter of the way between the edge and the center and allowing the drum stick to bounce off naturally, rather than forcing the stick down at the cymbal head-on. This allows the cymbal to vibrate freely and for little stress to be caused on the edge or at the center hole, thus reducing the chance of a crack. Cracked cymbals are often fixed either temporarily or permanently by drilling a hole at either end of the crack (often the crack will spread further than it appears to the naked eye, so this method is often not as effective) or removing the cracked portion or cutting the cymbal's edge down, although this method can drastically alter a cymbal's sound. Both of these methods are often ineffective at stopping cracks, but usually slow the spread of a crack down.

==Orchestral crash cymbals==
{{main|Clash cymbals}}
A pair of identical crash cymbals held in both hands by leather thongs passing through holes in each cymbals bell is called [[clash cymbals]] and is a standard part of an [[Percussion section|orchestral percussion]] section. Two tones are normally used by major orchestras, known as ''Germanic'' or ''Wagnerian'' (heavier) and ''Viennese'' (lighter); a third, rarer tone is known as ''French'' (lighter still). Crash cymbals are also used in stage, concert, marching, and military [[musical band|band]]s.

'''''Inter mirifica''''' (''Among the wonderful'') is a decree &quot;On the Media of Social Communication&quot; made by the council at [[Vatican II]] which was promulgated on December 4, 1963&lt;ref&gt;Franz-Josef Eilers, “Church and Social Communication: 40 years of Inter Mirifica and beyond,” Ad Veritatem 5 (2005), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Pope Paul VI]]. It is composed of 24 points, with the aim of addressing the concerns and problems of [[social communication]]. ''Inter mirifica'' identifies social communication as the press, cinema, television, and other similar types of communication interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19631204_inter-mirifica_en.html ''Inter mirifica'', #1, accessed September 25, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The title is taken from the opening lines of the document and means &quot;among the wonderful&quot;.

The term ''social communications'', apart from its more general use, has become the preferred term within documents of the [[Catholic Church]] for reference to [[mass media|media]] or [[mass media]].  It has the advantage, as a term, of wider connotation - all communication is social but not all communication is &quot;mass&quot;.  In effect, though, the two terms are used synonymously.

==Historical Background==
While ''Inter mirifica'' was one of the first decrees to reach a conclusion during Vatican II, the document itself went through many drafts, throughout its development. Over 70 drafts of ''Inter mirifica'' were prepared, yet out of all of these drafts, only nine were ready for final approval from the Vatican Council. The first draft ''Schema of a constitution on the Means of Social Communications'', combined with the other six, were made into one volume by July 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Norman P. Tanner, The Church and the World : ''Gaudium et spes'', ''Inter mirifica'' (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), 93.&lt;/ref&gt;  This draft document consisted of an Introduction (nos 1-5), doctrines of the Church (6-33), the Apostolate of the Church in the field (34-48), the discipline and the ecclesiastical order  (49-63), the different means of social communication (64-105), other means of Social Communication (106-111) and a conclusion (112-114).&lt;ref&gt;Franz-Josef Eilers, “Church and Social Communication: 40 years of Inter Mirifica and beyond,” Ad Veritatem 5 (2005), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the discussion on ''Inter mirifica'' lasted for a short period (November 23–27, 1962), the document had a drastic change. The final draft, reduced to a quarter of its original length, which contains an introductory section, two short chapters and a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Norman P. Tanner, The Church and the World : ''Gaudium et spes'', ''Inter mirifica'' (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes of ''Inter mirifica''==
* need for pastoral directive
* responsibility of the Church to monitor the use of social communications and media and ensure the spiritual well being of the Church community at large
* responsibility of the individual to ensure their own well being and to ensure they are not causing themselves &quot;spiritual harm&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #9&lt;/ref&gt;
* responsibility of the media, including those involved in producing media

==Summary==

===Introduction (#1–2)===
# The Council states that, with God’s help, man has created many means of social communications.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #1&lt;/ref&gt; These means of social communication can be used to reach all types of people around the world, and can be used to educate and inform. The [[Catholic Church]] recognizes that if these tools of social communication be used properly, they can greatly benefit mankind. Reversely, if used improperly, they are incredibly detrimental.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #2&lt;/ref&gt; The authors state that ''Inter mirifica'' will look at the problematic issues of social media, and ways that the Church can fix these problems.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter One: On the Teaching of the Church (#3–12)===
# The authors of ''Inter mirifica'' state that it is within the Church’s birthright to use the means of social communication to the pursuit of preaching the gospel and of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #3&lt;/ref&gt;
# There are three questions of morality within social communications that the authors of the decree look at:
## The media has an obligation to provide correct, honest, and accurate news, as the Council believes that access to information, in relation to their circumstances, is a human right.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #5&lt;/ref&gt;
## There is a question of morality in the news. The Council insists that news may only be effectively delivered if the information provided is of a true moral order.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #6&lt;/ref&gt;
## While the Council states that at times information can be harmful as long as it is more profitable than harmful, it is necessary for said news to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #7&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is also a responsibility that lays upon different groups of people to ensure that what they are allowing themselves to listen to, watch, etc. is of good and sound morality. There is the obligation of the listener to avoid social communications that would cause “spiritual harm”.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #9&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the problem of youth, and ensuring that they receive information from social communications in moderation and under the supervision of teachers, parents, etc. Youth should be going to these educators with questions, but the educators should also be diligent in ensuring that what the youth are listening to are too of high morality.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter Two: On the Pastoral Activity of the Church (#13–22)===
# Chapter II of ''Inter mirifica'' showcases a positive view of media, as gifts of God and expresses the need for a healthy relationship between both parties. Because the Vatican Council sees that all forms of media (including radio, TV, newspaper and cinema) are very influential to all persons, the Council trusts that all media personnel will adhere to the teachings and desires of the Catholic Church (as described in Chapter one).
# There is a strong sense of responsibility and leadership that the Vatican Council expects all Church authorities to have. In doing so, all members of the Church are able to ensure a positive message of the Church in media, as well as a way for authorities to remove any harmful projects as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #13&lt;/ref&gt; These responsibilities include:
## The establishment of a Christian press.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #14&lt;/ref&gt;
## Bishops over-seeing media projects in their own dioceses.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #20&lt;/ref&gt;
## Teaching the Vatican's ideas of the media and the Church, with younger age groups, within seminaries and Catholic schools.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #16.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The overall relationship between the Catholic Church and the media, to the Vatican Council, is a way to help with the advancement of man's being and their religious journey. Therefore, through the use of media, all individuals are able to learn about the teachings of the Catholic Church and move towards truth and goodness.

===Appendices (#23–24)===
# The Council states in its conclusion of ''Inter mirifica'' that it looks forward to a relationship between Catholic authorities and all media personnel, that will result in the use of social media and communication to reflect the Council's principles and rules. With their instruction, all members of the Catholic Church will be able to confidently accept these regulations, which will lead to the good of the Catholic mission and all of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''Inter mirifica'', #24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects and aftermath of ''Inter mirifica''==
The document's immediate reception was fairly negative&lt;ref&gt;Norman P. Tanner, The Church and the World : ''Gaudium et spes'', ''Inter mirifica'' (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The document was heavily criticized for falling short of expectations, as well as failing to provide any new or different thoughts or instructions on social communications.&lt;ref&gt;Norman P. Tanner, The Church and the World : ''Gaudium et spes'', ''Inter mirifica'' (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), 111.&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the Council, in a brief assessment of the documents it had produced, the ''[[New York Times]]'' said this text had been &quot;generally condemned as inadequate and too conservative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doty|first1=Robert C.|title=Pope Paul Closes Vatican Council Amod Pageantry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/12/09/archives/pope-paul-closes-vatican-council-amid-pageantry-crowd-of-100000.html|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=New York Times|date=9 December 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sentiments have been the long-standing memories of the document, with these sentiments continuing 40 years following the decree.&lt;ref&gt;Norman P. Tanner, The Church and the World : ''Gaudium et spes'', ''Inter mirifica'' (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the document did provide the beginning stages for further Church instructions on social communications, with the further documents of ''[[Communio et Progressio]]'' and ''[[Aetatis Novae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Norman P. Tanner, The Church and the World : ''Gaudium et spes'', ''Inter mirifica'' (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, from the document emerged World Social Communication Day, which was created by the Second Vatican Council to provide an annual message for the church to its people and the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/messages/communications/documents/hf_p-vi_mes_19670507_i-com-day_en.html World Social Communications Day], accessed September 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] vigorously promoted responsibility and positive goals in Social Communication not only in person but through messages given on this religious festival&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/messages/communications/documents/hf_jp-ii_mes_20050124_world-communications-day_en.html &quot;The Communications Media: At the Service of Understanding Among Peoples&quot;], accessed September 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and through supporting the [[Pontifical Council for Social Communications]].

==Later documents==
As mentioned previously, in the follow up and expansion of ''Inter mirifica'', the document ''[[Communio et progressio]]'' was later written in 1971&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/pccs/documents/rc_pc_pccs_doc_23051971_communio_en.html ''Communio et Progressio'', accessed September 25, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; as an update to ''Inter mirifica''. A further document, ''[[Aetatis Novae]]'', was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/pccs/documents/rc_pc_pccs_doc_22021992_aetatis_en.htm Aetatis Novae, accessed September 25, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[John Paul II]] wrote his final [[apostolic letter]], ''[[The Rapid Development]]'', on the topic of social communications&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20050124_il-rapido-sviluppo_en.html The Rapid Development, accessed September 25, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his message &quot;The Priest and Pastoral Ministry in a Digital World: New Media at the Service of the Word&quot; to priests for the 44th World Communications Day (16 May 2010), Pope [[Benedict XVI]] called for them to become [[digital citizens]] and engage with the [[information society]], saying, &quot;Priests stand at the threshold of a new era: as new technologies create deeper forms of relationship across greater distances, they are called to respond pastorally by putting the media ever more effectively at the service of the Word.... Who better than a priest, as a man of God, can develop and put into practice, by his competence in current digital technology, a pastoral outreach capable of making God concretely present in today’s world and presenting the religious wisdom of the past as a treasure which can inspire our efforts to live in the present with dignity while building a better future?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/communications/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20100124_44th-world-communications-day_en.html The Priest and Pastoral Ministry in a Digital World: New Media at the Service of the Word], [[Benedict XVI]], 24 January 2010, accessed 25 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dignitatis humanae''''' ({{lang-la|Of the Dignity of the Human Person}}{{efn|The document is known by its ''[[incipit]]'', the first words of the document in the original [[Latin]] text, as is customary for similar [[Catholic Church]] documents.}}) is the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s '''Declaration on Religious Freedom'''.&lt;ref&gt;The full text of a translation into English is available from the [https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html Holy See's website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211202206/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html |date=February 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of the council's stated intention &quot;to develop the doctrine of recent popes on the inviolable rights of the human person and the constitutional order of society&quot;, ''Dignitatis humanae'' spells out the church's support for the protection of religious liberty. It set the ground rules by which the church would relate to secular states, and in effect repudiated the traditional principle that &quot;[[error has no rights]]&quot;, i.e., that non-Catholics did not deserve civil or political rights.

The passage of this measure by a vote of 2,308 to 70 is considered by many to be one of the most significant events of the council.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Thus, during the final vote on the morning of December 7 (when the fathers had to choose between a simple approval or disapproval of the last draft), Lefebvre was one of the 70&amp;nbsp;— about 3 percent of the total&amp;nbsp;— who voted against the schema.&quot; [http://www.catholicculture.org/docs/doc_view.cfm?recnum=857 Marcel Lefebvre: Signatory to ''Dignitatis humanae''], by Brian Harrison&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration was promulgated by Pope Paul VI on December 7, 1965.

''Dignitatis humanae'' became one of the key points of dispute between the Vatican and traditionalists such as Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] who argued that the council document was incompatible with previous authoritatively stated Catholic teaching.

Historically, the ideal of Catholic political organization was a tightly interwoven structure of the Catholic Church and secular rulers generally known as [[Christendom]], with the Catholic Church having a favoured place in the political structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Concise History of the Catholic Church|last = Bokenkotter|first = Thomas J|publisher = Doubleday|year = 2004|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1520, [[Pope Leo X]] in the papal bull ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' had condemned the proposition &quot;That heretics be burned is against the will of the Spirit&quot; as one of a number of errors that were &quot;destructive, pernicious, scandalous, and seductive to pious and simple minds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swinburne|first1=Richard|title=Revelation: From Metaphor to Analogy|date=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191519529|pages=216|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhEAPsPQbMUC&amp;pg=PA216|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beinert|first1=Wolfgang|title=Verbindliches Zeugnis|date=1992|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|isbn=9783451236259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FPssCvqPkoC&amp;pg=PA196|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoose|first1=Bernard|title=Received Wisdom?: Reviewing the Role of Tradition in Christian Ethics|date=1994|publisher=Geoffrey Chapman|isbn=9780225667394|pages=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0gfXAAAAMAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ideal was challenged by the [[Protestant Reformation]], the rise of [[nation-states]] and [[the Enlightenment]]. The [[French Revolution]], the failed radical [[Revolutions of 1848]] and the loss of the [[Papal States]] traumatized many Catholic leaders, who held on to traditional ideas of relations with the secular powers.

[[Pope Pius IX]] had condemned the idea of abstract religious freedom. [[Pope Leo XIII]], who had established working relationships with both the French and German secular statesmen, issued the bull ''[[Testem benevolentiae nostrae]]'' against the [[Americanism (heresy)|Americanist heresy]], alleged by some to be a specifically European problem wherein the attempt was made to apply democratic concepts and American models of church–state relations to Catholic Church governance in Europe.

====The Spanish model====
The result was that as of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church–state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Spain]] (''nacionalcatolicismo''), where the Catholic Church:
*was officially recognized and protected by the state,
*had substantial control over social policy, and
*had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[concordat]].
It had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but to support legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those religions.

===John Courtney Murray===

The Spanish approach to church–state relations was problematic for many [[Roman Catholicism in the United States|American Catholics]]. By the mid-20th century, the Catholic Church in the United States had managed to overcome much of the deeply held anti-Catholic belief that marked the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] movements of the 19th century, partly fuelled by concerns about church–state separation. The prohibition of the establishment of a state church, required by the Bill of Rights, had allowed the construction of an extensive network of Catholic educational, health-care and social service institutions. But some, following the view of the influential priest and economist [[John A. Ryan]], believed that established Catholic teachings conflicted with the American experience of religious freedom, holding that if Catholics ever became the majority group, they would be bound to enact, if possible, the kind of church–state relationship that existed in countries such as Spain.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The arrangements in the United States were permissible only as long as the other model was not politically feasible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

By the early 1940s, however, the Jesuit theologian [[John Courtney Murray]] perceived that the most important coming challenge was [[secularism]], a challenge that could best be confronted by many faith communities working together. The American view of separate church and state led to understandable mistrust of the motives of a quickly growing American Catholic community. Murray began to develop a view based on the American experience, where a government limited by law protects the liberty of all religious communities equally, while the church pursues its aims by exercising its influence in society in general, without relying on government intervention to enforce the church's beliefs.&lt;!--this can be made more accurate--&gt; This view was developed in a series of articles in such Catholic journals as ''America'', while Joseph Fenton,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acton.org/publicat/books/liberty/hmention1.html John Courtney Murray and the American Catholic Experience] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525104724/http://www.acton.org/publicat/books/liberty/hmention1.html |date=2006-05-25 }} by Michael Tortolani, [[Acton Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; as editor of the ''American Ecclesiastical Review,'' defended the traditional view and asserted that Murray's views contradicted essential Catholic teachings. In 1954 Murray's ideas were censored by the Secretary of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] and he ceased publishing works on this specific topic until his vindication by Vatican II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://novusordowatch.org/2013/04/murray-religious-liberty-vatican2/|title=John Courtney Murray's Religious Liberty Error is Doctrine of Vatican II|date=2013-04-01|website=Novus Ordo Watch|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vatican II and religious freedom==

===Preparation and first session (1962)===
The initial conflict was regarding just what model of religious freedom was to be put before the council, with the traditionalists calling for religious tolerance but claiming that an abstract right to religious liberty was [[relativist]]ic.&lt;ref name=&quot;sspx.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sspx.org/archbishop_lefebvre/ab_lefebvre_preparing_the_council.htm |title=Archbishop Lefebvre Preparing the Council |access-date=2011-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010215803/http://www.sspx.org/archbishop_lefebvre/ab_lefebvre_preparing_the_council.htm |archive-date=2011-10-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the council both the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] led by Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the Theological Commission (led by Cardinal [[Alfredo Ottaviani]]){{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} introduced revised drafts of statements to the Central Commission. Pope John XXIII in July appointed an ad hoc joint committee to resolve differences and Bea's &quot;Unity&quot; submitted a revised draft. Negotiations between the various commissions broke down after this point.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The first session concentrated mainly on [[liturgy]] and on the nature of the church. A declaration on religious freedom, largely drawn from the &quot;Unity&quot; draft, was made part (chapter V) of the schema on [[Ecumenism]]; the bishops did not have time to get to it. On January 13, after the close of the first session, Bea indicated at a talk at [[Pro Deo University]] in Rome that he intended to prepare a constitution on human freedom for the next session, to make sure the issue would not go away.

'''Vichy''' ({{lang-oc|Vichèi}}) is a city in the [[Allier]] [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]] in central [[France]], in the historic province of [[Bourbonnais]].

It is a [[Spa town|spa]] and [[resort town]] and in [[World War II]] was the [[seat of government]] of [[Vichy France]] from 1940 to 1944. The term ''Vichyste'' indicated collaboration with the Vichy regime, often carrying a pejorative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:fr:vichyste|vichyste]] on French ''[[Wiktionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Etymology|Toponymy|Names}}

==Name==
Vichy is the French form of the [[Occitan language|Occitan]] name of the town, ''{{lang|oc|Vichèi}}'', of uncertain etymology. [[Albert Dauzat|Dauzat]] &amp; al. have proposed that it derived from an unattested [[Latin]] name (''{{lang|la|Vippiacus}}'') referencing the most important regional landowner (presumably a &quot;Vippius&quot;) during the time of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[list of Roman emperors|emperor]] [[Diocletian]]'s administrative reorganizations and land surveys at the end of the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Dauzat |first1=Albert |display-authors=1 |last2=Rostaing |first2=Charles |author-link1=Albert Dauzat |author-link2=Charles Rostaing |title=Dictionnaire Étymologique des Noms de Lieux en France |trans-title=Etymological Dictionary of Names of Locations in France |date=1963 |publisher=Guénégaud |location=Paris |language=fr }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Vichy may be pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|ʃ|i}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|iː|ʃ|i}} in either [[American English|American]] or [[British English]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Vichy, ''n''. |title=Oxford English Dictionary |contribution-url=https://oed.com/view/Entry/223168 |url=https://oed.com |date=1917 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Vichy |title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |contribution-url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Vichy |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] |date=2019 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; its usual French pronunciation is {{IPA-fr|viʃi|}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Vichy {{!}} Definition|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/vichy|access-date=20 November 2020|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pronunciation of the Occitan name ''{{lang|oc|Vichèi}}'' is {{IPA-oc|viˈʃe|}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In French, the present [[demonym]] for residents of Vichy is ''{{lang|fr|Vichyssoise}}'' for women and ''{{lang|fr|Vichyssois}}'' for men or mixed groups. Until the 18th century, it was also common to use ''{{lang|fr|Vichois}}''(''e''), which derived from the Occitan name of the town.

== Geography ==
Vichy lies on the banks of the [[Allier River]]. The source of the Allier is in the nearby [[Massif Central]] plateau which lies only a few miles to the south, near the region's capital, [[Clermont-Ferrand]].

The historical existence of volcanic activity in the Massif Central is somewhat visually evident. Volcanic eruptions have happened for at least 150,000 years, but all volcanoes there have been dormant for at least 112 years. Volcanic activity in the area is the direct cause of the many thermal springs that exist in and around Vichy.

===Climate===
The city enjoys an inland [[oceanic climate]] that incorporates some characteristics of a [[mountain climate]] because of the nearby [[Massif Central]] and [[Alps]]. Heavy snows in the Massif Central often make roads impassable, but Vichy is low enough – about {{convert|249|m|ft|abbr=off}} above sea level – that the climate is more continental than mountain. Rainfall is moderate around Vichy, averaging about {{convert|779.5|mm|in|1}} annually.

== History ==

=== Roman era ===
The first known settlement at Vichy was established by [[Roman legion]]naries in 52{{nbsp}}BC. Returning south from their defeat at the [[Battle of Gergovia]] by the [[Gauls]] under [[Vercingetorix]], they found the [[hot springs|hot]] [[mineral springs]] beside the ''{{lang|la|Flumen Elaver}}'' (&quot;River Allier&quot;) and established the township of Aquae Calidae (Latin for &quot;Hot Waters&quot;). During the first two centuries AD, Vichy became fairly prosperous because of the [[Roman medicine|supposed medicinal value]] of the thermal springs.

=== Middle Ages ===
On 2 September 1344, [[John II of France]] ceded the noble fiefdom of Vichy to [[Peter I, Duke of Bourbon]]. On 6 December 1374, the last part of Vichy was acquired by [[Louis II, Duke of Bourbon]]. At that point Vichy was incorporated into the [[House of Bourbon]]. In 1410, a [[Celestinian]] monastery was founded with twelve monks. A building located above the Celestinian Spring is still visible.

In 1527, the House of Bourbon was incorporated into the French Kingdom. By the end of the 16th century, the mineral baths had obtained a reputation for having quasi-miraculous curing powers and attracted patients from the noble and wealthy classes. Government officials, such as Fouet and Chomel, began to classify the curing properties of the mineral baths.

=== Vichy's thermal baths ===
[[Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de Sévigné]] was a patient in 1676 and 1677 and would popularize Vichy's Thermal Baths through the written descriptions in her letters. The Vichy waters were said to have cured the paralysis in her hands, thus enabling her to take up letter-writing. In 1761 and 1762, [[Marie Adélaïde, Madame Quatrième|Adélaïde]] and [[Victoire of France]], the daughters of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], came to Vichy for the first time and returned in 1785. The bath facilities seemed extremely uncomfortable to them because of the muddy surroundings and insufficient access. When they returned to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], they asked their nephew [[Louis XVI]] to build roomier and more luxurious thermal baths, which were subsequently completed in 1787.

In 1799, [[Letizia Ramolino|Laetitia Bonaparte]], mother of [[Napoleon]], came to be cured with her son [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]]. Under the Empire, ''Le Parc des Sources,'' was created on the Emperor's orders. (Decree of Gumbinen of 1812).

Under Charles X, the great increase in patients wishing to be healed at the springs led to an expansion of the [[Hydrotherapy|hydrotheraputic]] facilities. [[Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte of France|Princess Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte]] expanded the ''Janson'' buildings under the plan of ''Rose – Beauvais'' (work completed in 1830). From 1844 to 1853, theatrical and poetry recitals were performed for the wealthy in the comfort of their own homes by {{ill|Isaac Strauss|fr|Isaac Strauss}}.

=== Vichy in style ===
By the 19th century Vichy was a ''station à la mode'', attended by many celebrities. However, it was the stays of [[Napoleon III]] between 1861 and 1866 that were to cause the most profound transformation of the city: [[Levee|dikes]] were built along the Allier, {{convert|13|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of landscaped gardens replaced the old marshes and, along the newly laid-out boulevards and the streets, chalets and pavilions were built for the Emperor and his court. Recreational pursuits were not spared; in view of the park, a large casino was built by the architect Badger in 1865. The Emperor would be the catalyst of the development of a small rail station, which multiplied the number of inhabitants and visitors by ten in fifty years.

After the [[Second French Empire]], the [[Belle Époque]] marked the second large construction campaign in Vichy. In 1903, the Opera House (l'Opéra), the Hall of Springs and a large bath designed in the eastern style were inaugurated. In 1900, the ''Parc des Sources'' was enclosed by a metal gallery which came from the [[World's Fair|World Fair]] of 1889. {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=off}} long, it is decorated by a ''frise de chardons'' and was completed by the ironworker Emile Robert. Many private mansions with varied architectural styles were erected during the first half of the 20th century.

Vichy welcomed 40,000 ''curistes'' in 1900, and that figure had risen to nearly 100,000 just before the onset of the [[First World War]]. ''La vie thermale'' had its heyday in the 1930s. The success in treating ailments that was attributed to the Vichy Baths led ''la Compagnie Fermière'' to enlarge the Baths again by creating the Callou and Lardy Baths. The [[Art Nouveau]]-style Opéra, inaugurated in 1903, accommodated all the great names on the international scene. Vichy became the summertime music capital of France, but the war of 1914 would put a brutal end to that development.

=== Vichy France – seat of the ''French State'', the pro-German collaborationist government ===
{{Main|Vichy France}}
[[File:Palais des Congrès-Opéra de Vichy 2016-07-09.JPG|thumbnail|alt=The Opera in Vichy|The Opera in Vichy. In this building, the parliament of the [[French Third Republic]] decided to grant full powers to Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]], thereby terminating the republican regime and inaugurating Vichy France (10 July 1940).]]
Following the armistice signed on 22 June 1940, the zone which was not occupied by the Germans took the name of the [[Vichy France|French State ''(État Français)'']] (as opposed to the traditional name, ''République Française'' or French Republic) and set up its capital in Vichy on 1 July, because of the town's relative proximity to [[Paris]] (4.5 hours by train) and because it was the city with the second largest hotel capacity at the time. Moreover, the existence of a modern telephone exchange made it possible to reach the whole world via phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Best of France: Sights, Hotels, Restaurants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDlokLWw_T0C&amp;pg=PA202|year=2012|publisher=Petit Futé|isbn=2-7469-6008-7|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July, the government took possession of many hotels. Six hundred members of the French Parliament (Appointed Members and Senators) would come to Vichy for the meeting of the Chambers. On 9 and 10 July, in the main auditorium of the Opera House, the members of Parliament voted for the end of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. The republican system was abolished, and the French State, with [[Philippe Pétain]] at its helm as Head of State, replaced it. Only 80 of the 600 members of Parliament voiced their opposition.

Starting from this date, Vichy would be, for more than four years, the ''de facto'' capital of the French State.  Paris was still the official capital, although the Vichy France government never operated from there.  This government is often called the Vichy Regime.  The term &quot;''Vichyste'',&quot; which designates partisans of this regime, should not be confused with &quot;''Vichyssois''&quot; which designates the inhabitants of the city. The latter term is sometimes used erroneously to designate Pétain's supporters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== ''Reine des villes d'eaux'' ===
The 1950s and 1960s would become the most ostentatious period for Vichy, complete with parading personalities, visits from crowned heads ([[T'hami El Glaoui|The Glaoui]], the Pasha of Marrakech, Prince [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Rainier III]] of [[Principality of Monaco|Monaco]]) and profits from a massive influx of North African French clients who holidayed in Vichy, spending lavishly. There were thirteen cinemas (which sometimes showed special previews), eight dance halls and three theatres. It was at this period that the station would take the title of &quot;''Reine des villes d'eaux''&quot; (Queen of the Spa Towns).

From June to September, so many French-Algerian tourists were arriving that it almost seemed like there was an airlift set up between Vichy-Charmeil and the airports of Algeria. Mayor [[Pierre Coulon]] (1950–1967) decided to create Lake Allier (10 June 1963) and Omnisports Park (1963–68), giving the city its current look.

=== Decline of Vichy ===
The [[Algerian War of Independence|war in Algeria]] (1950s-60s), which led to decolonization, marked once again a halt in the prosperity of this city, which from then on had to deal with much less favorable conditions. The need to continue to pay the debts incurred by the considerable investments that had been made in more prosperous times obligated the new mayor, [[Jacques Lacarin]] (1967–1989), the successor of Pierre Coulon, to adopt a much more careful policy of management.

=== Modern revival ===
[[Claude Malhuret]], former Minister of Human Rights, born in Strasbourg in 1950, was mayor from 1989 to 2017. He and [[Bernard Kouchner]] are the co-founders of [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]] (''Médecins Sans Frontières''). The city and its economic partners have concluded an important program of restoration and modernization. These projects include:
* creation of a vast pedestrian zone in the city center
* a program of modernization
* upgrading of hotels to the sector standards
* rebuilding and restoration of the thermal baths
* organization of a balneotherapy center dedicated to well-being
* development of the architectural heritage
* construction of a congress center within the old Casino, and
* restoration of the Opera
* rebuilding of the covered market, called &quot;Grand Marché&quot; (2006)
* restoration of the train station and surroundings (2009)
* restoration of the &quot;Rue de Paris&quot;, a main street in the city centre (2010)

== Economy ==
The city was first noted for its thermal cures in Roman times. Its waters come from springs such as the Vichy Celestins and Vichy Saint-Yorre.

[[File:Pastilles de Vichy - Moinet.jpg|thumb|200px|A tin of Vichy Pastilles]]
[[Vichy Pastilles]] (made in Vichy) are octagon-shaped candies made from soda contained in the spring waters.

The health and beauty business, with the laboratories of the [[L'Oréal]] company, also make it possible to publicize the city's name to a worldwide audience under the Vichy brand. (This French website discusses [http://www.prodimarques.com/sagas_marques/vichy/vichy.php the history of this brand].)

Unlike the neighbouring communes on the Allier such as industrial [[Montluçon]] and administrative seat [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]], Vichy's economy is centred on the tertiary sector, with companies like the [[Compagnie de Vichy]] developing the health and well-being sector to mitigate the decline of medical [[hydrotherapy]]. The local market, open on Sundays, attracts shoppers from tens of kilometres around.

The closing of two important local employers, the Manurhin company and the Sediver company, has reduced employment in the Vichy basin. Job creation by developing companies such as the NSE [[electronics]] company or the Satel call center company may not completely compensate for the removal of jobs which will result from this, despite the internet tour operator Karavel's establishment of a new call center in May 2005.

Nevertheless, the two most important employers of the city belong to the public sector: the hospital (1,120 employees), and the town hall (500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAIRIE DE VICHY|url=http://www.vichy-economie.com/annuaire-economique-vichy/detail?en=3177|website=Vichy-economie.com|publisher=Vichy Val d'Allier Développement|access-date=21 September 2016|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Since 1989 Vichy has been one of the 7 sites of the European Total Quality Institute (''Institut Européen de la Qualité Totale'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Total Quality Institute|url=http://www.ieqt.org/index.php?id=193|access-date=1 November 2014|website=Ieqt.org|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pôle Universitaire de Vichy'' (previously called Pôle Universitaire et Technologique Lardy), born from a project of thermal waste land rehabilitation and launched during the mid-nineties, is an economic priority. This {{convert|9000|m2|acre|abbr=on}} campus accommodates 600 students in the downtown area, in ten areas of study including the fields of biotechnology, international trade, multi-media and languages. The CAVILAM - Alliance Française&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cavilam.com/en/the-school/|title=The school|website=CAVILAM - Alliance Française|access-date=2020-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Centre of Live Approaches to Languages and the Media), created in Vichy in 1964, is located in the Pôle Universitaire de Vichy.

The Palace of the Congresses is a venue primarily for the conferences of trade associations and learned societies. The structure is {{convert|1800|m2|sqft|abbr=on|adj=on}} in area, including two plenary rooms and fifteen multi-use rooms. With 25,000 visitors yearly, the conferences must carry the economic role once held by the hydrotherapy industry, which today counts only 12,000 patients each year. The hydrotherapy business will now have to reorganise itself to take a less strict therapeutic-only role, and adapt to patients' stays shorter than the traditional three weeks.

=== Building projects ===
{{Update|section|date=September 2016}}
Under the authority of the local communities, much work is being done on building sites and projects, which will deeply modify Vichy in the years to come. The construction by the Hotel of the Community of Agglomeration in September 2005 on the old site of the &quot;Commercial City&quot; may precede the total restoration of the market hall &quot;''Le Grand Marché''&quot; (which would cost €5.9 Million) which would be delivered in September 2006. Other projects include the creation of a {{convert|12000|m2|sqft|abbr=on|adj=on}} mother-child centre in the hospital complex, the restoration of the spa façade (removal of the metal boarding to uncover the original style of 1862), the transformation of the spa into a multi-use center, creation of parks with fountains in place of parking lots, the demolition and the transformation of the buildings in a congested area to create an enterprise center intended to create 800 jobs (opened in early 2008), the construction of a new aquatic stadium including five basins (open since 2008), and motorway connection (opened in early 2015).

A landmark study of bison genetics performed by James Derr of Texas A&amp;M University corroborated this.&lt;ref name=&quot;buffalofieldcampaign.org&quot;&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.buffalofieldcampaign.org/habitat/documents2/Derr_American%20Bison%20-%20The%20Ultimate%20Genetic%20Survivor.pdf |title=American Bison: The Ultimate Genetic Survivor |author=Derr, James |conference=The Ecological Future of North American Bison |date=October 24, 2006 |access-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725231104/http://www.buffalofieldcampaign.org/habitat/documents2/Derr_American%20Bison%20-%20The%20Ultimate%20Genetic%20Survivor.pdf |archive-date=July 25, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Derr study was undertaken in an attempt to determine what genetic problems bison might face as they repopulate former areas, and it noted that bison seem to be adapting successfully, despite their apparent genetic bottleneck. One possible explanation for this might be the small amount of domestic cattle genes that are now in most bison populations, though this is not the only possible explanation for bison success.

[[File:Bisó de bosc.jpg|thumb|A [[wood bison]] around [[Coal River (Canada)|Coal River]] in Canada]]
In the study, cattle genes were also found in small amounts throughout most national, state and private herds. &quot;The hybridization experiments conducted by some of the owners of the five foundation herds of the late 1800s, have left a legacy of a small amount of cattle genetics in many of our existing bison herds.&quot; He also said, &quot;All of the state owned bison herds tested (except for possibly one) contain animals with domestic cattle mtDNA.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;buffalofieldcampaign.org&quot;/&gt;  It appears that the one state herd that had no cattle genes was the Henry Mountains bison herd; the Henry Mountain herd was started initially with transplanted animals from Yellowstone Park. However, the extension of this herd into the [[Book Cliffs]] of central Utah involved mixing the founders with additional bison from another source, so it is not known if the Book Cliffs extension of the herd is also free of cattle hybridization.

A separate study by Wilson and Strobeck, published in ''Genome'', was done to define the relationships between different herds of bison in the United States and Canada, and to determine whether the bison at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada and the Yellowstone Park bison herd were possibly separate subspecies. The Wood Buffalo Park bison were determined to actually be crossbreeds between plains and wood bison, but their predominant genetic makeup was that of the expected &quot;wood buffalo&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID10382295&quot; /&gt;  However, the Yellowstone Park bison herd was pure plains bison, and not any of the other previously suggested subspecies. Another finding was that the bison in the Antelope Island herd in Utah appeared to be more distantly related to other plains bison in general than any other plains bison group that was tested, though this might be due to [[genetic drift]] caused by the small size of only 12 individuals in the founder population. A side finding of this was that the Antelope Island bison herd appears to be most closely related to the Wood Buffalo National Park bison herd, though the Antelope Island bison are actually plains bison.

In order to bolster the genetic diversity of the American bison the National Parks Service alongside the Department of the Interior announced on 7 May 2020 the 2020 Bison Conservation Initiative. This initiative focuses on maintaining the genetic diversity of the metapopulation rather than individual herds. Small populations of bison are at considerably larger risk due to their decreased gene pool and are susceptible to catastrophic events more so than larger herds. The 2020 Bison Conservation Initiative aims to translocate up to three bison every five to ten years between the Department of the Interior’s herds. Specific smaller herds will require a more intense management plan. Translocated bison will also be screened for any health defects such as infection of brucellosis bacteria as to not put the larger herd at risk.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;New Bison Conservation Initiative Focuses On Genetic Diversity | THE WILDLIFE SOCIETY&quot;.

==As a symbol==

===Native Americans===
[[File:Big-Medicine.jpg|thumb|right|Big Medicine (1933–1959) was a sacred white buffalo that lived on the [[National Bison Range]] (permanent display at the Montana Historical Society)]]
Among Native American tribes, especially the [[Plains Indians]], the bison is considered a sacred animal and religious symbol.  According to University of Montana anthropology and Native American studies professor S. Neyooxet Greymorning, &quot;The creation stories of where buffalo came from put them in a very spiritual place among many tribes.  The buffalo crossed many different areas and functions, and it was utilized in many ways. It was used in ceremonies, as well as to make tipi covers that provided homes for people, utensils, shields, weapons and parts were used for sewing with the sinew.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NA bison&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Jawort | first=Adrian | url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2011/05/09/genocide-other-means-us-army-slaughtered-buffalo-plains-indian-wars-30798 | title=Genocide by Other Means: U.S. Army Slaughtered Buffalo in Plains Indian Wars | newspaper=Indian Country Today | date=May 9, 2011 | access-date=April 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Sioux]] consider the birth of a [[white buffalo]] to be the return of [[White Buffalo Calf Woman]], their primary cultural prophet and the bringer of their &quot;Seven Sacred Rites&quot;.  Among the [[Mandan]] and [[Hidatsa]], the [[White Buffalo Cow Society]] was the most sacred of societies for women.

===North America===
The American bison is often used in North America in official seals, flags, and logos. In 2016, the American bison became the [[National symbols of the United States|national mammal of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2016/04/27/how-the-bison-once-nearing-extinction-lived-to-become-americas-national-mammal/|newspaper=Washington Post|author=Elahe Izadi|title=It's official: America's first national mammal is the bison|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bison is a popular symbol in the Great Plains states: Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming have adopted the animal as their official [[List of U.S. state mammals|state mammal]], and many sports teams have chosen the bison as their mascot. In Canada, the bison is the official animal of the province of [[Manitoba]] and appears on the Manitoba flag. It is also used in the official coat of arms of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].

Several American coins feature the bison, most famously on the reverse side of the &quot;[[Indian Head nickel|buffalo nickel]]&quot; from 1913 to 1938. In 2005, the [[United States Mint]] coined a nickel with a new depiction of the bison as part of its [[Westward Journey Nickel Series|&quot;Westward Journey&quot;]] series. The Kansas and North Dakota state quarters, part of the &quot;[[50 State Quarters|50 State Quarter]]&quot; series, each feature bison. The Kansas state quarter has only the bison and does not feature any writing, while the North Dakota state quarter has two bison. The Montana state quarter prominently features a bison skull over a landscape. The Yellowstone National Park quarter also features a bison standing next to a geyser.

Other institutions which have adopted the bison as a symbol or mascot include:&lt;!-- Hundreds if not thousands of institutions use the bison as a symbol. Please help keep this list manageable by limiting it to institutions of international, national, or regional significance. Locally significant institutions, such as secondary schools, are probably best not included here. --&gt;

{{Group theory sidebar |Finite}}
In [[mathematics]], an '''alternating group''' is the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of [[even permutation]]s of a [[finite set]]. The alternating group on a set of ''n'' elements is called the '''alternating group of degree ''n''''', or the '''alternating group on ''n'' letters''' and denoted by A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or Alt(''n'').

== Basic properties ==
For {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}}, the group A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[commutator subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 and has therefore [[factorial|''n''!]]/2 elements. It is the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the signature [[group homomorphism]] {{nowrap|sgn : S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → {1, −1} }} explained under [[symmetric group]].

The group A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[abelian group|abelian]] [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ 3}} and [[simple group|simple]] if and only if {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} or {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}}.&lt;!-- Note A3 is in fact a simple group of order 3. A1 and A2 are groups of order 1, so not usually called simple, and A4 has a non-identity proper normal subgroup so is not simple. --&gt;  A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the smallest non-abelian [[simple group]], having order 60, and the smallest non-[[solvable group]].

The group A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has the [[Klein four-group]] V as a proper [[normal subgroup]], namely the identity and the double transpositions {{nowrap|{ (),  (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23) },}} that is the kernel of the surjection of A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; onto {{nowrap|1=A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}. We have the [[exact sequence]] {{nowrap|1=V → A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In [[Galois theory]], this map, or rather the corresponding map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, corresponds to associating the [[Lagrange resolvent]] cubic to a quartic, which allows the [[quartic polynomial]] to be solved by radicals, as established by [[Lodovico Ferrari]].

== Conjugacy classes ==
As in the [[symmetric group]], any two elements of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; that are conjugate by an element of  A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; must have the same [[cycle decomposition (group theory)|cycle shape]]. The converse is not necessarily true, however. If the cycle shape consists only of cycles of odd length with no two cycles the same length, where cycles of length one are included in the cycle type, then there are exactly two conjugacy classes for this cycle shape {{harv|Scott|1987|loc=§11.1, p299}}.

Examples:
*The two [[permutation]]s (123) and (132) are not conjugates in A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, although they have the same cycle shape, and are therefore conjugate in S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
*The permutation (123)(45678) is not conjugate to its inverse (132)(48765) in A&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, although the two permutations have the same cycle shape, so they are conjugate in S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Relation with symmetric group ==
:''See [[Symmetric group#Relation with alternating group | Symmetric group]]''.

== Generators and relations ==
A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is generated by 3-cycles, since 3-cycles can be obtained by combining pairs of transpositions. This generating set is often used to prove that A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is simple for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}}.

== Automorphism group ==

! &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Aut}(\mathrm{A}_n)&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Out}(\mathrm{A}_n)&lt;/math&gt;
|- align=center
| &lt;math&gt;n\geq 4, n\neq 6&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}_n&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;
|- align=center
| &lt;math&gt;n=1,2&lt;/math&gt;

|- align=center

|- align=center
| &lt;math&gt;n=6&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}_6 \rtimes \mathrm{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{Z}_2 \times \mathrm{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 3}}, except for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}, the  [[automorphism group]] of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, with [[inner automorphism group]] A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and [[outer automorphism group]] Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; the outer automorphism comes from conjugation by an odd permutation.

For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}} and 2, the automorphism group is trivial. For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} the automorphism group is Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with trivial inner automorphism group and outer automorphism group Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The outer automorphism group of A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Klein four-group|the Klein four-group]] {{nowrap|1=V = Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and is related to [[Symmetric group#Automorphism group|the outer automorphism of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The extra outer automorphism in A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; swaps the 3-cycles (like (123)) with elements of shape 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (like (123)(456)).

== Exceptional isomorphisms ==
There are some [[exceptional isomorphism]]s between some of the small alternating groups and small [[groups of Lie type]], particularly [[projective special linear group]]s. These are:
* A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to PSL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3)&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson-p78&quot;&gt;Robinson (1996), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=lqyCjUFY6WAC|page=78|text=PSL}} p. 78]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[symmetry group]] of chiral [[tetrahedral symmetry]].
* A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to PSL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(4), PSL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5), and the symmetry group of chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. (See&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson-p78&quot;/&gt;  for an indirect isomorphism of {{nowrap|PSL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) → A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} using a classification of simple groups of order 60, and [[Projective linear group#Action on p points|here]] for a direct proof).
* A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to PSL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(9) and PSp&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2)'.
* A&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to PSL&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2).

More obviously, A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to the [[cyclic group]] Z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are isomorphic to the [[trivial group]] (which is also {{nowrap|1=SL&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') = PSL&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'')}} for any ''q'').
&lt;!-- This part has a few errors, comment out until they are fixed. A4 is not perfect, SL(4,2)=PSL(4,2)=A8 is not the Schur cover of A8 --&gt;
&lt;!--
The associated extensions &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SL}_n(q) \to \operatorname{PSL}_n(q)&lt;/math&gt; are [[universal perfect central extension]]s for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_4,\mathrm{A}_5,\mathrm{A}_8&lt;/math&gt;, by uniqueness of the universal perfect central extension;
for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(9) \cong \mathrm{A}_6&lt;/math&gt;, the associated extension is a perfect central extension, but not universal: there is a 3-fold [[Schur multiplier|covering group]].

[[File:Compound of five tetrahedra.png|thumb|Compound of five tetrahedra. &lt;math&gt;A_5&lt;/math&gt; acts on the dodecahedron by permuting the 5 inscribed tetrahedra. Even permutations of these tetrahedra are exactly the symmetric rotations of the dodecahedron and characterizes the &lt;math&gt;A_5 &lt; SO_3(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; correspondence.]]

&lt;math&gt;A_5&lt;/math&gt; is the group of isometries of a dodecahedron in 3 space, so there is a representation &lt;math&gt;A_5\to SO_3(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;

In this picture the vertices of the polyhedra represent the elements of the group, with the center of the sphere representing the identity element. Each vertex represents a rotation about the axis pointing from the center to that vertex, by an angle equal to the distance from the origin, in radians. Vertices in the same polyhedron are in the same conjugacy class. Since the conjugacy class equation for &lt;math&gt;A_5&lt;/math&gt; is 1+12+12+15+20=60, we obtain four distinct (nontrivial) polyhedra.

The vertices of each polyhedron are in bijective correspondence with the elements of its conjugacy class, with the exception of the conjugacy class of (2,2)-cycles, which is represented by an icosidodecahedron on the outer surface, with its antipodal vertices identified with each other. The reason for this redundancy is that the corresponding rotations are by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; radians, and so can be represented by a vector of length &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; in either of two directions. Thus the class of (2,2)-cycles contains 15 elements, while the icosidodecahedron has 30 vertices.

The two conjugacy classes of twelve 5-cycles in &lt;math&gt;A_5&lt;/math&gt; are represented by two icosahedra, of radii &lt;math&gt;2\pi/5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4\pi/5&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The nontrivial outer automorphism in &lt;math&gt;\text{Out}(A_5)\simeq Z_2&lt;/math&gt; interchanges these two classes and the corresponding icosahedra.

==Subgroups==
A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the smallest group demonstrating that the converse of [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] is not true in general: given a finite group ''G'' and a divisor ''d'' of {{abs|''G''}}, there does not necessarily exist a subgroup of ''G'' with order ''d'': the group {{nowrap|1=''G'' = A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, of order 12, has no subgroup of order 6. A subgroup of three elements (generated by a cyclic rotation of three objects) with any distinct nontrivial element generates the whole group.

For all {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 4}}, A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has no nontrivial (that is, proper) [[normal subgroup]]s. Thus, A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[simple group]] for all {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 4}}. A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the smallest [[solvable group|non-solvable group]].

==Group homology==
{{see also|Symmetric group#Homology}}
The [[group homology]] of the alternating groups exhibits stabilization, as in [[stable homotopy theory]]: for sufficiently large ''n'', it is constant. However, there are some low-dimensional exceptional homology. Note that the [[Symmetric group#Homology|homology of the symmetric group]] exhibits similar stabilization, but without the low-dimensional exceptions (additional homology elements).

=== H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: Abelianization ===
The first [[homology group]] coincides with [[abelianization]], and (since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_n&lt;/math&gt; is [[perfect group|perfect]], except for the cited exceptions) is thus:
:&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{A}_n,\mathrm{Z})=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n=0,1,2&lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{A}_3,\mathrm{Z})=\mathrm{A}_3^{\text{ab}} = \mathrm{A}_3 = \mathrm{Z}/3&lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{A}_4,\mathrm{Z})=\mathrm{A}_4^{\text{ab}} = \mathrm{Z}/3&lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{A}_n,\mathrm{Z})=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 5&lt;/math&gt;.

This is easily seen directly, as follows. &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_n&lt;/math&gt; is generated by 3-cycles – so the only non-trivial abelianization maps are &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_n \to \mathrm{C}_3,&lt;/math&gt; since order 3 elements must map to order 3 elements – and for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 5&lt;/math&gt; all 3-cycles are conjugate, so they must map to the same element in the abelianization, since conjugation is trivial in abelian groups. Thus a 3-cycle like (123) must map to the same element as its inverse (321), but thus must map to the identity, as it must then have order dividing 2 and 3, so the abelianization is trivial.

For &lt;math&gt;n &lt; 3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_n&lt;/math&gt; is trivial, and thus has trivial abelianization. For &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_4&lt;/math&gt; one can compute the abelianization directly, noting that the 3-cycles form two conjugacy classes (rather than all being conjugate) and there are non-trivial maps &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_3 \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{C}_3&lt;/math&gt; (in fact an isomorphism) and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_4 \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{C}_3.&lt;/math&gt;

=== H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: Schur multipliers ===
{{main|Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups}}
The [[Schur multiplier]]s of the alternating groups A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (in the case where ''n'' is at least 5) are the cyclic groups of order 2, except in the case where ''n'' is either 6 or 7, in which case there is also a triple cover. In these cases, then, the Schur multiplier is (the cyclic group) of order 6.&lt;ref name=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;{{citation|first=Robert |last=Wilson |author-link=Robert Arnott Wilson |date=October 31, 2006 |url=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs.html |title=The finite simple groups, 2006 versions |chapter=Chapter 2: Alternating groups |chapter-url=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs_files/alt.ps |postscript=, 2.7: Covering groups |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522121819/http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs.html |archive-date=May 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were first computed in {{Harv|Schur|1911}}.

:&lt;math&gt;H_2(\mathrm{A}_n,\mathrm{Z})=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n = 1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;H_2(\mathrm{A}_n,\mathrm{Z})=\mathrm{Z}/2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n = 4,5&lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;H_2(\mathrm{A}_n,\mathrm{Z})=\mathrm{Z}/6&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n = 6,7&lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;H_2(\mathrm{A}_n,\mathrm{Z})=\mathrm{Z}/2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 8&lt;/math&gt;.

The numbers in the right column are the [[Inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]] numbers {{OEIS|A034968}}, which have the same [[Parity (mathematics)|parity]] as the permutation.]]
In [[mathematics]], when ''X'' is a [[finite set]] with at least two elements, the [[permutation]]s of ''X'' (i.e. the [[bijective function]]s from ''X'' to ''X'') fall into two classes of equal size: the '''even permutations''' and the '''odd permutations'''. If any [[total ordering]] of ''X'' is fixed, the '''parity''' ('''oddness''' or '''evenness''') of a permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''X'' can be defined as the parity of the number of [[inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversions]] for&amp;nbsp;''σ'', i.e., of pairs of elements ''x'', ''y'' of ''X'' such that {{nowrap|''x'' &lt; ''y''}} and {{nowrap|''σ''(''x'') &gt; ''σ''(''y'')}}.

The '''sign''', '''signature''', or '''signum''' of a permutation&amp;nbsp;''σ'' is denoted sgn(''σ'') and defined as +1 if ''σ'' is even and &amp;minus;1 if ''σ'' is odd. The signature defines the '''alternating [[character (mathematics)|character]]''' of the [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Another notation for the sign of a permutation is given by the more general [[Levi-Civita symbol]] (''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''&lt;/sub&gt;), which is defined for all maps from ''X'' to ''X'', and has value zero for [[bijection | non-bijective maps]].

The sign of a permutation can be explicitly expressed as
:{{math|1=sgn(''σ'') = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''N''(''σ'')&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;!-- do not use &lt;math&gt; here.  see https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1594#c4 --&gt;
where ''N''(''σ'') is the number of [[inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]]s in&amp;nbsp;''σ''.

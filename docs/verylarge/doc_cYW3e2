These lands were claimed by Europeans for the first time when [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]] was granted the charter for the colony of Maryland by [[Charles I of England]].&lt;ref name=centuries/&gt;{{rp|9}} However, it was not until 1688 that the first tract of land in what is now Montgomery County was granted by the Calvert family to an individual colonist, a wealthy and prominent early Marylander named [[Henry Darnall]]. He and other early claimants had no intention of settling their families. They were little more than speculators, securing grants from the colonial leadership and then selling their lands in pieces to settlers. Thus, it was not until approximately 1715 that the first British settlers began building farms and plantations in the area.&lt;ref name=centuries/&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

These earliest settlers were English or Scottish immigrants from other portions of Maryland, German settlers moving down from Pennsylvania, or [[Quakers]] who came to settle on land granted to a convert named James Brooke in what is now [[Brookeville, Maryland|Brookeville]]. Most of these early settlers were small farmers, growing wheat and a variety of other subsistence crops in addition to the region's main cash crop, tobacco. Many of the farmers owned slaves. They transported the tobacco they grew to market through the Potomac River port of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]].&lt;ref name=centuries/&gt;{{rp|19–21}} Sparsely settled, the area's farms and taverns were nonetheless of strategic importance as access to the interior. General [[Edward Braddock]]'s army traveled through the county on the way to its disastrous defeat at [[Fort Duquesne]] during the [[French and Indian War]].&lt;ref name=centuries/&gt;{{rp|23}}

Like other regions of the American colonies, the region that is now Montgomery County saw protests against British taxation in the years before the [[American Revolution]]. In 1774, local residents met at Hungerford's Tavern and agreed to break off commerce with Great Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacMaster |first1=Richard K. |last2=Hiebert |first2=Ray Eldon |title=A Grateful Remembrance: The Story of Montgomery County, Maryland 1776–1976 |date=1976 |publisher=Montgomery County Government and Montgomery County Historical Society |location=Rockville, MD |isbn=978-0-9643819-8-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} Following the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], representatives of the area helped to draft the new state constitution and began to build a Maryland free of proprietary control.&lt;ref name=centuries/&gt;{{rp|28}}

===Founding===
By 1776, there was a growing movement to form a new, strong federal government, with each colony retaining the authority to govern its local affairs.&lt;ref name= hmc&gt;Farquhar, Roger Brooke (1952). ''Historic Montgomery County, Old Homes and History''. Baltimore, Maryland: Monumental Printing Company. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Member of the Maryland Constitutional Convention [[Thomas S. Wootton]] thought that dividing large [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]] into three counties, each governed by elected representatives, would result in greater self-government.&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt;

When Wootton discussed his idea with the residents of southern Frederick County, the residents supported his idea for a different reason.&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt; At some point, almost everyone had needed to travel to the courthouse in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick Town]], and the travel cost and time was prohibitive.&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt; The residents wanted a county courthouse to be located closer to them.&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt;

On August 31, 1776, Wootton introduced a measure to form a new county from the southern portion of Frederick County.&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt;

{{Quote |text= ''Resolved,'' That after the first day of October, next, such part of the said county of Frederick as is contained within the bounds and limits following, to wit: beginning at the east side of the mouth of [[Rock Creek (Potomac River tributary)|Rock Creek]], on the [[Potomac River]], and running thence with the said river to the mouth of [[Monocacy River|Monocacy]], then with a straight line to [[Parr's Spring]], from thence with the lines of the county to the beginning shall be and is hereby erected into a new county called Montgomery County.&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt; }}

Wootton proposed naming the new county after the well-known [[Major General]] [[Richard Montgomery]], who had served in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;/&gt;{{rp|41}} Eight months prior, Montgomery had died in [[Quebec City]] while attempting an ultimately unsuccessful invasion of the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]].&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt; Montgomery had never actually set foot on the land that would bear his name.&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt;

Wootton also proposed forming a new county from the northwestern portion of Frederick County, named [[Washington County, Maryland|Washington County]], named after another well-known leader of the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[General officer|General]] [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt;

Several members of the Maryland Continental Convention opposed Wootton's proposal, and it was [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|tabled]].&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt; Six days later, Wootton pressed for his proposal again, and it passed by a slim majority. As a result, Montgomery County came into existence on October 1, 1776.&lt;ref name= hmc/&gt;

In 1777, the leaders of the new county chose as their county seat an area adjacent to Hungerford's Tavern near the center of the county, which became [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]] in 1801.&lt;ref name=centuries/&gt;{{rp|29–30}} When deciding its name, the original idea was to call it Wattsville, after [[Watts Branch (Potomac River tributary)|Watts Branch]], a stream that runs through the land. Because Watts Branch is a small stream, the idea was reconsidered, and the area was ultimately named Rockville after the nearby and larger [[Rock Creek (Potomac River tributary)|Rock Creek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THS Boyd&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyd |first=T.H.S. |title=The History of Montgomery County, Maryland from Its Earliest Settlement in 1650 to 1879 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_history_of_Montgomery_county,_Maryland,_from_its_earliest_settlement_in_1650_to_1879_.._(IA_historyofmontgom00boy).pdf |date=1879 |publisher=Regional Publishing Company |location=Clarksburg, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–54}}

For tax purposes, Montgomery County was divided into eleven districts, called [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]]s.

* Linganor Hundred (now [[Clarksburg, Maryland|Clarksburg]], [[Damascus, Maryland|Damascus]], and [[Hyattstown, Maryland|Hyattstown]]);

* Sugarland Hundred ([[Poolesville, Maryland|Poolesville]]).&lt;ref name=centuries/&gt;

The first court was held at Hungerford's Tavern on May 20, 1777. Court was held by Charles Jones, Samuel W. Magruder, Elisha Williams, William Deakins, Richard Thompson, James Offutt, and Edward Burgess, with Brook Beall as clerk. Clement Beall served as the county's first sheriff. The county's first courthouse was built soon thereafter, and the court was held at the new courthouse beginning in 1779.&lt;ref name=&quot;THS Boyd&quot;/&gt;{{rp|52–54}}

According to the 1790 [[census]], the county's first, 18,000 people lived in the county, of which about 35 percent were black.&lt;ref name=centuries/&gt;

Montgomery County supplied arms, food, and forage for the Continental Army during the Revolution, in addition to soldiers.&lt;ref name=centuries/&gt;{{rp|32}}

In 1791, portions of Montgomery County, including [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]], were ceded to form the new [[District of Columbia]], along with portions of [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], as well as parts of [[Virginia]] that were later [[District of Columbia retrocession|returned to Virginia]].

===19th century===
In 1828, construction on the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] commenced and was completed in 1850. Laborers were primarily Irish immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;/&gt;{{rp|101}} Throughout the 19th century, agriculture dominated the economy in Montgomery County, with [[slave]]s playing a significant role, though the vast majority of farmers owned 10 slaves or less rather than large plantations.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;/&gt;{{rp|152}} In the first half of the 19th century, low tobacco prices and worn-out soil caused many tobacco farms to be abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;/&gt;{{rp|113-116}} Crop production gradually shifted away from tobacco and toward wheat and [[maize|corn]]. Prior to the Civil War, Montgomery County allied itself with other slaveholding counties in southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;/&gt;{{rp|101}} Montgomery County was important in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement, especially among the Quakers in the northern part of the county near [[Sandy Spring]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;/&gt;{{rp|48}} [[Josiah Henson]] grew up as a slave on the Riley farm south of Rockville.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;/&gt;{{rp|154}} He wrote about his experiences in a memoir which became the basis for [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852). A slave cabin where he is believed to have spent time still stands at the end of a driveway off Old Georgetown Road.

Until 1860, only private schools existed in Montgomery County. Initially, schools for [[European American]] students were built. A school in Rockville for free African-Americans existed until 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Colored School in Rockville Closed |work=Washington Evening Star |date=June 25, 1866 |page=2 |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/HistArchive/?p_product=EANX-NB&amp;p_theme=ahnp&amp;p_nbid=W60L63JXMTQxNTQ1ODU0NS40NDMwNDU6MToxNToxMzIuMTc0LjI1NC4xNDU&amp;p_action=doc&amp;s_lastnonissuequeryname=2&amp;d_viewref=search&amp;p_queryname=2&amp;p_docnum=8&amp;p_docref=v2:13D5DA85AE05A305@EANX-NB-13DA7D3E9D7BB6D8@2402778-13D8D1135DBA7940@1-13DB07C8514F9848@}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another school for African-Americans was opened by 1877 in Rockville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The colored public school in Rockville, Md. has over a hundred pupils, some of whom live five miles from town, but walk to and from school regularly |work=Washington Evening Star |date=May 19, 1877 |page=5 |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/HistArchive/?p_product=EANX-NB&amp;p_theme=ahnp&amp;p_nbid=W60L63JXMTQxNTQ1ODU0NS40NDMwNDU6MToxNToxMzIuMTc0LjI1NC4xNDU&amp;p_action=doc&amp;s_lastnonissuequeryname=2&amp;d_viewref=search&amp;p_queryname=2&amp;p_docnum=18&amp;p_docref=v2:13D5DA85AE05A305@EANX-NB-13E1766904B3BC40@2406759-13E0BC92EA163350@4-13E48CD9F14A60B0@}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery County's proximity to the nation's capital and split sympathies to North and South resulted in it being occupied by Union forces during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The county was &quot;invaded&quot; on multiple occasions by Confederate and Union forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://civilwarstudies.org/articles/Vol_7/montgomery-county.shtm |title=Civil War Guide to Montgomery County, Maryland |author=Charles T.

The railroad spurred development at [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]], [[Kensington, Maryland|Kensington]], [[Garrett Park, Maryland|Garrett Park]] and [[Chevy Chase, Maryland|Chevy Chase]]. By providing a much-needed transportation link, it also greatly increased the value of farmland and spurred the development of a dairy industry in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;/&gt;{{rp|209-10}}

During the [[Jim Crow]] era, masked mobs of local white men carried out two separate lynchings of African-American men in Montgomery County on Rockville's courthouse lawn.

The county began with most legislative power in the hands of the Maryland state government, with a five-person Montgomery County Board of Commissioners who oversaw the administration of the county but could neither pass county laws nor enact policies.&lt;ref name=confused&gt;{{cite news |title=Many Confused By Charter Fight: Montgomery Plan Is Explained as Merely Opening Chance of Reform to Voters |first=Chester R. |last=Venemann |work=The Washington Post |date=August 31, 1942 |page=B11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, two-thirds of [[Arlington County, Virginia]] residents voted to appoint a county manager,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arlington Manager Plan Wins Handily: Voters Back Selection of Five Commissioners from County at Large |work=The Washington Post |date=November 5, 1930 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspiring activists in Montgomery County to advocate for the same. In 1935, a group of farmers meeting in [[Sandy Spring, Maryland|Sandy Spring]] decided that Montgomery County needed a new form of governance. The farmers were in favor of a professional county manager and a home-rule charter for Montgomery County.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;/&gt;{{rp|313–315}}

In 1936, the Montgomery County Civic Federation announced its support for a home-rule charter, a merit system for Montgomery County's employees, and a [[comptroller]] to administer the county's finances. The following year, the Montgomery County Civic Federation appointed [[Woodside Park, Montgomery County, Maryland|Woodside Park]]-resident Allen H. Gardener to head a committee to study the reorganization of the Montgomery County's government.

In October 1938, the Montgomery County Commissioners held a public hearing on the proposal. The Commissioners decided to authorize a study of the existing county government structure with the goal of suggesting recommendations.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;/&gt;{{rp|313–315}} In November 1938, the Commissioners selected the [[Brookings Institution|Brookings Institution for Government Research]] to conduct the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brookings Institution to Make Montgomery County Survey: Commissioners Limit Cost to $5,000; Report to Include Recommended Changes; Board is Unanimous in Acceptance |work=The Washington Post |date=November 30, 1938 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 720-page report opined that the county had outgrown its form of government.&lt;ref name=overhaul&gt;{{cite news |title=Overhaul Montgomery Setup, Brookings Report Recommends: Montgomery Setup, Brookings Report Recommends |first=James D. |last=Secrest |work=The Washington Post |date=March 16, 1941 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brookings Institution's study recommended the creation of a [[nonpartisan]] county council consisting of nine members representing defined districts of the county who could pass legislation, determine policy, and control over the administration of the county.&lt;ref name=overhaul /&gt; The county should hire a county administrator, create an independent comptroller in charge of county finances, consolidate welfare services, and establish a three-member non-political civil service commission.&lt;ref name=overhaul /&gt; Black children deserved better schools, and all children should receive military training and learn about democracy.

A professional consultant should reassess taxes, and the tax rate should be increased enough to retire the county's debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMaster and Hiebert&quot;/&gt;{{rp|313–315}} The Montgomery County Civic Federation praised the study for its comprehensiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brookings Montgomery Survey Praised |work=The Washington Post |date=March 17, 1941 |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The county commissioners appointed a citizen's committee to determine how to enact the study's recommendations.&lt;ref name=radical&gt;{{cite news |title=Officials Call Brookings Plan Radical: Would Scrap Time-Honored System, Assert Montgomery Heads |work=The Washington Post |date=August 20, 1941 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The county commissioners strongly criticized the recommendation to create a county council, both because the council would be nonpartisan and because each county resident would be able to vote for only one representative rather than for all nine.&lt;ref name=radical /&gt; Implementing some of the recommendations weeks later, the county commissioners appointed a permanent Board of Assessors, reorganized the Welfare Board, hired the a County Attorney and a purchasing agent, and hired sixteen police officers.

In 1942, Montgomery County Charter Committee was organized, which was formed primarily to circulate petitions to form a Charter Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Citizens Seek County Charter In Montgomery |work=The Washington Post |date=July 2, 1942 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter Board petitioned to form a county council with the power to pass laws without the consent of the Maryland General Assembly and with authority over the administration the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More Home Rule Called Charter Aim |work=The Washington Post |date=August 15, 1942 |page=12 |id={{ProQuest|151576558}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Maryland Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] did not explicitly denounce the charter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery Politicians Mum On Charter Vote Predictions |first=Chester R. |last=Venemann |work=The Washington Post |date=September 4, 1942 |page=B8 |id={{ProQuest|151465247}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; it issued a statement calling out the ostensibly nonpartisan movement for hidden partisan goals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Democrats Give Statement On Charter |work=The Washington Post |date=September 6, 1942 |page=X7 |id={{ProQuest|151471916}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that backers of the charter petition for their alleged personal and political attacks on the Democratic Party and its officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Democrats Spurn Truce in Charter Fight |work=The Washington Post |date=September 13, 1942 |page=SP8 |id={{ProQuest|151517856}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed Independent Party endorsed the charter, praising county residents' goal of improving their form of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery Independents Back Charter |work=The Washington Post |date=September 5, 1942 |page=16 |id={{ProQuest|151549333}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 1942 election, county residents voted in favor of forming a Charter Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery Now Faces Job Of Drafting County Charter|work=The Washington Post |date=November 5, 1942 |page=15 |id={{ProQuest|151518727}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the Charter Board released its draft charter.&lt;ref name=newcharter&gt;{{cite news |title=Board of 9 Men Would Rule Montgomery County Under Terms of New Charter |work=The Washington Post |date=April 12, 1943 |page=8 |id={{ProQuest|151647497}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The council would have nine unpaid members,&lt;ref name=&quot;anticharter&quot; /&gt; of which five would represent each of five single-member districts and four would represent the county at-large.&lt;ref name=newcharter /&gt; Council seats would be nonpartisan, each seat would be held for four years, and elections would occur every two years.&lt;ref name=newcharter /&gt; The council would have the power to enact legislation and hire a county manager, to whom all governmental department heads would report.&lt;ref name=newcharter /&gt; All sessions of the council would be open to the public.&lt;ref name=newcharter /&gt; The office of county treasurer would be abolished and replaced by a director of finance, who would be responsible for assessment and collection of taxes, assessments, and licenses, custody and disbursement of public funds and property, and preparation of monthly financial statements.&lt;ref name=newcharter /&gt; A department of public works, department of education, department of safety, department of welfare, and department of health would also be created.&lt;ref name=newcharter /&gt;

The Montgomery County Charter Board opened its campaign headquarters in Bethesda, to serve as an information center regarding the draft charter.&lt;ref name=chartercommittee&gt;{{cite news |title=Charter Committee Opens Headquarters in Montgomery |work=The Washington Post |date=May 16, 1944 |page=4 |id={{ProQuest|151720430}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter Board emphasized that the draft charter would allow for county affairs to be decided by local representatives rather than by a vote of members of the Maryland General Assembly who represent citizens of all parts of the state.&lt;ref name=chartercommittee /&gt; Another group opposing the draft charter opened its headquarters in Bethesda.&lt;ref name=anticharter&gt;{{cite news |title=Anticharter Unit Forms in Montgomery |work=The Washington Post |date=August 25, 1944 |page=9 |id={{ProQuest|151699677}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group said there was no good reason to abolish the functional state-level system already in place, and that the draft charter would increase taxes and establish heads of governmental agencies with indefinite terms who are not directly accountable to the public.&lt;ref name=anticharter /&gt; The group also said that making the council seats nonpartisan would go against the country's political history.&lt;ref name=anticharter /&gt; The editorial board of ''The Washington Post'' supported the draft charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery Charter |work=The Washington Post |date=April 17, 1943 |page=10 |id={{ProQuest|151651081}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Montgomery County League of Women Voters also endorsed the draft charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery Women Voters Back Charter |work=The Washington Post |date=March 25, 1944 |page=3 |id={{ProQuest|151732288}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a near-record turnout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Near-Record Vote Crowds Md. Polls |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=November 8, 1944 |page=5 |id={{ProQuest|151729229}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1946 vote to enact a home-rule charter failed by a vote of 14,471 to 13,270.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charter Plan In Montgomery Is Defeated |work=The Washington Post |date=November 9, 1944 |page=7 |id={{ProQuest|151729229}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the vote, proponents of the charter said they would not give up the fight.&lt;ref name=sudden&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr. Lee's Sudden Switch To The Support Of Home Rule

Several months later, Montgomery County Democratic Party leader Col. E. Brooke Lee said he would support Montgomery County home rule by way of an act of the Maryland state legislature.&lt;ref name=sudden /&gt; Lee proposed a bill to create a position of county supervisor, who would be in charge of routine county business, would appoint county employees subject to civil service rules and regulations, would supervise expenditures, and would prepare the operating and capital budgets.&lt;ref name=better&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Montgomery County Have Better Government Now? |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=July 28, 1945 |page=6 |id={{ProQuest|537422500}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill did not disband the county commissioners or create a county council.&lt;ref name=better /&gt; The bill passed the state legislature and was signed by Governor [[Herbert R. O'Conor]] in 1945.&lt;ref name=better /&gt; The county commissioners appointed Willard F. Day to the position.&lt;ref name=better /&gt;

In 1948, by a vote of 17,809 in favor and 13,752 against, voters approved a charter for a &quot;Council-Manager&quot; form of government, making Montgomery County the first home-rule county in Maryland.&lt;ref name=heavily&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery Votes Heavily For Charter: Montgomery Votes Charter |work=The Washington Post |date=November 3, 1948 |page=1 |id={{ProQuest|152056350}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter created an elected seven-member County Council with the power to pass local laws.&lt;ref name=heavily /&gt; All seven Council Members would be elected at-large by all county residents.&lt;ref name=expansion&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery Council Expansion Proposed |first=Lawrence |last=Feinberg |work=The Washington Post |date=April 24, 1968 |page=B1 |id={{ProQuest|143395883}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five would have to live in five different residence districts, while the other two could live anywhere within the county.&lt;ref name=expansion /&gt; The Council would serve as both the legislative and executive functions of the county.&lt;ref name=devised&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery Plan Devised: It Adds Full-Time, Elected President Of Council |last=Rovner |first=Sandy |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=August 7, 1967 |page=A7 |id={{ProQuest|534370489}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Council members would elect one of their own to serve as president of the Council.&lt;ref name=devised /&gt; The charter also authorized the hiring of a county manager, the top administrative official,&lt;ref name=newgovt&gt;{{cite news |title=A New Government In Montgomery County |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=January 19, 1949 |page=10 |id={{ProQuest|541928116}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; who could be dismissed by the Council after a public hearing.&lt;ref name=motion&gt;{{cite news |title=Charter Council Plan Set in Motion |first=Roger B. |last=Farquhar |work=The Washington Post |date=November 4, 1948 |page=4 |id={{ProQuest|152065714}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter created a department of public works, department of finance, and office of the county attorney, while it abolished the positions of county treasurer and police commissioner.&lt;ref name=motion /&gt; The first County Council was elected in 1949.&lt;ref name=newgovt /&gt;

====County executive====
In 1962, a county civic group advocated for the election of a county executive.&lt;ref name=bigchanges&gt;{{cite news |title=Citizens Group Urges Big Changes in County |first=Alan L. |last=Dessoff |work=The Washington Post |date=June 12, 1962 |page=B9 |id={{ProQuest|141595914}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's report said that the new position would give citizens another place to go if their concerns were refused by the Montgomery County Council.&lt;ref name=bigchanges /&gt; The group said that the fact that the county had four appointed county managers in thirteen years demonstrates that establishing the position in 1948 had not been a stunning success.&lt;ref name=bigchanges /&gt; The group also advocated for nonpartisan elections for council members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Citizens Propose Major Changes In Montgomery Government Plan |first=Alan L. |last=Dessoff |work=The Washington Post |date=December 10, 1962 |page=A1 |id={{ProQuest|141644784}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for the suggested changes in governance is the fact that the county's population had more than doubled since the governmental system had been established in 1948.&lt;ref name=bigchanges /&gt;

In 1966, the Montgomery County Council adopted a proposed charter amendment to create a new elected position of County Executive.&lt;ref name=decide&gt;{{cite news |title=Voters Will Decide On New Executive For Montgomery |first=James T. |last=Yenckel |work=The Washington Post |date=July 13, 1966 |page=C2 |id={{ProQuest|142810914}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elected to a four-year term, the County Executive could veto legislation passed by the County Council, although five members of the County Council could vote to overrule the veto.&lt;ref name=decide /&gt; All Council Members would continue to be at-large, but they would need to live in seven different residence districts.&lt;ref name=decide /&gt; Republicans favored a referendum on the proposed charter amendment, while Democrats favored it in principle but urged the specific amendment's defeat because the duties of the County Executive were not specific enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Republicans Push County Executive For Montgomery |first=Katharine |last=Gresham |work=The Washington Post |date=November 3, 1966 |page=G6 |id={{ProQuest|142725620}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery to Vote On Elected Executive: Party Stands Other Questions |first=Walter B. |last=Douglas |work=The Washington Post |date=October 16, 1966 |page=B2 |id={{ProQuest|142817467}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the referendum held in September 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Referendum Prepared on County Shift |work=The Washington Post |date=July 20, 1966 |page=C4 |id={{ProQuest|142824925}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; the referendum was defeated, with 57 percent of voters opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery County Unofficial Vote Tally |work=The Washington Post |date=November 10, 1966 |page=A9 |id={{ProQuest|142650577}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1967, the Montgomery County Council formed a commission to draft a charter amendment to elect a county executive.&lt;ref name=urged&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery Head Urged: Council Moves To Provide For County Executive |last=Rovner |first=Sandy |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=February 8, 1967 |page=A9 |id={{ProQuest|539432226}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission's plan was to separate the legislative and executive functions of government.&lt;ref name=devised /&gt; The county council would continue to be the legislative branch of county government, and an elected full-time County Executive who could veto legislation passed by the Council; it would take five votes by the Council to override a veto.&lt;ref name=fire&gt;{{cite news |title=Montgomery Charter Draws Little Fire: Center of Argument |first=Lawrence |last=Feinberg |work=The Washington Post |date=October 20, 1968 |page=D2 |id={{ProQuest|143430376}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The County Executive would hire a chief administrative officer to supervise the daily operations of the government.&lt;ref name=fire /&gt; All Council Members would be elected at-large by all county residents, but five of the seven would need to live in each of five different residential districts of substantially equal population.&lt;ref name=fire /&gt; In November 1968, the charter amendment was approved, with 53 percent of votes in favor.&lt;ref name=charterbacked&gt;{{cite news |title=Charter Backed in Montgomery: First County Executive To Be Elected In 2 Years |last=Rovner |first=Sandy |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=November 6, 1968 |page=C11 |id={{ProQuest|539353597}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first election for County Executive, held in 1970,&lt;ref name=charterbacked /&gt; Republican [[James P. Gleason]] defeated Democrat William W. Greenhalgh by a margin of 420 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Greenhalgh Concedes Race: For Montgomery Executive |work=The Washington Post |date=November 9, 1970 |page=C1 |id={{ProQuest|147858581}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1986, voters amended the Charter to increase the number of Council seats in the 1990 election from seven to nine. Now five members are elected by the voters of their council district and four are elected at-large. Each voter may vote for five council members; four at-large and one from the district in which they reside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/Content/culture/images/history.pdf |title=Montgomery County, Maryland: Our History and Government |access-date=July 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325141033/http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/Content/culture/images/history.pdf |archive-date=March 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Annexation====
In November 1995, the City of Takoma Park held a state-sponsored referendum asking whether the portions of the city in Prince George's County should be annexed to Montgomery County or vice versa. The majority of votes in the referendum were in favor of unification of the entire city in Montgomery County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In a Montgomery State of Mind, Takoma Park Votes to Unify |work=Washington Post |first=David |last=Montgomery |date=November 8, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following subsequent approval by both counties' councils and the [[Maryland General Assembly]], the county line was moved to include the entire city into Montgomery County (including territory in Prince George's County newly annexed by the city) on July 1, 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Substantial Changes to Counties and County Equivalent Entities: 1970-Present |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ctychng.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011115120727/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ctychng.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 15, 2001 |publisher=Census Bureau |access-date=August 8, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This added about 800 residents to Montgomery County's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=P.G.

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|507|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|491|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|16|sqmi}} (3.1%) is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_24.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=September 12, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913171515/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_24.txt|archive-date=September 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery County lies entirely inside the [[Piedmont plateau]]. The topography is generally rolling. Elevations range from a low of near sea level along the Potomac River to about 875 feet in the northernmost portion of the county north of Damascus. Relief between valley bottoms and hilltops is several hundred feet.

When Montgomery County was created in 1776, its boundaries were defined as &quot;beginning at the east side of the mouth of [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]] on [[Potomac River|Potowmac river]] [sic], and running with the said river to the mouth of [[Monocacy River|Monocacy]], then with a straight line to Par's spring, from thence with the lines of the county to the beginning&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;

The county's boundary forms a sliver of land at the far northern tip of the county that is several miles long and averages less than 200 yards wide. In fact, a single house on Lakeview Drive and its yard is sectioned by this sliver into 3 portions, each separately contained within Montgomery, Frederick and Howard Counties. These jurisdictions and Carroll County meet at a single point at Parr's Spring on [[Parr's Ridge]].

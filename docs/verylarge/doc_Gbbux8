Members of the upper social class bore the title ''[[boila]]'' (later ''[[boyar]]'').{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=8}} The nobility was divided onto ''small'' and ''great'' boilas.{{sfn|Sedlar|2011|p=59}}{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=74}} In the 10th century, there were three classes of boyars: the six ''great'' boilas, the ''outer'' boilas, and the ''inner'' boilas,{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=284}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Henning&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Henning |first=Joachim |date=2007 |title=Post-Roman Towns, Trade and Settlement in Europe and Byzantium: Byzantium, Pliska, and the Balkans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3oCI8BVxcB8C |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |pages=618–619 |isbn=9783110183580}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=74}} while in the mid-9th century there were twelve ''great'' boyars.{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=284}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury&quot;/&gt; The ''great'' boilas occupied military and administrative offices in the state,{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=73}} as well the council where they gathered for decisions on important matters of state.{{sfn|Sedlar|2011|p=59}}{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=75}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury&quot;/&gt;

''Bagaïns'' were the lesser class of the nobility,{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=73}}{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=8}} probably a military class which also participated in the council.{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=285}}{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=74}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury&quot;/&gt; The title ''[[Baghatur|bagatur]]'', once as ''bogotor'',{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=10}} is found in several instances within the inscriptions.{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=8, 10, 34–35}} It derives from Turkish ''bagadur'' (hero){{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=285}}{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=34–35}} and was a high military rank.{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=285}}{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=34–35}} The Bulgarian military commander who was defeated by the Croats in the [[Croatian–Bulgarian battle of 926|Battle of the Bosnian Highlands]] (926) was called [[Alogobotur]],{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=285}} which is actually a title comprised by ''alo'' (considered Turkic ''[[Alıp|alp, alyp]]''; chief) and ''bagatur''.{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=285}}

There are several title associations with uncertain meaning, such as ''boila kavkhan'', ''ičirgu boila'', ''kana boila qolovur'', ''bagatur bagain'', ''biri bagain'', ''setit bagain'' and ''ik bagain''.{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=74}}

''Kolober'' (or ''qolovur''), a rank title, is cited in two inscriptions,{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=10, 13}} and it derives from the Turkish term for a guide, ''golaghuz''.{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=285}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury&quot;/&gt; The title ''[[župan]]'', also once as ''kopan''{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=9}} in the inscriptions, was often mentioned together with the bearer's name.{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=9–10, 37–38, 448, 508}}{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=285}} They were traditionally seen as Slavic chiefs.{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=9}} It seems to have meant &quot;head of a clan-district&quot;, as among the South Slavs (Croats, Serbs) where it was more widely used, it meant &quot;head of a tribe&quot; with a high district and court function.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=164}}{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=285}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury&quot;/&gt;

The title ''[[tarkhan]]'' probably represented a high military rank, similar to the Byzantine ''[[strategos]]'', of the military governor of a province.{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=286}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury&quot;/&gt; The variations ''kalutarkan'' and ''buliastarkan'' are considered to be officers at the head of the ''tarkans''.{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=287}} Curta interpreted the title ''zhupan tarqan'' as &quot;''tarqan of (all the) zhupans''&quot;.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=164}}

Although it was not recorded on inscriptions, the title ''sampses'' is considered to be related to the royal court.{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=286}} The title ''tabare'' or ''iltabare'', which derives from the old Turkish ''ältäbär'', like ''sampses'' is not mentioned on inscriptions, but is related to the legates and ambassadors.{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=287}}

The [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]] listed Bulgarian legates at the [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|Council]] at Constantinople in 869–870. They were mentioned as Stasis, Cerbula, Sundica (''vagantur''=''bagatur''), Vestranna (''iltabare''), Praestizisunas (''campsis''), and Alexius Hunno (''sampsi'').{{sfn|Runciman|1930|p=288}}

=== Religion ===
Very little is known about the religion of the Bulgars,{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=250}}{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=207}} but it is believed to have been [[monotheism|monotheistic]]. In Greek language inscriptions from pagan Danube Bulgaria, Bulgar monarchs describe themselves as &quot;ruler from God&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=161–162}}{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=84–86}} indicating authority from a divine origin,{{sfn|Sedlar|2011|p=141}} and making an appeal to the deity's [[omniscience]].{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=273}} [[Presian]]'s inscription from [[Philippi]] (837) states:{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=12–13}}

{{bquote|When someone seeks the truth, God sees. And when someone lies, God sees that too. The Bulgars did many favors to the Christians (Byzantines), but the Christians forgot them. But God sees.}}

It is traditionally assumed that the God in question was the Turkic supreme sky deity, [[Tengri]].{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=84}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=161–162}} In the Chinese transcription as ''zhenli'', and Turkic as ''Tangara'' and ''Tengeri'', it represents the oldest known Turco-Mongolian word.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tengri&quot;/&gt; Tengri may have originated in the Xiongnu confederacy, which settled on the frontiers of China in the 2nd century BC. The confederacy probably had both pre-Turkic and pre-Mongolian ethnic elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tengri&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first1=Yves |last1=Bonnefoy |author-link1=Yves Bonnefoy |first2=Wendy |last2=Doniger |author-link2=Wendy Doniger |date=1993 |title=Asian Mythologies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4I-FsZCzJEC |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=315, 331 |isbn=9780226064567}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Turkish, the word for god, ''Tanrı'', derives from the same root.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercia&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=MacDermott |first=Mercia |author-link=Mercia MacDermott |date=1998 |title=Bulgarian Folk Customs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gh4IE6toGJMC |publisher=[[Jessica Kingsley Publishers]] |pages=21–22 |isbn=9781853024856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tengrism]] apparently engaged various shamanic practices.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=250}} According to [[Mercia MacDermott]], Tangra was the male deity connected with sky, light and the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercia&quot;/&gt; The cult incorporated Tangra's female equivalent and principle goddess, [[Umay]], the deity of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zhivkov |first=Boris |date=2015 |title=Khazaria in the Ninth and Tenth Centuries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Du2CAAAQBAJ |publisher=Brill |pages=78, 80, 112 |isbn=9789004294486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[tamgha]] [[File:Khans Dulo of Bulgaria.jpg|20px]], which can be frequently found in early medieval Bulgaria is associated with deity Tangra. However, its exact meaning and use remains unknown.{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=207}} The most sacred creatures to Tangra were horses and eagles, particularly white horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercia&quot;/&gt; Broze amulets with representations of the Sun, horses and other animals were found at Bulgar archeological sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercia&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=88}}{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=208}} This could explain the variety of Bulgars taboos, including those about animals.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=250}}

Ravil Bukharaev believed that such an autocratic and monotheistic religion{{mdash}}[[henotheism]],{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=83–84, 86}} as seen in the report by [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] (10th century) about the [[Oghuz Turks]], kindred to the Bulgars,&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bukharaev |first=Ravil |date=2014 |title=Islam in Russia: The Four Seasons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIy3AwAAQBAJ |publisher=Routledge |pages=80–82, 83 |isbn=9781136807930}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the acceptance of Islam  more natural and easier in Volga Bulgaria:&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Shnirelʹman|1996|p=30–31}}

{{bquote|If someone trouble befalls any of them or there happens any unlucky incident, they look out into the sky and summon: &quot;''Ber Tengre!''&quot;. In the Turkish language, that means, &quot;''by the One and Only God!''&quot;.}}

Another mention of Tengri is on the severely damaged Greek inscription found on a presumed [[altar]] stone near Madara,{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=84}} tentatively deciphered as &quot;Khan ''sybigi'' Omurtag, ruler from god...was...and made sacrifice to god Tangra...''itchurgu boila''...gold&quot;.{{sfn|Petkov|2008|p=11}} An Ottoman manuscript recorded that the name of God, in Bulgarian, was &quot;Tängri&quot;.{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=84}}

A piece of ethnographic evidence which has been invoked to support the belief that the Bulgars worshipped Tengri/Tangra is the relative similarity of the name &quot;Tengri&quot; to &quot;Tură&quot;, the name of the supreme deity of the traditional religion of the [[Chuvash people]], who are traditionally regarded as descendants of the Volga Bulgars.{{sfn|Tokarev A., ''et al.''|1987–1988}} Nevertheless, the Chuvash religion today is markedly different from Tengrism and can be described as a local form of [[polytheism]], due to pagan beliefs of the forest dwellers of [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] origin, who lived in their vicinity, with some elements borrowed from Islam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam&quot;/&gt;

[[Paganism]] was closely connected with the old clan system,{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=141}} and the remains of [[totemism]] and [[shamanism]] were preserved even after the crossing of Danube.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercia&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=86–89}} The [[Shumen Province|Shumen]] plate in the archaeological literature is often associated with shamanism.{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=208}} In the 9th century, it was recorded that before a battle the Bulgars &quot;''used to practice enchantments and jests and charms and certain auguries''&quot;.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=268}}{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=82}} [[Liutprand of Cremona]] reported that Baian, son of [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] (893–927), could through ''magicam didicisse'' transform into a wolf.{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=88}} [[Clement of Ohrid]] reported the worship of fire and water by the Bulgars,{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=83}} while in the 11th century [[Theophylact of Ohrid]] remembered that before the Christianization the Bulgars respected the Sun, Moon and the stars, and sacrificed dogs to them.{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=80}}

Allegedly, the Dulo clan had the dog as its sacred animal. To this today Bulgarians still use the expression &quot;he kills the dog&quot; to mean &quot;he gives the orders&quot;, a relic of the time when the Dulo Khan sacrificed a dog to the deity Tangra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercia&quot;/&gt; Remains of dog and deer have been found in Bulgars graves, and it seems the [[Wolves in folklore, religion and mythology#Turco-Mongolian|wolf]] also had a special mythological significance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim&quot;/&gt; The Bulgars were bi-ritual,{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=66}} either cremating or burying their dead,{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=67}}{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=157}} and often interred them with personal objects (pottery, rarely weapons or dress{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=157}}), food, and sacred animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercia&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=67}}{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=157}}

[[File:The Great Basilica Klearchos 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Partial reconstruction of the [[Great Basilica, Pliska|Great Basilica]] in the first capital of the [[Bulgarian Empire]], [[Pliska]].]]
Because of the cult of the Sun, the Bulgars had a preference for the south. Their main buildings and shrines faced south, as well their [[yurt]]s, which were usually entered from the south, although less often from the east. Excavations showed that Bulgars buried their dead on a north-south axis,{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=157}} with their heads to the north so that the deceased &quot;faced&quot; south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercia&quot;/&gt; The Slavs practiced only cremation, the remains were placed in urns, and like the Bulgars, with the conversion to Christianity [[inhumation|inhumed]] the dead on west-east axis.{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=158}} The only example of a mixed Bulgar-Slavic cemetery is in [[Istria, Constanța|Istria]] near ancient [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]], on the coast of the Black Sea.{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=159}}

D. Dimitrov has argued that the Kuban Bulgars also adopted elements of Iranian religious beliefs. He noticed Iranian influences on the cult of the former Caucasian Huns capital Varachan ([[Balanjar]]), making a religious syncretism between the principal Turkic deity Tengri and the Iranian sun god [[Hvare-khshaeta|Hvare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dimitrov&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=D. Dimitrov |date=1987 |chapter=The Proto-Bulgarians east of the Sea of Azov in the VIII-IX cc. |title=Prabylgarite po severnoto i zapadnoto Chernomorie |chapter-url=http://www.kroraina.com/p_bulgar/p_bulg7.htm |work=kroraina.com |place=Varna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dimitrov cited the work by V.A. Kuznetsov, who considered the resemblance between the layout of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] temples of fire and the Kuban Bulgar centre, Humarin citadel, situated 11&amp;nbsp;km to the north of the town [[Karachayevsk]], where the pottery belonged to the [[Saltovo-Mayaki]] culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dimitrov&quot;/&gt; Kuznecov also found a connection in the plan of the Danube Bulgars sanctuaries at [[Pliska]], [[Veliki Preslav]], and [[Madara (village)|Madara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dimitrov&quot;/&gt; The architectural similarities include two squares of [[ashlar]]s inserted one into another, oriented towards the summer sunrise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dimitrov&quot;/&gt; One of these sites was transformed into a Christian church, which is taken as evidence that they served a religious function.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dimitrov&quot;/&gt;

The view of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] influence, which [[Franz Altheim]] also argued, is considered debatable, showing the cultural impact of the Iranian world on communities in the Pontic–Caspian steppe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim&quot;/&gt; Many scholars believe that the square shape, with the North-South and East-West axis of the Bulgar sacral monuments is very similar to those of Turkic khagans in Mongolia.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=160}} However, that the Bulgar residence in Pliska and [[Palace of Omurtag]] were inspired by the Byzantine architecture is considered indisputable.{{sfn|Fiedler|2008|p=196}}

[[Christianity]] had already begun to penetrate, probably via their Slavic subjects,{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=250}} when it  was adopted in the First Bulgarian Empire by [[Knyaz]] [[Boris I]] in 865 as a state religion.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=252}} There was interest in [[Islam]] as well, seen in the book ''Answers to the Questions of the King of the Burgar addressed to him about Islam and Unity'' by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] (813–833) for the Pontic/Bosporan Bulgars,{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=250}} while it was officially adopted in Volga Bulgaria as a state religion in 922.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gerald |last=Mako |date=2011 |title=The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered |journal=Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi |issue=18 |pages=199–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin and [[Bulgar language|language of the Bulgars]] has been the subject of debate since around the start of the 20th century.

According to P. Golden this association is apparent from the fragments of texts and isolated words and phrases preserved in inscriptions.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=250}}{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=66}} In addition to language, their culture and state structure retain many Central Asian features.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=250}} Military and hierarchical terms such as ''khan/qan'', ''kanasubigi'', ''qapağan'', ''tarkan'', ''bagatur'' and ''boila'' appear to be of Turkic origin.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=250}}{{sfn|Sedlar|2011|p=16}} The [[Bulgar calendar]] within the ''[[Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans]]'' had a twelve-year animal cycle, similar to the one adopted by Turkic and Mongolian peoples from the [[Chinese calendar|Chinese]], with animal names and numbers deciphered as Turkic.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=250}} [[Tengri]] (in Bulgar ''Tangra/Tengre'') was their supreme god.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=250}}

Bulgar inscriptions were written mostly in [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] or [[Cyrillic]] characters, most commonly in Greek or Graeco-Bulgar,{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=245}} sometimes with Slavic terms,{{sfn|Sedlar|2011|p=425}} thus allowing scholars to identify some of the Bulgar [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]].{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=245}} Several Bulgar inscriptions were found in Northeastern Bulgaria and parts of Romania, written in runes  similar to the [[Old Turkic alphabet]];{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=45}} they apparently have a sacral meaning.{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=45}} Altheim argued that the runes were brought into Europe from Central Asia by the Huns, and were an adapted version of the old [[Sogdian alphabet]] in the [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]]/Oghur Turkic language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim&quot;/&gt; The custom of stone engravings are considered to have Sasanian, Turkic and Roman parallels.{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=45}}{{sfn|Sedlar|2011|p=425}} The [[Madara Rider]] resembles work of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rock [[relief]] tradition, but its actual masonry tradition and cultural source is unknown.{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=45, 83}}

The Danubian Bulgars were unable to alter the predominantly Slavic character of Bulgaria,{{sfn|Sedlar|2011|p=424}} seen in the toponymy and names of the capitals Pliska and Preslav.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashev&quot;/&gt; They preserved their own native language and customs for about 200 years, but a bilingual period was recorded since the 9th century.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=69}}{{sfn|Sedlar|2011|p=424}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Henning&quot;/&gt; Golden argued that Bulgar Turkic almost disappeared with the transition to Christianity and [[Slavicisation]] in the middle of the 9th century.{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=268}} When the ruling class abandoned its native language and adopted Slavic, according to Jean W. Sedlar, it was so complete that no trace of Turkic speech patterns remained in Old Slavic texts.{{sfn|Sedlar|2011|p=424}} The Bulgarian Christian Church used Slavic dialect from Macedonia.{{sfn|Waldman, Mason|2006|p=108}}

Among Bulgarian academics, notably Petar Dobrev,{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=66}} a hypothesis linking the Bulgar language to the [[Iranian languages]] ([[Pamir languages|Pamir]]{{sfn|Karachanak, ''et al.''|2013}}) has been popular since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Добрев, Петър, 1995. &quot;Езикът на Аспаруховите и Куберовите българи&quot; 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stamatov |first=Atanas |date=1997 |title=TEMPORA INCOGNITA НА РАННАТА БЪЛГАРСКА ИСТОРИЯ |chapter=ИЗВОРИ И ИНТЕРПРЕТАЦИИ - І–ІІ ЧАСТ |chapter-url=http://www.protobulgarians.com/kniga_Atstamatov.htm |publisher=MGU Sv.

Due to the lack of definitive evidence, modern scholarship uses an [[Ethnogenesis#Ethnogenesis in historical scholarship|ethnogenesis]] approach in explaining the Bulgars origin. More recent theories view the nomadic confederacies, such as the Bulgars, as the formation of several different cultural, political and linguistic entities that could dissolve as quickly as they formed, entailing a process of ethnogenesis.

According to Walter Pohl, the existential fate of the tribes and their confederations depended on their ability to adapt to an environment going through rapid changes, and to give this adaptation a credible meaning rooted in tradition and ritual. Slavs and Bulgars succeeded because their form of organization proved as stable and as flexible as necessary, while the Pannonian Avars failed in the end because their model could not respond to new conditions. Pohl wrote that members of society's lower strata did not feel themselves to be part of any large-scale ethnic group; the only distinct classes were within the armies and the ruling elite.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pohl&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Pohl |first=Walter |author-link=Walter Pohl |date=1998 |chapter=Conceptions of Ethnicity in Early Medieval Studies |title=Debating the Middle Ages: Issues and Readings |chapter-url=http://www.kroraina.com/bulgar/pohl_etnicity.html |editor1=Lester K. Little |editor2=Barbara H. Rosenwein |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |pages=13–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies consider ethnonyms closely related with warrior elites who ruled over a variety of heterogeneous groups.{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=55}} The groups adopted new ideology and name as political designation, while the elites claimed right to rule and royal descent through origin myths.{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=55}}

When the Turkic tribes began to enter into the Pontic–Caspian steppe in the Post-Hunnic era, or as early as the 2nd century AD,{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=392}} their confederations incorporated an array of ethnic groups of newly joined Turkic, Altaic-Turkic, Caucasian, Iranian, and Finno-Ugric peoples.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=392–398}} During their Western Eurasian migrations to the Balkans, they also came into contact with  Armenian, Semitic, Slavic, Thracian and Anatolian Greek among other populations.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=383}}

[[File:Sivashovka group.svg|thumb|350px|Map of the monuments of Sivashovka type]]
From the 6th to 8th centuries, distinctive Bulgar monuments of the Sivashovka type were built upon ruins of the late [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] culture of the 2nd to 4th centuries AD,&lt;ref name=&quot;Graves&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=D.

Although the older Iranian tribes were enveloped by the widespread Turkic migration into the Pontic–Caspian steppe, the following centuries saw a complete disappearance of both the Iranian and Turkic languages, indicating dominance of the Slavic language among the common people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashev&quot;/&gt;

=== Anthropology and genetics ===
Genetic and anthropological researches have shown that the tribes of the Eurasian steppes were not always ethnically homogeneous, and were often [[Ethnogenesis#Ethnogenesis in historical scholarship|unions of multiple ethnicities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pohl&quot;/&gt; Skeletal remains from [[Kazakhstan]] (Central Asia), excavated from different sites dating between the 15th century BC to the 5th century AD, have been analyzed. The distribution of east and west Eurasian lineages through time in the region agrees with available archaeological information. Prior to the 13th - 7th century BC, all samples belong to [[European ethnic groups|European lineages]], while later, an arrival of [[East Asian]] sequences that coexisted with the previous genetic substratum was detected. Hundreds of excavated mummies in the [[Tarim Basin]] (West China) have Caucasoid features, revealing the presence of an ancient Caucasoid substratum in East Asia. These findings are associated with the ancient [[Tocharians]] and [[Tocharian languages]].{{sfn|Lalueza-Fox, ''et al.''|2004}}

According to P. Golden, the Central Asian Turkic peoples have multiple points of origin and are a mixture of steppes ethnic groups.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=379–382}} [[Eric Hobsbawm]] considered the languages to be &quot;almost always semi-artificial constructs&quot;.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=381}} Political processes, rather than linguistic, tribal or ethnic elements, created new communities.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=379–382}} Golden noted that the Turkic tribes in the Western Eurasia since the 1st millennium BC had contacts with [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. Those tribes were considered by Golden to be the ancestors of the Oğuric Turks.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=124–127}}

Recent blood and DNA studies of present-day populations in Central Asia confirm the extreme genetic heterogeneity.{{sfn|Lalueza-Fox, ''et al.''|2004}} The latest DNA studies on Turkic people in Central Asia and Eastern Europe also confirm genetic heterogeneity, indicating that the Turkic tribal confederations included various [[haplogroup]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cenghiz&quot;/&gt;

A comparative genetic study shows the Bulgarians primarily represented by the Western Eurasian [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y haplogroups]], with 40% belonging to haplogroups [[Haplogroup E-V68#E-V13|E-V13]] and [[Haplogroup I-M170#I-M423|I-M423]], and 20% to [[Haplogroup R-M17|R-M17]] (R-M198 and [[Haplogroup R-M17#R-M458|R-M458]]). Haplogroups common in the Middle East ([[Haplogroup J-M172|J-M172]], [[Haplogroup J-M267|J-M267]], and [[Haplogroup G-M201|G-M201]]) and in South Western Asia ([[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)#R1b1a2 (R-M269)|R-L23*]]) occur at frequencies of 19% and 5%, respectively. Haplogroups [[Haplogroup C-M130|C]], [[Haplogroup N-M231|N]] and [[Q-M242|Q]] together occur at the negligible frequency of only 1.5% among Bulgarians.{{sfn|Karachanak, ''et al.''|2013}}

A 2015 Bulgarian study found that Bulgars were &quot;genetically distant from Northern and Western Europeans and populations from the Near East and Caucasus. On the greatest distance from Proto-Bulgarians are Volga-Ural and Arabic populations.&quot; The study further mentions that &quot;...proto-Bulgarians are genetically similar to modern Bulgarians and to certain South-Eastern European as well as Italian populations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&amp;context=humbiol_preprints&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=September 2020}}

The DNA studies of the [[Chuvash people]], who speak a Turkic language ([[Chuvash language|Chuvash]]), show that they are genetically related to Caucasians, Mediterraneans, and Middle Easterners, partially Central or Northern Europeans (Finno-Ugric), but with little Central Asian-Altaic gene flow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnaiz&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arnaiz-Villena |date=June 2003 |title=HLA Genes in the Chuvashian Population from European Russia: Admixture of Central European and Mediterranean Populations |journal=[[Human Biology (journal)|Human Biology]] |volume=75 |issue=3 |issn=1534-6617 |pages=375–392|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1353/hub.2003.0040 |pmid=14527201|url=https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/1808/13584/1/Arnaiz-Villena_et_al_2003.pdf |hdl=1808/13584 |s2cid=9416136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA studies of the [[Tatars]], [[Bashkirs]] and Russians in [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] show European and Finno-Ugric impact on the Tatars; Caucasoid and East Asian impact were reported for the Bashkirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suslova&quot;/&gt; Some aspects of genetic relationships were found between Tatars and Chuvashes, as well Bulgarians, which could support the view that the Tatars may be descendants of ancient Bulgars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suslova&quot;/&gt; It is currently unknown with which haplogroup the Bulgars should be associated; some scholars consider the possibility that only a cultural and low genetic influence was brought into the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnaiz&quot;/&gt;

The paleoanthropological material from all sites in Volga region, Ukraine and Moldova attributed to the Bulgars testify complex ethno-cultural processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerasimova&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gerasimova M.M. |author2=Rud' N.M. |author3=Yablonsky L.T. |date=1987 |title=Antropologiya antichnovo i srednevekovo naseleniya Vostochno i Yevropy |trans-title=Anthropology of the Ancient and Middle Age Populations of Eastern Europe |url=http://сувары.рф/ru/content/antropologiya-antichnogo-i-srednevekovogo-naseleniya-vostochnoy-evropy |publisher=Наука |place=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material shows the assimilation between the local population and the migrating newcomers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graves&quot;/&gt; In all sites can be traced the anthropological type found in the Zlivka necropolis near the village of Ilichevki, the district of [[Donetsk]], of brachiocranic [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] with small [[Mongoloid|East Asian]] admixtures but with Bulgar males being more Mongoloid than females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iriston.com/nogbon/print.php?newsid=368|title=ЯВЛЕНИЕ ИССКУСТВЕННОЙ ДЕФОРМАЦИИ ЧЕРЕПА У ПРОТОБОЛГАР.

The pre-Christian burial customs in Bulgaria indicate diverse social, i.e. nomadic and sedentary, and cultural influences.{{sfn|Sophoulis|2011|p=68–69}} In some necropolises specific to the Danube Bulgars, artificial deformation was found in 80% of the skulls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graves&quot;/&gt; The Bulgars had a special type of shamanic &quot;medicine-men&quot; who performed [[Trepanning|trepanations]] of the skull, usually near the [[sagittal suture]]. This practice had a medical application, as well as a symbolic purpose; in two cases the patient had brain problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=D. Dimitrov |date=1987 |chapter=The Proto-Bulgarians north of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov in the VIII-IX cc. |title=Prabylgarite po severnoto i zapadnoto Chernomorie |chapter-url=http://www.kroraina.com/p_bulgar/p_bulg8.html |work=kroraina.com |place=Varna}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maenchen-Helfen and Rashev, the artificial deformation of skulls, and other types of burial artifacts in Bulgars graves, are similar to those of the Sarmatians, and Sarmatized Turks or Turkicized Sarmatians of the post-Hunnic graves in the Ukrainian steppe.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=443}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashev&quot;/&gt;

== Legacy ==
In modern [[ethnic nationalism]] there is some &quot;rivalry for the Bulgar legacy&quot; (see [[Bulgarism]]). The [[Volga Tatars]] and [[Chuvash people]], are said to be descended from the Volga Bulgars,{{sfn|Shnirelʹman|1996|p=22–35}} and there may have been ethnogenic influences on the [[Bashkirs]], [[Karachays]] and [[Balkars]] also.{{sfn|Olson, Pappas, Pappas|1994|p=79–81, 84–87, 114–115}}

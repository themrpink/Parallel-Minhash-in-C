Our father
Thou who art in the heavens.
May hallowed be thy name
may come thy empire
may become thy will
as in heaven, also on Earth.
Our [[supersubstantial]] bread
give us this day
and release us of our debts
as we also release
our debtors,
and do not lead us to temptation
but free us from the evil.
As thine is the empire
and the power and the glory unto the ages of ages.
Amen.

==Authors==
The history of Old Church Slavonic writing includes a northern tradition begun by the mission to [[Great Moravia]], including a short mission in the [[Balaton principality]], and a Bulgarian tradition begun by some of the missionaries who relocated to [[Bulgaria]] after the expulsion from Great Moravia.

Old Church Slavonic's first writings, translations of Christian liturgical and Biblical texts, were produced by Byzantine missionaries [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril]] and [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki|Saint Methodius]], mostly during their mission to [[Great Moravia]].

The most important authors in Old Church Slavonic after the death of Methodius and the dissolution of the Great Moravian academy were [[Clement of Ohrid]] (active also in Great Moravia), [[Constantine of Preslav]], [[Chernorizetz Hrabar]] and [[John Exarch]], all of whom worked in medieval [[Bulgaria]] at the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 10th century. The [[Second Book of Enoch]] was only preserved in Old Church Slavonic, although the original most certainly had been [[Greek language|Greek]] or even [[Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic]].

==Nomenclature==
The name of the language in Old Church Slavonic texts was simply ''Slavic'' (словѣ́ньскъ ѩꙁꙑ́къ, ''slověnĭskŭ językŭ''),&lt;ref name=nandris&gt;{{Harvnb|Nandris|1959|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the word for ''Slavs'' (словѣ́нє, ''slověne''), the self-designation of the compilers of the texts. This name is preserved in the modern names of the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] languages. The language is sometimes called ''Old Slavic'', which may be confused with the distinct [[Proto-Slavic language]]. Different strains of [[Nationalism|nationalists]] have tried to 'claim' Old Church Slavonic; thus OCS has also been variously called &quot;Old Bulgarian&quot;, , &quot;Old Croatian&quot;, &quot;Old Macedonian&quot;, or &quot;Old Serbian&quot;, or even &quot;Old Slovak&quot;, &quot;Old Slovenian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kamusella|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JzkWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 34]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly accepted terms in modern English-language [[Slavistics|Slavic studies]] are ''Old Church Slavonic'' and ''Old Church Slavic''.

The term ''Old Bulgarian''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerslo.net/files/File/simpozij/sim20/ziffer.pdf Ziffer, Giorgio – On the Historicity of Old Church Slavonic UDK 811.163.1(091)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627094728/http://www.centerslo.net/files/File/simpozij/sim20/ziffer.pdf |date=2008-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|Altbulgarisch}}) is the only designation used by [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian-language]] writers. It was used in numerous 19th-century sources, e.g. by [[August Schleicher]], [[Martin Hattala]], [[Leopold Geitler]] and [[August Leskien]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Leskien, Handbuch der altbulgarischen (altkirchenslavischen) Sprache, 6. Aufl., Heidelberg 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Leskien, Grammatik der altbulgarischen (altkirchenslavischen) Sprache, 2.-3. Aufl., Heidelberg 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; who noted similarities between the first literary Slavic works and the modern Bulgarian language. For similar reasons, [[Russia]]n linguist [[Aleksandr Vostokov]] used the term ''Slav-Bulgarian''. The term is still used by some writers but nowadays normally avoided in favor of ''Old Church Slavonic''.

The term ''Old Macedonian''&lt;ref&gt;J P Mallory, D Q Adams. Encyclopaedia of Indo-European Culture. Pg 301 &quot;Old Church Slavonic, the liturgical language of the Eastern Orthodox Church, is based on the Thessalonican dialect of Old Macedonian, one of the South Slavic languages.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Asher, J. M. Y. Simpson. ''The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'', Introduction &quot;Macedonian is descended from the dialects of Slavic speakers who settled in the Balkan peninsula during the 6th and 7th centuries CE. The oldest attested Slavic language, Old Church Slavonic, was based on dialects spoken around Salonica, in what is today Greek Macedonia. As it came to be defined in the 19th century, geographic Macedonia is the region bounded by Mount Olympus, the Pindus range, Mount Shar and Osogovo, the western Rhodopes, the lower course of the river Mesta (Greek Nestos), and the Aegean Sea. Many languages are spoken in the region but it is the Slavic dialects to which the glossonym Macedonian is applied.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Asher, J. M. Y. Simpson. ''The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'', History, &quot;Modern Macedonian literary activity began in the early 19th century among intellectuals attempt to write their Slavic vernacular instead of Church Slavonic. Two centers of Balkan Slavic literary arose, one in what is now northeastern Bulgaria, the other in what is now southwestern Macedonia. In the early 19th century, all these intellectuals called their language Bulgarian, but a struggled emerged between those who favored northeastern Bulgarian dialects and those who favored western Macedonian dialects as the basis for what would become the standard language. Northeastern Bulgarian became the basis of standard Bulgarian, and Macedonian intellectuals began to work for a separate Macedonian literary language. &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tschizewskij, Dmitrij (2000) [1971]. ''Comparative History of Slavic Literatures''. Nashville, TN: [[Vanderbilt University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-826-51371-7}}. &quot;The brothers knew the Old Bulgarian or Old Macedonian dialect spoken around Thessalonica.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W. Fortson. ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', pg. 431 &quot;Macedonian was not distinguished from Bulgarian for most of its history. Constantine and Methodius came from Macedonian Thessaloniki; their old Bulgarian is therefore at the same time 'Old Macedonian'. No Macedonian literature dates from earlier than the nineteenth century, when a nationalist movement came to the fore and a literacy language was established, first written with Greek letters, then in Cyrillic&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W. Fortson. ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', pg. 427 &quot;The Old Church Slavonic of Bulgaria, regarded as something of a standard, is often called Old Bulgarian (or Old Macedonian)&quot;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Cooper. ''Slavic Scriptures: The Formation of the Church Slavonic Version of the Holy Bible'', pg. 86 &quot;We do not know what portions of the Bible in Church Slavonic, let alone a full one, were available in Macedonia by Clement's death. And although we might wish to make Clement and Naum patron saints of such as glagolitic-script, Macedonian-recension Church Slavonic Bible, their precise contributions to it we will have to take largely on faith.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; is occasionally used by Western scholars in a regional context.

__NOTOC__
Year '''299''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCXCIX]]''') was a [[common year starting on Sunday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Valerius and Valerius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1052 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 299 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

[[File:Flag of the Nordic Council.svg|thumb|Flag before 2016]]
The '''Nordic Council''' is the official body for formal inter-parliamentary Nordic cooperation among the [[Nordic countries]]. Formed in 1952, it has 87 representatives from [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] as well as from the autonomous areas of the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], and the [[Åland Islands]]. The representatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or areas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary sessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year with a specific theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council|title=The Nordic Council|website=Nordic cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's official languages are [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], though it uses only Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish as its [[working language]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;languages&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/information/nordic-languages|title=The Nordic languages|website=Nordic cooperation|access-date=4 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three comprise the first language of around 80% of the region's population and are learned as a second or foreign language by the remaining 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/en/fakta-om-norden-1/language|title=Language|date=6 August 2008|access-date=1 June 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705052009/http://www.norden.org/en/fakta-om-norden-1/language|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]], an [[intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental]] forum, was established to complement the Council. The Council and the Council of Ministers are involved in various forms of cooperation with neighbouring areas, amongst them being the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague|title=Ratas meets with Benelux, Nordic, Baltic leaders in the Hague|last=ERR|date=22 June 2017|work=ERR|access-date=1 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Russia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Tobias Etzold 2015&quot;&gt;Tobias Etzold, &quot;Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting,&quot; in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Offices outside the Nordic Region&quot;&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817022915/http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region |date=17 August 2018 }}. Nordic Council of Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During World War II, [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] were occupied by [[Germany]]; [[Finland]] was [[Winter War|under assault]] by the [[Soviet Union]]; while [[Sweden]], though neutral, still felt the war's effects. Following the war, the [[Nordic countries]] pursued the idea of a [[Scandinavian defence union]] to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland, due to its [[Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine|Paasikivi-Kekkonen policy of neutrality]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|FCMA treaty]] with the USSR, could not participate.

It was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with [[NATO]], which some were planning at the time. The [[United States]], keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.lu/plan_scandinavian_defence_union-2-6834 The plan for a Scandinavian Defence Union], [[European Navigator]]. Étienne Deschamps. Translated by the CVCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led [[Danish Prime Minister]] [[Hans Hedtoft]] to propose, in 1951, a consultative inter-parliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;H1&quot;&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/before-1952 Before 1952] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330201905/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/before-1952 |date=30 March 2014 }}, Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-Soviet relations thawed following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Finland joined the council in 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;H2&quot;&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/1953-1971 1953–1971 Finland joins in and the first Nordic rights are formulated.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330201909/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/1953-1971 |date=30 March 2014 }}, Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building upon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the [[Nordic Passport Union]] was created. These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There were also plans for a [[single market]] but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway applied to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).&lt;ref name=&quot;H2&quot;/&gt;

This move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The [[Helsinki Treaty]] outlined the workings of the Council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and Nordic House in [[Reykjavík]] were created. Danish Prime Minister [[Hilmar Baunsgaard]] proposed full economic cooperation (&quot;[[Nordek]]&quot;) in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway).&lt;ref name=&quot;H2&quot;/&gt; Nordek was then abandoned.

As a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic cooperation.&lt;ref name=&quot;HM1&quot;&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 The period up to 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111240/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 representatives of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Åland Islands|Åland]] were allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish delegations.&lt;ref name=&quot;H2&quot;/&gt; Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics.&lt;ref name=&quot;HM2&quot;&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 1972–1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111152/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, although it did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on, although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more active role in [[Arctic cooperation and politics|circumpolar]] affairs.

In the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the [[Nordic Industrial Fund]], Nordtest and the [[Nordic Investment Bank]]. The Council's remit was also expanded to include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], a joint energy network was established. The Nordic Science Policy Council was set up in 1983&lt;ref name=&quot;HM2&quot;/&gt; and, in 1984, representatives from Greenland were allowed to join the Danish delegation.&lt;ref name=&quot;H2&quot;/&gt;

During the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, there was a booming international trade in plumes for extravagant women's hats and other headgear.  [[Frank Chapman (ornithologist)|Frank Chapman]] noted in 1886 that feathers of as many as 40 species of birds were used in about three-fourths of the 700 ladies' hats that he observed in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Doughty, Robin W. ''Feather Fashions and Bird Preservation, A Study in Nature Protection''. University of California Press. Page 197.&lt;/ref&gt; This trade caused severe losses to bird populations (for example, [[egret]]s and [[whooping crane]]s). Conservationists led a major campaign against the use of feathers in hats. This contributed to passage of the [[Lacey Act]] in 1900, and to changes in fashion. The ornamental feather market then largely collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1= Ehrlich| first1= Paul R.| last2= Dobkin| first2= David S.| last3= Wheye| first3= Darryl| year= 1988| url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Plume_Trade.html| title= Plume Trade| publisher= Stanford University| url-status= live| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080930070559/http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Plume_Trade.html| archive-date= 30 September 2008| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/feather/ftfa.htm Feather trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623044023/http://americanhistory.si.edu/feather/ftfa.htm |date=23 June 2008 }}, Smithsonian Institution&lt;/ref&gt;

These feathers are dyed and manipulated to enhance their appearance, as poultry feathers are naturally often dull in appearance compared to the feathers of wild birds.

Feather products manufacturing in Europe has declined in the last 60 years, mainly due to competition from Asia.
Feathers have adorned hats at many prestigious events such as weddings and Ladies Day at racecourses (Royal Ascot).

Feathers and scales are made up of two distinct forms of [[keratin]], and it was long thought that each type of keratin was exclusive to each skin structure (feathers and scales). However, a study published in 2006 confirmed the presence of feather keratin in the early stages of development of [[American alligator]] scales. This type of keratin, previously thought to be specific to feathers, is suppressed during embryological development of the alligator and so is not present in the scales of mature alligators. The presence of this [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] keratin in both birds and [[crocodilian]]s indicates that it was inherited from a common ancestor. This may suggest that crocodilian scales, bird and dinosaur feathers, and pterosaur [[pycnofibre]]s are all developmental expressions of the same primitive archosaur skin structures; suggesting that feathers and pycnofibers could be homologous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17784647|year=2006|last1=Alibardi|first1=L|last2=Knapp|first2=LW|last3=Sawyer|first3=RH|title=Beta-keratin localization in developing alligator scales and feathers in relation to the development and evolution of feathers|volume=38|issue=2–3|pages=175–92|journal=Journal of Submicroscopic Cytology and Pathology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Foth (2011) showed that some of these purported stages (stages 2 and 5 in particular) are likely simply artifacts of preservation caused by the way fossil feathers are crushed and the feather remains or imprints are preserved. Foth re-interpreted stage 2 feathers as crushed or misidentified feathers of at least stage 3, and stage 5 feathers as crushed stage 6 feathers.&lt;ref name=&quot;foth2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foth | first1 = C | year = 2011 | title = On the identification of feather structures in stem-line representatives of birds: evidence from fossils and actuopalaeontology | journal = Paläontologische Zeitschrift | volume =  86| pages =  91–102| doi = 10.1007/s12542-011-0111-3 | s2cid = 86362907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following simplified diagram of dinosaur relationships follows these results, and shows the likely distribution of plumaceous (downy) and pennaceous (vaned) feathers among dinosaurs and prehistoric birds. The diagram follows one presented by Xu and Guo (2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;xu&amp;guo2009&quot;/&gt; modified with the findings of Foth (2011).&lt;ref name=&quot;foth2011&quot;/&gt; The numbers accompanying each name refer to the presence of specific feather stages. Note that 's' indicates the known presence of scales on the body.

=== In pterosaurs ===
[[Pterosaur]]s were long known to have filamentous fur-like structures covering their body known as [[pycnofibres]], which were generally considered distinct from the &quot;true feathers&quot; of birds and their dinosaur kin. However, a 2018 study of two small, well-preserved pterosaur fossils from the [[Jurassic]] of [[Inner Mongolia]], [[China]] indicated that pterosaurs were covered in an array of differently-structured pycnofibres (rather than just filamentous ones), with several of these structures displaying diagnostic features of feathers, such as non-veined grouped filaments and bilaterally branched filaments, both of which were originally thought to be exclusive to birds and other maniraptoran dinosaurs. Given these findings, it is possible that feathers have deep evolutionary origins in ancestral [[archosaur]]s, though there is also a possibility that these structures independently evolved to resemble bird feathers via [[convergent evolution]]. Mike Benton, the study's senior author, lent credence to the former theory, stating &quot;We couldn’t find any anatomical evidence that the four pycnofiber types are in any way different from the feathers of birds and dinosaurs. Therefore, because they are the same, they must share an evolutionary origin, and that was about 250 million years ago, long before the origin of birds.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Zixiao|last2=Jiang|first2=Baoyu|last3=McNamara|first3=Maria E.|last4=Kearns|first4=Stuart L.|last5=Pittman|first5=Michael|last6=Kaye|first6=Thomas G.|last7=Orr|first7=Patrick J.|last8=Xu|first8=Xing|last9=Benton|first9=Michael J.|date=January 2019|title=Pterosaur integumentary structures with complex feather-like branching|journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24–30|doi=10.1038/s41559-018-0728-7|pmid=30568282|issn=2397-334X|hdl=1983/1f7893a1-924d-4cb3-a4bf-c4b1592356e9|s2cid=56480710|url=https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/files/184677374/Main_Text_revised_mjb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sci-news.com/paleontology/pterosaur-feathers-06733.html|title=Pterosaurs Had Four Types of Feathers, New Study Shows {{!}} Paleontology {{!}} Sci-News.com|website=Breaking Science News {{!}} Sci-News.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20181217&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Feathers and Fur Fly Over Pterosaur Fossil Finding - An analysis of two fossils would push back the origins of feathers by about 70 million years, but more specimens may be needed for confirmation. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/science/pterosaur-feathers-fur.html |date=17 December 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=19 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46572782|title=Fur flies over new pterosaur fossils|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=2018-12-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-12-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madagascar]] is a large island in the [[Indian Ocean]] off the eastern coast of southern [[Africa]], east of [[Mozambique]]. It has a total area of {{convert|587040|km2}} with {{convert|581540|km2}} of land and {{convert|5500|km2}} of water. Madagascar is the [[List of islands by area|fourth largest island]] and the 2nd largest [[List of island countries|island country]] in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;world-atlas&quot;/&gt; The highest point is [[Maromokotro]], in the [[Tsaratanana]] Massif region in the north of the island, at {{convert|2876|m}}. The capital [[Antananarivo]] is in the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]] near the centre of the island. It has the 25th largest [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of {{convert|1,225,259|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. Madagascar is 400 kilometres (250 miles) east of mainland Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Madagascar |url=http://www.air-mad.com/about_location.html |work=Cortez USA Tours &amp; Travel |date=2012 |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical regions==
Madagascar can be divided into five general geographical regions: the east coast, the Tsaratanana Massif, the Central Highlands, the west coast, and the southwest. The highest elevations parallel the east coast.&lt;ref name=LC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/madagascar/7.htm|title=Madagascar-GEOGRAPHY|website=countrystudies.us|publisher=U. S.

[[File:Madagascar topo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Land coverage (left) and topographical (right) maps of Madagascar]]

===East coast===
The east coast consists of a narrow band of lowlands about one kilometer wide, formed from the [[sedimentation]] of [[Alluvium|alluvial soils]], and an intermediate zone composed of steep bluffs alternating with ravines bordering an escarpment of about {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} in elevation, which gives access to the Central Highlands. The coastal region extends roughly from north of Baie d'Antongil, the most prominent feature on the [[Masoala National Park|Masoala]] Peninsula, to the far north of the island. The coastline is straight, with the exception of a bay, offering less in the way of natural harbors than the west coast.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt; 

The [[Canal des Pangalanes]], an {{convert|800|km|mi|0|sing=on}}-long lagoon formed naturally by the washing of sand up on the island by the Indian Ocean currents and by the silting of rivers, is a feature of the coast; it has been used both as a means of transportation up and down the coast and as a fishing area. The beach slopes steeply into deep water. The east coast is considered dangerous for swimmers and sailors because of the large number of sharks that frequent the shoreline.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

===Tsaratanana Massif===

The Tsaratanana Massif region at the north end of the island contains, at {{convert|2880|m|ft|0}}, the highest point on the island. Further north is the Montagne d'Ambre (Ambohitra), which is of volcanic origin. The coastline is deeply indented; two prominent features are the natural harbor at [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suárez), just south of the Cap d'Ambre (Tanjon' i Bobaomby), and the large island of [[Nosy Be]] to the west. The mountainous topography of the Tsaratanana Massif limits the potential of the port at Antsiranana by impeding the flow of traffic from other parts of the island.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

===Central Highlands===
[[File:Landscape Madagascar 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Village in the central highlands]]
{{Main|Central Highlands (Madagascar)}}
The Central Highlands, which range from {{convert|800|to|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in altitude, contain a wide variety of topographies: rounded and eroded hills, massive granite outcrops, extinct volcanoes, eroded peneplains, and alluvial plains and marshes, which have been converted into irrigated rice fields. The Central Highlands extend from the Tsaratanana Massif in the north to the Ivakoany Massif in the south. They are defined rather clearly by the escarpments along the east coast, and they slope gently to the west coast. The Central Highlands include the Anjafy High Plateaux; the volcanic formations of Itasy (Lake Itasy is in a volcanic crater) and the Ankaratra Massif, reaching a height of {{convert|2643|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The Isalo Roiniforme Massif lies between the central highlands and the west coast.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

Antananarivo, the national capital, is located in the northern portion of the Central Highlands at {{convert|1276|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. A prominent feature of the Central Highlands is a [[rift valley]] running north to south, located east of Antananarivo and including [[Lake Alaotra|Lac Alaotra]], the largest body of water on the island. The lake is located {{convert|761|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level and is bordered by two cliffs, rising {{convert|701|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to the west and {{convert|488|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to the east, which form the walls of a valley. This region has experienced geological [[subsidence]], and earth tremors are frequent.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

===West coast===

The west coast, composed of sedimentary formations, is more indented than the east coast, thus offering a number of harbors sheltered from cyclones, such as the harbor at [[Mahajanga]]. Deep bays and well-protected harbors have attracted explorers, traders, and [[pirates]] from [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]] since ancient times; thus, the area has served as an important bridge between Madagascar and the outside world. Silting up of harbors on this coast, caused by sediment from the high levels of erosion suffered inland in Madagascar, is a major problem. The broad alluvial plains found on the coast between Mahajanga and [[Toliara]], which are believed to have great agricultural potential, are thinly inhabited, in many places covered with swamps of [[Madagascar mangroves]], and remain largely unexplored, although they are the subject of mineral and [[hydrocarbon exploration]] activity. The giant oil fields of [[Tsimiroro]] (heavy oil) and [[Bemolanga]] (ultra heavy oil) lie towards the west of the island.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

===Southwest===

The southwest is bordered on the east by the Ivakoany Massif and on the north by the Isala Roiniforme Massif. It includes two regions along the south coast, the Mahafaly Plateau and the desert region occupied by the [[Antandroy]] people.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

==Rivers and lakes==
The [[Mananara River|Mananara]] and [[Mangoro River|Mangoro]] rivers flow from the Central Highlands to the east coast, as does the [[Maningory River|Maningory]], which flows from [[Lake Alaotra]]. Other rivers flowing east into the [[Indian Ocean]] include the [[Bemarivo River|Bemarivo]], the [[Ivondro River|Ivondro]], and the [[Mananjary River|Mananjary]]. These rivers tend to be short because the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] is located close to the east coast. Owing to the steep elevations, they flow rapidly, often over spectacular waterfalls.

The rivers flowing to the west coast discharge into the [[Mozambique Channel]] and tend to be lengthier and have a lesser gradient. The major rivers on the west coast are the Sambirano, the [[Mahajamba River|Mahajamba]], the [[Betsiboka River|Betsiboka]] (part of [[Mahajanga]] is located at the mouth), the [[Mania River|Mania]], the North and South Mahavavy, the [[Mangoky River|Mangoky]], and the [[Onilahy River|Onilahy]]. The [[Ikopa River|Ikopa]], which flows past Antananarivo, is a tributary of the Betsiboka. The Onilahy, located in the driest part of the island, occasionally dries up during droughts.

Important lakes, aside from Alaotra, include [[Lake Kinkony]] in the northwest, [[Lake Itasy]] in the center and [[Lake Ihotry]] in the southwest.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Geographic features==
===Somali Plate===
Madagascar originated as part of the [[Gondwana]] supercontinent. Its west coast was formed when Africa broke off from Gondwana around 165 million years ago. Madagascar eventually broke off from [[Indian Plate|India]] about 88 million years ago. It is geologically located within the [[Somali plate]].

===Soils===

Madagascar has been called the &quot;Great Red Island&quot; because of the prominence of red [[Laterite|lateritic]] soils. The red soils predominate the Central Highlands, although there are much richer soils in the regions of former volcanic activity, [[Itasy Region|Itasy]] and [[Ankaratra]], and [[Tsaratanana]] to the north. A narrow band of [[alluvial]] soils is found all along the east coast and at the mouths of the major rivers on the west coast; clay, sand, and [[limestone]] mixtures are found in the west; and shallow or skeletal laterite and limestone are located in the south. [[Deforestation]] and grazing cause aggressive [[erosion]] in many locations.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

==Climate==

The climate is [[tropical]] along the coast, [[temperate]] inland, and [[arid]] in the south. The weather is dominated by the southeastern [[trade wind]]s that originate in the Indian Ocean [[anticyclone]], a center of high atmospheric pressure that seasonally changes its position over the ocean. Madagascar has two seasons: a warm, wet season from November to April; and a cooler, dry season from May to October. There is, however, great variation in climate owing to elevation and position relative to dominant winds. Overall, surface water is most abundant along the east coast and in the far north (with the exception of the area around Cap d'Ambre, which has relatively little surface water). Amounts diminish to the west and south, and the driest regions are in the extreme south.

The east coast has a tropical rainforest climate; being most directly [[orographic precipitation|exposed to the trade winds]], it has the highest rainfall, averaging as high as {{convert|4000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} annually in some places. This region has a hot, humid climate in which [[Tropical disease|tropical fevers]] are endemic. Destructive cyclones occur during the rainy season, coming in principally from the direction of the [[Mascarene Islands]]. Because rain clouds discharge much of their moisture east of the highest elevations on the island, the Central Highlands are drier and, owing to the altitude, also cooler. Thunderstorms are common during the rainy season in the Central Highlands and the eastern coastal lowlands.

Antananarivo receives practically all of its average annual {{convert|1400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall between November and April. The dry season is sunny, although somewhat chilly, especially in the mornings. Although frosts are rare in Antananarivo, they are common at higher elevations. Hail is common in many of the higher areas of the island (including Antananarivo), but there is no snowfall except on the [[Ankaratra]] massif where above {{convert|2400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} it may occasionally fall and even remain for several days.

The west coast is drier than either the east coast or the Central Highlands because the trade winds [[foehn effect|lose their humidity]] by the time they reach this region. The southwest and the extreme south are semidesert; as little as {{convert|330|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain falls annually at [[Toliara]]. 

Madagascar occasionally experiences the impact of cyclones. During February 2–4, 1994, Madagascar was struck by [[Cyclone Geralda]]. The cyclone killed seventy people and destroyed enough property to leave approximately 500,000 homeless, including 30,000 in Antananarivo and 80,000 in [[Toamasina]]. The cyclone also significantly damaged the country's infrastructure, most notably coastal roads, railroads, and telecommunications, as well as agriculture. The damage was estimated at US$45 million.

During March 1-18, 2004, Madagascar was impacted by [[Cyclone Gafilo]], the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the South-West Indian Ocean.  The National Rescue Council in [[Antananarivo]] reported 237 dead, 181 missing, 879 injured, and 304,000 homeless (174,000 in [[Antalaha]] alone). More than 20,000 homes were destroyed, as well as 413 public buildings and 3,400 schools were damaged, including 1,400 schools completely destroyed. The Cyclone left an estimated damage of US$250 million.

The island of Madagascar has been described as an &quot;alternate world&quot; or a &quot;world apart&quot; because of the uniqueness and rarity of many of its plant and animal species. Their characteristics are believed to reflect the island's origins as a part of [[Gondwanaland]] and its many millions of years of isolation following the breakup of the landmass.

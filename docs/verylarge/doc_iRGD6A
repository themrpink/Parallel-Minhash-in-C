The goal of the national parks system is to set aside lands representing the country's 39 distinct natural regions described in the ''National Parks System Plan'', primarily to protect the ecological integrity of the land, and secondarily to allow the public to explore, learn about and enjoy Canada's natural spaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intro&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/introduction|title=National Parks of Canada – Introduction|website=Parks Canada|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 the ''Rocky Mountains Park Act'' was replaced by the ''Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act'' which created the world's first National Park Service, the Dominion Parks Branch, to administer national parks in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/travel/northamerica/article/990243--parks-canada-celebrates-a-century-of-discovery|title=Parks Canada celebrates a century of discovery|last=Irish|first=Paul|date=13 May 2011|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early national parks, including those established under the leadership of [[James Bernard Harkin|JB Harkin]] who was the first commissioner of the Dominion Parks Branch, were set aside to reserve lands principally for tourism and conservation but also had an exclusionary policy prohibiting [[First Nations]] peoples from using their traditional lands within the new parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Theodore |last1=Binnema |first2=Melanie |last2=Niemi |title='Let the line be drawn now': Wilderness, Conservation, and the Exclusion of Aboriginal People from Banff National Park in Canada|journal=Environmental History|year=2006|volume=11|issue=4|pages=724–50|doi=10.1093/envhis/11.4.724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] was the first to allow traditional indigenous activities to continue.

==National Marine Conservation Areas==
[[National Marine Conservation Area]]s (NMCAs) is a program established in 2002 with the goal of preserving marine ecosystems representing the 29 marine regions of Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;nmcaplan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/amnc-nmca/cnamnc-cnnmca/carte-map-txt |title=Completing the National Marine Conservation Areas System |website=Parks Canada |date=30 March 2017 |accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are designed for sustainable use, although they usually also contain areas designed to protect [[ecological integrity]]. National Marine Conservation Area Reserves are protected areas proposed to be added to the NMCA system pending settlement of indigenous land and water rights. In the interim, they are administered under park rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/amnc-nmca/plan|title=National Marine Conservation Area System|website=Parks Canada|date=20 July 2017|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2020}}, established NMCAs and NMCA Reserves protect {{cvt|14,846|sqkm}} of waters, wetlands, and coastlines, representing five of the 29 identified marine regions with studies underway for protected areas in three additional regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;nmcaplan&quot;/&gt;

Provincial parks are administered and funded by the provincial governments; however, some provincial parks are categorized as ''[[national park]]s'' (Category II) under the [[IUCN]]'s Protected Area Management Categories.

[[Gatineau Park]] in [[Quebec]] is another park under the jurisdiction of the federal government. However, it is managed by the [[National Capital Commission]], not Parks Canada, and is not considered part of the national parks system.

'''''Mutiny on the Bounty''''' is the title of the 1932 novel by [[Charles Nordhoff]] and [[James Norman Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Brotzel.[https://www.sfwa.org/2019/09/23/collaboration/ Collaboration].[[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]]. September 23, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny]] against Lieutenant [[William Bligh]], commanding officer of the [[HMS Bounty|''Bounty'']] in 1789. It has been made into several films and a musical. It was the first of what became ''The Bounty Trilogy'', which continues with ''[[Men Against the Sea]]'', and concludes with ''[[Pitcairn's Island (novel)|Pitcairn's Island]]''.

==Plot introduction==

He subsequently returns to Tahiti, and is eventually arrested and taken back to England to face a [[court-martial]].  He and several other members of the crew are eventually acquitted.

==Characters in ''Mutiny on the Bounty''==
*Roger Byam – main protagonist, loosely based on life of midshipman [[Peter Heywood]]; but with differences-in the book it is claimed that Byam's only living relative was his mother who died of shock after William Bligh had accused her son of being an active mutineer; in fact Heywood had several siblings; his mother survived his court-martial- although his sister Nessy Heywood did die a year after his aquital
*[[William Bligh]] – Lieutenant and commander of the ''Bounty''
*[[Fletcher Christian]] – eventual mutineer

==Film, TV and theatrical adaptations==
*''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'' (1933) (notable as the first film to introduce [[Errol Flynn]] to movie audiences, as Fletcher Christian)
*''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1935)
*''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1962)

'''Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino'''&lt;ref&gt;Variants also include ''Raffaello Santi'', ''Raffaello da Urbino'' or ''Rafael Sanzio da Urbino''.

Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his early death at 37, leaving a large body of work. Many of his works are found in the [[Vatican Palace]], where the frescoed [[Raphael Rooms]] were the central, and the largest, work of his career. The best known work is ''[[The School of Athens]]'' in the Vatican [[Stanza della Segnatura]]. After his early years in Rome, much of his work was executed by his workshop from his drawings, with considerable loss of quality. He was extremely influential in his lifetime, though outside Rome his work was mostly known from his collaborative [[printmaking]].

[[Image:Escola de atenas - vaticano.jpg|thumb|Raphael, ''[[The School of Athens]]'']]
After his death, the influence of his great rival Michelangelo was more widespread until the 18th and 19th centuries, when Raphael's more serene and harmonious qualities were again regarded as the highest models. His career falls naturally into three phases and three styles, first described by [[Giorgio Vasari]]: his early years in [[Umbria]], then a period of about four years (1504–1508) absorbing the artistic traditions of [[Florence]], followed by his last hectic and triumphant twelve years in Rome, working for two Popes and their close associates.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, pp. 208, 230 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was [[court painter]] to the ruler of the small but highly cultured city of Urbino. He died when Raphael was eleven, and Raphael seems to have played a role in managing the family workshop from this point. He trained in the workshop of Perugino, and was described as a fully trained &quot;master&quot; by 1500.  He worked in or for several cities in north Italy until in 1508 he moved to Rome at the invitation of the pope, to work on the Vatican Palace.  He was given a series of important commissions there and elsewhere in the city, and began to work as an architect. He was still at the height of his powers at his death in 1520.    

==Background==
[[File:Giovanni Santi - Christ supported by two angels.jpg|thumb|[[Giovanni Santi]], Raphael's father; ''Christ supported by two angels'', c.1490]]
Raphael was born in the small but artistically significant central Italian city of [[Urbino]] in the [[Marche]] region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Urbino: The Story of a Renaissance City|first= June |last=Osborne|page=39 on the population, as a &quot;few thousand&quot; at most; even today it is only 15,000 without the students of the University}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his father [[Giovanni Santi]] was court painter to the Duke. The reputation of the court had been established by [[Federico da Montefeltro]], a highly successful [[condottiere]] who had been created [[Duke of Urbino]] by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] – Urbino formed part of the [[Papal States]] – and who died the year before Raphael was born. The emphasis of Federico's court was more literary than artistic, but Giovanni Santi was a poet of sorts as well as a painter, and had written a rhymed chronicle of the life of Federico, and both wrote the texts and produced the decor for [[masque]]-like court entertainments. His poem to Federico shows him as keen to demonstrate awareness of the most advanced North Italian painters, and [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish artists]] as well. In the very small court of Urbino he was probably more integrated into the central circle of the ruling family than most court painters.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Federico was succeeded by his son [[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]], who married [[Elisabetta Gonzaga]], daughter of the ruler of [[Mantua]], the most brilliant of the smaller Italian courts for both music and the visual arts. Under them, the court continued as a centre for literary culture. Growing up in the circle of this small court gave Raphael the excellent manners and social skills stressed by [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]].&lt;ref&gt;Vasari:207 &amp; passim&lt;/ref&gt; Court life in Urbino at just after this period was to become set as the model of the virtues of the Italian humanist court through [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s depiction of it in his classic work ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'', published in 1528. Castiglione moved to Urbino in 1504, when Raphael was no longer based there but frequently visited, and they became good friends. Raphael became close to other regular visitors to the court: [[Bernardo Dovizi|Pietro Bibbiena]] and [[Pietro Bembo]], both later [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], were already becoming well known as writers, and would later be in Rome during Raphael's period there. Raphael mixed easily in the highest circles throughout his life, one of the factors that tended to give a misleading impression of effortlessness to his career. He did not receive a full [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic education]] however; it is unclear how easily he read Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:204&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and work==

Raphael's mother Màgia died in 1491 when he was eight, followed on August 1, 1494 by his father, who had already remarried. Raphael was thus orphaned at eleven; his formal guardian became his only paternal uncle Bartolomeo, a priest, who subsequently engaged in litigation with his stepmother. He probably continued to live with his stepmother when not staying as an apprentice with a master. He had already shown talent, according to Vasari, who says that Raphael had been &quot;a great help to his father&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, at the start of the ''Life''. Jones &amp; Penny:5&lt;/ref&gt; A [[self-portrait]] drawing from his teenage years shows his precocity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ashmolean Museum]] {{cite web |url=http://z.about.com/d/arthistory/1/0/W/O/raphael_colonna_01.jpg |title=Image |publisher=z.about.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202121830/http://z.about.com/d/arthistory/1/0/W/O/raphael_colonna_01.jpg |archive-date=December 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father's workshop continued and, probably together with his stepmother, Raphael evidently played a part in managing it from a very early age. In Urbino, he came into contact with the works of [[Paolo Uccello]], previously the court painter (d. 1475), and [[Luca Signorelli]], who until 1498 was based in nearby [[Città di Castello]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny: 4–5, 8 and 20&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Vasari, his father placed him in the workshop of the Umbrian master [[Pietro Perugino]] as an apprentice &quot;despite the tears of his mother&quot;.{{efn|After a visit to [[Verrocchio]]'s workshop, Santi recorded that both Perugino and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] were present, and seems to have viewed them as being at an equivalent skill level. After Leonardo left for Milan, Santi chose Perugino from one of two available artists to teach his son.{{sfn|Salmi et al.|1969|pp=11–12}}}} The evidence of an apprenticeship comes only from Vasari and another source,&lt;ref&gt;Simone Fornari in 1549–50, see Gould:207&lt;/ref&gt; and has been disputed; eight was very early for an apprenticeship to begin. An alternative theory is that he received at least some training from [[Timoteo Viti]], who acted as court painter in Urbino from 1495.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:8&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern historians agree that Raphael at least worked as an assistant to Perugino from around 1500; the influence of Perugino on Raphael's early work is very clear: &quot;probably no other pupil of genius has ever absorbed so much of his master's teaching as Raphael did&quot;, according to [[Heinrich Wölfflin|Wölfflin]].&lt;ref&gt;contrasting him with Leonardo and Michelangelo in this respect. Wölfflin:73&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari wrote that it was impossible to distinguish between their hands at this period, but many modern [[art historian]]s claim to do better and detect his hand in specific areas of works by Perugino or his workshop. Apart from stylistic closeness, their techniques are very similar as well, for example having paint applied thickly, using an oil varnish medium, in shadows and darker garments, but very thinly on flesh areas. An excess of resin in the varnish often causes [[Craquelure|cracking]] of areas of paint in the works of both masters.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny:17&lt;/ref&gt; The Perugino workshop was active in both [[Perugia]] and [[Florence]], perhaps maintaining two permanent branches.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:2–5&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael is described as a &quot;master&quot;, that is to say fully trained, in December 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlinger &amp; Ettlinger:19&lt;/ref&gt;

His first documented work was the ''[[Baronci altarpiece]]'' for the church of Saint [[Nicholas of Tolentino]] in Città di Castello, a town halfway between Perugia and Urbino.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlinger &amp; Ettlinger:20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evangelista da Pian di Meleto]], who had worked for his father, was also named in the commission. It was commissioned in 1500 and finished in 1501; now only some cut sections and a preparatory drawing remain.&lt;ref&gt;It was later seriously damaged during an earthquake in 1789.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years he painted works for other churches there, including the ''[[Mond Crucifixion]]'' (about 1503) and the [[Pinacoteca di Brera|Brera]] ''[[The Marriage of the Virgin (Raphael)|Wedding of the Virgin]]'' (1504), and for Perugia, such as the ''[[Oddi altar (Raphael)|Oddi Altarpiece]]''. He very probably also visited Florence in this period. These are large works, some in [[fresco]], where Raphael confidently marshals his compositions in the somewhat static style of Perugino. He also painted many small and exquisite [[cabinet painting]]s in these years, probably mostly for the connoisseurs in the Urbino court, like the ''[[Three Graces (Raphael)|Three Graces]]'' and ''[[St. Michael (Raphael)|St. Michael]]'', and he began to paint [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]] and portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny:5–8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1502 he went to [[Siena]] at the invitation of another pupil of [[Perugino]], [[Pinturicchio]], &quot;being a friend of Raphael and knowing him to be a draughtsman of the highest quality&quot; to help with the [[cartoon]]s, and very likely the designs, for a fresco series in the [[Piccolomini Library]] in [[Siena Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;One surviving preparatory drawing appears to be mostly by Raphael; quotation from Vasari by – Jones and Penny:20&lt;/ref&gt; He was evidently already much in demand even at this early stage in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlinger &amp; Ettlinger:25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Florence==

Raphael led a &quot;nomadic&quot; life, working in various centres in Northern Italy, but spent a good deal of time in Florence, perhaps from about 1504. Although there is traditional reference to a &quot;Florentine period&quot; of about 1504–1508, he was possibly never a continuous resident there.&lt;ref&gt;Gould:207-8&lt;/ref&gt; He may have needed to visit the city to secure materials in any case. There is a letter of recommendation of Raphael, dated October 1504, from the mother of the next Duke of Urbino to the [[Gonfaloniere of Florence]]: &quot;The bearer of this will be found to be Raphael, painter of Urbino, who, being greatly gifted in his profession has determined to spend some time in Florence to study. And because his father was most worthy and I was very attached to him, and the son is a sensible and well-mannered young man, on both accounts, I bear him great love...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny:5&lt;/ref&gt;

As earlier with Perugino and others, Raphael was able to assimilate the influence of Florentine art, whilst keeping his own developing style. Frescos in Perugia of about 1505 show a new monumental quality in the figures which may represent the influence of [[Fra Bartolomeo]], who Vasari says was a friend of Raphael. But the most striking influence in the work of these years is [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who returned to the city from 1500 to 1506. Raphael's figures begin to take more dynamic and complex positions, and though as yet his painted subjects are still mostly tranquil, he made drawn studies of fighting nude men, one of the obsessions of the period in Florence. Another drawing is a portrait of a young woman that uses the three-quarter length pyramidal composition of the just-completed ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', but still looks completely Raphaelesque. Another of Leonardo's compositional inventions, the pyramidal ''Holy Family'', was repeated in a series of works that remain among his most famous easel paintings. There is a drawing by Raphael in the [[Royal Collection]] of [[Leda and the Swan (Leonardo)|Leonardo's lost ''Leda and the Swan'']], from which he adapted the [[contrapposto]] pose of his own ''Saint Catherine of Alexandria''.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Gallery, London]] Jones &amp; Penny:44&lt;/ref&gt; He also perfects his own version of Leonardo's [[sfumato]] modelling, to give subtlety to his painting of flesh, and develops the interplay of glances between his groups, which are much less enigmatic than those of Leonardo. But he keeps the soft clear light of Perugino in his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:21–45&lt;/ref&gt;

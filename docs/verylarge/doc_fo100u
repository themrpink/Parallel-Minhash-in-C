'''Charles Monroe''' &quot;'''Sparky'''&quot; '''Schulz''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ʊ|l|t|s}}; November 26, 1922 – February 12, 2000)&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Boxer |first=Sarah |title=Charles M. Schulz, 'Peanuts' Creator, Dies at 77 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/021400obit-c-schulz.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 14, 2000 |access-date=October 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American cartoonist and creator of the comic strip ''[[Peanuts]]'' (which featured the characters [[Charlie Brown]] and [[Snoopy]], among others). He is widely regarded as one of the most influential cartoonists of all time, cited by cartoonists including [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]], [[Bill Watterson]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Dav Pilkey]] and [[Stephan Pastis]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:Charles Schulz HS Yearbook.jpg|thumb|left|Schulz's high school yearbook photo, 1940]]
Born in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt; Schulz grew up in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]]. He was the only child of Carl Schulz, who was born in [[German Empire|Germany]], and Dena Halverson, who had [[Norway|Norwegian]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Franzen |title=The Comfort Zone: Growing up with Charlie Brown |date=2004-11-29 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/11/29/the-comfort-zone |website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle called him &quot;Sparky&quot; after the horse Spark Plug in [[Billy DeBeck]]'s comic strip, ''[[Barney Google and Snuffy Smith|Barney Google]]'', which Schulz enjoyed reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Peanuts 1965–1966|author=Groth, Gary|publisher=Fantagraphic Books|chapter=Charles M. Schulz – 1922 to 2000|date=2007|isbn=978-1-56097-724-7|pages=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/google.htm|title=Don Markstein's Toonopedia: Barney Google|website=www.toonopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schulz loved drawing and sometimes drew his family dog, Spike, who ate unusual things, such as pins and tacks. In 1937, Schulz drew a picture of Spike and sent it to ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]''; his drawing appeared in [[Robert Ripley]]'s syndicated panel, captioned, &quot;A hunting dog that eats pins, tacks, and razor blades is owned by C. F. Schulz, St. Paul, Minn.&quot; and &quot;Drawn by 'Sparky'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mendelson, Lee |title=Charlie Brown &amp; Charlie Schulz |url=https://archive.org/details/charliebrownchar00mend_0 |url-access=registration |year=1970 |publisher=The World Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; (C.F. was his father, Carl Fred Schulz).&lt;ref name=&quot;mich1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Michaelis|2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schulz attended Richards Gordon Elementary School in Saint Paul, where he skipped two half-grades. He became a shy, timid teenager, perhaps as a result of being the youngest in his class at [[Saint Paul Central High School|Central High School]]. One well-known episode in his high school life was the rejection of his drawings by his high school yearbook, which he referred to in ''Peanuts'' years later, when he had Lucy ask Charlie Brown to sign a picture he drew of a horse, only to then say it was a prank.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/11/peanuts-matt-groening-jonathan-franzen | work=The Guardian |place=London | title=Oh boy, Charlie Brown | date=October 11, 2008 | access-date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A five-foot-tall statue of Snoopy was placed in the school's main office 60 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peanuts on Parade|url=https://www.johnweeks.com/tour/peanuts/snoopy.html|publisher=John Weeks|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service and post-war positions==
[[File:United States Army Portrait of Staff Sergeant Charles M. Schulz.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|United States Army portrait of staff sergeant Schulz, {{circa|1943}}]]
In February 1943, Schulz's mother Dena died after a long illness. At the time of her death, he had only recently been made aware that she suffered from [[cancer]]. Schulz had by all accounts been very close to his mother and her death had a significant effect on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PBS Special: Good Ol' Charles Schulz|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/charles-schulz/good-ol-charles-schulz/86/|publisher=PBS American Masters|access-date=October 29, 2007|date=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, Schulz was [[Conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States Army]]. He served as a staff sergeant with the [[20th Armored Division (United States)|20th Armored Division]] in Europe during [[World War II]], as a squad leader on a [[M2 Browning|.50 caliber machine gun team]]. His unit saw combat only at the very end of the war. Schulz said he had only one opportunity to fire his machine gun but forgot to load it, and that the German soldier he could have fired at willingly surrendered. Years later, Schulz proudly spoke of his wartime service.&lt;ref name=&quot;mich3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Michaelis|2007|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1945, Schulz returned to Minneapolis. He did lettering for a Roman Catholic comic magazine, ''Timeless Topix'', and in July 1946 took a job at [[Art Instruction Schools|Art Instruction, Inc.]], where he reviewed and graded students' work.&lt;ref name=Michaelis/&gt;{{rp|164}} Schulz had taken a [[Distance education|correspondence course]] from the school before he was drafted. He worked at the school for several years as he developed his career as a comic creator.

The first crisis of the reign came in 182, when Lucilla engineered a conspiracy against her brother. Her motive is alleged to have been envy of the [[Roman Empress|Empress]] [[Bruttia Crispina|Crispina]]. Her husband, Pompeianus, was not involved, but two men alleged to have been her lovers, [[Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus]] (the consul of 167, who was also her first cousin) and [[Appius Claudius Quintianus]], attempted to murder Commodus as he entered a theater. They bungled the job and were seized by the emperor's bodyguard.

Quadratus and Quintianus were executed. Lucilla was exiled to [[Capri]] and later killed. Pompeianus retired from public life. One of the two [[praetorian prefect]]s, [[Publius Tarrutenius Paternus]], had actually been involved in the conspiracy but his involvement was not discovered until later on, and in the aftermath, he and his colleague, [[Tigidius Perennis|Sextus Tigidius Perennis]], were able to arrange for the murder of Saoterus, the hated chamberlain.

Commodus took the loss of Saoterus badly, and Perennis now seized the chance to advance himself by implicating Paternus in a second conspiracy, one apparently led by [[Publius Salvius Julianus]], who was the son of the jurist [[Salvius Julianus]] and was betrothed to Paternus' daughter. Salvius and Paternus were executed along with a number of other prominent consulars and senators. [[Didius Julianus]], the future emperor and a relative of Salvius Julianus, was dismissed from the governorship of [[Germania Inferior]].

====Cleander====
Perennis took over the reins of government and Commodus found a new chamberlain and favourite in [[Marcus Aurelius Cleander|Cleander]], a [[Phrygia]]n [[freedman]] who had married one of the emperor's mistresses, Demostratia. Cleander was in fact the person who had murdered Saoterus. After those attempts on his life, Commodus spent much of his time outside Rome, mostly on the family estates at Lanuvium. As he was physically strong, his chief interest was in sport: he took part in [[horse racing]], [[chariot racing]], and combats with beasts and men, mostly in private but also on occasion in public.

===Dacia and Britain===
[[File:Commodus, Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna - 20100226.jpg|thumb|250px|A bust of Commodus ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna). According to [[Herodian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7DhHGX6wZkC&amp;pg=PA59|title=Septimius Severus: The African Emperor|first1=Anthony R.|last1=Birley|first2=Anthony R.|last2=Birley|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0203028599}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was well proportioned and attractive, with naturally [[blond]] and curly hair.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Wells (2004) [1984, 1992]. ''The Roman Empire''. Second Edition (sixth reprint edition). Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-77770-0}}, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Commodus was inaugurated in 183 as consul with Aufidius Victorinus for a colleague and assumed the title ''Pius''. War broke out in [[Dacia]]: few details are available, but it appears two future contenders for the throne, [[Clodius Albinus]] and [[Pescennius Niger]], both distinguished themselves in the campaign. Also, in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] in 184, the governor [[Ulpius Marcellus]] re-advanced the Roman frontier northward to the [[Antonine Wall]], but the [[legionaries]] revolted against his harsh discipline and acclaimed another legate, Priscus, as emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Dio Cassius 73.10.2, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscus refused to accept their acclamations, and Perennis had all the legionary [[legatus|legates]] in Britain [[Cashiering|cashiered]]. On 15 October 184 at the [[Capitoline Games]], a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher publicly denounced Perennis before Commodus.  His tale wasn't believed and he was immediately put to death. According to Dio Cassius, Perennis, though ruthless and ambitious, was not personally corrupt and generally administered the state well.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

However, the following year, a detachment of soldiers from Britain (they had been drafted to [[Roman Italy|Italy]] to suppress brigands) also denounced Perennis to the emperor as plotting to make his own son emperor (they had been enabled to do so by Cleander, who was seeking to dispose of his rival), and Commodus gave them permission to execute him as well as his wife and sons. The fall of Perennis brought a new spate of executions: Aufidius Victorinus committed suicide. Ulpius Marcellus was replaced as [[Governors of Roman Britain|governor of Britain]] by [[Pertinax]]; brought to Rome and tried for treason, Marcellus narrowly escaped death.

===Cleander's zenith and fall (185–190)===
[[File:1699 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - A youth, possibly Commodus - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 11 2009.jpg|thumb|Remnants of a Roman bust of a youth with a [[blond]] beard, perhaps depicting emperor Commodus, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]
Cleander proceeded to concentrate power in his own hands and to enrich himself by becoming responsible for all public offices: he sold and bestowed entry to the Senate, army commands, [[Roman governor|governorships]] and, increasingly, even the [[suffect consul]]ships to the highest bidder. Unrest around the empire increased, with large numbers of army deserters causing trouble in [[Gaul]] and [[Germania|Germany]]. Pescennius Niger mopped up the deserters in Gaul in a military campaign, and a revolt in [[Brittany]] was put down by two [[Roman legion|legions]] brought over from Britain.

In 187, one of the leaders of the deserters, [[Maternus (rebel)|Maternus]], came from Gaul intending to assassinate Commodus at the Festival of the Great Goddess in March, but he was betrayed and executed. In the same year, [[Pertinax]] unmasked a conspiracy by two enemies of Cleander&amp;nbsp;– [[Lucius Antistius Burrus|Antistius Burrus]] (one of Commodus' brothers-in-law) and [[Gaius Arrius Antoninus|Arrius Antoninus]]. As a result, Commodus appeared even more rarely in public, preferring to live on his estates.

Early in 188, Cleander disposed of the current praetorian prefect, [[Publius Atilius Aebutianus|Atilius Aebutianus]], and took over supreme command of the [[Praetorian Guard]] at the new rank of ''a pugione'' (&quot;dagger-bearer&quot;), with two praetorian prefects subordinate to him. Now at the zenith of his power, Cleander continued to sell public offices as his private business. The climax came in the year 190, which had 25 suffect consuls&amp;nbsp;– a record in the 1,000-year history of the Roman consulship—all appointed by Cleander (they included the future Emperor [[Septimius Severus]]).

In the spring of 190, Rome was afflicted by a food shortage, for which the ''praefectus annonae'' [[Papirius Dionysius]], the official actually in charge of the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|grain supply]], contrived to lay the blame on Cleander. At the end of June, a mob demonstrated against Cleander during a horse race in the [[Circus Maximus]]: he sent the Praetorian Guard to put down the disturbances, but Pertinax, who was now City Prefect of Rome, dispatched the ''[[Vigiles Urbani]]'' to oppose them. Cleander fled to Commodus, who was at [[Laurentum]] in the house of the [[Sextus Quinctilius Condianus|Quinctilii]], for protection, but the mob followed him calling for his head.

At the urging of his mistress [[Marcia (mistress of Commodus)|Marcia]], Commodus had Cleander beheaded and his son killed. Other victims at this time were the praetorian prefect Julius Julianus, Commodus' cousin [[Annia Fundania Faustina]], and his brother-in-law Mamertinus. Papirius Dionysius was executed, too.

The emperor now changed his name to Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus. At 29, he took over more of the reins of power, though he continued to rule through a cabal consisting of Marcia, his new chamberlain Eclectus, and the new praetorian prefect [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]].

===Megalomania (190–192)===
[[File:Denarius of Commodus (YORYM 2000 4292) obverse.jpg|thumb|A denarius of Commodus. Inscription: L. L. COMMODVS ANTONINVS AVG.]]
In opposition to the Senate, in his pronouncements and [[iconography]], Commodus had always stressed his unique status as a source of god-like power, liberality, and physical prowess. Innumerable statues around the empire were set up portraying him in the guise of [[Hercules]], reinforcing the image of him as a demigod, a physical giant, a protector, and a warrior who fought against men and beasts (see &quot;Commodus and Hercules&quot; and &quot;Commodus the Gladiator&quot; below). Moreover, as Hercules, he could claim to be the son of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the supreme god of the Roman [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. These tendencies now increased to [[megalomania]]cal proportions. Far from celebrating his descent from Marcus Aurelius, the actual source of his power, he stressed his own personal uniqueness as the bringer of a new order, seeking to re-cast the empire in his own image.

During 191, the city of Rome was extensively damaged by a fire that raged for several days, during which many public buildings including the [[Pax (mythology)|Temple of Pax]], the [[Temple of Vesta]], and parts of the imperial palace were destroyed.

Perhaps seeing this as an opportunity, early in 192 Commodus, declaring himself the new [[Romulus]], ritually re-founded Rome, renaming the city ''Colonia Lucia Annia Commodiana''. All the months of the year were renamed to correspond exactly with his (now twelve) names: ''Lucius'', ''Aelius'', ''Aurelius'', ''Commodus'', ''Augustus'', ''Herculeus'', ''Romanus'', ''Exsuperatorius'', ''Amazonius'', ''Invictus'', ''Felix'', and ''Pius''. The legions were renamed ''Commodianae'', the fleet which imported grain from [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] was termed ''Alexandria Commodiana Togata'', the Senate was entitled the Commodian Fortunate Senate, his palace and the Roman people themselves were all given the name ''Commodianus'', and the day on which these reforms were decreed was to be called ''Dies Commodianus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/commod.htm|title=Roman Emperors – DIR commodus|website=www.roman-emperors.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, he presented himself as the fountainhead of the Empire, Roman life, and religion. He also had the head of the [[Colossus of Nero]] adjacent to the [[Colosseum]] replaced with his own portrait, gave it a club, and placed a [[bronze]] [[lion]] at its feet to make it look like ''Hercules Romanus'', and added an inscription boasting of being &quot;the only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.22.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination (192)===
[[File:Römermuseum Osterburken (DerHexer) 2012-09-30 008.jpg|thumb|[[Damnatio memoriae]] of Commodus on an inscription in the Museum of Roman History [[Osterburken]]. The abbreviation &quot;CO&quot; has been restored with paint.]]
In November 192, Commodus held Plebeian Games, in which he shot hundreds of animals with arrows and javelins every morning, and fought as a gladiator every afternoon, winning all the fights. In December, he announced his intention to inaugurate the year 193 as both consul and gladiator on 1 January.

At this point, the prefect Laetus formed a conspiracy with Eclectus to supplant Commodus with Pertinax, taking Marcia into their confidence. On 31 December, Marcia poisoned Commodus' food but he vomited up the poison, so the conspirators sent his wrestling partner [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]] to strangle him in his bath. Upon his death, the Senate declared him a public enemy (a ''de facto'' ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'') and restored the original name of the city of Rome and its institutions. Statues of Commodus were demolished. His body was buried in the [[Mausoleum of Hadrian]].

Commodus' death marked the end of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]].
Commodus was succeeded by [[Pertinax]], whose reign was short-lived; he would become the first claimant to be usurped during the [[Year of the Five Emperors]].

In 195, the emperor [[Septimius Severus]], trying to gain favour with the family of Marcus Aurelius, rehabilitated Commodus' memory and had the Senate [[Apotheosis|deify]] him.&lt;ref&gt;To “accept kinship with Commodus&amp;nbsp;... the bluntly pragmatic decision was taken to deify the former emperor, thus legitimizing Severus’ seizure of power.”  See [[Annelise Freisenbruch]], ''Caesars' Wives: Sex, Power, and Politics in the Roman Empire'' (London and New York: Free Press, 2010), 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character and physical prowess==
===Character and motivations===
[[File:Commode pièce.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Denarius]] of Commodus. Inscription: ΑΥΤ. ΚΑΙC. KOMMOΔΟC CEB. / ΓEP. CAP. ΔHMαρχικής EΞουσίας Δ΄, YΠATος B΄ (greek inscription for GER. SAR. Municipal Authority IV, Consul II).]]
[[File:Commodo, 180-192 dc, collez. albani.JPG|thumb|Bust of Commodus from the [[Capitoline Museum]]]]
Cassius Dio, a first-hand witness, describes him as &quot;not naturally wicked but, on the contrary, as guileless as any man that ever lived. His great simplicity, however, together with his cowardice, made him the slave of his companions, and it was through them that he at first, out of ignorance, missed the better life and then was led on into lustful and cruel habits, which soon became second nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.1.2, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;

His recorded actions do tend to show a rejection of his father's policies, his father's advisers, and especially his father's austere lifestyle, and an alienation from the surviving members of his family. It seems likely that he was brought up in an atmosphere of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[asceticism]], which he rejected entirely upon his accession to sole rule.

After repeated attempts on Commodus' life, [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]] were often killed for making him angry. One such notable event was the attempted extermination of the house of the Quinctilii. Condianus and Maximus were executed on the pretext that, while they were not implicated in any plots, their wealth and talent would make them unhappy with the current state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.5.3, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt; Another event—as recorded by the historian [[Aelius Lampridius]]—took place at the Roman baths at [[Terme Taurine]], where the emperor had an attendant thrown into an oven after he found his bathwater to be lukewarm.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta. C 1, 9. – Historia Augusta Bd. 1, eingeleitet und übersetzt von E. Hohl, bearbeitet und übersetzt von E. Merten (1976) 138. – E. Mer-ten, Bäder und Badegepflogenheiten in der Darstel-lung der Historia Augusta (Antiquitas. Reihe 4, Bd. 16. 1983) 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinz, W. (1986). Die &lt;nowiki&gt;''Terme Taurine''&lt;/nowiki&gt; von Civitavecchia – ein römisches Heilbad. ''Antike Welt,'' ''17''(4), 22–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes of name===
His original name was Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus.{{sfn|Hammond|p=32}} On his father's death in 180, Commodus changed this to Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Commodus, before changing back to his birth name in 191.{{sfn|Hammond|pp=32–33}}

Later that year he adopted as his full style Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus Augustus Herculeus Romanus Exsuperatorius Amazonius Invictus Felix Pius (the order of some of these titles varies in the sources). &quot;Exsuperatorius&quot; (the supreme) was a title given to Jupiter, and &quot;Amazonius&quot; identified him again with Hercules.

An inscribed altar from [[Dura-Europos]] on the Euphrates shows that Commodus' titles and the renaming of the months were disseminated to the furthest reaches of the Empire; moreover, that even auxiliary military units received the title Commodiana, and that Commodus claimed two additional titles: ''Pacator Orbis'' (pacifier of the world) and ''Dominus Noster'' (Our Lord). The latter eventually would be used as a conventional title by Roman emperors, starting about a century later, but Commodus seems to have been the first to assume it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spiedel |first=M. P |year=1993 |title=Commodus the God-Emperor and the Army |journal=Journal of Roman Studies |volume=83 |pages=109–114 |doi=10.2307/300981|jstor=300981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commodus and Hercules===
Disdaining the more philosophic inclinations of his father, Commodus was extremely proud of his physical prowess. The historian Herodian, a contemporary, described Commodus as an extremely handsome man.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Michael. The Roman Emperors (1985) p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, he ordered many statues to be made showing him dressed as Hercules with a lion's hide and a club. He thought of himself as the reincarnation of Hercules, frequently emulating the legendary hero's feats by appearing in the arena to fight a variety of wild animals. He was left-handed and very proud of the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, Cassius. Roman History: Epitome of Book LXXIII pp 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius Dio and the writers of the ''[[Historia Augusta|Augustan History]]'' say that Commodus was a skilled archer, who could shoot the heads off [[ostrich]]es in full gallop, and kill a [[Black panther|panther]] as it attacked a victim in the arena.

===Commodus the gladiator===
Commodus also had a passion for gladiatorial combat, which he took so far as to take to the [[arena]] himself, dressed as a [[secutor]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward. The history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Vol. 5. Methuen, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans found Commodus' gladiatorial combats to be scandalous and disgraceful.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian's Roman History F.L. Muller Edition 1.15.7&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Herodian]], spectators of Commodus thought it unbecoming of an emperor to take up arms in the amphitheater for sport when he could be campaigning against [[barbarians]] among other opponents of Rome. The consensus was that it was below his office to participate as a gladiator.&lt;ref&gt;Echols, Edward C. &quot;Herodian of Antioch's History of the Roman Empire.&quot; English translation) UCLA Press, Berkeley CA (1961), 1.15.1-9&lt;/ref&gt; Popular rumors spread alleging he was actually the son, not of Marcus Aurelius, but of a gladiator whom his mother Faustina had taken as a lover at the coastal resort of [[Caieta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'', Life of Marcus Aurelius, XIX. The film ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'' makes use of this story: one of the characters is an old gladiator who eventually reveals himself to be Commodus' real father.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the arena, Commodus' [[Tomato can (sports idiom)|opponents always submitted to the emperor]]; as a result he never lost. Commodus never killed his gladiatorial adversaries, instead accepting their surrenders. His victories were often welcomed by his bested opponents, as bearing scars dealt by the hand of an Emperor was considered a mark of fortitude.&lt;ref&gt;Dio (Cassius.), and Earnest Cary. Roman History. Harvard University Press, 1961, 73.10.3&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of Rome missing their feet through accident or illness were taken to the arena, where they were tethered together for Commodus to club to death while pretending they were giants.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.20.3, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt; Privately, it was also his custom to kill his opponents during practice matches.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.10.3&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=What does this mean? Who were the practice opponents? How did he slay them?|date=January 2018}} For each appearance in the arena, he charged the city of Rome a million [[sestertius|sesterces]], straining the Roman economy.

Commodus was also known for fighting exotic animals in the arena, often to the horror and disgust of the Roman people. According to Cassius Dio, Commodus once killed 100 lions in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon p.. 106 &quot;disgorged at once a hundred lions; a hundred darts&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he decapitated a running [[ostrich]] with a specially designed dart&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: Volume I'' Everyman's Library (Knopf) New York. 1910. p. 106 &quot;with arrows whose point was shaped in the form of a crescent&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards carried his sword and the bleeding head of the dead bird over to the Senators' seating area and motioned as though they were next.&lt;ref name=foxcomm&gt;Lane Fox, Robin ''The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian'' Basic Books.  2006 p. 446 &quot;brandishing a sword in one hand and bloodied neck...He gesticulated at the Senate.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Dio notes that the targeted senators actually found this more ridiculous than frightening, and chewed on [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] leaves to conceal their laughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html Roman History by Cassius Dio] penelope.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt;  On another occasion, Commodus killed three [[elephant]]s on the floor of the arena by himself.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, H. H ''The Elephant in the Greek and Roman World'' Thames and Hudson. 1974 p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Commodus killed a [[giraffe]], which was considered to be a strange and helpless beast.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon p. 107 &quot;*1 Commodus killed a camelopardalis or giraffe&amp;nbsp;... the most useless of the quadrupeds&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery mode=&quot;packed&quot; heights=&quot;220px&quot;&gt;

'''Mīrzā Muhammad Tāraghay bin Shāhrukh''' ({{lang-chg|میرزا محمد طارق بن شاہ رخ}}, {{lang-fa|میرزا محمد تراغای بن شاہ رخ}}), better known as '''Ulugh Beg''' ({{Nastaliq|الغ‌ بیگ}}) (22 March 1394 – 27 October 1449), was a [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] [[sultan]], as well as an [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]] and [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]]. 

Ulugh Beg was notable for his work in astronomy-related mathematics, such as [[trigonometry]] and [[spherical geometry]], as well as his general interests in the arts and intellectual activities.&lt;ref&gt;Science in Islamic civilisation: proceedings of the international symposia: &quot;Science institutions in Islamic civilisation&quot;, &amp; &quot;Science and technology in the Turkish and Islamic world&quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ki3YAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ulugh+beg+cultural+centre+observatory&amp;dq=ulugh+beg+cultural+centre+observatory&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ntlYT9-_JsfO8QOig-jsDg&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCDgK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Ulugh Beg |website=OU Libraries |publisher=Britannica Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that he spoke five languages: [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkic language|Turkic]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], and a small amount of [[Mandarin language|Chinese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Samarkand: Ulugh Beg's Observatory |url=https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/uz/samarkand/obser.html |website=Depts.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his rule (first as a governor, then outright) the [[Timurid Empire]] achieved the cultural peak of the [[Timurid Renaissance]] through his attention and patronage. [[Samarkand]] was captured and given to Ulugh Beg by his father [[Shah Rukh]].{{fact|date=November 2019}}

He built the great [[Ulugh Beg Observatory]] in Samarkand between 1424 and 1429. It was considered by scholars to have been one of the finest observatories in the Islamic world at the time and the largest in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Science in Islamic civilisation: proceedings of the international symposia: &quot;Science institutions in Islamic civilisation&quot;, &amp; &quot;Science and technology in the Turkish and Islamic world&quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ki3YAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ulugh+beg+cultural+centre+observatory&amp;dq=ulugh+beg+cultural+centre+observatory&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ntlYT9-_JsfO8QOig-jsDg&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCDgK]&lt;/ref&gt; Ulugh Beg was subsequently recognized as the most important observational astronomer from the 15th century by many scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/paksoy-2/cam6.html|title=The Legacy of Ulugh Beg {{!}} Central Asian Monuments {{!}} Edited by H.

Mekking [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qi3NPTlVX0QC&amp;pg=PA121]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Ulugh Beg's scientific expertise was not matched by his skills in governance. During his short reign, he failed to establish his power and authority. As a result, other rulers, including his family, took advantage of his lack of control, and he was subsequently overthrown and assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ulugh Beg |url=https://academic-eb-com.ezproxy.lib.ou.edu/levels/collegiate/article/Ulūgh-Beg/74183 |website=The University of Oklahoma Libraries |publisher=Britannica Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
He was a grandson of the great conqueror, [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) (1336–1405), and the oldest son of [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rukh]], both of whom came from the Turkicized&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], &quot;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-7271 Timur]&quot;, Online Academic Edition, 2007. Quotation: &quot;Timur was a member of the Turkicized Barlas tribe, a Mongol subgroup that had settled in Transoxania...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barlas]] tribe of [[Transoxiana]] (now [[Uzbekistan]]). His mother was a noblewoman named [[Gawhar Shad]], daughter of a member of the representative Turkic&lt;ref&gt;V. V. Bartold. ''Улугбек и его время'' [''Ulug Beg and his time'']. [[St Petersburg]] (1918). p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opklare.ru/m/ulugbek_-_biografiya|script-title=ru:Улугбек - Биография|title=Ulug Beg – Biografiya |website=Opklare.ru|accessdate=January 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; tribal aristocracy, Ghiyasuddin Tarkhan. 

Ulugh Beg was born in [[Sultaniyeh]] during his grandfather's invasion of [[Persia]]. He was given the name ''[[Mirza|Mīrzā]] Muhammad Tāraghay''. Ulugh Beg, the name he most commonly known by, was not truly a personal name, but rather a [[moniker]], which can be loosely translated as &quot;Great Ruler&quot; (compare modern Turkish ''[[wikt:ulu|ulu]]'', &quot;great&quot;, and ''[[wikt:bey|bey]]'', &quot;chief&quot;) and is the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] equivalent of [[Timur]]'s Perso-Arabic title ''Amīr-e Kabīr''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI&quot;&gt;B. F. Manz, &quot;Tīmūr Lang&quot;, in ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Online Edition, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a child he wandered through a substantial part of the Middle East and [[India]] as his grandfather expanded his conquests in those areas. After Timur's death, Shah Rukh moved the empire's capital to [[Herat, Afghanistan|Herat]] (in modern [[Afghanistan]]). Sixteen-year-old Ulugh Beg subsequently became the governor of the former capital of Samarkand in 1409. In 1411, he was named the sovereign ruler of the whole of [[Transoxiana|Mavarannahr]].

The '''[[Paddle steamer|PS]] ''Lady Elgin''''' was a wooden-hulled [[Paddle steamer#Sidewheeler|sidewheel]] [[steamship]] that sank in [[Lake Michigan]] off the fledgling town of Port Clinton, Illinois, whose geography is now divided between [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]] and  [[Highwood, Illinois]], after she was rammed in a gale by the [[schooner]] ''Augusta'' in the early hours of September 8, 1860. The passenger manifest was lost with the collision, but the sinking of ''Lady Elgin'' resulted in the loss of about 300 lives&lt;ref name=&quot;Supervising Inspectors page 43&quot;&gt;Journal of Board of Supervising Inspectors, Vol 1, page 43, National Archives Record Group 41&lt;/ref&gt; in what was called &quot;one of the greatest marine horrors on record&quot;.  Four years after the disaster, a new rule required sailing vessels to carry running lights. The ''Lady Elgin'' disaster remains the greatest loss of life on open water in the history of the Great Lakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Story&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Wreck of the ''Lady Elgin'': 150th Anniversary Commemorative Event|url=http://programs.discoveryworld.org/?tag=shipwreck|access-date=October 24, 2010 | publisher=Discovery World at Pier Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a process began to list the shipwreck on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  After it was determined to be eligible for listing in 1999, the process ended after an objection by the owner, so the shipwreck is not listed on the Register.&lt;ref&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:1857 Bird's Eye View of Chicago.jpg|thumb|left|1857 Bird's eye view of Chicago, with the Lady Elgin at bottom right]]
''Lady Elgin'' was built in 1851 in Buffalo, New York, at a cost of $95,000. She was named after the wife of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], Canada's Governor General from 1847 to 1854.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternwheelers &amp; Sidewheelers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Charlebois | first = Peter | title = Sternwheelers and Sidewheelers | publisher = NC Press Limited | year = 1978 | location = Toronto | pages = 10 | isbn = 0-919600-72-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time, the wooden-hulled [[sidewheeler]] was one of the most elegantly appointed passenger ships plying the [[Great Lakes]]. Rated a first-class [[Steamboat|steamer]], she was a favorite with the traveling public. Early in her career she ran between [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and Chicago, then later between Chicago and [[Collingwood, Ontario]]. For many of her later seasons, she plied the route between Chicago and other Lake Michigan ports and [[Lake Superior]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Great Lakes|url=http://www.mfhn.com/glsdb/archivestemp/ldyelgn.html|access-date=February 22, 2009 |publisher=rootsweb.ancestry.com/~migenweb/ Publisher, Chicago: J.H. Beers &amp; Co, 1899. Reproduced by Michigan Genealogy on the Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During ''Lady Elgin''{{'}}s career she was involved in numerous accidents. She sank and was repaired in 1854 after striking a rock at [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin]]. In 1855, she was towed to Chicago after an accident to her machinery. In 1857, she was damaged by fire. In June 1858, she struck a reef at [[Copper Harbor, Michigan]]. In August 1858, she was stranded on [[Au Sable Light|Au Sable Point Reef]] in Lake Superior. In October 1859, she was towed to [[Marquette, Michigan]] after breaking her [[crossbeam]]. In November 1859, she was towed again when her [[crank pin]] broke near [[Point Iroquois]], Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Lady Elgin''|url = http://www.greatlakesships.org/vesselview.aspx?id=74930|access-date = February 22, 2009|publisher = Alpena County Public Library|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726131318/http://www.greatlakesships.org/vesselview.aspx?id=74930|archive-date = July 26, 2011|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her final blow came in 1860 when she was rammed by the wooden [[schooner]] ''Augusta'' ten miles from shore. In 1899, Great Lakes historian J.B. Mansfield called ''Lady Elgin'''s sinking &quot;one of the greatest marine horrors on record&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot; /&gt;

==Final voyage==
[[File:LadyElginCollision1860.jpg|thumb|A woodcut engraving of the collision from ''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]'']]
On the night of September 6, 1860 ''Lady Elgin'' left [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], from the Dooley, Martin, Dousman, and Company Dock, for Chicago, carrying members of [[Milwaukee]]'s Union Guard to hear a campaign speech by [[Stephen A. Douglas]], [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s opponent, although there is no clear historical evidence that Douglas actually appeared. Three hundred men and women spent the day of September 7 listening to political speeches followed by an evening of entertainment by a German brass band on board ''Lady Elgin''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternwheelers &amp; Sidewheelers&quot; /&gt; On the return trip that night, the brightly lit ''Lady Elgin'' was steaming through [[Lake Michigan]] against [[gale force]] winds when she was rammed by the schooner ''Augusta of Oswego''. ''Augusta'' was sailing using only a single white light, mounted on a five-foot Samson&lt;!--what's this?--&gt; on the bow, and did not attempt, or was unable, to turn to avoid the collision in the gale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Dwight|title=True Tales of the Great Lakes|year=1971|publisher=Freshwater Press Inc.|location=Cleveland, OH|isbn=0-912514-48-5|pages=177–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the morning of the collision (September 8) at 2:30 am, ''Augusta'' rammed the port side of ''Lady Elgin'', damaging her own bowsprit and headgear, while holing the latter ship below the waterline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--need more details about the collision itself: which struck what where, what immediate and subsequent damage was sustained, etc.--&gt;

Concerned that she was damaged and believing ''Lady Elgin'' had got safely away, ''Augusta'' made for Chicago. Aboard ''Lady Elgin'', Captain Wilson ordered that cattle and cargo be thrown overboard to lighten the load and raise the gaping hole in ''Lady Elgin's'' [[port]] side above water level while the [[Chief Steward|steward]] was down in the coal bunker trying to stop the leak with mattresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coroner's Inquest&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The Lady Elgin Disaster; Coroner'S Inquest at Chicago Testimony of Persons On Board the Two Vessels |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1860/09/13/78644856.pdf|access-date=February 22, 2009 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 13, 1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Wilson ordered a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] lowered on the [[starboard]] side to check the extent of the damage but it never regained the steamer. Within twenty minutes, ''Lady Elgin'' broke apart, and all but the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] section rapidly sank. The night was lit up at intervals by flashes of lightning showing the scattered wreckage.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot; /&gt;

The [[Personal flotation device|life preservers]], {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}} hardwood planks, {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide, were never used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternwheelers &amp; Sidewheelers&quot; /&gt;  Two boats with a total of 18 persons reached shore.  In addition, fourteen people were saved on a large raft and many others on parts of the wreckage. Over 300 lives were lost and 98 saved.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot; /&gt; The drummer of the German band, Charles Beverung, saved himself by using his large [[bass drum]] as a life preserver.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternwheelers &amp; Sidewheelers&quot; /&gt; Survivors reported the heroic efforts of Captain Wilson to save about 300 persons collected on a raft.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot; /&gt;  When day broke, between 350 and 400 passengers and crew were drifting in stormy waters, holding on to anything they could, many only to be pulled under by breakers near shore.

Students from [[Northwestern University]] and [[Garrett Biblical Institute]] were watching the shore on the morning of September 8, looking for survivors.  One of the students, Edward Spencer, is credited with rescuing 17 passengers over the course of six hours.  He sustained injuries during his rescue efforts that left him an invalid for the rest of his life.  A plaque in his honor was first placed in the Northwestern University Gymnasium, and is now housed in the Northwestern University Library.&lt;ref name=&quot;ship-wrecks.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ship-wrecks.net/shipwreck/projects/elgin/|title=Lady Elgin|work=ship-wrecks.net|access-date=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2009/01/17502/wrecked-the-story-of-northwesterns-first-varsity-sport/|title=Wrecked: The story of Northwestern's first &quot;varsity sport&quot;|work=northbynorthwestern.com|access-date=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 300 people died in the sinking,&lt;ref name=&quot;Supervising Inspectors page 43&quot; /&gt; including Captain Wilson, who was lost trying to save two women when he was caught by the surf and forced into the rocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;ship-wrecks.net&quot; /&gt; Most were from Milwaukee with the majority of those from the Irish communities, including nearly all of Milwaukee's Irish Union Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theirishpub.us/general/default.aspx?pageid=5 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728151710/http://www.theirishpub.us/general/default.aspx?pageid=5 |archivedate=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So many Irish-American political operatives died that day that the disaster has been credited with transferring the balance of political power in Milwaukee &quot;from the Irish to the Germans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Zych v. Wrecked Vessel believed to be Lady Elgin'', 960 F.2d 665, 667 (7th Cir. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is said that more than 1000 children were orphaned by the tragedy, however research shows that there were fewer than 40 children orphaned.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lost on the Lady Elgin&quot;, Valerie van Heest, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2012}} The ''Lady Elgin'' disaster remains the greatest loss of life on open water in the history of the Great Lakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Story&quot; /&gt;

==Memorials==
[[File:Sinking of The Lady Elgin sign 7930.jpg|thumb|right|State of Wisconsin Historical Marker for ''Lady Elgin'']]
A Wisconsin historical marker in the [[Historic Third Ward, Milwaukee|historic third ward]] in Milwaukee commemorates the tragedy. [[Calvary Cemetery, Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Calvary Cemetery]] in Milwaukee has a monument dedicated to the ''Lady Elgin'' disaster and the many lost in the tragedy who are buried there. For many years in central Canada the memorial song &quot;Lost on the Lady Elgin&quot; was sung at family gatherings and social occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternwheelers &amp; Sidewheelers&quot; /&gt;  The Milwaukee Irish Heritage and Cultural Center has spearheaded a $200,000 project for a mammoth, two-story bronze memorial statue for the ''Lady Elgin'' disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Lady Elgin'' Memorial Statue|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/29581034.html|access-date=February 22, 2009|publisher=Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maritime rulings==
Following the sinking, ''Lady Elgin's'' owner, [[Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard]], received a $12,000 payment from his [[insurance]] company, but neither he nor the insurance company accepted abandonment of the ship.  The captain of ''Augusta'', Darius Malott, was arrested and tried in Chicago, but found not guilty of navigational negligence.  A coroner's jury declared his second-mate, Mr. Budge, to be incompetent, and his crew to be of principal blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= | work = New York Times | date = September 25, 1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Professor Mason and Lieutenant Bartlett asserted that a principal cause of the collision was the lack of a $15 lantern on the Augusta - see Polytechnic Association of the American Institute, Scientific American, New Series, Vol 3, Issue 14, page 214.(September 29, 1860). Steamboat historian Peter Charlebois noted that, after the investigation, Captain Malott and ''Lady Elgin's'' crew and owners were absolved of any blame.  He reported:  &lt;blockquote&gt;The judgement was based on a law that not only gave sail the right of way over steam, but did not require sailing vessels to carry running lights.  Apparently ''Augusta'' had sighted the passenger steamer twenty minutes before the collision but in the rain had misjudged the distance between them.  Four years after the disaster, in 1864, a new ruling was made requiring sailing vessels to carry running lights.  Since there were still nearly 1,900 ships under sail by 1870 the regulations were long overdue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternwheelers &amp; Sidewheelers&quot; /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Wreck==
The wreck of ''Lady Elgin'' was discovered in 1989 off [[Highwood, Illinois|Highwood]], Illinois by Harry Zych.  Zych was awarded ownership in 1999 after a protracted legal battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Zych v. Wrecked Vessel believed to be Lady Elgin'', 960 F.2d 665 (7th Cir. 1992), ''cert. denied'', 1994; ''People ex rel. Illinois Historic Preservation Agency v. Zych'', 186 Ill. 2d 267, 710 N.E.2d 820 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  The wreck, consisting of four main debris fields lying in {{convert|50|and|60|ft|m}} of water, has been stripped of artifacts through the years.  Divers must obtain permission from Zych and ''Lady Elgin'' Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Baillod | first = Brendon | title = The Wreck of the Steamer Lady Elgin | publisher = Ship-wreck.com | url = http://www.ship-wreck.com/shipwreck/projects/elgin | access-date = February 2, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724083134/http://www.ship-wreck.com/shipwreck/projects/elgin | archive-date = July 24, 2011 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are expected to observe the preservation laws governing historic sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places, Lake County, Illinois|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/IL/Lake/vacant.html|access-date=February 22, 2009|publisher=National Register of Historic Places}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck site has been cataloged by the Underwater Archaeological Society of Chicago.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

==Microbial physiology==
An interesting feature peculiar to some of the ''Yersinia'' bacteria is the ability to not only survive, but also to actively proliferate at temperatures as low as 1–4&amp;nbsp;°C (e.g., on cut salads and other food products in a refrigerator). ''Yersinia'' bacteria are relatively quickly inactivated by [[oxidizing agent]]s such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[potassium permanganate]] solutions.

The '''Chicago flood''' occurred on April 13, 1992, when repair work on a bridge spanning the [[Chicago River]] damaged the wall of an abandoned and disused utility tunnel beneath the river. The resulting breach flooded basements, facilities and the underground [[Chicago Pedway]] throughout the [[Chicago Loop]] with an estimated {{convert|250|e6USgal|m3|-6}} of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = 1992 Loop Flood Brings Chaos, Billions In Losses |publisher = [[WBBM-TV]] |location = Chicago |url = http://cbs2chicago.com/vault/local_story_104140940.html |date = April 14, 2007 |access-date = January 11, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231222/http://cbs2chicago.com/vault/local_story_104140940.html |archive-date = September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The remediation lasted for weeks, and cost about $2 billion in 1992 dollars, equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|2000000000|1992}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}. The legal battles lasted for several years, and disagreement over who was at fault persists to this day.

==Cause==
[[File:Kinzie Street bridge 20100731.jpg|thumb|right|Kinzie Street Bridge]]
Rehabilitation work on the [[Kinzie Street Bridge]]&lt;!--not the railroad bridge--&gt; crossing the Chicago River required new pilings. However, when the City of Chicago specified that the old pilings be extracted and replaced by the new ones, the [[Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company]] reported back that the old pilings were too close to the [[bridge tender's house]], preventing proper removal without risking damaging or destroying the house. The City of Chicago then gave permission to install the new pilings {{convert|3.5|ft|m}} south of the old pilings. The crew members who began work at the site did not know that beneath the river was an abandoned [[Chicago Tunnel Company]] (CTC) tunnel that had been used in the early 20th century to transport coal and goods. One of the pilings on the east bank was driven into the bottom of the river alongside the north wall of the old tunnel. The pilings did not punch through the tunnel wall, but clay soil displaced by the piling eventually breached the wall, allowing sediment and water to seep into the tunnel. After some weeks, most of the clay between the water and the breach had liquefied, which rapidly increased the rate of flooding in the tunnel. The situation became problematic because the flood doors had been removed from the old tunnels after they fell into disuse.

== Discovery of the leak ==
A skilled telecommunications worker inspecting a cable running through the tunnel discovered the leak while it was still passing mud and forwarded a videotape to [[Chicago|the city]], which did not see anything serious and began a bid process to repair the tunnel. The CTC tunnels were never formally a public responsibility, as most of them had been dug clandestinely, many violated private property&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbez.org/shows/curious-city/six-tunnels-hidden-under-chicagos-loop/a4a5fc40-fbd6-415e-96b1-29d767363e57|title=Six Tunnels Hidden Under Chicago's Loop|last=Amer|first=Robin|website=WBEZ|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the collapse of the operator had failed to resolve ownership and maintenance responsibilities. Meanwhile, the mud continued to push through until the river water was able to pour in unabated, creating an immediate emergency.

==Effects==
The water flooded into the basements of several Loop office buildings and retail stores and an underground shopping district.  The Loop and financial district were evacuated, and electrical power and gas were interrupted in most of the area as a precaution. Trading at the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] ended in mid-morning as water seeped into their basements. At its height, some buildings had {{convert|40|ft|m|0}} of water in their lower levels. However, at the street level there was no water to be seen, as it was all underground.

At first, the source of the water was unclear. [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ radio]] reporter Larry Langford reported that city crews were in the process of shutting down large water mains to see if the water flow could be stopped.
Monitoring police scanners, Langford heard security crews from Chicago's [[Merchandise Mart]] (near the Kinzie Street Bridge) report that the water in their basement had fish. Langford drove to the Merchandise Mart, then reported over the air that water was swirling near a piling in a manner similar to water going down a bathtub drain. Within minutes emergency services were converging on the bridge.

==Repair and cleanup==
Workers attempted to plug the hole, by then about {{convert|20|ft|m}} wide, with 65 truckloads of rocks, cement and old mattresses.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In an attempt to slow the leak, the level of the Chicago River was lowered by  opening the locks downstream of Chicago,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} and the freight tunnels were drained into the [[Tunnel and Reservoir Plan|Chicago Deep Tunnel]] system.  The leak was eventually stopped by placing a specialized concrete mixture supplied by Material Service Corporation (MSC) and placed by Kenny Construction. The concrete was designed by Brian Rice of MSC and was to set up so quickly that the concrete delivery trucks were provided police escorts. The concrete was placed into drilled shafts into the flooded tunnel near Kinzie Street and formed emergency plugs. 

==Aftermath==
It took three days before the flood was cleaned up enough to allow business to begin to resume and cost the city an estimated $1.95 billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|1950000000|1992}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}). Some buildings remained closed for a few weeks. Parking was banned downtown during the cleanup and some subway routes were temporarily closed or rerouted. Since it occurred near [[Tax Day]], the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] granted natural disaster extensions to those affected.

Eventually, the city assumed maintenance responsibility for the tunnels, and watertight hatches were installed at the river crossings. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Co. sued the City of Chicago arguing that the city had failed to tell it about the existence of the tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Company Blamed for Flood Files a Suit Faulting Chicago |work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date = October 11, 1992 |page = 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Insurance battles lasted for years, the central point being the definition of the accident, i.e., whether it was a &quot;flood&quot; or a &quot;leak&quot;. Leaks were covered by insurance, while floods were not. Eventually it was classified as a leak, which is why many residents still call it the &quot;Great Chicago Leak&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Hejmanowski | first=David | title=Examining the ‘Great Chicago Leak’ | website=Delaware Gazette | date=August 17, 2018 | url=https://www.delgazette.com/opinion/70414/examining-the-great-chicago-leak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there remains contention as to whether the mistake was the fault of the workers on-site, their parent company, or even the claim that maps provided by the City of Chicago failed to accurately depict the old tunnel systems. In fact, the Kinzie Street river crossing was clearly delineated on the city maps: the typical tunnel ran down the center of the old streets. At Kinzie Street, like some of the other river crossings, it veered off to the side as the historic Kinzie bridge (at the time of the tunnel construction) was a pivoting bridge with a central pivot in the middle of the street. Thus the original tunnels were moved to the side, as were several other bridges across the Chicago River—shown in detail on the city maps.{{cn|date=July 2012}}

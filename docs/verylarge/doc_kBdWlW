===American Revolutionary War===
From its initiation, the [[American Revolutionary War]] was, necessarily, a showcase for asymmetric techniques. In the 1920s, [[Harold Murdock]] of [[Boston]] attempted to solve the puzzle of the first shots fired on [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington Green]], and came to the suspicion that the few score militia men who gathered before sunrise to await the arrival of hundreds of well-prepared British soldiers were sent specifically to provoke an incident which could be used for propaganda purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/harold-murdock%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9C-nineteenth-april-1775%E2%80%9D|title=Harold Murdock's &quot;The Nineteenth Of April 1775&quot;|access-date=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The return of the British force to Boston following the search operations at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]] was subject to constant [[skirmisher|skirmishing]], using [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] forces gathered from communities all along the route, making maximum use of the terrain (particularly trees and stone field walls) to overcome the limitations of their weapons – [[musket]]s with an effective range of only about 50–70 metres. Throughout the war, skirmishing tactics against British troops on the move continued to be a key factor in the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots']] success; however, they may also have encouraged the occasional incidents, particularly in the later stages, where British troops used alleged surrender violations as a justification for killing large numbers of captives (e.g., [[Waxhaw Massacre|Waxhaw]] and [[Battle of Groton Heights|Groton Heights]]).

Another feature of the long march from Concord was the urban warfare technique of using buildings along the route as additional cover for [[sniper]]s. When revolutionary forces forced their way into [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and used waterfront buildings as cover for shots at British vessels out in the river, the response of destruction of those buildings was ingeniously used to the advantage of the rebels, who encouraged the spread of fire throughout the largely [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] town, and spread propaganda blaming it on the British. Shortly afterwards they destroyed the remaining houses, on the grounds that they might provide cover for British soldiers. British forces never adopted a popular response to partisan-style asymmetric warfare—retribution massacres of groups selected on a semi-random basis from the population at large.

The rebels also adopted a form of asymmetric [[sea warfare]], by using small, fast vessels to avoid the [[Royal Navy]], and capturing or sinking large numbers of merchant ships; however the British responded by issuing [[letter of marque|letters of marque]] permitting private armed vessels to undertake reciprocal attacks on enemy shipping. [[John Paul Jones]] became notorious in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] for his expedition from France in the little sloop of war ''[[USS Ranger (1777)|Ranger]]'' in April 1778, during which, in addition to his attacks on merchant shipping, he made two landings on British soil. The effect of these raids, particularly when coupled with his capture of the Royal Navy's {{HMS|Drake|1777|6}} – the first such success in British waters, but not Jones's last – was to force the British government to increase resources for coastal defence, and to create a climate of fear among the British public which was subsequently fed by press reports of his preparations for the 1779 ''[[USS Bonhomme Richard (1765)|Bonhomme Richard]]'' mission.

From 1776, the conflict turned increasingly into a proxy war on behalf of [[France in the American Revolutionary War|France]], following a strategy proposed in the 1760s but initially resisted by the idealistic young [[King Louis XVI]], who came to the throne at the age of 19 a few months before Lexington. France also encouraged proxy wars against the British in [[India]], but ultimately drove Great Britain to the brink of defeat by [[Anglo-French War (1778–83)|entering the war(s) directly]], on several fronts throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bicheno|first=Hugh|title=Rebels &amp; Redcoats|year=2003|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-715625-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2014}}

===American Civil War===
{{more citations needed section|date=October 2014}}
The [[American Civil War]] saw the rise of asymmetric warfare in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border States]], and in particular on the US Western Territorial Border after the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854]] opened the territories to voting on the expansion of slavery beyond the [[Missouri Compromise]] lines. Political implications of this broken 1820s compromise were nothing less than the potential expansion of slavery all across the North American continent, including the northern reaches of the [[Mexican Cession|annexed Mexican territories]] to California and Oregon. So the stakes were high and it caused a flood of immigration to the border: some to grab land and expand slavery west, others to grab land and vote down the expansion of slavery. The pro-slavery land grabbers began asymmetric violent attacks against the more pacifist abolitionists who had settled [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] and other territorial towns for suppressing slavery. [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], the abolitionist, travelled to [[Osawatomie, Kansas|Osawatomie]] in the [[Kansas Territory]] expressly to foment retaliatory attacks back against the pro-slavery guerrillas who, by 1858, had twice ransacked both Lawrence and Osawatomie (where one of Brown's sons was shot dead).

The abolitionists would not return the attacks and Brown theorized that a violent spark set off on &quot;the Border&quot; would be a way to finally ignite his long hoped-for slave rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |author=Rapley, Rob (Writer, Producer, Director) |year=2012 |network=PBS |series=The American Experience |season=24 |number=9, 10, 11 |title=The Abolitionists |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/abolitionists/player/ |transcript=Transcript |transcript-url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/abolitionists-transcript/ |access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Time needed|date=October 2014}} Brown had broad-sworded slave owners at Potawatomi Creek, so the bloody civilian violence was initially symmetrical; however, once the American Civil War ignited in 1861, and when the state of Missouri voted overwhelmingly not to secede from the Union, the pro-slavers on the MO-KS border were driven either south to Arkansas and Texas, or underground—where they became guerrilla fighters and &quot;Bushwhackers&quot; living in the brushy ravines throughout northwest Missouri across the (now) state line from Kansas. The bloody &quot;Border War&quot; lasted all during the Civil War (and long after with guerrilla partisans like the James brothers cynically robbing and murdering, aided and abetted by lingering lost-causers&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Stiles, &quot;Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War&quot;, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2014}}). Tragically the Western Border War was an asymmetric war: pro-slavery guerrillas and paramilitary partisans on the pro-Confederate side attacking pro-Union townspeople and commissioned Union military units; with the Union army trying to keep both in check: blocking Kansans and pro-Union Missourians from organizing militarily against the marauding Bushwhackers.

The worst act of domestic terror in US history came in August 1863 when paramilitary guerrillas amassed 350 strong and rode all night 50 miles across eastern Kansas to the abolitionist stronghold of Lawrence (a political target) and destroyed the town, gunning down 150 civilians. The Confederate officer whose company had joined [[Quantrill's Raiders]] that day witnessed the civilian slaughter and forbade his soldiers from joining in the carnage. The commissioned officer refused to participate in Quantrill's asymmetric warfare on civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Border War Sesquicentennial proceedings at Lawrence, Kan., August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Philippine–American War===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
The [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1902) was an armed conflict between the [[United States]] and [[Philippine Revolutionary Army|Filipino revolutionaries]]. Estimates of the Filipino forces vary between 100,000 and 1,000,000, with tens of thousands of [[auxiliaries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deady2005p55&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Deady|2005|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of weapons and ammunition was a significant impediment to the Filipinos, so most of the forces were only armed with [[Bolo knife|bolo knives]], bows and arrows, spears and other primitive weapons that, in practice, proved vastly inferior to U.S. firepower.
[[File:Philippine Revolutionary Army Rifles.jpg|thumb|Remnants of rifles used by Filipino soldiers during the War on display at Clark Museum.]]

The goal, or end-state, sought by the [[First Philippine Republic]] was a sovereign, independent, socially stable Philippines led by the ''ilustrado'' (intellectual) [[oligarchy]].&lt;ref name=Deady2005p57&gt;{{Harvnb|Deady|2005|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local chieftains, landowners, and businessmen were the ''[[principalía|principales]]'' who controlled local politics. The war was strongest when ''illustrados'', ''principales'', and peasants were unified in opposition to annexation.&lt;ref name=Deady2005p57 /&gt; The peasants, who provided the bulk of guerrilla manpower, had interests different from their ''illustrado'' leaders and the ''principales'' of their villages.&lt;ref name=Deady2005p57 /&gt; Coupled with the ethnic and geographic fragmentation, unity was a daunting task. The challenge for [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo]] and his generals was to sustain unified Filipino public opposition; this was the revolutionaries' strategic [[Center of gravity (military)|center of gravity]].&lt;ref name=Deady2005p57 /&gt; The Filipino operational center of gravity was the ability to sustain its force of 100,000 irregulars in the field.&lt;ref name=Deady2005p58&gt;{{Harvnb|Deady|2005|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Filipino general [[Francisco Macabulos]] described the Filipinos' war aim as, &quot;not to vanquish the U.S. Army but to inflict on them constant losses.&quot; They initially sought to use conventional tactics and an increasing toll of U.S. casualties to contribute to McKinley's defeat in the 1900 presidential election.&lt;ref name=Deady2005p58 /&gt; Their hope was that as president the avowedly [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] future [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of state]] [[William Jennings Bryan]] would withdraw from the Philippines.&lt;ref name=Deady2005p58 /&gt; They pursued this short-term goal with [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] better suited to a protracted struggle.&lt;ref name=Deady2005p58 /&gt; While targeting [[William McKinley|McKinley]] motivated the revolutionaries in the short term, his victory demoralized them and convinced many undecided Filipinos that the United States would not depart precipitously.&lt;ref name=Deady2005p58 /&gt; For most of 1899, the revolutionary leadership had viewed guerrilla warfare strategically only as a tactical option of final recourse, not as a means of operation which better suited their disadvantaged situation. On November 13, 1899, [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] decreed that guerrilla war would henceforth be the strategy. This made American occupation of the Philippine archipelago all the more difficult over the next few years. In fact, during just the first four months of the guerrilla war, the Americans had nearly 500 casualties. The Philippine Revolutionary Army began staging bloody ambushes and raids, such as the guerrilla victories at Paye, Catubig, Makahambus, Pulang Lupa, Balangiga and Mabitac. At first, it even seemed as if the Filipinos would fight the Americans to a stalemate and force them to withdraw. This was even considered by President McKinley at the beginning of the phase. The shift to guerrilla warfare drove the US Army to adopt counter-insurgency tactics. Civilians were given identification and forced into concentration camps with a publicly announced deadline after which all persons found outside of camps without identification would be shot on sight. Thousands of civilians died in these camps due to poor conditions.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

====Second Boer War====
Asymmetric warfare featured prominently during the [[Second Boer War]]. After an initial phase, which was fought by both sides as a conventional war, the British captured [[Johannesburg]], the Boers' largest city, and captured the capitals of the two [[Boer Republics]]. The British then expected the Boers to accept peace as dictated by the victors in the traditional European way. However instead of capitulating, the Boers fought a protracted [[guerrilla war]]. 20,000-30,000{{Ambiguous|date = January 2015}} Boer guerrillas were only defeated after the British brought to bear 450,000 troops, about ten times as many as were used in the [[Conventional warfare|conventional]] phase of the war. During this phase the British introduced [[internment]] in [[concentration camp]]s for the Boer civilian population and also implemented a [[scorched earth]] policy. Later, the British began using [[blockhouses]] built within [[machine gun]] range of one another and flanked by [[barbed wire]] to slow the Boers' movement across the countryside and block paths to valuable targets. Such tactics eventually evolved into today's [[counter insurgency]] tactics.

The Boer commando raids deep into the [[Cape Colony]], which were organized and commanded by [[Jan Smuts]], resonated throughout the century as the British adopted and adapted the tactics first used against them by the Boers.

====World War I====
* [[Lawrence of Arabia]] and British support for the [[Arab Revolt|Arab uprising]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans were the stronger power, the Arabs the weaker.
* [[Austria-Hungary]]'s [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|invasion of Serbia]], August 1914. Austria-Hungary was the stronger power, Serbia the weaker.
* [[German Empire|Germany]]'s [[German invasion of Belgium|invasion of Belgium]], August 1914. Germany was the stronger power, Belgium the weaker.

====Between the World Wars====
* [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] led resistance in [[Morocco]] from 1920 to 1924 against [[French colonial empire|French]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colonial armies ten times as strong as the guerilla force, led by General [[Philippe Pétain]].
* [[TIGR]], the first [[anti-fascist]] national-defensive organization in [[Europe]], fought against [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime in [[northeast Italy]].
* Anglo-Irish War ([[Irish War of Independence]]) fought between the Irish Republican Army and the [[Black and Tans]]/[[Auxiliaries]]. Lloyd George (British Prime Minister at the time) attempted to persuade other nations that it was not a war by refusing to use the army and using the Black and Tans instead but the conflict was conducted as an asymmetric guerrilla war and was registered as a war with the League of Nations by the Irish Free State.

====World War II====
* [[Philippine resistance against Japan]]&amp;nbsp;– During the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]] in World War II, there was an extensive Philippine resistance movement, which opposed the Japanese with active underground and guerrilla activity that increased over the years.
[[File:Molotov cocktails prepared in advance by protesters. Euromaidan Protests.jpg|thumb|Improvised [[molotov cocktail]]s]]
* [[Winter War]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Finland]] was invaded by the much larger [[mechanized military unit]]s of the [[Soviet Union]]. Although the Soviets captured 8% of Finland, they suffered enormous casualties versus much lower losses for the Finns. Soviet vehicles were confined to narrow forest roads by terrain and snow, while the Finns used [[Ski warfare|ski tactics]] around them unseen through the trees. They cut the advancing Soviet column into what they called [[Pocket (military)#Motti|motti]] (a cubic metre of firewood), and then destroyed the cut off sections one by one. Many of the Soviets were shot by snipers, had their throats cut from behind, or froze to death due to inadequate clothing and lack of camouflage and shelter. The Finns also devised a petrol bomb they called the [[Molotov cocktail]] to destroy Soviet tanks.
* [[Soviet partisans]]&amp;nbsp;– resistance movement which fought in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German occupied parts of the Soviet Union]].
* [[Warsaw Uprising]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Poland]] (Home Army, [[Armia Krajowa]]) rose up against the [[German occupation of Poland|German occupation]].
* [[German occupation of Yugoslavia|Germany's occupation of Yugoslavia]], 1941–45 (Germany vs. [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito's]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] and [[Draža Mihailović|Mihailović's]] [[Chetniks]]).

In Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam, the [[Viet Minh]], [[Viet Cong|NLF]] and other insurgencies engaged in asymmetrical guerrilla warfare with [[French Fourth Republic|France]], at first, then, later, the United States during the period of the [[Vietnam War]] (1955-1975).

====United States Irregular Warfare Annex====
In October 2019 at a Workshop at [[RAND]], Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense [[Mick Mulroy]] publicly rolled out the Irregular Warfare Annex (IWA) to the [[National Defense Strategy]] of 2018. He explained that [[irregular warfare]] included [[counter-insurgency]], [[counter-terrorism]], [[unconventional warfare]], [[foreign internal defense]], [[sabotage]] and [[subversion]], as well as stabilization and information operations. It had traditionally been perceived as a predominately counterterrorism (CT) effort used to fight violent extremist organizations, but that under the IWA the skills will be applied to all areas of military competition.  These included competition against global powers competitors like China and Russia as well as rogue states like North Korea and Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;al-monitor.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/10/pentagon-irregular-tactics-counter-iran-military.html |title = Pentagon turns to irregular tactics to counter Iran|date = 2019-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulroy said that the U.S. must be prepared to respond with &quot;aggressive, dynamic, and unorthodox approaches to IW&quot;, to be competitive across these priorities. He also explained that under the IWA, both special operations and conventional forces would play a key role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.rand.org/nsrd/news/2019/10/dasd-mulroy.html |title = NSRD Hosts Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, Michael Mulroy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;al-monitor.com&quot;/&gt;

The [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|ongoing conflict]] between [[Israel]] and some [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] organizations (such as [[Hamas]] and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]]) is a classic case of asymmetric warfare.

====Sri Lanka====
The [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], which raged on and off from 1983 to 2009, between the Sri Lankan government and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) saw large-scale asymmetric warfare. The war started as an insurgency and progressed to a large-scale conflict with the mixture of guerrilla and conventional warfare, seeing the LTTE use [[suicide bombing]] (male/female &amp; child suicide bombers) both on and off battlefield mainly targeting innocent civilians; use of explosive-filled boats for suicide attacks on military shipping; and use of light aircraft targeting military installations.

====Kashmir====

[[Pakistan]] and India claim territorial rights to [[Kashmir]], where both have engaged in proxy wars on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A brief history of the Kashmir conflict|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1399992/A-brief-history-of-the-Kashmir-conflict.html|access-date=2017-11-21|agency=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017|date=24 Sep 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory by the US-led coalition forces in the 1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], demonstrated that training, tactics and technology can provide overwhelming victories in the field of battle during modern conventional warfare. After [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime was removed from power, the Iraq campaign moved into a different type of asymmetric warfare where the coalition's use of superior conventional warfare training, tactics and technology was of much less use against continued opposition from the various partisan groups operating inside Iraq.

====Syria====
{{peacock|section|date=September 2015}}
Much of the 2012–present [[Syrian Civil War]] has been fought asymmetrically. The [[Syrian National Coalition]] along with the [[Mujahideen]] and [[Kurdish Democratic Union Party]], have been engaging with the forces of the Syrian government through asymmetric means. The conflict has seen large-scale asymmetric warfare across the country, with the forces opposed to the government unable to engage symmetrically with the Syrian government and resorting instead to other asymmetric tactics such as suicide bombings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20205432 | work=BBC News | title=Several killed in Syria car bombings | date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57475297/syrian-rebels-emboldened-after-assassinations/ | work=CBS News | title=Syrian rebels emboldened after assassinations | date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and targeted assassinations.

'''Manzanar''' is the site of [[Internment of Japanese Americans#WRA Relocation Centers|one of ten]] American [[concentration camps]],&lt;!-- Please discuss and obtain consensus on the talk page before changing terminology. Also, please see Terminiology section below. --&gt; where more than 120,000 [[Japanese Americans]] were [[Internment of Japanese Americans|incarcerated during World War II]] from March 1942 to November 1945. It is located at the foot of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains in California's [[Owens Valley]], between the towns of [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]] to the south and [[Independence, California|Independence]] to the north, approximately {{convert|230|mi|km}} north of Los Angeles. Manzanar means &quot;apple orchard&quot; in Spanish. The '''Manzanar National Historic Site''', which preserves and interprets the legacy of Japanese American incarceration in the United States, was identified by the United States [[National Park Service]] as the best-preserved of the ten former camp sites.

Since the last of those incarcerated left in 1945, former detainees and others have worked to protect Manzanar and to establish it as a [[National Historic Site (United States)|National Historic Site]] to ensure that the history of the site, along with the stories of those who were incarcerated there, is recorded for current and future generations. The primary focus is the [[Japanese American internment|Japanese American incarceration]] era, as specified in the legislation that created the Manzanar National Historic Site. The site also interprets the former town of Manzanar, the ranch days, the settlement by the [[Mono people|Owens Valley Paiute]], and the role that water played in shaping the history of the Owens Valley.

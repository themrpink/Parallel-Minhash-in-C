The King's men were forced down the hill and into Lewes where they engaged in a fighting retreat to the castle and priory.  Edward returned with his weary cavalrymen and launched a counterattack but upon locating his father was persuaded that, with the town ablaze and many of the King's supporters having fled, it was time to accept de Montfort's renewed offer of negotiations.&lt;ref name=&quot;five commanders&quot;/&gt; The Earl of Cornwall was captured by the barons when he was unable to reach the safety of the priory and, being discovered in a [[windmill]], was taunted with cries of &quot;Come down, come down, thou wicked miller.&quot;&lt;ref name=SIAS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussexias.co.uk/mills_historic_features.htm |title=THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE WINDMILL |publisher=Sussex Industrial Archaeology Society |accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The King was forced to sign the so-called [[Mise of Lewes]].  Though the document has not survived, it is clear that Henry was forced to accept the [[Provisions of Oxford]], while Prince Edward remained a hostage of the barons.&lt;ref&gt;Maddicott, pp. 272–3; Prestwich, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This put Montfort in a position of ultimate power, which would last until Prince Edward's escape, and Montfort's subsequent defeat at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in August 1265.&lt;ref name=bt/&gt; Following the battle, debts to Jews were cancelled, and the records destroyed; this had been a key war aim.&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;&lt;ref name=KJ/&gt;

In 1994, an archaeological survey of the cemetery of St Nicholas Hospital, in Lewes, revealed the remains of bodies that were thought to be combatants from the battle of Lewes.&lt;ref name=sac148&gt;Luke Barber and Lucy Siburn. The medieval hospital of St Nicholas, Lewes, East Sussex ''in'' SAC Vol. 148. pp. 79–109&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014 it was revealed that some of the skeletons may actually be much older, with a skeleton known as &quot;skeleton 180&quot; being contemporary with the Norman invasion.&lt;ref name=past6&gt;Edwina Livesay. Skeleton 180 Shock Dating Result ''in'' Sussex Past and Present Number 133. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
There remains some uncertainty over the location of the battle with Offham Hill's eastern and lower slopes covered by modern housing.  The top and southern slopes remain accessible by footpaths through agricultural land and the ruins of the priory and castle are also open to visitors.&lt;ref name=bt/&gt;

'''Link awareness''' is defined as the ability to discover, view, search and update global [[hyperlink]] information about any resource with a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] on the [[World Wide Web]].  This global link information is a shared information resource.

Implementing link awareness is difficult.  In practice, an implementation only approximates link awareness.  There are at least two qualitative axes on which we can classify these implementations.

* Breadth of coverage: The number and type of interlinked documents covered.
* Liveness: The ability (or lack thereof) to update the link information on the fly.

==Implementation examples==

* Most [[WikiWiki]] implementations support link awareness within the scope of the documents that they host.  Their breadth of coverage (insofar as link information is concerned) is ''narrow''. A wiki, however, is ''very'' live (and indeed, liveness, is its ''raison d'etre'').
* [[Google search|Google]] supports link awareness through its web interface. (You type in a query of the form &lt;code&gt;link:&amp;lt;URL&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.) Google's breadth is impressive (it covers a lot of interlinked documents), but it is a far cry from live (it can take months before Google indexes a newly created document).

'''Stanley Baldwin, 1st Earl Baldwin of Bewdley''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KG|PC|PCc|JP|FRS}} (3 August 1867{{spaced ndash}}14 December 1947)&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuart_Ball&quot;/&gt; was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] statesman who dominated the government of the [[Interwar Britain|United Kingdom between the world wars]], serving as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] on three occasions.

Born to a prosperous family in [[Bewdley]], [[Worcestershire]], Baldwin was educated at [[Hawtreys]], [[Harrow School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He joined the family iron and steel making business and entered the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in [[1908 Bewdley by-election|1908]] as the Member of Parliament for [[Bewdley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bewdley]], succeeding his father [[Alfred Baldwin (politician)|Alfred]]. He served as [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] (1917–1921) and [[President of the Board of Trade]] (1921–1922) in the [[Lloyd George ministry|coalition ministry]] of [[David Lloyd George]] and then rose rapidly: in 1922, Baldwin was one of the prime movers in the [[Carlton Club meeting|withdrawal of Conservative support]] from Lloyd George; he subsequently became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in [[Bonar Law]]'s Conservative ministry. Upon Bonar Law's resignation due to health reasons in May 1923, Baldwin became Prime Minister and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]]. He called an [[1923 United Kingdom general election|election in December 1923]] on the issue of [[Tariff Reform League|tariffs]] and lost the Conservatives' parliamentary majority, after which [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed a minority [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government.

After winning the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]], Baldwin formed his second government, which saw important tenures of office by Sir [[Austen Chamberlain]] (Foreign Secretary), [[Winston Churchill]] (at the Exchequer) and [[Neville Chamberlain]] (Health). The latter two ministers strengthened Conservative appeal by reforms in areas formerly associated with the Liberal Party. They included industrial conciliation, unemployment insurance, a more extensive old-age pension system, [[Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|slum clearance]], more private housing and expansion of maternal and childcare. However, continuing sluggish economic growth and declines in mining and heavy industry weakened Baldwin's base of support and his government also saw the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike]] in 1926 and the [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] to curb the powers of trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Williamson, &quot;The Conservative Party 1900 – 1939,&quot;  in Chris Wrigley, ed., ''A Companion to Early 20th-Century Britain'', (2003) pp 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldwin narrowly lost the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] and his continued leadership of the party was subject to extensive criticism by the press barons [[Lord Rothermere]] and [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]]. In 1931, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]] Labour Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], most of whose ministers were Conservatives, and which won an enormous majority at the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. As [[Lord President of the Council]], and one of four Conservatives among the small ten-member Cabinet, Baldwin took over many of the prime minister's duties due to MacDonald's failing health. This government saw [[Government of India Act 1935|an Act]] delivering increased self-government for India, a measure opposed by Churchill and by many rank-and-file Conservatives. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] gave [[Dominion]] status to Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, while establishing the first step towards the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. As party leader, Baldwin made many striking innovations, such as clever use of radio and film, that made him highly visible to the public and strengthened Conservative appeal.

In 1935, Baldwin officially replaced MacDonald as prime minister, and won the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] with another large majority. During this time, he oversaw the beginning of the rearmament process of the British military, as well as the [[abdication crisis of King Edward VIII]]. Baldwin's third government saw a number of crises in foreign affairs, including the public uproar over the [[Hoare–Laval Pact]], the [[remilitarisation of the Rhineland]] and the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Baldwin retired in 1937 and was succeeded by [[Neville Chamberlain]]. At that time, Baldwin was regarded as a popular and successful prime minister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/29/editorial-unthinkable-historically-accurate-films |title=Unthinkable? Historically accurate films |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for the final decade of his life and for many years afterwards he was vilified for having presided over high unemployment in the 1930s and as one of the &quot;[[Guilty Men]]&quot; who had tried to appease [[Adolf Hitler]] and who had supposedly not rearmed sufficiently to prepare for the [[Second World War]]. Today, modern scholars [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|generally rank him in the upper half]] of British prime ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul Strangio |title=Understanding Prime-Ministerial Performance: Comparative Perspectives |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kMu2nAZmMbEC&amp;pg=PA226 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford UP |isbn=978-0-19-966642-3 |pages=224, 226|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life: family, education and marriage==
Baldwin was born at Lower Park House (Lower Park, [[Bewdley]]) in [[Worcestershire]], England, to [[Alfred Baldwin (politician)|Alfred]] and [[MacDonald sisters|Louisa Baldwin]] (''née'' MacDonald), and through his Scottish mother was a first cousin of the writer and poet [[Rudyard Kipling]], with whom he was close for their entire lives. A summer spent with Rudyard and his sister with the freedom of farm and Forest at [[Loughton]] in 1877 was seminal in the development of both boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lingley&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lingley |first1=Janice |title=The Loughton Idyll |publisher=Alderton Press |isbn=9781905269341}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was prosperous, and owned the eponymous iron and steel making business that in later years became part of [[Richard Thomas and Baldwins]].

Baldwin's schools were [[Hawtreys|St Michael's School]], at the time located in [[Slough]], [[Berkshire]], followed by [[Harrow School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BLDN885S|name=Baldwin, Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that &quot;[[Humpty Dumpty|all the king's horses and all the king's men]] would have failed to have drawn me into the company of school masters, and in relation to them I once had every qualification as a passive resister.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Baldwin | first = Stanley | title = On England | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | year = 1926 | page = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin then went on to the [[University of Cambridge]], where he studied history at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. His time at university was blighted by the presence, as [[Trinity College, Cambridge#Masters|Master of Trinity]], of [[Henry Montagu Butler]], his former headmaster who had punished him at Harrow for writing a piece of schoolboy smut. He was asked to resign from the Magpie &amp; Stump (the Trinity College debating society) for never speaking, and, after receiving a [[third-class degree]] in history, he went into the family business of iron manufacturing. His father sent him to [[Mason Science College|Mason College]] for one session of technical training in [[metallurgy]] as preparation.&lt;ref&gt;K. Feiling, ''The Life of Neville Chamberlain'' (London, 1970), 11&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man he served briefly as a [[second lieutenant]] in the Artillery Volunteers at [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Middlemas and Barnes | title = Baldwin: a biography | publisher = [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]] | year = 1969 | page = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1897 became a [[justice of the peace]] for the county of Worcestershire.&lt;ref name=WWW&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Was Who, 1941–1950 | year=1952 | publisher=A and C Black | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldwin married [[Lucy Baldwin|Lucy Ridsdale]] on 12 September 1892. Following the birth of a still-born son in January 1894, the couple had six surviving children:&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuart_Ball&quot;/&gt;
* Lady Diana Lucy Baldwin (born 8 April 1895, died 1982)
* Lady Leonora Stanley Baldwin (born 10 July 1896, died 1989)
* Lady Pamela Margaret Baldwin (born 16 September 1897, died 14 August 1976)
* [[Major]] [[Oliver Baldwin, 2nd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley|Oliver Ridsdale Baldwin, 2nd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley]] (born 1 March 1899, died 10 August 1958)
* Lady Esther Louisa (Betty) Baldwin (born 16 March 1902, died 1981){{cn|date=September 2020}}
* [[Arthur Baldwin, 3rd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley|Arthur Windham Baldwin, 3rd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley]] (born 22 March 1904, died 5 July 1976)

Baldwin's youngest daughter, Lady Betty, was severely injured by shrapnel in March 1941 as a result of a [[The Blitz|bombing raid]] which destroyed the [[Café de Paris (London)|Café de Paris]] nightclub she was attending and decapitated the famous bandleader [[Ken &quot;Snakehips&quot; Johnson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Belton, Neil 1998, p.52&quot;&gt;Belton, Neil.

Baldwin proved to be adept as a businessman, and acquired a reputation as a modernising industrialist. He inherited £200,000, {{Inflation|UK|200000|1908|fmt=eq|cursign=£}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=George|first1=Robert Lloyd|title=A Modern Plutarch: Comparisons of the Greatest Western Thinkers|date=October 2016|publisher=The Overlook Press|isbn=9781468314113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isk-DQAAQBAJ&amp;q=stanley+baldwin+inheritance+200%2C000&amp;pg=PT169|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a directorship of the [[Great Western Railway]] on the death of his father in 1908.

==Early political career==
In the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]] he contested [[Kidderminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Kidderminster]] but lost amidst the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] landslide defeat after the party split on the issue of free trade. In [[1908 Bewdley by-election|a by-election in 1908]] he was elected [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Bewdley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bewdley]], in which role he succeeded his father, who had died earlier that year. During the First World War he became [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the party leader [[Bonar Law]]. In 1917 he was appointed to the junior ministerial post of [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]], where he sought to encourage voluntary donations by the rich to repay the United Kingdom's war debt, writing letters to ''[[The Times]]'' under the pseudonym 'FST', many of which were published. He relinquished to the Treasury one fifth of his own fortune (its total estimated at own account as £580,000) held in the form of [[War Loan]] stock worth £120,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuart_Ball&quot;&gt;{{cite odnb|last= Ball |first = Stuart | title = Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867–1947)&quot; | id = 30550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joins Cabinet===

Although he entered politics at a relatively late age, his rise to the top leadership was very rapid. In the Treasury he served jointly with [[Hardman Lever|Sir Hardman Lever]], who had been appointed in 1916, but after 1919 Baldwin carried out the duties largely alone. He was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in the 1920 Birthday Honours. In 1921 he was promoted to [[Conservative government 1922–24|the Cabinet]] as [[President of the Board of Trade]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===
In late 1922 dissatisfaction was steadily growing within the Conservative Party over its coalition with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[David Lloyd George]]. At a [[Carlton Club meeting, 19 October 1922|meeting of Conservative MPs]] at the [[Carlton Club]] in October, Baldwin announced that he would no longer support the coalition, and famously condemned Lloyd George for being a &quot;dynamic force&quot; that was bringing destruction across politics. The meeting chose to leave the coalition, against the wishes of most of the party leadership. As a direct result Bonar Law was forced to search for new ministers for a Cabinet which he would lead, and so promoted Baldwin to the position of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. In the November [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] the Conservatives were returned with a majority in their own right.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

In May 1923 Bonar Law was diagnosed with terminal cancer and retired immediately; he died five months later. With many of the party's senior leading figures standing aloof and outside of the government, there were only two candidates to succeed him: [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], the [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], and Baldwin. The choice formally fell to [[George V|King George V]] acting on the advice of senior ministers and officials.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

It is not entirely clear what factors proved most crucial, but some Conservative politicians felt that Curzon was unsuitable for the role of prime minister because he was a member of the [[House of Lords]]. Curzon was strong and experienced in international affairs, but his lack of experience in domestic affairs, his personal character quirks and his huge inherited wealth and many directorships at a time when the Conservative Party was seeking to shed its patrician image were all deemed impediments. Much weight at the time was given to the intervention of [[Arthur Balfour]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The King turned to Baldwin to become prime minister. Initially Baldwin was also [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] whilst he sought to recruit the former Liberal Chancellor [[Reginald McKenna]] to join the government. When this failed he appointed [[Neville Chamberlain]] to that position.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The Conservatives now had a clear majority in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and could govern for five years before holding a general election, but Baldwin felt bound by Bonar Law's pledge at the previous election that there would be no introduction of tariffs without a further election. Thus Baldwin turned towards a degree of [[protectionism]] which would remain a key party message during his lifetime.&lt;ref name=mc&gt;Maurice Cowling, ''The Impact of Labour. 1920–1924. The Beginnings of Modern British Politics'' (Cambridge University Press, 1971), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; With the country facing growing unemployment in the wake of free trade imports driving down prices and profits, Baldwin decided to call an early general election in [[1923 United Kingdom general election|December 1923]] to seek a mandate to introduce protectionist tariffs which, he hoped, would drive down unemployment and spur an economic recovery.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; He expected to unite his party but he divided it, for protectionism proved a divisive issue.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Smart, &quot;Baldwin's Blunder? The General Election of 1923.&quot; ''Twentieth Century British History'' 7#1 (1996): 110–139.&lt;/ref&gt;  The election was inconclusive: the Conservatives had 258 MPs, Labour 191 and the reunited Liberals 159. Whilst the Conservatives retained a plurality in the House of Commons, they had been clearly defeated on the central issue: tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Self | first1 = Robert | year = 1992 | title = Conservative reunion and the general election of 1923: a reassessment | journal = Twentieth Century British History | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 249–273 | doi=10.1093/tcbh/3.3.249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin remained prime minister until the opening of the new Parliament in January 1924, when his administration was defeated in a vote on its legislative programme set out in the [[State Opening of Parliament|King's Speech]]. He offered his resignation to [[George V]] immediately.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

==Leader of the Opposition (1924)==
Baldwin successfully held on to the party leadership amid some colleagues' calls for his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Cowling, ''The Impact of Labour'', p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next ten months, an unstable minority Labour government under Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] held office. On 13 March 1924, the Labour government was defeated for the first time in the Commons, although the Conservatives decided to vote with Labour later that day against the Liberals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowling1&quot;&gt;Cowling, ''The Impact of Labour'', p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a debate on the naval estimates the Conservatives opposed Labour but supported them on 18 March in a vote on cutting expenditure on the Singapore military base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowling1&quot;/&gt; Baldwin also cooperated with MacDonald over Irish policy to stop it becoming a party-political issue.&lt;ref&gt;Cowling, ''The Impact of Labour'', p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Middlemas and John Barnes, ''Baldwin: A Biography'' (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1969), pp. 269–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Labour government was negotiating with the Soviet government over intended commercial treaties – 'the Russian Treaties' – to provide [[most favoured nation]] privileges and diplomatic status for the UK trade delegation; and a treaty that would settle the claims of pre-revolutionary British bondholders and holders of confiscated property, after which the British government would guarantee a loan to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas and Barnes, pp. 271–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin decided to vote against the government over the Russian Treaties, which brought the government down on 8 October.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas and Barnes, pp. 273–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1924 United Kingdom general election|general election]] held in October 1924 brought a landslide majority of 223 for the Conservative party, primarily at the expense of an unpopular [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Baldwin campaigned on the &quot;impracticability&quot; of socialism, the [[Campbell Case]], the [[Zinoviev letter]] (which Baldwin thought was genuine, and the Conservatives leaked to the ''Daily Mail'' at a most damaging time to the Labour campaign; the letter is now widely believed to have been a forgery&lt;ref&gt;''The Hidden Hand'', BBC Parliament, 4 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) and the Russian Treaties.&lt;ref&gt;Cowling, ''The Impact of Labour'', pp. 408–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech during the campaign Baldwin said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It makes my blood boil to read of the way which Mr. Zinoviev is speaking of the Prime Minister today. Though one time there went up a cry, &quot;Hands off Russia&quot;, I think it's time somebody said to Russia, &quot;Hands off England&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas and Barnes, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Baldwin's new Cabinet now included many former political associates of Lloyd George: former Coalition Conservatives: [[Austen Chamberlain]] (as Foreign Secretary), [[F E Smith|Lord Birkenhead]] (Secretary for India) and Arthur Balfour (Lord President after 1925), and the former Liberal [[Winston Churchill]] as Chancellor of the Exchequer. This period included the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, a crisis that the government managed to weather, despite the havoc it caused throughout the UK. Baldwin created the [[Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies]], a volunteer body of those opposed to the strike which was intended to complete essential work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj70/bookwatc.htm |title=Bookwatch: The General Strike |publisher=Pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk |access-date=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Baldwin's instigation [[William Weir, 1st Viscount Weir|Lord Weir]] headed a [[committee]] to &quot;review the national problem of electrical energy&quot;. It published its report on 14 May 1925 and in it Weir recommended the setting up of a [[Central Electricity Board]], a state monopoly half-financed by the [[British Government|Government]] and half by local undertakings. Baldwin accepted Weir's recommendations and they became law by the end of 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middlemas and Barnes, pp. 393–4&quot;&gt;Middlemas and Barnes, pp. 393–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board was a success. By 1939 electrical output was up fourfold and generating costs had fallen. Consumers of electricity rose from three-quarters of a million in 1920 to nine million in 1938, with annual growth of 700,000 to 800,000 a year (the fastest rate of growth in the world).&lt;ref name=&quot;Middlemas and Barnes, pp. 393–4&quot;/&gt;

One of his legislative reforms was a paradigm shift in his party. This was the Widows, Orphans and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act of 1925, which provided a pension of 10 shillings a week for widows with extra for children, and 10 shillings a week for insured workers and their wives at 65. This transformed [[Toryism]], away from its historic reliance on community (particularly religious) charities, and towards acceptance of a humanitarian [[welfare state]] which would guarantee a minimum living standard for those unable to work or who took out [[national insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mastering Modern World History'' Norman Lowe, 2nd edition (and later eds.), 1966, Macmillan {{ISBN|9780333465769}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, he was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=12 November 2020|title=Search past Fellows|url=https://catalogues.royalsociety.org/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Persons&amp;id=NA8113&amp;pos=1|access-date=12 November 2020|website=The Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leader of the Opposition (1929–1931)==
In [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]] Labour returned to office as the largest party in the House of Commons (although without an overall majority) despite obtaining fewer votes than the Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williamson | first1 = Philip | year = 1982 | title = 'Safety First': Baldwin, the Conservative Party and the 1929 General Election | url = http://dro.dur.ac.uk/10557/1/10557.pdf| journal = Historical Journal | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 385–409 | doi=10.1017/s0018246x00011614}}&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition, Baldwin was almost ousted as party leader by the [[press baron]]s Lords Rothermere and Beaverbrook, whom he accused of enjoying &quot;power without responsibility, the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. Rubinstein|title=Twentieth-Century Britain: A Political History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdRixcpqvDwC&amp;pg=PA176|year=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=176|isbn=9780333772249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsden argues that Baldwin made dramatic permanent improvements to the organisation and effectiveness of the Conservative Party. He enlarged the headquarters with professionals, professionalised the party agents, raised ample funds, and was an innovative user of the new mass media of radio and film.&lt;ref&gt;John Ramsden, ''The Age of Balfour and Baldwin, 1902–1940'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lord President of the Council (1931–1935)==
By 1931, as the economy headed towards crisis, both in Britain and around the world, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], Baldwin and the Conservatives entered into a coalition with Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Williamson,  &quot;1931 Revisited: The Political Realities.&quot; ''Twentieth Century British History'' 2#3 (1991): 328–338.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision led to MacDonald's expulsion from his own party, and Baldwin, as [[Lord President of the Council]], became ''[[de facto]]'' prime minister, deputising for the increasingly senile MacDonald, until he once again officially became prime minister in 1935.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

One central and vitally important agreement was the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which conferred full self-government upon the Dominions [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], while preparing the first steps towards the eventual [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and away from the designation 'British Empire'.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1973&quot;&gt;''Baldwin: The Unexpected Prime Minister'', by [[Montgomery Hyde]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the first [[British Empire Games]] sports competition was held successfully among Empire nations in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

His government then secured with great difficulty the passage of the landmark [[Government of India Act 1935]], in the teeth of opposition from Winston Churchill, spokesman for the die-hard imperialists who filled the Conservative ranks.&lt;ref&gt;N. C. Fleming, &quot;Diehard Conservatism, Mass Democracy, and Indian Constitutional Reform, c. 1918–35.&quot; ''Parliamentary History'' 32#2 (2013): 337–360.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disarmament===
Baldwin did not advocate total disarmament but believed that, as Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] had stated in 1925, &quot;great armaments lead inevitably to war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas and Barnes, p. 722.&lt;/ref&gt; However he came to believe that, as he put it on 10 November 1932: &quot;the time has now come to an end when Great Britain can proceed with unilateral disarmament&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middlemas1&quot;&gt;Middlemas and Barnes, p. 735.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 November 1932 Baldwin said:

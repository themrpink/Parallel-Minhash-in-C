The [[Ancient Near East]] is considered the [[cradle of civilization]]. It was the first to practice intensive year-round [[agriculture]]; created the first [[history of writing|coherent writing system]], invented the [[potter's wheel]] and then the vehicular- and mill [[wheel]], created the first [[centralized government]]s, [[law code]]s and [[empire]]s, as well as introducing [[social stratification]], [[slavery]] and organized [[warfare]], and it laid the foundation for the fields of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]].

====Mesopotamia====
{{further|Mesopotamia|History of Iraq}}

[[Mesopotamia]] is the site of some of the earliest known [[civilization]]s in the world. Early settlement of the alluvial plain lasted from the [[Ubaid period]] (late 6th millennium BC) through the [[Uruk period]] (4th millennium BC) and the Dynastic periods (3rd millennium BC) until the rise of [[Babylon]] in the early 2nd millennium BC. The surplus of storable foodstuffs created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating after crops and herds. It also allowed for a much greater population density, and in turn required an extensive labor force and [[division of labor]]. This organization led to the necessity of record keeping and the development of [[history of writing|writing]] (c. 3500 BC).

[[Babylonia]] was an [[Amorite]] state in lower [[Mesopotamia]] (modern southern [[Iraq]]), with Babylon as its capital. Babylonia emerged when [[Hammurabi]] (fl. c. 1728–1686 BC, according to the [[short chronology]]) created an empire out of the territories of the former kingdoms of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. The Amorites being [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]], Babylonia adopted the written [[Akkadian language]] for official use; they retained the [[Sumerian language]] for religious use, which by that time was no longer a spoken language. The Akkadian and Sumerian cultures played a major role in later Babylonian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under outside rule. The earliest mention of the city of [[Babylon]] can be found in a tablet from the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]], dating back to the 23rd century BC.

The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], or [[Chaldea]], was Babylonia under the rule of the 11th (&quot;Chaldean&quot;) dynasty, from the revolt of [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC until the invasion of [[Cyrus the Great]] in 539 BC. Notably, it included the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], who conquered the [[Kingdom of Judah]] and [[Jerusalem]].

Akkad was a city and its surrounding region in central Mesopotamia. Akkad also became the capital of the [[Akkadian Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WebsterNinthNewCollege&quot;&gt;Mish, Frederick C., Editor in Chief. &quot;Akkad.&quot; ''[[Webster's Dictionary#The Collegiate Dictionary|Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary]]''. 9th ed. Springfield, MA: [[Merriam-Webster]] Inc., 1985. {{ISBN|978-0-87779-508-7|978-0-87779-509-4}} (indexed), and {{ISBN|978-0-87779-510-0}} (deluxe).&lt;/ref&gt; The city was probably situated on the west bank of the [[Euphrates]], between [[Sippar]] and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] (in present-day Iraq, about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the center of [[Baghdad]]). Despite an extensive search, the precise site has never been found. Akkad reached the height of its power between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC, following the conquests of king Sargon of Akkad. Because of the policies of the Akkadian Empire toward linguistic assimilation, Akkad also gave its name to the predominant Semitic dialect: the Akkadian language, reflecting use of ''akkadû'' (&quot;in the language of Akkad&quot;) in the Old Babylonian period to denote the Semitic version of a Sumerian text.

[[Assyria]] was originally (in the [[Middle Bronze Age]]) a region on the Upper [[Tigris]], named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Assur]]. Later, as a nation and empire that came to control all of the [[Fertile Crescent]], [[Egypt]] and much of [[Anatolia]], the term &quot;Assyria proper&quot; referred to roughly the northern half of Mesopotamia (the southern half being Babylonia), with [[Nineveh]] as its capital. The Assyrian kings controlled a large kingdom at three different times in history. These are called the ''Old'' (20th to 15th centuries BC), ''Middle'' (15th to 10th centuries BC), and ''[[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]]'' (911–612 BC) kingdoms, or periods, of which the last is the most well known and best documented. Assyrians invented [[sapping|excavation to undermine]] [[fortification|city walls]], [[battering ram]]s to knock down gates, as well as the concept of a corps of [[engineers]], who bridged rivers with pontoons or provided soldiers with inflatable skins for swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mitanni]] was an Indo-Iranian&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/385882/Mitanni Mitanni].&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 9 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; empire in northern Mesopotamia from c. 1500 BC. At the height of Mitanni power, during the 14th century BC, it encompassed what is today southeastern [[Turkey]], northern [[Syria]] and northern Iraq, centered around its capital, [[Washukanni]], whose precise location has not been determined by archaeologists.

Its culture played a crucial role in the [[Gutian Empire]], especially during the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] that succeeded it, when the [[Elamite language]] remained among those in official use. The Elamite period is considered a starting point for the [[history of Iran]].
The [[Medes]] were an [[Ancient Iranian peoples|ancient Iranian people]]. They had established their own empire by the 6th century BC, having defeated the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] with the [[Chaldea]]ns. They overthrew [[Urartu]] later on as well. The Medes are credited with the foundation of the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until [[Cyrus the Great]] established a unified Iranian empire of the Medes and [[Persian people|Persian]], often referred to as the [[Achaemenid Empire]], by defeating his grandfather and overlord, [[Astyages]] the king of Media.[[File:Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent according to Oxford Atlas of World History 2002.jpg|thumb|533x533px|The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]] at its greatest extent, c. 500 BC|alt=|center]]The [[Achaemenid Empire]] was the largest and most significant of the [[Persian Empire]]s, and followed the [[Median Empire]] as the second great empire of the Iranians. It is noted in western history as the foe of the [[Greek city states]] in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], for freeing the [[Israelites]] from their [[Babylonian captivity]], for its successful model of a centralized bureaucratic administration, the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]), and for instituting [[Aramaic]] as the empire's [[official language]]. Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, Persian influence upon the language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law and government of nations around the world lasts to this day. At the height of its power, the Achaemenid dynasty encompassed approximately 8.0&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers, held the greatest percentage of world population to date, stretched three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa) and was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.

The [[Parthia]]n Empire (mostly [[Western Iranian languages|Western Iranian]]) is shown in red, other areas, dominated by [[Scythia]] (mostly [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]]), in orange.|alt=|center|frame]]

[[Parthia]] was an Iranian civilization situated in the northeastern part of modern Iran. Their power was based on a combination of the guerrilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe, with organizational skills to build and administer a vast empire – even though it never matched in power and extent the Persian empires that preceded and followed it. The [[Parthian Empire]] was led by the Arsacid dynasty, which reunited and ruled over significant portions of the [[Near East]] and beyond, after defeating and disposing the Hellenistic [[Seleucid Empire]], beginning in the late 3rd century BC. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the [[Medes|Median]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] dynasties). Parthia had many wars with the [[Roman Republic]] (and subsequently the [[Roman Empire]]), which marked the start of what would be over 700 years of frequent [[Roman-Persian Wars]].

The [[Sassanid Empire]], lasting the length of the [[Late Antiquity]] period, is considered to be one of Iran's most important and influential historical periods. In many ways the Sassanid period witnessed the highest achievements of [[Persian culture|Persian civilization]] and constituted the last great Iranian Empire before the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Muslim conquest]] and the adoption of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Hourani, Albert (1991), A History of the Arab Peoples, London: Faber and Faber. {{ISBN|978-0-571-22664-1}}. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; During Sassanid times, Persia influenced Roman civilization considerably,&lt;ref&gt;Bury, J.B.

====Armenia====
{{Main|History of Armenia}}
[[File:Maps of the Armenian Empire of Tigranes.gif|thumb|Largest expansion of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] under [[Tigranes the Great]]]]
The early history of the [[Hittite empire]] is known through tablets that may first have been written in the 17th century BC but survived only as copies made in the 14th and 13th centuries BC. These tablets, known collectively as the [[Anitta]] text,&lt;ref&gt;ed. [[StBoT]] 18&lt;/ref&gt; begin by telling how [[Pithana]] the king of [[Kussara]] or Kussar (a small [[city-state]] yet to be identified by archaeologists) conquered the neighbouring city of [[Neša]] ([[Kanesh]]). However, the real subject of these tablets is [[Pithana]]'s son [[Anitta]], who conquered several neighbouring cities, including [[Hattusa]] and [[Zalpuwa]] ([[Zalpa]]).

Assyrian inscriptions of [[Shalmaneser I]] (c. 1270 BC) first mention ''[[Urartu|Uruartri]]'' as one of the states of [[Nairi (people)|Nairi]] – a loose confederation of small kingdoms and tribal states in the [[Armenian Highland]] from the 13th to 11th centuries BC. Uruartri itself was in the region around [[Lake Van]]. The Nairi states were repeatedly subjected to attacks by the Assyrians, especially under Tukulti-Ninurta I (c. 1240 BC), [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (c. 1100 BC), Ashur-bel-kala (c. 1070 BC), [[Adad-nirari II]] (c. 900), [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (c. 890), and [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883–859 BC).

The [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] was an independent kingdom from 321 BC to 428 AD, and a client state of the Roman and Persian empires until 428. Between 95 and 55 BC under the rule of [[Tigranes the Great|King Tigranes the Great]], the kingdom of Armenia became a large and powerful empire stretching from the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]s. During this short time it was considered to be the most powerful state in the Roman East.&lt;ref&gt;''Time Almanac'', p. 724 by Editors of Time Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Review''. p. 208 edited by Archibald Grove, William Ernest Henley&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====

{{Main|History of Ancient Israel and Judah}}
[[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] were related Iron Age kingdoms of the ancient Levant and had existed during the Iron Ages and the Neo-Babylonian, Persian and Hellenistic periods.

Israel had emerged by the middle of the 9th century BC, when the Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser III]] names &quot;[[Ahab]] the Israelite&quot; among his enemies at the [[battle of Qarqar]] (853). Judah emerged somewhat later than Israel, probably during the 9th century BC, but the subject is one of considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Grabbe|editor-first=Lester L.|title=Israel in Transition: From Late Bronze II to Iron IIa (c. 1250–850 B.C.E.)|publisher=T&amp;T Clark International|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tR0Qpz2zRogC|isbn=978-0-567-02726-9|pages=225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding [[neo-Assyrian empire]], which first split its territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital, Samaria (722). A series of campaigns by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] between 597 and 582 led to the destruction of Judah.

Followed by the fall of Babylon to the [[Persian empire]], Jews were allowed, by [[Cyrus the Great]], to [[Return to Zion|return to Judea]]. The [[Hasmonean Kingdom]] (followed by the [[Maccabean revolt]]) had existed during the Hellenistic period and then the [[Herodian kingdom]] during the Roman period.

====Others====
{{Main|Pre-Islamic Arabia|Ancient history of Yemen}}

The history of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] before the rise of [[Islam]] in the 630s is not known in great detail. Archaeological exploration in the [[Arabian peninsula]] has been sparse; indigenous written sources are limited to the many inscriptions and coins from southern Arabia. Existing material consists primarily of written sources from other traditions (such as [[Egypt]]ians, [[Greece|Greeks]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], etc.) and [[oral tradition]]s later recorded by Islamic scholars. Many small kingdoms prospered from Red sea and [[Indian Ocean trade]]. Major kingdoms included the [[Sabaeans]], [[Kingdom of Awsan|Awsan]], [[Lakhmids|Lahkimid]] [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyar]] and the [[Nabataeans|Nabateans]]. Arab kingdoms are occasionally mentioned in the Hebrew [[Old Testament]] under the name of [[Edom]].
Though the [[Ugarit]]ic site is thought to have been inhabited earlier, [[Neolithic]] Ugarit was already important enough to be fortified with a wall early on. The first written evidence mentioning the city comes from the nearby city of [[Ebla]], c. 1800 BC. [[Ugarit]] passed into the sphere of influence of Egypt, which deeply influenced its art. On the Mediterranean coast of modern-day Israel, Palestine and Lebanon, Canaanite peoples became wealth through trade inspiring Phoenicians.

[[Phoenicia]] was an ancient civilization centered in the north of ancient [[Canaan]], with its heartland along the coastal regions of modern-day [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Israel]]. Phoenician civilization was an enterprising [[thalassocracy|maritime trading culture]] that spread across the [[Mediterranean]] between the period of 1550 to 300 BC. One Phoenician colony, [[Carthage]], became a powerful nation in its own right.

==== Carthage ====

{{Main|Carthage}}
[[Carthage]] was founded in 814 BC by [[Phoenicia]]n settlers from the city of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], bringing with them the [[tutelary deity|city-god]] [[Melqart]].&lt;ref&gt;As recounted by Timaeus, FrGrH 566, fr. 60. Archaeological attestation for so early a date is still wanting, though recent discoveries in situ may point nearly as far back in time.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Carthage]] was an informal [[hegemony]] of [[Phoenicia]]n [[city-state]]s throughout North Africa and modern [[Spain]] from 575 BC until 146 BC. It was more or less under the control of the city-state of [[Carthage]] after the fall of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] to [[Babylonia]]n forces. At the height of the city's influence, its empire included most of the western Mediterranean. The empire was in a constant state of struggle with the [[Roman Republic]], which led to a series of conflicts known as the [[Punic Wars]]. After the third and [[Third Punic War|final Punic War]], Carthage was destroyed then occupied by Roman forces. Nearly all of the territory held by Carthage fell into Roman hands.

==== Egypt ====
{{Main|Ancient Egypt|Outline of ancient Egypt}}

[[File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Khafre's Pyramid]] ([[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]]) and [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] (c. 2500 BC or perhaps earlier)|alt=|left]] [[Ancient Egypt]] was a long-lived [[civilization]] geographically located in north-eastern [[Africa]]. It was concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the [[Nile River]] reaching its greatest extension during the 2nd millennium [[Before Christ|BC]], which is referred to as the [[New Kingdom]] period. It reached broadly from the [[Nile Delta]] in the north, as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]] at the [[Fourth Cataract]] of the Nile. Extensions to the geographical range of ancient Egyptian civilization included, at different times, areas of the southern [[Levant]], the Eastern Desert and the [[Red Sea]] coastline, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] (focused on the several [[oasis|oases]]).

Ancient Egypt developed over at least three and a half [[millennia]]. It began with the incipient unification of Nile Valley polities around 3500 BC and is conventionally thought to have ended in 30 BC when the early [[Roman Empire]] conquered and absorbed [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] as a province. (Though this last did not represent the first period of foreign domination, the Roman period was to witness a marked, if gradual transformation in the political and religious life of the Nile Valley, effectively marking the termination of independent civilisational development).

The civilization of ancient Egypt was based on a finely balanced control of natural and human resources, characterised primarily by controlled [[irrigation]] of the fertile Nile Valley; the mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions; the early development of an independent [[writing|writing system]] and [[literature]]; the organisation of collective projects; [[trade]] with surrounding regions in east / central Africa and the eastern [[Mediterranean]]; finally, [[military]] ventures that exhibited strong characteristics of imperial hegemony and territorial domination of neighbouring cultures at different periods. Motivating and organizing these activities were a socio-political and economic [[elite]] that achieved social consensus by means of an elaborate system of [[religion|religious belief]] under the figure of a (semi)-divine ruler (usually male) from a succession of ruling [[dynasty|dynasties]] and which related to the larger world by means of [[polytheism|polytheistic beliefs]].

==== Nubia ====
[[File:Rulers of Kush, Kerma Museum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pharaoh]]s of Nubia]]

The [[Kushite]] civilization, which is also known as Nubia, was formed before a period of Egyptian incursion into the area. The first cultures arose in what is now [[Sudan]] before the time of a unified [[Egypt]], and the most widespread culture is known as the [[Kerma culture|Kerma civilization]]. Egyptians referred to Nubia as &quot;Ta-Seti,&quot; or &quot;The Land of the Bow,&quot; since the Nubians were known to be expert archers. The two civilization shared an abundance of peaceful cultural interchange and cooperation, including mixed marriages and even the same gods. In the New Kingdom, Nubians became indistinguishable in the archaeological record from Egyptians. The Kingdom of Kush survived longer than that of Egypt and at its greatest extent Nubia ruled over Egypt (under the leadership of king [[Piye]]), and controlled Egypt during the 8th century BC as the [[Kushite Empire|25th Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientsudan.org/history_06_nubconegypt.htm|title=Ancient Sudan~ Nubia: History: The Kushite Conquest of Egypt|work=ancientsudan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also referred to as [[Aethiopia|Ethiopia]] in ancient Greek and Roman records. According to Josephus and other classical writers, the Kushite Empire covered all of Africa, and some parts of Asia and Europe at one time or another. In contrast to the Egyptians the Nubians had an unusually high number of ruling queens also known as [[Kandake]], especially during the golden age of the Meroitic Kingdom. Unlike the rest of the world at the time, women in Nubia exercised significant control in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kneller |first=Tara L. |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Role_Women.html |title=Role of Women in Nubia [Kneller] |website=africa.upenn.edu |access-date=2018-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915201333/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Role_Women.html |archive-date=2018-09-15 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kushites are also famous for having buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves. The Kushites also built burial mounds and pyramids, and shared some of the same gods worshipped in Egypt, especially [[Amun|Amon]] and [[Isis]].[[File:Relief of Hatshepsut's expedition to the Land of Punt by Σταύρος.jpg|thumb|Egyptian soldiers from Hatshepsut's expedition to the Land of Punt as depicted from her temple at [[Deir el-Bahri]].|alt=|left]]

==== Land of Punt ====

{{Main|Land of Punt}}The Land of Punt, also called [[Pwenet]] or Pwene&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw &amp; Nicholson, p.231&quot;&gt;Ian Shaw &amp; Paul Nicholson, The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, British Museum Press, London. 1995, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, was a trading partner known for producing and exporting gold, aromatic resins, [[African Blackwood|African blackwood]], [[ebony]], [[ivory]], slaves and wild animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw &amp; Nicholson, p.231&quot; /&gt; Information about Punt has been found in ancient [[Egypt]]ian records of trade missions to this region.
The exact [[Land of Punt#Location|location]] of Punt remains a mystery. The mainstream view is that Punt was located to the south-east of Egypt, most likely on the coast of the [[Horn of Africa]]. Archaeologist [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)]] states;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[Punt] has been identified with territory on both the Arabian and the Horn of Africa coasts. Consideration of the articles that the Egyptians obtained from Punt, notably gold and ivory, suggests, however, that these were primarily of African origin. ... This leads us to suppose that the term Punt probably applied more to African than Arabian territory.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw &amp; Nicholson, p.231&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyldesley&quot;&gt;Tyldesley, Hatchepsut, p.147&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Pankhurst|first1=Richard|year=2001|title=The Ethiopians: A history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcpQqkHr328C|isbn=978-0-631-22493-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAnTJQWWnoAC|title=Frederick Monderson|date=2007-09-01|isbn=978-1-4259-6644-7|last1=Monderson|first1=Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The earliest recorded Egyptian expedition to Punt was organized by [[Pharaoh]] [[Sahure]] of the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] (25th century BC) although gold from Punt is recorded as having been in Egypt in the time of king Khufu of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Breasted|1906–07|p=161|Ref=none}}, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, there were more expeditions to Punt in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt]], the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt]], the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt]] and the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]].

The Axumite Empire was an important trading nation in northeastern [[Africa]] centered in present-day [[Eritrea]] and northern [[Ethiopia]], it existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the Iron Age proto-Aksumite period c. fourth century BC to achieve prominence by the first century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=xeJMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology|author=Phillipson, David|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Neil Asher Silberman|page=48|isbn=978-0-19-973578-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Book of Aksum, Aksum's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAIAAJ|title=Africa Geoscience Review|year=2003|publisher=Rock View International|page=366|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital was later moved to Axum in northern Ethiopia. The Kingdom used the name &quot;Ethiopia&quot; as early as the fourth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Munro-Hay57&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul B. Henze 2005&quot;&gt;Henze, Paul B.

The Empire of Aksum at its height at its climax by the early sixth century extended through much of modern Ethiopia and across the Red Sea to Arabia.  The capital city of the empire was [[Axum|Aksum]], now in northern Ethiopia.

Its ancient capital is found in northern Ethiopia, the Kingdom used the name &quot;Ethiopia&quot; as early as the 4th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Munro-Hay57&quot;&gt;Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity.

Henze, ''Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Aksum is mentioned in the 1st century AD ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' as an important market place for ivory, which was exported throughout the ancient world, and states that the ruler of Aksum in the 1st century AD was [[Zoscales]], who, besides ruling in Aksum also controlled two harbours on the [[Red Sea]]: [[Adulis]] (near [[Massawa]]) and Avalites ([[Assab]]). He is also said to have been familiar with Greek literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html ''Periplus of the Erythreaean Sea''], chs. 4, 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an alleged resting place of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and home of the [[Queen of Sheba]]. Aksum was also one of the first major empires to convert to [[Christianity]].

[[Macrobia]] was an ancient kingdom situated in the Horn of Africa (present day Somalia) it is mentioned in the 5th century BC. According to Herodotus' account, the [[Persian Emperor]] [[Cambyses II]] upon his [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|conquest of Egypt]] (525 BC) sent ambassadors to Macrobia, bringing luxury gifts for the Macrobian king  to entice his submission. The Macrobian ruler, who was elected based at least in part on stature, replied instead with a challenge for his  Persian counterpart in the form of an unstrung [[Bow and arrow|bow]]: if the Persians could manage to string it, they would have the right to invade his country; but until then, they should thank the gods that the Macrobians never decided to invade their empire .&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler pg 526&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Kitto2&quot;&gt;John Kitto, James Taylor, ''The popular cyclopædia of Biblical literature: condensed from the larger work'', (Gould and Lincoln: 1856), p.302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=White|first=John S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PuFRDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Macrobians+unstrung+bow&amp;pg=PA115|title=The Boys ́ and Girls ́ Herodotus|date=2018-04-05|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|isbn=978-3-7326-5420-8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Macrobians]] were a regional power reputed for their advanced architecture and gold wealth, which was so plentiful that they shackled their prisoners in golden chains.&lt;ref&gt;John Kitto, James Taylor, The popular cyclopædia of Biblical literature: condensed from the larger work, (Gould and Lincoln: 1856), p.302..&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of Macrobia, several wealthy ancient city-states, such as [[Opone]], [[Essina]], [[Sarapion]], [[Nikon (Somalia)|Nikon]], [[Malao (ancient)|Malao]], [[Damo, Somalia|Damo]] and [[Mosylon]] near [[Cape Guardafui]] would emerge from the 1st millennium BC–500 AD to compete with the [[Sabaeans]], [[Parthia]]ns and [[Aksumite Empire|Axumites]] for the wealthy [[South Asia|Indo]]-[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] trade and flourished along the Somali coast. They developed a lucrative trading network under a region collectively known in the Peripilus of the Erythraean Sea as [[Barbaria (East Africa)|Barbaria]] &lt;ref&gt;Oman in history By Peter Vine Page 324&lt;/ref&gt;

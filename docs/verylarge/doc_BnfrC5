==== The cathedral ====

===== Medieval =====
[[Polyphony|Polyphonic music]] written for the monks of Christ Church Priory (the cathedral) survives from the 13th century. The cathedral may have had an [[Organ (music)|organ]] as early as the 12th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers&quot;&gt;Roger Bowers, 'The Liturgy of the Cathedral and its music, c. 1075–1642', In: ''A History of Canterbury Cathedral'', ed. P. Collinson, N. Ramsay, M. Sparks. (OUP 1995, revised edition 2002), pp. 408–450.&lt;/ref&gt; though the names of organists are only recorded from the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Canterbury Cathedral#Organs and organists|Canterbury Cathedral: organs and organists]].&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the earliest named composers associated with Canterbury Cathedral was [[Leonel Power]], who was appointed master of the new Lady Chapel choir formed in 1438.

===== Post-Reformation =====
The Reformation brought a period of decline in the cathedral's music which was revived under Dean [[Thomas Nevile|Thomas Neville]] in the early 17th century. Neville introduced instrumentalists into the cathedral's music who played [[cornett]] and [[sackbut]], probably members of the city's band of waits. The cathedral acquired sets of [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], [[lute]]s and [[viol]]s for the use of the choir boys and lay-clerks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers&quot; /&gt;

==== The city ====

===== Early modern =====
As was common in English cities in the Middle Ages, Canterbury employed a town band known as the [[Wait (musician)|Waits]]. There are records of payments to the Waits starting from 1402, though they probably existed earlier than this. The Waits were disbanded by the city authorities in 1641 for 'misdemeanors' but were reinstated in 1660 when they played for the visit of King Charles II on his return from exile.&lt;ref&gt;James M. Gibson, 'The Canterbury Waits', in: ''Records of Early English Drama. Kent: Diocese of Canterbury''. University of Toronto Press and The British Library, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Waits were eventually abolished nationally by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835|Municipal Corporations Act of 1835]]. A modern early music group called The Canterbury Waits has revived the name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://themusickcabinet.co.uk/Canterbury_Waits.aspx The Canterbury Waits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207022656/http://themusickcabinet.co.uk/Canterbury_Waits.aspx |date=7 February 2009 }}.

The Canterbury Catch Club was a musical and social club which met in the city between 1779 and 1865. The club (male only) met weekly in the winter. It employed an orchestra to assist in performances in the first half of the evening. After the interval, the members sang [[Catch (music)|catches]] and [[glees]] from the club's extensive music library (now deposited at the Cathedral Archives in Canterbury).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/history/libraries.aspx Canterbury Cathedral Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914211157/http://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/history/libraries.aspx |date=14 September 2010 }}.

===== Contemporary =====
The city gave its name to a musical genre known as the Canterbury Sound or [[Canterbury Scene]], a group of [[progressive rock]], [[avant-garde]] and jazz musicians established within the city during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some very notable Canterbury bands were [[Soft Machine]], [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]], [[Matching Mole]], [[Egg (band)|Egg]], [[Hatfield and the North]], [[National Health]], [[Gilgamesh (band)|Gilgamesh]], [[Soft Heap]], [[Khan (band)|Khan]], [[Camel (band)|Camel]] and [[In Cahoots]]. Over the years, with band membership changes and new bands evolving, the term has been used to describe a musical style or subgenre, rather than a regional group of musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canterbury Scene&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Canterbury Scene| website=Allmusic | url = {{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d10981|pure_url=yes}}|  accessdate =29 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport in the city ==

=== Railway ===
[[File:Canterbury West railway station building.JPG|thumb|[[Canterbury West railway station]]. The world's first regular passenger railway ran from this site, and it was here that the world's first season ticket was issued. Today, the railway station connects with &quot;High Speed 1&quot;, on which trains run to London at up to {{convert|140|mph|0|abbr=out}}.]]
Canterbury was the terminus of the [[Canterbury &amp; Whitstable Railway]] (known locally as the Crab and Winkle line), which was a pioneer line, opening on 3 May 1830 and closing in 1953. The Canterbury &amp; Whitstable was the first regular passenger steam railway in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin225-231&quot;&gt;Graham Martin, ''From Vision to Reality: the Making of the University of Kent at Canterbury'' ([[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]], 1990) pages 225–231 {{ISBN|0-904938-03-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first station in Canterbury was at North Lane.

Canterbury has two [[railway station]]s, called [[Canterbury West railway station|Canterbury West]] and [[Canterbury East railway station|Canterbury East]] (despite both stations being west of the city centre, Canterbury West is to the northwest and Canterbury East is to the southwest). Both stations are operated by [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]. Canterbury West station, on the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] from [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford]], was opened on 6 February 1846, and on 13 April the line to [[Ramsgate railway station|Ramsgate]] was completed. Canterbury West is served by [[High Speed 1]] trains to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]], slower stopping services to [[Charing Cross railway station|London Charing Cross]] and [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] as well as by trains to Ramsgate and [[Margate railway station|Margate]]. Canterbury East, the more central of the two stations, was opened by the [[London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway]] on 9 July 1860. Services from [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] stop at Canterbury East and continue to [[Dover Priory railway station|Dover]].

Because the two main lines into the city were built by rival companies, there is no direct interchange between Canterbury West and Canterbury East. A proposed [[Canterbury Parkway railway station]] would allow this, as well as acting as a further station for commuters avoiding the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kentonline.co.uk/canterbury/news/mp-in-talks-over-third-train-station-188985/|title=MP Rosie Duffield in talks over proposals for new Canterbury Parkway railway station|work=Kent Online|date=31 August 2018|accessdate=10 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canterbury used to be served by two other stations. [[Canterbury North Lane railway station|North Lane station]] was the southern terminus of the Canterbury &amp; Whitstable Railway between 1830 and 1846. [[Canterbury South railway station|Canterbury South]] was on the [[Elham Valley Railway]]. The station opened in 1889 and closed, along with the rest of the railway, in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hart|first=Brian|title=The Elham Valley Railway|publisher=Wild Swan Books|year=2015|isbn=9780953877126|location=Bath|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Road ===
[[File:Canterbury Coach stn.JPG|thumb|right|Central Bus station]]
Canterbury is by-passed by the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] London to Dover Road. It is about {{convert|45|mi|km}} from the [[M25 motorway|M25]] London orbital motorway, and {{convert|61|mi|km}} from [[central London]] by road. One of the other main roads through Canterbury is the [[A28 road|A28]] from [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] to Ramsgate and Margate.

The City Council has invested in [[Canterbury Park and Ride|Park and Ride]] systems around the city's outskirts, with three sites: at Wincheap, New Dover Road and Sturry Road. There are plans to build direct access sliproads to and from the London directions of the A2 where it meets the congested Wincheap (at present there are only slips from the A28 to and from the direction of Dover) to allow more direct access to Canterbury from the A2, but these are currently subject to local discussion. In 2011 a third junction was constructed, linking the A28 to the northbound A2; this leaves just the A2 southbound exit missing, but since this would cut across the Park &amp; Ride car park and meet the A28 at an already complicated junction, it is not expected to be added in the near term.&lt;ref name=&quot;canterburybyroad&quot;&gt;[http://www.canterbury.co.uk/thedms.asp?dms=11&amp;catid=68&amp;easi=true&amp;msg=Browsing$$Travel$Travel$$%20in%20Canterbury How to Get Here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816013413/http://www.canterbury.co.uk/thedms.asp?dms=11&amp;catid=68&amp;easi=true&amp;msg=Browsing$$Travel$Travel$$%20in%20Canterbury |date=16 August 2008 }}. www.canterbury.co.uk.

=== Cycling and walking ===
In the city centre, [[National Cycle Route 1|National Cycle Routes 1]] and [[National Cycle Route 18|18]] cross and go off towards Whitstable on the Crab and Winkle Way (1), and Chartham via the Great Stour Way (18), providing easy access by bike from the west of the city. There are also multiple cycle routes into the city centre from Nackington Road (Simon Langton Boys School), Hales Place, the University, St Dunstans and Harbledown, Blean, Rough Common and St Stephens. Footpaths scatter the city and give access to beauty spots such as on New House Lane and Stuppington with views of the city and Cathedral. Kent Cycle Hire runs a private hire service to cycle to Whitstable and Herne Bay, and from the University to the high street. Next to buses, cycling is the most popular transport option in Canterbury due to good cycle routes and the flat of the valley in the City centre and immediate suburbs.

St John's Church of England Primary School was founded as a Board School in 1876. The original neo-Classical school building on St John's Place is now a private house, with the school housed in larger buildings at the end of the street.

Independent secondary schools include [[Kent College]], [[St Edmund's School]] and [[The King's School, Canterbury|the King's School]], the oldest in the United Kingdom. St. Augustine established a school shortly after his arrival in Canterbury in 597, and it is from this that the King's School grew.

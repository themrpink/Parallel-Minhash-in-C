As time went by, [[Digor (people)|Digor]] in the west came under [[Kabard]] and [[Islamic]] influence. It was through the [[Kabard]]ians (an East [[Circassia]]n tribe) that [[Islam]] was introduced into the region in the 17th century. After 1767, all of Alania came under Russian rule, which strengthened [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in that region considerably. A substantial minority of today's Ossetians are followers of the traditional Ossetian religion.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''''Anne of the Thousand Days''''' is a 1969 British [[Period drama|period drama film]] based on the life of [[Anne Boleyn]], directed by [[Charles Jarrott]] and produced by [[Hal B. Wallis]]. The screenplay by [[Bridget Boland]] and John Hale is an adaptation of the 1948 play of the same name by [[Maxwell Anderson]].

The film stars [[Richard Burton]] as [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] and Canadian actress [[Geneviève Bujold]] as Anne Boleyn. [[Irene Papas]] plays [[Catherine of Aragon]], [[Anthony Quayle]] plays Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]], and [[John Colicos]] plays [[Thomas Cromwell]]. Others in the cast include [[Michael Hordern]], [[Katharine Blake (actress)|Katharine Blake]], [[Peter Jeffrey]], [[Joseph O'Conor]], [[William Squire]], [[Vernon Dobtcheff]], [[Denis Quilley]], [[Esmond Knight]], and [[T. P. McKenna]], who later played Henry VIII in [[Monarch (film)|''Monarch'']]. Burton's wife [[Elizabeth Taylor]] makes a brief, uncredited appearance.

Despite receiving some negative reviews&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Anne of the Thousand Days'' seems to have been made for one person: the Queen of England&quot;, ''Time'' Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; and mixed reviews from ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9907EFDA1F39EF34BC4951DFB766838B669EDE&amp;oref=slogin |work=The New York Times |first=Vincent |last=Canby |title=Screen: A Royal Battle of the Sexes:'Anne of 1,000 Days' Bows at Plaza Burton Cast as Henry Miss Bujold Stars |date=21 January 1970 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008030712/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9907EFDA1F39EF34BC4951DFB766838B669EDE&amp;oref=slogin |archivedate=8 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pauline Kael]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.ws/paulinekaelreviews/a5.html|title=Pauline Kael|website=www.geocities.ws}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film was nominated for 10 [[Academy Awards]] and won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|best costumes]]. Geneviève Bujold's portrayal of Anne, her first in an English language film, was very highly praised, even by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, which otherwise skewered the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878191,00.html | work=Time | title=Cinema: The Lion in Autumn | date=2 February 1970 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Academy Awards]] exposé ''Inside Oscar'', an expensive advertising campaign was mounted by [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] that included serving [[champagne]] and [[filet mignon]] to members of the Academy following each screening.&lt;ref&gt;''Inside Oscar'', Mason Wiley and Damien Boa, Ballantine Books (1986) pg. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[London]], [[1536]]. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] considers whether or not he should sign the warrant for the execution of his second wife, [[Anne Boleyn]].

Nine years earlier, Henry has a problem: he reveals his dissatisfaction with his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]]. He is enjoying a discreet affair with [[Mary Boleyn]], a daughter of one of his courtiers, Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]]; but the king is bored with her too. At a court ball, he notices Mary's 18-year-old sister [[Anne Boleyn|Anne]], who has returned from her education in France. She is engaged to the [[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland|son of the Earl of Northumberland]], and they have received their parents' permission to marry. The king, however, is enraptured with Anne's beauty and orders [[Cardinal Wolsey]], his [[Lord Chancellor]], to break the engagement.

When news of this decision is carried to Anne, she reacts furiously. She blames the cardinal and the king for ruining her happiness. When Henry makes a rather clumsy attempt to seduce her, Anne bluntly informs him how she finds him: &quot;I've heard what your courtiers say, and I've seen what you are. You're spoiled and vengeful and bloody. Your poetry is sour, and your music is worse. You make love as you eat—with a good deal of noise and no subtlety.&quot;

Henry brings her back to court with him, and she continues to resist his advances out of a mixture of repugnance for Henry and her lingering anger over her broken engagement. However, she becomes intoxicated with the power that the king's love gives her. &quot;Power is as exciting as love,&quot; she tells her brother [[George Boleyn]], &quot;and who has more of it than the king?&quot; Using this power, she continually undermines [[Cardinal Wolsey]], who at first sees Anne as a passing love interest for the king.

When Henry again presses Anne to become his mistress, she repeats that she never will give birth to a child who is illegitimate. Desperate to have a son, Henry suddenly comes up with the idea of marrying Anne in Catherine's place. Anne is stunned, but she agrees. Wolsey begs the king to abandon the idea because of the political consequences of divorcing Catherine. Henry refuses to listen.

When Wolsey fails to persuade the pope to give Henry his divorce, Anne points out this failing to an enraged Henry. Wolsey is dismissed from office, and his magnificent palace in London is given as a present to Anne. In this splendour, Anne realises that she has finally fallen in love with Henry. They sleep together, and after discovering that she is pregnant, they secretly are married. Anne is given a splendid coronation, but the people jeer at her in disgust as &quot;the king's whore&quot;.

Months later, Anne gives birth to a daughter: [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]]. Henry is displeased because he was hoping for a boy, and their marital relationship begins to cool. His attentions are soon diverted to Lady [[Jane Seymour]], one of Anne's maids. Once she discovers this liaison, Anne banishes Jane from court. &quot;She has the face of a simpering sheep,&quot; she informs Henry, &quot;and the manners, but not the morals. I don't want her near me.&quot;

During a row over Sir [[Thomas More]]'s opposition to Anne's queenship, Anne refuses to sleep with her husband unless More is put to death. &quot;It's his blood, or else it's my blood and Elizabeth's!&quot; she cries hysterically. More is put to death, but Anne's subsequent pregnancy ends, resulting in a stillborn boy.

Henry demands that his new minister [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] find a way to get rid of Anne. Cromwell tortures a servant in her household into confessing to adultery with the queen; he then arrests four other courtiers who are also accused of being Anne's lovers. Anne is taken to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] and placed under arrest. When she is told that she has been accused of adultery, she laughs. &quot;I thought you were serious!&quot; she says, and then she is informed that it is deadly serious. When she sees her brother being brought into the Tower, Anne asks why he has been arrested. &quot;He too is accused of being your lover,&quot; mutters her embarrassed uncle. Anne's face shudders with horror before she whispers &quot;Incest?... Oh, God help me, the king is mad. I am doomed.&quot;

At Anne's trial, she manages to cross-question [[Mark Smeaton]], the tortured servant who finally admits that the charges against Anne are lies. Henry makes an appearance, then visits Anne in her chambers that night. He offers her freedom if she will agree to annul their marriage and make their daughter illegitimate. Anne refuses, saying that she would rather die than betray their daughter. Henry slaps her and tells her that her disobedience will mean her death.

Moving back to 1536, Henry decides to execute Anne. A few days later, Anne is taken to the scaffold and beheaded by a French swordsman. Henry rides off to marry [[Jane Seymour]], and  their young daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], toddling alone in the garden as she hears the cannon firing to announce her mother's death. Anne's voice is heard reciting a prophecy she spoke to Henry in the Tower: &quot;Elizabeth shall be a greater queen than any king of yours. She shall rule a greater England than you could ever have built. My Elizabeth shall be queen, and my blood will have been well spent.&quot;

==Background and production==
The play ''Anne of the Thousand Days'', the film's basis, was first enacted on Broadway in the [[Shubert Theatre (New York City)|Shubert Theatre]] on 8 December 1948; staged by [[H.C. Potter]], with [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Joyce Redman]] as Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn respectively, running 288 performances; Harrison won a [[Tony Award]] for his performance.

Cinematically, ''Anne of the Thousand Days'' took 20 years to reach the screen because its themes – adultery, illegitimacy, incest – were then unacceptable to the U.S. motion picture [[production code]]. The film was made on such locations as [[Penshurst Place]] and [[Hever Castle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064030/locations|title=Anne of the Thousand Days (1969) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] and [[Shepperton Studios]].
Hever Castle was one of the main settings for the film; it was also the childhood home of Anne Boleyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1969/01/anne-of-a-thousand-days-1969/|title=Kent Film Office Anne of the Thousand Days Film Focus|author=Kent Film Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British actress [[Olivia Hussey]] was the first choice for the role of Anne Boleyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://production.grouchoreviews.com/interviews/229|title=Groucho Reviews: Interview: Olivia Hussey—Romeo and Juliet|author=Groucho|website=Groucho Reviews|accessdate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] first met Hussey in New York in November 1967 at a party for her then upcoming film ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1968), he offered her the title role. In addition, he also offered her to star with [[John Wayne]] in ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969). In her 2019 memoir, Hussey stated that she had &quot;mumbled something about being interested in ''Anne of the Thousand Days''” but added that she &quot;couldn’t see herself with Wayne&quot;. She claims that this &quot;adolescent and opinionated&quot; remark inevitably ended her professional relationship with Wallis, and he immediately withdrew his offer from her. &quot;It had taken me less than a minute to talk my way out of it&quot; Hussey stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The girl on the balcony : Olivia Hussey finds life after Romeo &amp; Juliet|last1=Hussey|first1=Olivia|isbn=1496717074|edition=First Kensington hardcoverition|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell Anderson employed [[blank verse]] for parts of his play, but most examples of this were removed from the screenplay. One blank verse episode that was retained was Anne's soliloquy in the [[Tower of London]]. The opening of the play was changed, with [[Thomas Cromwell]]'s telling [[Henry VIII]] the outcome of the trial and Henry's recalling his marriage to Anne rather than Anne's speaking first and then Henry's remembering in flashback.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ncRbgYvnQTAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Anne+of+the+Thousand+Days&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OIwcT6DMKIOutweOm5iXCw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Anne%20of%20the%20Thousand%20Days&amp;f=false Anne of the Thousand Days], ''Google books'', accessed 15 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
* Historians dispute King Henry VIII's paternity of one or both of Mary Boleyn's children. ''Henry VIII: The King and His Court'' by [[Alison Weir]] questions the paternity of Henry Carey;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir-Henry&amp;Court&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Weir |title=Henry VIII: The King and His Court |pages=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. G.W. Bernard (''The King's Reformation'') and Joanna Denny (''Anne Boleyn: A New Life of England's Tragic Queen'') argue that Henry VIII was their father.
* Anne Boleyn might not have been 18 years old in 1527; her birth date is unrecorded. Most historians today believe that she must have been about 25 in 1527.
* There is no proof that Henry VIII ordered the breaking of Henry Percy and Anne Boleyn's engagement because he wanted Anne for himself. Percy's family, the Northumberlands, were one of the leading families in the North of England, and they always wanted Henry Percy to marry Mary Talbot, a rich heiress from the same region, and not a girl from a comparatively lower status family. They might have asked the king's and Cardinal Wolsey's intervention when the engagement was made public. In fact, in order to have no impediment for Henry VIII's and Anne's marriage, all parties always denied that any engagement had taken place.
* Most histories of the period say nothing about Anne's pressuring Henry to have More executed.
* Catherine of Aragon's daughter, Mary, was not present at the time of Catherine's final illness and death; they were being kept apart forcibly.
* Catherine of Aragon's depiction by Irene Papas was wrong in terms of appearance; it is well documented that the queen had auburn hair and a very pale complexion. Papas was chosen as she has a stereotypical Mediterranean appearance, matching false popular assumptions on how a 'Spanish' noble would look.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
* The meeting between Anne and Henry shortly before her execution is fictional, and even if such a meeting had taken place, some details of their discussion are implausible. Anne's marriage was annulled anyway, and she never was offered a deal that would have given her her freedom. Elizabeth and Mary were both declared illegitimate, but were nevertheless in the line of succession, but not until after Anne's death. Thus, at that point, the chance of Elizabeth's inheriting the crown must have seemed small.
* Henry did not intervene in Anne's trial; she was disallowed the right to question the witnesses against her. She and the king met last at a joust the day before her arrest.
* ''Anne of the Thousand Days'' depicts Anne as innocent of the charges, and this depiction is considered historically correct per the biographies by Eric W. Ives, [[Retha Warnicke]], Joanna Denny, and Tudor historian [[David Starkey]], which all state her innocence of adultery, incest, and witchcraft.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics, most commonly the plot was considered dull and plodding. Beyond the story itself, the performances of [[Geneviève Bujold]], [[Richard Burton]], and [[Irene Papas]] were met with universal acclaim, especially that of Bujold. Bujold remains the only actress nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for playing [[Anne Boleyn]].

The film was one of the more popular movies of 1970 at the British box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTmrBgAAQBAJ&amp;q=guinness+book+of+box+office+hits+swern+childs&amp;pg=PA268|title=British Film Culture in the 1970s: The Boundaries of Pleasure: The Boundaries of Pleasure|first=Sue|last= Harper|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2011|isbn = 9780748654260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Moors''' were the [[Muslim]] inhabitants of the [[Maghreb]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Sicily]], and [[Malta]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. The Moors initially were the indigenous [[Maghreb]]ine [[Berbers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Leo&quot;/&gt; The name was later also applied to [[Arabs]].&lt;ref&gt;The Arabs called the latter ''[[Muladi|Muwalladun]]'' or ''Muladi''.

Moors are not a distinct or [[ethnonym|self-defined]] people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/12049/1/Ramos_umd_0117E_12042.pdf Ross Brann, &quot;The Moors?&quot;], ''Andalusia'', New York University. Quote: &quot;Andalusi Arabic sources, as opposed to later [[Mudéjar]] and [[Morisco]] sources in Aljamiado and medieval Spanish texts, neither refer to individuals as Moors nor recognize any such group, community or culture.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica observed that &quot;The term 'Moors' has no real ethnological value.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Moors |volume=18 |page=812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans of the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]] variously applied the name to [[Arabs]], North African Berbers, and Muslim Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackmore|first=Josiah|author-link=Josiah Blackmore|title=Moorings: Portuguese Expansion and the Writing of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRNFebS_mUIC&amp;pg=PR16|year=2009|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-4832-0|page=xvi, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used in Europe in a broader, somewhat derogatory sense to refer to Muslims in general,&lt;ref name=&quot;Menocal, María Rosa 2002 page 241&quot;&gt;Menocal, María Rosa (2002). ''Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain''.

American Ceylon Mission Press, Tellippalai Ceylon 1918&lt;/ref&gt; In the Philippines, the longstanding Muslim community, which predates the arrival of the Spanish, now self-identifies as the &quot;[[Moro people]]&quot;, an [[exonym]] introduced by Spanish colonizers due to their Muslim faith.

In 711, troops mostly formed by Moors from northern Africa led the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]]. The Iberian peninsula then came to be known in [[Classical Arabic]] as [[al-Andalus]], which at its peak included most of [[Septimania]] and modern-day [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]].

In 827, the Moors occupied [[Mazara del Vallo|Mazara]] on [[Sicily]], developing it as a [[Port (nautical)|port]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assessment of the status, development and diversification of fisheries-dependent communities: Mazara del Vallo Case study report |url= http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/documentation/studies/regional_social_economic_impacts/mazara_del_vallo_en.pdf |year= 2010 |publisher= [[European Commission]] |page = 2 |quote = In the year 827, Mazara was occupied by the Arabs, who made the city an important commercial harbour.

Differences in religion and culture led to a centuries-long conflict with the [[Christendom|Christian kingdoms of Europe]], which tried to reclaim control of Muslim areas; this conflict was referred to as the [[Reconquista]]. In 1224 the Muslims were expelled from Sicily to the [[Muslim settlement of Lucera|settlement of Lucera]], which was destroyed by European Christians in 1300.

The [[fall of Granada]] in 1492 marked the end of Muslim rule in Spain, although [[Morisco|a Muslim minority]] persisted until [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|their expulsion]] in 1609.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hillgarth|first=J.

==Name==

===Etymology===
{{further|Mauri people|Mauretania}}
During the classical period, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] interacted with, and later conquered, parts of [[Mauretania]], a state that covered modern northern [[Morocco]], western [[Algeria]], and the Spanish cities [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Ceuta|journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project|date=1752|page=871|hdl=2027/spo.did2222.0000.555}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Berbers|Berber]] tribes of the region were noted in the [[Classics]] as ''[[Mauri people|Mauri]]'', which was subsequently rendered as &quot;Moors&quot; in English and in related variations in other European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Moor&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mauri'' (Μαῦροι) is recorded as the native name by [[Strabo]] in the early 1st century. This appellation was also adopted into Latin, whereas the Greek name for the tribe was ''Maurusii'' ({{lang-grc|Μαυρούσιοι}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|οἰκοῦσι δ᾽ ἐνταῦθα Μαυρούσιοι μὲν ὑπὸ τῶν Ἑλλήνων λεγόμενοι, Μαῦροι δ᾽ ὑπὸ τῶν Ῥωμαίων καὶ τῶν ἐπιχωρίων}} &quot;Here dwell a people called by the Greeks Maurusii, and by the Romans and the natives Mauri&quot; Strabo, ''Geographica'' 17.3.2. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DMauri Lewis and Short, ''Latin Dictionary'', 1879 ''s.v.'' &quot;Mauri&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Moors were also mentioned by [[Tacitus]] as having revolted against the [[Roman Empire]] in 24 [[Anno Domini|AD]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Tacitus, Arthur Murphy, The Historical Annals of Cornelius Tacitus: With Supplements, Volume 1 (D. Neall, 1829 ) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MEoWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=Cinithians&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q_kP1ceEht&amp;sig=ld5UHNpEEv92gvMyVat1Npyx9m8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDxYTvq4HVAhXHErwKHcjXCywQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Cinithians&amp;f=false p114].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Latin Middle Ages, ''Mauri'' was used to refer to Berbers and Arabs in the coastal regions of Northwest Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordIslamic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bridgingcultures.neh.gov/muslimjourneys/items/show/218|title='Moors' from Oxford Islamic Studies Online|last1=Assouline|first1=David|website=Muslim Journeys|publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World in the Oxford Islamic Studies Online.|access-date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th century scholar [[Leo Africanus]] (c. 1494–1554) identified the Moors (''Mauri'') as the native Berber inhabitants of the former [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Province]] ([[Roman Africans]]). He described Moors as one of five main population groups on the continent alongside [[Egyptians]], [[Abyssinian people|Abyssinians]] (Abassins), Arabians and [[Kaffir (racial term)|Cafri]] (Cafates).&lt;ref name=&quot;Leo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Africanus|first1=Leo|title=The History and Description of Africa|date=1526|publisher=Hakluyt Society|pages=20 &amp; 108|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyanddescr03porygoog#page/n150/|access-date=30 August 2017|quote=the Mauri -- or Moors -- were the Berbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern meanings===
In medieval [[Romance languages]], variations of the [[Latin]] word for the Moors (for instance, [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''moro'', [[French language|French]]: ''maure'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''mouro'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''maur'') developed different applications and connotations. The term initially denoted a specific Berber people in western [[ancient Libya|Libya]], but the name acquired more general meaning during the medieval period, associated with &quot;[[Muslim]]&quot;, similar to associations with &quot;[[Saracen]]s&quot;. During the context of the [[Crusades]] and the [[Reconquista]], the term Moors included the derogatory suggestion of &quot;infidels&quot;.

Apart from these historic associations and context, ''Moor'' and ''Moorish'' designate a specific ethnic group speaking [[Hassaniya Arabic]]. They inhabit [[Mauritania]] and parts of [[Algeria]], [[Western Sahara]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Niger]], and [[Mali]]. In Niger and Mali, these peoples are also known as the [[Azawagh Arabs]], after the [[Azawagh]] region of the Sahara.&lt;ref&gt;For an introduction to the culture of the Azawagh Arabs, see Rebecca Popenoe, ''Feeding Desire — Fatness, Beauty and Sexuality among a Saharan People''. Routledge, London (2003) {{ISBN|0-415-28096-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Diccionario de la lengua española|authoritative dictionary of the Spanish language]] does not list any derogatory meaning for the word ''moro'', a term generally referring to people of [[Maghreb]]ian origin in particular or Muslims in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dle.rae.es/|title=&quot;Diccionario de la lengua española&quot; - Edición del Tricentenario|first=RAE-|last=ASALE|website=«Diccionario de la lengua española» - Edición del Tricentenario}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have pointed out that in modern colloquial Spanish use of the term ''moro'' is derogatory for [[Moroccans]] in particular&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simms|first=Karl|title=Translating sensitive texts: linguistic aspects|year=1997|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-0260-9|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t4y7EHgCn8kC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warwick Armstrong|first=James Anderson|title=Geopolitics of European Union enlargement: the fortress empire|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-33939-1|page=83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0pmkrY29qkIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wessendorf|first=Susanne|title=The multiculturalism backlash: European discourses, policies and practices|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-55649-1|page=171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUaHVimJkT0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Tariq Modood]], Anna Triandafyllidou|first=[[Ricard Zapata-Barrero]]|title=Multiculturalism, Muslims and citizenship: a European approach|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-35515-5|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OAAV5eEmy4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bekers|first=Elisabeth|title=Transcultural modernities: narrating Africa in Europe|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-2538-7|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4_on188WJwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muslim]]s in general.

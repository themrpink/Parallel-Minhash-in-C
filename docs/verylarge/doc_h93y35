[[File:White shark (Carcharodon carcharias) scavenging on whale carcass - journal.pone.0060797.g004-A.png|thumb|A shark scavenging on a whale carcass in False Bay, South Africa]]
Whale carcasses comprise an important part of the diet of white sharks. However, this has rarely been observed due to whales dying in remote areas. It has been estimated that {{cvt|30|kg}} of whale blubber could feed a {{cvt|4.5|m|ft}} white shark for 1.5 months. Detailed observations were made of four whale carcasses in False Bay between 2000 and 2010. Sharks were drawn to the carcass by chemical and odour detection, spread by strong winds. After initially feeding on the whale caudal peduncle and [[fluke (tail)|fluke]], the sharks would investigate the carcass by slowly swimming around it and mouthing several parts before selecting a blubber-rich area. During feeding bouts of 15–20 seconds the sharks removed flesh with lateral headshakes, without the protective ocular rotation they employ when attacking live prey. The sharks were frequently observed regurgitating chunks of blubber and immediately returning to feed, possibly in order to replace low energy yield pieces with high energy yield pieces, using their teeth as mechanoreceptors to distinguish them. After feeding for several hours, the sharks appeared to become lethargic, no longer swimming to the surface; they were observed mouthing the carcass but apparently unable to bite hard enough to remove flesh, they would instead bounce off and slowly sink. Up to eight sharks were observed feeding simultaneously, bumping into each other without showing any signs of aggression; on one occasion a shark accidentally bit the head of a neighbouring shark, leaving two teeth embedded, but both continued to feed unperturbed. Smaller individuals hovered around the carcass eating chunks that drifted away. Unusually for the area, large numbers of sharks over five metres long were observed, suggesting that the largest sharks change their behaviour to search for whales as they lose the manoeuvrability required to hunt seals. The investigating team concluded that the importance of whale carcasses, particularly for the largest white sharks, has been underestimated.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrkosekFallows2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krkosek|first1=Martin|last2=Fallows|first2=Chris|last3=Gallagher|first3=Austin J.|last4=Hammerschlag|first4=Neil|title=White Sharks (''Carcharodon carcharias'') Scavenging on Whales and Its Potential Role in Further Shaping the Ecology of an Apex Predator|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=4|year=2013|pages=e60797|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0060797|pmid=23585850|pmc=3621969}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another documented incident, white sharks were observed scavenging on a whale carcass alongside tiger sharks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dudley |first=Sheldon F.

The sharks utilized the classic attack strategy utilized on pinnipeds when attacking the whale, even utilizing the bite-and-spit tactic they employ on smaller prey items. The whale was an entangled individual, heavily emaciated and thus more vulnerable to the sharks' attacks.

=== Reproduction ===
Great white sharks were previously thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 years to reach sexual maturity.&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History of the White Shark |url=http://www.prbo.org/cms/176 |date=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015943/http://www.prbo.org/cms/176 |archive-date=3 July 2013 |publisher=PRBO Conservation Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1909550/legendary-great-white-shark-was-just-a-teenager-when-killed-new-research-reveals/|title=Legendary Great White Shark Was Just A Teenager When Killed, New Research Reveals|work=The Inquisitr News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum life span was originally believed to be more than 30 years, but a study by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late sexual maturity, low reproductive rate, long gestation period of 11 months and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencedaily.com&quot;/&gt;

Little is known about the great white shark's [[mating]] habits, and mating behaviour had not been observed in this species until 1997 and properly documented in 2020. It was assumed previously to be possible that whale carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrkosekFallows2013&quot;/&gt; According to the testimony of fisherman Dick Ledgerwood, who observed two great white sharks mating in the area near Port Chalmers and Otago Harbor, in New Zealand, it is theorized that great white sharks mate in shallow water away from feeding areas and continually roll belly to belly during copulation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/04/rolling-and-rolling-and-rolling-the-first-detailed-account-of-great-white-shark-sex?CMP=share_btn_fb&amp;fbclid=IwAR1CkbDeumXjGfvl_-pMl-R1pQBpgBXXQzFO5ZcpTuKY6pS9mVrNKay7FQ8&lt;/ref&gt; Birth has never been observed, but pregnant females have been examined.

=== Breaching behaviour ===
[[File:Great white shark near Gansbaai, South Africa.jpg|thumb|Great white shark breaching near [[Gansbaai]] in [[South Africa]]]]

A [[Whale surfacing behavior|breach]] is the result of a high speed approach to the surface with the resulting momentum taking the shark partially or completely clear of the water. This is a hunting technique employed by great white sharks whilst hunting seals. This technique is often used on cape fur seals at [[Seal Island, South Africa|Seal Island]] in [[False Bay]], [[South Africa]]. Because the behaviour is unpredictable, it is very hard to document. It was first photographed by [[Chris Fallows]] and Rob Lawrence who developed the technique of towing a slow-moving seal decoy to trick the sharks to breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/breaching.htm |title=White Shark Breaching |publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research |access-date=18 April 2012 |author=Martin, R. Aidan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between April and September, scientists may observe around 600 breaches. The seals swim on the surface and the great white sharks launch their predatory attack from the deeper water below. They can reach speeds of up to {{cvt|40|km/h|mph}} and can at times launch themselves more than {{cvt|10|ft|m|order=flip|0}} into the air. Just under half of observed breach attacks are successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=R. A. |last2=Hammerschlag |first2=N. |last3=Collier |first3=R.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Shark bite incidents ===
{{Main|Shark attack}}

Of all shark species, the great white shark is responsible for by far the largest number of recorded shark bite incidents on humans, with 272 documented unprovoked bite incidents on humans as of 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;isaf&quot;/&gt;

More than any documented bite incident, [[Peter Benchley]]'s best-selling novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]'' and the subsequent [[Jaws (film)|1975 film adaptation]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] provided the great white shark with the image of being a &quot;[[man-eater]]&quot; in the public mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Benchley |date=April 2000 |title=Great white sharks |journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |page=12 |quote=considering the knowledge accumulated about sharks in the last 25 years, I couldn't possibly write Jaws today ... not in good conscience anyway ... back then, it was OK to demonize an animal. |issn=0027-9358}}&lt;/ref&gt; While great white sharks have killed humans in at least 74 documented unprovoked bite incidents, they typically do not target them: for example, in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] there have been 31 confirmed bite incidents against humans in the last two centuries, most of which were non-fatal. Many of the incidents seemed to be &quot;test-bites&quot;. Great white sharks also test-bite [[buoy]]s, [[flotsam]], and other unfamiliar objects, and they might grab a human or a [[surfboard]] to identify what it is.
[[File:Surfacing great white shark.jpg|thumb|left|The great white shark is one of only four kinds of shark that have been involved in a significant number of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans.|alt=Photo of open-mouthed shark at surface.]]
Contrary to popular belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/01/0123_040123_tvgreatwhiteshark.html|title=Great White Shark Attacks: Defanging the Myths|work=nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bite incidents occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to not like the taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite whether or not the object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer seals, which are fat and rich in protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/mistaken_identity.htm|title=White Shark Attacks: Mistaken Identity|last=Martin|first=R. Aidan|year=2003|website=Biology of Sharks and Rays|publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research|access-date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans are not appropriate prey because the shark's digestion is too slow to cope with a human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 of which were fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISAF Statistics for Worldwide Unprovoked White Shark Attacks Since 1990|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/White/whitesharkdecade.html|date=10 February 2011|access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some researchers have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, chair of aquatic biology at the [[California Academy of Sciences]], noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the [[University of Hawaii]], suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability to move out of reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=T.C.|last=Tricas|author2=McCosker, John |journal=Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences |series=Series 4 |title=Predatory behavior of the white shark, ''Carcharodon carcharias'', and notes on its biology|volume=43|issue=14|pages=221–238|year=1984 |url=https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_109514_predatorybehaviourofthewhitesh1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shark culling ===
{{Main|shark culling}}

[[Shark culling]] is the deliberate killing of sharks by a government in an attempt to reduce [[shark attack]]s; shark culling is often called &quot;shark control&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;shark_culling&quot;/&gt; These programs have been criticized by environmentalists and scientists—they say these programs harm the [[marine ecosystem]]; they also say such programs are &quot;outdated, cruel, and ineffective&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.ntd.tv/2018/09/04/video-endangered-hammerhead-sharks-dead-on-drum-line-in-great-barrier-reef/ |last=Phillips |first=Jack |date=4 September 2018 |title=Video: Endangered Hammerhead Sharks Dead on Drum Line in Great Barrier Reef |publisher=Ntd.tv |access-date=30 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919094449/https://www.ntd.tv/2018/09/04/video-endangered-hammerhead-sharks-dead-on-drum-line-in-great-barrier-reef/ |archive-date=19 September 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many different species ([[dolphins]], [[turtles]], etc.) are also killed in these programs (because of their use of [[shark nets]] and [[drum line (shark control)|drum lines]])—15,135 marine animals were killed in New South Wales' nets between 1950 and 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;shark_culling&quot;/&gt; and 84,000 marine animals were killed by Queensland authorities from 1962 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.afd.org.au/news-articles/queenslands-shark-control-program-has-snagged-84000-animals |title=Action for Dolphins.

Great white sharks are currently killed in both [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] in &quot;shark control&quot; (shark culling) programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;shark_culling&quot;/&gt; Queensland uses [[shark nets]] and [[drum line (shark control)|drum lines with baited hooks]], while New South Wales only uses nets. From 1962 to 2018, Queensland authorities killed about 50,000 sharks, many of which were great whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;decline&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roff|first1=George|first2=Christopher J.|last2=Brown|first3=Mark A.|last3=Priest|first4=Peter J.|last4=Mumby|title=Decline of coastal apex shark populations over the past half century|journal=Communications Biology|volume=1|issue=1|year=2018|pages=1–11|doi=10.1038/s42003-018-0233-1|pmid=30564744|pmc=6292889}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013 to 2014 alone, 667 sharks were killed by Queensland authorities, including great white sharks.&lt;ref name=&quot;shark_culling&quot;/&gt; In Queensland, great white sharks found alive on the drum lines are shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;onegreenplanet&quot;/&gt; In New South Wales, between 1950 and 2008, a total of 577 great white sharks were killed in [[shark net|nets]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shark_culling&quot;/&gt; Between September 2017 and April 2018, fourteen great white sharks were killed in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.swellnet.com/news/swellnet-dispatch/2018/08/04/sydney-shark-nets-set-stay-despite-drumline-success |last=Mackenzie |first=Bruce |date=4 August 2018 |title=Sydney Shark Nets Set to Stay Despite Drumline Success |publisher=Swellnet.com. |access-date=30 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[KwaZulu-Natal]] (an area of [[South Africa]]) also has a &quot;shark control&quot; program that kills great white sharks and other marine life. In a 30-year period, more than 33,000 sharks were killed in KwaZulu-Natal's shark-killing program, including great whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sharkangels.org/index.php/media/news/157-shark-nets |title=Shark Nets |publisher=Sharkangels.org |access-date=30 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the state government of [[Western Australia]] led by Premier [[Colin Barnett]] implemented a [[Western Australian shark cull|policy of killing large sharks]]. The policy, colloquially referred to as the [[Western Australian shark cull]], was intended to protect users of the marine environment from shark bite incidents, following the deaths of seven people on the [[Coastline of Western Australia|Western Australian coastline]] in the years 2010–2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/About-Us/Media-releases/Pages/New-measures-to-combat-WA-shark-risks.aspx|title=New measures to combat WA shark risks|publisher=Department of Fisheries, Western Australia|date=10 December 2013|access-date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baited [[drum lines]] were deployed near popular beaches using hooks designed to catch great white sharks, as well as [[bull shark|bull]] and [[tiger shark]]s.

=== Attacks on boats ===
Great white sharks infrequently bite and sometimes even sink boats. Only five of the 108 authenticated unprovoked shark bite incidents reported from the Pacific Coast during the 20th century involved [[kayak]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharkresearchcommittee.com/unprovoked_kayaker.htm|title=Unprovoked White Shark Attacks on Kayakers|publisher=Shark Research Committee|access-date=14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few cases they have bitten boats up to {{cvt|10|m}} in length. They have bumped or knocked people overboard, usually biting the boat from the stern. In one case in 1936, a large shark leapt completely into the [[South Africa]]n fishing boat ''Lucky Jim'', knocking a crewman into the sea. Tricas and McCosker's underwater observations suggest that sharks are attracted to boats by the electrical fields they generate, which are picked up by the ampullae of Lorenzini and confuse the shark about whether or not wounded prey might be near-by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tricas|first1=Timothy C.|last2=McCosker|first2=John E.|title=Predatory Behaviour of the White Shark (''Carcharodon carcharias''), with Notes on its Biology|year=1984|journal=Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences|volume=43|issue=14|pages=221–238|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/fishlab/pubs/Tricas%20&amp;%20McCosker%201984.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In captivity ===

Prior to August 1981, no great white shark in captivity lived longer than 11 days. In August 1981, a great white survived for 16 days at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] before being released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/2004-10-02-great-white_x.htm |title=Great white shark sets record at California aquarium |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2 October 2004|access-date=27 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of containing a live great white at [[SeaWorld Orlando]] was used in the 1983 film ''[[Jaws 3-D]]''.

[[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] first attempted to display a great white in 1984, but the shark died after 11 days because it did not eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/08/462455785/great-white-shark-dies-after-just-3-days-in-captivity-at-japan-aquarium |title=Great White Shark Dies After Just 3 Days In Captivity At Japan Aquarium |last=Hopkins |first=Christopher Dean |date=8 January 2016 |work=NPR |access-date=21 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403122512/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/08/462455785/great-white-shark-dies-after-just-3-days-in-captivity-at-japan-aquarium |archive-date=3 April 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2003, Monterey researchers captured a small female and kept it in a large netted pen near [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] for five days.

He was released on 16 January 2007, after 137 days in captivity.

Monterey Bay Aquarium housed a third great white, a juvenile male, for 162 days between 27 August 2007, and 5 February 2008. On arrival, he was {{cvt|1.4|m|ft}} long and weighed {{cvt|30.6|kg}}. He grew to {{cvt|1.8|m|ft}} and {{cvt|64|kg}} before release. A juvenile female came to the Outer Bay Exhibit on 27 August 2008. While she did swim well, the shark fed only one time during her stay and was tagged and released on 7 September 2008. Another juvenile female was captured near Malibu on 12 August 2009, introduced to the Outer Bay exhibit on 26 August 2009, and was successfully released into the wild on 4 November 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monterey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_whiteshark/whiteshark_ours.aspx |publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium |title=Learn All About Our New White Shark |access-date=28 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120151638/http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_whiteshark/whiteshark_ours.aspx |archive-date=20 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monterey Bay Aquarium introduced a 1.4-m-long male into their redesigned &quot;Open Sea&quot; exhibit on 31 August 2011. He was exhibited for 55 days, and was released into the wild on the 25th October the same year. However, the shark was determined to have died shortly after release via an attached electronic tag. The cause of death is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2011/09/01/new-great-white-shark-goes-on-display-at-monterey-bay-aquarium/|title=New great white shark goes on display at Monterey Bay Aquarium|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/11/03/great-white-shark-dies-shortly-after-release-from-monterey-aquarium/|title=Great White Shark Dies Shortly After Release From Monterey Aquarium|date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-xpm-2011-nov-03-la-trb-shark-monterey-aquarium-20111103-story.html|title=Great white shark dies after release from Monterey Bay Aquarium|date=3 November 2011|website=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Monterey Bay Aquarium does not plan to exhibit any more great whites, as the main purpose of containing them was scientific. As data from captive great whites were no longer needed, the institute has instead shifted its focus to study wild sharks.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/animals-a-to-z/white-shark&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the largest adult great whites ever exhibited was at Japan's [[Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium]] in 2016, where a {{cvt|3.5|m|ft}} male was exhibited for three days before dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Great White Shark Dies at Aquarium in Japan|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2016/01/08/great-white-shark-dies-at-japan-aquarium/?mod=e2fb|website=WSJ Blogs – Japan Real Time|access-date=9 January 2016|first=Jun|last=Hongo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Great white shark dies after three days in Japanese aquarium|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/12086603/Okinawa-Aquarium-showcases-only-great-white-shark-in-captivity-in-the-world.html|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the most famous captive was a {{cvt|2.4|m|ft}} female named Sandy, which in August 1980 became the only great white to be housed at the [[California Academy of Sciences]]' [[Steinhart Aquarium]] in [[San Francisco]], California. She was released because she would not eat and constantly bumped against the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/electroreception.htm |title=Electroreception |publisher=Elasmo-research|access-date=27 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to the vast amounts of resources required and the subsequent cost to keep a great white shark alive in captivity, their dietary preferences, size, migratory nature, and the stress of capture and containment, permanent exhibition of a great white shark is likely to be unfeasible.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencealert.com/the-reason-you-never-see-a-great-white-shark-in-an-aquarium#:~:text=Basically%2C%20there%20are%20two%20main%20reasons%20great%20whites,of%20the%20oceans%20no%20matter%20what%20zookeepers%20do.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shark tourism ===
Cage diving is most common at sites where great whites are frequent including the coast of South Africa, the [[Neptune Islands]] in South Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shark cage diving|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/marineparks/enjoy/shark-cage-diving|publisher=Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources|access-date=11 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409072843/http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/marineparks/Enjoy/shark-cage-diving |archive-date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guadalupe Island]] in [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]].

These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.

At present, hang baits are illegal off Isla Guadalupe and reputable dive operators do not use them. Operators in South Africa and Australia continue to use hang baits and [[pinniped]] decoys.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.bluewaterhunter.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Blue Water Hunting Successfully |url=http://www.bluewaterhunter.com/education/education_successfully.html |publisher=Blue Water Hunter |access-date=20 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818030820/http://www.bluewaterhunter.com/education/education_successfully.html |archive-date=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Australia, playing rock music recordings underwater, including the [[AC/DC]] album ''[[Back in Black]]'' has also been used experimentally to attract sharks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surfersvillage.com/content/great-white-sharks-favorite-tune-back-black &quot;A Great white shark's favorite tune?

Companies object to being blamed for shark bite incidents, pointing out that [[lightning]] tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Sharks/attacks/relarisklightning.htm |title=Shark Attacks Compared to Lightning|publisher=[[Florida Museum of Natural History]] |date=18 July 2003|access-date=7 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their position is that further research needs to be done before banning practices such as chumming, which may alter natural behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3716093.stm|title=SA shark attacks blamed on tourism|publisher=BBC|date=15 April 2004|access-date=24 October 2006|first=Richard|last=Hamilton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323072204/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3716093.stm |archive-date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway, well away from human leisure areas. Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these responsible tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.bluewaterhunter.com&quot;/&gt;

The shark tourist industry has some financial leverage in conserving this animal. A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to £20,000. That is a fraction of the tourism value of a live shark; tourism is a more sustainable economic activity than shark fishing. For example, the dive industry in [[Gansbaai]], South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between £50 and £150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between £9,000 and £27,000 of revenue daily.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

== Conservation status ==
It is unclear how much of a concurrent increase in fishing for great white sharks has caused the decline of great white shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the great white shark is now considered vulnerable.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.

The [[IUCN]] notes that very little is known about the actual status of the great white shark, but as it appears uncommon compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; It is included in Appendix II of [[CITES]],&lt;ref name=CITES/&gt; meaning that international trade in the species requires a permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/text.shtml#IV |title=Regulation of Trade in Specimens of Species Included in Appendix II|publisher=CITES (1973)|access-date=8 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717182355/http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/text.shtml#IV |archive-date=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2010, it has also been included in Annex I of the [[Bonn Convention|CMS]] [[Migratory Sharks MoU]], which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks |url=http://www.cms.int/species/sharks/MoU/Migratory_Shark_MoU_Eng.pdf |access-date=31 August 2012 |publisher=Convention on Migratory Species|date=12 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420171816/http://www.cms.int/species/sharks/MoU/Migratory_Shark_MoU_Eng.pdf |archive-date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A February 2010 study by [[Barbara Block]] of [[Stanford University]] estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the [[tiger]], whose population is in the same range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Great white shark is more endangered than tiger, claims scientist |author=Sample, Ian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/19/great-white-shark-endangered-tiger |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 February 2010 |access-date=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another study from 2014 by [[George H.

Fishermen target many sharks for their jaws, teeth, and fins, and as game fish in general. The great white shark, however, is rarely an object of [[commercial fishing]], although its flesh is considered valuable. If casually captured (it happens for example in some [[tonnara|tonnare]] in the [[Mediterranean]]), it is misleadingly sold as ''[[smooth-hound shark]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeMaddalena&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Maddalena |first1=Alessandro |last2=Heim |first2=Walter |title=Mediterranean Great White Sharks: A Comprehensive Study Including All Recorded Sightings |publisher=McFarland |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-7864-5889-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Australia ===
The great white shark was declared vulnerable by the Australian Government in 1999 because of significant population decline and is currently protected under the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999|Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;epbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=64470|title=Species Profile and Threats Database – ''Carcharodon carcharias''—Great White Shark|author=Government of Australia|access-date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of decline prior to protection included mortality from [[sport fishing]] harvests as well as being caught in beach protection netting.&lt;ref name=&quot;au2002&quot;&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/white-shark-carcharodon-carcharias-recovery-plan|title=White Shark (''Carcharodon carcharias'') Recovery Plan|year=2002|author=Environment Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national conservation status of the great white shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws, granting the species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;epbc&quot;/&gt; Many states had prohibited the killing or possession of great white sharks prior to national legislation coming into effect. The great white shark is further listed as threatened in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, and as rare or likely to become extinct under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife Conservation Act in [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;epbc&quot;/&gt;

In 2002, the Australian government created the White Shark Recovery Plan, implementing government-mandated conservation research and monitoring for conservation in addition to federal protection and stronger regulation of shark-related trade and tourism activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;au2002&quot;/&gt; An updated recovery plan was published in 2013 to review progress, research findings, and to implement further conservation actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;au2013&quot;/&gt; A study in 2012 revealed that Australia's white shark population was separated by [[Bass Strait]] into [[population genetics|genetically distinct]] eastern and western populations, indicating a need for the development of regional conservation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blower|first1=Dean C.|last2=Pandolfi|first2=John M.|last3=Bruce|first3=Barry D.|last4=Gomez-Cabrera|first4=Maria del C.|last5=Ovenden|first5=Jennifer R.|year=2012|title=Population genetics of Australian white sharks reveals fine-scale spatial structure, transoceanic dispersal events and low effective population sizes|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=455|pages=229–244|doi=10.3354/meps09659|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, human-caused shark mortality is continuing, primarily from accidental and illegal catching in commercial and recreational fishing as well as from being caught in beach protection netting, and the populations of great white shark in Australia are yet to recover.&lt;ref name=&quot;au2013&quot;/&gt;

In spite of official protections in Australia, great white sharks continue to be killed in state &quot;shark control&quot; programs within Australia. For example, the government of [[Queensland]] has a &quot;shark control&quot; program ([[shark culling]]) which kills great white sharks (as well as other marine life) using [[shark nets]] and [[drum line (shark control)|drum lines with baited hooks]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.seashepherd.org.au/apex-harmony/overview/about-the-campaign.html &quot;About the Campaign: Sea Shepherd Working Together With The Community To Establish Sustainable Solutions To Shark Bite Incidents&quot;.

Retrieved 29 August 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; The government of [[New South Wales]] also kills great white sharks in its &quot;shark control&quot; program.&lt;ref name=&quot;shark_culling&quot;/&gt; Partly because of these programs, shark numbers in eastern Australia have decreased.&lt;ref name=&quot;decline&quot;/&gt;

The Australasian population of great white sharks is believed to be in excess of 8,000–10,000 individuals according to genetic research studies done by [[CSIRO]], with an adult population estimated to be around 2,210 individuals in both Eastern and Western Australia. The annual survival rate for juveniles in these two separate populations was estimated in the same study to be close to 73 percent, while adult sharks had a 93 percent annual survival rate. Whether or not mortality rates in great white sharks have declined, or the population has increased as a result of the protection of this species in Australian waters is as yet unknown due to the slow growth rates of this species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/world-first-genetic-analysis-reveals-aussie-white-shark-numbers-91479|title=World-first genetic analysis reveals Aussie white shark numbers|first1=Rich|last1=Hillary|first2=Russ|last2=Bradford|first3=Toby|last3=Patterson|website=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In New Zealand ===
As of April 2007, great white sharks were fully protected within {{cvt|370|km}} of New Zealand and additionally from fishing by New Zealand-flagged boats outside this range. The maximum penalty is a $250,000 fine and up to six months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10413182|title=Great white sharks to be protected |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=30 November 2006|access-date=30 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018 the New Zealand [[Department of Conservation]] classified the great white shark under the [[New Zealand Threat Classification System]] as &quot;Nationally Endangered&quot;. The species meets the criteria for this classification as there exists a moderate, stable population of between 1000 and 5000 mature individuals. This classification has the qualifiers &quot;Data Poor&quot; and &quot;Threatened Overseas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.doc.govt.nz/globalassets/documents/science-and-technical/nztcs23entire.pdf|title=Conservation status of New Zealand chondrichthyans (chimaeras, sharks and rays), 2016|last1=Duffy|first1=Clinton A.

=== In North America ===
In 2013, great white sharks were added to California's Endangered Species Act. From data collected, the population of great whites in the North Pacific was estimated to be fewer than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these sharks are genetically distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa, Australia, and the east coast of North America, having been isolated from other populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/03/04/great-white-sharks-are-now-protected-under-california-law/ |title=Great White Sharks Are Now Protected under California Law |author=Quan, Kristene |work=Time |date=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study estimated the population of great white sharks along the California coastline to be approximately 2,400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Lauren|title=Shark numbers not tanking|work=Huntington Beach Wave|publisher=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=3 July 2014|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgess|first1=George H.|last2=Bruce|first2=Barry D.|last3=Cailliet|first3=Gregor M.|last4=Goldman|first4=Kenneth J.|last5=Grubbs|first5=R.

In 2015 Massachusetts banned catching, cage diving, feeding, towing decoys, or baiting and chumming for its significant and highly predictable migratory great white population without an appropriate research permit. The goal of these restrictions is to both protect the sharks and public health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dfg/dmf/marinefisheriesnotices/whitesharks.pdf New Regulations Affecting Activity around White Sharks].

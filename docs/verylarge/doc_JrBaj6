Michael made his American acting debut by playing a guardian angel to [[Jonny Lee Miller]]'s character on ''[[Eli Stone]]'', a US TV series. In addition to performing on the show as himself and as &quot;visions&quot;, each episode of the show's first season was named after a song of his. Michael appeared on the 2008 finale show of ''[[American Idol]]'' on 21 May singing &quot;Praying for Time&quot;. When asked what he thought [[Simon Cowell]] would say of his performance, he replied &quot;I think he'll probably tell me I shouldn't have done a George Michael song.

==Personal life==
===Sexuality and relationships===
Michael stated that his early fantasies were about women, which &quot;led me to believe I was on the path to [[heterosexuality]]&quot;, but at puberty he started to fantasise about men, which he later said &quot;had something to do with my environment&quot;. At the age of 19, Michael told Andrew Ridgeley that he was [[bisexual]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gq-magazine.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Jane |url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/men-of-the-year/home/hall-of-fame/george-michael-interview |title=George Michael on beating drugs, depression and his outing in LA – October 2004 |publisher=GQ magazine |date=October 2004 |access-date=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael also told one of his two sisters, but he was advised not to tell his parents about his sexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew Johnson&quot;/&gt; In a 1999 interview with ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', Michael told the Editor in Chief, Judy Wieder, that it was &quot;falling in love with a man that ended his conflict over bisexuality&quot;.
&quot;I never had a moral problem with being [[Homosexuality|gay]]&quot;, Michael told her. &quot;I thought I had fallen in love with a woman a couple of times. Then I fell in love with a man, and realised that none of those things had been love.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wieder&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Celebrity: The Advocate Interviews |last=Wieder|first=Judy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wciFOQAACAAJ |editor-last=Wieder|editor-first=Judy|year=2001|publisher=Advocate Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55583-722-8|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Michael said, &quot;I used to sleep with women quite a lot in the Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a relationship because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want to sleep with a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them.&quot; In the same interview, he added: &quot;If I wasn't with Kenny [his boyfriend at the time], I would have sex with women, no question&quot;. He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was &quot;a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother&quot;, though he stated that &quot;there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gq-magazine.co.uk&quot;/&gt; In 2007 Michael said he had hidden the fact he was gay because of worries over what effect it might have on his mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew Johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Johnson|title=George Michael: Why I had to keep my homosexuality secret|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/george-michael-why-i-had-to-keep-my-homosexuality-secret-403989.html|work=The Independent|location=London|date=30 September 2007|access-date=15 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he added: &quot;My depression at the end of Wham! was because I was beginning to realise I was gay, not bisexual.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/george-michael-an-exclusi_b_157401.html|title=Johann Hari: George Michael: An Exclusive Interview|work=The Huffington Post|date=13 January 2009|access-date=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1980s, Michael had a relationship with make-up artist Kathy Jeung, who was regarded for a time as his artistic &quot;muse&quot; and who appeared in the &quot;[[I Want Your Sex]]&quot; video.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-38432981 George Michael: Six songs that defined his life], BBC, 26 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Michael later said that she had been his &quot;only bona fide&quot; girlfriend, and that she knew of his bisexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;gq-magazine.co.uk&quot;/&gt; In 2016 Jeung reacted to Michael's death by calling him a &quot;true friend&quot; with whom she had spent &quot;some of the best time of [her] life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7633328/george-michael-dead-music-video-women-memories-photos George Michael's Leading Ladies Share Memories, Photos of '90s Video Heyday], ''Billboard.com'', 26 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Michael established a relationship with Anselmo Feleppa, a Brazilian dress designer who he had met at the [[Rock in Rio]] concert in 1991. Six months into their relationship, Feleppa discovered that he was [[HIV/AIDS|HIV-positive]]. Michael later said: &quot;It was terrifying news. I thought I could have the disease too.

After pleading &quot;[[Nolo contendere|no contest]]&quot; to the charge, Michael was fined US$810 and sentenced to 80 hours of [[community service]]. Soon afterwards, Michael made a video for his single &quot;[[Outside (George Michael song)|Outside]]&quot;, which satirised the public toilet incident and featured men dressed as policemen kissing. Rodríguez claimed that this video &quot;mocked&quot; him, and that Michael had slandered him in interviews. In 1999, he brought a US$10&amp;nbsp;million court case in California against the singer. The court dismissed the case, but an [[appellate court]] reinstated it on 3 December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.

Following his death, many charities revealed that Michael had privately been a supporter of them for many years.

The '''grandfather paradox''' is a [[paradox]] of [[time travel]] in which inconsistencies emerge through changing the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;lobo&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Time, Closed Timelike Curves and Causality |author=Francisco Lobo |journal=Nato Sci.ser.ii |year=2003 |volume=95 |pages=289–296 |arxiv=gr-qc/0206078 |bibcode=2003ntgp.conf..289L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the paradox's common description: a person travels to the past and kills their own grandfather before the conception of their father or mother, which prevents the time traveller's existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;sagan-nova&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/time/sagan.html |title=Carl Sagan Ponders Time Travel|work=NOVA|date=December 10, 1999|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its title, the grandfather paradox does not exclusively regard the contradiction of killing one's own grandfather to prevent one's birth.

The grandfather paradox was mentioned in written stories as early as 1929. In 1931, it was described as &quot;the age-old argument of preventing your birth by killing your grandparents&quot; in a letter to American [[science fiction]] magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=39KQY1FnSfkC|title=Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction| last1= Nahin|first1=Paul J.|date=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=0387985719|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=255, 286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early science-fiction stories dealing with the paradox are the short story ''Ancestral Voices'' by [[Nathaniel Schachner]], published in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginn|first1=Sherry|last2=Leach|first2=Gillian I.|title=Time-Travel Television: The Past from the Present, the Future from the Past|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=London|isbn=978-1442255777|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1944 book ''[[Future Times Three]]'' by [[René Barjavel]], although a number of other works from the 1930s and 1940s touched upon the topic in various degrees of detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

As a Hollywood star, he appeared in almost 100 films over the course of 60 years. He played [[Moses]] in the [[epic film]] ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), for which he received his first nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlton Heston|url=http://www.hfpa.org/browse/?param=/member/28565|website=[[Golden Globe Award]]s Official Website|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also starred in ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1952), ''[[Secret of the Incas]]'' (1954), ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958) with [[Orson Welles]], ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), for which he won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961), ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965), ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968), ''[[The Omega Man]]'' (1971) and ''[[Soylent Green]]'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;Emilie Raymond, ''From My Cold, Dead Hands: Charlton Heston and American Politics'', (2006), pp 4–5, 33&lt;!-- publishing info; ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, he was one of a handful of Hollywood actors to speak openly against racism, and was an active supporter of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Heston left the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in 1971 to become a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], founding a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[political action committee]] and supporting [[Ronald Reagan]]. Heston was a five-term president of the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA), from 1998 to 2003. After announcing he had [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 2002, he retired from both acting and the NRA presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/morford/article/Charlton-Heston-s-Last-Sneer-The-NRA-retires-2619608.php &quot;Charlton Heston's Last Sneer&quot;], SFGate.com, April 30, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
John Charles Carter&lt;ref name=&quot;eliot&quot;/&gt; was born on October 4, 1923, in [[Wilmette, Illinois]], to Lilla (''[[Given name|née]]'' Baines; 1899&amp;ndash;1994) and Russell Whitford Carter (1897&amp;ndash;1966), a [[sawmill]] operator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/81/Charlton-Heston.html Biography], Filmreference.com; retrieved November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1900 United States Census; Cook County, Chicago, Illinois, United States.&lt;/ref&gt; Many sources indicate he was born in [[Evanston, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2008/04/9017/heston-at-northwestern|title=Appreciation: Charlton Heston's life as a Wildcat|accessdate=March 18, 2010|last=Werling|first=Karen|date=April 16, 2008|website=North by Northwestern|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930152521/http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2008/04/9017/heston-at-northwestern/|archive-date=September 30, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Berkvist|title=Charlton Heston, Epic Film Star and Voice of N.R.A., Dies at 84|date=April 6, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/movies/06heston.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Charlton-Heston-9337556|title=Charlton Heston Biography|date=March 18, 2010|website=biography.com|accessdate=December 11, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924201149/http://www.biography.com/articles/Charlton-Heston-9337556|archivedate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heston's autobiography stated otherwise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arena&quot;&gt;Heston, Charlton: ''In The Arena'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995; {{ISBN|0-684-80394-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heston said in a 1995 interview that he was not very good at remembering addresses or his early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charltonhestonworld.homestead.com/ChuckInterviews.html|title=Appreciation: Charlton Heston's Interview, Articles &amp; Tribute|accessdate=March 18, 2010|last=Schultz|first=Rick|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heston was partially of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, including from the Clan Fraser, but the majority of his ancestry was [[English people|English]].

Roberts, David Curtis Dearborn, John Anderson Brayton, Richard E. Brenneman, New England Historic Genealogical Society, Carl Boyer, 1997 page 21&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal great-grandparents, and namesakes, were Englishman William Charlton from [[Sunderland]] and Scotswoman Mary Drysdale Charlton. They emigrated to Canada, where his grandmother, Marian Emily Charlton, was born in 1872.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The 1880 United States Census; Chicago, Cook County, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Heston refers to his father participating in his family's construction business. When Heston was an infant, his father's work moved the family to [[St. Helen, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mybaycity.com/scripts/Article_View.cfm?ArticleID=1037&amp;NewspaperID=0 My Bay City article, February 5, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118075401/http://www.mybaycity.com/scripts/Article_View.cfm?ArticleID=1037&amp;NewspaperID=0|date=November 18, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a rural, heavily forested part of the state, and Heston lived an isolated yet idyllic existence, spending much time hunting and fishing in the backwoods of the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arena&quot;/&gt;

When Heston was 10 years old, his parents divorced after having three children. Shortly thereafter, his mother remarried and Charlton and his younger sister Lilla and brother Alan moved to [[Wilmette, Illinois]]. Heston (his and his siblings' new surname) attended [[New Trier High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Habermehl|first=Kris|date=January 25, 2007|title=Fire Breaks Out At Prestigious High School|url=http://cbs2chicago.com/local/New.Trier.High.2.334860.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031074406/http://cbs2chicago.com/local/New.Trier.High.2.334860.html|archivedate=October 31, 2007|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled living there:{{Quote|All kids play pretend games, but I did it more than most.

''The Actor's Life'', E.P. Dutton, New York (1976)&lt;!-- ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xii}}}}

Contradictions on paper and in an interview surround when &quot;Charlton&quot; became Heston's first name. The [[1930 United States Census]] record for [[Richfield Township, Roscommon County, Michigan|Richfield, Michigan]], in [[Roscommon County, Michigan|Roscommon County]], shows his name as being Charlton J. Carter at age six. Later accounts and movie studio biographies say he was born John Charles Carter. When Russell Carter died in 1966, Charlton's brother and sister changed their legal surname to Heston the following year; Charlton did not.&lt;ref name=&quot;eliot&quot; /&gt;

Charlton was his maternal grandmother Marian's maiden name,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; not his mother Lilla's. This is contrary to how 20th century references read and what Heston said. When Heston's maternal grandmother and his true maternal grandfather Charles Baines&lt;ref&gt;The 1900 United States Census; Chicago, Cook County, Illinois{{better source|date=February 2019|reason=Is that a published source?}}&lt;/ref&gt; separated or divorced in the early 1900s, Marian (''[[Given name|née]]'' Charlton) Baines married William Henry Lawton in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Cook County, Illinois Marriages Index, 1871–1920{{better source|date=February 2019|reason=Is that a published source?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlton Heston's mother, Lilla, and her sister May were adopted by their grandfather, and changed their last name to Charlton in order to distance themselves from their biological father, Mr. Baines, who was an undesirable father figure.&lt;ref&gt;Cook County, Illinois Marriage Indexes, 1912–1942.{{better source|date=February 2019|reason=Is that a published source?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1920 United States Census; Chicago, Cook County, Illinois.{{better source|date=February 2019|reason=Is that a published source?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carters divorced in 1933 and Lilla Carter married Chester Heston. The newly married Mrs. Heston preferred her children use the same last name as her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Raymond|first=Emile|year=2006|title=From My Cold, Dead Hands: Charlton Heston and American Politics|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|page=321|isbn=978-0813171494}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 11, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was thus as Charlton Heston that he appeared in his first film with younger brother Alan Carter (small role), an adaptation of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' (1941).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Staff|title=AFI Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iijusBRcwv4C&amp;q=heston%20peer%20gynt%201941&amp;pg=PA323|publisher=University of California Press|page=323|date=1999|isbn=978-0520215214|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nickname was always Chuck.

Heston was an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]], and has been described as &quot;a spiritual man&quot; with an &quot;earthy flair&quot;, who &quot;respected religious traditions&quot; and &quot;particularly enjoyed the historical aspects of the Christian faith&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tujw3ajlDMC&amp;q=charlton%20heston%20episcopalian&amp;pg=PA44|title=From My Cold, Dead Hands: Charlton Heston and American Politics|last=Raymond|first=Emilie|date=2006-08-18|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0813171494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Heston frequently recounted that while growing up in northern [[Michigan]] in a sparsely populated area, he often wandered in the forest, &quot;acting&quot; out characters from books he had read.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=319357 Private Screenings: Charlton Heston (1998)]. Tcm.com; retrieved November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in high school, he enrolled in New Trier's drama program, playing the lead role in the amateur silent [[16 mm film]] adaptation of ''Peer Gynt'', from the [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] [[Peer Gynt|play]], by future film activist [[David Bradley (director)|David Bradley]] released in 1941.

From the Winnetka Community Theatre (or the Winnetka Dramatist's Guild, as it was then known) in which he was active, he earned a drama scholarship to [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Krause&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Northwestern (magazine)|accessdate=December 2, 2013|title=New Theater Honors Alvina Krause|date=Spring 2010|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/spring2010/campuslife/krausestudio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 15, 2004|title=Ms. Alvina Krause|first=James|last=Goode|accessdate=December 2, 2013|url=http://library.bloomu.edu/Archives/SC/BTE/alvinakrause.htm|publisher=[[Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania]]}} Please see also {{URL|http://www.bte.org/alvina-krause}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended college from 1941 to 1943 and among his acting teachers was [[Alvina Krause]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Krause&quot;/&gt;  Several years later, Heston teamed up with Bradley to produce the first sound version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]'', in which Heston played [[Mark Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Brode | first= Douglas | date=April 27, 2000 | location=Oxford | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | page=102 | title=Shakespeare in the Movies: From the Silent Era to Shakespeare in Love | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ky-hEnhihkkC&amp;pg=PA102 | accessdate=April 3, 2018 | isbn=978-0-199-72802-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II service===
In March 1944 Heston married [[Northwestern University]] student [[Lydia Clarke|Lydia Marie Clarke]] at Grace Methodist Church in downtown [[Greensboro, North Carolina]].

After the war, the Hestons lived in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], New York City, where they worked as artists' models. Seeking a way to make it in theatre, they decided to manage a playhouse in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], in 1947, making $100 a week.

In 1948, they returned to New York, where Heston was offered a supporting role in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of Shakespeare's ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', starring [[Katharine Cornell]]. In television, Heston played a number of roles in CBS's ''[[Studio One (anthology series)|Studio One]]'', one of the most popular anthology dramas of the 1950s.

In 1949 Heston played [[Mark Antony]] in a televised production of ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1950).

Film producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' spotted Heston in a 1950 television production of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' and offered him a contract. When his wife reminded Heston they had decided to pursue theater and television, he replied, &quot;Well, maybe just for one film to see what it's like.&quot;

===Hollywood===
Heston's first professional movie appearance was the leading role at age 26 in ''[[Dark City (1950 film)|Dark City]]'', a 1950 [[film noir]] produced by Hal Wallis. His breakthrough came when [[Cecil B. DeMille]] cast him as a circus manager in ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', which was named by the Motion Picture Academy as the Best Picture of 1952. It was also the most popular movie of that year.

[[File:Heston-Jurado-Arrowhead.jpg|thumb|left|Heston with [[Katy Jurado]] in ''[[Arrowhead (1953 film)|Arrowhead]]'' (1953)]]
[[King Vidor]] used Heston in a melodrama with [[Jennifer Jones]], ''[[Ruby Gentry]]'' (1952). He followed it with a Western at Paramount, ''[[The Savage (1952 film)|The Savage]]'' (1952), playing a white man raised by Indians. [[20th Century Fox]] used him to play [[Andrew Jackson]] in ''[[The President's Lady]]'' (1953) opposite [[Susan Hayward]]. Back at Paramount he was [[Buffalo Bill]] in ''[[Pony Express (film)|Pony Express]]'' (1953). He followed this with another Western, ''[[Arrowhead (1953 film)|Arrowhead]]'' (1953).

In 1953, Heston was [[Billy Wilder]]'s first choice to play Sefton in ''[[Stalag 17]]''. However, the role was given to [[William Holden]], who won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] for it. Hal Wallis reunited Heston with [[Lizabeth Scott]] in a melodrama ''[[Bad for Each Other]]'' (1953).

In 1954, he made two adventure films for Paramount. ''[[The Naked Jungle]]'' had him battle a plague of killer ants. He played the lead in ''[[Secret of the Incas]]'', which was shot on location at the archeological site [[Machu Picchu]] and has numerous similarities to ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.

Heston played William Clark, the explorer, in ''[[The Far Horizons]]'' (1955) alongside [[Fred MacMurray]]. He tried a comedy ''[[The Private War of Major Benson]]'' (1955) at Universal, then supported [[Jane Wyman]] in a drama ''[[Lucy Gallant]]'' (1955).

===''The Ten Commandments''===

[[File:Touch-of-Evil-1851-26.jpg|thumb|[[Orson Welles]], [[Victor Millan]], [[Joseph Calleia]] and Heston in ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958)]]
Heston became an icon for playing [[Moses]] in the hugely successful biblical epic ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), selected by director Cecil B. DeMille, who thought Heston bore an uncanny resemblance to [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Moses (Michelangelo)|statue of Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orrison|first1=Katherine|authorlink1=Katherine Orrison|title=Written in Stone: Making Cecil B.

''The Ten Commandments'' became one of the greatest box office successes of all time and is [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation|the seventh highest-grossing film adjusted for inflation]]. His portrayal of the Hebrew prophet and deliverer was praised by film critics. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described him as &quot;splendid, handsome and princely (and human) in the scenes dealing with him as a young man, and majestic and terrible as his role demands it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='The Ten Commandments': Read THR's 1956 Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ten-commandments-1956-movie-review-754677|accessdate=22 August 2017|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 5, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' wrote that he &quot;is remarkably effective as both the young, princely Moses and as the Patriarchal savior of his people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flashback: Original 1956 review of 'The Ten Commandments' in the Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/flashback-stars-ten-commandment-article-1.2040699|accessdate=22 August 2017|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 9, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance as Moses earned him his first nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama]] and Spain's Fotogramas de Plata Award for Best Foreign Performer. The Egyptian Theater made its second debut in December 1998, with a screening of Cecil B. DeMille's 1923 original The Ten Commandments, which premiered at the Egyptian 75 years earlier. Charlton and Lydia Heston were honored guests and their longtime friends brothers Charles Elias Disney and Daniel H. Disney were seated with the Heston's for this opening showing in the Egyptian Theatre.

Heston went back to Westerns with ''[[Three Violent People]]'' (1957). Universal tried to interest him in a thriller starring [[Orson Welles]], ''[[Touch of Evil]]''; Heston agreed to be in it if Welles directed. The film has come to be regarded as a classic masterpiece. He also played a rare supporting role in [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[The Big Country]]'' opposite [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Burl Ives]].

Heston got another chance to play [[Andrew Jackson]] in ''[[The Buccaneer (1958 film)|The Buccaneer]]'' (1958), produced by De Mille and starring [[Yul Brynner]].

===''Ben Hur''===
[[File:Charlton Heston in Ben Hur trailer.jpg|left|thumb|Heston in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959)]]
After [[Marlon Brando]], [[Burt Lancaster]], and [[Rock Hudson]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bobthomas&quot;/&gt; turned down the title role in [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|''Ben-Hur'']] (1959), Heston accepted the role, winning the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], one of the unprecedented 11 Oscars the film earned. After Moses and ''Ben-Hur'', Heston became more identified with Biblical epics than any other actor. He later voiced Ben-Hur in an [[Ben Hur (2003 film)|animated television production]] of the [[Lew Wallace]] [[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|novel]] in 2003.

Heston followed it with ''[[The Wreck of the Mary Deare (film)|The Wreck of the Mary Deare]]'' (1959) co-starring [[Gary Cooper]], which was a box office disappointment.

Heston turned down the lead opposite [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Let's Make Love]]'' to appear in [[Benn W. Levy]]'s play ''The Tumbler'', directed by [[Laurence Olivier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rovin|first=Jeff|title=The Films of Charlton Heston|year=1977|publisher=Lyle Stuart|location=New York|isbn=978-0806505619|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Called a &quot;harrowingly pretentious verse drama&quot; by [[Time Magazine|''Time'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Theater: New Plays on Broadway|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894730,00.html#ixzz2bV2R26xx|magazine=Time Magazine|accessdate=August 9, 2013|date=March 7, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; the production went through a troubled out-of-town tryout period in Boston and closed after five performances on Broadway in February 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tumbler|url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=2099|publisher=Internet Broadway Database|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heston, a great admirer of Olivier the actor, took on the play to work with him as a director. After the play flopped, Heston told columnist Joe Hyams, &quot;I feel I am the only one who came out with a profit.... I got out of it precisely what I went in for – a chance to work with Olivier. I learned from him in six weeks things I never would have learned otherwise. I think I've ended up a better actor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hyams|first=Joe|title=Heston Not Hurt By Flop Play|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19600303&amp;id=xggwAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7322,6153850|accessdate=August 9, 2013|newspaper=Toledo Blade|date=March 3, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heston enjoyed acting on stage, believing it revivified him as an actor. He never returned to Broadway, but acted in regional theatres. His most frequent stage roles included the title role in ''[[Macbeth]]'', and Mark Antony in both ''Julius Caesar'' and ''Antony and Cleopatra''.{{citation needed||reason=When, where, for whom?|date=December 2013}} He played Sir [[Thomas More]] in ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'' in several regional productions in the 1970s and 1980s, eventually playing it in [[London's West End]]. The play was a success and the West End production was taken to [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, for a week, where it was staged at [[His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen|His Majesty's Theatre]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[Samuel Bronston]] pursued Heston to play the title role in an epic shot in Spain, ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961), which was a big success. He was in a war film for Paramount, ''[[The Pigeon That Took Rome]]'' (1962), and a melodrama shot in Hawaii, ''[[Diamond Head (film)|Diamond Head]]'' (1963). Bronston wanted him for another epic and the result was ''[[55 Days at Peking]]'' (1963), which was a box office disappointment.

Heston focused on epics: he was [[John the Baptist]] in ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965); [[Michelangelo]] in ''[[The Agony and the Ecstasy (film)|The Agony and the Ecstasy]]'' (1965) opposite [[Rex Harrison]]; the title role in ''[[Major Dundee]]'' (1965), directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]]. ''[[The War Lord]]'' (1965), directed by [[Franklin J. Schaffner]], was on a smaller scale and critically acclaimed, though commercially it fared poorly. In ''[[Khartoum (film)|Khartoum]]'' (1966) Heston played [[General Charles Gordon]].

From 1965 until 1971, Heston served as president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]]. The Guild had been created in 1933 for the benefit of actors, who had different interests from the producers and directors who controlled the [[Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences]]. He was more conservative than most actors, and publicly clashed with outspoken liberal actors such as [[Ed Asner]].&lt;ref&gt;Emilie Raymond, &quot;The Agony and the Ecstasy: Charlton Heston and the Screen Actors Guild&quot;, ''Journal of Policy History'' (2005) 17#2, pp 217–39.&lt;!--ISBN/ISSN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Counterpoint (1968 film)|Counterpoint]]'' (1968) was a war film which was not particularly successful at the box office. Neither was the Western ''[[Will Penny]]'' (1968), directed by [[Tom Gries]]; however Heston received excellent reviews and it was one of his favorite films.

===''Planet of the Apes''===
Heston had not been in a big hit for a number of years but in 1968 he starred in ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', directed by Schaffner, which was hugely popular. Less so was a football drama, ''[[Number One (1969 film)|Number One]]'' (1969) directed by Gries. Heston had a smaller supporting role in ''[[Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]'' (1970), which was popular. However, ''[[The Hawaiians (film)|The Hawaiians]]'' (1970), directed by Gries, was not.

In 1970, he portrayed Mark Antony again in another [[Julius Caesar (1970 film)|film version]] of Shakespeare's '' Julius Caesar''. His co-stars included [[Jason Robards]] as Brutus, [[Richard Chamberlain]] as Octavius, [[Robert Vaughn]] as Casca, and English actors [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] as Cassius, [[John Gielgud]] as Caesar, and [[Diana Rigg]] as Portia.

===1970s action star===
In 1971, he starred in the post-apocalyptic science-fiction film ''[[The Omega Man]]'', which has received mixed critical reviews but was popular. During this time he became a gun rights advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/omega_man/ |title=The Omega Man |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Heston made his directorial debut and starred as Mark Antony in an adaptation of the William Shakespeare play he had performed earlier in his theater career, ''[[Antony and Cleopatra (1972 film)|Antony and Cleopatra]]''. [[Hildegarde Neil]] was Cleopatra and English actor [[Eric Porter]] was [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC)|Ahenobarbus]]. After receiving scathing reviews, the film was never released to theaters, and is rarely seen on television. It was finally released on DVD in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H0M31I Antony &amp; Cleopatra: Movies &amp; TV]. Amazon.com. Retrieved on November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

His next film, ''[[Skyjacked (film)|Skyjacked]]'' (1972) was a hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skyjacked (1972)|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/31483%7C0/Skyjacked.html|author=Soares, Emily|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM)|website=TCM.com|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However ''[[The Call of the Wild (1972 film)|The Call of the Wild]]'' (1972) was a flop, one of Heston's least favorite films. He quickly recovered with a string of hits: ''[[Soylent Green]]'' (1973), another science fiction story; ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 live-action film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1973), playing [[Cardinal Richelieu]] in an all-star cast; ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974), a disaster film; ''[[Airport 1975]]'' (1975), another disaster film; ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' (1976) a war film.

Heston's good run at the box office ended with ''[[Two-Minute Warning]]'' (1976), a disaster film, and ''[[The Last Hard Men (film)|The Last Hard Men]]'' (1976), a Western. He played [[King Henry VIII]] for ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1977 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'' (1977), from the ''Musketeers'' team, then starred in a disaster film, ''[[Gray Lady Down]]'' (1978).

Heston was in a Western written by his son, ''[[The Mountain Men]]'' (1980), and a horror film, ''[[The Awakening (1980 film)|The Awakening]]'' (1980). He made his second film as a director ''[[Mother Lode (film)|Mother Lode]]'' (1982) also written by his son; it was a commercial disappointment.

===Later career===
From 1985 until 1987, he starred in his only prime time stint on a television series in the soap, ''[[The Colbys]]''. With his son Fraser, he produced and starred in several TV movies, including remakes of ''[[Treasure Island (1990 film)|Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1988 film)|A Man For All Seasons]]''. In 1992, Heston appeared on the [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E cable network]] in a short series of videos, ''Charlton Heston Presents the [[Bible]]'', reading passages from the [[Authorized Version|King James version]].

In 1993, Heston teamed up with [[John Anthony West]] and [[Robert M. Schoch]] in an [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[NBC]] special, ''[[The Mystery of the Sphinx]]''. West and Schoch had proposed a much earlier date for the construction of the [[Great Sphinx]] than the one which is generally accepted. They had suggested that the main type of [[weathering]] evident on the Great Sphinx and surrounding enclosure walls could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall and that the whole structure was carved out of [[limestone]] bedrock by an ancient advanced culture (such as the [[Heavy Neolithic]] [[Qaraoun culture]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Schoch (1992)&quot;&gt;Schoch, Robert M.

Never taking himself too seriously, he also made a few appearances as &quot;Chuck&quot; in [[Dame Edna Everage]]'s shows, both on stage and on television. Heston appeared in 1993 in a cameo role in ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'', in a scene where Wayne Campbell ([[Mike Myers]]) requests casting a better actor for a small role. After the scene is reshot with Heston, Campbell weeps in awe. That same year, Heston hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. He had cameos in the films ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'', ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''.

He starred in many theatre productions at the [[Los Angeles Music Center]], where he appeared in ''[[Detective Story (play)|Detective Story]]'' and ''[[The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial]]'', and as [[Sherlock Holmes]] in ''[[The Crucifer of Blood]]'', opposite [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] as [[Dr. Watson]]. In 2001, he made a cameo appearance as an elderly, dying chimpanzee in [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|remake of ''Planet of the Apes'']]. His last film role was as [[Josef Mengele]] in ''[[Rua Alguem 5555: My Father]]'', which had limited release (mainly to festivals) in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cockrell|first=Eddie|title=My Father Rua Alguem 5555|date=12 February 2004|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/my-father-rua-alguem-5555-1200536498/|accessdate=3 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

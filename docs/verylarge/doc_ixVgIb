Humphrey ran for [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Majority Leader]] after the 1976 election but lost to [[Robert Byrd]] of [[West Virginia]]. The Senate honored Humphrey by creating the post of [[Deputy President pro tempore of the United States Senate|Deputy President pro tempore]] of the Senate for him. On August 16, 1977, Humphrey revealed he was suffering from terminal [[bladder cancer]]. On October 25 of that year, he addressed the Senate, and on November 3, Humphrey became the first person other than a member of the House or the President of the United States to address the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in session.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, pp. 478–479.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter]] honored him by giving him command of [[Air Force One]] for his final trip to Washington on October 23. One of Humphrey's final speeches contained the lines &quot;It was once said that the moral test of Government is how that Government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped&quot;, which is sometimes described as the &quot;liberals' mantra&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-03/news/vw-2284_1_single-source)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and funeral==
[[File:HumphreyGrave.jpg|thumb|Burial plot of Hubert and Muriel Humphrey at [[Lakewood Cemetery]] in [[Minneapolis]]]]
Humphrey spent his last weeks calling old political acquaintances. One call was to [[Richard Nixon]] inviting him to his upcoming funeral, which Nixon accepted. Staying in the hospital, Humphrey went from room to room, cheering up other patients by telling them jokes and listening to them. On January 13, 1978, he died of bladder cancer at his home in [[Waverly, Minnesota]], at the age of 66.

Humphrey's body [[Lying in state#United States|lay in state]] in the [[United States Capitol rotunda|rotundas of the U.S. Capitol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/lying-state-honor |title= Lying in State or in Honor |publisher=US Architect of the Capitol (AOC) |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Minnesota State Capitol]] before being interred at [[Lakewood Cemetery]] in Minneapolis. His passing overshadowed the death of his colleague from [[Montana]], Senator [[Lee Metcalf]], who had died the day before Humphrey. Old friends and opponents of Humphrey, from Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon to President Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale, paid their final respects. &quot;He taught us how to live, and finally he taught us how to die&quot;, said Mondale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1978/Hubert-Humphrey-Dies/12309251197005-7/|title=Hubert Humphrey Dies – Events of 1978 – Year in Review|agency=United Press International|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humphrey's wife Muriel was appointed by Minnesota governor [[Rudy Perpich]] to serve in the U.S. Senate until a special election to fill the term was held; she did not seek election to finish her husband's term in office. In 1981 she married Max Brown and took the name Muriel Humphrey Brown.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Barbara Kleban, &quot;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20078617,00.html A Childhood Friendship Turns to Love, and Muriel Humphrey Plans to Be Married]&quot;, ''People'', February 16, 1981, Vol. 15 No. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her death in 1998 she was interred next to Humphrey at Lakewood Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mooar, 1998&quot;/&gt;

In 1978, Humphrey received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|title=National – Jefferson Awards Foundation|access-date=August 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124043935/http://jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|archive-date=November 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded posthumously the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] on June 13, 1979 and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1980.

He was honored by the [[United States Postal Service]] with a 52¢ [[Great Americans series]] (1980–2000) postage stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2037019|title=52-cent Humphrey|publisher=arago.si.edu|date=June 27, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandra Day O'Connor''' (born March 26, 1930) is a retired attorney, politician, and the first woman [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]], a position she held from 1981 until her retirement in 2006. She was the first woman nominated and confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weisman |first=Steven R. |date=July 7, 1981 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0707.html |title=Reagan Nominating Woman, an Arizona Appeals Judge, to Serve on Supreme Court |work=The New York Times |access-date=September 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominated by President [[Ronald Reagan]], she was considered the [[swing vote]] for the [[Rehnquist Court]] and the beginning of the [[Roberts Court]].

Prior to O'Connor's tenure on the Court, she was a judge and an elected official in [[Arizona]], serving as the first female majority leader of a state senate as the Republican leader in the [[Arizona Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=O'Connor, Sandra Day |publisher=[[Federal Judicial Center]] |url=http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=1796 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040306042155/http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=1796 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 6, 2004 |access-date=March 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her nomination to the Court, O'Connor was confirmed unanimously by the Senate.

As a [[Rockefeller Republican|moderate Republican]], O'Connor tended to approach each case narrowly without seeking to establish sweeping precedents. She most frequently sided with the Court's conservative bloc. She often wrote concurring opinions that limited the reach of the majority holding. Her majority opinions in landmark cases include ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'' and ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]''. She also wrote in part the ''[[per curiam]]'' majority opinion in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', and was one of three co-authors of the lead opinion in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]''.

During her time on the court, some publications ranked O'Connor among the most powerful women in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=John |last=McCaslin |title=Power Women |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JohnMcCaslin/2001/11/07/mccaslins_beltway_beat |work=McCaslin's Beltway Beat |publisher=[[Townhall.com]] |location=Washington, D.C. |date=November 7, 2001 |access-date=June 15, 2009 |quote= ...

Gemma called the nomination &quot;a direct contradiction of the Republican [[Party platform|platform]] to everything that candidate Reagan said and even President Reagan has said in regard to social issues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1981/0708/070837.html|title=A closer look at nation's first woman high court nominee|author=Julia Malone|date=July 8, 1981|newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|access-date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gemma, the executive director of the [[United States pro-life movement|National Pro-Life Political Action Committee]], had sought to delay O'Connor's confirmation by challenging her record, including support for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1981/0903/090343.html|title=New Right strategy: let's drag out O'Connor's confirmation hearing; Focus: abortion, women's rights, school prayer|date=September 3, 1981|author=Julia Malone|newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|access-date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Connor's confirmation hearing before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] began on September 9, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/10/us/o-connor-hearings-open-on-a-note-of-friendship.html|title=O'Connor Hearings Open on a Note of Friendship|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|date=September 10, 1981|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 20, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first televised confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.c-span.org/camerasInTheCourt/timeline.html|title=Cameras in the Court|website=c-span.org|access-date=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confirmation hearing lasted three days and largely focused on the issue of abortion.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/16/us/panel-approves-judge-o-connor.html|title=Panel Approves Judge O'Connor|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda |date=September 16, 1981|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 20, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked, O'Connor refused to telegraph her views on abortion, and she was careful not to leave the impression that she supported [[pro-choice|abortion rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greenburg|2007|pp=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Judiciary Committee approved O'Connor with seventeen votes in favor and one vote of present.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

On September 21, O'Connor was confirmed by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] with a vote of 99–0;&lt;ref name=&quot;UPI-1981-Review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reagan's Nomination of O'Connor|url = https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/oconnor.html|publisher = archives.gov|access-date = November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Max Baucus]] of Montana was absent from the vote, and sent O'Connor a copy of ''[[A River Runs Through It (novel)|A River Runs Through It]]'' by way of apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowe|first=Rebecca|title=Supremely confident: the legacy of Sandra Day O'Connor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/aug/30/us-supreme-court-george-bush|work=The Guardian|date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her first year on the Court she received over 60,000 letters from the public, more than any other justice in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8433188/ns/us_news-the_changing_court/t/sandra-day-oconnor-reluctant-justice/|title=Sandra Day O'Connor: The reluctant justice|last=Associated Press|date=July 1, 2005|work=nbc.com|access-date=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tenure ===
O'Connor has said she felt a responsibility to demonstrate women could do the job of justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;freshair&quot; /&gt; She faced some practical concerns, including the lack of a woman's restroom near the Courtroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;freshair&quot; /&gt;

Two years after O'Connor joined the Court, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an editorial which mentioned the &quot;nine men&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/29/opinion/topics-in-the-name-of-the-law-legal-abc-s.html|title=Topics: In the Name of the LawOPICS: Legal ABC's|date=September 29, 1983|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 22, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the &quot;SCOTUS&quot;, or Supreme Court of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; O'Connor responded with a letter to the editor reminding the ''Times'' that the Court was no longer composed of nine men and referred to herself as FWOTSC (First Woman On The Supreme Court).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/opinion/l-high-court-s-9-men-were-a-surprise-to-one-225413.html|title=High Court's '9 Men' Were a Surprise to One|date=October 12, 1983|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 19, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Connor was a proponent of collegiality among justices on the court, often insisting that the justices eat lunch together.&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot; /&gt;

In 1993, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] became the second female Supreme Court justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/03/15/693542112/from-triumph-to-tragedy-first-tells-story-of-justice-sandra-day-oconnor|title=From Triumph To Tragedy, 'First' Tells Story Of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor|last=Totenberg|first=Nina|date=March 15, 2019|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=February 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor said she felt relief from the media clamor when she was no longer the only woman on the court.&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?57167-1/women-bench|title=Women on the Bench {{!}} C-SPAN.org|website=www.c-span.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, O'Connor warned female Supreme Court nominee [[Elena Kagan]] about the &quot;unpleasant&quot; process of confirmation hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/sandra-day-oconnor-cautions-elena-kagan-dreadful-nomination/story?id=10754455|title=Retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor Backs Elena Kagan Nomination|last=Clarke|first=Suzan|date=May 27, 2010|publisher=[[ABC News]]|access-date=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court jurisprudence===

[[File:O'ConnorGonzalesCloseUp.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Justice O'Connor presents [[Alberto Gonzales]] to the audience after swearing him in as [[U.S. Attorney General]], as Becky Gonzales looks on.]]
Initially, O'Connor's voting record aligned closely with the conservative [[William Rehnquist]] (voting with him 87% of the time her first three years at the Court).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greenburg|2007|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time until 1998, O'Connor's alignment with Rehnquist ranged from 93.4% to 63.2%, hitting above 90% in three of those years.&lt;ref name=&quot;la times&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Herman |date=April 12, 1998 |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/12/opinion/op-38686 |title=O'Connor as a 'Centrist'? Not When Minorities Are Involved |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In nine of her first sixteen years on the Court, O'Connor voted with Rehnquist more than with any other justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;la times&quot;/&gt;

Later on, as the Court's make-up became more conservative (e.g., [[Anthony Kennedy]] replacing [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]], and [[Clarence Thomas]] replacing [[Thurgood Marshall]]), O'Connor often became the [[swing vote]] on the Court. However, she usually disappointed the Court's more liberal bloc in contentious 5–4 decisions: from 1994 to 2004, she joined the traditional conservative bloc of Rehnquist, [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], and Thomas 82 times; she joined the liberal bloc of [[John Paul Stevens]], [[David Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer]] only 28 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/118/Nov04/Nine_Justices_Ten_YearsFTX.pdf |title=Nine Justices, Ten Years: A Statistical Retrospective |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume= 118 |number=1 |page=521 |date=November 2004 |access-date=August 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327053526/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/118/Nov04/Nine_Justices_Ten_YearsFTX.pdf |archive-date=March 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Connor's relatively small&lt;ref name=&quot;wash post&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A14368-2004Oct31.html |title=Justices Too Tightlipped on Their Health? |first=Charles |last=Lane |date=November 1, 2004 |page= A19  |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=December 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; shift away from conservatives on the Court seems to have been due at least in part to Thomas's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greenburg|2007|pp=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Thomas and O'Connor were voting on the same side, she would typically write a separate opinion of her own, refusing to join his.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greenburg|2007|pp=123, 134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1992 term, O'Connor did not join a single one of Thomas' dissents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greenburg|2007|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable cases in which O'Connor joined the majority in a 5–4 decision were:
* ''[[McConnell v. FEC]]'', {{ussc|540|93|2003}}, upholding the constitutionality of most of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|McCain-Feingold campaign-finance bill]] regulating &quot;[[Campaign finance in the United States#Hard money and soft money|soft money]]&quot; contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/cases-which-sandra-day-oconnor-cast-decisive-vote|title=Cases in Which Sandra Day O'Connor Cast the Decisive Vote|website=American Civil Liberties Union|language=en|access-date=April 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', {{ussc|539|306|2003}} and ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'', {{ussc|539|244|2003}}, O'Connor wrote the opinion of the Court in ''Grutter'' and joined the majority in ''Gratz''. In this pair of cases, the [[University of Michigan]]'s undergraduate admissions program was held to have engaged in unconstitutional [[reverse discrimination]], but the more-limited type of [[affirmative action]] in the [[University of Michigan Law School]]'s admissions program was held to have been constitutional.
* ''[[Lockyer v. Andrade]]'', {{ussc|538|63|2003}}: O'Connor wrote the majority opinion, with the four conservative justices concurring, that a 50-year to life sentence without parole for petty shoplifting a few children's videotapes under California's three strikes law was not cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment because there was no &quot;clearly established&quot; law to that effect. Leandro Andrade, a Latino nine year Army veteran and father of three, will be eligible for parole in 2046 at age eighty-seven.
* ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]'', {{ussc|536|639|2002}}, O'Connor joined the majority holding that the use of school vouchers for religious schools did not violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.
*''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', {{ussc|514|549|1995}}: O'Connor joined a majority holding unconstitutional the [[Gun-Free School Zones Act]] as beyond Congress's [[Commerce Clause]] power.
* ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', {{ussc|531|98|2000}}, O'Connor joined with four other justices on December 12, 2000, to rule on the ''Bush v. Gore'' case that ceased challenges to the results of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] (ruling to stop the ongoing [[Florida election recount]] and to allow no further recounts). This case effectively ended Gore's hopes to become president. Some legal scholars have argued that she should have recused herself from this case, citing several reports that she became upset when the media initially announced that Gore had won Florida, with her husband explaining that they would have to wait another four years before retiring to Arizona.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neumann&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Richard K., Jr. |last=Neumann |title=Conflicts of interest in Bush v.

O'Connor played an important role in other notable cases, such as:
* ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'', {{ussc|492|490|1989}}: This decision upheld as constitutional state restrictions on second trimester abortions that are not necessary to protect maternal health, contrary to the original trimester requirements in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. Although O'Connor joined the majority, which also included Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy and [[Byron White]], in a concurring opinion she refused to explicitly overturn ''Roe''.

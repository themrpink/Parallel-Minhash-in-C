The ''Spiritual Canticle'' was first included in the 1630 edition, produced by Fray Jeronimo de San José, at Madrid. This edition was largely followed by later editors, although editions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries gradually included a few more poems and letters.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Saint John of the Cross''. Translated and edited by E. Allison Peers, from the critical edition of Silverio de Santa Teresa. 3 vols. (Westminster, MD: Newman Press, 1943). Vol. I, pp. l-lxxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

The first French edition was published in Paris in 1622, and the first Castilian edition in 1627 in Brussels.

A critical edition of St John of the Cross's work in English was published by E Allison Peers in 1935.

== Intellectual influences ==
The influences on John's writing are subject to an ongoing debate.
It is widely acknowledged that at Salamanca university there would have existed a range of intellectual positions. In John's time they included the influences of [[Thomas Aquinas]], of [[Duns Scotus|Scotus]] and of [[Guillaume Durand|Durandus]].&lt;ref&gt;Crisogono (1958), pp. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; It is often assumed that John would have absorbed the thought of Aquinas, to explain the scholastic framework of his writings.

However, the belief that John was taught at both the Carmelite College of San Andrès and at the University of Salamanca has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;By L. Rodríguez-San Pedro Bezares, 'La Formación Universitaria de Juan de la Cruz', ''Actas del Congreso Internacional Sanjuanista'' (Valladolid, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Bezares calls into question whether John even studied theology at the University of Salamanca. The philosophy courses John probably took in logic, natural and moral philosophy, can be reconstructed, but Bezares argues that John in fact abandoned his studies at Salamanca in 1568 to join Teresa, rather than graduating.&lt;ref&gt;Bezares, p19&lt;/ref&gt; In the first biography of John, published in 1628, it is claimed, on the basis of information from John's fellow students, that he in 1567 made a special study of mystical writers, in particular of Pseudo-Dionysius and [[Pope Gregory I]].&lt;ref&gt;The 1628 biography of John is by Quiroga. The information is from Crisogono (1958), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eulogio Pacho (1969), pp. 56-59; Steven Payne, ''John of the Cross and the Cognitive Value of Mysticism: An Analysis of Sanjuanist Teaching and its Philosophical Implications for Contemporary Discussions of Mystical Experience'' (1990), p. 14, n. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;
There is little consensus from John's early years or potential influences.

=== Scripture ===
John was evidently influenced by the [[Bible]]. Scriptural images are common in both his poems and prose. In total, there are 1,583 explicit and 115 implicit quotations from the Bible in his works.&lt;ref name=Tyler&gt;{{cite book |last=Tyler|first=Peter|title=St John of the Cross|year=2010|publisher=Continuum|location=New York}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the ''Song of Songs'' on John's ''Spiritual Canticle'' has often been noted, both in terms of the structure of the poem, with its dialogue between two lovers, the account of their difficulties in meeting each other and the &quot;offstage chorus&quot; that comments on the action, and also in terms of the imagery for example, of pomegranates, wine cellar, turtle dove and lilies, which echoes that of the ''Song of Songs''.&lt;ref name=Tyler /&gt;

In addition, John shows at occasional points the influence of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]]. This demonstrates how John, steeped in the language and rituals of the Church, drew at times on the phrases and language here.&lt;ref&gt;This occurs in the ''Living Flame'' at 1.16 and 2.3. See John Sullivan, 'Night and Light: the Poet John of the Cross and the Exultet of the Easter Liturgy', ''Ephemerides Carmeliticae'', 30:1 (1979), pp. 52-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pseudo-Dionysius ===
It has rarely been disputed that the overall structure of John's mystical theology, and his language of the union of the soul with God, is influenced by the pseudo-Dionysian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;John mentions Dionysius explicitly four times—S2.8.6; N2.5.3; CB14-15.16; Ll3-3.49. Luis Girón-Negrón, 'Dionysian thought in sixteenth-century Spanish mystical theology', ''Modern Theology'', 24(4), (2008), p699&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not been clear whether John might have had direct access to the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], or whether this influence may have been mediated through various later authors.

=== Medieval mystics ===
It is widely acknowledged that John may have been influenced by the writings of other medieval mystics, though there is debate about the exact thought which may have influenced him, and about how he might have been exposed to their ideas.

The possibility of influence by the so-called &quot;[[Rhineland mystics]]&quot; such as [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Johannes Tauler]], [[Henry Suso]] and [[John of Ruysbroeck]] has also been mooted by many authors.&lt;ref&gt;However, there is little precise agreement on which particular mystics may have been influential. [[Jean Orcibal]], ''S Jean de la Croix et les mystiques Rheno-Flamands'' (Desclee-Brouwer, Presence du Carmel, no. 6); Crisogono (1929), I, 17, believed that John was influenced more by German mysticism, than perhaps by [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the [[School of Saint Victor]] and the ''[[The Imitation of Christ|Imitation]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secular Spanish poetry ===
However, a strong argument can also be made for contemporary Spanish literary influences on John. This case was first made in detail by Dámaso Alonso, who believed that as well as drawing from scripture, John was transforming non-religious, profane themes, derived from popular songs (''romanceros'') into religious poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Dámaso Alonso, ''La poesía de San Juan de la Cruz'' (Madrid, 1942)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic influence ===
A controversial theory on the origins of John's mystical imagery is that he may have been influenced by Islamic sources. This was first proposed in detail by Miguel Asín Palacios and has been most recently put forward by the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] scholar [[Luce López-Baralt]].&lt;ref&gt;Luce Lopez Baralt, ''Juan de la Cruz y el Islam'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that John was influenced by Islamic sources on the peninsula, she traces Islamic antecedents of the images of the &quot;dark night&quot;, the &quot;solitary bird&quot; of the ''Spiritual Canticle'', wine and mystical intoxication (the ''Spiritual Canticle''), lamps of fire (the ''Living Flame''). However, Peter Tyler concludes, there &quot;are sufficient Christian medieval antecedents for many of the metaphors John employs to suggest we should look for Christian sources rather than Muslim sources&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Tyler, ''St John of the Cross'' (2010), pp. 138-142&lt;/ref&gt; As José Nieto indicates, in trying to locate a link between Spanish Christian mysticism and Islamic mysticism, it might make more sense to refer to the common Neo-Platonic tradition and mystical experiences of both, rather than seek direct influence.&lt;ref&gt;José Nieto, ''Mystic, Rebel, Saint: A Study of St. John of the Cross'' (Geneva, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="7957" xml:space="preserve">'''Robert of Ketton''', known in Latin as '''Rodbertus Ketenensis''' ({{floruit}} 1141–1157), was an English astronomer, translator, priest and diplomat active in Spain. He translated several works of [[Arabic]] into [[Latin]], including the first translation of the [[Quran]] into any Western language. Between 1144 and 1157 he held an [[archdeaconry]] in the [[diocese of Pamplona]]. In the past he has been confounded with [[Robert of Chester]] (Latin ''Robertus Castrensis''), another English translator active in Spain in the mid-twelfth century; and at least one modern scholar believes they are the same person.&lt;ref name=Burnett&gt;Charles Burnett, &quot;Ketton, Robert of (''fl''. 1141–1157)&quot;, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert's byname, ''Ketenensis'' or on one occasion ''de Ketene'', is usually taken to refer to [[Ketton]], a village in [[Rutland]], a few miles from [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], [[Lincolnshire]]. It was probably Robert's birthplace. This nickname was never used in official documents associated with Pamplona, where he was always simply &quot;Master Robert&quot; (''magister Rodbertus''), indicating that he had a [[Master of Arts|master of arts]] degree. The identification of the translator known as Robert of Ketton and the archdeacon known as Master Robert is provided by a letter of [[Peter the Venerable]], [[abbot of Cluny]]. In the spring or summer of 1144, when Peter sent some of Robert's translations to [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]. In the accompanying letter he named the translator as &quot;Robert of Ketton from England, who is now archdeacon of the church of Pamplona&quot; (''Roberto Ketenensi de Anglia, qui nunc Pampilonensis ecclesiae archidiaconus est'').&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt;

==Translations==
Prior to 1141, Robert of Ketton and [[Hermann of Carinthia]] were engaged in a project of translating Arabic texts into Latin for their own use and education. Only one product of Robert from this early collaboration is known or has survived. On Hermann's request, Robert translated [[al-Kindi]]'s ''Astrological Judgements'' (under the Latin title ''Judicia''). Many later manuscripts misattribute it to [[Robertus Anglicus]]. In the preface to this translation, he explains that his interest is in geometry and astronomy, but that he is undertaking an astrological work for the sake of his friendship with Hermann. Their real plan, he says, is to work through [[Euclid]]'s [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']] and [[Theodosius of Bithynia|Theodosius]]'s ''[[Sphaerics]]'' in order to be capable of understanding [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''. All of these texts would have been available to them only in Arabic at that time.&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt;

It has been suggested that one other text that survives might be Robert's work from his and Hermann's private collaboration: a translation of Euclid's ''Elements'' known as &quot;Adelard II&quot;, which is usually attributed to [[Adelard of Bath]] and sometimes to Robert of Chester. It was the most popular of several Latin translations of Euclid from the twelfth century. In his translation of Ptolemy's ''[[Planisphere]]'' of 1143, Hermann also mentions that Robert gave him the astronomical tables of [[al-Battani]], perhaps in translation.&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt;

In 1141, Robert and Hermann met Abbot Peter the Venerable on the banks of the [[Ebro]], probably at [[Logroño]], and he convinced them to translate some Islamic texts for his collection, which has become known as the [[Toledan Collection]]. For this project, Robert translated a history of the early [[Caliphate]] under the title ''Chronica mendosa Saracenorum'' (Lying Chronicle of the Saracens) and the Quran itself under the title ''[[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete]]'' (Law of the False Prophet Muhammad). For the latter work he was assisted by a certain Muhammad. His translation is very free and he does not subdivide the text according to the [[sura]]s. The entire Toledan Collection was printed by the Protestant printer [[Theodore Bibliander]] at Basel in 1543.&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt;

As late as 1143, Robert still had in mind his and Hermann's pet project of astronomical translations, for he wrote a letter to Peter the Venerable promising &quot;a celestial gift which embraces within itself the whole of science … revealing most accurately, according to number, proportion and measure, all the celestial circles and their quantities, orders and conditions, and, finally, all the various movements of the stars, and their effects and natures.&quot;&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt;

==Ecclesiastical career==
Robert's career in the church began after his career as a translator had ended. (Perhaps he received his [[benefice]] as a reward for his work.) He was an archdeacon at Pamplona from at least 1144—and probably shortly before that—until 1157, when he was transferred to a [[canonry]] of [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]]. His presence at Pamplona is known from documents of 1145, 1147, 1149 and 1151. He was in [[Barcelona]] on official business in 1152. He seems to have held the archdeaconry of Valdonsella, which included the town of [[Uncastillo]]. Since the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] regained its independence in 1134, this lay on the border with and was disputed by the [[Kingdom of Aragon]]. Robert served King [[García Ramírez of Navarre]] (whose grandfather, [[Sancho Garcés, Lord of Uncastillo|Sancho Garcés]], was lord of Uncastillo) as a diplomat, even drawing up the peace treaty signed with [[Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona|Raymond Berengar IV]], regent of Aragon, on 1 July 1149. For this effort on behalf of peace, he was commended by Pope [[Pope Eugenius III|Eugenius III]].&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt;

In 1151, Robert's bishop, [[Lope de Artajona]], sent him as his delegate to a conference to resolve the disputed boundary between the dioceses of Pamplona and [[Diocese of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]]. Later, Robert led some of the Pamplonese clergy into rebellion against Lope. Their dispute was for a time patched up, but when Lope came into conflict with King [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI]], Robert joined the king's side. It was probably through the king that he obtained the canonry in Tudela after his archdeaconry had become untenable. There is no record of him after 1157. Charles Burnett notes that &quot;Robert's education fit him well for the roles of diplomat, royal adviser and redactor of official documents.&quot;&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt;

Cyclotrons were the most powerful particle accelerator technology until the 1950s when they were superseded by the [[synchrotron]], and are still used to produce particle beams in physics and [[nuclear medicine]]. The largest single-magnet cyclotron was the {{convert|184|in|m|2|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[synchrocyclotron]] built between 1940 and 1946 by Lawrence at the [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Close&quot; /&gt; which could accelerate protons to 730 mega electron volts ([[MeV]]). The largest cyclotron is the {{convert|56|ft|m|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} multimagnet [[TRIUMF]] accelerator at the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], which can produce 500&amp;nbsp;MeV protons.

Over 1200 cyclotrons are used in nuclear medicine worldwide for the production of [[radionuclide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.einnews.com/pr_news/300008215/medraysintell-identifies-more-than-1-200-medical-cyclotrons-worldwide|title=MEDraysintell identifies more than 1,200 medical cyclotrons worldwide|first=IPD|last=Group|date=3 December 2015|work=einnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had also been working along similar lines with the [[betatron]] concept. At the [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Lawrence constructed a series of cyclotrons which were the most powerful accelerators in the world at the time; a {{convert|27|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} 4.8&amp;nbsp;MeV machine (1932), a {{convert|37|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} 8&amp;nbsp;MeV machine (1937), and a {{convert|60|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} 16&amp;nbsp;MeV machine (1939). He also developed a {{convert|184|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|0}}, 730 MeV [[synchrocyclotron]] (1945). Lawrence received the 1939 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this work.

In [[Nazi Germany]] a cyclotron was built in [[Heidelberg]] under supervision of [[Walther Bothe]] and [[Wolfgang Gentner]], with support from the [[Heereswaffenamt]], and became operative in 1943.

==Principle of operation==

A cyclotron accelerates a [[charged particle beam]] using a [[high frequency]] alternating [[voltage]] which is applied between two hollow &quot;D&quot;-shaped sheet metal electrodes called &quot;dees&quot; inside a vacuum chamber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dees are placed face to face with a narrow gap between them, creating a cylindrical space within them for the particles to move. The particles are injected into the center of this space. The dees are located between the poles of a large [[electromagnet]] which applies a static [[magnetic field]] ''B'' perpendicular to the electrode plane. The magnetic field causes the particles' path to bend in a circle due to the [[Lorentz force]] perpendicular to their direction of motion.

If the particles' speeds were constant, they would travel in a circular path within the dees under the influence of the magnetic field. However a [[radio frequency]] (RF) alternating voltage of several thousand [[volt]]s is applied between the dees. The voltage creates an oscillating electric field in the gap between the dees that accelerates the particles.  The frequency is set so that the particles make one circuit during a single cycle of the voltage. To achieve this, the frequency must match the particle's [[cyclotron resonance]] frequency
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{q B}{2\pi m}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''B'' is the [[magnetic field]] strength, ''q'' is the [[electric charge]] of the particle and ''m'' is the [[relativistic mass]] of the charged particle. Each time after the particles pass to the other dee electrode the polarity of the RF voltage reverses. Therefore, each time the particles cross the gap from one dee electrode to the other, the [[electric field]] is in the correct direction to accelerate them. The particles' increasing speed due to these pushes causes them to move in a larger radius circle with each rotation, so the particles move in a [[spiral]] path outward from the center to the rim of the dees. When they reach the rim a small voltage on a metal plate deflects the beam so it exits the dees through a small gap between them, and hits a target located at the exit point at the rim of the chamber, or leaves the cyclotron through an evacuated beam tube to hit a remote target. Various materials may be used for the target, and the [[nuclear reactions]] due to the collisions will create secondary particles which may be guided outside of the cyclotron and into instruments for analysis.

The cyclotron was the first &quot;cyclical&quot; accelerator. The advantage of the cyclotron design over the existing [[electrostatic accelerator]]s of the time such as the [[Cockcroft-Walton accelerator]] and [[Van de Graaff generator]], was that in these machines the particles were only accelerated once by the voltage, so the particles' energy was equal to the accelerating voltage on the machine, which was limited by air breakdown to a few million volts. In the cyclotron, in contrast, the particles encounter the accelerating voltage many times during their spiral path, and so are accelerated many times,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence&quot;/&gt; so the output energy can be many times the accelerating voltage.

==Particle energy==
Since the particles in a cyclotron are accelerated by the voltage many times, the final energy of the particles is not dependent on the accelerating voltage but on the strength of the magnetic field and the diameter of the accelerating chamber, the dees. Cyclotrons can only accelerate particles to speeds much slower than the [[speed of light]], [[nonrelativistic]] speeds. For nonrelativistic particles, the centripetal force &lt;math&gt;F_C\;&lt;/math&gt; required to keep them in their curved path is
:&lt;math&gt;F_C = {m v^2 \over r}\;&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m\;&lt;/math&gt; is the particle's mass, &lt;math&gt;v\;&lt;/math&gt; its velocity, and &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the path. This force is provided by the [[Lorentz force]] &lt;math&gt;F_B\,&lt;/math&gt; of the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_B = qvB\;&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;q\,&lt;/math&gt; is the particle's charge. The particles reach their maximum energy at the periphery of the dees, where the radius of their path is &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt; the radius of the dees. Equating these two forces
:&lt;math&gt;{m v^2 \over R} = qvB\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v = {qBR \over m}\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the output energy of the particles is
{{Equation box 1 |indent =: |cellpadding = 0 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour = transparent
|equation = &lt;math&gt;E = {1 \over 2}mv^2 = \frac {q^2 B^2 R^2}{2m}\;&lt;/math&gt;
}}
Therefore, the limit to the cyclotron's output energy for a given type of particle is the strength of the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, which is limited to about 2 T for [[ferromagnetic]] electromagnets, and the radius of the dees &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, which is determined by the diameter of the magnet's pole pieces. So very large magnets were constructed for cyclotrons, culminating in Lawrence's 1946 synchrocyclotron, which had pole pieces {{convert|184|in|m|2|order=flip|abbr=on}} (15.3 feet) in diameter.

==Relativistic considerations==
[[File:1937-French-cyclotron.jpg|thumb|A French cyclotron, produced in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] in 1937. The vacuum chamber containing the dees ''(at left)'' has been removed from the magnet ''(red, at right)'']]

In [[classical mechanics|the non-relativistic approximation]], the cyclotron frequency does not depend upon the particle's speed or the radius of the particle's orbit. As the beam spirals outward, the rotation frequency stays constant, and the beam continues to accelerate as it travels a greater distance in the same time period.

In contrast to this approximation, as particles approach the [[speed of light]], the cyclotron frequency decreases proportionally to the particle's [[Lorentz factor]]. A rigorous proof of this fact (starting from Newton's second law) is given here: [[Relativistic_mechanics#Force]]. Acceleration of relativistic particles therefore requires either modification to the frequency during the acceleration, leading to the ''synchrocyclotron'', or modification to the magnetic field during the acceleration, which leads to the ''isochronous cyclotron''. The relativistic mass can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}} = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}} = \gamma {m_0}&lt;/math&gt;,
where
:&lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the particle [[rest mass]],
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{v}{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the relative velocity, and
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lorentz factor]].

The relativistic cyclotron frequency and angular frequency can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{q B}{2\pi \gamma m_0} = \frac{f_0}{\gamma} = {f_0}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}} = {f_0}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = {2\pi f} = \frac{q B}{\gamma m_0} = \frac{\omega_0}{\gamma} = {\omega_0}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}} = {\omega_0}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;,
where
:&lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; would be the cyclotron frequency in classical approximation,
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; would be the cyclotron angular frequency in classical approximation.

The [[gyroradius]] for a particle moving in a static magnetic field is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{v}{\omega} = \frac{\beta c}{\omega} = \frac{\gamma \beta m_0 c}{q B}&lt;/math&gt;,
because
:&lt;math&gt;\omega r = v = \beta c&lt;/math&gt;
where v would be the (linear) velocity.

===Synchrocyclotron===
{{Main|Synchrocyclotron}}
A synchrocyclotron is a cyclotron in which the frequency of the driving RF electric field is varied to compensate for relativistic effects as the particles' velocity begins to approach the speed of light. This is in contrast to the classical cyclotron, where the frequency was held constant, thus leading to the synchrocyclotron operation frequency being
:&lt;math&gt; f = \frac{f_0}{\gamma} = {f_0}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; is the classical cyclotron frequency and &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{v}{c}&lt;/math&gt; again is the relative velocity of the particle beam. The rest mass of an electron is 511&amp;nbsp;keV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so the frequency correction is 1% for a magnetic vacuum tube with a 5.11&amp;nbsp;kV direct current accelerating voltage. The proton mass is nearly two thousand times the electron mass, so the 1% correction energy is about 9&amp;nbsp;MeV, which is sufficient to induce [[nuclear reaction]]s.

===Isochronous cyclotron===
An alternative to the synchrocyclotron is the ''isochronous cyclotron'', which has a magnetic field that increases with radius, rather than with time. Isochronous cyclotrons are capable of producing much greater beam current than synchrocyclotrons, but require azimuthal variations in the field strength to provide a [[strong focusing]] effect and keep the particles captured in their spiral trajectory. For this reason, an isochronous cyclotron is also called an &quot;AVF (azimuthal varying field) cyclotron&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sylee014&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution for focusing the particle beam was proposed by [[Llewellyn Thomas|L. H. Thomas]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;sylee014&quot;/&gt;
Recalling the relativistic [[gyroradius]] &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{\gamma m_0 v}{q B}&lt;/math&gt; and the relativistic cyclotron frequency &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{f_0}{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, one can choose &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to be proportional to the Lorentz factor, &lt;math&gt;B = \gamma B_0&lt;/math&gt;. This results in the relation
&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{m_0 v}{q B_0}&lt;/math&gt; which again only depends on the velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, like in the non-relativistic case. Also, the cyclotron frequency is constant in this case.

==Behaviour==
[[File:Two Dalls Porpoises.JPG|thumb|right|&quot;Rooster tail&quot; spray around swimming [[Dall's porpoise]]s]]

===Life cycle===
Porpoises are fully aquatic creatures. Females deliver a single calf after a [[gestation period]] lasting about a year.  Calving takes place entirely under water, with the foetus positioned for tail-first delivery to help prevent drowning.  Females have mammary glands, but the shape of a newborn calf's mouth does not allow it to obtain a seal around the nipple— instead of the calf sucking milk, the mother squirts milk into the calf's mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor=Kenneth Stafford Norris|author=E. J. Slijper|title=Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises|chapter=Functional morphology of the reproductive system in Cetecea| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-iptRSGHIQC&amp;pg=PA310|year=1966|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03283-5|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; This milk contains high amounts of fat, which aids in the development of blubber; it contains so much fat that it has the consistency of toothpaste. The calves are weaned at about 11 months of age.  Males play no part in rearing calves.  The calf is dependent for one to two years, and maturity occurs after seven to ten years, all varying between species. This [[R/K selection theory|mode of reproduction]] produces few offspring, but increases the probability of each one surviving.&lt;ref name=r.reeves&gt;{{cite book|first1=Randall|last1=Reeves|first2=Brent|last2=Stewart|first3=Phillip|last3=Clapham|first4=James|last4=Powell|year=2002|title=National Audubon Society Guide to Marine Mammals of the World|isbn=978-0-375-41141-0|url=https://archive.org/details/guidetomarinemam00folk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
Porpoises eat a wide variety of creatures. The stomach contents of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on [[Demersal_fish#Benthic_fish|benthic fish]], and sometimes [[pelagic fish]]. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as ''[[Ulva lactuca]]'', is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of [[bait fish]], like [[herring]], and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on [[cephalopod]]s and bait fish, like [[capelin]] and [[sardine]]s. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porpoise&quot;/&gt;

The finless porpoise is known to also follow seasonal migrations. It is known that populations in the mouth of the [[Indus River]] migrate to the sea from April through October to feed on the annual spawning of [[prawn]]s. In Japan, sightings of small pods of them herding [[sand lance]] onto shore are common year-round.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porpoise&quot;/&gt;

Little is known about the diets of other species of porpoises. A dissection of three Burmeister's porpoises shows that they consume shrimp and [[euphausiid]]s (krill). A dissection of a beached Vaquita showed remains of squid and [[grunt (fish)|grunts]]. Nothing is known about the diet of the spectacled porpoise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porpoise&quot;/&gt;

In [[Aristotle]]'s time, the 4th century BCE, porpoises were regarded as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his “Natural history”. In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The [[harbour porpoise]] was one of the most accessible species for early [[cetology|cetologists]], because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Conrad Gesner|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/AriHian.html|title=Historiae animalium |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080906090248/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/AriHian.html |archive-date=6 September 2008 |access-date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.

===In captivity===
{{Main|Cetaceans in captivity}}
[[File:Harbor Porpoise Fjord Baelt Denmark.JPG|thumb|[[Harbour porpoise]] in captivity]]

Harbour porpoises have historically been kept in captivity, under the assumption that they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their smaller size and shallow-water habitats. Up until the 1980s, they were consistently short-lived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porpoise&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Collet1984&gt;{{cite journal| author=Collet, A. | year=1984 | title=Live-Capture of Cetaceans for European Institutions | journal=Rep.

Comm. | volume=34 | pages=603–607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harbour porpoises have a very long captive history, with poorly documented attempts as early as the 15th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Porpoise&quot;/&gt; and better documented starting in the 1860s and 1870s in [[London Zoo]], the now-closed [[Brighton]] Aquarium &amp; Dolphinarium, and a zoo in Germany.&lt;ref name=Collet1984/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.zootierliste.de/en/?klasse=1&amp;ordnung=114&amp;familie=11403&amp;art=1110105&amp;subhaltungen=2|title=North Atlantic Harbour porpoise|work=Zootierliste|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 150 harbour porpoises have been kept worldwide, but only about 20 were actively caught for captivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porpoise&quot;/&gt; The captive history is best documented from Denmark where about 100 harbour porpoises have been kept, most in the 1960s and 1970s. All but two were incidental catches in fishing nets or strandings. Nearly half of these died within a month of diseases caught before they were captured or from damage sustained during capture. Up until 1984, none lived for more than 14 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porpoise&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Collet1984/&gt; Attempts of rehabilitation seven rescued individuals in 1986 only resulted in three that could be released 6 months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porpoise&quot;/&gt; Very few have been brought into captivity later, but they have lived considerably longer. In recent decades the only place keeping the species in Denmark is the Fjord &amp; Bælt Centre, where three rescues have been kept, along with their offspring. Among the three rescues, one (father of world's first harbour porpoise born in captivity) lived for 20 years in captivity and another 15 years, while the third (mother of first born in captivity) was still alive in 2018 after 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fyens.dk/kerteminde/Doedsfald-paa-FjordBaelt-Sif-blev-15-aar/artikel/3226969|title=Dødsfald på Fjord&amp;Bælt: Sif blev 15 år|work=fyens.dk|date=1 February 2018|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tv2fyn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tv2fyn.dk/artikel/eigil-er-doed|title=Tab for forskningen: Marsvinet Eigil er død|work=tv2fyn.dk|date=28 April 2016|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is older than the typical age reached in the wild, which is 14 years or less.&lt;ref name=tv2fyn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Read, A. | author2=Hohn, A.A. | year=1995 | title=Life in the fast lane: The life history of harbor porpoises from the Gulf of Maine | journal=Marine Mammal Science | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=423–440 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.1995.tb00667.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADWHarbourPorpoise&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Phocoena_phocoena/|title=Phocoena phocoena, harbor porpoise|work=animaldiversity.org|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few harbour porpoises have been born in captivity.

Finless porpoises have commonly been kept in Japan, as well as China and Indonesia. As of 1984, ninety-four in total had been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, and at least two in Indonesia. As of 1986, three establishments in Japan had bred them, and there had been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porpoise&quot;/&gt; This breeding success, combined with the results with harbour porpoise in Denmark and the Netherlands, proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, and this could open up new conservation options.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porpoise&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldfarb2016&gt;{{cite journal| author=Goldfarb, B. | year=2016 | title=Can captive breeding save Mexico's vaquita?| journal=Conservation Biology | volume=353 | issue=6300 | pages=633–634 | doi=10.1126/science.353.6300.633 | pmid=27516576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reopened [[Miyajima Public Aquarium]] (Japan) houses three finless porpoises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2011/08/05/events/events-outside-tokyo/hiroshima-revamps-its-aquarium/#.Ve4pN_lVhBc|title=Hiroshima revamps its aquarium|newspaper=Japan Times|first=Wade|last=Bunnel}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of an attempt of saving the [[Narrow-ridged finless porpoise|narrow-ridged (or Yangtze) finless porpoise]], several are kept in the Baiji Dolphinarium in China.

Small numbers of Dall's porpoises have been kept in captivity in both the United States and Japan, with the most recent being in the 1980s. These animals consistently failed to thrive. Captive Dall's porpoises often repeatedly ran into the walls of their enclosures, refused food, and exhibited [[skin sloughing]]. Almost all Dall's porpoises introduced to aquaria died shortly after, typically within days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porpoise&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=DallsInCaptivity&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dolphinproject.com/blog/wayback-machine-dalls-porpoises-in-captivity/|title=Wayback Machine: Dall's Porpoises in Captivity|work=dolphinproject.com|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two have lived for more than 60 days: a male reached 15 months at [[Marineland of the Pacific]] and another 21 months at a [[United States Navy Marine Mammal Program|United States Navy facility]].&lt;ref name=DallsInCaptivity/&gt;

As part of last-ditch effort of saving the extremely rare [[vaquita]] (the tiny remaining population is rapidly declining because of bycatch in gillnets), there have been attempts of transferring some to captivity.&lt;ref name=Goldfarb2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/captivity-last-hope-for-saving-the-vaquita/a-36799824|title=Captivity: Last hope for saving the vaquita?|work=Deutsche Welle|date=16 December 2016|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and only caught for captivity were two females in 2017.

===Threats===

====Hunting====
[[File:FMIB 35846 Porpoise Fishery.jpeg|thumb|Traditional catch of [[harbour porpoise]] by lancing in [[Bay of Fundy]]]]
Porpoises and other smaller cetaceans have traditionally been hunted in many areas for their meat and blubber. A dominant hunting technique is drive hunting, where a pod of animals is driven together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. This type of fishery for [[harbour porpoise]]s is well documented from the [[Danish Straits]], where it occurred regularly until the end of the [[19th century]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petersen |first1=Åge |title=Marsvin og marsvinjægere |date=1969 |publisher=Middelfart By- og Egnshistoriske Museum |location=Middelfart, Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and picked up again during [[World war I]] and [[World War II]]. The [[Inuit]] in the [[Arctic]] hunt harbour porpoises by shooting and drive hunt for [[Dall's porpoise]] still takes place in [[Japan]]. The number of individuals taken each year is in the thousands, although a quota of around 17,000 per year is in effect today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jefferson |first1=TA |last2=Braulik |first2=G |title=''Phocoenoides dalli'' |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/17032/50370912 |website=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest direct hunt of any [[cetacean]] species in the world &lt;ref name=&quot;smm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=''Phocoenoides dalli'' (Dall's porpoise, Dall porpoise) |url=https://www.marinemammalscience.org/facts/phocoenoides-dalli/ |website=The Society for Marine Mammalogy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sustainability of the hunt has been questioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;IWChunt&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report of the Sub-Committee on Small Cetaceans |journal=International Whaling Commission |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smm2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wells |first1=RS |title=Letter to Japanese Government Regarding Dolphin and Small Whale Hunts |url=https://www.marinemammalscience.org/letters/letter-to-japanese-government-regarding-dolphin-and-small-whale-hunts/ |website=The Society for Marine Mammalogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fishing====
{{Main|Cetacean bycatch}}
[[File:Vaquita2 Olson NOAA.jpg|thumb|A [[vaquita]] swimming in the [[Gulf of California]].]]
Porpoises are highly affected by [[bycatch]]. Many porpoises, mainly the [[vaquita]], are subject to great mortality due to [[gillnetting]]. Although it is the world's most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita continues to be caught in small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was estimated to be at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'agrosa|first1=C.|last2=Lennert-Cody|first2=C.

The fishing market, historically has always had a porpoise bycatch. Today, the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]] has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|title=America's Favorite Fish Tainted by Porpoise Deaths|last=Croft|first=Chris|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-04-17/opinion/op-1956_1_tuna-fishing|access-date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental hazards====
{{See also|Marine mammals and sonar}}
Porpoises are very sensitive to [[anthropogenic effect|anthropogenic]] disturbances,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Harbour porpoises (''Phocoena phocoena'') stranded along the southern North Sea: an assessment through metallic contamination |last1=Mahfouz |first1=C |last2=Henry |first2=F |last3=Courcot |first3=L |last4=Pezeril |first4=S |last5=Bouveroux |first5=T |last6=Dabin |first6=W |last7=Jauniaux |first7=T |last8=Khalaf |first8=G |last9=Amara |first9=R |year=2014 |journal= Environmental Research|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2014.06.006 |pmid=24981825 |volume=133 |pages=266–73|bibcode=2014ER....133..266M |url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/169176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are [[keystone species]], which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Siebert |first1=Ursula |last2=Pozniak |first2=Blazej |last3=Hansen |first3=Kirstin |last4=Anderson |last5=Nordstrom |first5=Gwyneth |last6=Teilmann |first6=Jonas |last7=Van Elk |first7=Niels |last8=Vossen |first8=Ardnt |last9=Dietz |first9=Rune |year=2011 |title=Investigations of Thyroid and Stress Hormones in Free-Ranging and Captive Harbor Porpoises (''Phocoena phocoena''): A Pilot Study |journal=Aquatic Mammals |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=443–453 |doi=10.1578/am.37.4.2011.443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]] are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring.&lt;ref name=wdcs&gt;{{cite book |author=Cara E. Miller |title=Current State of Knowledge of Cetacean Threats, Diversity, and Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region |publisher=Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society |year=2007 |access-date=5 September 2015 |isbn=978-0-646-47224-9 |url=http://uk.whales.org/sites/default/files/whales-and-dolphins-in-the-pacific-islands.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908003502/http://uk.whales.org/sites/default/files/whales-and-dolphins-in-the-pacific-islands.pdf |archive-date=8 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harbour porpoises from the [[English Channel]] were found to have accumulated heavy metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The military and geologists employ strong [[sonar]] and produce an increases in noise in the oceans. [[Marine mammal]]s that make use of [[biosonar]] for orientation and communication are not only hindered by the extra noise, but may race to the surface in panic. This may lead to a bubbling out of blood gases, and the animal then dies because the blood vessels become blocked, so-called [[decompression sickness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=M. Andre |author2=T. Johansson |author3=E.

Additionally, civilian vessels produce sonar waves in order to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Culik |first1=B. |last2=von Dorrien |first2=C. |last3=Muller |first3=V. |last4=Conrad |first4=M. |year=2015 |title=Bioacoustics |journal=The International Journal of Animal Sound and Its Recording |volume=24 |issue=3 |issn=0952-4622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, only 505 [[Yangtze finless porpoise]]s remained in the main section of the Yangtze, with an alarming population density in Ezhou and Zhenjiang. While many threatened species decline rate slows after their classification, population decline rates of the porpoise are actually accelerating. While population decline tracked from 1994 to 2008 has been pegged at a rate of 6.06% annually, from 2006 to 2012, the porpoise population decreased by more than half. Finless porpoise population decrease of 69.8% in just a 22-year span from 1976 to 2000. 5.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hashimoto|first1=M.|last2=Shirakihara|first2=K.|last3=Shirakihara|first3=M.|last4=Hiramatsu|first4=K.|year=2013|title=Estimating the rate of increase for the finless porpoise with special attention to predictions for the inland sea population in japan|journal=Population Ecology|volume=55|issue=3|pages=441–449|doi=10.1007/s10144-013-0374-5|s2cid=15843140}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of factors of this population decline are being driven by the massive growth in Chinese industry since 1990 which caused increased shipping and pollution and ultimately environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mei | first1 = Zhigang | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Xinqiao | last3 = Huang | first3 = Shiang-Lin | last4 = Zhao | first4 = Xiujiang | last5 = Hao | first5 = Yujiang | last6 = Zhang | first6 = Lin | last7 = Qian | first7 = Zhengyi | last8 = Zheng | first8 = Jinsong | last9 = Wang | first9 = Kexiong | last10 = Wang | first10 = Ding | year = 2014 | title = The Yangtze Finless Porpoise: On an Accelerating Path to Extinction? | url = http://ir.ihb.ac.cn/handle/342005/19995| journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 172 | pages = 117–23 | doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2014.02.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these can be seen in damming of the river as well as illegal fishing activity. To protect the species, China's Ministry of Agriculture classified the species as being National First Grade Key Protected Wild Animal, the strictest classification by law, meaning it is illegal to bring harm to a porpoise. Protective measures in the [[Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve]] has increased its population of porpoises from five to forty in 25 years. The [[Chinese Academy of Science]]'s [[Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology]] has been working with the [[World Wildlife Fund]] to ensure the future for this subspecies, and have placed five porpoises in another well-protected area, the He-wang-miao oxbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/saving-the-finless-porpoise|title=Saving the Finless Porpoise|first1=Karin|last1=Krchnak|date=30 September 2014|access-date=25 October 2015|work=[[World Wildlife Fund]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five protected natural reserves have been established in areas of the highest population density and mortality rates with measures being taken to ban patrolling and harmful fishing gear in those areas. There have also been efforts to study porpoise biology to help specialize conservation through captivation breeding. The Baiji Dolphinarium, was established in 1992 at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan which allowing the study of behavioral and biological factors affecting the finless porpoise, specifically breeding biology like seasonal changes in reproductive hormones and breeding behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=D.|last2=Hao|first2=Y.|last3=Wang|first3=K.|last4=Zhao|first4=Q.|last5=Chen|first5=D.|last6=Wei| first6=Z.|last7=Zhang|first7=X.|year=2005|title=the first yangtze finless porpoise successfully born in captivity|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research International|volume=12|issue=5|pages=247–250|doi=10.1065/espr2005.08.284|pmid=16206715|s2cid=37638759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[vaquita]]s are indigenous to the Gulf of California, [[Mexico]] is leading conservation efforts with the creation of the [[International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita]] (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barlow|first1=J.|year=2014|title=Vaquita (Phocoena sinus) |url=http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=78 |work=Edge of Existence programme|publisher=Zoological Society of London|access-date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIRVA has worked together with the [[CITES]], the [[Endangered Species Act]], and the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA_Vaquita&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Gulf of California Harbor Porpoise / Vaquita / Cochito (''Phocoena sinus'')|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/vaquita.htm|publisher=NOAA Fisheries–Office of Protected Resources|work= Species Information|date= 2013-07-08|access-date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order to try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering the upper part of the Gulf of California and the [[Colorado River delta]]. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn-csg.org/index.php/2015/04/24/president-of-mexico-launches-plan-to-save-the-vaquita/|title=President of Mexico launches plan to save the vaquita|author=Gill Braulik|date=24 April 2015|access-date=25 October 2015|work=IUCN SSC–Cetacean Specialist Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeremy Bentham''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|θ|ə|m}}; 15 February 1748 [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] 4 February 1747]&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2012&quot; /&gt; – 6 June 1832) was an English [[philosopher]], [[jurist]], and [[social reformer]] regarded as the founder of modern [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;utilitarianphilosophy.com&quot; /&gt;

Bentham defined as the &quot;fundamental [[axiom]]&quot; of his philosophy the principle that &quot;it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Betham, Jeremy. ''A Comment on the Commentaries and a Fragment on Government'', edited by [[J. H. Burns]] and [[H. L. A. Hart]]. London: [[The Athlone Press]]. 1977. p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Burns|2005 |pp=46–61 }} He became a leading theorist in [[Anglo-Americans|Anglo-American]] [[philosophy of law]], and a political radical whose ideas influenced the development of [[welfarism]]. He advocated [[Individualism|individual]] and [[economic freedom]]s, the [[separation of church and state]], [[freedom of expression]], equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and (in an unpublished essay) the decriminalising of homosexual acts.{{sfn|Bentham|2008|pp=389–406}}{{sfn|Campos Boralevi|2012|p=37}} He called for the abolition of [[abolitionism|slavery]], [[capital punishment#Abolition of capital punishment|capital punishment]] and [[physical punishment]], including that of children.{{sfn|Bedau|1983|pp=1033–1065}} He has also become known as an early advocate of [[animal rights]].{{sfn|Sunstein|2004|pp=3–4}}{{sfn|Francione|2004|p=139|ps=: footnote 78}}{{sfn|Gruen|2003|p=}}{{sfn|Benthall|2007|p=1}} Though strongly in favour of the extension of [[Individual and group rights|individual legal rights]], he opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]] (both of which are considered &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;God-given&quot; in origin), calling them &quot;nonsense upon stilts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweet&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Harrison|1995|pp=85–88}} Bentham was also a sharp critic of [[legal fiction]]s.

Bentham's students included his secretary and collaborator [[James Mill]], the latter's son, [[John Stuart Mill]], the legal philosopher [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]], American writer and activist [[John Neal (writer)|John Neal]], as well as [[Robert Owen]], one of the founders of [[utopian socialism]]. He &quot;had considerable influence on the reform of prisons, schools, poor laws, law courts, and Parliament itself.&quot;{{sfn|Roberts|Roberts|Bisson|2016|p=307}}

On his death in 1832, Bentham left instructions for his body to be first dissected, and then to be permanently preserved as an &quot;auto-icon&quot; (or self-image), which would be his memorial. This was done, and the auto-icon is now on public display in the entrance of the Student Centre at [[University College London]] (UCL). Because of his arguments in favour of the general availability of education, he has been described as the &quot;spiritual founder&quot; of UCL. However, he played only a limited direct part in its foundation.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCL Academic Figures&quot; /&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Thomas Frye.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Bentham by the studio of [[Thomas Frye]], 1760–1762]]

Bentham was born on 15 February 1748 in [[Houndsditch]], [[London]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; to a wealthy family that supported the [[Tory party]]. He was reportedly a child prodigy: he was found as a toddler sitting at his father's desk reading a multi-volume history of England, and he began to study [[Latin]] at the age of three.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucl.ac.uk&quot; /&gt; He learnt to play the [[violin]], and at the age of seven Bentham would perform [[sonata]]s by [[Handel]] during dinner parties.{{sfn|Warren|1969|p=}}{{incomplete short citation|date=April 2020}} He had one surviving sibling, [[Samuel Bentham]] (1757–1831), with whom he was close.

He attended [[Westminster School]]; in 1760, at age 12, his father sent him to [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], where he completed his bachelor's degree in 1763 and his master's degree in 1766. He trained as a lawyer and, though he never practised, was called to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] in 1769. He became deeply frustrated with the complexity of English law, which he termed the &quot;Demon of Chicane&quot;.{{Sfn | Stephen | 2011 | pages = 174–5}} When the American colonies published their [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in July 1776, the British government did not issue any official response but instead secretly commissioned London lawyer and pamphleteer [[John Lind (barrister)|John Lind]] to publish a rebuttal.{{sfn|Dupont |Onuf|2008|pp=32–33}} His 130-page tract was distributed in the colonies and contained an essay titled &quot;Short Review of the Declaration&quot; written by Bentham, a friend of Lind, which attacked and mocked the Americans' [[political philosophy]].{{sfn|Armitage|2007|p=}}{{sfn|Anonymous|1776|p=3}}

=== Abortive prison project and the Panopticon ===
In 1786 and 1787, Bentham travelled to [[Krychaw|Krichev]] in White Russia (modern [[Belarus]]) to visit his brother, [[Samuel Bentham|Samuel]], who was engaged in managing various industrial and other projects for [[Grigory Potemkin|Prince Potemkin]]. It was Samuel (as Jeremy later repeatedly acknowledged) who conceived the basic idea of a circular building at the hub of a larger compound as a means of allowing a small number of managers to oversee the activities of a large and unskilled workforce.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 99–100}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Prisons and prison systems: a global encyclopedia| first = Mitchel P | last = Roth |year= 2006 |publisher=Greenwood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTH31DgbTzgC&amp;pg=PA33|page= 33| isbn = 9780313328565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentham began to develop this model, particularly as applicable to prisons, and outlined his ideas in a series of letters sent home to his father in England.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 99–101}} He supplemented the supervisory principle with the idea of ''[[contract management]]''; that is, an administration by contract as opposed to trust, where the director would have a [[pecuniary]] interest in lowering the average rate of mortality.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 134–40}} 

The [[Panopticon]] was intended to be cheaper than the prisons of his time, as it required fewer staff; &quot;Allow me to construct a prison on this model,&quot; Bentham requested to a Committee for the Reform of Criminal Law, &quot;I will be the [[gaoler]]. You will see...that the [[gaoler]] will have no salary—will cost nothing to the nation.&quot; As the watchmen cannot be seen, they need not be on duty at all times, effectively leaving the watching to the watched. According to Bentham's design, the prisoners would also be used as menial labour, walking on wheels to spin [[loom]]s or run a [[water wheel]]. This would decrease the cost of the prison and give a possible source of income.&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy. [1797] 1995. &quot;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=V478RAAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA29 The Panopticon Letters].&quot; Pp. 29–95 in ''The Panopticon Writings'', edited by [[Miran Božovič|M. Božovič]]. London: [[Verso Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimately abortive proposal for a panopticon prison to be built in England was one among his many proposals for legal and social reform.{{sfn|Bentham|1787|p=}} But Bentham spent some sixteen years of his life developing and refining his ideas for the building and hoped that the government would adopt the plan for a National Penitentiary appointing him as contractor-governor. Although the prison was never built, the concept had an important influence on later generations of thinkers. Twentieth-century French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] argued that the panopticon was [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] of several 19th-century &quot;[[Discipline|disciplinary]]&quot; institutions.{{sfn|Foucault|1977|pp=200, 249–256}} Bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the panopticon scheme, convinced that it had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite. It was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of &quot;sinister interest&quot;—that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest—which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Schofield |title=Bentham: a guide for the perplexed |year=2009 |place=London |publisher= Continuum |isbn=978-0-8264-9589-1 |pages= 90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb|[[Multiview orthographic projection#Elevation|Elevation]], [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|section]] and [[Multiview orthographic projection#Plan|plan]] of Bentham's panopticon prison, drawn by [[Willey Reveley]] in 1791.]]
On his return to England from Russia, Bentham had commissioned drawings from an architect, [[Willey Reveley]].{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | p = 118}} In 1791, he published the material he had written as a book, although he continued to refine his proposals for many years to come. He had by now decided that he wanted to see the prison built: when finished, it would be managed by himself as contractor-governor, with the assistance of Samuel. After unsuccessful attempts to interest the authorities in Ireland and revolutionary France,&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 102–4, 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt; he started trying to persuade the prime minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], to revive an earlier abandoned scheme for a National Penitentiary in England, this time to be built as a panopticon. He was eventually successful in winning over Pitt and his advisors, and in 1794 was paid £2,000 for preliminary work on the project.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 108–10, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intended site was one that had been authorised (under an [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, 1760–1779|act]] of 1779) for the earlier Penitentiary, at [[Battersea]] Rise; but the new proposals ran into technical legal problems and objections from the local landowner, [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 169–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sites were considered, including one at Hanging Wood, near [[Woolwich]], but all proved unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 194–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Bentham turned to a site at Tothill Fields, near [[Westminster]]. Although this was common land, with no landowner, there were a number of parties with interests in it, including [[Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor|Earl Grosvenor]], who owned a house on an adjacent site and objected to the idea of a prison overlooking it. Again, therefore, the scheme ground to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 197–217.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, however, it became clear that a nearby site at [[Millbank]], adjoining the [[River Thames|Thames]], was available for sale, and this time things ran more smoothly. Using government money, Bentham bought the land on behalf of the Crown for £12,000 in November 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 217–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From his point of view, the site was far from ideal, being marshy, unhealthy, and too small. When he asked the government for more land and more money, however, the response was that he should build only a small-scale experimental prison—which he interpreted as meaning that there was little real commitment to the concept of the panopticon as a cornerstone of penal reform.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 226–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations continued, but in 1801 Pitt resigned from office, and in 1803 the new [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]] administration decided not to proceed with the project.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 236–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham was devastated: &quot;They have murdered my best days.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, a few years later the government revived the idea of a National Penitentiary, and in 1811 and 1812 returned specifically to the idea of a panopticon.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 265–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham, now aged 63, was still willing to be governor. However, as it became clear that there was still no real commitment to the proposal, he abandoned hope, and instead turned his attentions to extracting financial compensation for his years of fruitless effort. His initial claim was for the enormous sum of nearly £700,000, but he eventually settled for the more modest (but still considerable) sum of £23,000.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 279–81.&lt;/ref&gt; An Act of Parliament in 1812 transferred his title in the site to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Penitentiary House, etc. Act: 52 Geo. III, c. 44 (1812).&lt;/ref&gt;

More successful was his cooperation with [[Patrick Colquhoun]] in tackling the corruption in the [[Pool of London]]. This resulted in the [[Thames Police Bill (1798)|Thames Police Bill of 1798]], which was passed in 1800.{{efn|An Act for the More Effectual Prevention of Depredations on the River Thames (39 &amp; 40 Geo 3 c 87)&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot; /&gt;}} The bill created the [[Thames River Police]], which was the first preventive police force in the country and was a precedent for [[Robert Peel]]'s reforms 30 years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Everett, Charles Warren. 1969.

=== Correspondence and contemporary influences ===
Bentham was in correspondence with many influential people. In the 1780s, for example, Bentham maintained a correspondence with the aging [[Adam Smith]], in an unsuccessful attempt to convince Smith that interest rates should be allowed to freely float.{{sfn|Persky|2007|p=228}} As a result of his correspondence with [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] and other leaders of the [[French Revolution]], Bentham was declared an honorary citizen of France.{{sfn|Bentham|2002|p=291}} He was an outspoken critic of the revolutionary discourse of [[natural rights]] and of the violence that arose after the [[Jacobin]]s took power (1792). Between 1808 and 1810, he held a personal friendship with [[Latin American wars of independence|Latin American]] revolutionary [[Francisco de Miranda]] and paid visits to Miranda's Grafton Way house in London. He also developed links with [[José Cecilio del Valle]].&lt;ref name=RubénDarío-1887&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darío|first1=Rubén|title=La Literatura en Centro-América|journal=Revista de artes y letras|date=1887|volume=XI|page=591|url=http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-86857.html|access-date=25 March 2019|publisher=Biblioteca Nacional de Chile|language=es|id=MC0060418|quote=In Guatemala there was Valle, a man of vast intellect, friend of Jeremías Bentham, with whom he corresponded frequently.

===South Australian colony proposal===
Bentham contributed to a plan to [[European settlement of South Australia|found a new colony in South Australia]]: in 1831 a &quot;Proposal to His Majesty's Government for founding a colony on the Southern Coast of Australia&quot; was prepared under the auspices of [[Robert Gouger]], [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]], [[Anthony Bacon (British Army officer)|Anthony Bacon]] and Bentham, but its ideas were considered too radical, and it was unable to attract the required investment.&lt;ref name=samem&gt;{{cite web|website=SA Memory|url=https://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=349&amp;startRow=13|publisher=State Library of South Australia|title=Foundation of the Province|date=5 February 2015|access-date=19 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Westminster Review ===
In 1823, he co-founded ''[[The Westminster Review]]'' with [[James Mill]] as a journal for the &quot;[[Radicalism (historical)#Political reform|Philosophical Radicals]]&quot;—a group of younger disciples through whom Bentham exerted considerable influence in British public life.{{sfn|Hamburger|1965|p=}}{{sfn|Thomas|1979|p=}} One was [[John Bowring]], to whom Bentham became devoted, describing their relationship as &quot;son and father&quot;: he appointed Bowring political editor of ''The Westminster Review'' and eventually his [[literary executor]].{{sfn|Bartle|1963|p=}} Another was [[Edwin Chadwick]], who wrote on hygiene, sanitation and policing and was a major contributor to the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]]: Bentham employed Chadwick as a secretary and bequeathed him a large legacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|94}}

=== Old age ===
An insight into his character is given in Michael St. John Packe's ''The Life of John Stuart Mill'':

{{quote| During his youthful visits to [[Bowood House]], the country seat of his patron [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Lansdowne]], he had passed his time at falling unsuccessfully in love with all the ladies of the house, whom he courted with a clumsy jocularity, while playing [[chess]] with them or giving them lessons on the [[harpsichord]]. Hopeful to the last, at the age of eighty he wrote again to one of them, recalling to her memory the far-off days when she had &quot;presented him, in ceremony, with the flower in the green lane&quot; [citing Bentham's memoirs]. To the end of his life he could not hear of Bowood without tears swimming in his eyes, and he was forced to exclaim, &quot;Take me forward, I entreat you, to the future—do not let me go back to the past.&quot;{{sfn|Packe|1954|p=16}} }}

A [[Psychobiography|psychobiographical]] study by Philip Lucas and Anne Sheeran argues that he may have had [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's syndrome]].{{sfn|Lucas|Sheeran|2006|pp= 26–27}} Bentham was an atheist.{{sfn|Crimmins|1986|p=95}}

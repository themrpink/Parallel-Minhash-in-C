==Religious views==
Kripke is an observant Jew.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;Kripke is Jewish, and he takes this seriously. He is not a nominal Jew and he is careful keeping the Sabbath, for instance he doesn't use public transportation on Saturdays.&quot;  Andreas Saugstad, [http://goinside.com/2001/02/25/saul-kripke-genius-logician/ &quot;Saul Kripke: Genius logician&quot;], 25 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
On how his religious views influenced his philosophical views, he has said: &quot;I don't have the prejudices many have today. I don't believe in a [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] worldview. I don't base my thinking on prejudices or a worldview and do not believe in [[materialism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Saugstad, [http://goinside.com/2001/02/25/saul-kripke-genius-logician/ &quot;Saul Kripke: Genius logician&quot;], 25 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saul Kripke Center==

The Saul Kripke Center at the [[Graduate Center of the City University of New York]] is dedicated to preserving and promoting Kripke's work. Its director is Romina Padro. The Saul Kripke Center holds events related to Kripke's work and is creating a digital archive of previously unpublished recordings of Kripke's lectures, lecture notes, and correspondence dating back to the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kripkecenter.commons.gc.cuny.edu/ Saul Kripke Center website]: Most of these recordings and lecture notes were created by [[Nathan Salmon]] while he was a student and, later, a colleague of Kripke's.&lt;/ref&gt; In his favorable review of Kripke's ''Philosophical Troubles'', the [[Stanford]] philosopher Mark Crimmins wrote, &quot;That four of the most admired and discussed essays in 1970s philosophy are here is enough to make this first volume of Saul Kripke's collected articles a must-have... The reader's delight will grow as hints are dropped that there is a great deal more to come in this series being prepared by Kripke and an ace team of philosopher-editors at the Saul Kripke Center at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/43850-philosophical-troubles-collected-papers-volume-1|title=Review of Philosophical Troubles: Collected Papers, Volume 1|first=Mark|last=Crimmins|date=30 October 2013|publisher=|via=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relativism''' is a family of [[philosophical]] views which deny claims to [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] within a particular domain and assert that facts in that domain are relative to the perspective of an observer or the context in which they are assessed.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/] &quot;The label “relativism” has been attached to a wide range of ideas and positions which may explain the lack of consensus on how the term should be defined.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different forms of relativism, with a great deal of variation in scope and differing degrees of controversy among them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Baghramian]] identifies 16 (''Relativism'', 2004,Baghramian)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Moral relativism]]'' encompasses the differences in moral judgments among people and cultures.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{Cite web | last = Swoyer | first = Chris | date = February 22, 2003 | title = Relativism | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#1.2 | access-date = May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Epistemology|Epistemic relativism]]'' holds that there are no absolute facts regarding norms of [[belief]], [[Justification (epistemology)|justification]], or [[rationality]], and that there are only relative ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP Epistemic Relativism&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Epistemic Relativism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#EpiRel |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=6 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Factual relativism|Alethic relativism]]'' is the doctrine that there are no [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truths]], i.e., that truth is always relative to some particular frame of reference, such as a language or a culture ([[cultural relativism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Baghramian, Maria and Carter, Adam, &quot;Relativism&quot;, &quot;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2015 Edition)&quot;, Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/relativism/#RelAboTruAleRel/ &quot;Relativism about truth, or alethic relativism, at its simplest, is the claim that what is true for one individual or social group may not be true for another&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of relativism also bear a resemblance to [[philosophical skepticism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#BriHisOldIde&lt;/ref&gt; ''Descriptive relativism'' seeks to describe the differences among cultures and people without evaluation, while normative relativism evaluates the morality or truthfulness of views within a given framework.

==Forms of relativism==

===Anthropological versus philosophical relativism===
[[Anthropological relativism]] refers to a [[methodology|methodological]] stance, in which the researcher suspends (or brackets) his or her own cultural prejudice while trying to understand beliefs or behaviors in their contexts. This has become known as [[methodological relativism]], and concerns itself specifically with avoiding [[ethnocentrism]] or the application of one's own cultural standards to the assessment of other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

 |quote=...methodological relativism - impartial assessment of how knowledge develops - is the key idea for sociology of scientific knowledge...}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the basis of the so-called &quot;[[emic]]&quot; and &quot;[[etic]]&quot; distinction, in which:
* An ''emic'' or ''insider'' account of behavior is a description of a society in terms that are meaningful to the participant or actor's own culture; an emic account is therefore culture-specific, and typically refers to what is considered &quot;[[common sense]]&quot; within the culture under observation.
* An ''etic'' or outsider account is a description of a society by an observer, in terms that can be applied to other cultures; that is, an etic account is culturally neutral, and typically refers to the conceptual framework of the social scientist. (This is complicated when it is scientific research itself that is under study, or when there is theoretical or terminological disagreement within the social sciences.)

Philosophical relativism, in contrast, asserts that the truth of a proposition depends on the metaphysical, or theoretical frame, or the instrumental method, or the context in which the proposition is expressed, or on the person, groups, or culture who interpret the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oyloiiq0CYIC&amp;pg=PA210 Locke, Shaftesbury, and Hutcheson: Contesting Diversity in the Enlightenment and Beyond by Dr. Daniel Carey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodological relativism and philosophical relativism can exist independently from one another, but most anthropologists base their methodological relativism on that of the philosophical variety.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2796798 Methodological and Philosophical Relativism by Gananath Obeyesekere]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive versus normative relativism===
The concept of relativism also has importance both for [[philosophy|philosophers]] and for [[anthropology|anthropologists]] in another way. In general, anthropologists engage in descriptive relativism (&quot;how things are&quot; or &quot;how things seem&quot;), whereas philosophers engage in [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] relativism (&quot;how things ought to be&quot;), although there is some overlap (for example, descriptive relativism can pertain to concepts, normative relativism to truth).

Descriptive relativism assumes that certain cultural groups have different modes of thought, standards of reasoning, and so forth, and it is the anthropologist's task to describe, but not to evaluate the validity of these principles and practices of a cultural group. It is possible for an anthropologist in his or her fieldwork to be a descriptive relativist about some things that typically concern the philosopher (e.g., ethical principles) but not about others (e.g., logical principles). However, the descriptive relativist's empirical claims about epistemic principles, moral ideals and the like are often countered by anthropological arguments that such things are universal, and much of the recent literature on these matters is explicitly concerned with the extent of, and evidence for, cultural or moral or linguistic or human universals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = Donald E. |last = Brown |author-link = Donald Brown (anthropologist) |title = Human Universals |publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] |year = 1991 |isbn = 0-87722-841-8 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/culturalconnecti00voge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the various species of descriptive relativism are empirical claims, may tempt the philosopher to conclude that they are of little philosophical interest, but there are several reasons why this isn't so. First, some philosophers, notably Kant, argue that certain sorts of cognitive differences between human beings (or even all rational beings) are impossible, so such differences could never be found to obtain in fact, an argument that places a priori limits on what empirical inquiry could discover and on what versions of descriptive relativism could be true. Second, claims about actual differences between groups play a central role in some arguments for normative relativism (for example, arguments for normative ethical relativism often begin with claims that different groups in fact have different moral codes or ideals). Finally, the anthropologist's descriptive account of relativism helps to separate the fixed aspects of human nature from those that can vary, and so a descriptive claim that some important aspect of experience or thought does (or does not) vary across groups of human beings tells us something important about human nature and the human condition.

Normative relativism concerns normative or [[Value (ethics)|evaluative]] claims that modes of thought, standards of reasoning, or the like are only right or wrong relative to a framework. ‘Normative’ is meant in a general sense, applying to a wide range of views; in the case of beliefs, for example, normative correctness equals truth. This does not mean, of course, that framework-relative correctness or truth is always clear, the first challenge being to explain what it amounts to in any given case (e.g., with respect to concepts, truth, epistemic norms). Normative relativism (say, in regard to normative ethical relativism) therefore implies that things (say, ethical claims) are not simply true in themselves, but only have [[truth value]]s relative to broader frameworks (say, moral codes). (Many normative ethical relativist arguments run from premises about ethics to conclusions that assert the relativity of truth values, bypassing general claims about the nature of truth, but it is often more illuminating to consider the type of relativism under question directly.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#1.2 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related and contrasting positions==
[[Relational theory|Relationism]] is the theory that there are only relations between individual entities, and no intrinsic
properties. Despite the similarity in name, it is held by some to be a position distinct from relativism—for instance, because &quot;statements about relational properties [...] assert an absolute truth about things in the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Baghramian|Baghramian, M.]] ''Relativism'', 2004, p43&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, others wish to equate relativism, relationism and even [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], which is a precise theory of relationships between physical objects:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nakedpunch.com/6/106-108.pdf Interview with Bruno Latour''On Relativism, Pragmatism, and Critical Theory'']&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, &quot;This confluence of relativity theory with relativism became a strong contributing factor in the increasing prominence of relativism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Baghramian, M. ''Relativism'', 2004, p85&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas previous investigations of science only sought sociological or psychological explanations of failed scientific theories or pathological science, the '[[strong programme]]' is more relativistic, assessing scientific truth and falsehood equally in a historic and cultural context.

==Criticisms==
{{anchor|paradox_of_relativism}}A common argument&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/views/reality.htm Craig Rusbult. ''Reality 101'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Dixon. ''Is Cultural Relativism Self-Refuting''? (British Journal of Sociology, vol 28, No. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/cultural-relativism.htm ''Cultural Relativism'' at All About Philosophy.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friesian.com/relative.htm The Friesian School on relativism.]&lt;/ref&gt; against relativism suggests that it inherently [[self-refuting idea|contradicts, refutes, or stultifies itself]]: the statement &quot;all is relative&quot; classes either as a relative statement or as an absolute one. If it is relative, then this statement does not rule out absolutes. If the statement is [[wikt:absolute|absolute]], on the other hand, then it provides an example of an absolute statement, proving that not all truths are relative. However, this argument against relativism only applies to relativism that positions truth as relative–i.e. epistemological/truth-value relativism. More specifically, it is only extreme forms of epistemological relativism that can come in for this criticism as there are many epistemological relativists{{Who|date=July 2015}} who posit that some aspects of what is regarded as factually &quot;true&quot; are not universal, yet still accept that other universal truths exist (e.g. [[gas laws]] or moral laws).

Another argument against relativism posits a [[Natural Law]]. Simply put, the physical universe works under basic principles: the &quot;Laws of Nature&quot;. Some contend that a natural Moral Law may also exist, for example as argued by [[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;[[The God Delusion]], Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; and addressed by [[C. S. Lewis]] in &quot;[[Mere Christianity]]&quot; (1952).&lt;ref&gt;[[Mere Christianity]], Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins said &quot;I think we face an equal but much more sinister challenge from the left, in the shape of cultural relativism - the view that scientific truth is only one kind of truth and it is not to be especially privileged&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/28/dawkinschristmascardlist Richard Dawkins quoted in ''Dawkins' Christmas card list; Dawkins at the Hay Festival,'' The Guardian, 28 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Forced to exclude this too - it hangs. --&gt;&lt;!--[[Plato]] opposed relativism. He criticized the views of the [[sophist]] [[Protagoras]] in his dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Thaetetus]]''.  In a paraphrased dialogue, the philosopher [[Socrates]] argued that relativism is self-defeating with the following: &quot;My opinion is: Truth must be absolute and that you Mr. Protagoras, are absolutely in error.  Since this is indeed my opinion, then you must concede that it is true according to your philosophy.&quot;&lt;ref name=socratesdialogue/&gt;
must be absolute and that you Mr. Protagoras, are absolutely in error.  Since this is indeed my opinion, then you must concede that it is true according to your philosophy.&quot;&lt;ref name=socratesdialogue/&gt;--&gt;&lt;!-- Quite a mess. (Plato could be o'k, but 1) make it chronologically, 2) make it clear.) --&gt;&lt;!-- &quot;In Defense of Relativity.&quot; claims that Protagoras had but to respond, “but my view says that truth is relative to viewpoint, thus you have demonstrated by your very viewpoint that truth is relative,” and thus demonstrated the “truth” that truth is relative.&quot;  It goes further to state that &quot;Socrates declared that (from his view), Protagoras’ idea of relative truth is wrong, thus it is wrong relative to Socrates' view.  Protagoras merely needed to respond that from his view, truth is relative to viewpoint, his statement is therefore true from his viewpoint and false from Socrates’ viewpoint, denoting the relative truths found in their respective relative views, and thus demonstrating the relative truth of Protagoras...&quot; --&gt; &lt;!-- See above. --&gt; &lt;!-- Would you mind not corrupting other text next time? Etc. --&gt;
Philosopher [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Baghramian|Baghramian, M.]] ''Relativism'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; among others,&lt;ref&gt;Including Julien Beillard, who presents his case on the impossibility of moral relativism in the July 2013 issue of [[Philosophy Now|Philosophy Now magazine]], accessible [http://philosophynow.org/issues/97/Moral_Relativism_Is_Unintelligible here]&lt;/ref&gt; states that some forms of relativism make it impossible to believe one is in error. If there is no truth beyond an individual's [[belief]] that something is true, then an individual cannot hold their own beliefs to be false or mistaken. A related criticism is that relativizing truth to individuals destroys the distinction between truth and belief.

=====Ancient India=====
Ancient Indian philosophers [[Mahavira]] (599-527 BC) and [[Nagarjuna]] (c. 150 – c. 250 CE) made contributions to the development of philosophy regarding relativism.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]], ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, pp. 96–97. In the Nikayas the quote is found at SN 2.150.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sophism=====
[[Sophists]] are considered the founding fathers of relativism in [[Western philosophy]]. Elements of relativism emerged among the [[Sophist]]s in the 5th century [[Before Christ|BC]]. Notably, it was [[Protagoras]] who coined the phrase, &quot;Man is the measure of all things: of things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not.&quot; The thinking of the Sophists is mainly known through their opponent, [[Plato]].  In a paraphrase from Plato's dialogue ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', Protagoras said: &quot;What is true for you is true for you, and what is true for me is true for me.&quot;&lt;ref name=socratesdialogue&gt;

=====Pyrrhonism=====
[[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosophy views relativity as a reason for [[philosophical skepticism]], as it is one of the reasons that [[acatalepsy|truth cannot be grasped]]. All [[Phantasiai|perception]] is relative to a perceiver, and perception differs according to position. Hence, no particular perception can be judged as representing the truth about what is perceived. Arguments from relativity form the basis of [[trope (philosophy)| trope]] 8 of the [[Pyrrhonism#The_ten_modes_of_Aenesidemus|ten modes]] of [[Aenesidemus]] and trope 3 of the [[Pyrrhonism#The_five_modes_of_Agrippa|five modes]] of [[Agrippa the Skeptic|Agrippa]].

====Modern====

=====Bernard Crick=====
[[Bernard Crick]], a British political scientist and advocate of relativism, wrote the book ''In Defence of Politics'' (first published in 1962), suggesting the inevitability of moral conflict between people. Crick stated that only [[ethics]] could resolve such conflict, and when that occurred in public it resulted in [[politics]]. Accordingly, Crick saw the process of [[dispute resolution]], [[harms reduction]], [[mediation]] or [[peacemaking]] as central to all of moral philosophy. He became an important influence on the [[feminists]] and later on the [[Green movement|Greens]].

=====Paul Feyerabend=====
The philosopher of science [[Paul Feyerabend]] is often considered to be a relativist, though he denied being one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=156973&amp;sectioncode=39 Cooper, David E., &quot;Voodoo and the monster of science,&quot; ''Times Higher Education'', 17 March 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend argued that modern science suffers from being methodologically monistic (the belief that only a single methodology can produce [[scientific progress]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Elisabeth. &quot;Feyerabend, Mill, and Pluralism&quot;, ''Philosophy of Science'' 64, p. S397.&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend summarises his case in his work [[Against Method]] with the phrase &quot;anything goes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 3rd ed., p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

: In an aphorism [Feyerabend] often repeated, &quot;potentially every culture is all cultures&quot;. This is intended to convey that world views are not hermetically closed, since their leading concepts have an &quot;ambiguity&quot; - better, an open-endedness - which enables people from other cultures to engage with them. [...] It follows that relativism, understood as the doctrine that truth is relative to closed systems, can get no purchase.  [...] For Feyerabend, both hermetic relativism and its absolutist rival [realism] serve, in their different ways, to &quot;devalue human existence&quot;. The former encourages that unsavoury brand of political correctness which takes the refusal to criticise &quot;other cultures&quot; to the extreme of condoning murderous dictatorship and barbaric practices. The latter, especially in its favoured contemporary form of &quot;scientific realism&quot;, with the excessive prestige it affords to the abstractions of &quot;the monster 'science'&quot;, is in bed with a politics which likewise disdains variety, richness and everyday individuality - a politics which likewise &quot;hides&quot; its norms behind allegedly neutral facts, &quot;blunts choices and imposes laws&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=156973&amp;sectioncode=39 Cooper, David E., &quot;Voodoo and the monster of science,&quot; ''Times Higher Education'', 17 March 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Thomas Kuhn=====
[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]]'s philosophy of science, as expressed in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' is often interpreted as relativistic. He claimed that as well as progressing steadily and incrementally (&quot;[[normal science]]&quot;), science undergoes periodic revolutions or &quot;[[paradigm shift]]s&quot;, leaving scientists working in different paradigms with difficulty in even communicating. Thus the truth of a claim, or the existence of a posited entity is relative to the paradigm employed. However, it isn't necessary for him to embrace relativism because every paradigm presupposes the prior, building upon itself through history and so on. This leads to there being a fundamental, incremental, and referential structure of development which is not relative but again, fundamental.

:From these remarks, one thing is however certain: Kuhn is not saying that incommensurable theories cannot be compared - what they can’t be is compared in terms of a system of common measure. He very plainly says that they can be compared, and he reiterates this repeatedly in later work, in a (mostly in vain) effort to avert the crude and sometimes catastrophic misinterpretations he suffered from mainstream philosophers and post-modern relativists alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uea.ac.uk/~j339/Kuhntogo.htm Sharrock. W., Read R. ''Kuhn: Philosopher of Scientific Revolutions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

But Thomas Kuhn denied the accusation of being a relativist later in his postscript.

: scientific development is ... a unidirectional and irreversible process. Latter scientific theories are better than earlier ones for solving puzzles ... That is not a relativist's position, and it displays the sense in which I am a convinced believer in scientific progress.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that one can also read Kuhn's work as essentially positivist in its ontology: the revolutions he posits are epistemological, lurching toward a presumably 'better' understanding of an objective reality through the lens presented by the new paradigm. However, a number of passages in Structures do indeed appear to be distinctly relativist, and to directly challenge the notion of an objective reality and the ability of science to progress towards an ever-greater grasp of it, particularly through the process of paradigm change.

: In the sciences there need not be progress of another sort. We may, to be more precise, have to relinquish the notion, explicit or implicit, that changes of paradigm carry scientists and those who learn from them closer and closer to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

: We are all deeply accustomed to seeing science as the one enterprise that draws constantly nearer to some goal set by nature in advance. But need there be any such goal? Can we not account for both science’s existence and its success in terms of evolution from the community’s state of knowledge at any given time? Does it really help to imagine that there is some one full, objective, true account of nature and that the proper measure of scientific achievement is the extent to which it brings us closer to that ultimate goal?&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', p. 171.&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;

=====George Lakoff and Mark Johnson=====
[[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] define relativism in their book ''[[Metaphors We Live By]]'' as the rejection of both [[subjectivism]] and [[Metaphysical realism|metaphysical objectivism]] in order to focus on the relationship between them, i.e. the [[metaphors|metaphor]] by which we relate our current experience to our previous experience. In particular, Lakoff and Johnson characterize &quot;objectivism&quot; as a &quot;[[straw man]]&quot;, and, to a lesser degree, criticize the views of [[Karl Popper]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Aristotle]].{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

===== Robert Nozick =====
In his book ''[[Invariances]]'', [[Robert Nozick]] expresses a complex set of theories about the absolute and the relative. He thinks the absolute/relative distinction should be recast in terms of an invariant/variant distinction, where there are many things a proposition can be invariant with regard to or vary with. He thinks it is coherent for truth to be relative, and speculates that it might vary with time. He thinks necessity is an unobtainable notion, but can be approximated by robust invariance across a variety of conditions—although we can never identify a proposition that is invariant with regard to everything. Finally, he is not particularly warm to one of the most famous forms of relativism, [[moral relativism]], preferring an evolutionary account.

=====Joseph Margolis=====
[[Joseph Margolis]] advocates a view he calls &quot;robust relativism&quot; and defends it in his books: ''Historied Thought, Constructed World'', Chapter 4 (California, 1995) and ''The Truth about Relativism'' (Blackwells, 1991). He opens his account by stating that our logics should depend on what we take to be the nature of the sphere to which we wish to apply our logics. Holding that there can be no distinctions which are not &quot;privileged&quot; between the [[alethic possibility|alethic]], the [[ontic]], and the [[epistemic]], he maintains that a [[many valued logic]] just might be the most apt for [[aesthetics]] or [[history]] since, because in these practices, we are loath to hold to simple [[Principle of bivalence|binary logic]]; and he also holds that many-valued logic is relativistic. (This is perhaps an unusual definition of &quot;relativistic&quot;. Compare with his comments on &quot;relationism&quot;). &quot;True&quot; and &quot;False&quot; as mutually exclusive and exhaustive judgements on [[Hamlet]], for instance, really does seem absurd. A many valued logic—&quot;apt&quot;, &quot;reasonable&quot;, &quot;likely&quot;, and so on—seems intuitively more applicable to Hamlet interpretation. Where apparent contradictions arise between such interpretations, we might call the interpretations &quot;incongruent&quot;, rather than dubbing either &quot;false&quot;, because using many-valued logic implies that a measured value is a mixture of two extreme possibilities. Using the subset of many-valued logic, [[fuzzy logic]], it can be said that various interpretations can be represented by membership in more than one possible truth sets simultaneously. Fuzzy logic is therefore probably the best mathematical structure for understanding &quot;robust relativism&quot; and has been interpreted by [[Bart Kosko]] as philosophically being related to Zen Buddhism.

In 1951, [[No. 29 Squadron RAF|29]], [[No. 141 Squadron RAF|141]], [[No. 85 Squadron RAF|85]] and [[No. 264 Squadron RAF|264 squadrons]] each received a number of NF.11 aircraft, the first of the Meteor night fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams aerop2 p22&quot;&gt;Williams ''Aeroplane Monthly'' May 1995, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; It was rolled out across the RAF until the final deliveries in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;James p293&quot;&gt;James 1971, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;tropicalised&quot; version of the NF.11 for the Middle East was developed; first flying on 23 December 1952 as the ''NF.13''. The aircraft equipped [[No. 219 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Kabrit|Kabrit]] and No. 39 Squadron at Fayid, both in Egypt. The aircraft served during the [[Suez Crisis|Suez crisis]] and remained with No. 39 Squadron after they were withdrawn to Malta until 1958. Several problems were encountered: the heavily framed T.7 canopy made landings tricky due to limited visibility, the under-wing external fuel tanks tended to break up when the wing cannons were fired, and gun harmonisation, normally set to about 400 yards, was poor due to the wings flexing in flight. Belgium (24), Denmark (20) and France (41) were foreign customers for the NF.11.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams aero p3 p10-2&quot;&gt;Williams ''Aeroplane Monthly'' June 1995, pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-RAF NF.13s were sold to France (two), Syria (six), Egypt (six) and Israel (six).&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams aero p3 p12&quot;&gt;Williams ''Aeroplane Monthly'' June 1995, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the armed, low altitude operation, tactical FR.9 variant, Gloster also developed the ''PR.10'' for high altitude missions.&lt;ref name =&quot;bb 55&quot;&gt;Butler and Buttler 2006, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The first prototype flew on 29 March 1950 and was actually converted into the first production aircraft. Based on the F.4, it had the F.4-style tail and the longer wings of the earlier variant. All the cannons were removed and a single camera placed in the nose with two more in the rear fuselage; the canopy was also changed. The PR.10 was delivered to the RAF in December 1950 and were given to No. 2 and No. 541 squadrons in Germany and [[No. 13 Squadron RAF]] in Cyprus. The PR.10 was rapidly phased out from 1956; rapid improvements in [[surface-to-air missile]] technology and the introduction of newer aircraft capable of flying at greater altitudes and speeds had rendered the aircraft obsolete.

Argentina became the first overseas operator of the Meteor, placing an order for 100 F Mk.4s in May 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;James 262&quot;/&gt; The Meteor's procurement led to Argentina becoming the second air force in the Americas to operate jet aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The Argentine Meteors were first used in combat during the 16 June 1955 rebellion when, in an attempt to kill [[Juan Perón]], rebel-flown aircraft bombed the [[Casa Rosada]]. A loyalist Meteor shot down a rebel [[North American T-6 Texan|AT-6]], while another strafed rebel-held [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Ezeiza airport]]. The rebels seized [[Morón Airport and Air Base]], base of the Meteors, and used several captured aircraft to perform multiple attacks against loyalist forces and the Casa Rosada before the rebellion was defeated by day's end.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAPR7 p122-3&quot;&gt;Cicalesi and Rivas 2002, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second revolt, the [[Revolución Libertadora]] broke out on 16 September 1955, with, again, both sides operating the Meteor. The rebels seized three Meteors. Government Meteors flew strafing attacks against the rebel-held destroyers [[ARA La Rioja (E-4)|''Rioja'']] and [[ARA Cervantes|''Cervantes'']], and several landing ships near [[Río Santiago Shipyard|Rio Santiago]] on 16 September and attacking [[Ingeniero Aeronáutico Ambrosio L.V. Taravella International Airport|Pajas Blancas]] airport near the city of [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], damaging several [[Avro Lincoln]] bombers. The rebel-flown Meteors were used to attack loyalist forces attacking Córdoba, losing one of their number on 19 September to an engine failure caused by use of [[Gasoline|automobile petrol]] instead of [[jet fuel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IAPR7 p124&quot;&gt;Cicalesi and Rivas 2002, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquisition of [[North American F-86 Sabre]]s in 1960 allowed the remaining Meteors to be transferred to the ground attack role. In this role, the aircraft were refitted with bomb pylons and rocket rails; the bare metal colour scheme was also discarded for a camouflage scheme.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAPR7 p126&quot;&gt;Cicalesi and Rivas 2002, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AE 104 p72&quot;/&gt;

Argentine Meteors were used to attack rebels during attempted uprisings in September 1962 and April 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAPR7 p125&quot;&gt;Cicalesi and Rivas 2002, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The type was ultimately withdrawn from service in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;AE 104 p72&quot;/&gt;

===Australia===

[[File:77 Sqn (AWM JK1025).jpg|thumb|upright|No. 77 Squadron RAAF pilots and Meteor aircraft in Korea, c. 1952.]]

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) acquired 113 Meteors between 1946 and 1952, 94 of which were the F.8 variant.&lt;ref name= &quot;ADF Aircraft Serial Numbers: RAAF A77 Gloster Meteor F 8&quot;&gt;[http://www.adf-serials.com/2a77.shtml &quot;ADF Aircraft Serial Numbers: RAAF A77 Gloster Meteor F 8.&quot;] ''adf-serials.com.''

Australia's F.8s saw extensive service during the [[Korean War]] with [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF]], part of [[British Commonwealth Forces Korea]]. The squadron had personnel from the RAF and other Commonwealth air forces attached to it. It had arrived in Korea equipped with piston-engined [[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustangs]]. To match the threat posed by [[MiG-15]] jet fighters, it was decided to reequip the squadron with Meteors.&lt;ref name =&quot;bb 69&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shacklady 1962, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Jet conversion training was conducted at Iwakuni, Japan, after which the squadron returned to the Korean theatre in April 1951 with about 30 Meteor F.8s and T.7s. The squadron moved to [[Gimpo International Airport|Kimpo Air Base]] in June, and was declared combat ready the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1965, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; More advanced designs, such as the F-86 Sabre and [[Hawker P.1081]], were considered but would not be available within a realistic time frame; the Meteor proved to be considerably inferior in combat against the MiG-15 in several respects, including speed and manoeuvrability at high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1965, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 1951, 77 Squadron began operating their Meteors on combat missions. The squadron had mainly been trained in the [[Ground attack aircraft|ground attack role]], and had difficulties when assigned to bomber escort duty at sub-optimum altitudes. On 29 August 1951, eight Meteors were on escort duty in &quot;[[MiG Alley]]&quot; when they were engaged by six MiG-15s; one Meteor was lost and two damaged, and 77 Squadron did not destroy any enemy aircraft.&lt;ref name =&quot;Andrews 6&quot;&gt;Andrews 1965, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|According to anecdotal accounts, [[Warrant Officer]] Ron Guthrie destroyed a MiG-15 in this engagement.

At the end of 1951, due to the perceived superiority of the MiGs in air combat&amp;nbsp;– as well as the Meteor's favourable low-level performance and sturdy construction, RAAF commanders had 77 Squadron reassigned to ground-attack duties.&lt;ref name =&quot;Andrews 7&quot;&gt;Andrews 1965, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1952, more than a thousand sorties were flown in the ground-attack role; these sorties continued until May 1952, when 77 Squadron switched to fighter sweep operations. The last encounter between the Meteor and the MiG-15 was in March 1953, during which a Meteor piloted by Sergeant John Hale recorded a victory.&lt;ref name =&quot;Andrews 8&quot;&gt;Andrews 1965, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the conflict, the squadron had flown 4,836 missions, destroying six MiG-15s, over 3,500 structures and some 1,500 vehicles. About 30 Meteors were lost to enemy action in Korea, the vast majority shot down by anti-aircraft fire while serving in a ground-attack capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADF Aircraft Serial Numbers: RAAF A77 Gloster Meteor F 8&quot;/&gt;

The RAAF began introducing a domestically produced, [[CAC Sabre|Sabre variant]] powered by the [[Rolls-Royce Avon]], in 1955, which progressively relegated the older Meteor to training and secondary duties. A number of Meteors would be assigned to the reserve [[Citizen Air Force]], while others were configured as pilotless drone aircraft or for target towing. [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF]] was the last Australian squadron to operate the Meteor; notably, it had operated a three-unit aerobatic team, named &quot;The Meteorites&quot;.&lt;ref name =&quot;Andrews 9&quot;&gt;Andrews 1965, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;bb 70&quot;&gt;Butler and Buttler 2006, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
Although Egypt's first order for the Meteor was placed in 1948, the rising tension in the region led to the imposition of a series of arms embargoes. Twelve F Mk.4s were eventually delivered between October 1949 and May 1950,&lt;ref name=&quot;James p263&quot;&gt;James 1971, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; along with three T Mk.7s.&lt;ref name=&quot;James p270&quot;&gt;James 1971, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four F Mk.8s were ordered in 1949, but this order was stopped by an embargo. A further order for 12 ex-RAF F.8s was placed in December 1952, of which four were delivered before the order was cancelled, with the final eight being delivered in 1955,&lt;ref name=&quot;James p280&quot;&gt;James 1971, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; along with three more T Mk.7s.&lt;ref name=&quot;James p270&quot;/&gt; and six NF Mk.13s, all ex-RAF aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;James p298&quot;&gt;James 1971, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain had allowed the Meteor sales as part of an effort to foster and support good relations; tensions over the [[Suez Canal]] led to arms sales being suspended once again.&lt;ref&gt;Jabber 1981, pp. 81, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian Meteors participated in the fighting during the Suez Crisis of 1956, typically being used in ground attack missions against Israeli forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;AE112 p57&quot;&gt;Nicolle ''Air Enthusiast'' No 112, p.57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AE113 p36-7&quot;&gt;Nicolle ''Air Enthusiast'' No 113, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In one incident, an Egyptian Meteor NF Mk.13 claimed to have damaged an RAF [[Vickers Valiant]] bomber.&lt;ref name=&quot;AE113 p43&quot;&gt;Nicolle ''Air Enthusiast'' No 113, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; An aerial bombing campaign of Egyptian airfields by Anglo-French forces resulted in several aircraft being destroyed on the ground; the Egyptian Air Force subsequently withdrew from combat within the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;AE114 p54&quot;&gt;Nicolle ''Air Enthusiast'' No 114, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;aloni 24&quot;/&gt;

===Syria===
Meteors were the fledgling [[Syrian Air Force]]'s first jet aircraft. It acquired 25 of them between 1952 and 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1965, pp. 10, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the British were willing to supply aircraft, they did not supply combat training or radar. As Syria became more aligned with [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s Egypt, British support for Meteor operations was withdrawn and Syrian pilots began training with their Egyptian counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} During the Suez Crisis, the RAF performed multiple high altitude reconnaissance flights over Syria by [[English Electric Canberra]] aircraft from bases in Cyprus. Lacking radar to track the aircraft, the Syrian Air Force developed a ground spotter network that reported information by telephone in an attempt to intercept these flights. On 6 November 1956, a Syrian Meteor successfully shot down a Canberra of [[No. 13 Squadron RAF]], which crashed in Lebanon.&lt;ref name=Phoenix&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicolle|first1=David|last2=Nordeen|first2=Lon|title=Phoenix over the Nile: a history of Egyptian air power, 1932–1994|date=1996|page=346|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1560986263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Syria began to replace its Meteors with newly procured [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17s]] from the Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===France===
The [[French Air Force]] was keen to acquire jet aircraft as part of its re-equipment program following the Second World War. In 1953, 25 new-build aircraft were diverted from RAF orders to fulfil a French order; a further 16 ex-RAF NF.11s were purchased in 1954 and delivered between September 1954 and April 1955,&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams aero p3 p10-1&quot;&gt;Williams ''Aeroplane Monthly'' June 1995, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; these being supplemented by about 14 T Mk.7s.&lt;ref name=&quot;James p271-2&quot;&gt;James 1971, pp. 271–272.&lt;/ref&gt; The NF Mk.11s replaced the Mosquito night fighter with the Escadre de Chasse (EC) 30, serving with that Wing until replaced by the [[Sud Aviation Vautour]] in 1957. Several Meteors were then transferred to ECN 1/7 in Algeria, which saw combat in the [[Algerian War]], operating from [[Bône]], while others were used for training Vautour night fighter crews. The Vautour was retired from French Air Force service in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams aero p3 p11&quot;&gt;Williams ''Aeroplane Monthly'' June 1995, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams AE p49&quot;&gt;Williams 1984, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five Meteor NF.11s were transferred to the Centre d’Essais en Vol (Flight Test Centre) in 1958, where they were used as equipment testbeds and chase planes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams AE p49&quot;/&gt; and were later joined by two NF Mk.13s and two NF Mk.14s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams aero p3 p12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams aero p4 p44&quot;/&gt; The test aircraft were used in a wide variety of experiments, including radar and missile tests and during the development of [[Concorde]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams aero p3 p11-2&quot;&gt;Williams ''Aeroplane Monthly'' June 1995, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
[[File:Meteor IAF 1954.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Israeli Air Force]] Meteor in 1954]]
Due to tensions between the newly formed nation of Israel and its neighbours, both sides had commenced an arms race which led to jet aircraft being vigorously purchased by various countries in the region. In 1953 Israel ordered four '''T Mk.7'''s and 11 '''F Mk.8'''s, with delivery continuing until early 1954. The '''F Mk.8s''' were modified to carry American HVAR rockets but were otherwise identical to RAF aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;ae50 p39-0&quot;&gt;Aloni ''Air Enthusiast'' Fifty, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; A second batch of seven refurbished '''FR Mk.9s''' and two more '''T Mk.7s''' was delivered in 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;ae50 p42&quot;&gt;Aloni ''Air Enthusiast'' Fifty, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Israel purchased six NF Mk.13s, with three delivered that year, and the remaining three, delayed by an arms embargo, in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;ae50 p44&quot;&gt;Aloni ''Air Enthusiast'' Fifty, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Five more T Mk.7s were later purchased, these were converted from ex-Belgian '''F Mk.4'''s and were fitted with the '''Mk.8''' tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;ae50 p47&quot;&gt;Aloni ''Air Enthusiast'' Fifty, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jabber 1981, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 1955, an Israeli Meteor shot down an Egyptian [[de Havilland Vampire]], the first jet aircraft to be shot down in the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Aloni 2001, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Meteor played a key role during the Suez Crisis; on 28 October 1956, an Israeli NF.13 took part in [[Operation Tarnegol]], in which it successfully located and shot down an Egyptian [[Ilyushin Il-14]] that had been carrying several high-ranking Egyptian military officers on the eve of the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Yonay 1993, pp. 161–163.&lt;/ref&gt; The operation had intended to shoot down the Il-14 that was supposed to be carrying the supreme commander of the Egyptian armed forces, [[Abdel Hakim Amer]], however a different aircraft had been inadvertently attacked and destroyed instead.&lt;ref name = &quot;aloni 24&quot;&gt;Aloni 2001, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; After deploying paratroopers east of the [[Suez Canal]], the [[Israeli Air Force]] continued to support them on the ground predominantly using its jet aircraft, fearing its propeller-driven aircraft would be vulnerable against Egypt's jet fighters.&lt;ref name = &quot;aloni 24&quot;/&gt;

While initially flying [[combat air patrol]] missions, the Meteors and other Israeli aircraft could not prevent effective attacks by Egyptian aircraft on the ground forces.&lt;ref name = &quot;aloni 24&quot;/&gt; Israeli officers came to recognise that the Meteor was outclassed by Egyptian MiG-15s, and subsequently limited the Meteor's employment as a fighter against other aerial adversaries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Following the start of the Anglo-French bombing campaign against Egypian airbases, the Egyptian Air Force mostly withdrew from combat in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], allowing Israeli aircraft to operate unhindered.&lt;ref name = &quot;aloni 24&quot;/&gt;

The Mk.8s remained in front line service until 1956, and were then used as training aircraft. The NF Mk.13s remained in operational use until 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;ae50 p47-8&quot;&gt;Aloni ''Air Enthusiast'' Fifty, p. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Record setting===

Late in 1945, two F.3 Meteors were modified for an attempt on the world [[air speed record]]. On 7 November 1945 at [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay in Kent]], UK, Group Captain [[Hugh Wilson (RAF officer)|Hugh &quot;Willie&quot; Wilson]] set the first official air speed record by a jet aircraft of {{convert|606|mph|kph|abbr=on}} [[True airspeed|TAS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;James 257-8&quot;&gt;James 1971, pp. 257–258.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;bb 60&quot;&gt;Butler and Buttler 2006, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, [[Group Captain]] [[Edward Mortlock Donaldson|Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Donaldson]] broke this record with a speed of {{convert|616|mph|kph|abbr=on}} [[True airspeed|TAS]], in ''EE549'', a Meteor F.4.&lt;ref name =&quot;bb 60&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;James 258-9&quot;&gt;James 1971, pp. 258–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Sqn Ldr [[Janusz Żurakowski]] set an international speed record: London-Copenhagen-London, 4–5 April 1950 in a production standard F.8 (''VZ468''). Suitably impressed, the Danes later purchased the type.&lt;ref&gt;Zuk 2004, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another &quot;claim to fame&quot; was the Meteor's ability to perform the &quot;[[Janusz Żurakowski#Postwar|Zurabatic Cartwheel]]&quot;, an aerobatics manoeuvre named after Gloster's acting Chief Test Pilot, it was first demonstrated by Meteor [[United Kingdom aircraft test serials|G-7-1]] ''G-AMCJ'' prototype at the 1951 Farnborough Air Show;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1955/1955%20-%200731.html &quot;Mars to Javelin.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 27 May 1955. p. 729.&lt;/ref&gt; the Meteor, due to its widely set engines, could have individual engines throttled back and forward to achieve a seemingly stationary vertical cartwheel. Many Meteor pilots went on to &quot;prove their mettle&quot; by attempting the same feat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zurakowskiavroarrow.homestead.com/Biography.html &quot;Janusz Żurakowski 'Zura' 1914–2004, Biography of the World Famous Pilot.&quot;] ''zurakowskiavroarrow.homestead.com''.

Meteor F.8 ''WA820'' was adapted during 1948 to take two [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] turbojets, and from Moreton Valence, on 31 August 1951, established a time-to-height climb record. The pilot was [[Flight Lieutenant|Flt Lt]] Tom Prickett, of [[Armstrong Siddeley]].

{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2014}}
A '''transatlantic telecommunications cable''' is a [[submarine communications cable]] connecting one side of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the other. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, each cable was a single wire. After mid-century, [[coaxial cable]] came into use, with amplifiers. Late in the century, all used [[optical fiber]], and most now use [[optical amplifier]]s.

==History==
When the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] was laid in 1858 by [[Cyrus West Field]], it operated for only three weeks; subsequent attempts in 1865 and 1866 were more successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|title=The Conquest of the Atlantic |journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|date=March 2014 | volume=8 | issue=1 |pages=53–55/67|doi=10.1109/MIE.2014.2299492|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a telephone cable was discussed starting in the 1920s,{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} to be practical, it needed a number of technological advances which did not arrive until the 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Starting in 1927, transatlantic telephone service was radio-based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol14-1935/articles/bstj14-3-489.pdf Short-Wave System for Transatlantic Telephony, by Polkinghorn and Schlaack] BSTJ, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TAT-1]] (Transatlantic No. 1) was the first transatlantic telephone cable system. It was laid between Gallanach Bay, near [[Oban]], and [[Clarenville]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] between 1955 and 1956 by the [[cable ship]] ''[[CS Monarch (1945)|Monarch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Being First Telephone Cable to Connect Hemispheres&quot;]. ''Popular Mechanics'', March 1954, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956, initially carrying 36 telephone channels. In the first 24 hours of public service, there were 588 London–U.S. calls and 119 from London to Canada. The capacity of the cable was soon increased to 48 channels. Later, an additional three channels were added by use of C Carrier equipment. [[Time-assignment speech interpolation]] (TASI) was implemented on the TAT-1 cable in June 1960 and effectively increased the cable's capacity from 37 (out of 51 available channels) to 72 speech circuits. TAT-1 was finally retired in 1978. Later coaxial cables, installed through the 1970s, used [[transistor]]s and had higher bandwidth. The [[Moscow–Washington hotline]] was initially connected through this system.

[[File:The-Last-Mile-1930-B.jpg|thumb|upright|Tracy (background) in ''[[The Last Mile (play)|The Last Mile]]'' – the 1930 Broadway role that saw him scouted for Hollywood]]

In the fall of 1926, Tracy was offered his third shot at Broadway: a role in a new [[George M. Cohan]] play called ''Yellow''. Tracy swore that if the play failed to be a hit he would leave stock and work in a &quot;regular&quot; business instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 91&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy was nervous about working with Cohan, one of the most important figures in American theatre,&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 91&quot;/&gt; but during rehearsals Cohan announced, &quot;Tracy, you're the best goddamned actor I've ever seen!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 92; Deschner (1972) p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yellow'' opened on September 21; reviews were mixed but it ran for 135 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Deschner (1972) p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the beginning of an important collaboration for Tracy: &quot;I'd have quit the stage completely,&quot; he later commented, &quot;if it hadn't been for George M. Cohan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kanin (1971) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Cohan wrote a part specifically for Tracy in his next play, ''The Baby Cyclone''.&lt;ref&gt;Deschner (1972) p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on Broadway in September 1927 and was a hit.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy followed this success with another Cohan play, ''Whispering Friends'', and in 1929 took over from [[Clark Gable]] in ''Conflict'', a Broadway drama.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 109, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Other roles followed, but it was the lead in ''Dread'', written by [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning dramatist [[Owen Davis]] that gave Tracy high hopes for success.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of a man's descent into madness, ''Dread'' previewed in [[Brooklyn]] to an excellent reception, but on the next day—October 29—the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|New York stock market crashed]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to obtain funding, ''Dread'' did not open on Broadway. Following this disappointment, Tracy considered leaving the theatre and returning to Milwaukee for a more stable life.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1930, Tracy was approached about a new play called ''[[The Last Mile (play)|The Last Mile]]''. Looking to cast the lead role of a murderer on [[death row]], producer [[Herman Shumlin]] met with Tracy, and later recounted: &quot;beneath the surface, here was a man of passion, violence, sensitivity and desperation: no ordinary man, and just the man for the part.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Last Mile'' opened on Broadway in February, where Tracy's performance was met by a standing ovation that lasted 14 curtain calls.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'' described him as &quot;one of our best and most versatile young actors&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 132&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was a hit with critics,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 131; Deschner (1972) p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; and ran for 289 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 888.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fox (1930–35)===
[[File:Tracy disorderly conduct cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|With [[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]] in ''[[Disorderly Conduct (film)|Disorderly Conduct]]'' (1932), Tracy's seventh film]]

In 1930, Broadway was being heavily scouted for actors to work in the new medium of [[sound film]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 132&quot;/&gt; Tracy was cast in two [[Vitaphone]] [[short movie|shorts]] (''Taxi Talks'' and ''The Hard Guy''), but he had not considered becoming a film actor: &quot;I had no ambition in that direction and I was perfectly happy on the stage&quot;, he later explained in an interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 132&quot;/&gt; One person who saw Tracy in ''The Last Mile'' was director [[John Ford]]. Ford wanted Tracy for the lead role in his next picture, a prison movie. Production company [[Fox Film Corporation]] were unsure about Tracy, saying that he did not photograph well, but Ford convinced them that he was right for the role.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 135–137.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Up the River]]'' (1930) marked the film debut of both Tracy and [[Humphrey Bogart]]. After seeing the [[Dailies|rushes]], Fox immediately offered Tracy a long-term contract.&lt;ref&gt;Deschner (1972) p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing that he needed the money for his family—his young son was deaf and recovering from [[polio]]—Tracy signed with Fox and moved to California.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 145; Kanin (1971) p. 109, quotes Tracy talking about signing for Fox: &quot;So with me, it was just to pick up the dough I needed.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on the stage only once more in his life.

[[Winfield Sheehan]], the head of Fox, committed to making Tracy a bankable commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The studio promoted the actor, releasing adverts for his second film ''[[Quick Millions (1931 film)|Quick Millions]]'' (1931) with the headline &quot;A New Star Shines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Three films were made in quick succession, all of which were unsuccessful at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy found himself [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in [[Comedy film|comedies]], usually playing a crook or a con man.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 170, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; The mold was broken with his seventh picture, ''[[Disorderly Conduct (film)|Disorderly Conduct]]'' (1932), and it was the first of his films since ''Up the River'' to return a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1932, after nine pictures, Tracy remained virtually unknown to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 178. In a survey conducted by ''Variety'' magazine of the 133 biggest money-makers in the movie industry, Tracy did not feature.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered leaving Fox once his contract was up for renewal, but a rise in his weekly rate to $1,500 convinced him to stay.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to appear in unpopular films, with ''[[Me and My Gal]]'' (1932) setting an all-time low attendance record for the [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; He was loaned to [[Warner Bros.]] for ''[[20,000 Years in Sing Sing]]'' (1932), a prison drama co-starring [[Bette Davis]]. Tracy was hopeful that it would be his break-out role, but despite good reviews this failed to materialize.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spencer Tracy Loretta Young Man's Castle.jpg|thumb|Tracy appeared with [[Loretta Young]] in ''[[Man's Castle]]'' (1933)]]

Critics began to notice Tracy with ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]'' (1933). The story of a man's rise to prosperity had a screenplay by [[Preston Sturges]], Tracy's performance as railroad tycoon Tom Garner received uniformly strong reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 208&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Wilkerson]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote: &quot;This sterling performer has finally been given an opportunity to show an ability that has been boxed in by gangster roles&amp;nbsp;... [the film] has introduced Mr. Tracy as one of the screen's best performers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 200&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated: &quot;No more convincing performance has been given on the screen than Spencer Tracy's impersonation of Tom Garner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Shanghai Madness]]'' (1933), meanwhile, gave Tracy a previously unseen [[sex appeal]] and served to advance his standing.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 200&quot;/&gt; Despite this attention, Tracy's next two movies went largely unnoticed. ''[[Man's Castle]]'' (1933) with [[Loretta Young]] was anticipated to be a hit, but made only a small profit.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Show-Off (1934 film)|The Show-Off]]'' (1934), for which he was lent to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], proved popular, but his subsequent outings continued to be unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy drank heavily during his years with Fox, and gained a reputation as an alcoholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 208&quot;/&gt; He failed to report for filming on ''[[Marie Galante (film)|Marie Galante]]'' in June 1934, and was found in his hotel room, virtually unconscious after a two-week [[Binge drinking|binge]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy was removed from the Fox payroll while he recovered in a hospital,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; and then sued for $125,000 for delaying the production.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; He completed only two more pictures with the studio.

The details on how Tracy's relationship with Fox ended are unclear: later in life Tracy maintained that he was fired for his drunken behavior, but the Fox records do not support such an account.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; He was still under contract with the studio when MGM expressed their interest in the actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 259&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; They were in need of a new male star, and contacted Tracy on April 2, 1935, offering him a seven-year deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 259&quot;/&gt; That afternoon, the contract between Tracy and Fox was terminated &quot;by mutual consent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 259&quot;/&gt; Tracy made a total of 25 pictures in the five years he was with Fox Film Corporation, most of which lost money at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (1935–55)===

====Growing reputation====
[[File:Spencer tracy fury cropped.jpg|thumb|Tracy in [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Fury (1936 film)|Fury]]'' (1936), his first major hit]]

In the 1930s, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] was the most respected movie production studio in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; When Tracy arrived there, he was all but unknown. Biographer [[James Curtis (biographer)|James Curtis]] writes: &quot;Tracy was scarcely a blip on the box office barometer in 1935, a critics' darling and little more&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, well known for being a troublemaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 258&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Irving Thalberg]] was nevertheless enthusiastic about working with the actor, telling journalist [[Louella Parsons]]: &quot;Spencer Tracy will become one of MGM's most valuable stars.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 260&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis notes that the studio managed Tracy with care, a welcome change from the ineptitude and apathy he had known while at Fox, which was like &quot;a shot of adrenaline&quot; for the actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 260&quot;/&gt; His first film under the new contract was the quickly produced ''[[The Murder Man]]'' (1935),&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; which included the feature film debut of [[James Stewart]]. Thalberg then began a strategy of pairing Tracy with the studio's top actresses:&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Whipsaw (film)|Whipsaw]]'' (1935) co-starred [[Myrna Loy]] and was a commercial success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis 2011 p. 272&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Riffraff (1936 film)|Riffraff]]'' (1936) put Tracy opposite [[Jean Harlow]]. Both films were, however, designed and promoted to showcase their [[Leading lady|leading ladies]], thus continuing Tracy's reputation as a secondary star.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 266, 293. Deschner (1972) p. 47, quotes [[Louella Parsons]] saying: &quot;Instead of being a star himself, he was a leading man to all MGM's glamour girls.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Fury (1936 film)|Fury]]'' (1936) was the first film to prove that Tracy could make a success on his own merit.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 293&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by [[Fritz Lang]], Tracy played a man who swears revenge after narrowly escaping death by a [[Lynching|lynch mob]]. The film and performance received excellent reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; It made a profit of $1.3 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis writes: &quot;audiences who, just a year earlier, had no clear handle on him, were suddenly turning out to see him. It was a transition that was nothing short of miraculous&amp;nbsp;... [and showed] a willingness on the part of the public to embrace a leading man who was not textbook handsome nor bigger than life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 293&quot;/&gt;

''Fury'' was followed one month later with the release of the big-budget disaster movie ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'' (1936). Tracy played a [[Supporting actor|supporting role]] alongside [[Clark Gable]] in the film, allowing audiences to see him with the top male star in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis 2011 p. 272&quot;/&gt;  Taking on the role of a priest, Tracy reportedly felt a heavy responsibility in representing the church.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having only 17 minutes of screen time, Tracy was highly praised for his performance and received an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar nomination for Best Actor]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; ''San Francisco'' became the highest grossing picture of 1936.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Donald Deschner, in his book on Tracy, credits ''Fury'' and ''San Francisco'' as the &quot;two films that changed his career and gave him the status of a major star.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Deschner (1972) p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this point, Tracy entered a period of self-imposed sobriety and MGM expressed pleasure with Tracy's professionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; His public reputation continued to grow with ''[[Libeled Lady]]'' (also 1936), a [[screwball comedy]] that cast him with [[William Powell]], Loy and Harlow. According to Curtis, &quot;Powell, Harlow and Loy were among the biggest draws in the industry, and equal billing in such a powerhouse company could only serve to advance Tracy's standing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Libeled Lady'' was his third hit picture in the space of six months.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oscar wins====

Tracy appeared in four films released in 1937. ''[[They Gave Him a Gun]]'' a crime-drama, went largely unnoticed,&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 316&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; but ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'' was one of the major film events of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 316&quot;/&gt; Tracy played a Portuguese fisherman in the adventure movie, based on the novel by [[Rudyard Kipling]]. He was uncomfortable feigning a foreign accent,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; and resented having his hair curled,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; but the role was a hit with audiences and Tracy won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. ''Captains Courageous'' was followed by ''[[Big City (1937 film)|Big City]]'' with [[Luise Rainer]] and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]], the latter of which performed well at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; With two years of hit movies and industry recognition, Tracy became a star in the United States. A 1937 poll of 20 million people to find the &quot;King and Queen of Hollywood&quot; ranked Tracy sixth among males.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 333. The poll was conducted by 55 metropolitan newspapers. Ahead of Tracy in the poll were [[Clark Gable]], [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[William Powell]] and [[Nelson Eddy]].&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy was reunited with Gable and Loy for ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' (1938). The film was another commercial and critical success,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; permanently cementing the notion of Gable and Tracy as a team.

[[File:Captains courageous tracy and bartholomew.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tracy and [[Freddie Bartholomew]] in ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'' (1937)]]

Based on the positive response he had received in ''San Francisco'', MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in ''[[Boys Town (film)|Boys Town]]'' (also 1938).&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; Portraying [[Edward J. Flanagan]], a Catholic priest and founder of [[Boys Town (organization)|Boys Town]], was a role Tracy took seriously: &quot;I'm so anxious to do a good job as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps me awake at night.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: &quot;I honestly do not feel that I can accept this award&amp;nbsp;... I can accept it only as it was meant to be for a great man—Father Flanagan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did keep his Oscar, a second statuette was struck and immediately sent to Flanagan.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest box office star of 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy was absent from screens for almost a year before returning to Fox on loan and appearing as [[Henry M. Stanley]] in ''[[Stanley and Livingstone]]'' (1939) with [[Nancy Kelly]]. Curtis maintains that Tracy's non-visibility did little to affect his standing with the public or exhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1939, a ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine survey of the nation's favorite movie actors listed Tracy in first place.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Established star====

MGM capitalized on Tracy's popularity, casting him in four movies for 1940. ''[[I Take This Woman (1940 film)|I Take This Woman]]'' with [[Hedy Lamarr]] was a critical and commercial failure,&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 399&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; but the historical drama ''[[Northwest Passage (film)|Northwest Passage]]''—Tracy's first film in [[Technicolor]]—proved popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 399&quot;/&gt; He then portrayed [[Thomas Edison]] in ''[[Edison, the Man]]''. Howard Barnes of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' was not charmed by the story, but wrote that Tracy, &quot;by sheer persuasion of his acting&quot;, made the film worthy.&lt;ref&gt;Deschner (1972) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Boom Town (film)|Boom Town]]'' was the third and final Gable-Tracy picture, also starring [[Claudette Colbert]] and [[Hedy Lamarr]], making it one of the most anticipated films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; The film opened to the biggest crowd since ''[[Gone With the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy signed a new contract with MGM in April 1941, which paid $5,000 a week and limited him to three pictures a year (Tracy had previously expressed a need to reduce his workload).&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; The contract also stated for the first time that his billing was to be &quot;that of a star&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, the contract did not include a clause that he receive top billing, but from this point onward, every film Tracy appeared in featured his name in pole position.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy returned to the role of Father Flanagan for the sequel ''[[Men of Boys Town]]'' (1941). It was followed by Tracy's only venture into the horror genre, an adaptation of ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (also 1941), co-starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Lana Turner]]. Tracy was unhappy with the film, disliking the heavy make-up he needed to portray Hyde.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical response to the film was mixed.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 422–423.&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Strauss of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that &quot;Mr. Tracy's portrait of Hyde is not so much evil incarnate as it is the ham rampant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Deschner (1972) p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was financially successful, however, taking in more than $2 million at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Woman of the Year poster.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Lobby card]] for ''[[Woman of the Year]]'' (1942), the first of nine pictures Tracy made with [[Katharine Hepburn]]]]
Tracy was set to star in a film version of ''[[The Yearling]]'' for 1942, but several on-set difficulties and bad weather on location forced MGM to shelve the production. &lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of that project, he became available for the new [[Katharine Hepburn]] film, ''[[Woman of the Year]]'' (1942). Hepburn greatly admired Tracy, calling him &quot;the best movie actor there was&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Berg (2004) p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; She had wanted him for her comeback vehicle, ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940).&lt;ref&gt;Berg (2004) p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Hepburn was delighted that Tracy was available for ''Woman of the Year'', saying &quot;I was just damned grateful he was willing to work with me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;berg 171&quot;&gt;Berg (2004) p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The romantic comedy performed well at the box office and received strong reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 457&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; William Boehnel wrote in the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'', &quot;To begin with, it has Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in the leading roles. This in itself would be enough to make any film memorable. But when you get Tracy and Hepburn turning in brilliant performances to boot, you've got something to cheer about.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 457&quot;/&gt;

''Woman of the Year'' was followed by an adaptation of [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Tortilla Flat (film)|Tortilla Flat]]'' (also 1942) which met with a tepid response.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; MGM did not hesitate to repeat the teaming of Tracy and Hepburn and cast them in the dark mystery ''[[Keeper of the Flame (film)|Keeper of the Flame]]'' (1942). Despite a weak critical reception the film out-grossed ''Woman of the Year'' confirming the strength of their partnership.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 479–480; Kanin (1971) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy's next three appearances were all war-based. ''[[A Guy Named Joe]]'' (1943) with [[Irene Dunne]] surpassed ''San Francisco'' to become his highest-grossing film to date.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Seventh Cross (film)|The Seventh Cross]]'' (1944), a suspense film about an escape from a Nazi concentration camp, met with critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by the aviation film ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944). On the strength of these three releases, the annual [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll|Quigley poll]] revealed Tracy was MGM's biggest money-making star of 1944,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; His only film the following year was his third with Hepburn, ''[[Without Love (film)|Without Love]]'' (1945), a light romantic comedy that performed well at the box office despite muted enthusiasm from critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 515&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stage and screen====
[[File:Spencer tracy sea of grass.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Sea of Grass (film)|The Sea of Grass]]'' (1947)]]

In 1945, Tracy returned to the stage for the first time in 15 years. He had been through a dark patch personally—culminating with a hospital stay—and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 517 for hospital stay; p. 512 for &quot;Hepburn's strategy&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy told a journalist in April, &quot;I'm coming back to Broadway to see if I can still act.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 515&quot;/&gt; The play was ''The Rugged Path'' by [[Robert E. Sherwood]]. It first previewed in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] on September 28, to a sold-out crowd and tepid response.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 525–256.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a difficult production; director [[Garson Kanin]] later wrote: &quot;In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kanin (1971) p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 528.&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances.&lt;ref name=Deschner51&gt;Deschner (1972) p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy later explained to a friend: &quot;I couldn't say those goddamn lines over and over and over again every night&amp;nbsp;... At least every day is a new day for me in films&amp;nbsp;... But this thing—every day, every day, over and over again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy was absent from screens in 1946, the first year since his motion picture debut that there was no Spencer Tracy release.&lt;ref name=Deschner51/&gt; His next film was ''[[The Sea of Grass (film)|The Sea of Grass]]'' (1947) a melodrama set in the [[American Old West]] with Hepburn. Similarly to ''Keeper of the Flame'' and ''Without Love'', a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt; He followed it later that year with ''[[Cass Timberlane]]'', in which he played a judge. It was a commercial success, but Curtis notes that co-star Lana Turner overshadowed Tracy in most of the reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fifth film with Hepburn, [[Frank Capra]]'s political drama ''[[State of the Union (film)|State of the Union]]'', was released in 1948. Tracy played a presidential candidate in the movie, which was warmly received.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis 2011 p. 546&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 546.&lt;/ref&gt; He then appeared in ''[[Edward, My Son]]'' (1949) with [[Deborah Kerr]]. Tracy disliked the role, and told director [[George Cukor]], &quot;It's rather disconcerting to me to find how easily I play a heel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 567&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its release, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote of the &quot;hopeless miscasting of Mr. Tracy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt; The film became Tracy's biggest money-loser at MGM.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 580.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy finished off the 1940s with ''[[Malaya (film)|Malaya]]'' (1949), an adventure film with [[James Stewart]], and ''[[Adam's Rib]]'' (also 1949), a comedy with Tracy and Hepburn playing married lawyers who oppose each other in court. Tracy and Hepburn's friends, [[Garson Kanin]] and [[Ruth Gordon]], wrote the parts specifically for the two leads. The film received strong reviews and became the highest grossing Tracy-Hepburn picture to date.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote, &quot;Mr. Tracy and Miss Hepburn are the stellar performers in this show and their perfect compatibility in comic capers is delightful to see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowther |first=Bosley |title='Adam's Rib,' 'Tight Little Island,' 'Amazing Mr. Beecham' Among Movie Newcomers |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E02E5DC1F3BE23BBC4E51DFB4678382659EDE |date=December 26, 1949 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228065121/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E02E5DC1F3BE23BBC4E51DFB4678382659EDE |archivedate=December 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final MGM years====
[[File:Father of the bride 1950 promo.jpg|thumb|left|Tracy and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in a promotional image for ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' (1950). The comedic role of Stanley Banks was one of Tracy's nine Oscar-nominated performances.]]

Tracy received his first Academy Award nomination in 12 years for playing the role of Stanley Banks in ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' (1950). In the comedy film, Banks attempts to handle preparations for the upcoming wedding of his daughter ([[Elizabeth Taylor]]). &quot;It's the second strong comedy in a row for Spencer Tracy, doing the title role, and he socks it&quot;, ''Variety'' commented.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 599&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the biggest commercial success of Tracy's career to date, earning $6 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 599&quot;/&gt; MGM wanted a sequel, and while Tracy was unsure, he accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 600&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 600.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Father's Little Dividend]]'' (1951) was released ten months later and performed well at the box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 609&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 609.&lt;/ref&gt; On the strength of the two movies, Tracy polled as one of the nation's top stars once more.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 609&quot;/&gt;

Tracy portrayed a lawyer in ''[[The People Against O'Hara]]'' (1951) and  re-teamed with Hepburn for the sports comedy ''[[Pat and Mike]]'' (1952), the second feature written expressly for them by Kanin and Gordon. ''Pat and Mike'' became one of the duo's most popular and critically acclaimed films.&lt;ref&gt;Berg (2004) p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy followed it with ''[[Plymouth Adventure]]'' (also 1952), a tedious historical drama set aboard the ''[[Mayflower]]'', co-starring [[Gene Tierney]]. It met with poor critical and box office response and posted a loss of $1.8 million for MGM.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy returned to the role of a concerned father in ''[[The Actress]]'' (1953). Producer [[Lawrence Weingarten]] recalled: &quot;That film&amp;nbsp;... got more [acclaim] from the critics than any film I ever made in all the years, and we didn't make enough to pay for the ushers in the theatre.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 652.&lt;/ref&gt; For his performance in ''The Actress'', Tracy won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award]] and received a nomination for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|British Academy Film Award]].

MGM lent Tracy to Fox for the well-received [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[Broken Lance]]'', his only film released in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 674.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Tracy turned down [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[The Desperate Hours (1955 film)|The Desperate Hours]]'' because he refused to take second-billing to [[Humphrey Bogart]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Tracy appeared as a one-armed protagonist who faces the hostility of a small desert town in ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' (1955), a film directed by [[John Sturges]]. For his work, Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]] prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

Tracy had personally been unhappy with the picture, and threatened to leave during production.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 670 for threatening to leave; p. 680 for negativity toward the film.&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior became a regular occurrence for Tracy, who was increasingly lethargic and cynical. He began production on ''[[Tribute to a Bad Man]]'' in the summer of 1955, but pulled out when he claimed that the shooting location in the [[Colorado]] mountains  gave him [[altitude sickness]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; The problems caused by the picture fractured Tracy's relationship with MGM. In June 1955, he was one of the two last remaining stars of the studio's peak years (the other being [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]), but with his contract up for renewal, Tracy opted to freelance for the first time in his movie career.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 689.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent player (1956–67)===
Tracy's first post-MGM appearance was in ''[[The Mountain (1956 film)|The Mountain]]'' (1956) with [[Robert Wagner]], who played his much younger brother (Wagner had earlier played his son in ''Broken Lance''). The [[location filming]] in the French Alps proved a difficult experience, and he threatened to leave the project.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 695.&lt;/ref&gt; His performance earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Foreign Actor. Tracy and Hepburn then paired together for the eighth time in the office-based comedy ''[[Desk Set]]'' (1957). He again had to be convinced to stay with the film&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 723.&lt;/ref&gt; which met with a weak response.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Last Hurrah poster.jpg|thumb|Lobby card for [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Last Hurrah (1958 film)|The Last Hurrah]]'' (1958)]]

Tracy appeared in ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]'' (1958), a project that had been in development for five years. An adaptation of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s [[The Old Man and the Sea|novella of the same title]], Hemingway's agent, [[Leland Hayward]], had previously written to the author: &quot;Of all Hollywood people, the one that comes the closest to me in quality, in personality and voice, in personal dignity and ability, is Spencer Tracy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 644&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 644.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy was delighted to be offered the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 644&quot;/&gt; He was told to lose some of his 210 pounds before filming began, but failed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 707, 732.&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway thus reported that Tracy was a &quot;terrible liability to the picture&quot;, and had to be reassured that the star was being carefully photographed to disguise his weight problem.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 732.&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing alone on screen for most of the film, Tracy considered ''The Old Man and the Sea'' the toughest part he ever played.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 725.&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing the performance, Jack Moffitt of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said it was &quot;so intimate and revealing of universal human experience that, to me, it almost transcended acting and became reality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 748.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy received Oscar and BAFTA Award nominations for the work.

After abandoning two projects, including a proposed remake of ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' with [[Marilyn Monroe]],&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 738–739. The second film was ''Ten North Frederick''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy's next feature was ''[[The Last Hurrah (1958 film)|The Last Hurrah]]'' (1958). It reunited him with his debut director, John Ford, after 28 years and his childhood friend Pat O'Brien. Tracy took a year to commit to the project, in which he played an Irish-American mayor seeking re-election.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 741&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 741. John Ford comment: &quot;When I say Spencer Tracy is the best actor we ever had, I'm giving you something of my philosophy on acting. The best is most natural.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was favorably reviewed, but not commercially successful.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 752.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1958, the [[National Board of Review]] named Tracy the year's [[National Board of Review Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. He nevertheless began to ponder retirement, with Curtis writing that he was &quot;chronically tired, unhappy, ill, and uninterested in work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 745.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stanley Kramer partnership====
[[File:Inherit the wind trailer (3) Spencer Tracy.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1960), the first of four films Tracy made with [[Stanley Kramer]], depicted the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes &quot;Monkey Trial&quot;]] of 1925]]

Tracy did not appear on the screen again until the release of ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1960), a film based on the 1925 [[Scopes Trial|Scopes &quot;Monkey Trial&quot;]] which debated the right to teach evolution in schools. Director [[Stanley Kramer]] sought Tracy for the role of lawyer Henry Drummond (based on [[Clarence Darrow]]), from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 750.&lt;/ref&gt; Starring opposite Tracy was [[Fredric March]], a pairing ''Variety'' described as &quot;a stroke of casting genius&amp;nbsp;... Both men are spellbinders in the most laudatory sense of the word.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 768&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 768.&lt;/ref&gt; The film garnered Tracy some of the strongest reviews of his career—he was nominated for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award for the performance—but it was not a commercial hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 769&quot;&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 769.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the volcano [[disaster movie]] ''[[The Devil at 4 O'Clock]]'' (1961), Tracy played a priest for the fourth time in his career. His co-star, [[Frank Sinatra]], ceded top-billing to guarantee Tracy for the picture.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 767.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing his pattern of indecisiveness,&lt;ref&gt;Deschner (1972), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy briefly pulled out of the production before recommitting.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis 768&quot;/&gt; Critics were unenthusiastic about the film, which was nevertheless Tracy's most successful box-office outing since ''Father of the Bride''.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 798.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Inherit the Wind'' began an enduring collaboration between Stanley Kramer and Tracy—Kramer directed Tracy's three final films. ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', released at the end of 1961, was their second feature together.  The film depicts the &quot;[[Judges' Trial]]&quot;, the trial of Nazi judges for their role in the [[Holocaust]]. [[Abby Mann]] wrote the role of Judge Haywood with Tracy in mind;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy called it the best script he had ever read.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 774.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the film, Tracy delivered a 13-minute speech. He recorded it in one take, and received a round of applause from the cast and crew.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 794.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon seeing the film, Mann wrote to Tracy: &quot;Every writer ought to have the experience of having Spencer Tracy do his lines. There is nothing in the world quite like it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 796.&lt;/ref&gt; The film met with positive reviews and a large audience; Tracy received an eighth Oscar nomination for his performance.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 803.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tracy guess whos coming to dinner.jpg|thumb|upright|In ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967). Tracy died 17 days after filming was completed.]]

Tracy turned down roles in ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night (1962 film)|Long Day's Journey into Night]]'' (1962) and ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|The Leopard]]'' (1963),&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 797.&lt;/ref&gt; and had to pull out of MGM's all-star ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962) when it clashed with ''Judgment at Nuremberg''. He was, however, able to record the film's narration track.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 806.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tracy was [[#Illness and death|in very poor health by this time]], and working became a challenge. In 1962, he took the role of Captain T. G. Culpeper in Kramer's comedy ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), a small but key part that he was able to complete in nine days.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 811.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy's name topped the list of performers, and the comedy became [[List of American films of 1963|one of the highest grossing American films of the year]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) p. 818.&lt;/ref&gt;  As his health worsened, he had to cancel commitments to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'' (1965).&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2011) pp. 818, 822. Both roles eventually went to [[Edward G. Robinson]].&lt;/ref&gt; Offers continued to come, but Tracy did not work again until 1967 when he took the starring role in Kramer's ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), Tracy's ninth and final film with Hepburn.

{{quote|If the facade of a building, or a place, or a landscape is illuminated by the sun and a small hole is drilled in the wall of a room in a building facing this, which is not directly lighted by the sun, then all objects illuminated by the sun will send their images through this aperture and will appear, upside down, on the wall facing the hole.
You will catch these pictures on a piece of white paper, which placed vertically in the room not far from that opening, and you will see all the above-mentioned objects on this paper in their natural shapes or colors, but they will appear smaller and upside down, on account of crossing of the rays at that aperture.

Da Vinci was clearly very interested in the camera obscura: over the years he drew circa 270 diagrams of the camera obscura in his notebooks . He systematically experimented with various shapes and sizes of apertures and with multiple apertures (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 24, 28 and 32). He compared the working of the eye to that of the camera obscura and seemed especially interested in its capability of demonstrating basic principles of optics: the inversion of images through the pinhole or pupil, the non-interference of images and the fact that images are &quot;all in all and all in every part&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sumscorp.com/leonardo_studies/news_98.html |title=Leonardo and the Camera Obscura / Kim Veltman |publisher=Sumscorp.com |date=2 December 1986 |accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known published drawing of a camera obscura is found in Dutch physician, mathematician and instrument maker [[Gemma Frisius]]’ 1545 book ''De Radio Astronomica et Geometrica'', in which he described and illustrated how he used the camera obscura to study the solar eclipse of 24 January 1544&lt;ref name=Repstad/&gt;

Italian polymath [[Gerolamo Cardano]] described using a glass disc – probably a [[biconvex lens]] – in a camera obscura in his 1550 book ''De subtilitate, vol. I, Libri IV''. He suggested to use it to view &quot;what takes place in the street when the sun shines&quot; and advised to use a very white sheet of paper as a projection screen so the colours wouldn't be dull.&lt;ref name=Ilardi /&gt;

Sicilian mathematician and astronomer [[Francesco Maurolico]] (1494–1575) answered Aristotle's problem how sunlight that shines through rectangular holes can form round spots of light or crescent-shaped spots during an eclipse in his treatise ''Photismi de lumine et umbra'' (1521–1554). However this wasn't published before 1611,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Photismi de lumine et umbra|year=1611|last=Maurolico|first=Francesco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ug6ywn-D9BgC&amp;pg=PP9}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Johannes Kepler had published similar findings of his own.

Italian polymath [[Giambattista della Porta]] described the camera obscura, which he called &quot;obscurum cubiculum&quot;, in the 1558 first edition of his book series ''[[Magia Naturalis]]''. He suggested to use a convex mirror to project the image onto paper and to use this as a drawing aid. Della Porta compared the human eye to the camera obscura: &quot;For the image is let into the eye through the eyeball just as here through the window&quot;. The popularity of Della Porta's books helped spread knowledge of the camera obscura.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamshakespeare-sonnets.com/sonnet-24|last=Larsen|first=Kenneth|title=Sonnet 24|access-date=2 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707173823/http://www.williamshakespeare-sonnets.com/sonnet-24|archive-date=7 July 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durbin|first=P.T.|year=2012|title=Philosophy of Technology|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2OSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|isbn=9789400923034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1567 work ''La Pratica della Perspettiva'' Venetian nobleman [[Daniele Barbaro]] (1513-1570) described using a camera obscura with a biconvex lens as a drawing aid and points out that the picture is more vivid if the lens is covered as much as to leave a circumference in the middle.&lt;ref name=Ilardi&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes|publisher=American Philosophical Society|last=Ilardi|first=Vincent|year=2007|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_peIL7hVQUmwC|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_peIL7hVQUmwC/page/n231 220]|isbn=9780871692597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his influential and meticulously annotated Latin edition of the works of Ibn al-Haytham and Witelo {{lang|la|Opticae thesauru}} (1572) German mathematician [[Friedrich Risner]] proposed a portable camera obscura drawing aid; a lightweight wooden hut with lenses in each of its four walls that would project images of the surroundings on a paper cube in the middle.

Around 1575 Italian Dominican priest, mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer [[Ignazio Danti]] designed a camera obscura gnomon and a meridian line for the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella]], Florence and he later had a massive gnomon built in the [[San Petronio Basilica]] in Bologna. The gnomon was used to study the movements of the sun during the year and helped in determining the new Gregorian calendar for which Danti took place in the commission appointed by [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope Gregorius XIII]] and instituted in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cassini|title=1655–2005: 350 Years of the Great Meridian Line|url=http://stelle.bo.astro.it/archivio/2005-anno-cassiniano/meridian_ing.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This leaves the image reversed, but would become common practice in later camera obscura boxes.&lt;ref name=Ilardi /&gt;

Giambattista della Porta added a &quot;lenticular crystal&quot; or biconvex lens to the camera obscura description in the 1589 second edition of ''Magia Naturalis''. He also described use of the camera obscura to project hunting scenes, banquets, battles, plays, or anything desired on white sheets. Trees, forests, rivers, mountains &quot;that are really so, or made by Art, of Wood, or some other matter&quot; could be arranged on a plain in the sunshine on the other side of the camera obscura wall. Little children and animals (for instance handmade deer, wild boars, rhinos, elephants, and lions) could perform in this set. &quot;Then, by degrees, they must appear, as coming out of their dens, upon the Plain: The Hunter he must come with his hunting Pole, Nets, Arrows, and other necessaries, that may represent hunting: Let there be Horns, Cornets, Trumpets sounded: those that are in the Chamber shall see Trees, Animals, Hunters Faces, and all the rest so plainly, that they cannot tell whether they be true or delusions: Swords drawn will glister in at the hole, that they will make people almost afraid.&quot; 
Della Porta claimed to have shown such spectacles often to his friends.

[[File:Kepler - Ad Vitellionem paralipomena quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur, 1604 - 158093 F.jpg|thumb|left|The first use of the term ''&quot;camera obscura&quot;'' was by [[Johannes Kepler]], in his first treatise about optics, ''Ad Vitellionem paralipomena quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur'' (1604)&lt;ref name=&quot;Dupre&quot; /&gt;]]
[[File:1619 Scheiner - Oculus hoc est (frontispiece).jpg|thumb|Detail of Scheiner's ''Oculus hoc est'' (1619) frontispiece with a camera obscura's projected image reverted by a lens.]]
The earliest use of the term &quot;camera obscura&quot; is found in the 1604 book ''Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena'' by German mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dupre&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dupre |first1=Sven |title=Inside the &quot;Camera Obscura&quot;: Kepler's Experiment and Theory of Optical Imagery |journal=Early Science and Medicine |date=2008 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=219–244 |jstor=20617729|doi=10.1163/157338208X285026 |hdl=1874/33285 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler discovered the working of the camera obscura by recreating its principle with a book replacing a shining body and sending threads from its edges through a many-cornered aperture in a table onto the floor where the threads recreated the shape of the book. He also realized that images are &quot;painted&quot; inverted and reversed on the retina of the eye and figured that this is somehow corrected by the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theories of Vision from Al-kindi to Kepler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8A_auBvyFoC&amp;q=kepler+camera+obscura+eye&amp;pg=PA186|last=Lindberg|first=David C.|year=1981|isbn = 9780226482354}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1607, Kepler studied the sun in his camera obscura and noticed a [[sunspot]], but he thought it was Mercury transiting the sun.&lt;ref name =aps&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201503/physicshistory.cfm|title=March 9, 1611: Dutch astronomer Johannes Fabricius observes sunspots}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his 1611 book ''Dioptrice'', Kepler described how the projected image of the camera obscura can be improved and reverted with a lens. It is believed he later used a telescope with three lenses to revert the image in the camera obscura.&lt;ref name=Ilardi /&gt;

In 1611, Frisian/German astronomers [[David Fabricius|David]] and [[Johannes Fabricius]] (father and son) studied sunspots with a camera obscura, after realizing looking at the sun directly with the telescope could damage their eyes.&lt;ref name =aps/&gt; They are thought to have combined the telescope and the camera obscura into camera obscura telescopy.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 1612, Italian mathematician [[Benedetto Castelli]] wrote to his mentor, the Italian astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher, and mathematician [[Galileo Galilei]] about projecting images of the sun through a [[telescope]] (invented in 1608) to study the recently discovered sunspots. Galilei wrote about Castelli's technique to the German Jesuit priest, physicist, and astronomer Christoph Scheiner.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse/&gt;

[[File:Sheiner Viewing Sunspots 1625.jpg|left|thumb|Scheiner's helioscope as illustrated in his book ''Rosa Ursina sive Sol'' (1626–30)]]
From 1612 to at least 1630, [[Christoph Scheiner]] would keep on studying sunspots and constructing new telescopic solar-projection systems. He called these &quot;Heliotropii Telioscopici&quot;, later contracted to [[helioscope]].&lt;ref name=Whitehouse&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eHgCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=castelli&amp;pg=PT82|title=The Sun: A Biography|last=Whitehouse|first=David|year=2004|isbn=9781474601092}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his helioscope studies, Scheiner built a box around the viewing/projecting end of the telescope, which can be seen as the oldest known version of a box-type camera obscura.

Dutch inventor [[Cornelis Drebbel]] is thought to have constructed a box-type camera obscura which corrected the inversion of the projected image. In 1622, he sold one to the Dutch poet, composer, and diplomat [[Constantijn Huygens]] who used it to paint and recommended it to his artist friends.&lt;ref name=Snyder/&gt; Huygens wrote to his parents (translated from French):{{quote|I have at home Drebbel's other instrument, which certainly makes admirable effects in painting from reflection in a dark room; it is not possible for me to reveal the beauty to you in words; all painting is dead by comparison, for here is life itself or something more elevated if one could articulate it.

German [[oriental studies|Orientalist]], mathematician, inventor, poet, and librarian [[Daniel Schwenter]] wrote in his 1636 book ''Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae'' about an instrument that a man from [[Pappenheim]] had shown him, which enabled movement of a lens to project more from a scene through the camera obscura. It consisted of a ball as big as a fist, through which a hole (AB) was made with a lens attached on one side (B). This ball was placed inside two-halves of part of a hollow ball that were then glued together (CD), in which it could be turned around. This device was attached to a wall of the camera obscura (EF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel|last=Schwenter|year=1636|page=255|language=German|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EWM_AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;pg=GBS.PA255|title=Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[universal joint]] mechanism was later called a [[scioptric ball]].

In his 1637 book ''Dioptrique'' French philosopher, mathematician and scientist [[René Descartes]] suggested placing an eye of a recently dead man (or if a dead man was unavailable, the eye of an ox) into an opening in a darkened room and scraping away the flesh at the back until one could see the inverted image formed on the retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSUUONfamiEC&amp;pg=PA36|title=Theatre and Performance Design: A Reader in Scenographyy|last1=Collins|first1=Jane|year=2012|first2=Andrew|last2=Nisbet|isbn=9781136344527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1642 Mario Bettini - Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematica.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a twelve-hole camera obscura from Bettini's ''Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematicae&quot; (1642)]]
Italian Jesuit philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer [[Mario Bettinus|Mario Bettini]] wrote about making a camera obscura with twelve holes in his ''Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematicae'' (1642). When a foot soldier would stand in front of the camera, a twelve-person army of soldiers making the same movements would be projected.

French mathematician, [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friar]], and painter of [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic art]] [[Jean François Niceron|Jean-François Nicéron]] (1613–1646) wrote about the camera obscura with convex lenses. He explained how the camera obscura could be used by painters to achieve perfect perspective in their work. He also complained how charlatans abused the camera obscura to fool witless spectators and make them believe that the projections were magic or occult science. These writings were published in a posthumous version of ''La Perspective Curieuse'' (1652).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_7xMOAAAAQAAJ|title=La Perspective curieuse|publisher=Chez la veufue F.

===1650 to 1800: Introduction of the magic lantern, popular portable box-type drawing aid, painting aid===
The use of the camera obscura to project special shows to entertain an audience seems to have remained very rare. A description of what was most likely such a show in 1656 in France, was penned by the poet [[Jean Loret]]. The Parisian society were presented with upside-down images of palaces, ballet dancing and battling with swords. The performance was silent and Loret was surprised that all the movements made no sound. Loret felt somewhat frustrated that he did not know the secret that made this spectacle possible. There are several clues that this was a camera obscura show, rather than a very early [[magic lantern]] show, especially in the upside-down image and the energetic movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magiclantern.org.uk/new-magic-lantern-journal/pdfs/4008787a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

German Jesuit scientist [[Gaspar Schott]] heard from a traveler about a small camera obscura device he had seen in Spain, which one could carry under one arm and could be hidden under a coat. He then constructed his own sliding box camera obscura, which could focus by sliding a wooden box part fitted inside another wooden box part. He wrote about this in his 1657 ''Magia universalis naturæ et artis'' (volume 1 – book 4 &quot;Magia Optica&quot; pages 199–201).

By 1659 the [[magic lantern]] was introduced and partly replaced the camera obscura as a projection device, while the camera obscura mostly remained popular as a drawing aid. The magic lantern can be seen as a development of the (box-type) camera obscura device.

The 17th century [[Dutch Masters]], such as [[Johannes Vermeer]], were known for their magnificent attention to detail. It has been widely speculated that they made use of the camera obscura,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; but the extent of their use by artists at this period remains a matter of fierce contention, recently revived by the [[Hockney–Falco thesis]].&lt;ref name=Snyder/&gt;

[[File:1676 Johann Sturm - Camerae Obscurae Portatilis.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a portable camera obscura device from [[Johann Sturm]], ''[[Collegium Experimentale]]'' (1676)]]
German philosopher [[Johann Sturm]] published an illustrated article about the construction of a portable camera obscura box with a 45° mirror and an oiled paper screen in the first volume of the proceedings of the [[Collegium Curiosum]], ''Collegium Experimentale, sive Curiosum'' (1676).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbMWAAAAQAAJ|title=Collegium experimentale, sive curiosum |first=Johann |last=Sturm |year=1676 |language=Latin |pages=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Zahn]]'s ''Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus Sive Telescopium'', published in 1685, contains many descriptions, diagrams, illustrations and sketches of both the camera obscura and the [[magic lantern]]. A hand-held device with a mirror-reflex mechanism was first proposed by [[Johann Zahn]] in 1685, a design that would later be used in photographic cameras.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientist Robert Hooke presented a paper in 1694 to the Royal Society, in which he described a portable camera obscura. It was a cone-shaped box which fit onto the head and shoulders of its user.&lt;ref&gt;Wenczel, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 18th century, craftsmen and opticians would make camera obscura devices in the shape of books, which were much appreciated by lovers of optical devices.&lt;ref name=Mannoni1 /&gt;

One chapter in the Conte [[Francesco Algarotti|Algarotti's]] ''Saggio sopra Pittura'' (1764) is dedicated to the use of a camera ottica (&quot;optic chamber&quot;) in painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Francesco| last= Algarotti | year=1764 | title= ''Saggio sopra la pittura'' | editor= Presso Marco Coltellini, Livorno| pages= 59–63 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SNY9AAAAcAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century, following developments by [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Robert Hooke]], more easily portable models in boxes became available. These were extensively used by amateur artists while on their travels, but they were also employed by professionals, including [[Paul Sandby]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]], whose camera (disguised as a book) is now in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum in London]]. Such cameras were later adapted by [[Joseph Nicephore Niepce]], [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[William Fox Talbot]] for creating the first photographs.

While the technical principles of the camera obscura have been known since antiquity, the broad use of the technical concept in producing images with a [[linear perspective]] in paintings, maps, theatre setups, and architectural, and, later, photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution. While, e.g., [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) had already observed an optical effect and developed a state of the art theory of the refraction of light, he was less interested to produce images with it (compare [[Hans Belting]] 2005); the society he lived in was even hostile (compare [[Aniconism in Islam]]) toward personal images.&lt;ref name=&quot;belt&quot;&gt;Hans Belting Das echte Bild.

      <text bytes="724" xml:space="preserve">'''Green money''' refers to:

* [[Money]] used for [[ecological]] purposes ('''ecocurrency'''). It is broadly used in the context of [[green economists]], [[low carbon economy]] and political [[green movement|Greens]].
*Throughout the [[Middle East]], '''Green money''' refers to money from [[Islam]]ic businesses, Islamic banks, and the religious sector.
*The [[European Union]] did at one time (and may still now) have green money for [[agricultural]] accounting.

The term should not be confused with the [[nickname]] &quot;[[United States Note|greenback]]&quot; for the [[U.S. Dollar]], which is printed with green ink.

Man raised his sword, once God had gone,
To slay his brother, and the roar
Of battlefields now casts upon
Our homes the shadow of the war.

The harps to which we sang are hung,
On willow boughs, and their refrain
Drowned by the anguish of the young
Whose blood is mingled with the rain.&lt;ref name=llwyd&gt;[[Alan Llwyd]], ''Out of the Fire of Hell: Welsh Experience of the Great War 1914–1918 in Prose and Verse'', Gomer Press, 2008 .&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p233}}}}

Although farm work was classed as a [[reserved occupation]] due its national importance, in 1916 the Evans family were required to send one of their sons to join the [[British Army]]. The 29-year-old Ellis enlisted rather than his younger brother Robert. In February 1917, he received his training at Litherland Camp, [[Liverpool]], but in March 1917 the government called for farm workers to help with ploughing and many soldiers were temporarily released. Hedd Wyn was given seven weeks' leave. He spent most of this leave working on the [[awdl]] ''[[Yr Arwr]]'' (&quot;The Hero&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.books.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~alwyn/Cerddibugail/yr_arwr.shtml Full text] {{in lang|cy}}.&lt;/ref&gt; his submission for the National Eisteddfod. According to his nephew, Gerald Williams, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It was a wet year in 1917. He came back for fourteen days leave and wrote the poem, ''Yr Arwr'', on the table by the fire. As it was such a wet year, he stayed for another seven days. This extra seven days made him a [[deserter]]. So the [[Royal Military Police|military police]] came to fetch him from the hayfield and took him to the jail at [[Blaenau Ffestiniog|Blaenau]]. From there he travelled to... the war in [[Belgium]]. Because he left in such a hurry he forgot the poem on the table, so he wrote it again on the journey. So there are two copies: one in [[Aberystwyth]] and one in [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/2056/ |title=National Library of Wales interviews Gerald Williams |publisher=Museumwales.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320072246/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/2056/ |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 1917, Hedd Wyn joined the 15th Battalion [[Royal Welch Fusiliers|Royal Welsh Fusiliers]] (part of the [[38th (Welsh) Infantry Division|38th (Welsh) Division]]) at [[Fléchin]], [[France]]. His arrival depressed him, as exemplified in his quote, &quot;Heavy weather, heavy soul, heavy heart. That is an uncomfortable trinity, isn’t it?&quot; Nevertheless, at Fléchin he finished his National Eisteddfod entry and signed it “[[Fleur de Lys|Fleur de Lis]]”. It is believed it was sent via the [[Royal Mail]]  around the end of June. On 31 July the 15th Battalion marched towards the major offensive which would become known as the [[Battle of Passchendaele]].

===Third Battle of Ypres and death===
[[File:Hedd Wyn Grave at Artillery Wood Cemetery 7.jpg|thumb|upright|The grave of Hedd Wyn at [[Artillery Wood Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery|Artillery Wood Cemetery]], [[Boezinge|Boezinge, Belgium]].]]
Hedd Wyn was fatally wounded within the first few hours of the start of the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] on 31 July 1917. He fell during the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge]] which had begun at 3:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. with a heavy bombardment of the German lines (this was the opening attack in what became known as [[Battle of Passchendaele]]). However, the troops' [[Trench warfare|advance]] was hampered by incoming artillery and machine gun fire, and by heavy rain turning the battlefield to swamp.

Private Evans, as part of the 15th (Service) Battalion (1st London Welsh), was advancing towards a German strongpoint &amp;ndash;created within the ruins of the Belgian hamlet of Hagebos (&quot;Iron Cross&quot;)&amp;ndash; when he was hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagebos&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-21439931|title=Flanders community remembers Welsh dead in 'dark days' of World War I|publisher=BBC NEWS|date= 13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1975 interview conducted by [[St Fagans National Museum of History|St Fagans National History Museum]], Simon Jones, a veteran of the [[Royal Welsh Fusiliers]], recalled, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We started over Canal Bank at [[Ypres]], and he was killed half way across Pilckem. I've heard many say that they were with Hedd Wyn and this and that, well I was with him... I saw him fall and I can say that it was a nosecap shell in his stomach that killed him. You could tell that... He was going in front of me, and I saw him fall on his knees and grab two fistfuls of dirt... He was dying, of course... There were stretcher bearers coming up behind us, you see. There was nothing – well, you'd be breaking the rules if you went to help someone who was injured when you were in an attack.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1920/ |title=Welsh bard falls in the battle fields of Flanders |publisher=Museumwales.ac.uk |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621234348/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1920 |archive-date=21 June 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soon after being wounded, Hedd Wyn was carried to a first-aid post. Still conscious, he asked the doctor &quot;Do you think I will live?&quot; though it was clear that he had little chance of surviving; he died at about 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Among the fatalities that day was the [[Irish people|Irish]] [[war poet]], [[Francis Ledwidge]], who was &quot;blown to bits&quot; while drinking tea in a shell hole.

==Legacy==
===National Eisteddfod===
On 6 September 1917, the ceremony of [[Chairing of the Bard]] took place at the National Eisteddfod, held that year at [[Birkenhead Park]], in England. [[David Lloyd George]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], a Welsh-speaker, was present. After the adjudicators announced the entry submitted under the pseudonym ''[[Fleur de Lys]]'' was the winner, the trumpets were sounded for the author to identify themselves. After three such summons, [[Archdruid]] [[Evan Rees (Dyfed)|Dyfed]] solemnly announced that the winner had been killed in action six weeks earlier. The empty chair was then draped in a black sheet. It was delivered to Evans' parents in the same condition, &quot;the festival in tears and the poet in his grave&quot;, as Archdruid Dyfed said. The festival is now referred to as &quot;''Eisteddfod y Gadair Ddu''&quot; (&quot;The Eisteddfod of the Black Chair&quot;).

The chair was hand-crafted by [[Flemish|Flemish craftsman]], Eugeen Vanfleteren (1880–1950), a carpenter born in [[Mechelen]], [[Belgium]], who had fled to England on the outbreak of war and had settled in Birkenhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dehandschutter|first= Lieven|year=2001|title= Hedd Wyn. A Welsh tragedy in Flanders|publisher= Vormingscentrum Lodewijk Dosfel (Gent, Flanders, Belgium|page= 47|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis H. Evans was buried at [[Artillery Wood]] Cemetery, near [[Boezinge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/100906|title= Casualty details—Evans, Ellis Humphrey|publisher= [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]|accessdate= 1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a petition was submitted to the [[Imperial War Graves Commission]] after the war, his headstone was given the additional words ''Y [[Prifardd]] Hedd Wyn'' (English: &quot;The Chief Bard, Hedd Wyn&quot;).

===Manuscripts and publications===
[[File:Hedd Wyn statue.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Statue of Hedd Wyn in his home village of [[Trawsfynydd]].]]
Immediately after the Eisteddfod, a committee was formed in Trawsfynydd to look after the poet's legacy. Under the leadership of J. R. Jones, the head teacher of the village school, all manuscripts in the poet's hand were collected and carefully preserved. Due to the committee's efforts, the first anthology of the bard's work, titled ''Cerddi'r Bugail'' (&quot;The Shepherd's Poems&quot;), was published in 1918. The manuscripts were donated to the [[National Library of Wales]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=3790 |title=National Library's Page on Hedd Wyn |publisher=Llgc.org.uk |date=1917-07-31 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hedd Wyn, Ei Farddoniaeth'', a complete Welsh language anthology of his works, was published by Trawsfynydd's Merilang Press in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=1–184|publisher= Merilang Press|year= 2012|title=Hedd Wyn, Ei Farddoniaeth|isbn=978-0956937919|author=	Ellis Humphrey Evans|editor= Daffni Percival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem ''Yr Arwr'' (&quot;The Hero&quot;), for which Hedd Wyn won the National Eisteddfodd, is still considered his greatest work. The ode is structured in four parts and presents two principal characters, ''Merch y Drycinoedd'' (&quot;Daughter of the Tempests&quot;) and the ''Arwr''. There has been much disagreement in the past regarding the meaning of the ode. It can be said with certainty that Hedd Wyn, like his favourite poet Shelley, longed for a perfect humanity and a perfect world during the chaos of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.books.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~alwyn/Cerddibugail/yr_arwr.shtml |title=Full text (in Welsh) |publisher=Freepages.books.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Merch y Drycinoedd'' has been perceived as a symbol of love, the beauty of nature, and creativity; and ''Yr Arwr'' as a symbol of goodness, fairness, freedom, and justice. It is wished that through his sacrifice, and his union with ''Merch y Drycinoedd'' at the end of the ode, a better age will come.

===Trawsfynydd===
A bronze statue of Hedd Wyn, dressed as a shepherd, was unveiled by his mother in the centre of the village in 1923. It bears an [[englyn]] which Hedd Wyn had written in memory of a slain friend, Tommy Morris.

Evans' bardic chair is on permanent display at his family's hill farm near Trawsfynydd. Yr Ysgwrn has been preserved just as it was in 1917 by the poet's nephew, Gerald Williams. In 2012, he was awarded an [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for his &quot;exceptional contribution&quot; to conserving the heritage of his bardic uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-20857039 |title=BBC News – Wales honours: Libyan Mahdi Jibani MBE for medical and interfaith work |publisher=BBC NEWS|date=29 December 2012|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Snowdonia National Park Authority]] announced on [[St David's Day]] 2012 that it had acquired the [[Grade II* listed buildings in Gwynedd|Grade II-listed]] farmstead for the Welsh nation. The Authority's objectives are to protect and preserve the site while enhancing the visitor experience in order to share the story of Hedd Wyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snowdonia.gov.wales/visiting/yr-ysgwrn?name=|title=Yr Ysgwrn|publisher=www.snowdonia.gov.wales|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centennial commemorations===
In August 2014, the [[Welsh Memorial Park, Ypres]] was unveiled at [[Pilckem Ridge]] near Ypres. The [[war memorial]] stands close to the spot where Hedd Wyn was mortally wounded in July 1917 during the [[Battle of Passchendaele]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagebos&quot;/&gt;

To mark the 100th anniversary of his death, a Bardic chair was made to celebrate the life of Hedd Wyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-38585595|title=New chair marks Welsh WW1 poet Hedd Wyn's centenary|publisher=BBC NEWS|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented to the [[Welsh Government]] at a special service of remembrance at Birkenhead Park in September 2017. A memorial to the poet was also unveiled in the park, the site of the 1917 National Eisteddfod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-41214767|title=Birkenhead festival marks Hedd Wyn Black Chair centenary|publisher=BBC NEWS|date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, as part of the annual [[Remembrance Day|British Armistice commemorations]], a video installation commemorating the life of Hedd Wynn was beamed onto the exterior walls of the [[National Library of Wales]], [[Aberystwyth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-41511334|title=Hedd Wyn video installation on National Library of Wales|publisher=BBC NEWS|date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was the culmination of a project involving more than 800 schoolchildren and adults at primary and secondary schools across Wales which looked at the life and legacy of the poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scottishpower.com/pages/spfnews_war_poet_hedd_wyn_remembered_in_unique_video_installation_beamed_on_to_the_national_library_of_wales.aspx|title=War poet Hedd Wyn remembered in unique video installation beamed on to the National Library of Wales|accessdate=March 3, 2019|website=www.scottishpower.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Film===
The [[anti-war film|anti-war]] [[biopic]] ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]'' was released in 1992. The film, which starred [[Huw Garmon]] as the poet, is based on a [[screenplay]] by [[Alan Llwyd]]. It depicts Hedd Wyn as a [[tragic hero]] who has an intense dislike of the wartime [[ultranationalism]] which surrounds him and his doomed struggle to avoid conscription.

In 1993 ''Hedd Wyn'' won the Royal Television Society's Television Award for Best Single Drama. It became the first British motion picture to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[66th Academy Awards]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;BFI 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The BFI: Hedd Wyn (1992)|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7c1b94fb|accessdate=5 January 2017 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|year=2017|work=British Film Institute website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, at the newly inaugurated [[BAFTA Cymru|BAFTA Cymru Awards]], it won in six categories: Best Director ([[Paul Turner (director)|Paul Turner]]), Best Design (by Jane Roberts and Martin Morley), Best Drama – Welsh (Shan Davies and Paul Turner), Best Editor (Chris Lawrence), Best Original Music ([[John E.R.

===Literature===
''The Black Chair'', a 2009 novel for young people by [[Phil Carradice]], is based on the life of Hedd Wyn.&lt;ref&gt;Carradice (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, Y Lolfa published ''An Empty Chair'', a novel for young people telling the story of Hedd Wyn as seen from the point of view of his teenage sister, Anni (mother of Gerald Williams). It is an adaptation by Haf Llewelyn of her prize-winning Welsh-language novel, ''Diffodd Y Sêr''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ylolfa.com/en/dangos.php?ISBN=9781784614522|title=''An Empty Chair: The story of Welsh First World War poet Hedd Wyn''|publisher=Y Lolfa|accessdate=29 September 2017}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
The track &quot;Halflife&quot; on the 2015 album ''Everyone Was a Bird'' by avant garde [[electronica]] group [[Grasscut]] references Hedd Wyn as a figure in the history of Trawsfynydd, merging his presence with that of the reactors of the [[Trawsfynydd nuclear power station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caughtbytheriver.net/2015/04/robert-macfarlane-landscape-grasscut/|title=Everyone Was A Bird |website=www.caughtbytheriver.net|access-date=2019-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vaudeville''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɔː|d|(|ə|)|v|ɪ|l}}; {{IPA-fr|vodvil|lang}}) is a [[theatre|theatrical]] [[genre]] of [[variety show|variety entertainment]] born in France at the end of the 19th century. A vaudeville was originally a comedy without psychological or moral intentions, based on a comical situation: a dramatic composition or light poetry, interspersed with songs or ballets. It became popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s, but the idea of vaudeville's theatre changed radically from its French antecedent.

In some ways analogous to [[music hall]] from [[Victorian Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vsforms.html |title=Forms of Variety Theater |date=1996 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a typical American vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate, unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill. Types of acts have included popular and classical [[musician]]s, singers, [[dancer]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[animal training|trained animals]], [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquists]], [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongmen]], female and male impersonators, [[acrobatics|acrobats]], [[Clown|clowns]], [[illustrated song]]s, [[Juggling|jugglers]], one-act [[Play (theatre)|plays]] or scenes from plays, [[Sportsperson|athletes]], lecturing [[celebrities]], [[Minstrel show|minstrels]], and [[film|movies]]. A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a &quot;vaudevillian&quot;.

Vaudeville developed from many sources, also including the [[concert saloon]], [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]], [[freak show]]s, [[dime museum]]s, and literary [[American burlesque]]. Called &quot;the heart of American show business&quot;, vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in [[North America]] for several decades.&lt;ref name=Trav&gt;{{cite book| last=Trav| first=S.D.| title=No Applause-Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous| date=October 31, 2006| publisher=Faber &amp; Faber| isbn=978-0-86547-958-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The origin of the [[Terminology|term]] is obscure but often explained as being derived from the French expression ''voix de ville'' (&quot;voice of the city&quot;). A second speculation is that it comes from the 15th-century songs on satire by poet [[Olivier Basselin]], &quot;Vau de Vire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenrick&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Kenrick| first=John| title=A History of The Musical: Vaudeville| url=http://www.musicals101.com/vaude1.htm| accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'' television series, science historian [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] argues that the term is a corruption of the French &quot;Vau de [[Vire (river)|Vire]]&quot; (&quot;Vire River Valley&quot;, in English), an area known for its bawdy drinking songs and where [[Olivier Basselin|Basselin]] lived;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| title=An Invisible Object| last=Burke| first=James| author-link=James Burke (science historian)| medium=[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]3 DVD| publisher=Ambrose Video Publishing, Inc.| date=September 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1610, Jean le Houx collected these works as ''{{ill|Le Livre des Chants nouveaux de Vaudevire|fr}}'', which is probably the direct origin of the word. Some, however, preferred the earlier term &quot;variety&quot; to what manager [[Tony Pastor]] called its &quot;sissy and Frenchified&quot; successor. Thus, vaudeville marketed itself as &quot;variety&quot; well into the 20th century.

With its first subtle appearances within the early 1860s, vaudeville was not initially a common form of entertainment. The form gradually evolved from the [[concert saloon]] and variety hall into its mature form throughout the 1870s and 1880s. This more gentle form was known as &quot;Polite Vaudeville&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1=Frank| last1=Cullen| first2=Florence| last2=Hackman| first3=Donald| last3=McNeilly| chapter=Vaudeville History| title=Vaudeville, Old &amp; New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America| pages=xi-xxxii| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC| location=London| publisher=Routledge| date=October 8, 2006| isbn=9780415938532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years before the [[American Civil War]], entertainment existed on a different scale. Certainly, variety theatre existed before 1860 in Europe and elsewhere. In the US, as early as the first decades of the 19th century, theatergoers could enjoy a performance consisting of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] plays, acrobatics, singing, dancing, and comedy.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} As the years progressed, people seeking diversified amusement found an increasing number of ways to be entertained. Vaudeville was characterized by traveling companies touring through cities and towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1513870/Television-in-the-United-States/283603/Variety-shows?anchor=ref1053883| title=Television in the United States| first=Robert J.| last=Thompson| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| date=February 4, 2014| accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A handful of [[Circus|circuses]] regularly toured the country; dime museums appealed to the curious; amusement parks, riverboats, and town halls often featured &quot;cleaner&quot; presentations of variety entertainment; compared to saloons, music halls, and [[American burlesque|burlesque]] houses, which catered to those with a taste for the ''risqué''. In the 1840s, the [[minstrel show]], another type of variety performance, and &quot;the first emanation of a pervasive and purely American mass culture&quot;, grew to enormous popularity and formed what [[Nick Tosches]] called &quot;the heart of 19th-century show business&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Where Dead Voices Gather |last=Tosches |first=Nick |year=2002 |publisher=Back Bay Books |location=Boston |isbn=0-316-89537-7 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant influence also came from &quot;Dutch&quot; (i.e., German or faux-German) minstrels and comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1-first=Nils| editor1-last=Grosch| editor2-first=Tobias| editor2-last=Widmaier| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObeD10YDRU0C&amp;pg=PA233| title=Lied und populäre Kultur/ Song and Popular Culture| language=German| page=233| publisher=Waxman Verlag GmbH| year=2010| location=Münster| isbn=978-3-8309-2395-4| quote= ... the widespread influence Dutch minstrels and comedians had with their musical and dramaturgical idiom on vaudeville, the circuit of traveling tent shows.&amp;nbsp;...

Vaudeville incorporated these various itinerant amusements into a stable, institutionalized form centered in America's growing urban hubs.

From the mid-1860s, [[impresario]] [[Tony Pastor]], a former singing circus clown who had become a prominent variety theater performer and manager, capitalized on [[middle class]] sensibilities and spending power when he began to feature &quot;polite&quot; variety programs in his [[New York City]] theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/vaudeville|title=vaudeville {{!}} entertainment|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastor opened his first &quot;Opera House&quot; on the [[Bowery]] in 1865, later moving his variety theater operation to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and, finally, to Fourteenth Street near [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]]. He only began to use the term &quot;vaudeville&quot; in place of &quot;variety&quot; in early 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Armond Fields, Tony Pastor, Father of Vaudeville (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Co., 2007), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to draw a potential audience from female and family-based shopping traffic [[Upper Manhattan|uptown]], Pastor barred the sale of liquor in his theatres, eliminated bawdy material from his shows, and offered gifts of coal and hams to attendees. Pastor's experiment proved successful, and other managers soon followed suit.

The manager's comments, sent back to the circuit's central office weekly, follow each act's description. The bill illustrates the typical pattern of opening the show with a &quot;dumb&quot; act to allow patrons to find their seats, placing strong acts in second and penultimate positions, and leaving the weakest act for the end, to clear the house.

As well, note that in this bill, as in many vaudeville shows, acts often associated with &quot;lowbrow&quot; or popular entertainment (acrobats, a trained mule) shared a stage with acts more usually regarded as &quot;highbrow&quot; or classical entertainment (opera vocalists, classical musicians).

[[Benjamin Franklin Keith|B. F. Keith]] took the next step, starting in [[Boston]], where he built an empire of [[theater (structure)|theatres]] and brought vaudeville to the US and Canada. Later, [[Edward Franklin Albee II|E. F. Albee]], adoptive grandfather of the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning playwright [[Edward Albee]], managed the chain to its greatest success. Circuits such as those managed by Keith-Albee provided vaudeville's greatest economic innovation and the principal source of its industrial strength. They enabled a chain of allied vaudeville houses that remedied the chaos of the single-theatre booking system by contracting acts for regional and national tours. These could easily be lengthened from a few weeks to two years.

Albee also gave national prominence to vaudeville's trumpeting &quot;polite&quot; entertainment, a commitment to entertainment equally inoffensive to men, women and children.  Acts that violated this ethos (e.g., those that used words such as &quot;hell&quot;) were admonished and threatened with expulsion from the week's remaining performances or were canceled altogether. In spite of such threats, performers routinely flouted this [[censorship]], often to the delight of the very audience members whose sensibilities were supposedly endangered. He eventually instituted a set of guidelines to be an audience member at his show, and these were reinforced by the ushers working in the theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenrick&quot; /&gt;

This &quot;polite entertainment&quot; also extended to Keith's company members. He went to extreme measures to maintain this level of modesty. Keith even went as far as posting warnings backstage such as this: &quot;Don't say 'slob' or 'son of a gun' or 'hully gee' on the stage unless you want to be canceled peremptorily... if you are guilty of uttering anything sacrilegious or even suggestive you will be immediately closed and will never again be allowed in a theatre where Mr. Keith is in authority.&quot; Along these same lines of discipline, Keith's theatre managers would occasionally send out blue envelopes with orders to omit certain suggestive lines of songs and possible substitutions for those words. If actors chose to ignore these orders or quit, they would get &quot;a black mark&quot; on their name and would never again be allowed to work on the Keith Circuit. Thus, actors learned to follow the instructions given to them by B.&amp;nbsp;F. Keith for fear of losing their careers forever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenrick&quot; /&gt;

By the late 1890s, vaudeville had large circuits, houses (small and large) in almost every sizable location, standardized booking, broad pools of skilled acts, and a loyal national following. One of the biggest circuits was Martin Beck's [[Orpheum Circuit, Inc.|Orpheum Circuit]]. It incorporated in 1919 and brought together 45 vaudeville theatres in 36 cities throughout the US and Canada and a large interest in two vaudeville circuits. Another major circuit was that of [[Alexander Pantages]]. In his heyday, Pantages owned more than 30 vaudeville theatres and controlled, through management contracts, perhaps 60 more in both the US and Canada.

At its height, vaudeville played across multiple strata of economic class and auditorium size. On the vaudeville circuit, it was said that if an act would succeed in [[Peoria, Illinois]], it would work anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luciano |first1=Phil |title='Will it play in Peoria?' still plays here and nationally |journal=Journal Star |date=27 April 2019 |url=https://www.pjstar.com/news/20190427/will-it-play-in-peoria-still-plays-here-and-nationally |accessdate=4 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters to the Editor: Playing in Peoria |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/magazine/l-playing-in-peoria-127721.html |accessdate=4 January 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=3 November 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Will It Play In Peoria?

The three most common levels were the &quot;small time&quot; (lower-paying contracts for more frequent performances in rougher, often converted theatres), the &quot;medium time&quot; (moderate wages for two performances each day in purpose-built theatres), and the &quot;big time&quot; (possible remuneration of several thousand dollars per week in large, urban theatres largely patronized by the middle and upper-middle classes).  As performers rose in renown and established regional and national followings, they worked their way into the less arduous working conditions and better pay of the big time.  The capital of the big time was New York City's [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] (or just &quot;The Palace&quot; in the slang of vaudevillians), built by [[Martin Beck (vaudeville)|Martin Beck]] in 1913 and operated by Keith.  Featuring a bill stocked with inventive novelty acts, national celebrities, and acknowledged masters of vaudeville performance (such as comedian and trick roper [[Will Rogers]]), the Palace provided what many vaudevillians considered the apotheosis of remarkable careers. A standard show bill would begin with a sketch, follow with a single (an individual male or female performer); next would be an alley-oop (an acrobatic act); then another single, followed by yet another sketch such as a blackface comedy. The acts that followed these for the rest of the show would vary from musicals to jugglers to song-and-dance singles and end with a final extravaganza – either musical or drama – with the full company. These shows would feature such stars as ragtime and jazz pianist [[Eubie Blake]], the famous and magical [[Harry Houdini]], and child star [[Baby Rose Marie]], adds Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gilbert| first=Douglas| title=American Vaudeville: Its Life and Times| url=https://archive.org/details/americanvaudevil0000gilb| url-access=registration| year=1940| publisher=Whittlesey House}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[New-York Tribune]]''{{'}}s article about Vaudeville, it is said that at any given time, Vaudeville was employing over twelve thousand different people throughout its entire industry. Each entertainer would be on the road 42 weeks at a time while working a particular &quot;Circuit&quot; – or an individual theatre chain of a major company.&lt;ref name=OldNews&gt;{{cite web| last=Webwerks| title=''The New York Tribune'': Vaudeville| url=http://www.oldnewsads.com/Vaudeville.html| publisher=Oldnewsads.com| accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the neighborhood character of vaudeville attendance had always promoted a tendency to tailor fare to specific audiences, mature vaudeville grew to feature houses and circuits specifically aimed at certain demographic groups. Black patrons, often segregated into the rear of the second gallery in white-oriented theatres, had their own smaller circuits, as did speakers of [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]].  (For a brief discussion of Black vaudeville, see [[Theatre Owners Booking Association]].)  This foreign addition combined with comedy produced such acts as &quot;minstrel shows of antebellum America&quot; and Yiddish theatre. PBS adds that many of these ethnic families joined in on this entertainment business, and for them, this traveling lifestyle was simply a continuation of the adventures that brought them to America. Through these acts, they were able to assimilate themselves into their new home while also bringing bits of their own culture into this new world.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web| title=Vaudeville: About Vaudeville| url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/vaudeville/about-vaudeville/721/| publisher=[[PBS]] [[American Masters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; White-oriented regional circuits, such as [[New England]]'s &quot;Peanut Circuit&quot;, also provided essential training grounds for new artists while allowing established acts to experiment with and polish new material.  At its height, vaudeville was rivaled only by churches and public schools among the nation's premiere public gathering places.

Another slightly different aspect of Vaudeville was an increasing interest in the female figure. The previously mentioned ominous idea of &quot;the blue envelopes&quot; led to the phrase &quot;blue&quot; material, which described the provocative subject matter present in many Vaudeville acts of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenrick&quot; /&gt; Many managers even saw this scandalous material as a marketing strategy to attract many different audiences. As stated in Andrew Erdman's book ''Blue Vaudeville'', the Vaudeville stage was &quot;a highly sexualized space&amp;nbsp;... where unclad bodies, provocative dancers, and singers of 'blue' lyrics all vied for attention.&quot; Such performances highlighted and objectified the female body as a &quot;sexual delight&quot;, a phenomenon that historians believe{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} emerged in the mid-19th century. But more than that, these historians think that Vaudeville marked a time in which the female body became its own &quot;sexual spectacle&quot; more than it ever had before. This sexual image began sprouting everywhere an American went: the shops, a restaurant, the grocery store, etc.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} The more this image brought in the highest revenue, the more Vaudeville focused on acts involving women. Even acts that were as innocent as a sister act were higher sellers than a good brother act. Consequently, Erdman adds that female Vaudeville performers such as Julie Mackey and Gibson's Bathing Girls began to focus less on talent and more on physical appeal through their figure, tight gowns, and other revealing attire. It eventually came as a surprise to audience members when such beautiful women actually possessed talent in addition to their appealing looks. This element of surprise colored much of the reaction to the female entertainment of this time.&lt;ref name=Erdman&gt;{{cite book| last=Erdman| first=Andrew L.| title=Blue Vaudeville| publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.| isbn=978-0-7864-3115-1| date=January 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women == 
In the 1920s announcements seeking all-girl bands for vaudeville performances appeared in industry publications like ''Billboard'', ''Variety'' and in newspapers. Bands like [[The Ingenues]] and [[The Dixie Sweethearts]] were well-publicized, while other groups were simply described as &quot;all-girl Revue&quot;. Similar trends in theater and film objectified images of women to allow [[male gaze]] in the gender divisions that developed as women's role in public life was expanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGee |first1=Kristin A. |title=Some Liked It Hot: Jazz Women in Film and Television, 1928-1959 |date=2009 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |isbn=978-0819569677 |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vmsbhYc8-XEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immigrant America ==
In addition to vaudeville's prominence as a form of American entertainment, it reflected the newly evolving urban inner-city culture and interaction of its operators and audience. Making up a large portion of [[immigration to the United States]] in the mid-19th century, Irish Americans interacted with established Americans, with the Irish becoming subject to discrimination due to their ethnic physical and cultural characteristics. The ethnic stereotypes of Irish through their greenhorn depiction alluded to their newly arrived status as immigrant Americans, with the stereotype portrayed in avenues of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Following the Irish immigration wave, several waves followed in which new immigrants from different backgrounds came in contact with the Irish in America's urban centers. Already settled and being native English speakers, Irish Americans took hold of these advantages and began to assert their positions in the immigrant racial hierarchy based on skin tone and assimilation status, cementing job positions that were previously unavailable to them as recently arrived immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The largest Dalmatian mountains are [[Dinara]], [[Mosor]], [[Svilaja]], [[Biokovo]], [[Moseć]], [[Veliki Kozjak]], and [[Mali Kozjak]]. The regional geographical unit of historical Dalmatia{{clarify|reason=what period (century at least) does &quot;historical Dalmatia&quot; refer to?|date=August 2012}} – the coastal region between Istria and the Gulf of Kotor – includes the [[Orjen]] mountains with the highest peak in Montenegro, 1894 m. In present-day Dalmatia, the highest peak is Dinara (1913 m), which is not a coastal mountain, while the highest coastal Dinaric mountains are on Biokovo (Sv.

[[File:REmpire Dalmatia.svg|thumb|upright=0.85|Province of Dalmatia during the Roman Empire]]
[[File:Late roman province Thracia Outcut from Roman provinces of Illyricum, Macedonia, Dacia, Moesia, Pannonia and Thracia.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Late Roman provinces]]
Dalmatia's name is derived from the name of an [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe called the [[Dalmatae]] who lived in the area of the eastern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast in the 1st millennium BC. It was part of the [[Illyria]]n Kingdom between the 4th century BC and the [[Illyrian Wars]] (220, 168 BC) when the [[Roman Republic]] established its protectorate south of the river [[Neretva]]. The name &quot;Dalmatia&quot; was in use probably from the second half of the 2nd century BC and certainly from the first half of the 1st century BC, defining a coastal area of the eastern [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]] between the [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] and [[Neretva]] rivers.&lt;ref&gt;S.Čače, ''Ime Dalmacije u 2. i 1. st. prije Krista'', Radovi Filozofskog fakulteta u Zadru, godište 40 za 2001. Zadar, 2003, pp. 29, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; It was slowly incorporated into Roman possessions until the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was formally established around 32–27 BC. In 9 AD the Dalmatians raised the last in [[Bellum Batonianum|a series of revolts]]&lt;ref&gt;Charles George Herbermann, ''The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference'' (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; together with the Pannonians, but it was finally crushed and, in 10 AD, Illyricum was split into two provinces, [[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], which spread into larger area inland to cover all of the [[Dinaric Alps]] and most of the eastern Adriatic coast.&lt;ref&gt;M.Zaninović, ''Ilirsko pleme Delmati'', pp. 58, 83-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Theodore Mommsen]] wrote in his book, ''The Provinces of the Roman Empire'', that all Dalmatia was fully romanized by the 4th century AD. However, analysis of archaeological material from that period has shown that the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] was rather selective. While urban centers, both coastal and inland, were almost completely romanized, the situation in the countryside was completely different. Despite the Illyrians being subject to a strong process of acculturation, they continued to speak their native language, worship their own gods and traditions, and follow their own social-political tribal organization which was adapted to Roman administration and political structure only in some necessities.&lt;ref&gt;A. Stipčević'', Iliri'', Školska knjiga Zagreb, 1974, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], with the beginning of the [[Migration Period]], left the region subject to [[Goths|Gothic]] rulers [[Odoacer]] and [[Theodoric the Great]]. They ruled Dalmatia from 480 to 535 AD, when it was restored to the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern (Byzantine) Empire]] by [[Justinian I]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

{{See also|Dalmatia (theme)|Dalmatian city-states|Dalmatian Croatia|Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Medieval Dalmatian principalities}}
The Middle Ages in Dalmatia were a period of intense rivalry among neighboring powers: the waning [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]] (later in a [[Croatia in union with Hungary|personal union with Hungary]]), the [[Bosnian Kingdom]], and the [[Venetian Republic]]. Dalmatia at the time consisted of the [[Dalmatian city-states|coastal cities functioning much like city-states]], with extensive autonomy, but in mutual conflict and without control of the rural hinterland (the [[Zagora (Croatia)|Zagora]]). Ethnically, Dalmatia started out as a Roman region, with a romance culture that began to develop independently, forming the now-extinct [[Dalmatian language]].

In the [[Early Middle ages|Early Medieval period]], Byzantine Dalmatia was ravaged by an [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] invasion that destroyed its capital, [[Salona]], in 639 AD, an event that allowed for the settlement of the nearby [[Diocletian's Palace]] in [[Spalatum]] (Split) by Salonitans, greatly increasing the importance of the city. The Avars were followed by the great [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] migrations.&lt;ref&gt;Curta Florin. ''Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, 2006; {{ISBN|978-0-521-81539-0}} ([https://books.google.com/?id=YIAYMNOOe0YC&amp;pg=RA2-PA100&amp;lpg=RA2-PA100&amp;dq=qytet+fort+city#v=onepage&amp;q=qytet%20fort%20city&amp;f=false])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slavs, loosely allied with the Avars, permanently settled the region in the first half of the 7th century AD and remained its predominant ethnic group ever since. The Croats soon formed their own realm: the Principality of [[Dalmatian Croatia]] ruled by native Princes of [[Guduscani|Guduscan]] origin. Dalmatia was part of Dukla in the period until the 11th century, rulled by the Serbian royal family Vlastimirovic.[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duklja] The meaning of the geographical term &quot;Dalmatia&quot; now shrank to the coastal cities and their immediate hinterland. These cities were the romance-speaking Dalmatian city-states and remained influential as they were well fortified and maintained their connection with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The original name of the cities was ''Jadera, Spalatum, Crespa, Arba, Tragurium, Vecla, Ragusium'' and ''Cattarum''. The language and the laws were initially [[Latin]], but after a few centuries they developed their own neo-Latin language (the &quot;[[Dalmatian language|Dalmatico]]&quot;), that lasted until the 19th century. The cities were maritime centres with a huge commerce mainly with the Italian peninsula and with the growing [[Republic of Venice]]. The two communities were somewhat hostile at first, but as the Croats became [[Christianization|Christianized]] this tension increasingly subsided. A degree of cultural mingling soon took place, in some enclaves stronger, in others weaker, as Slavic influence and culture was more accentuated in Ragusa, Spalatum, and Tragurium.

In about 925 AD, [[Tomislav of Croatia|Duke Tomislav]] was crowned, establishing the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]], and extending his influence further southwards to [[Zahumlje|Zachlumia]]. As an ally of the Byzantine Empire, the King was given the status of Protector of Dalmatia, and became its ''de facto'' ruler.

During the rain of Prince [[Časlav]] Vlastimitovic, Dalmatia fell under the protectorate of the Byzantine empire. Chaslav enlarged Serbia, uniting the tribes of Bosnia, Herzegovina, Old Serbia and Montenegro (incorporating Zeta, Pagania, Zahumlje, Travunia,[6] Konavle, Bosnia and Rascia into Serbia, &quot;ι Σερβλια&quot;). He took over regions previously held by Michael of Zahumlje, who disappeared from the sources in 925.[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Caslav]

[[File:SPLIT-Adam S front view.jpg|thumb|left|An engraving of the seaward walls of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] by [[Robert Adam]], 1764. The walls were originally built for the Roman [[Diocletian's Palace]].]]
In the [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval period]], the Byzantine Empire was no longer able to maintain its power consistently in Dalmatia, and was finally rendered impotent so far west by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. The Venetian Republic, on the other hand, was in the ascendant, while the Kingdom of Croatia became increasingly influenced by Hungary to the north, being absorbed into it via personal union in 1102. Thus, these two factions became involved in a struggle in this area, intermittently controlling it as the balance shifted. During the reign of King [[Emeric, King of Hungary#Wars in the Balkans (1200–1203)|Emeric]], the Dalmatian cities separated from Hungary by a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;cit: ''Hunc iste, postquam Dalmatae pacto hoc a Hungaria separati se non tulissent, revocatum contra Emericum armis vindicavit, ac [[Livno#History|Chelmensi Ducatu]], ad mare sito, parteque [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedoniae]] auxit.'' AD 1199. Luc. lib. IV. cap. III. Diplomata [[Béla IV of Hungary|Belae IV]]. AD 1269.&lt;/ref&gt; A consistent period of Hungarian rule in Dalmatia was ended with the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]] of Hungary in 1241. The [[Mongols]] severely impaired the feudal state, so much so that that same year, King [[Béla IV of Hungary|Béla IV]] had to take refuge in Dalmatia, as far south as the [[Klis]] fortress. The Mongols attacked the Dalmatian cities for the next few years but eventually withdrew without major success.

In the south, due to its protected location, Kotor became a major city for the salt trade. The area was prosperous during the 14th century under the rule of Serbian emperor [[Stefan Dušan]], who encouraged law enforcement, which helped the Bay of Kotor to become a safe place for doing business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q4y0CwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Du%C5%A1an#v=snippet&amp;q=Du%C5%A1an&amp;f=false Rick Steves Snapshot Dubrovnik] by Rick Steves and Cameron Hewitt&lt;/ref&gt; In 1389 [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]], the founder of the [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (958–1463)|Bosnian Kingdom]], was able to control the Adriatic littoral between [[Kotor]] and [[Šibenik]], and even claimed control over the northern coast up to [[Rijeka]], and his own independent ally, Dubrovnik (Ragusa). This was only temporary, as Hungary and the Venetians continued their struggle over Dalmatia after Tvrtko's death in 1391. By this time, the whole Hungarian and Croatian Kingdom was facing increasing internal difficulties, as a 20-year civil war ensued between the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] from the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]]. During the war, the losing contender, [[Ladislaus of Naples]], sold his &quot;rights&quot; on Dalmatia to the Venetian Republic for a mere 100,000 [[ducat]]s. The much more centralized Republic came to control all of Dalmatia by the year 1420, it was to remain under Venetian rule for 377 years (1420–1797).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_1bA7hj3lcC&amp;q=dalmatia|title=Yugoslavia - Carol Greene - Google Livres|access-date=28 May 2014|isbn=9780516027913|year=1984|last1=Greene|first1=Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1420 to 1797 the Republic of Venice controlled most of Dalmatia, calling it ''Esclavonia'' in the 15th century&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Esclavonia, formerly called Dalmatia&quot;, according to the Spanish traveler [[Pedro Tafur]], who sailed down the coast in 1436 (Pedro Tafur, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch5 Andanças e viajes]'').&lt;/ref&gt; with the southern [[enclave]], the [[Bay of Kotor]], being called ''[[Albania Veneta]]''. [[Venetian language|Venetian]] was the commercial ''[[lingua franca]]'' in the Mediterranean at that time, and it heavily influenced Dalmatian and to a lesser degree coastal Croatian and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].

The southern city of Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]) became de facto independent in 1358 through the [[Treaty of Zadar]] when Venice relinquished its suzerainty over it to [[Louis I of Hungary]]. In 1481, Ragusa switched allegiance to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This gave its tradesmen advantages such as access to the Black Sea, and the [[Republic of Ragusa]] was the fiercest competitor to Venice's merchants in the 15th and 16th centuries.

[[File:Bosnia Eyalet, Central europe 1683.png|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Bosnia Eyalet|Ottoman Bosnia]] at its peak territorial extent just before the [[Morean War]] in 1684]]
The Republic of Venice was also one of the powers most hostile to [[Ottoman Empire#Growth (1453–1683)|the Ottoman Empire's expansion]], and participated in [[Ottoman wars in Europe|many wars against it]]. As the Ottomans took control of the hinterland, many Christians took refuge in the coastal cities of Dalmatia. The border between the Dalmatian hinterland and the [[Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina]] greatly fluctuated until the [[Morean War]], when the Venetian capture of Knin and Sinj set much of the borderline at its current position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nazor-2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=45078|language=hr|title=Inhabitants of Poljica in the War of Morea (1684-1699)|journal=Povijesni Prilozi|first=Ante|last=Nazor|volume=21|number=21|date=February 2002|publisher=Croatian Institute of History|issn=0351-9767|access-date=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Republic of Venice 1796.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Dalmatian possessions of the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1797]]
After the [[Great Turkish War]] and the [[Peace of Passarowitz]], more peaceful times made Dalmatia experience a period of certain economic and cultural growth in the 18th century, with the re-establishment of trade and exchange with the hinterland. This period was abruptly interrupted with the [[fall of the Republic of Venice]] in 1797. [[Napoleon]]'s troops stormed the region and ended the independence of the Republic of Ragusa as well, saving it from occupation by the [[Russian Empire]] and Montenegro.

In 1805, Napoleon created his [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] around the Adriatic Sea, annexing to it the former Venetian Dalmatia from Istria to Kotor. In 1808 he annexed to this Italian Kingdom the just conquered [[Republic of Ragusa]]. A year later in 1809 he removed the Venetian Dalmatia from his Kingdom of Italy and created the [[Illyrian Provinces]], which were annexed to France, and created his marshal [[Nicolas Soult]] ''Duke of Dalmatia''.

Napoleon's rule in Dalmatia was marked with war and high taxation, which caused several rebellions. On the other hand, French rule greatly contributed to [[Illyrian movement|Croatian national awakening]] (the first newspaper in Croatian was published then in Zadar, the ''[[Il Regio Dalmata – Kraglski Dalmatin]]''), the legal system and infrastructure were finally modernized somewhat in Dalmatia, and the educational system flourished. French rule brought a lot of improvements in infrastructure; many roads were built or reconstructed. Napoleon himself blamed Marshal [[Auguste Marmont]], the governor of Dalmatia, that too much money was spent. However, in 1813, the Habsburgs once again declared war on France and, by the following year, had restored control over Dalmatia.

===Nineteenth century===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}

At the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, Dalmatia was granted as a province to the Emperor of Austria. It was officially known as the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]].

Dalmatia is the area detailed in the smaller map annexed map on the right.]]
In 1848, the Croatian Assembly (Sabor) published the People's Requests, in which they requested among other things the abolition of [[serfdom]] and the unification of Dalmatia and Croatia. The Dubrovnik Municipality was the most outspoken of all the Dalmatian communes in its support for unification with Croatia. A letter was sent from Dubrovnik to Zagreb with pledges to work for this idea. In 1849, Dubrovnik continued to lead the Dalmatian cities in the struggle for unification. A large-scale campaign was launched in the Dubrovnik paper ''L'Avvenire'' (''The Future'') based on a clearly formulated programme: the federal system for the Habsburg territories, the inclusion of Dalmatia into Croatia and the Slavic brotherhood. The president of the council of Kingdom of Dalmatia was the politician Baron Vlaho Getaldić.

In the same year, the first issue of the Dubrovnik almanac appeared, ''Flower of the National Literature'' (''Dubrovnik, cvijet narodnog književstva''), in which [[Petar Preradović]] published his noted poem &quot;To Dubrovnik&quot;. This and other literary and journalistic texts, which continued to be published, contributed to the awakening of the national consciousness reflected in efforts to introduce the Croatian language into schools and offices, and to promote Croatian books. The Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] brought the so-called Imposed Constitution which prohibited the unification of Dalmatia and Croatia and also any further political activity with this end in view. The political struggle of Dubrovnik to be united with Croatia, which was intense throughout 1848–49, did not succeed at that time.

In 1861 was the meeting of the first Dalmatian Assembly, with representatives from Dubrovnik. Representatives of Kotor came to Dubrovnik to join the struggle for unification with Croatia. The citizens of Dubrovnik gave them a festive welcome, flying Croatian flags from the ramparts and exhibiting the slogan: Ragusa with Kotor. The Kotorans elected a delegation to go to Vienna; Dubrovnik nominated Niko Pucić, who went to Vienna to demand not only the unification of Dalmatia with Croatia, but also the unification of all Croatian territories under one common Assembly. During this period, the Habsburgs carried out an aggressive anti-Italian policy through a forced slavization of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= La campagna del 1866 nei documenti militari austriaci: operazioni terrestri|publisher= Padova, Antoniana |author= Angelo Filippuzzi|page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2020}}

In 1905 a dispute arose in the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Austrian Reichsrat]] over whether Austria should pay for Dalmatia. It has been argued that in the conclusion of the so-called &quot;''[[April Laws]]''&quot; is written &quot;''given by Banus Count [[Keglević|Keglevich of Buzin]]''&quot;, which explained the historical affiliation of Dalmatia to Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Stenographische Protokolle über die Sitzungen des Hauses der Abgeordneten des österreichischen Reichsrates, Ausgaben 318-329, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=R2vYT6XNK8vP4QTwtdilAw&amp;hl=de&amp;id=AlAyAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Keglevich Seite 29187], Austria, Reichsrat, Abgeordnetenhaus, published 1905.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later Dalmatia elected representatives to the Austrian Reichsrat.

Dalmatia was a strategic region during [[World War I]] that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy joined the [[Triple Entente]] [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1915 upon agreeing to the [[London Pact]] that guaranteed Italy the right to annex a large portion of Dalmatia in exchange for Italy's participation on the Allied side. From 5–6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], [[Lastovo|Lagosta]], [[Šibenik|Sebenico]], and other localities on the Dalmatian coast.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Praga, Franco Luxardo. ''History of Dalmatia''. Giardini, 1993. Pp. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Italian military had seized control of the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact and by 17 November had seized [[Rijeka]] as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul O 2005.

Pp. 17&quot;/&gt; Famous [[Italian nationalism|Italian nationalist]] [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] supported the seizure of Dalmatia, and proceeded to Zadar in an Italian warship in December 1918.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rossi. ''The Rise of Italian Fascism: 1918-1922''. New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2010. Pp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of the guarantees of the London Pact to Italy of a large portion of Dalmatia and Italian military occupation of claimed territories of Dalmatia, during the peace settlement negotiations of 1919 to 1920 the [[Fourteen Points]] of [[Woodrow Wilson]] that advocated self-determination of nations took precedence, with Italy only being permitted to annex Zadar from Dalmatia, while the rest of Dalmatia was to be part of [[Yugoslavia]].

At the end of the First World War, the Austrian Empire disintegrated, and Dalmatia was again split between the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) which controlled most of it, and the Kingdom of [[Italy]] which held small portions of northern Dalmatia around Zadar and the islands of [[Cres]], [[Lošinj]], and Lastovo. Italy entered the First World War in a territorial gamble, mostly to gain Dalmatia. But Italy got only a small part of its pretensions, so Dalmatia mostly stayed Yugoslav until [[Benito Mussolini]] invaded Yugoslavia in 1941 and [[Governorate of Dalmatia|occupied the region]].

In 1922, the territory of the former Kingdom of Dalmatia was divided into two provinces, the District of Split (''Splitska oblast''), with its capital in Split, and the District of Dubrovnik (''Dubrovačka oblast''), with its capital in [[Dubrovnik]]. In 1929, the [[Littoral Banovina]] (''Primorska Banovina''), a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, was formed. Its capital was Split, and it included most of Dalmatia and parts of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. The southern parts of Dalmatia were in [[Zeta Banovina]], from the Gulf of Kotor to [[Pelješac]] peninsula including Dubrovnik. In 1939, Littoral Banovina was joined with [[Sava Banovina]] (and with smaller parts of other banovinas) to form a new province named the [[Banovina of Croatia]]. The same year, the ethnic Croatian areas of the Zeta Banovina from the Gulf of Kotor to Pelješac, including Dubrovnik, were merged with a new Banovina of Croatia.

During World War II, in 1941, [[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], [[Hungary]], and [[Bulgaria]] occupied Yugoslavia, redrawing their borders to include former parts of the Yugoslavian state. A new Nazi puppet state, the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), was created, and Fascist Italy was given some parts of the Dalmatian coast, notably around Zadar and Split, as well as many of the area's islands. The remaining parts of Dalmatia became part of the NDH. Many Croats moved from the Italian-occupied area and took refuge in the satellite state of Croatia, which became the battleground for a guerrilla war between the [[Axis forces|Axis]] and the [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. Following the surrender of Italy in 1943, most of Italian-controlled Dalmatia was taken over by German forces and reverted to control under the puppet Independent State of Croatia. [[Zadar]] was razed by the Allies during World War II, starting the [[Istrian-Dalmatian exodus|exodus]] of its Italian population. After WWII, Dalmatia became part of the [[People's Republic of Croatia]], part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] (then called the Federative People's Republic of Yugoslavia).

The territory of former Kingdom of Dalmatia was divided between two [[Federal republic|federal]] Republics of Yugoslavia and most of the territory went to Croatia, leaving only the Bay of Kotor to [[Montenegro]]. When Yugoslavia dissolved in 1991, those borders were retained and remain in force. During the [[Croatian War of Independence|Croatian war of Independence]], most of Dalmatia was a battleground between the Croatian government and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]], which aided the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|local Serb rebels]], with much of the northern part of the region around [[Knin]] and the far South around, but not including, [[Dubrovnik]] being placed under the control of Serb forces. Croatia did regain the southern territories in 1992 but did not regain the north [[Operation Storm|until 1995]].

The network had approximately 2.4 million [[concurrent user]]s in 2003. It is estimated that the total number of users was greater than that of [[Napster]] at its peak. {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

==History==
The FastTrack protocol and Kazaa were created and developed by [[Estonia]]n programmers of BlueMoon Interactive headed by [[Jaan Tallinn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.starmus.com/team/jaan-tallinn/|title=Jaan Tallinn « STARMUS Festival|language=en|access-date=2019-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same team that later created [[Skype]]. After selling it to [[Niklas Zennström]] from [[Sweden]] and [[Janus Friis]] from [[Denmark]], it was introduced in March 2001 by their [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company Consumer Empowerment. It appeared during the end of the first generation of [[Peer-to-peer|P2P networks]] &amp;ndash; [[Napster]] shut down in July of that year. There are three FastTrack-based networks, and they use mutually [[Software incompatibility|incompatible]] versions of the protocol. The most popular [[Client (Computing)|clients]] on each are Kazaa (and its variations), Grokster, and iMesh. For more information about the various [[lawsuit]]s surrounding Kazaa and [[Sharman Networks]], see [[Kazaa]].

==Technology==
FastTrack uses [[supernode (networking)|supernode]]s to improve [[scalability]].

To allow downloading from multiple sources, FastTrack employs the [[UUHash]] [[hashing algorithm]]. While UUHash allows very large [[computer file|files]] to be [[checksum]]med in a short time, even on slow weak [[computer]]s, it also allows for massive [[data corruption|corruption]] of a file to go unnoticed. Many people, as well as the [[RIAA]], have exploited this [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] to spread corrupt and fake files on the network.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mennecke.
[http://www.slyck.com/story1019.html How Overpeer was able to corrupt data on the FastTrack network] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926232223/http://www.slyck.com/story1019.html |date=2007-09-26 }}.
2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FastTrack protocol uses [[encryption]] and was not [[documentations|documented]] by its creators. The first clients were all [[Proprietary software|closed source software]]. However, initialization data for the encryption algorithms is sent in the clear and no [[public key]] encryption is used, so [[reverse engineering]] was made comparatively easy. In 2003, [[open source]] [[programmer]]s succeeded in reverse-engineering the portion of the protocol dealing with client-[[Supernode (networking)|supernode]] communication, but the supernode-supernode communication protocol remains largely unknown. {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

==Clients==
The following programs are or have been FastTrack clients:
* '''[[Kazaa]]''' and variants
* '''[[KCeasy]]''' (requires the gIFT-fasttrack plugin)
* '''[[Grokster]]'''
* '''[[iMesh]]'''
* '''[[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]]''', until 2002

{{Redirect|MBA||MBA (disambiguation)}}
The '''Master of Business Administration''' ('''MBA''';  also '''Master's in Business Administration''') degree originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies sought [[scientific management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: A school is &quot;a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside&quot;: Toward the reinvention of the business school | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 | journal=Business Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of [[business administration]] such as [[accounting]], [[applied statistics]], [[human resources]], [[business communication]], [[business ethics]], [[business law]], [[Strategy|business strategy]], [[finance]], [[managerial economics]], [[management]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[marketing]], [[supply-chain management]], and [[operations management]] in a manner most relevant to management [[analysis]] and strategy.

Most programs also include [[elective course]]s and concentrations for further study in a particular area, for example, accounting, finance, and marketing. MBA programs in the United States typically require completing about forty to sixty [[Course credit|credits]] (sixty to ninety in a [[Academic quarter (year division)|quarter system]]), much higher than the thirty credits (thirty-six to forty-five in a quarter system) typically required for degrees that cover some of the same material such as the [[Master of Economics]], [[Master of Finance]], [[Master of Accountancy]], [[Master of Science in Marketing]] and [[Master of Science in Management]].

The MBA is a [[terminal degree]] and a [[Professional school|professional degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/getting-your-masters-degree.aspx |title=Getting Your Master's Degree |publisher=Peterson's |date=6 December 2013 |access-date=6 October 2014 |quote=A master's degree comes in only two options: a professional, or &quot;terminal&quot; master's degree or an academic master's degree, or an academic master's degree.&amp;nbsp;... A terminal degree is a means to an end; it will prepare you for entrance into a specific type or group of jobs. A terminal degree implies there is no need for any further education, thus the word &quot;terminal.&quot; Degrees from professional master's programs are usually marked by specific initials that denote their area of specialties, such as a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A) {{sic}} or Master of Library Science (M.L.S.) degree.&amp;nbsp;... Conversely, an academic degree centers on research and scholarly studies in a specific area. These degrees are more likely to lead to continued education at the doctoral level where you can specialize in a very specific area of that field&amp;nbsp;... |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010113105/http://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/getting-your-masters-degree.aspx |archive-date=10 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Maier| first = Christopher| title = Complete Book of Graduate Programs in the Arts and Sciences| url = https://archive.org/details/completebookofgr00prin| url-access = registration| publisher = Random House| location = New York| date = 2005| page = [https://archive.org/details/completebookofgr00prin/page/4 4]| isbn = 0-375-76432-1|quote=&quot;PhD&quot; and &quot;terminal degree&quot; are not synonymous.  A number of master's degrees lead students directly to, well, the end of the formal educational line.  One such example is the MFA, which is earned by practicing artists in fields such as creative writing, visual arts, and theater.  In the world of business administration degrees, an MBA is terminal.  Although a little research might turn up a handful of Ph.D. options in the creative arts or business, these are different monsters; they don't take away from the fact the person with the MFA or the MBA has a terminal degree.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[School accreditation|Accreditation]] bodies specifically for MBA programs ensure consistency and quality of education. Business schools in many countries offer programs tailored to full-time, part-time, [[corporate title|executive]] (abridged coursework typically occurring on nights or weekends) and [[distance learning]] students, many with specialized concentrations.

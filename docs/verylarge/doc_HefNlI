After years of litigation, ''[[Basic Instinct 2]]'' was released on March 31, 2006. A reason for a long delay in releasing the film was reportedly Stone's dispute with the filmmakers over the nudity in the film; she wanted more while they wanted less. A [[group sex]] scene was cut in order to achieve an R rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] for the North American release; the controversial scene remained in the UK version of the London-based film. Stone told an interviewer, &quot;We are in a time of odd repression and if a popcorn movie allows us to create a platform for discussion, wouldn't that be great?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428042109/http://www.insideeonline.com/news/details/20060315-57/sharon_stone_sought_%22brazen%22_nude_scenes.html|title=Sharon Stone sought 'brazen' nude scenes|work=Inside Entertainment|date=March 2006|archive-date=April 28, 2006|access-date=August 19, 2011|url=http://www.insideeonline.com/news/details/20060315-57/sharon_stone_sought_%22brazen%22_nude_scenes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an estimated budget of US$70 million, it placed only 10th in gross on its opening weekend with a meager US$3.2 million and was subsequently declared a flop.

Following ''Basic Instinct'', photographer [[George Hurrell]] took a series of photographs of Stone, [[Sherilyn Fenn]], [[Julian Sands]], [[Raquel Welch]], [[Eric Roberts]], and [[Sean Penn]].

===Criticism===

====Tanzania====
On January 28, 2005, Stone helped solicit pledges for $1&amp;nbsp;million in five minutes for mosquito nets in [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sharon Stone raises $1 mil. for Tanzania in 5 minutes&quot;, ''Yomiuri Shimbun'', January 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; turning a panel on [[Poverty in Africa|African poverty]] into an impromptu [[fundraising|fundraiser]] at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], Switzerland. Many observers, including [[UNICEF]], criticized her actions by claiming that Stone had reacted instinctively to the words of Tanzanian President [[Benjamin Mkapa]], because she had not done her research on the causes, consequences, and methods of preventing [[malaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;economist.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4127278|title=The $25&amp;nbsp;billion question|work=The Economist|date=June 30, 2005|access-date=August 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401132854/http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4127278|archive-date=April 1, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the $1&amp;nbsp;million pledged, only $250,000 was actually raised.

====Chinese earthquake====

Stone was criticized over her comments in an exchange on the red carpet with Hong Kong's ''[[Hong Kong Cable Television|Cable Entertainment News]]'' during the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 25, 2008. When asked about the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]] she remarked:

{{cquote|Well you know it was very interesting because at first, you know, I'm not happy about the way the Chinese are treating the [[Tibet]]ans because I don't think anyone should be unkind to anyone else.

And I had been this, you know, concerned about, oh how should we deal with the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] because they are not being nice to the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], who is a good friend of mine.

'''Rutile''' is a [[mineral]] composed primarily of [[titanium dioxide]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and is the most common natural form of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Other rarer [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are known, including [[anatase]], [[akaogiite]], and [[brookite]].

Rutile has one of the highest [[refractive index|refractive indices]] at [[visible wavelength]]s of any known crystal and also exhibits a particularly large [[birefringence]] and high [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]. Owing to these properties, it is useful for the manufacture of certain optical elements, especially [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] optics, for longer visible and [[infrared]] wavelengths up to about 4.5 μm.

Natural rutile may contain up to 10% [[iron]] and significant amounts of [[niobium]] and [[tantalum]]. Rutile derives its name from the [[Latin]] ''rutilus'', red, in reference to the deep red color observed in some specimens when viewed by transmitted light. Rutile was   first described  in 1803 by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]].

==Occurrence==
[[Image:2005rutile.PNG|thumb|left|Rutile output in 2005]]
Rutile is a common accessory mineral in high-temperature and high-pressure [[metamorphic rock]]s and in [[igneous rock]]s.

[[Thermodynamic]]ally, rutile is the most stable [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]] of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at all temperatures, exhibiting lower total [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] than [[metastable]] phases of anatase or brookite.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the transformation of the metastable TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; polymorphs to rutile is irreversible. As it has the lowest [[Van der Waals surface|molecular volume]] of the three main polymorphs, it is generally the primary titanium bearing phase in most high-pressure metamorphic rocks, chiefly [[eclogite]]s.

[[File:Rutile@quartz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rutilated quartz|Rutile in quartz]]]]
Within the igneous environment, rutile is a common accessory mineral in [[pluton]]ic igneous rocks, though it is also found occasionally in extrusive igneous rocks, particularly those such as [[kimberlite]]s and [[lamproite]]s that have deep mantle sources. Anatase and brookite are found in the igneous environment particularly as products of [[autogenic alteration]] during the cooling of plutonic rocks; anatase is also found in [[placer deposit]]s sourced from primary rutile.

The occurrence of large specimen crystals is most common in [[pegmatite]]s, [[skarn]]s, and [[granite]] [[greisen]]s. Rutile is found as an accessory mineral in some [[metasomatism|altered igneous rocks]], and in certain [[gneiss]]es and [[schist]]s. In groups of acicular [[crystal]]s it is frequently seen penetrating [[quartz]] as in the ''fléches d'amour'' from [[Graubünden]], [[Switzerland]]. In 2005 the Republic of [[Sierra Leone]] in [[West Africa]] had a production capacity of 23% of the world's annual rutile supply, which rose to approximately 30% in 2008.

The oxygen anions have a coordination number of 3, resulting in a trigonal planar coordination. Rutile also shows a screw axis when its octahedra are viewed sequentially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/Petrology/Rutile%20Structure.HTM &quot;Rutile Structure&quot;], Steven Dutch, Natural and Applied Sciences, University of Wisconsin&amp;nbsp;– Green Bay.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutile crystals are most commonly observed to exhibit a prismatic or acicular [[Crystal habit|growth habit]] with preferential orientation along their ''c'' axis, the [001] [[Miller index|direction]]. This growth habit is favored as the {110} facets of rutile exhibit the lowest [[Surface energy|surface free energy]] and are therefore thermodynamically most stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Journal of Crystal Growth| volume=359|pages= 83–91|year=2012|title=Abnormal grain growth of rutile TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induced by ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|doi=10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2012.08.015|arxiv=1303.2761|bibcode=2012JCrGr.359...83H| last1=Hanaor| first1=Dorian A.H.| last2=Xu| first2=Wanqiang| last3=Ferry| first3=Michael| last4=Sorrell| first4=Charles C.| last5=Sorrell| first5=Charles C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''c''-axis oriented growth of rutile appears clearly in [[nanorods]], [[nanowires]] and [[abnormal grain growth]] phenomena of this phase.

==Uses and economic importance==
[[File:Rutile needles.jpg|thumb|Acicular crystals of rutile protruding from a [[quartz]] crystal]]
In large enough quantities in [[beach]] [[sand]]s, rutile forms an important constituent of [[heavy mineral]]s and [[ore]] deposits. Miners extract and separate the valuable [[mineral]]s&amp;nbsp;– e.g.,&amp;nbsp;rutile, [[zircon]], and [[ilmenite]]. The main uses for rutile are the manufacture of [[refractory]] [[ceramic]], as a [[pigment]], and for the production of [[titanium]] metal.

Finely powdered rutile is a brilliant white pigment and is used in [[paint]]s, [[plastic]]s, [[paper]], foods, and other applications that call for a bright white color. [[Titanium dioxide]] pigment is the single greatest use of titanium worldwide. Nanoscale particles of rutile are transparent to [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] but are highly effective in the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[ultraviolet]] radiation. The UV absorption of nano-sized rutile particles is blue-shifted compared to bulk rutile, so that higher-energy UV light is absorbed by the [[nanoparticle]]s. Hence, they are used in [[sunscreen]]s to protect against UV-induced skin damage.

Small rutile needles present in [[gemstone|gems]] are responsible for an [[optical phenomenon]] known as [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]]. Asteriated gems are known as &quot;star&quot; gems. Star [[sapphire]]s, star [[ruby|rubies]], and other &quot;star&quot; gems are highly sought after and are generally more valuable than their normal counterparts.

Rutile is widely used as a [[Shielded metal arc welding|welding]] electrode covering. It is also used as a part of the [[ZTR index]], which classifies highly [[Weathering|weathered]] sediments.

Rutile, as a large band-gap [[semiconductor]], has in recent decades been the subject of significant research towards applications as a functional oxide for applications in [[photocatalysis]] and [[Magnetic semiconductor|dilute magnetism]].&lt;ref&gt; [https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1854 Magnetism in titanium dioxide polymorphs] J. Applied Physics &lt;/ref&gt; Research efforts typically utilize small quantities of synthetic rutile rather than mineral-deposit derived materials.

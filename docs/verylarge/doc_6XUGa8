== Early life ==
Rudolf was born on 1 May 1218 at Limburgh Castle near [[Sasbach am Kaiserstuhl]] in the [[Breisgau]] region of present-day southwestern [[Germany]].{{sfn|Coxe|1847|p=5}} He was the son of Count [[Albert IV, Count of Habsburg|Albert IV of Habsburg]] and of Hedwig, daughter of Count Ulrich of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]].{{sfn|Emerton|1917|p=76}} Around 1232, he was given as a squire to his uncle, [[Rudolf I, Count of Laufenburg]], to train in knightly pursuits.

== Count of Habsburg ==

At his father's death in 1239, Rudolf inherited from him large estates  around the ancestral seat of [[Habsburg Castle]] in the [[Aargau]] region of present-day [[Switzerland]] as well as in [[Alsace]]. Thus, in 1240&lt;ref name=EnBr&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. '''26'''. 1911, pp. 247&lt;/ref&gt; in order to quell the rising power of Rudolf and in an attempt to place the important &quot;[[Devil’s Bridge]]&quot; (''{{lang|de|Teufelsbrücke}}'') across the ''{{lang|de|Schöllenenschlucht}}'' under his direct control, Emperor Frederick II, granted [[Schwyz]] ''[[Reichsfreiheit]]'' in the ''Freibrief von Faenza''.

In 1242, [[Hugh of Tuffenstein]] provoked Count Rudolf through contumelious expressions.{{clarify|date=October 2016}} In turn, the Count of Habsburg had invaded his domains, yet failed to take his seat of power. As the day passed on,{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Count Rudolf bribed the sentinels of the city and gained entry, killing Hugh in the process. Then in 1244, to help control [[Lake Lucerne]] and restrict the neighboring forest communities of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], Schwyz and [[Unterwalden]], Rudolf built near its shores [[Neuhabsburg Castle]].&lt;ref name=EnBr/&gt; In 1245 Rudolf married Gertrude, daughter of Count Burkhard III of [[Counts of Hohenberg (Swabia)|Hohenberg]]. He received as her dowry the castles of [[Oettingen]], the valley of [[Weile]], and other places in Alsace, and he became an important vassal in Swabia, the former [[Alamanni|Alemannic]] German [[stem duchy]]. That same year, Emperor Frederick II was excommunicated by [[Pope Innocent IV]] at the [[First Council of Lyon|Council of Lyon]]. Rudolf sided against the Emperor, while the forest communities sided with Frederick. This gave them a pretext to attack and damage Neuhabsburg. Rudolf successfully defended it and drove them off. As a result, Rudolf, by siding with the Pope, gained more power and influence.&lt;ref name=EnBr/&gt;

Rudolf paid frequent visits to the court of his godfather, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], and his loyalty to Frederick and his son, King [[Conrad IV of Germany]], was richly rewarded by grants of land. In 1254, he engaged with other nobles of the Staufen party against [[Bertold II, Bishop of Basle]]. When night fell, he penetrated the suburbs of Basle and burnt down the local nunnery, an act for which [[Pope Innocent IV]] excommunicated him and all parties involved. As a penance, he took up the cross and joined [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II, King of Bohemia]] in the [[Prussian Crusade#Samland|Prussian Crusade of 1254]]. Whilst there, he oversaw the founding of the city of [[Königsberg]], which was named in memory of King Ottokar.

== Rise to power ==
The disorder in Germany during the [[interregnum]] after the fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty afforded an opportunity for Count Rudolf to increase his possessions. His wife was a Hohenberg heiress; and on the death of his childless maternal uncle Count Hartmann IV of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] in 1264, Rudolf seized Hartmann's valuable estates. Successful feuds with the [[Bishopric of Strasbourg|Bishops of Strasbourg]] and [[Bishopric of Basel|Basel]] further augmented his wealth and reputation, including rights over various tracts of land that he purchased from [[abbot]]s and others.

These various sources of wealth and influence rendered Rudolf the most powerful prince and noble in southwestern Germany (where the tribal [[Duchy of Swabia]] had disintegrated, enabling its vassals to become completely independent). In the autumn of 1273, the [[prince-elector]]s met to choose a king after [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]] had died in [[Kingdom of England|England]] in April 1272. Rudolf's election in [[Frankfurt]] on 1 October 1273,&lt;ref&gt;''Die Habsburger. Eine Europäische Familiengeschichte'', Brigitte Vacha, Sonderausgabe 1996, ''Zeittafel'' p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; when he was 55 years old, was largely due to the efforts of his brother-in-law, the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] burgrave [[Frederick III, Burgrave of Nuremberg|Frederick III of Nuremberg]]. The support of Duke [[Albert II, Duke of Saxony|Albert II of Saxony]] and Elector Palatine [[Louis II, Duke of Bavaria|Louis II]] had been purchased by betrothing them to two of Rudolf's daughters.

As a result, within the electoral college, King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] (1230–1278), himself a candidate for the throne and related to the late Hohenstaufen king [[Philip of Swabia]] (being the son of the eldest surviving daughter), was almost alone in opposing Rudolf. Other candidates were Prince [[Siegfried I, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst|Siegfried I of Anhalt]] and Margrave [[Frederick I, Margrave of Meissen|Frederick I of Meissen]] (1257–1323), a young grandson of the excommunicated Emperor Frederick II, who did not yet even have a principality of his own as his father was still alive. By the admission of Duke [[Henry XIII, Duke of Bavaria|Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria]] instead of the King of Bohemia as the seventh Elector,&lt;ref&gt;Vacha, &quot;1273 wurde Rudolf von Habsburg von den sieben Kurfürsten zum König gewählt&quot; - &quot;statt dem Böhmenkönig dem bayerischen Herzogtum die siebente Kurstimme übertragen wurde&quot;, pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf gained all seven votes.

==King of the Germans==
[[File:Rudolf of Hapsburg Speyer.jpg|thumb|Rudolf of the House of Habsburg, [[Speyer Cathedral]], Germany.]]
Rudolf was crowned in [[Aachen Cathedral]] on 24 October 1273. To win the approbation of the Pope, Rudolf renounced all imperial rights in [[Rome]], the papal territory, and Sicily, and promised to lead a new [[crusade]]. [[Pope Gregory X]], despite the protests of Ottokar II of Bohemia, not only recognised Rudolf himself, but persuaded King [[Alfonso X of Castile]] (another grandson of [[Philip of Swabia]]), who had been chosen German (anti-)king in 1257 as the successor to Count [[William II, Count of Holland|William II of Holland]], to do the same. Thus, Rudolf surpassed the two heirs of the Hohenstaufen dynasty whom he had earlier served so loyally.
[[File:Kaiser Rudolf I. 1275.jpg|thumb|left|Seal with portrait of Rudolf I dated 1275]]

In November 1274, the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] at [[Nuremberg]] decided that all Crown estates seized since the death of the Emperor Frederick II must be restored, and that King Ottokar II must answer to the Diet for not recognising the new king. Ottokar refused to appear or to restore the duchies of [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] and [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] together with the [[March of Carniola]], which he had claimed through his first wife, a [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] heiress, and which he had seized while disputing them with another Babenberg heir, Margrave [[Hermann VI, Margrave of Baden|Hermann VI of Baden]]. Rudolf refuted Ottokar's succession to the Babenberg patrimony, declaring that the provinces reverted to the Imperial crown due to the lack of male-line heirs. King Ottokar was placed under the [[imperial ban]]; and in June 1276 war was declared against him.

Having persuaded Ottokar's former ally [[Henry XIII, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria]] to switch sides, Rudolf compelled the Bohemian king to cede the four provinces to the control of the royal administration in November 1276. Rudolf then re-invested Ottokar with the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], betrothed one of his daughters to Ottokar's son [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]], and made a triumphal entry into [[Vienna]]. Ottokar, however, raised questions about the execution of the treaty, and procured the support of several German princes, again including Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria. To meet this coalition, Rudolf formed an alliance with King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] and gave additional privileges to the Viennese citizens. On 26 August 1278, the rival armies met at the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]], where Ottokar was defeated and killed. The [[Margraviate of Moravia]] was subdued and its government entrusted to Rudolf's representatives, leaving Ottokar's widow [[Kunigunda of Slavonia]] in control of only the province surrounding Prague, while the young Wenceslaus II was again betrothed to Rudolf's youngest daughter [[Judith of Habsburg|Judith]].

[[File:Augsburg, Silver Medal 600th Anniversary of 1282 Hoftag.jpg|thumb|Hoftag Augsburg 1282. Austrian medal commemorating the 600th anniversary the Habsburg Monarchy.]]

Rudolf's attention next turned to the possessions in Austria and the adjacent provinces, which were taken into the royal domain. He spent several years establishing his authority there but found some difficulty in establishing his family as successors to the rule of those provinces. At length the hostility of the princes was overcome. In December 1282, at the [[Hoftag]] (imperial diet) in [[Augsburg]], Rudolf invested his sons, [[Albert I of Germany|Albert]] and [[Rudolf II, Duke of Austria|Rudolf II]], with the duchies of Austria and Styria and so laid the foundation of the House of Habsburg. Additionally, he made the twelve-year-old Rudolf Duke of Swabia, a merely titular dignity, as the duchy had been without an actual ruler since [[Conradin]]'s execution.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The 27-year-old Duke Albert, married since 1274 to a daughter of Count [[Meinhard, Duke of Carinthia|Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol]] (1238–95), was capable enough to hold some sway in the new patrimony.

In 1286, King Rudolf fully invested Albert's father-in-law Count Meinhard with the [[Duchy of Carinthia]], one of the conquered provinces taken from Ottokar. The [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Princes of the Empire]] did not allow Rudolf to give everything that was recovered to the royal domain to his own sons, and his allies needed their rewards too. Turning to the west, in 1281 he compelled Count [[Philip I, Count of Savoy|Philip I of Savoy]] to cede some territory to him, then forced the citizens of [[Bern]] to pay the tribute that they had been refusing. In 1289 he marched against Count Philip's successor, [[Otto IV, Count Palatine of Burgundy|Otto IV]], compelling him to do homage.

In 1281, Rudolf's first wife died. On 5 February 1284, he married [[Isabelle of Burgundy|Isabella]], daughter of Duke [[Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy|Hugh IV of Burgundy]], the Empire's western neighbor in the [[Kingdom of France]].

Rudolf was not very successful in restoring internal peace. Orders were indeed issued for the establishment of landpeaces{{clarify|date=October 2016}} in [[History of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Franconia]] and Swabia, and afterwards for the whole Empire. But the king lacked the power, resources, and determination to enforce them, although in December 1289 he led an expedition into [[Thuringia]], where he destroyed a number of [[Robber baron (feudalism)|robber castles]]. In 1291, he attempted to secure the election of his son Albert as German king. The electors refused, however, claiming inability to support two kings, but in reality, perhaps, wary of the increasing power of the House of Habsburg. Upon Rudolf's death they elected Count [[Adolf, King of Germany|Adolf of Nassau]].

== Death ==
Rudolf died in [[Speyer]] on 15 July 1291 and was buried in [[Speyer Cathedral]]. Although he had a large family, he was survived by only one son, Albert, afterwards the German king [[Albert I of Germany|Albert I]]. Most of his daughters outlived him, apart from [[Catherine of Habsburg, Duchess of Bavaria|Katharina]] who had died in 1282 during childbirth and Hedwig who had died in 1285/6.

Rudolf's reign is most memorable for his establishment of the House of Habsburg as a powerful dynasty in the southeastern part of the realm. In the other territories, the centuries-long decline of Imperial authority since the days of the [[Investiture Controversy]] continued, and the princes were largely left to their own devices.

In [[the Divine Comedy]], [[Dante]] finds Rudolf sitting outside the gates of [[purgatory]] with his contemporaries and berates him as &quot;he who neglected that which he ought to have done&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dante|title=The Divine Comedy; Purgatorio: Canto VII|url=https://archive.org/details/adq2306.0002.001.umich.edu|quote=He who sits highest, and the semblance bears   Of having what he should have done neglected,   And to the others’ song moves not his lips, Rudolph the Emperor was, who had the power   To heal the wounds that Italy have slain,   So that through others slowly she revives.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''===
In the opening chapter of the first novel of the series, Dumbledore arrives at number four, Privet Drive in [[Little Whinging]], [[Surrey]]. When the evil wizard [[Lord Voldemort]] kills Harry's parents before being reduced to a lesser form, Dumbledore decides to place the now-orphaned Harry in the home of [[Dursley family|Vernon and Petunia Dursley]]. He knows that Harry will be protected by the special magic caused by his mother's sacrifice. He reasons that they are the only family he has left with Petunia Evans Dursley being Harry's aunt, who accepting her nephew into their home. This old magic of binding love renders Voldemort incapable of touching Harry. Dumbledore leaves Harry upon the doorstep of the Dursley home with a letter explaining the situation. He departs with the final phrase, &quot;Good luck, Harry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|authorlink=J.K. Rowling|publisher=[[Bloomsbury]]|year=1997|isbn=0-7475-3269-9|location=London, England|chapter=Chapter XII: The Mirror of Erised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, Dumbledore tells him about the secrets of the [[Mirror of Erised]], claiming that when he looks into it, he sees himself &quot;holding a pair of thick, woollen socks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; Harry later recalls in the final book that this was probably the only dishonest answer Dumbledore ever gave him. He is also responsible for somehow enchanting the Mirror so that it hides the [[Sorcerer's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] and only someone who looked into the Mirror and whose desire was &quot;to find the Stone ... but not use it&quot;. The right person would receive it, as anybody else would only see themselves using the Stone due to the Mirror's special magic. He is called out to the [[Ministry of Magic]] by a false message on the night when Harry, his classmates [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]], and Hogwarts professor [[Professor Quirrell|Quirinius Quirrell]] enter the dungeons to retrieve the Stone, but realises during the trip that he is needed at Hogwarts and returns in time to rescue Harry from Quirrell and Voldemort. He also has a final conversation with Harry after the events down in the dungeons and tells him that he is too young to understand why Voldemort is trying to kill him.

===''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''===
In the second novel, a younger Dumbledore appears in a series of flashbacks, seen by Harry in a diary once owned by Tom Riddle, the most gifted student in Hogwarts' history - and the future Lord Voldemort. Through the diary, Harry sees Riddle’s memory of Dumbledore questioning him about a series of attacks on Muggle-born students. In the present, [[Lucius Malfoy]] forces the school's other 11 governors to suspend Dumbledore as Headmaster in the wake of attacks by a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]] in the school when the [[Chamber of Secrets]] is opened. Dumbledore is reinstated when the governors discover that [[Ginny Weasley]] was taken into the Chamber of Secrets and Lucius is found to have coerced the other governors into suspending him.

===''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''===
At the beginning of the third novel, Dumbledore is forced to accept [[Dementors]] onto his school's grounds for the protection of his students from [[Sirius Black]], a supposed murderer and accessory to murder, who had escaped from [[Azkaban]]. After Black's breach into Hogwarts, Dumbledore issues orders to close every entrance to the school and grounds. After Harry falls off his broomstick during a [[Quidditch]] match because of the Dementors, Dumbledore becomes uncharacteristically angry with them and uses his wand to cause Harry to levitate safely to the ground. Later in that book, Dumbledore suggests that Hermione use her Ministry-approved [[Time-Turner]] to go back three hours to save [[Buckbeak]] the [[hippogriff]] and Black from their unjust executions.

===''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''===
In the fourth novel, Dumbledore introduces the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. He also serves as a judge during the entire event. When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, Dumbledore is not enraged, but remains calm; simply asking Harry whether he had himself, or had asked an older student to submit his name (although in the [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|film version]] he does get angry to the point of manhandling Harry). When Harry answers no, he believes him. By the end of the book, Dumbledore's fears are realized when Harry returns from his encounter with Voldemort clutching the dead body of [[Cedric Diggory]] and when [[Mad-Eye Moody]] (being impersonated by [[Barty Crouch Jr]], through Polyjuice Potion) takes Harry away from Dumbledore and to his office inside the castle. Dumbledore immediately becomes suspicious and heads straight towards Moody's office with [[Minerva McGonagall]] and [[Severus Snape]] to save Harry and to interrogate Crouch. Afterwards, Dumbledore listens to Harry's eyewitness account about Voldemort's return. Harry though, only wakes up later to find Minister for Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] in the hospital wing arguing with McGonagall and Dumbledore. In the end, Fudge and Dumbledore &quot;part ways&quot;{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} after an argument about the situation of Voldemort's return and the consequences that would follow should Fudge remain in denial of this fact.

===''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''===
In the fifth book, Dumbledore is demoted from Chief Warlock of the [[Wizengamot]], voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards, and is almost stripped of his Order of Merlin First Class due to his speeches regarding the return of Voldemort, although it is reported that he is unconcerned as long as he is not taken off the Chocolate Frog cards. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Magic does everything they can to discredit him and Harry – mainly through the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. At the beginning of the book, Dumbledore enrages Fudge when he stops by at Harry's [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] with a witness ([[Arabella Figg]]) to ensure that he is not expelled. While Harry feels better when Dumbledore assists him, he becomes annoyed to the point of being angry that the headmaster refuses to speak to or even look at him.

During the following year at Hogwarts, the Ministry passes Educational Decree Twenty-two, allowing Fudge to place [[Dolores Umbridge]] to the post of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher (after Dumbledore failed to find a suitable candidate). Through her, Fudge gradually gains power over Hogwarts and Dumbledore, who he fears is building an under-age wizard army to overthrow the Ministry. Umbridge forbids practical defence practice in her classes, forcing Harry, Ron, and Hermione to form [[Dumbledore's Army]] (a defence group led by Harry) with fellow friends. When the Ministry discovers the D.A., Dumbledore, choosing to accept the responsibility, falsely claims that the organisation was his own subversive creation, and allows himself to be removed as headmaster (for the second time) rather than allow Harry to be expelled.

Dumbledore is not heard of again in the book until he arrives in the [[Department of Mysteries]] to aid the Order in the battle against Voldemort’s followers, the [[Death Eaters]]. He subdues all the Death Eaters, except for [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], and binds them with an Anti-Disapparition Jinx to prevent them from magically escaping. He then saves Harry from the ''[[Avada Kedavra]]'' curse conjured by Voldemort and engages in a ferocious duel with the Dark Lord. This culminates in Voldemort's attempting to possess Harry in an attempt to make Dumbledore kill the boy. Voldemort is forced to leave Harry's body and flee with Lestrange after this ruse fails. Because several ministry officials witnessed the end of the battle, Dumbledore is reinstated as headmaster and retrieves all his distinctions. Towards the end of the book, Dumbledore explains to Harry that Voldemort chose him as his equal and that one must kill the other in the end, and confesses that his great affection for Harry has clouded his judgement.

===''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''===
In the sixth book, Dumbledore fetches Harry from Privet Drive and takes him to persuade [[Horace Slughorn]] to rejoin the Hogwarts staff. Harry notices that Dumbledore's right hand is shrivelled and black. During the school year, Dumbledore teaches Harry of events in Voldemort's past that he feels are of immense importance. Using the Pensieve, they visit the memories of others, which contain important information about Voldemort's life and his [[Genocide|genocidal]] rise to power. While using the [[pensieve]], Harry sees a vision of Dumbledore's first encounter with the young Tom Riddle; Dumbledore had known from the beginning that the boy was dangerous, but believed that Hogwarts would change him.

It is learned that Voldemort created six [[Horcrux]]es to gain [[immortality]] and that they must all be destroyed before Harry goes after the final piece of Voldemort's soul in the Dark Lord's body. Harry also repeatedly warns Dumbledore in most of their lessons that school bully [[Draco Malfoy]] is working for Voldemort. Dumbledore refuses to take any action against Draco, and instead tells Harry that he already knows more about what is happening than Harry does.

By the end of the book, Dumbledore and Harry set out to the cave where Dumbledore believes a Horcrux resides. In the cave, Dumbledore drinks a potion inside the Horcrux's container; while drinking it, he begins to scream, seemingly enduring mental torture and being weakened. Dumbledore begins to call out for water after he finishes the potion, and Harry, realising he has no other choice, dips the goblet into the lake to give him a drink. When he does this though, all the [[Inferius|Inferi]] that reside in the lake grab at Harry and attempt to drag him down and drown him in the lake. Dumbledore suddenly recovers, thanks to the water, and conjures a fire lasso around them. Dumbledore takes the horcrux (a locket) and both make their way back out of the cave and back to Hogsmeade. When they return, [[Madam Rosmerta]] informs them that the [[Dark Mark]] was conjured over the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Astronomy|Astronomy Tower]]. In the tower, Dumbledore enjoins Harry not to interfere in the events that are about to take place there, and places him in a body-binding curse under his invisibility cloak. Hidden, Harry is unable to intervene as Dumbledore (now extremely weak) is disarmed by Draco. Dumbledore is conversing with Draco about the plot to kill him, when several other Death Eaters enter the tower and try to persuade Draco to kill Dumbledore. When Draco hesitates, Snape appears and performs the Killing Curse on Dumbledore, only after Dumbledore pleads with Snape saying, &quot;Severus . . . please...”.  Dumbledore dies on Hogwarts' grounds.

Shortly after his death, Dumbledore's portrait magically appears in the Headmaster's office. His funeral is attended by students, Hogwarts staff, members of the Ministry of Magic, [[Ghosts (Harry Potter)|ghosts]], [[Centaurs (Harry Potter)|centaurs]], [[mermaid|merpeople]] and others who wish to pay their respects. Shrouded in purple velvet, he is entombed in a white marble [[sarcophagus]] beside the lake at Hogwarts, and it is said that he is the only headmaster to be buried on the school grounds.

===''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''===
Rowling used several chapters in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' to reveal two major details concerning Dumbledore: his early life and his death. The book introduces his parents, Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, as well as his little sister, Ariana; his brother, [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], was mentioned in previous books. At six years old, Ariana was attacked by three Muggle boys who had witnessed her performing magic. Because of this attack, Ariana was seriously traumatised and never able to control her magic again. Enraged, Percival attacked the Muggle boys (killing them in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1|film version]]), and was given a life sentence in Azkaban. After this, Kendra moved her family to the village of [[Godric's Hollow]]. In one of her outbursts, Ariana accidentally killed Kendra at around the time that Albus completed his education. Albus became the head of the family and was forced to remain in his house with his sister while Aberforth completed his education.
[[File:The Elder WandII.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|The [[Elder Wand]], as reproduced in ''Harry Potter'' [[Warner Bros.]] films]]
Soon afterward, a young [[Gellert Grindelwald]] arrived in Godric's Hollow to live with his great-aunt, [[Bathilda Bagshot]], author of ''A History of Magic''. The two young men took to each other immediately, and together they dreamed of a world ruled by wizards over Muggles by uniting the legendary [[Deathly Hallows (objects)|Deathly Hallows]]. They believed that if they were forced to destroy a few along the way, it would still be &quot;for the greater good&quot;, and the sufferings and losses would be rewarded a hundredfold in the end. However, this scenario would never happen, as an argument between Albus, Aberforth, and Grindelwald led to a duel that resulted in Ariana's death. For the rest of his life, Albus felt guilty, never certain whether it was his own curse or another's that had killed his sister. Grindelwald stormed back to Bagshot's home and departed to begin his own rule, leaving the country hours later. As a result of his mistakes, Albus felt that he was not to be trusted with power and, because of this, never took the position of Minister for Magic, despite being offered it several times. Dumbledore returned to Hogwarts as professor of Transfiguration, and he served in recruiting students for the school.

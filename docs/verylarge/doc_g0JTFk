On 21 August 1860, during the famous &quot;Battaglia di Piazza Duomo&quot; (Cathedral Square Battle), [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] conquered the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Bruno Antonio Rossi (the mayor of Reggio after the historian Domenico Spanò Bolani, who helped the citizenship during the previous turbulent years) was the first in the kingdom to proclaim the new Garibaldi Dictatorship and the end of the rule of [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies|Francis II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yearning.com/regional/europe/italy/calabria/?cat=provinces/reggio_calabria|title=Yearning.com regional - Find anything anywhere.

On 28 December 1908, at 5:21 AM, the town was hit by a heavy earthquake and shook violently for 31 seconds. Damage was even worse in Messina across the Straits. It is estimated that 25,000 people perished in Reggio and 65,000 in Messina. Reggio lost 27% of its inhabitants and Messina lost 42%. Ten minutes after the catastrophic earthquake, those who tried to escape by running towards the open spaces of the coast were engulfed by a 10-metre-high [[tsunami]]. Three waves of 6–12 metres swept away the whole waterfront. The [[1908 Messina earthquake]] remains one of the worst on record in modern western European history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calabrialiving.com/1908earthquake.htm Reggio Calabria commemorates its 1908 earthquake victims], on Calabria Living&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seismosoc.org/publications/SRL/SRL_80/srl_80-2_hs.html The 28 December 1908 Messina Straits Earthquake (Mw 7.1): A Great Earthquake throughout a Century of Seismology], Historical Seismologist, March/April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the World War II, due to its strategic military position, it suffered a devastating air raid and was used as the [[Operation Baytown|invasion target]] by the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] in 1943, which led to the city's capture. After the war Reggio recovered considerably. During 1970–71 the city was the scene of a popular uprising—known as the [[Reggio riots|Moti di Reggio]]—against the government choice of [[Catanzaro]] as capital of the newly instituted Region of Calabria.&lt;ref name=&quot;partridge50&quot;&gt;Partridge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I-5OR8tDkEIC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=1970+revolt+reggio+calabria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i5EB067Y18&amp;sig=wVYzq_EIUbdQwVmGj0_SPEcnd-c&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=FANOS_LgFdGVtgfdvIHuCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=1970%20revolt%20reggio%20calabria&amp;f=false ''Italian politics today''], p. 50.&lt;!-- ISBN, publishing info needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt was taken over by young [[neofascism|neofascists]] of the [[Italian Social Movement]], backed by the [['Ndrangheta]], a [[Mafia]]-type criminal organisation based in Calabria.&lt;ref name=&quot;paoli198&quot;&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 198.&lt;!-- ISBN, publishing info needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ind040296&quot;&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/town-the-mafia-shut-down-1317203.html Town the mafia shut down], ''The Independent'', 4 February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The Reggio Calabria protests were the expression of malcontent about [[cronyism]] and the lack of industrial planning. In the 1970s and 1980s, Reggio went through twenty years of increasing organized crime by the 'Ndrangheta as well as urban decay. The town is home to several {{Lang|it|[['ndrine]]}}, such as the [[Pasquale Condello|Condello]]-[[Antonio Imerti|Imerti]] and the [[De Stefano 'ndrina|De Stefano]]-[[Giovanni Tegano|Tegano]] clans, who were involved in bloody wars against each other during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;obs240208&quot;&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/24/internationalcrime.italy Godfather's arrest fuels fear of bloody conflict], ''The Observer'', 24 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Ndrangheta extorts protection money (&quot;[[Pizzo (extortion)|pizzo]]&quot;) from every shop and viable business in town and has more power than the city council in awarding licences to retailers.&lt;ref name=ind040296/&gt;

The spiral of corruption reached its zenith in the early 1990s. The sitting mayor at the time, [[Agatino Licandro]], made a confession reporting &quot;suitcases coming into city hall stuffed with money but going out empty&quot;. As a result of the nationwide corruption scandals most of the city council was arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;ind040296&quot;/&gt; Since the early 1990s, the so-called &quot;Primavera di Reggio&quot; (Reggio Spring)—a spontaneous movement of people and government institutions—encouraged city recovery and a renewed and stronger identity. The symbol of the Reggio Spring is the Lungomare Falcomatà, the sea-side boulevard named after Italo Falcomatà, the centre-left mayor who initiated the recovery of the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corrieredellacalabria.it/stories/politica/2205_dieci_anni_senza_italo_il_sindaco_della_primavera_di_reggio_calabria/ Dieci anni senza Italo, il sindaco della primavera di Reggio Calabria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116102742/http://www.corrieredellacalabria.it/stories/politica/2205_dieci_anni_senza_italo_il_sindaco_della_primavera_di_reggio_calabria/ |date=2014-01-16 }}, Corriere della Calabria, 11 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October 2012, the Italian government decided to dissolve the city council of Reggio Calabria for infiltration by the 'Ndrangheta. The move came after some councillors were suspected of having ties to the powerful crime syndicate, under the 10-year centre-right rule of Giuseppe Scopelliti, mayor from 2002 to 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;rep230912&quot;&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2012/09/23/news/sprechi_e_mafia_caos_pdl_in_calabria-43080292 Sprechi e mafia in Calabria], repubblica.it, 23 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, the centre-right mayor Demetrio Arena and all 30 city councillors, were sacked to prevent any &quot;mafia contagion&quot; in the local government. It was the first time that the entire government of a provincial capital had been dismissed over suspected links to organized crime. Three commissioners ran the city for 18 months until a new [[Reggio Calabria municipal election, 2014|election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc091012&quot;&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19886631 Italy sacks Reggio Calabria council over 'mafia ties'], BBC News, 9 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rep091212&quot;&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2012/10/09/news/scioglimento-44197399/ Il Viminale scioglie per mafia il comune di Reggio Calabria], Repubblica.it, 9 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to anti-mafia investigators in 2016, Scopelliti was elected thanks to votes from the 'Ndrangheta.&lt;ref name=&quot;ansa150716&quot;&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2016/07/15/secret-ndrangheta-cupola-picked-men-for-parliament-3_3e4f267e-a038-452d-8f54-8594702f4201.html Secret 'Ndrangheta cupola 'picked men for parliament'], Ansa, July 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthquakes in history===
{{main|List of earthquakes in Italy}}
Reggio has been destroyed by earthquakes several times over the centuries, such as in 91 BC, after which the city was reconstructed by order of the Emperor Augustus, followed by another in the year 17 AD; yet another one in 305 AD, and again another in 374. In 1562 one destroyed the natural, medieval port of the city and brought about the submersion of the Calamizzi promontory, known in ancient times as the Pallantiòn, where, we are told, the first Greek settlers, the Calcidesi, had set foot. The particularly devastating of 1783 and that of 1908, which was the worst natural calamity to take place in Europe in human memory, both profoundly altered the urban aspect of the city, due to the successive re-building which gave the present-day layout of straight, intersecting roads, planned by [[Giovanbattista Mori]] in 1784 and by [[Pietro De Nava]] in 1911. But some town-planning policies at the time were decided upon with no respect for the architectural history of Reggio, as is shown by the demolition of the remaining Norman part of the Castle, following the last big in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Caruso, &quot;Il Castello Aragonese di Reggio Calabria&quot; · Caruso Edizioni, Reggio di C, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===European travellers who visited Reggio===
Although Reggio and Calabria in general were less popular destinations than [[Sicily]] or [[Naples]] for the first Northern European travellers, several famous names such as the Flemish [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] (in c. 1550), the German [[Johann Hermann von Riedesel]] (in 1767), the Frenchmen [[Jean Claude Richard de Saint-Non]] (in 1778) and [[Stendhal]] (in 1817), the British travellers [[Henry Swinburne]] (in c. 1775), [[Richard Keppel Craven]] (in c. 1820), [[Craufurd Tait Ramage]] (in 1828), the Strutt family and [[Elizabeth Byron]] (in 1840), [[Edward Lear]] (in 1847), [[Norman Douglas]] (in 1911), [[D. H. Lawrence]] (in c. 1920) and [[Eric Whelpton]] (in 1950s) and the Belgian [[Jules Destrée]] (in 1915 and in 1930) visited Reggio.&lt;ref&gt;AA VV (attualmente a cura di: Carmelina Sicari, Gaetanina Sicari Ruffo, Luciana Polimeni, Sara Polimeni, Cettina Nostro, Antonio Maria Leone; fondata da Giuseppe Polimeni) ''Calabria Sconosciuta'' · case editrici varie, redazione in Reggio di Calabria, 1978~2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
With an exceptionally high population density, Reggio Calabria was cited as having the least [[Open space reserve|green space]] in a study of 386 European cities. The study reported that green space coverage varied markedly, averaging 18.6 per cent and &quot;ranging from 1.9 (Reggio di Calabria, Italy) to 46 ([[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]], Spain) per cent.&quot;  The study further reported &quot;Per capita green space provision varied by two orders of magnitude, from 3 to 4 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per person in Cádiz, Fuenlabrada and Almería (Spain) and Reggio di Calabria (Italy) to more than 300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in [[Liège]] ([[Belgium]]), [[Oulu]] ([[Finland]]) and [[Valenciennes]] ([[France]]).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;green_space_study&quot;&gt;Richard A.

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Reggio Calabria possesses a typical [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa''). Its climate is mostly identical with Messina which lies on the other side of the strait. Precipitation is the only exception because Messina receives approximately {{convert|300|mm|0|abbr=on}} more.

==Economy==

[[File:Beach of Reggio Calabria.jpg|right|800px|thumb|View on the Strait of Messina by the beach of Reggio Calabria]]
Reggio retains a somewhat rural ambience despite its sizable population. Industry in the city revolves primarily around agriculture and export, fruits, tobacco, [[briar wood|briar]] and the precious essence of the [[bergamot orange|bergamot]] which is used in perfume production. Reggio is a port city with a sizeable fishing industry.

The beaches of the city have become a popular [[tourist destination]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/reggio_di_calabria.jsp|publisher=Questia.com|title=Reggio di Calabria|date=January 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if the sea is often polluted by untreated [[Sanitary sewer|sewers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberareggio.org/2011/05/26/a-reggio-calabria-record-di-reati-ambientali/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327045307/http://www.liberareggio.org/2011/05/26/a-reggio-calabria-record-di-reati-ambientali/ |archive-date=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism is distributed between the Ionian coast (Costa Jonica), the Tyrrhenian coast (the Costa Viola, Purple Coast) and the [[Aspromonte]] mountain behind the city, containing the natural reserve of the [[Aspromonte National Park]] where, at 1,300–1,950 metres above sea level, there is a panoramic view of the [[Strait of Messina]] from the snowy [[mount Etna]] to the [[Aeolian Islands]].

The new waterfront, designed by architect [[Zaha Hadid]], is located on a narrow strait separating [[Italy]] from [[Sicily]]. The museum (13,400 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) draws inspiration from the organic form of the starfish, utilizing a radial symmetry to coordinate communication and circulation between different program elements: exhibition spaces, restoration facilities, archive, aquarium and library. A second, multifunctional building (8,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), comprises two separate elements, placed around a partially covered piazza. It houses offices, gyms, craft laboratories, cinema and flexible auditoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.archiportale.com/news/2009/02/architettura/a-londra-la-firma-per-il-waterfront-di-reggio-calabria_13993_3.html|title=A Londra la firma per il waterfront di Reggio Calabria|publisher=archiportale.com|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campania is the most productive region in [[southern Italy]] [[List of Italian regions by GDP|(and the 7th in the whole country)]] by [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], with [[Naples]]' urban area being the [[List of urban areas in the European Union|7th-most populous in the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Statistics_on_European_cities|title=Statistics on European cities - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=20 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is home to 10 of the 55 [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|UNESCO sites in Italy]], like [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], the [[Royal Palace of Caserta]], the [[Amalfi Coast]] and the [[Historic Centre of Naples]]. Moreover, [[Mount Vesuvius]] is part of the [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=ITA+05&amp;mode=all|title=UNESCO - MAB Biosphere Reserves Directory|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=20 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coastal areas in the region were colonised by the [[Ancient Greeks]] between the 8th and 7th centuries BC, becoming part of the so-called ''[[Magna Graecia]]''. The leading city of Campania at this time was [[Capua]], with [[Naples]] being a Greek-speaking anomaly. Campania is rich in culture, especially in regard to gastronomy, music, architecture, and the presence of archaeological and ancient sites such as Pompeii, Herculaneum, [[Oplontis]], [[Paestum]], [[Aeclanum]], [[Stabiae]], and [[Velia]]. The name of Campania is derived from Latin, as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] knew the region as ''Campania felix'', which translates into English as &quot;fertile countryside&quot; or &quot;happy countryside&quot;. The rich natural beauty of Campania makes it highly important in the tourism industry, with the city of Naples, the Amalfi Coast, Mount Vesuvius, and the islands of Capri and [[Ischia]] continuing to be major attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lifeinitaly.com/tourism/campania/|publisher=LifeInItaly.com|title=Campania: Gateway to Southern Italy|date=7 October 2007|access-date=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient tribes, Etruscan &amp; Greek Colonies, and Samnite Wars===
{{See also|Samnite Wars|Etruscan Civilization|Roman Republic||Pre-Indo-European_languages|Oscan language|Magna Græcia}}
[[File:Paestum BW 2013-05-17 15-08-53.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek Temple of [[Hera]], [[Paestum]], built 550 BC]]
The region today known as ''Campania'' was inhabited since the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, if not earlier, by [[Oscan language|Oscan-speaking]] [[Italic tribes]], namely the [[Osci]], the [[Opici]], the [[Aurunci]], the [[Ausones]], the [[Sidicini]], the [[Hirpini]], the [[Caudini]], the [[Oenotrians]], the [[Campanians]] (where the name of the region stems from) and the [[Lucanians]] (as the southern portion of the region, roughly corresponding to much of modern-day [[province of Salerno|Salerno]], which was considered part of the ancient region of [[Lucania]]).&lt;ref&gt;(Giacomo Devoto, Gli antichi italici, Firenze, Vallecchi, 1931, p.118).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.instoria.it/home/italia_antiqua_XV.htm|publisher=InStoria.it|title=Italia Antiqua – XV, Campania|date=7 October 2007|access-date=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these [[tribe]]s lived in [[Subsistence agriculture|simple]] [[agro-town]]s. There is not much known about the [[Pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Indo-European tribes]] that lived in the region of Campania beforehand, but they were probably not as technologically or culturally advanced as the Oscans. The remaining pre-IE tribes were fully Oscanised by the middle of the first millennium BC.

Between the 9th and 6th centuries BC, the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] from [[Central Italy]] began establishing [[colony|colonies]] in the Campanian Plains (the inland territories of the modern [[province of Caserta|provinces of Caserta]] and [[province of Naples|Naples]]), as well as in the geographical regions of [[Agro Nocerino Sarnese]] and Agro Picentino (both in the modern-day [[province of Salerno]]), where they essentially replicated their [[Etruscan cities|''Dodecapolis'' (twelve cities)]] political model, founding the cities of ''Hyria'' (modern-day [[Nola]]), ''Irnthi'' or ''Marcina'' (modern-day [[Salerno]]), ''Amina'' (modern-day [[Pontecagnano Faiano]]), ''Velcha'', ''Velsu'' and ''Uri''. In addition to [[cultural assimilation|assimilating]] in their [[Urban sociology|urban-political]] domains, the Etruscans also incorporated the pre-existing tribal Oscan agro-towns of ''Capua'' (modern-day [[Santa Maria Capua Vetere]]), ''Nuceria'' (modern-day ''[[comune|comuni]]'' of [[Nocera Superiore]] and [[Nocera Inferiore]]), [[Suessula]], [[Acerra]], [[Ercolano]], [[Pompeii]], [[Stabiae]] and [[Sorrento]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spazioinwind.libero.it/popoli_antichi/Etruschi/Etruria%20Campana.html Etruria campana]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', V (Italia), 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Storia di Nocera. Monumenti, personaggi, leggende|last=Francesco Belsito|publisher=Angri, Gaia|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, during the 8th century BC, [[Ancient Greek language|Greek-speaking people]] from [[Euboea]] (in [[Central Greece]]), known as [[Cumae]]ans, began to establish colonies themselves roughly around the coastal areas of the modern-day [[province of Naples]] and in the [[Phlegraean Islands|nearby islands]] founding, among others, the cities of [[Cumae]], ''Pithekoūsai'' (modern-day [[Ischia]]), [[Paestum]], [[Herculaneum]] and ''Dicaearchia'' , later 'Puteoli', in latin (modern-day [[Pozzuoli]]). The city of [[Naples]] began as a small commercial port called [[History of Naples#Greek birth, Roman acquisition|Parthenope]] (Παρθενόπη, meaning &quot;Pure Eyes&quot;, a Siren in [[Greek mythology]]), which was established by Greek colonial sailors from [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;campaniahistoryone&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iterteam.it/eng/campania/storia.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505081832/http://www.iterteam.it/eng/campania/storia.html|archive-date=5 May 2005|publisher=Interteam.it|title=Campania: History|date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aeclanum (Ruins-03).jpg|thumb|Ruins of the Hirpini town of [[Aeclanum]].]]

At one point in history, a distinct group of Oscan-speaking tribes from [[Samnium]] (in south-central Italy), the [[Samnites]], moved down into Campania.
Since the Samnites were more warlike than the other Oscan populations, they easily took over the cities of [[Capua]] and Cumae, in an area which was one of the most prosperous and fertile in the [[Italian Peninsula]] at the time.&lt;ref name = &quot;samnite wars&quot;/&gt; During the 340s BC, the Samnites were engaged in a war with the [[Roman Republic]] in a dispute known as the [[Samnite Wars]], with Rome claiming the rich pastures of northern Campania during the [[Samnite Wars|First Samnite War]].&lt;ref name = &quot;pirat&quot;/&gt; The First Samnite War was initiated when the Etruscan-influenced Oscan city of Capua (in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] ''Capeva'') was being attacked by the Samnites, and thus appealed to Rome for defensive help.

As the majority of [[Southern Italy]] was under Roman control at the time, the sole major remaining independent settlement in the region was the [[Greeks|Greek]] colony of [[Naples|Neapolis]], and when the city was eventually [[Capture of Neapolis|captured by the Samnites]], the Neapolitan Greeks were left with no option but to call on the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], with whom they established an alliance, setting off the [[Second Samnite War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;samnite wars&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unrv.com/empire/samnite-wars.php|publisher=UNRV.com|title=The Samnite Wars|date=7 October 2007|access-date=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Consul|Roman consul]] Quintus Publilius Filo recaptured Neapolis by 326 BC and allowed it to remain a Greek city with some autonomy as a ''[[civitas]] foederata'' while strongly aligned with Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;romannaples&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Roman_Naples.html|publisher=Faculty.ed.umuc.du|title=Roman Naples|date=7 October 2007|access-date=22 July 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629003110/http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Roman_Naples.html|archive-date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Samnite War ended with the Romans controlling all of southern Campania and additional regions further to the south, such as parts of [[Lucania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pirat&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pirate.shu.edu/~vigorimi/genealogy/first_millenium_BC.html|publisher=Michael Vigorita|title=Ancient Times – 1st millennium B.C.|date=7 October 2007|access-date=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campania was a full-fledged part of the [[Roman Republic]] by the end of the 4th century BC, valued for its [[pastures]] and rich countryside. Naples, with its [[Greek language]] and customs, made it a centre of Hellenistic culture for the Romans, creating the first traces of [[Greco-Roman]] culture.&lt;ref name = &quot;rome&quot;/&gt; During the [[Pyrrhic War]] in 275 BC, the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] took place in Campania in the Samnite city of Maleventum, in which the Romans, led by the consul [[Curius Dentatus]], were victorious.

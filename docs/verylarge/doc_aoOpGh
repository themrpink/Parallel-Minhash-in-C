{{British cuisine}}

'''Fish and chips''' is a hot dish consisting of [[fried fish]] in [[batter (cooking)|batter]] served with [[French fries|chips]]. The dish originated in [[English cuisine|England]] and is an example of [[culinary fusion]], combining Iberian Jewish fried fish with Belgian fried potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Black |first1=Les |title=New Ethnicities and Urban Culture |date=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZn7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85728-251-5 |access-date=14 February 2019 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Alexander |first=James |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8419026.stm |title=The unlikely origin of fish and chips |work=BBC News |date=18 December 2009 |access-date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish and chips is a common [[Take-out|take-away food]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and numerous other countries, particularly in English-speaking and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations. 

Fish and chips first appeared in the UK in the 1860s, and by 1910, there were over 25,000 [[fish and chip shop]]s across the UK. By the 1930s there were over 35,000 shops, but the trend reversed and by 2009 there were only approximately 10,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander&quot; /&gt; 

The British Government safeguarded the supply of fish and chips during the [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]] and it was one of the few foods in the UK [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|not subject to rationing]] during the wars.

==History==
{{Main|English cuisine}}

The tradition in the UK of fish battered and fried in oil may have come from [[Western Sephardim|Western Sephardic Jewish]] immigrants from Holland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roden 1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Claudia|last1=Roden|title=The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIgrAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Knopf|date=1996 |isbn=9780394532585|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hosking|first1=Richard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfP6jHmSLnMC&amp;pg=PT183 |title=Eggs in Cookery:Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium of Food and Cookery 2006|date=2007|publisher=Prospect Books|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-903018-54-5|page=183}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;marks&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Marks | first = Gil | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux2lGKCKVPYC&amp;pg=PA82 |title = The world of Jewish cooking: more than 500 traditional recipes from Alsace to Yemen | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-684-83559-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originating in Spain and Portugal and settling in England as early as the 16th century, they would have prepared fried fish in a manner similar to ''[[pescado frito]]'', which is coated in [[flour]] then fried in oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;marks&quot;/&gt; Fish fried for [[Shabbat]] for dinner on Friday evenings could be eaten cold the following afternoon for [[shalosh seudot]], palatable this way as liquid vegetable oil was used rather than a hard fat, such as butter.&lt;ref name=&quot;marks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Majumdar |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Majumdar |access-date=27 December 2019|title=The Good Companions: The True Story of Fish &amp; Chips|url=https://www.eatmyglobe.com/fish-and-chips|website=Eat My Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Dickens]] mentions &quot;fried fish warehouses&quot; in ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1838),&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander&quot; /&gt; and in 1845 [[Alexis Soyer]] in his first edition of ''A Shilling Cookery for the People'', gives a recipe for &quot;Fried fish, Jewish fashion&quot;, which is dipped in a batter of flour and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chip-Shop Fried Fish|url=http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/chipshopfriedfish.htm|website=The Foods of England Project|access-date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact location of the first [[fish and chip shop]] is unclear.

Fish and chips became a stock meal among the working classes in England as a consequence of the rapid development of [[trawling|trawl fishing]] in the [[North Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p039pr7c?intc_type=promo&amp;intc_location=sport&amp;intc_campaign=fishandchips&amp;intc_linkname=radio4_fac_audioclip1|title=Did fish and chips come from the north of England?|publisher=BBC Radio 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of railways which connected the ports to major industrial cities during the second half of the 19th century, so that fresh fish could be rapidly transported to the heavily populated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niagara.co.uk/fish_and_chips.htm |title=Fish and chips - A great English tradition |access-date=22 June 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080116221706/http://www.niagara.co.uk/fish_and_chips.htm |archive-date = 16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep-fried chips (slices or pieces of potato) as a dish may have first appeared in England in about the same period: the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' notes as its earliest usage of &quot;chips&quot; in this sense the mention in Charles Dickens' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1859): &quot;husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-h/98-h.htm#link2H_4_0002|title=A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens|website=www.gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16391511|title=The master of the snippet|first=Matthew|last=Davis|work=BBC News|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c54xAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=tale+of+two+cities|title=A Tale of Two Cities|first=Charles|last=Dickens|date=24 January 1866|publisher=Chapman and Hall|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; originated in the United Kingdom, although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe. Early fish-and-chip shops had only very basic facilities. Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of cooking fat, heated by a coal fire. The fish-and-chip shop later evolved into a fairly standard format, with the food served, in paper wrappings, to queuing customers, over a counter in front of the fryers. As a boy, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] lived above a fish and chip shop in London, which was the family business.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, Patrick (2003). Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light. p. 13. Regan Books.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor John Walton, author of ''Fish and Chips and the British Working Class'', the British government made safeguarding supplies of fish and chips during [[World War I]] a priority: &quot;The cabinet knew it was vital to keep families on the home front in good heart, unlike the German regime that failed to keep its people well fed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander&quot;/&gt;

In 1928, [[Harry Ramsden's|Harry Ramsden]] opened his first fish and chip shop in [[Guiseley]], West Yorkshire. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish and chips, earning a place in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]''. In [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'' (1937), which documents his experience of working class life in the north of England, the author considered fish and chips chief among the 'home comforts' which acted as a panacea to the working classes.

During [[World War II]], fish and chips—a staple of the working class—remained one of the few foods in the United Kingdom [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|not subject to rationing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rls.org.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-000-001-467-L |title=Resources for Learning, Scotland: Rationing |publisher=Rls.org.uk |date=5 January 1998 |access-date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] referred to the combination of fish and chips as &quot;the good companions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander&quot;/&gt;

British fish and chips were originally served in a wrapping of old newspapers but this practice has now largely ceased, with plain paper, cardboard, or plastic being used instead.

[[File:Oldham - first chip shop in UK.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[blue plaque]] in [[Oldham]] ([[Greater Manchester]]) in England marking the 1860s origins of the [[fish and chip shop]] and the [[fast food]] industry]]
A prominent meal in British culture, fish and chips became popular in wider circles in London and South East England in the middle of the 19th century: [[Charles Dickens]] mentions a &quot;fried fish warehouse&quot; in ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', first published in 1838, while in the north of England a trade in deep-fried chipped potatoes developed. The first chip shop stood on the present site of [[Oldham]]'s Tommyfield Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaloner|first1=W. H.|last2=Henderson|first2=W. O.|title=Industry and Innovation: Selected Essays|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1990|isbn=0-7146-3335-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear exactly when and where these two trades combined to become the modern [[fish and chip shop]] industry. A Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin, opened the first recorded combined fish-and-chip shop in London in 1860; a Mr Lees pioneered the concept in the North of England, in [[Mossley]], in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Historic uk - the heritage accommodation guide |url=http://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/FishandChips.htm |title=Tradition Historic UK, Fish and Chips |publisher=Historic-uk.com |access-date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a fish restaurant, as opposed to take-away, was introduced by Samuel Isaacs (born 1856 in [[Whitechapel]], London; died 1939 in [[Brighton]], Sussex) who ran a thriving wholesale and retail fish business throughout London and the South of England in the latter part of the 19th century. Isaacs' first restaurant opened in London in 1896 serving fish and chips, bread and butter, and tea for nine pence,&lt;ref&gt;England Eats Out by John Burnett - Published by Pearson Education, 2004 {{ISBN|0-582-47266-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its popularity ensured a rapid expansion of the chain.

[[File:Fish and chips.jpg|thumb|right|Deep-fried [[plaice]] and chips on the seafront at [[Hunstanton]]. Fish and chips is associated with [[seaside resort]]s. ]]
The restaurants were carpeted, had table service, tablecloths, flowers, china and cutlery, and made the trappings of upmarket dining affordable to the working classes for the first time. They were located in London, [[Clacton]], Brighton, [[Ramsgate]], [[Margate]] and other seaside resorts in southern England. Menus were expanded in the early 20th century to include meat dishes and other variations as their popularity grew to a total of thirty restaurants. Sam Isaacs' trademark was the phrase &quot;This is the [[Plaice]]&quot;, combined with a picture of the punned-upon fish in question. A glimpse of the old Brighton restaurant at No.1 Marine Parade can be seen in the background of [[Norman Wisdom]]'s 1955 film ''[[One Good Turn (1955 film)|One Good Turn]]'' just as Pitkin runs onto the seafront; this is now the site of a [[Harry Ramsden's]] fish and chips restaurant. A [[blue plaque]] at Oldham's Tommyfield Market marks the first chips fried in England in 1860, and the origin of the fish and chip shop and [[fast food]] industries.

[[Dundee]] City Council claims that chips were first sold by a Belgian immigrant, Edward De Gernier, in the city's Greenmarket in the 1870s.&lt;ref name=dundee&gt;{{cite web|title=Dundee Fact File |publisher=Dundee City Council |url=http://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/departments/fact.htm |access-date=20 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408055244/http://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/departments/fact.htm |archive-date=8 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Edinburgh]] and the surrounding area, a combination of Gold Star [[brown sauce]] and water or malt vinegar, known as &quot;sauce&quot;, or more specifically as &quot;chippy sauce&quot;, has great popularity;&lt;ref name=&quot;FFF&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federationoffishfriers.co.uk/pages/81.htm |title=Did You Know? |publisher=Federation of Fish Friers |access-date=22 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923220940/http://www.federationoffishfriers.co.uk/pages/81.htm |archive-date=23 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[salt and vinegar]] is preferred elsewhere in Scotland, often prompting light-hearted debate on the merits of each option by those who claim to find the alternative a baffling concept.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/scotlands-sauce-wars-charge-for-ketchup-in-edinburgh-leaves-customer-from-glasgow-with-chip-on-8786768.html |title=Scotland's sauce wars: Charge for ketchup in Edinburgh leaves customer from Glasgow with chip on shoulder |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=27 August 2013 |access-date=22 March 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Record 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-chippies-get-ready-for-the-salt-and-sauce-1119494.amp|title=Glasgow chippies get ready for the 'salt and sauce' Scottish Cup Final|newspaper=Daily Record |date=18 April 2012|access-date=22 March 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh News 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/salt-n-sauce-capital-chippy-sauce-export-bid-1-2880928/amp |title=Salt 'n' sauce?

===Australia===
{{Main|Australian cuisine}}
The first recorded owner of an Australian fish and chip shop is Greek migrant Athanasias Comino, who opened his shop in 1879 on Sydney's Oxford Street, though Comino's shop was inspired by an unknown Welshman's pre-existing fish and chip shop.&lt;ref name=&quot;aus-frdc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Fish and Chips |url=http://fishandchipsawards.com.au/Information/The-History-of-Fish-and-Chips |website=Australian Fish and Chips Awards |publisher=[[Fisheries Research and Development Corporation]] |access-date=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia today, there are an estimated 4000 fish and chip shops, as well as fish and chips being an essential menu offering in many [[Australian pubs]] and restaurants.&lt;ref name=&quot;aus-frdc&quot; /&gt;

===Ireland===
{{Main|Irish cuisine}}
In [[Ireland]], the first fish and chips were sold by an Italian immigrant, Giuseppe Cervi, who mistakenly stepped off a North American-bound ship at Queenstown (now [[Cobh]]) in [[County Cork]] in the 1880s and walked all the way to Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/food-drink/national-fish-and-chips-day-thank-cod-for-giuseppe-2656484.html |title=National Fish and Chips Day: Thank cod for Giuseppe |work= Irish Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started by selling fish and chips outside Dublin pubs from a handcart. He then found a permanent spot in Great Brunswick Street (now [[Pearse Street]]). His wife Palma would ask customers &quot;Uno di questa, uno di quella?&quot; This phrase (meaning &quot;one of this, one of that&quot;) entered the [[vernacular]] in Dublin as &quot;one and one&quot;, which is still a way of referring to fish and chips in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hegarty 2009 17&quot;/&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{Main|New Zealand cuisine}}
Fish and chips is the most popular takeaway food in New Zealand. Food historians have not been able to pinpoint exactly when the meal became an established part of New Zealand cuisine but all recognise that the first fish and chips shops were introduced by British settlers before [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wassilieff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wassilieff|first1=Maggy|title=Seafood - Favourite Kiwi fare|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/seafood/page-2|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=15 December 2017|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, nearly every small town and suburb in New Zealand had at least one fish-and-chip shop. As in Britain, Friday night has been the traditional night to eat fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wassilieff&quot;/&gt;

Traditionally, fish and chips were served in wrappings of greaseproof paper and then newspaper as insulation.  With the decline of the newspaper industry, this has become less common although plain, unprinted paper is still popular.

In 1980, four up-and-coming [[New Zealand Labour Party]] politicians, including [[David Lange]], were nicknamed the &quot;[[Fish and Chip Brigade]]&quot; due to a picture published at the time with the group eating fish and chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seafood - Favourite Kiwi fare: The Fish and Chip Brigade|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/5099/the-fish-and-chip-brigade|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the dish is most commonly sold as ''fish and chips'', except in [[Upstate New York]] and [[Wisconsin]] and other parts of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Upper Midwest]], where this dish would be called a ''[[fish fry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shore Lunch: More Than the World's Finest Fish and Chips – New West|url=https://newwest.net/topic/article/shore_lunch_more_than_the_worlds_finest_fish_and_chips/C41/L41/|website=newwest.net|publisher=New West Publications|access-date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the name ''fish and chips'', and the US meaning of ''chips'' as [[potato chips]], the dish is served with [[french fries]] (much thinner than British and Irish chips).&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot;/&gt; However, some restaurants will use thicker french fries which are known as ''steak fries''. These fries are closer to British chips. In the [[Southern United States]], a common form of cuisine is fried [[catfish]] with french fries, accompanied by [[coleslaw]], pickles, raw onion slices and lemon slices.

==Composition==

===Cooking===
[[File:Frying range.JPG|thumb|Frying range]]
Traditional frying uses [[tallow|beef dripping]] or [[lard]]; however, [[vegetable oil]]s, such as [[palm oil]], [[rapeseed]] or  [[peanut oil]] (used because of its relatively high [[smoke point]]) {{As of|2007|alt= now}} predominate. A minority of vendors in the [[North of England]] and [[Scotland]], and the majority of vendors in [[Northern Ireland]], still use dripping or lard, as it imparts a different flavour to the dish, but this makes the fried chips unsuitable for vegetarians and for adherents of certain faiths. Lard is used in some living industrial history museums, such as the [[Black Country Museum|Black Country Living Museum]]. All of the fish is filleted and no bones should be found in the fish.{{Citation needed|reason=From what I have heard, there seem to be quite a lot of fish and chip shops in the UK that still use animal fats for frying, so a source to show that most now use vegetable oil should be given.|date=September 2019}}

===Thickness===
British chips are usually thicker than American-style french fries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Chips, fries or crisps? The internet is divided over potato snack names |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/chips-fries-crisps-debate-twitter-potato-snacks-names-worldwide-a8523486.html |access-date=23 March 2019 |work=The Independent|quote=In line with British terminology, the chunky, thick, fried and floury variety should be called chips. Meanwhile, the slimmer and crispier options - a staple in fast food restaurants and American diners - are fries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their homes or in some restaurants, people in or from the United States may eat a thick type of chip, more similar to the British variant, sometimes referred to as ''steak fries''.

===Batter===
In Britain and Ireland,  fish and chip shops traditionally use a simple water and flour [[Batter (cooking)|batter]], adding a little [[sodium bicarbonate]] (baking soda) and a little vinegar to create lightness, as they react to create bubbles in the batter. Other recipes may use beer or milk batter, where these liquids are often substitutes for water. The [[carbon dioxide]] in the beer lends a lighter texture to the batter. Beer also results in an orange-brown colour. A simple beer batter might consist of a 2:3 ratio of flour to beer by volume. The type of beer alters the taste of the batter; some prefer [[lager]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/database/deepfriedfishinbeerb_67776.shtml|title=Deep fried fish in beer|access-date=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/recipes/gurnard-in-beer-batter-772989.html|title=Gurnard in beer batter|date=26 January 2008|access-date=23 March 2009 | work=The Independent | location=London | first=Mark | last=Hix}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others use [[stout]] or [[bitter (beer)|bitter]].

===Choice of fish===
In Britain and Ireland, [[cod]] and [[haddock]] appear most commonly as the fish used for fish and chips,&lt;ref name=onplate&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Masterson, tictoc design |url=http://www.seafish.org/plate/fishandchips.asp |title=&quot;Seafish.

In traditional fish and chip shops several varieties of fish are offered by name (&quot;haddock and chips&quot;), but in some restaurants and stalls &quot;fish and chips&quot;, unspecified, is offered; it is increasingly likely to be the much cheaper basa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/3348646/It-s-basa-and-chips-as-shoppers-choose-sustainable-fish.html |title=It-s basa-and-chips as shoppers choose sustainable fish |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date= 3 August 2008 |author=Jasper Copping |access-date= 18 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Northern Ireland]], cod, plaice or [[whiting (fish)|whiting]] appear most commonly in 'fish suppers'—'supper' being Scottish and Northern Irish chip-shop terminology for a food item accompanied by chips.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/aug/19/stonehaven-bay-best-fish-and-chips-food-award &quot;Yes, this really is the best fish supper money can buy&quot;].

[[File:Fish-and-chips-horseshoe-bay.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cod]] and chips, served with a lemon wedge and [[tartar sauce]]]]

In Australia, reef cod and [[rock cod]] (a different variety from that used in the United Kingdom), [[barramundi]] or [[flathead (fish)|flathead]] (more expensive options), [[flake (fish)|flake]] (a type of [[shark meat]]), [[King George whiting]] (little more expensive than other fish, but cheaper than barramundi or flathead) or [[Australasian snapper|snapper]] (cheaper options), are commonly used. From the early 21st century, farmed [[Basa fish|basa]] imported from Vietnam and [[Blue grenadier|hoki]] have become common in Australian fish and chip shops. Other types of fish are also used based on regional availability.

In New Zealand, [[Australasian snapper|snapper]] or [[Triglidae|gurnard]] was originally the preferred species for battered fillets in the North Island. As catches of this fish declined, it was replaced by hoki, shark (particularly [[spotted estuary smooth-hound|rig]]) – marketed as lemon fish – and [[tarakihi]]. [[Bluefin gurnard]] and [[blue cod]] predominate in South Island fish and chips.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wassilieff&quot;/&gt;

In the United States, the type of fish used depends on availability in a given region. Some common types are cod, [[halibut]], [[flounder]], [[tilapia]] or, in [[New England]], [[Atlantic cod]] or haddock. Salmon is growing common on the West Coast, while freshwater [[catfish]] is most frequently used in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In India, the dish is usually based on [[pomfret]] fish, and uses chilli paste, and more pepper than would be used in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food/food-reviews/Fish-n-chips-a-great-Indian-delicacy/articleshow/10065191.cms|title=Fish n' chips, a great Indian delicacy|date=9 February 2012|newspaper=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chip shops in most parts of Britain and Ireland, [[edible salt|salt]] and [[vinegar]] are traditionally sprinkled over fish and chips at the time it is served.&lt;ref name=onplate/&gt; Suppliers use [[malt vinegar]], onion vinegar (used for pickling onions), or the cheaper [[non-brewed condiment]].

In Ireland, Wales and England, most takeaways serve warm side portions of sauces such as [[curry]] sauce or [[gravy]]. The sauces are usually poured over the chips. In some areas, this dish without fish is referred to as 'wet chips'.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} In the Midlands especially, chips with mushy peas or [[baked beans]] is known as a &quot;pea mix&quot; or a &quot;bean mix&quot;. Other fried products include '[[Scraps (batter)|scraps]]' (also known as 'bits' in Southern England and &quot;scrumps&quot; in South Wales), originally a by-product of fish frying. Still popular in Northern England, they were given as treats to the children of customers. Portions prepared and sold today consist of loose blobs of batter, deep fried to a crunchy golden crisp in the cooking-fat. The potato scallop or potato cake consists of slices of potato dipped in fish batter and deep fried until golden brown. These are often accompanied for dipping by the warm sauces listed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2007/jul/13/doyouknowwhatscrapsarean |title=Do you know what scraps are?

In the US, [[tartar sauce]] is commonly served with fish and chips.

There are distinct regional variations in how accompaniments are added to the meal where it is as a take away – related partly to whether the food is entirely wrapped in paper. In some shops the customer is expected to add these; in others the expectation is that the server does so.

===Nutrition information===
An average serving of fish and chips consisting of 6 ounces (170 grams) of fried fish with 10 ounces (280 grams) of fried chips has approximately 1,000 calories and contains approximately 52 grams of fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Serving the Fish and Chips Industry - Nutritional info | publisher=[[National Federation of Fish Friers]] | date=29 March 2018 | url=http://www.federationoffishfriers.co.uk/pages/nutritional-info-605.htm | access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of tartar sauce as a condiment adds more calories and fat to the dish.

In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, fish and chips are usually sold by independent restaurants and [[take-away]]s known as [[fish and chip shop]]s. Outlets range from small affairs to chain restaurants. Locally owned seafood restaurants are also popular in many places, as are mobile &quot;[[chip van]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilecateringuk.co.uk/how-to-start-up-mobile-catering-business.htm |title=Starting a Mobile Catering Business in UK |publisher=Mobilecateringuk.co.uk |access-date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the outlets may be referred to as &quot;chip wagons&quot;.

In Ireland, the majority of traditional vendors are migrants or the descendants of migrants from southern Italy. A trade organisation exists to represent this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itica.ie/ |title=ITICA - Irish Traditional Italian Chipper Association, chippers in Ireland, Irish chippers, Fish and Chip Day — ITICA |publisher=Itica.ie |access-date=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish-and-chip shops traditionally wrapped their product in newspaper, or with an inner layer of white paper (for hygiene) and an outer layer of newspaper or blank [[newsprint]] (for insulation and to absorb grease), though the use of newspaper for wrapping has almost ceased on grounds of hygiene. {{As of|2007|alt= Nowadays}}, establishments usually use food-quality wrapping paper, occasionally printed on the outside to imitate newspaper.

The British [[National Federation of Fish Friers]] was founded in 1913. It promotes fish and chips and offers training courses. It has about 8,500 members from around the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federationoffishfriers.co.uk/|title=NFFF home page|access-date=26 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

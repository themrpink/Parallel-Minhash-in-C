Large estates produced cash crops for export and used the resulting revenues to import food and urban manufactured goods. This resulted in a great deal of economic interdependence among the empire's inhabitants. The historian Henry St. Lawrence Beaufort Moss describes the situation as it stood before the crisis:

{{quote |Along these roads passed an ever-increasing traffic, not only of troops and officials but of traders, merchandise and even tourists. An interchange of goods between the various provinces rapidly developed, which soon reached a scale unprecedented in the previous history and not repeated until a few centuries ago. Metals mined in the uplands of Western Europe, hides, fleeces, and livestock from the pastoral districts of Britain, Spain, and the shores of the Black Sea, wine and oil from Provence and Aquitaine, timber, pitch and wax from South Russia and northern Anatolia, [[dried fruit]]s from Syria, marble from the Aegean coasts, and – most important of all – grain from the wheat-growing districts of North Africa, Egypt, and the Danube Valley for the needs of the great cities; all these commodities, under the influence of a highly organized system of transport and marketing, moved freely from one corner of the Empire to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/birthofthemiddle027632mbp |title=The Birth of the Middle Ages 395–814 |last=Henry St. Lawrence Beaufort Moss |date=1935 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/birthofthemiddle027632mbp/page/n140 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the onset of the Crisis of the Third Century, however, this vast internal trade network broke down. The widespread civil unrest made it no longer safe for merchants to travel as they once had, and the financial crisis that struck made exchange very difficult with the debased currency. This produced profound changes that, in many ways, foreshadowed the very decentralized economic character of the coming [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;H. St. L. B. Moss, [https://archive.org/details/birthofthemiddle027632mbp ''The Birth of the Middle Ages'']  (Clarendon Press, 1935, reprint Oxford University Press, January 2000) {{ISBN|0-19-500260-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large landowners, no longer able to successfully export their crops over long distances, began producing food for subsistence and local barter. Rather than import manufactured goods from the empire's great urban areas, they began to manufacture many goods locally, often on their own estates, thus beginning the self-sufficient &quot;house economy&quot; that would become commonplace in later centuries, reaching its final form in the [[manorialism]] of the Middle Ages. The common, free people of the Roman cities, meanwhile, began to move out into the countryside in search of food and better protection.&lt;ref&gt; H. St. L. B. Moss, [https://archive.org/details/birthofthemiddle027632mbp ''The Birth of the Middle Ages'']  (Clarendon Press, 1935, reprint Oxford University Press, January 2000) {{ISBN|0-19-500260-1}} pp. 29-30 &lt;/ref&gt;

Made desperate by economic necessity, many of these former city dwellers, as well as many small farmers, were forced to give up hard-earned basic civil rights in order to receive protection from large land-holders. In doing so, they became a half-free class of Roman citizen known as ''[[Colonus (person)|coloni]]''. They were tied to the land, and in later Imperial law, their status was made hereditary. This provided an early model for [[serfdom]], the origins of medieval [[feudal society]] and of the medieval peasantry. The decline in commerce between the imperial provinces put them on a path toward increased self-sufficiency. Large landowners, who had become more self-sufficient, became less mindful of Rome's central authority, particularly in the Western Empire, and were downright hostile toward its tax collectors. The measure of wealth at this time began to have less to do with wielding urban civil authority and more to do with controlling large agricultural estates in rural regions since this guaranteed access to the only economic resource of real value — agricultural land and the crops it produced. The common people of the empire lost economic and political status to the land-holding nobility, and the commercial middle classes waned along with their trade-derived livelihoods. The Crisis of the Third Century thus marked the beginning of a long gradual process that would transform the ancient world of Classical antiquity into the medieval one of the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;  H. St. L. B. Moss, [https://archive.org/details/birthofthemiddle027632mbp ''The Birth of the Middle Ages'']  (Clarendon Press, 1935, reprint Oxford University Press, January 2000) {{ISBN|0-19-500260-1}} pp. 26, 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although the burdens on the population increased, especially the lower strata of the population, this can not be generalized to the whole empire, especially since the living conditions were not uniform. Although the structural integrity of the economy suffered from the military conflicts of that time and the inflationary episode of the 270s, it did not collapse, especially because of the complex regional differences. Recent research has shown that there were regions that prospered even further, such as Egypt, Africa and Hispania. But even for Asia Minor, which was directly affected by attacks, no general decline can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Deleto paene imperio Romano: Transformationsprozesse des Römischen Reiches im 3. Jahrhundert und ihre Rezeption in der Neuzeit |last=Ruffing |first=Kai |date=2006 |publisher=Steiner |isbn=978-3-515-08941-8 |location=Stuttgart |page=223 |oclc=180946164}}&lt;/ref&gt; While commerce and the economy flourished in several regions, with several provinces not affected by hostilities, other provinces experienced some serious problems, as evidenced by personal [[hoards]] in the northwestern provinces of the empire. However, there can be no talk of a general economic crisis throughout the whole of Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rome and its Empire, AD 193–284 |last=Hekster, Olivier. |date=2008 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-2992-3 |location=Edinburgh |page=31 |oclc=271165910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the Roman cities began to change in character. The large cities of classical antiquity slowly gave way to the smaller, [[walled city|walled cities]] that became common in the Middle Ages. These changes were not restricted to the third century, but took place slowly over a long period, and were punctuated with many temporary reversals. In spite of extensive reforms by later emperors, however, the Roman trade network was never able to fully recover to what it had been during the [[Pax Romana]] (27 BC-AD 180). This economic decline was far more noticeable and important in the western part of the empire, which was also invaded by barbarian tribes several times during the century. Hence, the balance of power clearly shifted eastward during this period, as evidenced by the choice of Diocletian to rule from [[Nicomedia]] in [[Asia Minor]], putting his second in command, [[Maximian]], in [[Milan]]. This would have a considerable impact on the later development of the empire with a richer, more stable [[Eastern Roman Empire|eastern empire]] surviving the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|end of Roman rule in the west]].&lt;ref&gt;H. St. L. B. Moss, [https://archive.org/details/birthofthemiddle027632mbp ''The Birth of the Middle Ages'']  (Clarendon Press, 1935, reprint Oxford University Press, January 2000) {{ISBN|0-19-500260-1}} pp. 7, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

While imperial revenues fell, imperial expenses rose sharply. More soldiers, greater proportions of cavalry, and the ruinous expense of walling in cities all added to the toll. Goods and services previously paid for by the government were now demanded in addition to monetary taxes. The empire suffered from a crippling labour shortage. The steady exodus of both rich and poor from the cities and now-unprofitable professions forced [[Diocletian]] to use compulsion; conscription was made universal, most trades were made hereditary, and workers could not legally leave their jobs or travel elsewhere to seek better-paying ones. This included the unwanted middle-class civil service positions and under Constantine, the military. Constantine also tried to provide social programs for the poor to reduce the labour shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joseph Tainter |title=The Collapse of Complex Societies |date=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=052138673X |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased militarization===
All the Barracks Emperors based their power on the military and on the soldiers of the field armies, not on the Praetorians in Rome. Thus, Rome lost its role as the political center of the empire during the third century, although it remained ideologically important. In order to legitimize and secure their rule, the emperors of the third century needed above all military successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johne |first1=Klaus-Peter |last2=Hartmann |first2=Udo |last3=Gerhardt |first3=Thomas |title=Die Zeit der Soldatenkaiser: Krise und Transformation des Römischen Reiches im 3. Jahrhundert n. Chr. (235–284) |date=2008 |publisher=Akademie Verlag |location=Rome |isbn=978-3050045290 |page=1026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre of decision-making shifted away from Rome and to wherever the emperor was with his armies, typically, in the east. This led to the transfer of the capital to the four cities Milan, Trier, Nicomedia, and Sirmium, and then to Constantinople. The Senate ceased to be the main governing organ and instead members of the equestrian class who filled the military officer corps became increasingly prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alaric Watson |title=Aurelian and the Third Century |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1134908156 |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emperors ==
{{main|List of Roman emperors#235–285: Crisis of the Third Century}}

Several emperors who rose to power through acclamation of their troops attempted to create stability by appointing their descendants as ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', resulting in several brief dynasties. These generally failed to maintain any form of coherence beyond one generation, although there were exceptions.

'''Joseph of Arimathea''' was, according to all four [[Gospel#Canonical gospels|canonical gospels]], the man who assumed responsibility for the [[burial of Jesus]] after [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]]. The historical location of [[Arimathea]] is uncertain, although it has been identified with several towns. A number of stories that developed during the [[Middle Ages]] connect him with [[Glastonbury]], England,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.glastonburyabbey.com/joseph-of-arimathea.php &quot;Joseph of Arimathea&quot;, Glastonbury Abbey]&lt;/ref&gt; and also with the [[Holy Grail]] legend.

==Gospel narratives==
{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:57}} described him simply as a rich man and disciple of Jesus, but according to {{bibleref2|Mark|15:43}} Joseph of Arimathea was &quot;a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God&quot;; and {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:50–56}} adds that he &quot;had not consented to their decision and action&quot;.

According to {{bibleref2|John|19:38}}, upon hearing of Jesus' death, this secret [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] of Jesus &quot;asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission.&quot; Joseph immediately purchased a linen shroud ({{bibleref2|Mark| 15:46}}) and proceeded to [[Calvary|Golgotha]] to take the body of Jesus down from the cross. There, according to {{bibleref2|John| 19:39-40}}, Joseph and [[Nicodemus]] took the body and bound it in linen cloths with the spices that Nicodemus had bought. The disciples then conveyed the prepared corpse to a man-made cave hewn from rock in a garden of his house nearby. The Gospel of Matthew alone suggests that this was Joseph's own tomb ({{bibleref2|Matthew| 27:60}}). The burial was undertaken speedily, &quot;for the Sabbath was drawing on&quot;.

==Veneration==
[[File:Pietro Perugino 012.jpg|thumb|Joseph of Arimathea by [[Pietro Perugino]], a detail from his ''[[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Pietro Perugino)|Lamentation over the Dead Christ]].'']]

Joseph of Arimathea is venerated as a [[saint]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and some [[Protestant]] churches. The traditional Roman calendar marked his feast day on 17 March, but he is now listed, along with Saint [[Nicodemus]], on 31 August in the [[Roman Martyrology|Martyrologium Romanum]]. Eastern Orthodox churches commemorate him on the ''Third Sunday of [[Easter|Pascha]]'' (i.e., the second Sunday after Easter) and on 31 July, the date shared by [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnaman|first=Scott A.|title=Lutheranism 101|year=2010|publisher=[[Concordia Publishing House]]|location=St. Louis, Missouri|isbn=978-0-7586-2505-2|pages=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a series of legends developed during the [[Middle Ages]] (perhaps elaborations of early [[New Testament apocrypha]]) tied this Joseph to [[Great Britain|Britain]] as well as the Holy Grail, he is not currently on the abbreviated liturgical calendar of the Church of England, although this Joseph is on the calendars of some churches of the [[Anglican communion]], such as the [[Episcopal Church (USA)|Episcopal Church]], which commemorates him on 1 August.

==Old Testament prophecy==
[[File:5267-20080122-jerusalem-tomb-of-jesus.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Jesus in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]]]

Many Christians&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Ben Witherington III]], ''John's Wisdom: A Commentary on the Fourth Gospel'', 1995, and [[Andreas J. Köstenberger]] in ''[[Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament]]'', 2007, on John 19:38–42.&lt;/ref&gt; interpret Joseph's role as fulfilling [[Isaiah]]'s prediction that the grave of the &quot;Suffering Servant&quot; would be with a rich man ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 53:9), assuming that Isaiah was referring to the [[Messiah]]. The prophecy in [[Isaiah 53|Isaiah chapter 53]] is known as the &quot;[[Man of Sorrows]]&quot; passage:

{{bq|1=He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.}}

The Greek [[Septuagint]] text:

{{bq|1=And I will give the wicked for his burial, and the rich for his death; for he practiced no iniquity, nor craft with his mouth.}}

==Development of legends==
{{Gospel Jesus}}
Since the 2nd century, a mass of legendary detail has accumulated around the figure of Joseph of Arimathea in addition to the New Testament references. Joseph is referenced in apocryphal and non-canonical accounts such as the ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', a text often appended to the medieval ''Gospel of Nicodemus'' and ''The Narrative of Joseph'', and mentioned in the works of  [[Early Christianity|early church]] historians such as [[Irenaeus]] (125–189), [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] (170–236), [[Tertullian]] (155–222) and [[Eusebius]] (260–340), who added details not found in the canonical accounts. [[Francis Gigot]], writing in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', states that &quot;the additional details which are found concerning him in the apocryphal ''Acta Pilati'' (&quot;Acts of Pilate&quot;), are unworthy of credence.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gigot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08520a.htm|title=Joseph of Arimathea|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia|volume=8|location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |year=1910 |accessdate=13 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilary of Poitiers]] (300–367) enriched the legend, and Saint [[John Chrysostom]] (347–407), the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], was the first to write&lt;ref&gt;John Chrysostom, ''Homilies of St. John Chrysostom on the Gospel of John''.&lt;/ref&gt; that Joseph was one of the [[Seventy Apostles]] appointed in Luke 10.

During the late 12th century, Joseph became connected with the [[Arthurian cycle]], appearing in them as the first keeper of the [[Holy Grail]]. This idea first appears in [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''Joseph d'Arimathie'', in which Joseph receives the Grail from an apparition of Jesus and sends it with his followers to Britain. This theme is elaborated upon in Boron's sequels and in subsequent Arthurian works penned by others. Later retellings of the story contend that Joseph of Arimathea himself travelled to Britain and became the first Christian bishop in the Isles, a claim Gigot characterizes as a fable.&lt;ref name=Gigot/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finally, the story of the translation of the body of Joseph of Arimathea from Jerusalem to Moyenmonstre (Diocese of Toul) originated late and is unreliable.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gospel of Nicodemus===
The ''[[Gospel of Nicodemus]]'', a text appended to the ''Acts of Pilate'', provides additional details about Joseph. For instance, after Joseph asked Pilate for the body of the Christ, and prepared the body with Nicodemus' help, Christ's body was delivered to a new tomb that Joseph had built for himself. In the ''Gospel of Nicodemus'', the Jewish elders express anger at Joseph for burying the body of Christ, saying:

{{bq|1=And likewise Joseph also stepped out and said to them: Why are you angry against me because I begged the body of Jesus? Behold, I have put him in my new tomb, wrapping in clean linen; and I have rolled a stone to the door of the tomb.  And you have acted not well against the just man, because you have not repented of crucifying him, but also have pierced him with a spear.|sign=''Gospel of Nicodemus''. Translated by Alexander Walker.}}
The Jewish elders then captured Joseph, and imprisoned him, and placed a seal on the door to his cell after first posting a guard. Joseph warned the elders, &quot;The Son of God whom you hanged upon the cross, is able to deliver me out of your hands.  All your wickedness will return upon you.&quot;

Once the elders returned to the cell, the seal was still in place, but Joseph was gone.  The elders later discover that Joseph had returned to Arimathea.  Having a change in heart, the elders desired to have a more civil conversation with Joseph about his actions and sent a letter of apology to him by means of seven of his friends.  Joseph travelled back from Arimathea to Jerusalem to meet with the elders, where they questioned him about his escape.  He told them this story;&lt;br&gt;
{{bq|1=On the day of the Preparation, about the tenth hour, you shut me in, and I remained there the whole Sabbath in full. And when midnight came, as I was standing and praying, the house where you shut me in was hung up by the four corners, and there was a flashing of light in mine eyes. And I fell to the ground trembling. Then some one lifted me up from the place where I had fallen, and poured over me an abundance of water from the head even to the feet, and put round my nostrils the odour of a  wonderful ointment, and rubbed my face with the water itself, as if washing me, and kissed me, and said to me, Joseph, fear not; but open thine eyes, and see who it is that speaks to thee. And looking, I saw Jesus; and being terrified, I thought it was a phantom. And with prayer and the commandments I spoke to him, and he spoke with me. And I said to him: Art thou Rabbi Elias? And he said to me: I am not Elias. And I said: Who art thou, my Lord? And he said to me: I am Jesus, whose body thou didst beg from Pilate, and wrap in clean linen; and thou didst lay a napkin on my face, and didst lay me in thy new tomb, and roll a stone to the door of the tomb. Then I said to him that was speaking to me: Show me, Lord, where I laid thee. And he led me, and showed me the place where I laid him, and the linen which I had put on him, and the napkin which I had wrapped upon his face; and I knew that it was Jesus. And he took hold of me with his hand, and put me in the midst of my house though the gates were shut, and put me in my bed, and said to me: Peace to thee! And he kissed me, and said to me: For forty days go not out of thy house; for, lo, I go to my brethren into Galilee.|sign=''Gospel of Nicodemus''. Translated by Alexander Walker}}

According to the ''Gospel of Nicodemus'', Joseph testified to the Jewish elders, and specifically to chief priests [[Caiaphas]] and [[Annas]] that Jesus had risen from the dead and ascended to heaven and he indicated that others were raised from the dead at the resurrection of Christ (repeating [[Matthew 27:52|Matt 27:52]]–[[Matthew 27:53|53]]). He specifically identified the two sons of the high-priest Simeon (again in Luke 2:25–35). The elders Annas, Caiaphas, Nicodemus, and Joseph himself, along with [[Gamaliel]] under whom [[Paul of Tarsus]] studied, travelled to Arimathea to interview Simeon's sons Charinus and Lenthius.

==Other medieval texts==
Medieval interest in Joseph centered on two themes, that of Joseph as the founder of [[Celtic Christianity|British Christianity]] (even before it had taken hold in Rome), and that of Joseph as the original guardian of the Holy Grail.

===Britain===
{{See also|Early centers of Christianity#Roman Britain}}
[[File:2nd state - c1809.jpg|thumb|[[William Blake]]'s Illustration ''Joseph of Arimathea Among the Rocks of Albion'' in its second state after Blake's 1773 original, engraved circa 1809]]
Legends about the arrival of Christianity in Britain abounded during the Middle Ages. Early writers do not connect Joseph to this activity, however. [[Tertullian]] (AD 155–222) wrote in ''Adversus Judaeos'' that Britain had already received and accepted the Gospel in his lifetime, writing, &quot;all the limits of the Spains, and the diverse nations of the Gauls, and the haunts of the Britons—inaccessible to the Romans, but subjugated to Christ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf03/anf03-19.htm#P2021_691723|title=Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. III : An Answer to the Jews.|website=www.tertullian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian does not say how the Gospel came to Britain before AD 222. However, [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], (AD 260–340), one of the earliest and most comprehensive of church historians, wrote of Christ's disciples in ''Demonstratio Evangelica,'' saying that &quot;some have crossed the Ocean and reached the Isles of Britain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_de_05_book3.htm|title=Eusebius of Caesarea: Demonstratio Evangelica. Tr. W.J. Ferrar (1920) -- Book 3|website=www.tertullian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint [[Hilary of Poitiers]] (AD 300–376) also wrote that the Apostles had built churches and that the Gospel had passed into Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf209.toc.html|title=NPNF2-09. Hilary of Poitiers, John of Damascus - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writings of Pseudo-[[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] include a list of the [[seventy disciples]] whom Jesus sent forth in Luke 10, one of which is [[Aristobulus of Britannia|Aristobulus]] of Romans 16:10, called &quot;bishop of Britain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0524.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: On the Apostles and Disciples (Pseudo-Hippolytus)|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In none of these earliest references to Christianity's arrival in Britain is Joseph of Arimathea mentioned. [[William of Malmesbury]]'s ''De Antiquitate Glastoniensis Ecclesiae'' (&quot;On the Antiquity of the [[Glastonbury Abbey|Church of Glastonbury]]&quot;, circa 1125) has not survived in its original edition, and the stories involving Joseph of Arimathea are contained in subsequent editions that abound in interpolations placed by the Glastonbury monks &quot;in order to increase the Abbey's prestige&amp;nbsp;– and thus its pilgrim trade and prosperity&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[Antonia Gransden]], ''Historical Writing in England II, c. 1307 to the Present'', page 399. Routledge, 1996; Reprinted 2000. {{ISBN|0-415-15125-2}}. Antonia Grandsen also cited [[William Wells Newell]], &quot;William of Malmesbury on the Antiquity of Glastonbury&quot; in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', xviii (1903), pages 459–512; A. Gransden, &quot;The Growth of the Glastonbury Traditions and Legends in the Twelfth Century&quot; in ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'', xxvii (1976), page 342&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Gesta Regum Anglorum'' (''History of The Kings of England'', finished in 1125), William of Malmesbury wrote that Glastonbury Abbey was built by preachers sent by [[Pope Eleuterus]] to Britain, however also adding: &quot;Moreover there are documents of no small credit, which have been discovered in certain places to the following effect: 'No other hands than those of the disciples of Christ erected the church of Glastonbury';&quot; but here William did not explicitly link Glastonbury with Joseph of Arimathea, but instead emphasizes the possible role of [[Philip the Apostle]]: &quot;if Philip, the Apostle, preached to the Gauls, as Freculphus relates in the fourth chapter of his second book, it may be believed that he also planted the word on this side of the channel also.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;William of Malmesbury, ''William of Malmesbury's Chronicle of the Kings of England: From the Earliest Period To The Reign of King Stephen'', page 22 (notes and illustrations by J. A. Giles, London: Bell &amp; Daldy, 1866)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Komuso Buddhist monk beggar Kita-kamakura.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''[[komusō]]'' monk is one of many possible disguises]]

=== Disguises ===
The use of disguises is common and well documented. Disguises came in the form of priests, entertainers, fortune tellers, merchants, ''[[rōnin]]'', and monks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowdy 2006 51&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowdy|2006|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Buke Myōmokushō'' states,

{{quote|''Shinobi-monomi'' were people used in secret ways, and their duties were to go into the mountains and disguise themselves as firewood gatherers to discover and acquire the news about an enemy's territory... they were particularly expert at travelling in disguise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 27&quot; /&gt;}}

A mountain ascetic (''[[yamabushi]]'') attire facilitated travel, as they were common and could travel freely between political boundaries. The loose robes of Buddhist priests also allowed concealed weapons, such as the ''[[tantō]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deal 2007 161&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minstrel]] or ''[[sarugaku]]'' outfits could have allowed the ninja to spy in enemy buildings without rousing suspicion. Disguises as a ''[[komusō]]'', a mendicant monk known for playing the ''[[shakuhachi]]'', were also effective, as the large &quot;basket&quot; hats traditionally worn by them concealed the head completely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 18&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment ==
Ninja utilized a large variety of tools and weaponry, some of which were commonly known, but others were more specialized. Most were tools used in the infiltration of castles. A wide range of specialized equipment is described and illustrated in the 17th-century ''[[Bansenshukai]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 19&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; including climbing equipment, extending spears,&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 48&quot; /&gt; [[rocket]]-propelled arrows,&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 60&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and small collapsible boats.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger smith 1981 128&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Draeger|Smith|1981|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outerwear ===
[[File:Kuro-Shozoku-Ninja-Costume-at-Iga-Ninja-Museum.png|thumb|Kuro shozoku ninja costume and waraji (sandals). The image of the ninja costume being black is strong. However, in reality, ninjas wore navy blue-dyed farmers' working clothes, which were also believed to repel vipers.]]
[[File:Gappa travel cape and zunin with kusari armor.jpg|thumb|upright|Antique Japanese ''gappa'' (travel cape) and cloth ''zukin'' (hood) with ''kusari'' (chain armour) concealed underneath]]

While the image of a ninja clad in black garb (''[[shinobi shōzoku]]'') is prevalent in popular media, there is no written evidence for such attire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 16&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it was much more common for the ninja to be disguised as civilians. The popular notion of black clothing is likely rooted in artistic convention; early drawings of ninja showed them dressed in black in order to portray a sense of invisibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=17}}; Turnbull uses the name ''Buke Meimokushō'', an alternate reading for the same title. The ''Buke Myōmokushō'' cited here is a much more common reading.&lt;/ref&gt; This convention was an idea borrowed from the puppet handlers of ''[[bunraku]]'' theater, who dressed in total black in an effort to simulate [[Theatrical property|props]] moving independently of their controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howell 1999 211&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Howell|1999|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of hard evidence, it has been put forward by some authorities that black robes, perhaps slightly tainted with red to hide bloodstains, was indeed the sensible garment of choice for infiltration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 17&quot; /&gt;

Clothing used was similar to that of the [[samurai]], but loose garments (such as leggings) were tucked into trousers or secured with belts. The ''[[tenugui]]'', a piece of cloth also used in martial arts, had many functions. It could be used to cover the face, form a belt, or assist in climbing.

The historicity of armor specifically made for ninja cannot be ascertained. While pieces of light armor purportedly worn by ninja exist and date to the right time, there is no hard evidence of their use in ninja operations. Depictions of famous persons later deemed ninja often show them in [[Japanese armour|samurai armor]]. There were lightweight concealable types of armour made with [[Kusari (Japanese mail armour)|''kusari'']] (chain armour) and small armor plates such as [[Karuta (Japanese armour)|''karuta'']] that could have been worn by ninja including ''katabira'' (jackets) made with armour hidden between layers of cloth. Shin and arm guards, along with metal-reinforced hoods are also speculated to make up the ninja's armor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 17&quot; /&gt;

=== Tools ===
[[File:Ninpiden kuroro kagi breaker.gif|thumb|left|180px|A page from the ''[[Ninpiden]]'', showing a tool for breaking locks]]

Tools used for infiltration and espionage are some of the most abundant artifacts related to the ninja. Ropes and [[grappling hook]]s were common, and were tied to the belt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 19&quot; /&gt; A collapsible ladder is illustrated in the ''Bansenshukai'', featuring spikes at both ends to anchor the ladder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 20&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiked or hooked climbing gear worn on the hands and feet also doubled as weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mol 2003 121&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other implements include [[chisel]]s, [[hammer]]s, [[drill]]s, [[pickaxe|picks]] and so forth.

The ''[[kunai]]'' was a heavy pointed tool, possibly derived from the Japanese [[masonry]] [[trowel]], which it closely resembles. Although it is often portrayed in popular culture as a weapon, the ''kunai'' was primarily used for gouging holes in walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 61&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knives and small saws (''hamagari'') were also used to create holes in buildings, where they served as a foothold or a passage of entry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 20 21&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portable listening device (''saoto hikigane'') was used to eavesdrop on conversations and detect sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 21&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[mizugumo]]'' was a set of wooden shoes supposedly allowing the ninja to walk on water.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger smith 1981 128&quot; /&gt; They were meant to work by distributing the wearer's weight over the shoes' wide bottom surface. The word ''mizugumo'' is derived from the native name for the [[Japanese water spider]] (''Argyroneta aquatica japonica''). The ''mizugumo'' was featured on the show ''[[MythBusters]]'', where it was demonstrated unfit for walking on water. The ''ukidari'', a similar footwear for walking on water, also existed in the form of a flat round [[bucket]], but was probably quite unstable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 62&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inflatable skins and breathing tubes allowed the ninja to stay underwater for longer periods of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratti 1991 329&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the large array of tools available to the ninja, the ''Bansenshukai'' warns one not to be overburdened with equipment, stating &quot;a successful ninja is one who uses but one tool for multiple tasks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2001 359&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|2001|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weaponry ===
Although shorter swords and daggers were used, the ''[[katana]]'' was probably the ninja's weapon of choice, and was sometimes carried on the back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 18&quot; /&gt; The katana had several uses beyond normal combat. In dark places, the scabbard could be extended out of the sword, and used as a long probing device.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1970 52&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sword could also be laid against the wall, where the ninja could use the sword guard (''[[tsuba]]'') to gain a higher foothold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1970 49&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The katana could even be used as a device to stun enemies before attacking them, by putting a combination of red pepper, dirt or dust, and iron filings into the area near the top of the scabbard, so that as the sword was drawn the concoction would fly into the enemy's eyes, stunning him until a lethal blow could be made. While straight swords were used before the invention of the katana,&lt;ref name=&quot;Reed 1880 269 270&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1880|pp=269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; the straight ''[[ninjatō]]'' has no historical precedent and is likely a modern invention.

[[File:Kusarigama-crop.jpg|thumb|A pair of ''[[kusarigama]]'', on display in [[Iwakuni Castle]]]]

An array of [[Dart (missile)|darts]], spikes, knives, and sharp, star-shaped discs were known collectively as ''[[shuriken]]''. While not exclusive to the ninja,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mol 2003 119&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were an important part of the arsenal, where they could be thrown in any direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratti 1991 328 329&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|pp=328–329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bows were used for sharpshooting, and some ninjas' bows were intentionally made smaller than the traditional ''[[yumi]]'' (longbow).&lt;ref name=&quot;ratti 1991 328&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chain and sickle (''[[kusarigama]]'') was also used by the ninja.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1970 55&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This weapon consisted of a weight on one end of a chain, and a sickle (''[[Kama (weapon)|kama]]'') on the other. The weight was swung to injure or disable an opponent, and the sickle used to kill at close range. 

Explosives introduced from [[China]] were known in Japan by the time of the [[Mongol Invasions of Japan|Mongol Invasions]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunch Hellemans2004 161&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunch|Hellemans|2004|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, explosives such as hand-held bombs and grenades were adopted by the ninja.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratti 1991 329&quot; /&gt; Soft-cased bombs were designed to release smoke or poison gas, along with fragmentation explosives packed with iron or ceramic [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 22&quot; /&gt;

Along with common weapons, a large assortment of miscellaneous arms were associated with the ninja. Some examples include poison,&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 19&quot; /&gt; ''[[makibishi]]'' (caltrops),&lt;ref name=&quot;Mol 2003 176&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; cane swords (''[[shikomizue]]''),&lt;ref name=&quot;Mol 2003 195&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; land mines,&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger smith 1981 127&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Draeger|Smith|1981|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[fukiya]]'' (blowguns), poisoned darts, [[acid]]-spurting tubes, and firearms.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratti 1991 329&quot; /&gt; The ''happō'', a small eggshell filled with blinding powder (''[[metsubushi]]''), was also used to facilitate escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mol 2003 124&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legendary abilities ==
[[Superhuman]] or [[supernatural]] powers were often associated with the ninja. Some legends include [[flight]], [[invisibility]], [[shapeshifting]], the ability to &quot;split&quot; into multiple bodies (''bunshin''), the summoning of animals (''kuchiyose''), and control over the [[Five elements (Japanese philosophy)|five classical elements]]. These fabulous notions have stemmed from popular imagination regarding the ninja's mysterious status, as well as romantic ideas found in later Japanese art of the [[Edo period]]. Magical powers were sometimes rooted in the ninja's own efforts to disseminate fanciful information. For example, Nakagawa Shoshunjin, the 17th-century founder of Nakagawa-ryū, claimed in his own writings (''Okufuji Monogatari'') that he had the ability to transform into birds and animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 13&quot; /&gt;

Perceived control over the elements may be grounded in real tactics, which were categorized by association with forces of nature. For example, the practice of starting fires in order to cover a ninja's trail falls under ''katon-no-jutsu'' (&quot;fire techniques&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mol 2003 176&quot; /&gt;

The ninja's adaption of [[kite]]s in espionage and warfare is another subject of legends. Accounts exist of ninja being lifted into the air by kites, where they flew over hostile terrain and descended into, or dropped bombs on enemy territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger smith 1981 128&quot; /&gt; Kites were indeed used in Japanese warfare, but mostly for the purpose of sending messages and relaying signals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckley 2002 257&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckley|2002|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turnbull suggests that kites lifting a man into midair might have been technically feasible, but states that the use of kites to form a human &quot;[[Hang gliding|hang glider]]&quot; falls squarely in the realm of fantasy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 22 23&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kuji-kiri ===
''[[Kuji-kiri]]'' is an esoteric practice which, when performed with an array of hand &quot;seals&quot; (''[[kuji-in]]''), was meant to allow the ninja to enact superhuman feats.

The ''kuji'' (&quot;nine characters&quot;) is a concept originating from [[Daoism]], where it was a string of nine words used in charms and incantations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterhouse 1996 2 3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waterhouse|1996|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[China]], this tradition mixed with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] beliefs, assigning each of the nine words to a Buddhist deity. The ''kuji'' may have arrived in Japan via Buddhism,&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterhouse 1996 8 11&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waterhouse|1996|pp=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it flourished within [[Shugendō]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterhouse 1996 13&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waterhouse|1996|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here too, each word in the ''kuji'' was associated with Buddhist deities, animals from Taoist mythology, and later, Shinto [[kami]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterhouse 1996 24 27&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waterhouse|1996|pp=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[mudrā]]'', a series of hand symbols representing different Buddhas, was applied to the ''kuji'' by Buddhists, possibly through the esoteric ''[[Mikkyō]]'' teachings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterhouse 1996 24 25&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waterhouse|1996|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[yamabushi]]'' ascetics of Shugendō adopted this practice, using the hand gestures in spiritual, healing, and [[exorcism]] rituals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teeuwen Rambelli 2002 327&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Teeuwen|Rambelli|2002|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the use of ''kuji'' passed onto certain ''[[bujutsu]]'' (martial arts) and ''[[ninjutsu]]'' schools, where it was said to have many purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterhouse 1996 31 33&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waterhouse|1996|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of ''kuji'' to produce a desired effect was called &quot;cutting&quot; (''kiri'') the ''kuji''. Intended effects range from physical and mental concentration, to more incredible claims about rendering an opponent immobile, or even the casting of magical spells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1970 29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=29}}; {{Harvnb|Waterhouse|1996|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These legends were captured in popular culture, which interpreted the ''kuji-kiri'' as a precursor to magical acts.

== Famous people ==
Many famous people in Japanese history have been associated or identified as ninja, but their status as ninja are difficult to prove and may be the product of later imagination. Rumors surrounding famous warriors, such as [[Kusunoki Masashige]] or [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]] sometimes describe them as ninja, but there is little evidence for these claims. 

Some well known examples include:
* [[Hino Kumawaka|Kumawakamaru]] (13th–14th centuries): A youth whose exiled father was ordered to death by the monk Homma Saburō. Kumakawa took his revenge by sneaking into Homma's room while he was asleep, and assassinating him with his own sword.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCullough 2004 48&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|McCullough|2004|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was son of a high counselor to [[Emperor Go-Daigo]], not ninja.

* [[Yagyū Munetoshi]] (1529–1606): A renowned swordsman of the [[Shinkage-ryū]] school. Muneyoshi's grandson, Jubei Muneyoshi, told tales of his grandfather's status as a ninja.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 29&quot; /&gt;
* [[Hattori Hanzō]] (1542–1596): A samurai serving under [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. His ancestry in Iga province, along with ''[[ninjutsu]]'' manuals published by his descendants have led some sources to define him as a ninja.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1970 34&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This depiction is also common in popular culture.
* [[Ishikawa Goemon]] (1558–1594): Goemon reputedly tried to drip poison from a thread into [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s mouth through a hiding spot in the ceiling,&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1970 160&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many fanciful tales exist about Goemon, and this story cannot be confirmed.
* [[Fūma Kotarō]] (d. 1603): A ninja rumored to have killed Hattori Hanzō, with whom he was supposedly rivals. The fictional weapon ''[[Fūma shuriken]]'' is named after him.
* [[Mochizuki Chiyome]] (16th century): The wife of Mochizuke Moritoki. Chiyome created a school for girls, which taught skills required of [[geisha]], as well as espionage skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2001 671&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|2001|p=671}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Momochi Sandayū (16th century): A leader of the Iga ninja clans, who supposedly perished during Oda Nobunaga's attack on Iga province. There is some belief that he escaped death and lived as a farmer in [[Kii Province]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1970 42&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Momochi is also a branch of the Hattori clan.
* Fujibayashi Nagato (16th century): Considered to be one of three &quot;greatest&quot; Iga ''jōnin'', the other two being Hattori Hanzō and Momochi Sandayū. Fujibayashi's descendants wrote and edited the ''Bansenshukai''.
* [[Katō Danzō]] (1503 – 1569): A famed 16th-century ninja master during the Sengoku period who was also known as &quot;Flying Katō&quot;.
* [[Tateoka Doshun]] (16th century): An intermediate-ranking Iga ninja during the Sengoku period.
* [[Karasawa Genba]] (16th century): A samurai of the Sengoku period, in the 16th century of the common era, who served as an important retainer of the Sanada clan.

The image of the ninja entered popular culture in the [[Edo period]], when [[Japanese folklore|folktales]] and plays about ninja were conceived. Stories about the ninja are usually based on historical figures. For instance, many similar tales exist about a ''daimyō'' challenging a ninja to prove his worth, usually by stealing his pillow or weapon while he slept.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 14&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novels were written about the ninja, such as ''[[Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari]]'', which was also made into a [[kabuki]] play. Fictional figures such as [[Sarutobi Sasuke]] would eventually make their way into comics and television, where they have come to enjoy a [[culture hero]] status outside their original mediums.

Ninja appear in many forms of Japanese and Western popular media, including books (''[[The Kouga Ninja Scrolls|Kōga Ninpōchō]]''), television (''[[Sasuke (TV series)|Ninja Warrior]]''), animation (''[[Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu (TV series)|Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu]]''), movies (''[[Ninja Assassin]]''), [[video games]] (''[[Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice]]'', ''[[Tenchu]]'', ''[[Shinobi (video game)|Shinobi]]''), [[anime]] (''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Ninja Scroll]]''), [[manga]] (''[[Basilisk (manga)|Basilisk]]'') and American [[comic book]]s (''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''). From ancient Japan to the modern world media, popular depictions range from the realistic to the fantastically exaggerated, both fundamentally and aesthetically.

As a consequence, until 1984 the blessing of rosaries came to be reserved to Dominicans or priests having special faculties. Besides the Dominican rosary, there are various other forms. The [[Servite rosary]], for instance, has seven sections in memory of the Seven Sorrows of the BVM (Blessed Virgin Mary), each consisting of the Lord's Prayer and seven Hail Marys; it apparently dates from the 17th cent...|last1= Cross|first1= Frank Leslie|accessdate= 29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Casanowicz1919&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Casanowicz |first= Immanuel Moses |title= Ecclesiastical Art in the United States National Museum |url= https://archive.org/details/descriptivecatal00casa_0 |accessdate= 29 April 2014 |year= 1919 |publisher= U.S. Government Printing Office |pages= [https://archive.org/details/descriptivecatal00casa_0/page/632 632] |quote= ''Rosary''.

The full or greater Dominican rosary of 15 decades.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply the '''Rosary''', refers to a set of [[prayers]] used in the [[Catholic Church]] and to the string of knots or beads used to count the component prayers. When referring to the prayer, the word is usually capitalized (&quot;the Rosary&quot;, as is customary for other names of prayers, such as &quot;the [[Lord's Prayer]]&quot;, and &quot;the [[Hail Mary]]&quot;); when referring to the beads, it is written with a lower-case initial letter (&quot;a rosary bead&quot;).

The prayers that compose the Rosary are arranged in sets of ten Hail Marys, called decades. Each decade is preceded by one Lord's Prayer (&quot;Our Father&quot;) and traditionally followed by only one [[Glory Be]]. Many Catholics also choose to recite the &quot;O my Jesus&quot; prayer after the Glory Be, which is the most well-known of the seven [[Fatima Prayers]]. During recitation of each set, thought is given to one of the [[#Mysteries of the Rosary|Mysteries of the Rosary]], which recall events in the lives of [[Jesus]] and of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]]. Five decades are recited per rosary. Rosary [[prayer beads|beads]] are an aid towards saying these prayers in the proper sequence.

[[Pope Pius V]] (in office 1566–1572) established a standard 15 Mysteries of the Rosary, based on long-standing custom. This groups the mysteries in three sets: the Joyful Mysteries, the Sorrowful Mysteries, and the Glorious Mysteries. In 2002 [[Pope John Paul II]] said that it is fitting that a new set of five be added, termed the Luminous Mysteries, bringing the total number of mysteries to 20. The Glorious mysteries are prayed on Sunday and Wednesday, the Joyful on Monday and Saturday, the Sorrowful on Tuesday and Friday, and the Luminous on Thursday. Usually five decades are recited in a session.

Over more than four centuries, several popes have promoted the Rosary as part of the [[veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy, 197] The Rosary, or Psalter of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is one of the most excellent prayers to the Mother of God
*[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c4a1.htm#1674 Popular Piety] Besides sacramental liturgy and sacramentals, catechesis must take into account the forms of piety and popular devotions among the faithful. The religious sense of the Christian people has always found expression in various forms of piety concerning the Church's sacramental life, such as the veneration of relics, visits to sanctuaries, pilgrimages, processions, the stations of the cross, religious dances, the rosary, medals, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devotions and spirituality==
{{Main|Rosary devotions and spirituality}}

Devotion to the Rosary is one of the most notable features of popular Catholic [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alister E., ''Christian Spirituality: An Introduction,'' 1995 {{ISBN|0-631-21281-7}} p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] placed the Rosary at the very center of Christian spirituality and called it &quot;among the finest and most praiseworthy traditions of Christian contemplation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Madore, George. ''The Rosary with John Paul II,'' 2004, Alba House, {{ISBN|2-89420-545-7}} p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JPII/&gt;

Catholics believe the Rosary is a remedy against severe trials, temptations and the hardships of life, and that the Rosary is one of the great weapons given to believers in their battle against every evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stphiliptheapostle.com/rosaryapostolate.html|title=Rosary Apostolate|website=www.stphiliptheapostle.com|access-date=2019-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429064039/http://www.stphiliptheapostle.com/rosaryapostolate.html|archive-date=29 April 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

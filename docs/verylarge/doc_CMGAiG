'''Darius I''' ({{lang-peo|𐎭𐎠𐎼𐎹𐎺𐎢𐏁|translit=Dārayava(h)uš}}; [[New Persian]]: {{lang|fa|داریوش||translit=Dāryuš|rtl=yes}}; {{hebrew Name|דָּרְיָוֶשׁ|Darəyaveš|Dārǝyāweš}}; c. 550 – 486 BCE), commonly known as '''Darius the Great''', was the third [[List of kings of Persia|Persian]] [[King of Kings]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], reigning from 522 BCE until his death in 486 BCE. He ruled the empire at its peak, when it included much of [[West Asia]], parts of the [[Caucasus]], parts of the [[Balkans]] ([[Thrace]]-[[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]]), most of the [[Black Sea]] coastal regions, Central Asia, as far as the [[Achaemenid invasion of the Indus Valley|Indus Valley]] in the far east and portions of north and northeast Africa including [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|Egypt]] (Mudrâya), eastern [[ancient Libya|Libya]], and coastal [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dagestan|title=DĀḠESTĀN|access-date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=riW0kKzat2sC&amp;q=achaemenid+empire+abkhazia&amp;pg=PA409|title=The Making of the Georgian Nation|access-date=29 December 2014|isbn=978-0253209153|last1=Suny|first1=Ronald Grigor|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darius ascended the throne by overthrowing the legitimate Achaemenid monarch [[Bardiya]], whom he later fabricated to be an imposter named [[Gaumata]]. The new king met with rebellions throughout his kingdom and quelled them each time. A major event in Darius's life was his expedition to punish [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] for their aid in the [[Ionian Revolt]] and subjugate [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Although ultimately ending in failure at the [[Battle of Marathon]], Darius succeeded in the re-subjugation of [[Thrace]], expansion of the empire through the conquest of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], the [[Cyclades]] and the island of [[Naxos]] and the sacking of the city of Eretria.

Darius organized the empire by dividing it into provinces and placing [[satraps]] to govern it. He organized [[Achaemenid coinage]] as a new uniform monetary system, along with making [[Official Aramaic language|Aramaic]] the official language of the empire. He also put the empire in better standing by building roads and introducing standard weights and measures. Through these changes, the empire was centralized and unified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together, Worlds Apart concise edition vol.1|last = Pollard|first = Elizabeth|publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-393-25093-0|location = New York|pages = 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darius also worked on construction projects throughout the empire, focusing on [[Susa]], [[Pasargadae]], [[Persepolis]], [[Babylon]], and [[Persian Egypt|Egypt]]. He had the cliff-face [[Behistun Inscription]] carved to record his conquests, an important testimony of the [[Old Persian language]].

Darius is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible|biblical books]] of [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]], [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]], and [[Ezra–Nehemiah]].

At some time between his [[coronation]] and his death, Darius left a tri-lingual monumental [[relief]] on [[Mount Behistun]], which was written in [[Elamite]], [[Old Persian]] and [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]]. The inscription begins with a brief autobiography including his [[ancestry]] and [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. To aid the presentation of his ancestry, Darius wrote down the sequence of events that occurred after the death of [[Cyrus the Great]].{{sfn|Duncker|1882|p=192}}{{sfn|Egerton|1994|p=6}} Darius mentions several times that he is the rightful king by the grace of the supreme deity [[Ahura Mazda]].

[[Herodotus]], a Greek historian and author of ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', provided an account of many [[Persian people#Ancient history and origin|Persian]] kings and the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He wrote extensively on Darius, spanning half of Book 3 along with Books 4, 5 and 6.

Darius was the eldest of five sons to [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]].{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} The identity of his mother is uncertain. According to the modern historian [[Alireza Shapour Shahbazi]] (1994), Darius' mother was a certain Rhodogune.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} However, according to Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones (2013), recently uncovered texts in Persepolis indicates that his mother was [[Irdabama]], an affluent landowner descended from a family of local Elamite rulers.{{sfn|Llewellyn-Jones|2013|p=112}} Richard Stoneman likewise refers Irdabama to as the mother of Darius.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=189}} The [[Behistun Inscription]] of Darius states that his father was [[satrap]] of [[Bactria]] in 522 BCE.{{efn|According to [[Herodotus]], Hystaspes was the satrap of [[Fars Province#Persis|Persis]], although the French [[Iranologist]] [[Pierre Briant]] states that this is an error.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=467}} Richard Stoneman likewise considers Herodotus' account to be incorrect.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=20}}}} According to Herodotus (III.139), Darius, prior to seizing power and &quot;of no consequence at the time&quot;, had served as a spearman (''doryphoros'') in the Egyptian campaign (528–525 BCE) of [[Cambyses II]], then the Persian Great King;{{sfn|Cook|1985|p=217}} this is often interpreted to mean he was the king's personal spear-carrier, an important role. Hystaspes was an officer in [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]' army and a noble of his court.{{sfn|Abbott|2009|p=14}}

Before Cyrus and his army crossed the [[Aras River]] to battle with the Armenians, he installed his son [[Cambyses II]] as king in case he should not return from battle.{{sfn|Abbott|2009|p=14–15}} However, once Cyrus had crossed the Aras River, he had a vision in which Darius had wings atop his shoulders and stood upon the confines of Europe and Asia (the known world). When Cyrus awoke from the dream, he inferred it as a great danger to the future security of the empire, as it meant that Darius would one day rule the whole world. However, his son Cambyses was the heir to the throne, not Darius, causing Cyrus to wonder if Darius was forming treasonable and ambitious designs. This led Cyrus to order Hystaspes to go back to [[Persis]] and watch over his son strictly, until Cyrus himself returned.{{sfn|Abbott|2009|p=15–16}} Darius did not seem to have any treasonous thoughts as Cambyses II ascended the throne peacefully; and, through promotion, Darius was eventually elevated to be Cambyses's personal [[lancer]].

===Accession===
[[File:Lineage of Darius the Great.jpg|thumb|left|Lineage of Darius the Great according to the [[Behistun Inscription]].]]
There are different accounts of the rise of Darius to the throne from both Darius himself and Greek historians. The oldest records report a convoluted sequence of events in which Cambyses II lost his mind, murdered his brother [[Bardiya]], and was killed by an infected leg wound. After this, Darius and a group of six nobles traveled to Sikayauvati to kill an usurper, [[Gaumata]], who had taken the throne by pretending to be Bardiya during the true king's absence.

Darius's account, written at the Behistun Inscription, states that Cambyses II killed his own brother Bardiya, but that this murder was not known among the [[Iranian people]]. A would-be [[usurper]] named Gaumata came and lied to the people, stating he was Bardiya.{{sfn|Boardman|1988|p=54}} The Iranians had grown rebellious against Cambyses's rule and on 11 March 522 BCE a revolt against Cambyses broke out in his absence. On 1 July, the Iranian people chose to be under the leadership of Gaumata, as &quot;Bardiya&quot;. No member of the Achaemenid family would rise against Gaumata for the safety of their own life. Darius, who had served Cambyses as his lance-bearer until the deposed ruler's death, prayed for aid and in September 522 BCE, along with [[Otanes]], [[Intaphrenes]], [[Gobryas]], [[Hydarnes]], [[Megabyzus]] and [[Aspathines]], killed Gaumata in the fortress of Sikayauvati.{{sfn|Boardman|1988|p=54}}

Herodotus provides a dubious account of Darius's ascension: Several days after Gaumata had been assassinated, Darius and the other six nobles discussed the fate of the empire. At first, the seven discussed the form of government; a [[democratic republic]] (''[[Isonomia]]'') was strongly pushed by [[Otanes]], an [[oligarchy]] was pushed by Megabyzus, while Darius pushed for a monarchy. After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would be led with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was able to convince the other nobles.

To decide who would become the monarch, six of them decided on a test, with Otanes abstaining, as he had no interest in being king. They were to gather outside the palace, mounted on their horses at sunrise, and the man whose horse neighed first in recognition of the rising sun would become king. According to Herodotus, Darius had a slave, Oebares, who rubbed his hand over the genitals of a mare that Darius's horse favored. When the six gathered, Oebares placed his hands beside the nostrils of Darius' horse, who became excited at the scent and neighed. This was followed by lightning and thunder, leading the others to dismount and kneel before Darius in recognition of his apparent [[divine providence]].{{sfn|Poolos|2008|p=17}} In this account, Darius himself claimed that he achieved the throne not through fraud, but cunning, even erecting a statue of himself mounted on his neighing horse with the inscription: &quot;Darius, son of Hystaspes, obtained the sovereignty of Persia by the sagacity of his horse and the ingenious contrivance of Oebares, his groom.&quot;{{sfn|Abbott|2009|p=98}}

According to the accounts of Greek historians, Cambyses II had left [[Patizeithes]] in charge of the kingdom when he headed for Egypt. He later sent [[Prexaspes]] to murder Bardiya. After the killing, Patizeithes put his brother Gaumata, a [[Magian]] who resembled Bardiya, on the throne and declared him the Great King. Otanes discovered that Gaumata was an impostor, and along with six other Iranian nobles including Darius, created a plan to oust the pseudo-Bardiya. After killing the impostor along with his brother Patizeithes and other Magians, Darius was crowned king the following morning.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}

The details regarding Darius' rise to power is generally acknowledged as forgery and was in reality used as a concealment of his overthrow and murder of Cyrus' rightful successor, Bardiya.{{sfn|Llewellyn-Jones|2017|p=70}} To legitimize his rule, Darius had a common origin fabricated between himself and Cyrus by designating [[Achaemenes]] as the eponymous founder of their dynasty.{{sfn|Llewellyn-Jones|2017|p=70}} In reality, Darius was not from the same house as Cyrus and his forebears, the rulers of [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]].{{sfn|Llewellyn-Jones|2017|p=70}}{{sfn|Waters|1996|pp=11, 18}}

==Early reign==
===Early revolts===
Following his coronation at [[Pasargadae]], Darius moved to [[Ecbatana]]. He soon learned that support for [[Bardiya]] was strong, and revolts in [[Elam]] and [[Babylonia]] had broken out.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=115}} Darius ended the Elamite revolt when the revolutionary leader Aschina was captured and executed in [[Susa]]. After three months the revolt in Babylonia had ended. While in Babylonia, Darius learned a revolution had broken out in [[Bactria]], a [[satrapy]] which had always been in favour of Darius, and had initially volunteered an army of soldiers to quell revolts. Following this, revolts broke out in [[Persis]], the homeland of the Persians and Darius and then in Elam and Babylonia, followed by in [[Media (region)|Media]], [[Parthia]], [[Assyria]], and [[Egypt]].{{sfn|Briant|2002|pp=115–116}}

By 522 BCE, there were revolts against Darius in most parts of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] leaving the empire in turmoil. Even though Darius did not seem to have the support of the [[populace]], Darius had a loyal army, led by close confidants and nobles (including the six nobles who had helped him remove Gaumata). With their support, Darius was able to suppress and quell all revolts within a year. In Darius's words, he had killed a total of nine &quot;lying kings&quot; through the quelling of revolutions.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=116}} Darius left a detailed account of these revolutions in the [[Behistun Inscription]].{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=116}}

===Elimination of Intaphernes===
One of the significant events of Darius's early reign was the slaying of [[Intaphernes]], one of the seven noblemen who had deposed the previous ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=131}} The seven had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, except when he was with a woman.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=131}} One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius was with a woman.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=131}} Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=131}} While leaving the palace, he took the [[bridle]] from his horse, and tied the two officers together.

The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had done to them. Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings. Darius' choice to ask the noblemen indicates that he was not yet completely sure of his authority.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=131}}

Taking precautions against further resistance, Darius sent soldiers to seize Intaphernes, along with his son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphernes was planning a rebellion, but when he was brought to the court, there was no proof of any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphernes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so was that she could have another husband and another son, but she would always have but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life.{{sfn|Abbott|2009|p=99–101}}

===Egyptian campaign===
{{main|Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt}}
After securing his authority over the [[Achaemenid Empire|entire empire]], Darius embarked on a campaign to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] where he defeated the armies of the Pharaoh and secured the lands that Cambyses had conquered while incorporating a large portion of [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|Egypt into the Achaemenid Empire]].{{sfn|Del Testa|2001|p=47}}

Through another series of campaigns, Darius I would eventually reign over the territorial apex of the empire, when it stretched from parts of the [[Balkans]] ([[Thrace]]-[[Macedon]]ia, [[Bulgaria]]-[[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]]) in the west, to the [[Indus Valley]] in the east.

===Invasion of the Indus Valley===
[[File:Eastern border of the Achaemenid Empire.jpg|thumb|Eastern border of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]]]
{{Main|Achaemenid invasion of the Indus Valley}}
In 516 BCE, Darius embarked on a campaign to Central Asia, [[Ariana|Aria]] and [[Bactria]] and then marched into [[Afghanistan]] to [[Taxila (satrapy)|Taxila]] in modern-day [[Pakistan]]. Darius spent the winter of 516–515 BCE in [[Gandhara]], preparing to conquer the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]]. Darius conquered the lands surrounding the Indus River in 515 BCE. Darius I controlled the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]] from [[Gandhara]] to modern [[Karachi]] and appointed the Greek [[Scylax of Caryanda]] to explore the Indian Ocean from the mouth of the [[Indus]] to [[Suez]]. Darius then marched through the [[Bolan Pass]] and returned through [[Arachosia]] and [[Drangiana]] back to [[Persia]].

===Babylonian revolt===
After [[Bardiya]] was murdered, widespread revolts occurred throughout [[Achaemenid Empire|the empire]], especially on the eastern side. Darius asserted his position as king by force, taking his armies throughout the empire, suppressing each revolt individually. The most notable of all these revolts was the Babylonian revolt which was led by [[Nebuchadnezzar III]]. This revolt occurred when Otanes withdrew much of the army from [[Babylon]] to aid Darius in suppressing other revolts. Darius felt that the Babylonian people had taken advantage of him and deceived him, which resulted in Darius gathering a large army and marching to [[Babylon]]. At Babylon, Darius was met with closed gates and a series of defences to keep him and his armies out.{{sfn|Abbott|2009|p=129}}

Darius encountered mockery and taunting from the rebels, including the famous saying &quot;Oh yes, you will capture our city, when mules shall have foals.&quot; For a year and a half, Darius and his armies were unable to retake the city, though he attempted many tricks and strategies—even copying that which [[Cyrus the Great]] had employed when he captured Babylon. However, the situation changed in Darius's favour when, according to the story, a mule owned by [[Zopyrus]], a high-ranking soldier, foaled. Following this, a plan was hatched for [[Zopyrus]] to pretend to be a deserter, enter the Babylonian camp, and gain the trust of the Babylonians. The plan was successful and Darius's army eventually surrounded the city and overcame the rebels.{{sfn|Sélincourt|2002|p=234–235}}

During this revolt, [[Scythians|Scythian]] nomads took advantage of the disorder and chaos and invaded Persia. Darius first finished defeating the rebels in Elam, Assyria, and Babylon and then attacked the Scythian invaders. He pursued the invaders, who led him to a marsh; there he found no known enemies but an enigmatic Scythian tribe.{{sfn|Siliotti|2006|p=286–287}}

===European Scythian campaign===

One of the best preserved friezes, identical in content, is that of [[Xerxes I]].]]
{{main|European Scythian campaign of Darius I}}
The [[Scythians]] were a group of north Iranian nomadic tribes, speaking an [[Iranian language]] ([[Scythian languages]]) who had invaded [[Media (region)|Media]], killed [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] in battle, revolted against Darius and threatened to disrupt trade between Central Asia and the shores of the [[Black Sea]] as they lived between the [[Danube]] River, River [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and the Black Sea.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}{{sfn|Woolf|Maddocks|Balkwill|McCarthy|2004|p=686}}

Darius crossed the [[Black Sea]] at the [[Bosphorus]] Straits using a bridge of boats. Darius conquered large portions of Eastern Europe, even crossing the [[Danube]] to wage war on the [[Scythians]]. Darius invaded European [[Scythia]] in 513 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Miroslav Ivanov Vasilev. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rh2oBgAAQBAJ &quot;The Policy of Darius and Xerxes towards Thrace and Macedonia&quot;] {{ISBN|90-04-28215-7}} p 70&lt;/ref&gt; where the Scythians evaded Darius's army, using feints and retreating eastwards while laying waste to the countryside, by blocking wells, intercepting convoys, destroying pastures and continuous skirmishes against Darius's army.{{sfn|Ross|Wells|2004|p=291}} Seeking to fight with the Scythians, Darius's army chased the Scythian army deep into Scythian lands, where there were no cities to conquer and no supplies to forage. In frustration Darius sent a letter to the Scythian ruler [[Idanthyrsus]] to fight or surrender. The ruler replied that he would not stand and fight with Darius until they found the graves of their fathers and tried to destroy them. Until then, they would continue their strategy as they had no cities or cultivated lands to lose.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=68–69}}

Despite the evading tactics of the Scythians, Darius' campaign was so far relatively successful.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239–243}} As presented by [[Herodotus]], the tactics used by the Scythians resulted in the loss of their best lands and of damage to their loyal allies.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239–243}} This gave Darius the initiative.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239–243}} As he moved eastwards in the cultivated lands of the Scythians in Eastern Europe proper, he remained resupplied by his fleet and lived to an extent off the land.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239–243}} While moving eastwards in the European Scythian lands, he captured the large fortified city of the [[Budini]], one of the allies of the Scythians, and burnt it.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239–243}}

Darius eventually ordered a halt at the banks of Oarus, where he built &quot;eight great forts, some eight miles distant from each other&quot;, no doubt as a frontier defence.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239–243}} In his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', [[Herodotus]] states that the ruins of the forts were still standing in his day.{{sfn|Herodotus|2015|pp=352}} After chasing the Scythians for a month, Darius's army was suffering losses due to fatigue, privation and sickness. Concerned about losing more of his troops, Darius halted the march at the banks of the [[Volga River]] and headed towards [[Thrace]].{{sfn|Chaliand|2004|p=16}} He had conquered enough Scythian territory to force the Scythians to respect the Persian forces.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}{{sfn|Grousset|1970|pp=9–10}}

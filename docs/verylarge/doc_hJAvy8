==Second marriage==
By the time her marriage to Spencer was dissolved, Wallis had become involved with [[Ernest Aldrich Simpson]], an Anglo-American shipping executive and former officer in the [[Coldstream Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 68–70; Sebba, pp. 62–64; Vickers, pp. 267–269; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 125, 131&lt;/ref&gt; He divorced his first wife, Dorothea (by whom he had a daughter, Audrey), to marry Wallis on 21 July 1928 at the [[Register Office]] in [[Chelsea, London]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, pp. 62–67; Weir, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis had telegraphed her acceptance of his proposal from [[Cannes]] where she was staying with her friends, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The Simpsons temporarily set up home in a furnished house with four servants in [[Mayfair]].&lt;ref&gt;Duchess of Windsor, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Wallis sailed back to the United States to visit her sick mother, who had married legal clerk Charles Gordon Allen after the death of Rasin. During the trip, Wallis's investments were wiped out in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street Crash]], and her mother died penniless on 2 November 1929. Wallis returned to England and with the shipping business still buoyant,&lt;!--Pun intended!--&gt; the Simpsons moved into a large flat with a staff of servants.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Through a friend, Consuelo Thaw, Wallis met Consuelo's sister [[Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness|Thelma, Lady Furness]], at the time the mistress of Edward, Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 33; Sebba, p. 84; Vickers, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 January 1931, Lady Furness introduced Wallis to the Prince at [[Burrough Court]], near [[Melton Mowbray]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 37; King, p. 98; Vickers, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince was the eldest son of [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], and [[heir apparent]] to the British throne. Between 1931 and 1934, he met the Simpsons at various house parties, and Wallis was presented at court. Ernest was beginning to encounter financial difficulties, as the Simpsons were living beyond their means, and they had to fire a succession of staff.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 37–41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Edward, Prince of Wales==
[[File:Wallis Simpson and Prince 1935.jpg|thumb|250px|The Prince of Wales and Wallis in [[Kitzbühel]], Austria, February 1935]]

In January 1934, while Lady Furness was away in New York City, Wallis allegedly became the Prince's mistress.&lt;ref&gt;Edward sued one author, Geoffrey Dennis, who claimed that Wallis and Edward were lovers before their marriage, and won (King, p. 119).&lt;/ref&gt; Edward denied this to his father, despite his staff seeing them in bed together as well as &quot;evidence of a physical sexual act&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Diary of [[Clive Wigram, 1st Baron Wigram]] quoted in Bradford, pp. 145–147&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis soon ousted Lady Furness, and the Prince distanced himself from a former lover and confidante, the Anglo-American textile heiress [[Freda Dudley Ward]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 98; Vickers, p. 287; Ziegler, pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1934, Edward was irretrievably besotted with Wallis, finding her domineering manner and abrasive irreverence toward his position appealing; in the words of his official biographer, he became &quot;slavishly dependent&quot; on her.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot; /&gt; According to Wallis, it was during a cruise on [[Lord Moyne]]'s private yacht [[MY Rosaura|''Rosaura'']] in August 1934 that she fell in love with Edward.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 113; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 195–197, 200&lt;/ref&gt; At an evening party in [[Buckingham Palace]], he introduced her to his mother—his father was outraged,&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; primarily on account of her marital history, as divorced people were generally excluded from court.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Beaverbrook|first=Lord|authorlink=Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|title=The Abdication of King Edward VIII|editor=[[A. J. P. Taylor]]|publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=London|year=1966|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward showered Wallis with money and jewels,&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 126, 155; Sebba, pp. 103–104; Ziegler, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 1935, and again later in the year, he holidayed with her in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 117, 134&lt;/ref&gt; His courtiers became increasingly alarmed as the affair began to interfere with his official duties.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 58 and 71&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the head of the [[Metropolitan Police]] [[Special Branch]] told the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]] that Wallis was also having an affair with Guy Marcus Trundle, who was &quot;said to be employed by the [[Ford Motor Company]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Report from Superintendent A. Canning to Sir [[Philip Game]], 3 July 1935, [[National Archives]], PRO MEPO 10/35, quoted in Williams, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of an affair were doubted, however, by Captain Val Bailey, who knew Trundle well and whose mother had an affair with Trundle for nearly two decades,&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;&gt;{{citation|first=James|last=Fox|title=The Oddest Couple|journal=[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]|issue=517|pages=276–291|date=1 September 2003|issn=0733-8899}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Susan Williams (historian)|historian Susan Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abdication crisis==
{{Main|Abdication of Edward VIII}}

On 20 January 1936, George V died at [[Sandringham House|Sandringham]] and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. The next day, he broke royal protocol by watching the proclamation of his accession from a window of [[St James's Palace]], in the company of the still-married Wallis.&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 119; Duke of Windsor, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; It was becoming apparent to Court and Government circles that the new [[King-Emperor]] meant to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 277–278&lt;/ref&gt; The King's behaviour and his relationship with Wallis made him unpopular with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-led [[UK National Government|British government]], as well as distressing his mother and his brother the [[George VI|Duke of York]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 289–292&lt;/ref&gt; The British media remained deferential to the monarchy, and no stories of the affair were reported in the domestic press, but foreign media widely reported their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 173; Sebba, pp. 136, 141; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 237, 242&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of George V, before her divorce from her second husband, Simpson reportedly said, &quot;Soon I shall be {{sic|Queen of England}}&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Lucy|last=Moore|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/mar/31/queenmother.monarchy3|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=31 March 2002|title=A wicked twinkle and a streak of steel |accessdate=3 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monarch of the United Kingdom is [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]—at the time of the proposed marriage, and until 2002, the [[Church of England]] disapproved of, and would not perform, the remarriage of divorced people if their former spouse was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.churchofengland.org/media/37453/mcad1.doc|title=Marriage in Church After a Divorce|publisher=Church of England|accessdate=9 March 2013|format=doc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915022305/http://www.churchofengland.org/media/37453/mcad1.doc|archivedate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constitutionally, the King was required to be in communion with the Church of England, but his proposed marriage conflicted with the Church's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Beaverbrook, pp. 39–44, 122&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, at the time both the Church and English law only recognised adultery as a legitimate ground for divorce.  Since she had divorced her first husband on grounds of &quot;mutual incompatibility&quot;, there was a possibility that her second marriage, as well as her prospective marriage to Edward, would be considered [[bigamous]] if her first divorce had been challenged in court.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British and Dominion governments believed that a twice divorced woman was politically, socially, and morally unsuitable as a prospective consort.&lt;ref name=&quot;ziegler&quot;&gt;Ziegler, pp. 305–307&lt;/ref&gt; She was perceived by many in the [[British Empire]] as a woman of &quot;limitless ambition&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Horace Wilson]] writing to [[Neville Chamberlain]], 10 December 1936, National Archives PREM 1/453, quoted in Sebba, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; who was pursuing the King because of his wealth and position.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 234, 312&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallis had already filed for divorce from her second husband on the grounds that he had committed adultery with her childhood friend Mary Kirk and the [[decree nisi]] was granted on 27 October 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 82, 92&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the King consulted with the [[British prime minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]], on a way to marry Wallis and keep the throne. The King suggested a [[morganatic marriage]], where he would remain king but Wallis would not be queen, but this was rejected by Baldwin and the prime ministers of Australia, Canada, and the [[Union of South Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ziegler&quot; /&gt; If the King were to marry Wallis against Baldwin's advice, the Government would be required to resign, causing a constitutional crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Beaverbrook, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallis's relationship with the King had become public knowledge in the United Kingdom by early December. She decided to flee the country as the scandal broke, and was driven to the south of France in a dramatic race to outrun the press.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 213–218; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 255–269&lt;/ref&gt; For the next three months, she was under siege by the media at the Villa Lou Viei, near [[Cannes]], the home of her close friends Herman and Katherine Rogers,&lt;ref&gt;Duke of Windsor, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; whom she later thanked effusively in her ghost-written memoirs. On her instructions, according to [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]] on the basis of an interview with Rogers's stepdaughter-in-law 80 years later,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/wallis-in-love-the-untold-true-passion-of-the-duchess-of-windsor-andrew-morton-review-a3773211.html|title=Wallis in Love by Andrew Morton - review: Did she ever love the Duke of Windsor?|first=David |last=Sexton|date=22 February 2018|work=Evening Standard|access-date=5 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ghost-writer made no mention of her confession that Herman Rogers was actually the love of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Morton|first=Andrew|year=2018|title=Wallis in Love|publisher=Michael O'Mara Books|isbn=978-1-78243-722-2|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; At her hideaway, Wallis was pressured by [[Peregrine Cust, 6th Baron Brownlow|Lord Brownlow]], the King's [[lord-in-waiting]], to renounce the King. On 7 December 1936, Lord Brownlow read to the press her statement, which he had helped her draft, indicating Wallis's readiness to give up the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Adrian|last=Tinniswood|authorlink=Adrian Tinniswood|title=Belton House|publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust]]|year=1992|page=[https://archive.org/details/beltonhouselinco00adri/page/34 34]|isbn=978-0-7078-0113-1|title-link=Belton House}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Edward was determined to marry Wallis. [[John Theodore Goddard]], Wallis's solicitor, stated: {{nobreak|&quot;[his]}} client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but the other end of the wicket [Edward VIII] was determined.&quot; This seemingly indicated that the King had decided he had no option but to abdicate if he wished to marry Wallis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,191136,00.html |title=Edward and Mrs Simpson cast in new light|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|author2=Evans, Rob|date=2 March 2000|journal=The Guardian|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikisource|Edward VIII of the United Kingdom's Abdication}}
The King signed the [[Instrument of Abdication]] on 10 December 1936, in the presence of his three surviving brothers, the Duke of York (who would ascend the throne the following day as George VI), the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] and the [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]]. Special laws passed by the Parliaments of the [[Dominion]]s finalised Edward's abdication the following day, or in Ireland's case one day later. On 11 December 1936, Edward said in a radio broadcast, &quot;I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility, and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duke of Windsor, p. 413&quot;/&gt;

Edward left Britain for Austria, where he stayed at Schloss [[Enzesfeld-Lindabrunn|Enzesfeld]], the home of Baron Eugen and Baroness Kitty de [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]]. Edward had to remain apart from Wallis until there was no danger of compromising the granting of a decree absolute in her divorce proceedings.&lt;ref name=BHK/&gt; Upon her divorce being made final in May 1937, she changed her name by [[deed poll]] to Wallis Warfield, resuming her maiden name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waycross&quot;&gt;{{citation|author=McMillan, Richard D.|title=Duke Awaiting His Wedding Day|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=koNaAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2457,4252801&amp;dq=wallis+simpson+deed+poll&amp;hl=en|journal=Waycross Journal-Herald|date=11 May 1937|accessdate=6 September 2011|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were reunited at the [[Château de Candé]], [[Monts, Indre-et-Loire|Monts]], France, on 4 May 1937.&lt;ref name=BHK&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 106–118; King, pp. 253–254, 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third marriage: Duchess of Windsor==
[[File:Candé Castle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Château de Candé]], Monts, France]]
Wallis and Edward married one month later on 3 June 1937 at the [[Château de Candé]], lent to them by French millionaire [[Charles Bedaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 73; Sebba, pp. 198, 205–209&lt;/ref&gt; The date would have been [[King George V]]'s 72nd birthday; [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] thought the wedding had been scheduled for then as a deliberate slight.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Queen Mary to Queen Elizabeth, 21 May 1937, Royal Archives, QEQM/PRIV/RF, quoted in {{citation|last=Shawcross|first=William|authorlink=William Shawcross|title=Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother: The Official Biography|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4050-4859-0|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; No member of Edward's family attended.

In November, Ernest Simpson married Mary Kirk.&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was created [[Duke of Windsor]] by his brother King George VI prior to the marriage. However, [[letters patent]], passed by the new king and unanimously supported by the Dominion governments,&lt;ref&gt;Diary of [[Neville Chamberlain]] quoted in Bradford, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; prevented Wallis, now the Duchess of Windsor, from sharing her husband's [[Style (manner of address)|style]] of &quot;[[Royal Highness]]&quot;. George VI's firm view that the Duchess should not be given a royal title was shared by Queen Mary and George's wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2003/january30/edward_duke.htm|title=Home Office memo on the Duke and Duchess's title|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the [[British royal family]] did not accept the Duchess and would not receive her formally, although the former king sometimes met his mother and siblings after his abdication. Some biographers have suggested that Wallis's sister-in-law, Queen Elizabeth, remained bitter towards her for her role in bringing George VI to the throne (which she may have seen as a factor in his early death)&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; and for prematurely behaving as Edward's consort when she was his mistress.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 172; King, pp. 171–172&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were denied by Queen Elizabeth's close friends, such as the [[Hugh FitzRoy, 11th Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]], who wrote that she &quot;never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor, except to say she really hadn't got a clue what she was dealing with.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hogg|first=James|author2=Mortimer, Michael|title=The Queen Mother Remembered|publisher=BBC Books|year=2002|isbn=978-0-563-36214-2|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Elizabeth was said to have referred to Simpson as &quot;that woman&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jill|last=Lawless |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/17/AR2011031700956_2.html|work=The Washington Post|date=17 March 2011 |title=Move over, Kate: Wallis Simpson back as style icon |accessdate=3 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Duchess of Windsor referred to Queen Elizabeth as &quot;Mrs. Temple&quot; and &quot;Cookie&quot;, alluding to her solid figure and fondness for food, and to her daughter, Princess Elizabeth (later [[Queen Elizabeth II]]), as &quot;Shirley&quot;, as in [[Shirley Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Secret File of the Duke of Windsor'', p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchess bitterly resented the denial of the royal title and the refusal of the Duke's relatives to accept her as part of the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also, Bloch, ''Wallis and Edward: Letters 1931–1937'', pp. 231, 233 cited in Bradford, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Within the household of the Duke and Duchess, the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; was used by those who were close to the couple.&lt;ref name=&quot;style&quot;&gt;Sebba, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the wife of former [[British Union of Fascists]] leader [[Oswald Mosley]], [[Diana Mitford]], who knew both Queen Elizabeth and the Duchess of Windsor but was only friendly with the latter, the Queen's antipathy toward her sister-in-law may have resulted from jealousy. Lady Mosley wrote to her sister, the [[Deborah Mitford|Duchess of Devonshire]], after the death of the Duke of Windsor, &quot;probably the theory of their [the Windsors'] contemporaries that Cake [a Mitford nickname for the Queen Mother, derived from her delighted exclamation at the party at which Deborah Devonshire first met her&lt;!--nickname explained on p. 309--&gt;] was rather in love with him [the Duke] (as a girl) &amp; took second best, may account for much.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Lady Mosley to the [[Deborah Mitford|Duchess of Devonshire]], 5 June 1972, in Mosley, Charlotte (ed.)

[[File:Duke and Duchess of Windsor meet Adolf Hitler 1937.jpg|right|thumb|The Duke and Duchess of Windsor with [[Adolf Hitler]], 1937]]
The Duke and Duchess lived in France in the pre-war years. In 1937, they made a [[Duke and Duchess of Windsor's tour of Germany, 1937|high-profile visit to Germany]] and met [[Adolf Hitler]] at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]], his [[Berchtesgaden]] retreat. After the visit, Hitler said of Wallis, &quot;she would have made a good Queen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of Hitler's interpreter [[Paul Schmidt (interpreter)|Paul Schmidt]], quoted in King, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; The visit tended to corroborate the strong suspicions of many in government and society that the Duchess was a German agent,&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot; /&gt; a claim that she ridiculed in her letters to the Duke.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] files compiled in the 1930s also portray her as a possible [[Nazi]] sympathiser. [[Duke Carl Alexander of Württemberg]] told the FBI that she and leading Nazi [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] had been lovers in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4451107,00.html|first=Rob|last=Evans|author2=Hencke, David|title=Wallis Simpson, the Nazi minister, the telltale monk and an FBI plot|journal=The Guardian|date=29 June 2002|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were even rather improbable reports during the Second World War that she kept a signed photograph of Ribbentrop on her bedside table.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duke of Windsor's War'', p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
As the German troops advanced, the Duke and Duchess fled south from their Paris home, first to [[Biarritz]] then to Spain in June. She told United States ambassador to Spain [[Alexander W.

They stayed in [[Cascais]], at Casa de Santa Maria, the home of Ricardo do Espírito Santo e Silva, a banker who was suspected of being a German agent.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duke of Windsor's War'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1940, the Duke and Duchess travelled by commercial liner to [[the Bahamas]] where he was installed as governor.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 350–352; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 344–345&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis performed her role as the Bahamas' first lady competently for five years; she worked actively for the [[Red Cross]] and in the improvement of infant welfare.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 368–376; Vickers, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; However, she hated [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], calling it &quot;our [[Saint Helena|St Helena]]&quot; in a reference to [[Napoleon]]'s final place of exile.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 153, 159&lt;/ref&gt; She was heavily criticised in the British press for her extravagant shopping in the United States, undertaken when Britain was enduring privations such as rationing and blackout.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; She referred to the local population as &quot;lazy, thriving niggers&quot; in letters to her aunt, which reflected her upbringing in the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] South.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;When telling a story of how Wallis complained about blacks being allowed on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)]], Joanne Cummings, the wife of [[Nathan Cummings]], said of Wallis, &quot;She grew up in the South, at a certain time, with certain prejudices.&quot; Source: Menkes, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] strenuously objected in 1941 when she and her husband planned to tour the Caribbean aboard a yacht belonging to Swedish magnate [[Axel Wenner-Gren]], whom Churchill said was &quot;pro-German&quot;, and Churchill complained again when the Duke gave a &quot;defeatist&quot; interview.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 130; King, pp. 377–378&lt;/ref&gt; Another of their acquaintances, [[Charles Bedaux]], who had hosted their wedding, was arrested on charges of treason in 1943 but committed suicide in jail in Miami before the case was brought to trial.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; The British establishment distrusted the Duchess; [[Alexander Hardinge, 2nd Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Sir Alexander Hardinge]] wrote that her suspected anti-British activities were motivated by a desire for revenge against a country that rejected her as its queen.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The couple returned to France and retirement after the defeat of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot;/&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Nixon and the Windsors.jpg|thumb|The Duke and Duchess of Windsor at the White House for dinner with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1970]]
In 1946, when the Duchess was staying at Ednam Lodge, the home of the [[William Ward, 3rd Earl of Dudley|Earl of Dudley]], some of her jewels were stolen. There were rumours that the theft had been masterminded by the royal family as an attempt to regain jewels taken from the [[Royal Collection]] by the Duke, or by the Windsors themselves as part of an insurance fraud—they made a large deposit of loose stones at [[Cartier SA|Cartier]] the following year. However, in 1960, career criminal Richard Dunphie confessed to the crime. The stolen pieces were only a small portion of the Windsor jewels, which were either bought privately, inherited by the Duke, or given to the Duke when he was Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Menkes, pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 they were offered the use of a house by the Paris municipal authorities. The couple lived at [[4 route du Champ d'Entraînement]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], near [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], for most of the remainder of their lives, essentially living a life of easy retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Menkes, pp. 11–48&lt;/ref&gt; They travelled frequently between Europe and America aboard [[ocean liners]]. They bought a second house in the country, ''Moulin de la Tuilerie'' or &quot;The Mill&quot; in [[Gif-sur-Yvette]], where they soon became close friends of their neighbours, [[Oswald Mosley|Oswald]] and [[Diana Mosley]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 545&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Diana Mosley claimed that the Duke and Duchess shared her and her husband's views that Hitler should have been given a free hand to destroy Communism;&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; as the Duke wrote in the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' of 13 December 1966: &quot;it was in Britain's interest and in Europe's too, that Germany be encouraged to strike east and smash Communism forever&amp;nbsp;... I thought the rest of us could be fence-sitters while the Nazis and the Reds slogged it out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 294–296&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Duke and Duchess visited London as the Duke required eye surgery for a [[detached retina]]; [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]], visited them. The Duke's sister, the [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Royal]], also visited just 10 days before her death. They attended her memorial service in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1967, the Duke and Duchess joined the royal family in London for the unveiling of a plaque by Elizabeth II to commemorate the centenary of [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]'s birth.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 455–459; Vickers, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; Both Queen Elizabeth II and [[Prince Charles]] visited the Windsors in Paris in the Duke's later years, the Queen's visit coming only shortly before the Duke died.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Secret File of the Duke of Windsor'', p. 299; Vickers; pp. 15–16, 367&lt;/ref&gt;

==Widowhood==
Upon the Duke's death from throat cancer in 1972, the Duchess travelled to the United Kingdom to attend his funeral,&lt;ref&gt;Conducted by [[Launcelot Fleming]], [[Dean of Windsor]] (''[[The Times]]'', Monday, 5 June 1972; p. 2; Issue 58496; col. E)&lt;/ref&gt; staying at [[Buckingham Palace]] during her visit.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 216; Sebba, p. 272; Vickers, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchess became increasingly frail and eventually succumbed to [[dementia]], living the final years of her life as a recluse, supported by both her husband's estate and an allowance from the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, pp. 274–277; Vickers, pp. 99–120; Ziegler, p. 555&lt;/ref&gt; She suffered several falls and broke her hip twice.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 492–493&lt;/ref&gt;

After Edward's death, the Duchess's French lawyer, [[Suzanne Blum (lawyer and writer)|Suzanne Blum]], assumed [[power of attorney]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 221; King, p. 505; Menkes, p. 199; Vickers, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; Blum sold items belonging to the Duchess to her own friends at lower than market value&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 124–127, 165&lt;/ref&gt; and was accused of exploiting her client in [[Caroline Blackwood]]'s ''The Last of the Duchess'', written in 1980 but not published until 1995, after Blum's death.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; Later, royal biographer [[Hugo Vickers]] called Blum a &quot;Satanic figure&amp;nbsp;... wearing the mantle of good intention to disguise her inner malevolence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the Duchess lost the power of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end, she was bedridden and did not receive any visitors, apart from her doctor and nurses.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 158–168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The Duchess of Windsor died on 24 April 1986 at her home in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], Paris, aged 89.&lt;ref name=&quot;weir&quot;/&gt; Her funeral was held at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]], [[Windsor Castle]], attended by her two surviving sisters-in-law&amp;nbsp;– the Queen Mother and [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]]&amp;nbsp;– and other members of the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 191–198&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], and the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess of Wales]] attended both the funeral ceremony and the burial.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;

She was buried next to Edward in the [[Royal Burial Ground]] near Windsor Castle, as &quot;Wallis, Duchess of Windsor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{citation|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/29/newsid_2500000/2500427.stm| publisher =BBC| title=Simple funeral rites for Duchess|date=29 April 1998|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to an agreement with Queen Elizabeth II in the 1960s, the Duke and Duchess had previously planned for a burial in a purchased cemetery plot at [[Green Mount Cemetery]] in [[Baltimore]], where the Duchess's father was interred.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Windsors had a plot at Green Mount|last=Rasmussen|first=Frederick|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=29 April 1986}}; Vickers, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of the help France gave to the Duke and Duchess in providing them with a home, and in lieu of death duties, the Duchess's collection of [[Louis XVI style]] furniture, some porcelain, and paintings were made over to the French state.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 506; Menkes, pp. 198, 206 and 207&lt;/ref&gt; The British royal family received no major bequests. Most of her estate went to the [[Pasteur Institute]] medical research foundation, on the instructions of Suzanne Blum. The decision took the royal family and the Duchess's friends by surprise, as she had shown little interest in charity during her life.&lt;ref&gt;Menkes, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Sotheby's]] auction in Geneva, in April 1987, the Duchess's remarkable jewellery collection raised $45 million for the institute, approximately seven times its pre-sale estimate.&lt;ref&gt;Culme, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Blum later claimed that Egyptian entrepreneur [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]] tried to purchase the jewels for a &quot;rock bottom price&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Wadler, Joyce |author2=Hauptfuhrer, Fred |date=8 January 1990|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116503,00.html|title=Egypt's Al Fayed Restores the House Fit for a Former King |work=[[People (American magazine)|People]]|volume=33|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Fayed bought much of the non-financial estate, including the lease of the Paris mansion. An auction of his collection was announced in July 1997 for later that year in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt; Delayed by [[Dodi Al-Fayed|his son]]'s death in [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|the car crash]] that also claimed the life of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], the sale raised more than £14 million for charity in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt;

==Legacy==
Wallis was plagued by rumours of other lovers. Gay American playboy [[James Paul Donahue Jr.|Jimmy Donahue]], an heir to the [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] fortune, claimed to have had a liaison with her in the 1950s, but Donahue was notorious for his inventive pranks and rumour-mongering.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Christopher |last=Wilson|title=Dancing With the Devil: the Windsors and Jimmy Donahue|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|year=2001|isbn=978-0-00-653159-3}}; King, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis's memoirs ''The Heart Has Its Reasons'' were published in 1956, and biographer [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]] said that &quot;facts were remorselessly rearranged in what amounted to a self-performed face-lift&quot;. He describes the Duchess as &quot;charismatic, electric and compulsively ambitious&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, pp. 452–453&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural depictions of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson|Fictional depictions of the Duchess]] include the novel ''[[Famous Last Words (novel)|Famous Last Words]]'' (1981) by Canadian author [[Timothy Findley]], which portrays her as a manipulative conspirator,&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rose Tremain]]'s short story &quot;The Darkness of Wallis Simpson&quot; (2006), which depicts her more sympathetically in her final years of ill health.&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; Hearsay and conjecture have clouded assessment of the Duchess of Windsor's life, not helped by her own manipulation of the truth. But there is no document which proves directly that she was anything other than a victim of her own ambition, who lived out a great romance that became a great tragedy. In the opinion of her biographers, &quot;she experienced the ultimate fairy tale, becoming the adored favourite of the most glamorous bachelor of his time. The idyll went wrong when, ignoring her pleas, he threw up his position to spend the rest of his life with her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 231; See also {{citation|last=Weintraub|first=Stanley|authorlink=Stanley Weintraub|title=The Love Letters of the Duchess of Windsor|journal=[[The Washington Post]]|date=8 June 1986|page=X05}} for a similar view.&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchess herself is reported to have summed up her life in a sentence: &quot;You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 388; Wilson, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry VI''' (6 December 1421 – 21 May 1471) was [[King of England]] from 1422 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471, and [[English claims to the French throne#Kings of France (1422)|disputed]] [[King of France]] from 1422 to 1453. The only child of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], he succeeded to the English throne at the age of nine months upon his father's death, and succeeded to the French throne on the death of his maternal grandfather, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], shortly afterwards.

Henry inherited the long-running [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337–1453), in which his uncle [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] contested [[English claims to the French throne|his claim to the French throne]]. He is the only English monarch to also have been crowned King of France (as '''Henry II''', in 1431). His early reign, when [[Regency government, 1422–1437|several people were ruling for him]], saw the pinnacle of English power in France, but subsequent military, diplomatic, and economic problems had seriously endangered the English cause by the time Henry was declared fit to rule in 1437. He found his realm in a difficult position, faced with setbacks in France and divisions among the nobility at home. Unlike his father, Henry is described as timid, shy, passive, well-intentioned, and averse to warfare and violence; he was also at times mentally unstable. His ineffective reign saw the gradual loss of the [[Dual monarchy of England and France|English lands in France]]. Partially in the hope of achieving peace, in 1445 Henry married Charles VII's niece, the ambitious and strong-willed [[Margaret of Anjou]]. The peace policy failed, leading to the murder of one of Henry's key advisers, [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], and the war recommenced, with France taking the upper hand; by 1453, [[Pale of Calais|Calais]] was Henry's only remaining territory on the continent.

As the situation in France worsened, there was a related increase in political instability in England. With Henry effectively unfit to rule, power was exercised by quarrelsome nobles, while [[political faction|factions]] and [[favourite]]s encouraged the rise of disorder in the country. Regional magnates and soldiers returning from France formed and maintained increasing numbers of private armed [[retinue|retainers]], with whom they fought one another, terrorised their neighbours, paralysed the courts, and dominated the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cram |date=1948 |first=Paul |section=Western Europe |title=Encyclopedia of World History |title-link=Encyclopedia of World History |edition=revised |editor=[[William L.

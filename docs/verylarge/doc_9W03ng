Dixon met [[Leonard Caston]] at a boxing gym, where they would harmonize at times. Dixon performed in several vocal groups in Chicago, but it was Caston that persuaded him to pursue music seriously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castonbio1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p63195|pure_url=yes}}|title=Leonard Caston|last=Eder|first=Bruce|year=2010 |work=Biography of Leonard Caston|publisher=Rovi Corporation|access-date=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caston built him his first bass, made of a tin can and one string. Dixon's experience singing bass made the instrument familiar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willie Dixon pp. 207&quot;/&gt; He also learned to play the guitar.

In 1939, Dixon was a founding member of the Five Breezes, with Caston, Joe Bell, Gene Gilmore and Willie Hawthorne. The group blended blues, [[jazz]], and vocal harmonies, in the mode of the [[Ink Spots]]. Dixon's progress on the [[upright bass]] came to an abrupt halt with the advent of World War II, when he refused induction into military service as a [[conscientious objector]] and was imprisoned for ten months.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot; /&gt; He refused to go to war because he would not fight for a nation in which institutionalized racism and racist laws were prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, Jim (2014). &quot;Book Review: ''Willie Dixon: Preacher of the Blues''.&quot; ''Journal of American Folklore'' 127: 100–101. ProQuest.Web. October 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he formed a group named the Four Jumps of Jive. He then reunited with Caston, forming the Big Three Trio,{{sfn|Palmer|1982|p=166}} which went on to record for [[Columbia Records]].

===Pinnacle of career===
[[File:Jlwandwilliedixon.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Dixon (right), with his friend [[Joe Louis Walker]]]]
Dixon signed with [[Chess Records]] as a recording artist, but he began performing less, being more involved with administrative tasks for the label. By 1951, he was a full-time employee at Chess, where he acted as producer, [[Artists and repertoire|talent scout]], [[session musician]] and staff songwriter. He was also a producer for the Chess subsidiary [[Checker Records]]. His relationship with Chess was sometimes strained, but he stayed with the label from 1948 to the early 1960s. During this time Dixon's output and influence were prodigious. From late 1956 to early 1959, he worked in a similar capacity for [[Cobra Records]], for which he produced early singles for [[Otis Rush]], [[Magic Sam]], and [[Buddy Guy]].{{sfn|Dixon|Snowden|1990|pp=103–112}} He later recorded for [[Bluesville Records]].  From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, Dixon ran his own record label, [[Yambo Records]], and two subsidiary labels, Supreme and Spoonful. He released his 1971 album, ''Peace?'', on Yambo and also singles by [[McKinley Mitchell]], [[Lucky Peterson]] and others.{{sfn|Dixon|Snowden|1990|p=244}}

Dixon is considered one of the key figures in the creation of [[Chicago blues]]. He worked with [[Chuck Berry]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Otis Rush]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Joe Louis Walker]], [[Little Walter]], [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]], [[Koko Taylor]], [[Little Milton]], [[Eddie Boyd]], [[Jimmy Witherspoon]], [[Lowell Fulson]], [[Willie Mabon]], [[Memphis Slim]], [[Washboard Sam]], [[Jimmy Rogers]], [[Sam Lay]] and others.

In December 1964, the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] reached number one on the UK Singles Chart with their cover of Dixon's &quot;[[Little Red Rooster]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the group also covered &quot;[[I Just Want To Make Love To You]]&quot; on their debut album, ''[[The Rolling Stones (album)|The Rolling Stones]]''.

===Copyright battles===
In his later years, Dixon became a tireless ambassador for the blues and a vocal advocate for its practitioners, founding the Blues Heaven Foundation, which works to preserve the legacy of the blues and to secure copyrights and royalties for blues musicians who were exploited in the past. Speaking with the simple eloquence that was a hallmark of his songs, Dixon claimed, &quot;The blues are the roots and the other musics are the fruits. It's better keeping the roots alive, because it means better fruits from now on. The blues are the roots of all American music. As long as American music survives, so will the blues.&quot;
In 1977, unhappy with the small royalties paid by Chess's publishing company, Arc Music, Dixon and Muddy Waters sued Arc and, with the proceeds from the settlement, founded their own publishing company, Hoochie Coochie Music.{{sfn|Mitsutoshi|2010|p=67}}

In 1987, Dixon reached an out-of-court settlement with the rock band Led Zeppelin after suing for plagiarism in the band's use of his music in &quot;[[Bring It On Home (Sonny Boy Williamson II song)|Bring It On Home]]&quot; and lyrics from his composition &quot;You Need Love&quot; (1962) in the band's recording of &quot;[[Whole Lotta Love]]&quot;.{{sfn|Mitsutoshi|2010|p=197}}

===Death and legacy===
Dixon's health increasingly deteriorated during the 1970s and the 1980s, primarily as a result of long-term [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. Eventually one of his legs was [[amputate]]d.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot; /&gt;

Dixon was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] in 1980, in the inaugural session of the [[Blues Foundation]]'s ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php4?YearId=25 1980 Hall of Fame Inductees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305080004/http://www.blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php4?YearId=25 |date=March 5, 2007 }}&quot;.

Dixon died of heart failure on January 29, 1992, in Burbank, California,&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot; /&gt; and was buried in [[Burr Oak Cemetery and Restvale Cemetery|Burr Oak Cemetery]], in [[Alsip, Illinois]].

In 2007, Dixon was honored with a marker on the [[Mississippi Blues Trail]] in Vicksburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vicksburgpost.com/2007/06/29/willie-dixons-way-mural-marker-party-honor-city-son062907/|title=Willie Dixon's way: Mural, marker, party honor city son{{!}}[06/29/07] - The Vicksburg Post|date=June 29, 2007|work=The Vicksburg Post|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustav I''', born '''Gustav Eriksson''' of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa]] [[Swedish nobility|noble family]] and later known as '''Gustav Vasa''' (12 May 1496&lt;ref&gt;Gustav's gravestone gives his year of birth as 1485, and according to his son [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]] he had been born in 1488. His nephew [[Per Brahe the Elder|Per Brahe]] gives 1495 as Gustav's year of birth, and historian Erik Göransson Tegel the year 1490. Brahe and Tegel agree that Gustav was born on [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Thursday]], 12 May, and these days coincided in 1491 and 1496.&lt;/ref&gt; – 29 September 1560), was [[King of Sweden]] from 1523 until his death in 1560,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Sweden.html|title=Sweden|publisher=World Statesmen|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously self-recognised Protector of the Realm (''Riksföreståndare'') from 1521, during the ongoing [[Swedish War of Liberation]] against King [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II of Denmark, Norway and Sweden]]. Gustav rose to lead the rebel movement following the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]], where his father was executed. Gustav's election as king on 6 June 1523 and his triumphant [[Conquest of Stockholm|entry into Stockholm]] eleven days later marked Sweden's final secession from the [[Kalmar Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.sweden.org.za/swedish-monarchy-gustav-vasa.html  |title=  Swedish Monarchy – Gustav Vasa|publisher =  sweden.org.za

As king, Gustav proved an energetic administrator with a ruthless streak not inferior to his predecessor's, brutally suppressing subsequent uprisings ([[Dalecarlian Rebellions|three in Dalarna]] – which had once been the first region to support his claim to the throne – one in [[Västergötland]], and [[Dacke War|one in Småland]]). He worked to raise [[taxation in Sweden|taxes]] and bring about a [[Reformation in Sweden]], replacing the prerogatives of local landowners, noblemen and clergy with centrally appointed governors and bishops. His 37-year rule, which was the longest of a mature Swedish king to that date (subsequently passed by [[Gustav V]] and [[Carl XVI Gustav]]) saw a complete break with not only the Danish - Norwegian supremacy but also the [[Roman Catholic Church]], whose assets were nationalised, with the [[Lutheran]] [[Church of Sweden]] established under his personal control. He became the first truly [[autocratic]] native Swedish sovereign and was a skilled [[bureaucrat]] and propagandist, with tales of his largely fictitious adventures during the liberation struggle still widespread to this day. In 1544, he abolished [[Medieval Sweden]]'s [[elective monarchy]] and replaced it with a [[hereditary monarchy]] under the [[House of Vasa]], which held the Swedish throne until 1654. Thus, three of his sons, [[Eric XIV of Sweden|Eric XIV]], [[John III of Sweden|John III]] and [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]], all held the kingship at different points.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web|url =https://snl.no/Gustav_1_Vasa|title=  Gustav 1 Vasa|publisher =  Store norske leksikon |author=  Magne Njåstad

Gustav I has subsequently been labelled the founder of modern Sweden, and the &quot;[[Pater Patriae|father of the nation]]&quot;. Gustav liked to compare himself to [[Moses]], whom he believed to have also liberated his people and established a sovereign state. As a person, Gustav was known for ruthless methods and a bad temper, but also a fondness for music and had a certain sly wit and ability to outmaneuver and annihilate his opponents. He founded one of the now oldest orchestras of the world, the ''[[Kungliga Hovkapellet]]'' (Royal Court Orchestra). Royal housekeeping accounts from 1526 mention twelve musicians including [[wind instrument|wind players]] and a [[timpani]]st but no [[string instrument|string players]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunilla Petersén, &quot;[http://www.hovkapellet.com/sv/om_orkestern/om_orkestern.do#english From the History of the Royal Court Orchestra 1526–2007]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Today the ''Kungliga Hovkapellet'' is the orchestra of the [[Royal Swedish Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ne.se/lang/gustav-vasa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Brev av Gustav Vasa (Letters of Gustav Vasa)'' edited by [[Nils Edén]], [[Norstedts]], Stockholm, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life==
Gustav Eriksson, a son of [[Cecilia Månsdotter Eka]] and [[Erik Johansson Vasa]], was probably born in 1496. The birth most likely took place in [[Rydboholm Castle]], northeast of Stockholm, the manor house of the father, Erik. The newborn got his name, Gustav, from Erik's grandfather Gustav Anundsson.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erik Johansson's parents were Johan Kristersson and Birgitta Gustafsdotter of the dynasties Vasa and [[Sture]] respectively, both dynasties of high nobility. Birgitta Gustafsdotter was the sister of [[Sten Sture the Elder]], regent of Sweden. Being a relative and ally of uncle Sten Sture, Erik inherited the regent's estates in [[Uppland]] and [[Södermanland]] when the latter died in 1503. Although a member of a family with considerable properties since childhood, Gustav Eriksson would later be the holder of possessions of a much greater dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, pp. 25ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to genealogical research, Birgitta Gustafsdotter and Sten Sture (and consequently also Gustav Vasa) were descended from King [[Sverker II of Sweden]], through King Sverker's granddaughter Benedikte Sunesdotter (who was married to Svantepolk Knutsson, son of Duke of Reval). One of King Gustav's great-grandmothers was a half-sister of King [[Charles VIII of Sweden]].

==Resistance against the Danish==

===Supporting the Sture party===
Since the end of the 14th century, Sweden had been a part of the [[Kalmar Union]] with Denmark and Norway. The Danish dominance in this union occasionally led to uprisings in Sweden. During Gustav's childhood, parts of the Swedish nobility tried to make Sweden independent. Gustav and his father Erik supported the party of [[Sten Sture the Younger]], regent of Sweden from 1512, and its struggle against the Danish King [[Christian II]]. Following the [[battle of Brännkyrka]] in 1518, where Sten Sture's troops beat the Danish forces, it was decided that Sten Sture and King Christian would meet in [[Österhaninge]] for
negotiations. To guarantee the safety of the king, the Swedish side sent six men as hostages to be kept by the Danes for as long as the negotiations lasted. However, Christian did not show up for the negotiations, violated the deal with the Swedish side and took the hostages aboard ships carrying them to [[Copenhagen]]. The six members of the kidnapped hostage were [[Hemming Gadh]], Lars Siggesson (Sparre), Jöran Siggesson (Sparre), Olof Ryning, Bengt Nilsson (Färla) – and Gustav Eriksson. Gustav was held in [[Kalø Castle]] where he was treated very well after promising he would not make attempts to escape. A reason for this gentle treatment was King Christian's hope to convince the six men to switch sides, and turn against their leader Sten Sture. This strategy was successful regarding all men but Gustav, who stayed loyal to the Sture party.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, pp. 38ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ChristianII of denmark.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Christian II, Gustav I's main antagonist]]
In 1519, Gustav Eriksson escaped from Kalø. He fled to the Hanseatic city of [[Lübeck]] where he arrived on 30 September. How he managed to escape is not certain, but according to a somewhat likely story, he disguised himself as a [[bullocky]]. For this, Gustav Eriksson got the nicknames &quot;King Oxtail&quot; and &quot;Gustav Cow Butt&quot;, something he indeed disliked. When a swordsman drank to His Majesty &quot;Gustav Cow Butt&quot; in Kalmar in 1547, the swordsman was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

While staying in Lübeck, Gustav could hear about developments in his native Sweden. While he was there, Christian II mobilised to attack Sweden in an effort to seize power from Sten Sture and his supporters. In 1520, the forces of King Christian were triumphant. Sten Sture died in March, but some strongholds, including the Swedish capital Stockholm, were still able to withstand the Danish forces. Gustav left Lübeck on a ship, and was put ashore south of [[Kalmar]] on 31 May.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, pp. 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems Gustav stayed largely inactive during his first months back on Swedish soil. According to some sources, Gustav received an invitation to the coronation of Christian. This was to take place in the newly captured Stockholm in November. Even though King Christian had promised amnesty to his enemies within the Sture party, including Gustav Eriksson, the latter chose to decline the invitation. The coronation took place on 4 November and days of festivities in a friendly spirit followed. When the celebration had lasted a few days, the castle was locked and the former enemies of King Christian were imprisoned. Accusations against the old supporters of Sten Sture regarding heresy were brought forward. The following day the sentences were announced. During the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]], close to 100 people were executed on [[Stortorget]], among them Gustav Eriksson's father, Erik Johansson, and nephew, [[Joakim Brahe]]. Gustav himself was at the time staying at Räfsnäs, close to [[Gripsholm Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, pp. 45ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Dalarna===
Gustav Eriksson had reasons to fear for his life and left Räfsnäs. He travelled to the province of [[Dalarna]], in what was then northwestern Sweden. What happened there has been described in Peder Svart's chronicle, which can be described as a strongly biased heroic tale about Gustav Eriksson. The Dalarna adventures of Gustav that could be described as a part of the national heritage of Sweden, can therefore not be verified in a satisfying way. He is supposed to have tried to gather troops among the peasantry in the province, but with little success initially. Being chased by men loyal to king Christian and failing at creating an army to challenge the king, Gustav Eriksson had no other alternative but to flee to Norway. While he made his way from [[Mora, Sweden|Mora]] via [[Lima, Sweden|Lima]] to Norway, people that had recently turned down Gustav's call for support against the king changed their minds. Representatives of that group caught up with Gustav before he had reached Norway and convinced him to follow them back to Mora. Gustav Eriksson's run towards Norway and back has formed the background to the famous cross-country ski race [[Vasaloppet]].&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, pp. 52ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swedish War of Liberation===
Gustav Eriksson was appointed ''hövitsman''. The rebel force he led grew. In February 1520 it consisted of 400 men, mainly from the area around [[Lake Siljan]]. The first big clash in the [[Swedish War of Liberation|Dissolution of Kalmar Union]] that now started, took place at Brunnbäck's Ferry in April, where a rebel army defeated an army loyal to the king. The sacking of the city of [[Västerås]] and with it controlling important copper and silver mines gave Gustav Vasa resources and supporters flocked to him. Other parts of Sweden, for example the [[Götaland]] provinces of [[Småland]] and [[Västergötland]], also saw rebellions. The leading noblemen of Götaland joined Gustav Eriksson's forces and, in [[Vadstena]] in August, they declared Gustav regent of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, pp. 59ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The election of Gustav Eriksson as a regent made many Swedish nobles, who had so far stayed loyal to King Christian, switch sides. Some noblemen, still loyal to the king, chose to leave Sweden, while others were killed. As a result, the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Swedish Privy Council]] lost old members who were replaced by supporters of Gustav Eriksson. Most fortified cities and castles were conquered by Gustav's rebels, but the strongholds with the best defences, including Stockholm, were still under Danish control. In 1522, after negotiations between Gustav Eriksson's people and Lübeck, the Hanseatic city joined the war against Denmark. The winter of 1523 saw the joint forces attack the Danish and Norwegian areas of Scania, Halland, Blekinge and Bohuslän. During this winter, Christian II was overthrown and replaced by [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]]. The new king openly claimed the Swedish throne and had hopes Lübeck would abandon the Swedish rebels. The German city, preferring an independent Sweden to a strong Kalmar Union dominated by Denmark, took advantage of the situation and put pressure on the rebels. The city wanted privileges on future trade as well as guarantees regarding the loans they had granted the rebels. The Privy Council and Gustav Eriksson knew the support from Lübeck was absolutely crucial. As a response, the council decided to appoint Gustav Eriksson king.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, pp. 67ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Election as king====
[[Image:RoggeborgenSträngnäs.JPG|right|150px|thumb|Roggeborgen in Strängnäs was a central location during the events when Gustav Eriksson was elected king of Sweden.]]

The ceremonial election of the regent Gustav Eriksson as king of Sweden took place when the leading men of Sweden got together in [[Strängnäs]] in June 1523.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson2007&quot;&gt;
{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=Gary Dean |title=Warrior Kings of Sweden: The Rise of an Empire in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CPJWfVPgFawC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=6 July 2013|date=1 January 2007|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2873-1|pages=31–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When the councillors of Sweden had chosen Gustav as king, he met with the two visiting councillors of Lübeck. The German representatives supported the appointment without hesitation and declared it an act of God. Gustav stated he had to bow to what was described as the will of God. In a meeting with the Privy Council, Gustav Eriksson announced his decision to accept. In the following ceremony, led by the deacon of Strängnäs, [[Laurentius Andreae]], Gustav swore the royal oath. The next day, bishops and priests joined Gustav in Roggeborgen where Laurentius Andreae raised the holy sacrament above a kneeling Gustav Eriksson. Flanked by the councillors of Lübeck, Gustav Eriksson was brought to [[Strängnäs Cathedral]] where the king sat down in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] with the Swedish privy councillors on one side, and the Lübeck representatives on the other. After the hymn &quot;[[Te Deum]]&quot;, Laurentius Andreae proclaimed Gustav Eriksson king of Sweden. He was, however, still not crowned. In 1983, in remembrance of the election of Gustav as Swedish king on 6 June, that date was declared the [[National Day of Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, pp. 74ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The capture of Stockholm====
Shortly after the events of 1523 in Strängnäs, [[letters patent]] were issued to Lübeck and its allied Hanseatic cities, who now were freed from tolls when trading in Sweden. An agreement, designed by Lübeck negotiators, was made with the Danish defenders in Stockholm. On 17 June the rebels could enter the capital city. At [[Midsummer]], a grand entrance of king Gustav was arranged at Söderport, the southern gate of Stockholm. Celebrations followed, including a mass of thanksgiving in [[Storkyrkan]] (also known as Stockholm Cathedral) led by Peder Jakobsson. Gustav could now install himself in the [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Tre Kronor]] palace.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, pp. 76ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The war ends====
Bailiffs, loyal to the old king Christian, were still holding castles in [[Finland]], a part of Sweden at the time. During the summer and fall of 1523 they all surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, on 24 August 1524, Gustav arrived in Malmö in order to reach a settlement with Denmark - Norway and its king Frederick. The [[Treaty of Malmö]] (in Swedish: ''Malmö recess'') had both positive and negative sides to it, from king Gustav's perspective. The treaty meant that Denmark-Norway acknowledged the independence of Sweden. The hopes Gustav had carried of winning further provinces (Gotland and Blekinge) were however scuttled. The treaty marked the end of the Swedish War of Liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2005, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Reformation==

After Gustav seized power, the previous Archbishop, [[Gustav Trolle]], who at the time held the post of a sort of chancellor, was exiled from the country. Gustav sent a message to [[Pope Clement VII]] requesting the acceptance of a new archbishop selected by Gustav himself: [[Johannes Magnus]].

The Pope sent back his decision demanding that unlawful expulsion of Archbishop Gustav Trolle be rescinded, and that the archbishop be reinstated. Here Sweden's remote geographical location proved to have a marked impact – for the former Archbishop had been allied with Christian, or at least was considered to have been so allied in contemporary Stockholm, and to reinstate him would be close to impossible for Gustav.

The king let the Pope know the impossibility of the request, and the possible results if the Pope persisted, but – for better or worse – the Pope did persist, and refused to accept the king's suggestions of archbishops. At the time, incidentally and for different reasons, there were also four other unoccupied bishop's seats, where the king made suggestions to the Pope about candidates, but the Pope only accepted one of the candidates. Because the Pope refused to budge on the issue of Gustav Trolle, the king, influenced by Lutheran scholar [[Olaus Petri]], in 1531 took it upon himself to appoint yet another archbishop, namely the brother of Olaus, [[Laurentius Petri]]. With this royal act, the Pope lost any influence over the Swedish Church.

In the 1520s, the Petri brothers led a campaign for the introduction of [[Lutheranism]]. The decade saw many events which can be seen as gradual introductions of [[Protestantism]], for instance the marriage of Olaus Petri – a consecrated priest – and several texts published by him, advocating Lutheran dogmas. A translation of the [[New Testament]] had also been published in 1526. After the reformation, a full translation was published in 1540–41, called the [[Gustav Vasa Bible]]. However, knowledge of Greek and Hebrew among Swedish clergymen was not sufficient for a translation from the original sources; instead the work followed the German translation by [[Martin Luther]] in 1534.

Gustav I's breaking with the Catholic Church is virtually simultaneous with [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] doing the same in England; both kings acted following a similar pattern, i.e., a prolonged confrontation with the Pope culminating with the king deciding to take his own decisions independently of Rome.

==Further reign==
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2020}}
[[Image:Gustav I Vasa by Martin Rota.jpg|thumb|200px|Gustav, engraved by [[Martin Rota]] ]]
Gustav encountered resistance from some areas of the country. People from [[Dalarna]] rebelled three times in the first ten years of Gustav's reign, as they considered the king to have been too harsh on everyone he perceived as a supporter of the Danish, and as they resented his introduction of Protestantism. Many of those who had helped Gustav in his war against the Danes became involved in these rebellions and paid for this, several of them with their lives.

Peasants in [[Småland]] rebelled in 1542, fuelled by grievances over taxes, church reform and confiscation of church bells and vestments. For several months this uprising caused Gustav severe difficulties in the dense forests. The king sent a letter to the people of the province of Dalarna, requesting that they should circulate letters to every Swedish province, stating their support for the king with their troops, and urging every other province to do the same. Gustav got his troops, with whose help – and, not least, with paid German mercenaries – he managed to defeat the rebels in the spring of 1543.

The leader of the rebels, [[Nils Dacke]], has traditionally been seen as a [[traitor]] to Sweden. His own letters and proclamations to fellow peasants focused on the suppression of Roman Catholic customs of piety, the King's requisitions of church bells and church plate to be smelted down for money and the general discontent with Gustav's autocratic measures, and the King's letters indicate that Dacke had considerable military success for several months. Historical records state that Nils was seriously wounded during a battle, taking bullet wounds to both legs; if this is true, his survival may have been surprising in view of contemporary medical techniques. Some sources state that Nils was executed by [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|quartering]];&lt;ref&gt;Dackeland/Gustav Vasa – Landsfader eller tyrann? by Lars-Olof Larsson.&lt;/ref&gt; others that he was reduced to the state of an outlaw after recovering from his wounds, and killed while trying to escape through the woods on the border between [[Småland]] and then Danish [[Blekinge]]. It is said that his body parts were displayed throughout Sweden as a warning to other would-be rebels; this is uncertain though his head was likely mounted on a pole at [[Kalmar]]. Modern Swedish scholarship has toned down criticism of Nils Dacke, sometimes making him into a hero in the vein of [[Robin Hood]], particularly in Småland.

Difficulties with the continuation of the Church also troubled Gustav Vasa. The 1540s saw him imposing death sentences upon both the Petri brothers, as well as his former chancellor [[Laurentius Andreae]]. All of them were however granted amnesty, after spending several months in jail. In 1554–1557, he waged [[Russo-Swedish War, 1554-1557|an inconclusive war]] against [[Ivan the Terrible]] of Russia.

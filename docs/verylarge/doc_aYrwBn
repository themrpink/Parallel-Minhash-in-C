Eastwood made his only foray into TV direction with the ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'' episode ''Vanessa in the Garden'' (1985), which starred [[Harvey Keitel]] and Locke as a married couple. This was his first collaboration with [[Steven Spielberg]], who later co-produced ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'' and ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Halbfinger |first=David M. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/movies/21flag.html |title=The Power of an Image Drives Film by Eastwood |work=The New York Times |date=September 21, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402230455/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/movies/21flag.html |archivedate=April 2, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=|access-date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would revisit the Western genre when he directed and starred in ''[[Pale Rider]]'' (1985), a film based on the classic western ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953) and follows a preacher descending from the mists of the Sierras to side with the miners during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1850.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The title is a reference to the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], as the rider of the pale horse is Death, and shows similarities to Eastwood's western ''High Plains Drifter'' (1973) in its themes of morality and justice as well as its exploration of the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; It was hailed as one of the best films of 1985 and the best western to appear for a considerable period, with [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' remarking, &quot;This year (1985) will go down in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood co-starred with [[Marsha Mason]] in the military drama ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'' (1986), about the 1983&amp;nbsp;United States [[invasion of Grenada]]. He portrays a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Gunnery Sergeant]] veteran of the [[Korean War]] and Vietnam War who realizes he is nearing the end of his military service. Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long-time friend and producer Fritz Manes, as well as between Eastwood and the [[United States Department of Defense]] who expressed contempt for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG398&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the film was a commercial rather than a critical success, and has only come to be viewed more favorably in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed $70&amp;nbsp;million domestically.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood starred in ''[[The Dead Pool]]'' (1988), the fifth and final film in the ''Dirty Harry'' series. It co-starred [[Patricia Clarkson]], [[Liam Neeson]], and a young [[Jim Carrey]] who plays Johnny Squares, a drug-addled rock star and the first of the victims on a list of celebrities drawn up by horror film director Peter Swan (Neeson) who are deemed most likely to die, the so-called &quot;Dead Pool&quot;. The list is stolen by an obsessed fan who, in mimicking his favorite director, makes his way through the list killing off celebrities, of which Dirty Harry is also included. ''The Dead Pool'' grossed nearly $38&amp;nbsp;million, relatively low receipts for a ''Dirty Harry'' film. It is generally viewed as the weakest film of the series, though Roger Ebert thought it was as good as the original.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Film journal&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Film journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hAnsAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=May 1, 2011 |date=1988 |publisher=Pubsun Corp. |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Roger Ebert's movie home companion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTshz3206kYC |accessdate=May 1, 2011 |year=1992 |publisher=Andrews and McMeel |isbn=978-0-8362-6243-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood began working on smaller, more personal projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. Always interested in jazz, he directed ''[[Bird (1988 film)|Bird]]'' (1988), a biopic starring [[Forest Whitaker]] as jazz musician [[Charlie Parker|Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker]]. Alto saxophonist [[Jackie McLean]] and [[Spike Lee]], son of jazz bassist [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]] and a long time critic of Eastwood, criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking that it did not capture his true essence and sense of humor.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG433&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood received two [[Golden Globes]] for the film, the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for his lifelong contribution, and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director award]]. However, ''Bird'' was a commercial failure, earning just $11&amp;nbsp;million, which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly-received comedy ''[[Pink Cadillac (film)|Pink Cadillac]]'' (1989). The film is about a [[bounty hunter]] and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman ([[Bernadette Peters]]) who tries to outrun everyone in her husband's prized pink [[Cadillac]]. The film failed both critically and commercially,&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; earning barely more than ''Bird'' and marking a low point in Eastwood's career.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s ===
Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[White Hunter Black Heart]]'' (1990), an adaptation of [[Peter Viertel]]'s ''[[roman à clef]]'', about [[John Huston]] and the making of the classic film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]''. Shot on location in [[Zimbabwe]] in the summer of 1989,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG461&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood directed and co-starred with [[Charlie Sheen]] in ''[[The Rookie (1990 film)|The Rookie]]'', a [[buddy cop]] action film released in December 1990. Critics found the film's plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman's car,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 466&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG467&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 467&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant's legal fees if she did not appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG467&quot; /&gt;

Eastwood revisited the western genre in ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992), a film which he directed and starred in as an aging ex-[[gunfighting|gunfighter]] long past his prime. Scripts existed for the film as early as 1976 under titles such as ''The Cut-Whore Killings'' and ''The William Munny Killings'' but Eastwood delayed the project because he wanted to wait until he was old enough to play his character and to savor it as the last of his western films.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG467&quot; /&gt; ''Unforgiven'' was a major commercial and critical success; Jack Methews of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described it as &quot;the finest classical western to come along since perhaps John Ford's 1956 ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG473&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for nine [[Academy Award]]s,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; (including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Eastwood and Best Original Screenplay for [[David Webb Peoples]]) and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Eastwood.

=== Directing ===
Beginning with the thriller ''Play Misty for Me'', Eastwood has directed over 30 films, including Westerns, action films, and dramas. He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director. ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s [[David Denby]] wrote that, unlike Eastwood,&lt;ref name=&quot;denby20100308&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/08/100308fa_fact_denby?currentPage=all |title=Out of the West |work=The New Yorker |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=September 1, 2012 |author=Denby, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=John Ford appeared in just a few silent films; Howard Hawks never acted in movies. Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Steve McQueen, and Sean Connery never directed a feature. John Wayne directed only twice, and badly; ditto Burt Lancaster. Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each, with mixed commercial and artistic success.}}

From the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take.&lt;ref&gt;Munn, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Biskind19697&quot;&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 196–97 (interviewer Peter Biskind)&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of [[Woody Allen]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and the [[Coen brothers]]. When acting in others' films he sometimes takes over directing, such as for ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'', if he believes production is too slow.{{r|denby20100308}} In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses [[storyboard]]s for developing the layout of a shooting schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentry65&quot;&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 65 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abb173&quot;&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 173 (interviewer Denise Abbott)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pascal235&quot;&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 235 (interviewer [[Pascal Mérigeau]])&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film,&lt;ref name=&quot;Intp678&quot;&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 67–68 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt; considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intp678&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Intp91&quot;&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 91 (interviewer David Thomson)&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film's plot to provide the audience with necessary details, but not &quot;so much that it insults their intelligence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Intp60&quot;&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 60 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, &quot;Eastwood's style is to shoot first and act afterward. He etches his characters virtually without words. He has developed the art of underplaying to the point that anyone around him who so much as flinches looks hammily histrionic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inc1971&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Fayard |first=Judy |work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |title=Who can stand 32,580 seconds of Clint Eastwood? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 |accessdate=March 8, 2011 |date=July 23, 1971 |page=46 |issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter commented that Eastwood's films are &quot;superbly paced: unhurried; cool; and [give] a strong sense of real time, regardless of the speed of the narrative&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Intp45&quot;&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 45 (interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter)&lt;/ref&gt; while Ric Gentry considers Eastwood's pacing &quot;unrushed and relaxed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Intp71&quot;&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 71 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood is fond of low-key lighting and back-lighting to give his films a [[Film noir|&quot;noir-ish&quot;]] feel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biskind19697&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Milan143&quot;&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 143 (interviewer Milan Pavolić)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood's frequent exploration of ethical values has drawn the attention of scholars, who have explored Eastwood's work from ethical and theological perspectives, including his portrayal of justice, mercy, suicide and the angel of death.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Anson Vaux (2012).

In 1973, Eastwood told the film critic [[Gene Siskel]], &quot;No, I [[Atheism|don't believe in God]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gene Siskel, &quot;Clint: The Cynical King who Outdrew the Duke,&quot; ''Chicago Tribune'', January 7, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood has said that he finds spirituality in nature (as suggested by his Western, ''Pale Rider'', 1985), stating that &quot;I was born during the Depression and I was brought up with no specific church. We moved every four or five months during the first 14 years of my life, so I was sent to a different church depending on wherever we lived. Most of them were [[Protestant]], but I went to other churches because my parents wanted me to try to figure out things for myself. They always said, 'I just want to expose you to some religious order and see if that's something you like'. So although my religious training was not really specific, I do feel spiritual things. If I stand on the side of the Grand Canyon and look down, it moves me in some way.&quot;&lt;ref name=2011showbiz /&gt;

&quot;Of course, it would be wonderful to talk with my parents again, who are, of course, deceased. It makes the idea of death much less scary. But then again, if you think that nothing happens after you die, maybe it makes you live life better. Maybe you're supposed to do the best you can by the gift you're given of life and that alone.&quot;&lt;ref name=2011showbiz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.showbizspy.com/article/228386/clint-eastwood-on-the-fence-about-god-director-clint-eastwood-discusses-his-religious-beliefs.html |title=Clint Eastwood on The Fence About God!

Eastwood has been conscious of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and practices healthful eating habits. As a young man making a name for himself during the production of ''Rawhide'', Eastwood would be featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In the August 1959 edition of ''TV Guide'', for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, to take vitamins, and to avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan, p. 108&quot; /&gt;

On July 21, 1970, Eastwood's father died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 64.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan192&quot; /&gt; The death, described by Fritz Manes as &quot;the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life&quot;, came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92. It had a profound impact on Eastwood's life; from then on he became more productive, working with a greater sense of urgency and with more speed and efficiency on set.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan193&quot; /&gt; Although Eastwood had always been a health and fitness enthusiast, he became more so after his father's death. He abstained from hard liquor, adopted a more rigorous health regimen, and sought to stay fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan193&quot; /&gt; However, he still favored cold beer and opened a pub called the Hog's Breath Inn in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel-by-the-Sea]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan204&quot; /&gt; Eastwood eventually sold the pub and now owns the Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant, also located in Carmel-by-the-Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.missionranchcarmel.com/ |title=Welcome to Mission Ranch |publisher=Missionranchcarmel.com |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood is an [[audiophile]] and owns an extensive collection of [[LP album|LPs]] which he plays on a Rockport [[Phonograph|turntable]]. He has had a strong passion for music all his life, particularly jazz and country and western music.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan114&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; He dabbled in music early on by developing as a boogie-woogie pianist and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959 he produced the album ''Cowboy Favorites'', released on the [[Cameo-Parkway Records|Cameo]] label,&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan114&quot; /&gt; which included some classics such as [[Bob Wills]]'s &quot;[[New San Antonio Rose|San Antonio Rose]]&quot; and [[Cole Porter]]'s &quot;[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]&quot;.
